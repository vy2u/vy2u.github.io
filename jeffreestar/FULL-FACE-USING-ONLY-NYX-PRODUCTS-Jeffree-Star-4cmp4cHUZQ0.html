channel you see this brush yes the day
has finally came where I am about to do
a full face using only NYX products holy
shit I know a lot of you are out there
looking at your watches like girl my
hair is turning gray um I know it's been
a while
I did a Ulta I didn't all the whole
video a few months ago and then I did a
full face using only Maybelline products
which I bought in Malta and then I also
bought hundreds of NYX products and
they've been sitting here for a month or
two I played around with a few but then
there's also new stuff that just dropped
and I'm like oh my god so before I even
shot this video I'm like I'm gonna have
to get the new stuff or everyone at home
it's gonna slap me so today we are going
to do everything NYX - some of the
brushes because I did get some but I
didn't get a entire set or collection so
we'll just have to pick and choose
we have morphe brushes we have a bunch
of stuff and that is that before we dive
into the video let me just say a few
things if you guys don't mind I am
really really excited because September
9th is around the corner and finally me
and Manny anyway are restocking our
collaboration and not only are we
restocking the infamous bundle but we
are revamping the packaging here's a
little sneak peek of the inside and we
are bringing back the Eclipse skin frost
highlighter but if you buy the bundle
which this retails for only $50 you get
a brand new highlighter and what is that
highlighter it's called a Uranus and it
is a very beautiful striking pale gold
so if you get the bundle you get the
brand new highlighter it will also be
available individually so both skin
Frost's are returning as well as daddy
and I'm shocked liquid lipsticks so if
you want to get the bundle or anything
on part of this collection September 9th
10 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on jeffree
star cosmetics calm I am really really
stoked for everyone to see this and
here's a little sneak peak of Uranus I
know me and Manny have posted it all
over Instagram by now it is so buttery
my finger is just like bling-bling it's
really pretty so I'm just gonna do a
little swatch right here so you guys can
see what Uranus looks like oh my god
honey now of course I will not be using
us in today's video we're doing full
face NYX only but before we dive into
the video I am really excited to
announce that this video does have a
crazy giveaway I am giving away not one
not two not three but five separate Ulta
gift cards and they all will have 500
bucks on them here are the rules you

giveaway does end September 11th so be

box to see the winners I will of course
damn you on Instagram or hit you up on
youtube if you win so besides that you
guys let's dive in to the video so NYX
has so many damn primers when I bought
everything to do this video I stopped
there and I'm like oh my god I don't
know which one to use we have the honey
do me up which everyone said was a kind
of a dupe for the crazy expensive grill
on gold primer it looks very similar in
here
now of course NYX is a very drugstore
and affordable which is amazing so many
of you have asked why I've never really
used their products on my channel and I
haven't really just played with the
brand I know there's just so many brands
out there you guys really push me to try
it so thank you besides that we have the
studio perfect photo loving primer then
we have the classic og angel veil primer
I know a lot of you have been using us
for a while and then we have the hor
filler it creates a satiny smooth finish
minimizing the appearance of enlarged
pores I'm like should I use this and the
gold one maybe I think we should try
them out I mean if we have all these
sitting here we got to use a few of them
so let's see if we can get some primer
out oh it looks like a little like peach
type of color so I don't know how this
is going to work so I like to go kind of
minimal on let's just put on my nose and
my poor area so I'm just gonna Pat that
in let me take this honey
do me up and oh it's like a little
spatula whoa
this looks like I'm not gonna say it
alright so I'm just gonna take this and
we're gonna put it over all the areas
where we did not put the pore filler
all right our face is primed and now
we're gonna move on to foundation I have
been hearing so many mixed reviews about
the total control drop foundation now
these came out while ago I didn't get a
chance to review them yet
and well the day is here so here we are
so we are just going to give this a
shake of course this says that it can be
sheer to full coverage I know most of
you out there are like bitch I already
tried this well I haven't so let's see
what happens all right here we go
everybody oh my god now I'm gonna do one
side first because I'm not sure what the
hell is going to happen and is that too
much is that too little
y'all know my full coverage so let's see
here goes nothing okay well I definitely
look like a Casper the Friendly Ghost
mama I need some more drops
all right we are blended into perfection
now I do think that this foundation is
not bad I had no idea what to think as I
started to blend it out it was a little
thin it felt like weird it was
definitely a interesting texture that I
hadn't really experienced before but
looking closely it's not bad I almost
feel like I had even more coverage and I
know that you can add more and more
drops but I like how my skin's looking I
think the primer didn't do a bad job all
right you guys let's move on now
concealer are we ready to conceal I'm
ready to fucking conceal there are two
options I have this concealer corrector
and contour little brick here and then I
also have a this is the HD studio
photogenic concealer I don't know which
one is thicker I know everyone at home
is probably already knowing the answers
to this I'm gonna go on with this first
and here we go is this light enough for
me we shall see all right so this is
blended out not bad it seems a little
light from me which it almost like kind
of blended in with the foundation you
guys see a big like a big difference I
don't really I almost want to try it a
little bit in here girl what shade is
gonna be light enough for me in here
this is this is the lightest one we're
gonna see about that let me just take
this
oh my god okay I think this one is maybe
a little more hydrating on this side
from the brick and then the one by
itself it's kind of like not doing that
much so I'm just gonna go back in and
put a little bit more on this side bitch
give me some damn cuff before we dive
into contour I do want to use this HD
finishing powder hopefully it does not
give me any flashback I am going to use
this with a what kind of brush we going
you say what's a little kabuki brush and
let's see what happened now I think you
can use this to set your whole face I'm
going to assume translucent finishing
powder softens the appearance of fine
lines and pores while reducing shine and
mattifying all right let's chisel these
damn cheeks now of course we have the
iconic highlight and contour pro palette
a lot of people said this is a good dupe
last year for the anastacio
powder contour kit as well so we have
this to dive into if we want to we'll
dip in here but also I just got this on
ulta.com I was browsing for a new makeup
and there is a new three steps to sculpt
face sculpting palette not sure what the
difference is this one says on here I
mean you don't really say much this
shade is not in here which I like but I
think we're just gonna mix and match
today people let's see what the hell's
going on
so we'll dip in here first and oh wow
she's pigmented
now I'm gonna take a little morphe brush
and we're gonna dive into this one as
well I did a little on my cheek bone
area
I like how soft and pretty it looks it's
not too harsh did a little on the jaw
line now I'm gonna take this and just do
I'm scared let's try this shade we're
just gonna do a little bit on the
forehead area now to soften the contour
we're gonna dip into this light shade
right here we're just gonna go around
and make sure it looks really blended
and seamless all right we are contoured
and now it's time to do a little blush
before we highlight and I'm gonna go in
with the sweet cheeks blush palette this
looks really cute and I love how
versatile all the colors are so I think
for me I'm going to go in with this
little peach color let me take this out
of here I really want to do this top one
because it has a little bit of shimmer
in it as well but hmm kind of and with
the blush I'm not gonna go too heavy I'm
just gonna really focus it on the apples
of my cheeks and just kind of blend it
in to the front of the contour all right
the cheeks are looking cute and flushed
now this park was pretty cool it was
very easy to build up and just make it
really really nice so consistently the
powder formulas are pretty good I love
the contour powders they blended nice
speaking of cheeks before we go away I
also saw these brand new away.we glow
illuminating powders that's me this
looks like a shiny blush so I'm not sure
what this is really supposed to do I'm
just gonna take a little bit on this
brush and just swirling around okay
let's just put it right on top of here
and see if anything happens
oh girl not really and there really is
no glow oh my god this has to be like
the sheerest thing on earth okay
definitely love the normal blush palette
not a fan of this already it is too
sheer for me girl mm-hmm so NYX recently
put out this duo chromatic illuminating
powder highlighter I have never tried
this we're gonna have to give this a
whirl today it looks like this in the
pan hmm come on alien and also they put
out something called strobe of genius it
is a stick illuminating highlighter Wow
okay I think we should go in
right to our cheeks and let's see what
happens let's just say how this goes on
the skin
oh holy okay so this is gonna be a good
base I'm gonna take a dry Beauty Blender
and just go into the edges right there
now the trick is before it gets really
dry let's take this with a brush now
this shade is cold
Twilight tint but almost a Twilight
twink I'm a girl what is going on around
here oh okay okay
wowzers
alright we are intergalactically
highlighted this cheek is so intense I'm
obsessed with it okay them two together
that's a good combo alrighty now it's
time to move on to brows I know the main
event is definitely over sorry
highlighting I love you I wanna
highlight my old face again okay so for
brows we do have some options I grabbed
everything I could we have pencils we
have this crazy three-in-one brow
pencils
we got the powder pencil and the
three-in-one pencil and also we got some
tented brow pomade so we don't create
something out of those damn face I think
I'm gonna use this crazy guy because
look at this literally BAM like that is
a blonde brow so what I like to do is
sketch them out and then fill them in
pomade so let's get to it
alright so the outline is done and then
I'll take this Taemin frame tinted brow
pomade got this little angled brush
right here we're just gonna go in to
this damn pomade all right you guys the
pomade isn't that bad I kind of prefer
my dip brow from honest hacia a little
better this one is very light and
obviously a lot of brands do not make
products for someone that has zero hair
so I'm sure if you put this through hair
it would be amazing now if it was bad
just the consistency it was a little
weird for me but hey this brow is on and
the job is done now let me go do the
other side and I'll be right back the
brows are on girl
okay now as I said earlier this was not
my favorite brow product but definitely
it worked
took a little more finagling than normal
but the brows are on so now it's time to
move on to the eyes now of course y'all
know how to grab an eye primer and we
have the NYX proof it base basically
it's an eyeshadow base and it supposed
to be waterproof I'm like oh wow I guess
we're just gonna put this on our lids
and I have no idea what's about to
happen here
all right the base is on now I bought a
bunch of these Avant pop eyeshadow
palettes of course from NYX and then a
few weeks ago more palettes came out and
I'm my girl how the hell am I supposed
to keep up these new multi finished
shadow palettes just launched as well
and I'm like okay this color like story
here is giving me some life well let's
give this palette a whirl so you all
know what I like to do I'm gonna take a
brush just going straight to this bone
matte color and we're gonna coat our
lids and under our brow we're just gonna
prep out our brows even a little more of
the shadow all right and I forgot to
mention this is called the sugar high
palette now I'm gonna go in with this
peachy type of warm color I love this
vibe I'm feeling right here and let's
just see how she wants to blend
all right the peach color is blended now
the shadows did take a little bit more
work blending out like I had to go back
and back into the pan which is not like
the worst thing ever they just kind of
felt a little more on the cheap side so
shadows for me for a drugstore it's
either very hit-or-miss like they'll
kill it with some things but not always
everything is great which is okay
because if this works for you it works
for you I thought this is like a flop
for me definitely not yet it just took a
little bit more work so I think we are
ready to move on one I'm dying to try
this metallic shade right here but first
I am going to darken in my crease area a
little bit so let's just go in with this
color and then we're just gonna really
focus the brush right in here just to
create the illusion of it even deeper
crease
all right I went in there with this dark
color right here and then I'm also
blending the peach color over it to just
kind of go out and give it some more
drama now I think it's time that I try
this metallic shade I don't know whether
it's gonna work dry or wet because I've
never tested these formulas before so
I'm gonna go in with a little synthetic
brush right there and hmm it appears to
have some pigment but does it look that
metallic on the lid I guess we will find
out right now huh it's literally all
still on the brush what the actual fuck
that doesn't go very well did it that is
so disappointing
okay I'm going to wet the brush with
some setting spray and let's see if it
changes let's go in with that one more
time
oh the bristles are damp we got a little
bit more pigment
thank you Jesus because I was a little
worried is that my favorite in the world
no definitely not I don't even know if I
don't like it I'm like the setting spray
helped a little bit it's still very flat
and obviously the matte shades look
gorgeous
does the metallic kind of have a sloppy
moment yeah kind of I'm gonna do one
more time I almost want to dip into
something even brighter like this crazy
other one um let's just kind of mix and
match yeah just go in the inner corner
mm-hmm there we go
the metallic is looking a little better
now that it's wet definitely love the
feeling here now we are going to go into
I think this is like a metallic e color
these ones are like foil to me this one
is like kind of bronze II so I'm just
gonna take this and gently sweep it
below my lashline and let's see what
happens but so far I'm actually liking
how this look is turning out at first
the shadows were a little rough but I
think I'm liking them a little more now
that I got to at least spend some more
time with them so we're gonna take this
and just sweep this right under the eye
and just really blend it out pretty that
is blended or really nicely now to
really spice it up by
I have this aligner I mean if we're just
gonna go there let's fucking go there my
highlight is so obnoxious already so
this is a slide on glide on stone and
definitely a turn-on waterproof extreme
shine eyeliner Jesus Christ and then I
love how it says after it this eyeliner
is so good the name had to be this long
okay well let's give it a whirl and
let's see if it's true or not
so here is this color and this one was
called Azure I like it give us a weird
type of look definitely need some
mascara
okay so mascara today I don't know what
I'm gonna use we have these NYX one
called stacked let's look at the wand
here and let's see what stacked looks
like woah it's like flat and has like
piranha hairs on them let me hold my
hand up real quick woah okay so we have
that one and then we have this one which
is the NYX XXL okay and what is oh my
god girl how the hell is this gonna get
on my eye this brush is enormous and
y'all know I don't run from big things
but let me try out the stacked one first
and let's see what that one looks like
if I don't like it we'll try the other
one but that bristles those bristles
were large
okay
definitely don't love this one kind of
basic very basic mascara my lashes like
uh-huh my lashes look tired alright let
me try this big old brush oh okay we're
gonna zoom in right here it is very
clumpy like you see that like holy shit
okay we're gonna put this away and then
we're gonna take the bristles on the
other one come back and help separate
because this looks lumpy
God okay so I don't like either of those
mascaras I'm scared to do my bottom ones
now definitely scared those were not for
me the brush is just not what I'm
looking for in a mascara let me try to
do the bottoms with this I'm scared
all right so mascara is on now I do want
to say one thing that the waterproof
eyeliner is not that waterproof my eyes
literally never water up and if we zoom
in right here I'm gonna pull my skin
back it's already coming off right there
which is a little bit of an annoyance to
me
okay the stacked mascara is a little
better this brush was huge and a product
was a little too crazy for me but um
okay so I'm loving how the eyes are
looking now I definitely think it's time
for a lipstick oh my god now here's
where it gets tricky there are so many
lip products hell alright so I really
don't know what to beg you guys I've
been sitting here for a minute
of course there are a lot of formulas
this brand has of course the lingerie
they have the liquid suede and now they
have a brand new one which is the liquid
suede metallic matte and I'm like okay
we're in such a metallic era what about
this one you guys hmm I don't know it's
a little too red for this beautiful
orange type of I of course this hot
purple is not gonna fly and then the
only other metallica have it like this
dark dark like copper brown which i
still don't think matches the eyes so I
don't know I'm on the fence here let me
swatch this one and just see how it
looks because I don't even know what
this formula is about oh wow that is a
very metallic and very rose Pettus I
feel like it's just not matching this
look okay and then we have this what's
slave
I really can't pick I want to try a
lingerie one I'm like feeling a nude lip
I know you guys are like it was a really
really light this one is called chickees
let's try her out oh my god that
literally looks like concealer this
colors way she let you guys be right
back alright even though I said I wasn't
gonna do this color I'm just gonna try
it and see what happens
oh wow that just not match at all be
right back
alright so I have other nudes in here
let me try this one called baby doll
this one was so light I'm like let's
pray this one looks a little better with
this eye look okay I'm not mad at this
one it's very easy
okay this formula is weird y'all alright
the nude lip is on not my favorite lip
products I tried the liquid suede
off-camera and I really liked it of
course this is the metallic swatch on my
hand damn girl that's pigmented or the
lingerie not my favorite formula but it
did blend out a little easier as it
started to dry but look at this mess
right here you guys what in the fuck
okay now last but not least what else do
we gotta do we gotta find some damn
setting spray I had so many setting
sprays we have the matte finish
long-lasting and there's another
long-lasting that says do we and I'm
like hmm
a lightweight water-based setting spray
that keeps your makeup looking dewy and
am AC ing through any kind of weather
well let's give her a whirl there we go
let's set this face smells like medical
spray almost huh and how is my skin
looking oh my god like I need to move
buff in the setting spray that sprayed a
lot thicker than I thought give me more
all right let's zoom in and give our
final thoughts alright guys so here is
of course the final look and I'm gonna
do a little run-through of my favorite
products and the ones I did not love so
I think what stood out the most for me
was obviously the highlighter you guys
see it it is blinding it's beautiful I
love the stick mixed with the powder I
think it looks behind in the sides that
I thought the primer did really well I
love mixing them both the gold one was
definitely mm-hmm and the foundation
overall now that it's been about an hour
so I'm looking here and I'm not mad at
it oh I think it looks really pretty a
little you know not as full full
coverage as I love it
setting powder was alright a little
chalky but the overall powder I put in
my entire face looked great I'm looking
the monitor like those eyes are not bad
the eyeshadow palette was good I
actually really liked it the ultimate
multi finish it did me well and the
eyeliner does look good it did come off
a little bit in here so I went in and
did
again that second layer did beautiful
now things that I did not like so well
the shimmer shadows on here were a
little rough until they were wet you
know that I know I'm like I love the
palette but I also kind of didn't love
it at the same time I kind of want to
use some of their other palettes in
future videos to give them a whirl so
that would definitely have to do a look
after that
now the eyeshadow primer it did pretty
good I think it made it look great wait
we're talking about things I don't like
you guys look at me I'm like trying to
find the good in everything right now
things I did not love the damn mascara
what in the hell these brushes are not
good I'm definitely gonna have to try
out different ones because these two
kind of flopped for me and besides that
just setting spray is that anything too
bad I don't really look dewy though so
I'm like girl dewy what I'm like I need
more like bitch I don't feel Joey right
you guys besides that thank you so much
for waiting so patiently for this video
or not so patiently I know a lot of you
who have been anticipating my thoughts
so overall I feel like all the products
I use as a whole were good and
consistent of course we had a few flops
but hey if there is an entire makeup
line that is going to happen so remember
you guys do not forget to enter my
giveaway if you skip through this video
watch the intro and you'll find out the
details all right but besides that I
will see you guys on the next video
thank you as always for watching
muah love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
