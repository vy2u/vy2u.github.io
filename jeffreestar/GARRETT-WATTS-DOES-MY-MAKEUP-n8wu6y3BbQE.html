I thought you liked makeup one time I
was at like a like a garage sale hold
this up oh sorry here I was at a garage
sale once upon a time and I opened this
box up and it was just full of makeup
and I said hey why is this here and she
said oh because I used to be a makeup
artist and I'm quitting and she said do
you want it for twenty dollars I say
yeah like your this is so real right
yeah it's so real so Annette I sometimes
goof up like oh yeah boy you touch
everything I did like it like a video
where I became it and there's all these
like gross oh wait look at this fresh
scab for a Halloween makeup oh oh my god
this is chanel limited edition hookups
can we zoom in on the hair limited
edition is that a beard hair a pubic
hair what's going on there Garrett told
me that everything oh okay did you
really get his idea garage sale is she
sold this whole thing to me for $20 this
is really good powder can I have this
yes
some of this is like like brand-new and
then some of it is not yeah she said she
did - well I - oh blasco's really good

did blade - I think caller mates wow
that good stuff oh my god a little mac
bag this is like vintage matte cosmetic
stuff oh my god cue bad
like a brand-new powderpuff she used on
me today you can use it to wipe away my
sweat so you actually did eh I tried
following a Geoffrey start to Torah
makeup tutorial yes iconic video yeah
yeah I'm so glad you got to use my name
for your sponsor okay check when you
respond it up it's like when you said
you watch it I was like oh god I'm gonna
just grab a bunch of products and I'm
gonna say hey this is for this and you
just you know your canvas I'm nervous
like how much is this stuff also I
googled last night how to do makeup they
were like twelve steps it was like
foundation primer yeah I just kind of
skimmed it I'll teach you I need to know
because when I did your makeup for the
video
I followed a Geoffrey start tutorial I
just kind of goofed around a little bit
and like kind of tried but not really
cuz Shane and Ryland were behind me like
hassling me so I couldn't really like it
wasn't that good yeah in the end I use
Cheetos and stuff I saw yeah burned home
really burned my eyes yeah I don't want
that people are gonna learn right now
that I'm the king of makeup and I'm
going to do very good so yes okay cool
okay so we're gonna go describe a bunch
of products um and we're gonna you're
gonna see how I get ready and you're
gonna do me I'm so nervous
so primer so the sir primer is to lay
down before the foundation so it sticks
and it just lasts all day okay so what's
the price point for this little moment
you think that's probably oh I'd say
fifty to eighty dollars oh okay that
good yeah you're guessing high which I
live for us so this this new primer is
120 damn yeah
someone let you apply it okay oh it
looks like should I wash my hands or
something I know they're fine I mean I'm
good I don't like put my hands on my
butt or anything like they're normal
hands sorry just put on all my little
fingers they're not little they're clean
good apply it evenly and just smooth me
down are you serious yeah this is so
exciting
