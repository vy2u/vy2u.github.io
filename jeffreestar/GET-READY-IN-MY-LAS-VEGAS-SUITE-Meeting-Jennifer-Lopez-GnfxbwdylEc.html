we're just gonna do a little chitchat
and get ready today I just love the vibe
of this whole like this moment is
everything then of course you got a
little two chairs for me and Nate to sit
here smoke one and stare at the Eiffel
Tower so here is another lounge area
like the fourth one it's crazy so I
don't know I don't know that many people
in this room so I'm gonna have to have a
little family reunion if I ever want to
fill it up but honestly I just love the
openness I don't care if I'm just in
here alone reading a book later after
everything is winded down I just love a
chill environment um are you guys so I
think it's time I stop running my mouth
let's jump into this tutorial and get
started all right you guys so we are
going to start this tutorial right now
David is giving me some little buns
what'd you just call it a Chumlee mom
yes a little streetfighter moment we are
gonna do a wig tonight for the JLo show
so we're just gonna dive into this face
because time is ticking and girl the
lighting in these hotel rooms are deadly
so we're gonna go in of course with our
infamous I don't know why I'm saying
infamous with our famous Bobby Brown a
vitamin-enriched based base I have been
using this forever and I think I've used
it in the last three tutorials I'm
addicted
I've already of course damp into my
Beauty Blender we're using the Tiffany
egg to
and let's just get this alligator skin
moisturised cuz girl I am dry
all right you guys so it's Jennifer
Lopez tonight our skin needs to look
extra snatch so we're gonna go in with
my favorite cocktail the Dior air flash
foundation and Vila mayor soft fluid
foundation and when you combine these
two it's a wrap you look plastic baked
and ready to conquer the world now I'd
like to take this you can spray this any
way you want on a brush on the blender I
like to go directly on my face so oh
come on Ches tattoos whoa
now with the lemare I like to take it
and literally just bam bam and I like to
do sections at a time on my face I'm
just gonna kind of bounce this
everywhere and I'm gonna push it really
hard into my skin you are the boss so
your skin may give you wrinkles pimples
and everything else the bitch remember
you are the puss so really push this
into the skin and make sure it's gonna
last all night
hmm what the play Space Jam later with
your crotch all right you guys now of
course we need concealer let me see that
oh whoa David is about to do one of the
new dr. dark shaped and shot masks look
at this so creepy but so cool so I
bought a bunch of these but having them
yet yeah so you're using the witch's
rubber hydro mask instant hydration
boost will you shake it in here yeah
it's like two little things that you mix
up and shake it and stir with the straw
and then you play it first impressions I
got a week I'm gonna watch you do it on
my side I might be free all if you will
okay free concealer you guys this is the
first time I'm actually gonna talk about
this on camera I have used the new
Jeffrey star concealer formula before
but no one knew about it I'm actually
gonna do that today
so I'm gonna go blend out some concealer
and be right back I know you guys are
gonna be a girl that is so shady I
literally don't have any other concealer
except my own because I've been testing
it out so be right back my shady ass is
back ready to put on some setting powder
we're gonna go in with the Patrick Starr
Mac collaborations
powder today I love this formula and you
guys know what I like to do is put a lot
of powder over here and over there
David is shaking his mess that looks so
it's dripping like it's like water like
crazy uh-huh well I'm gonna set my
concealer okay so when I walked into
this hotel room you guys BAM a lot of
you may be asking why are you at Planet
Hollywood
because JLo is performing here and the
venue is inside the hotel so I thought
what better place to stay I actually
normally don't stay at Planet Hollywood
ever
I love Vdara or Aria or Hard Rock is of
course iconic but um we're here today
and this room is sickening literally I
think my entire family could stay here
if they wanted to powder is on you can't
even tell there's finishing powder on me
not finishing we're setting alright so I
need to make sure that I look as fake as
possible tonight so I'm gonna take my
Chanel loose powder we're gonna go in
with that and put it all over the face
and before we even do that I'm over here
like you know what fuck it so we're
gonna take the shredder Tilbury airbrush
flawless finish that's a tongue twister
and we're gonna put that under our eyes
so even more if you guys thought I was
gonna set it once you're wrong we're
meeting JLo tonight like David we gotta
look so much
get it together all right so we're gonna
go into the little contour or bronzer if
you will I'm just gonna kind of sculpt
my face very like Oh today and we're
gonna go in with the lemare bronzer I've
been using this for ever now it's been
months it's just called the bronzing
powder simple and effective hi I'm David
over there we're gonna go pan to David
real quickly looking like swamp face
over
or my so what does that feel like is it
cool is it burning
kollene it's like really um it feels a
little tingly alright so we're gonna cut
our cheeks I'm my girl your contour is
so snatched I'm like who's doing J Lo's
makeup these days I know I should
probably know that you guys but you know
David oh no just Chris out the things
doing her hair now hair looks fucking
the flawless always alright you guys we
are bronze contoured and laid as good as
we're gonna get for now I know a lot of
you watching this may be like what's
happening well the lighting I don't know
how bad the Lighting's gonna be once we
edit this motherfucker but the Sun is
setting right as we speak so mommy needs
to race for the finish line oh my god
can we talk about full panic mode
alright we're gonna do a little bit of
blush just a little bit of coloring we
have two we got a color in our
cheekbones we're gonna go in with the
Gucci blush
what is the shade called Gucci face soft
peach so like I don't wanna say the word
natural but it's just really pretty and
it's really pigmented
so little bit goes a long way it's down
we don't want to get any highlighters on
the birkin for a highlighter I'm really
excited because I snapped about this the
other day and so many people were mad
because I wouldn't tell you what it is
yeah well now here we are now in me
doing makeup in my Tesla video I use
this this is the Kevyn Aucoin brand new
prismatic highlighting trio now this
color right here enchanted is what I had
on my face on the freeway and it was so
blinding I went home and actually put
something over it and it shocked me how
pretty it was so let's start here and
you know what I like to do I'm actually
gonna wet the brush a little bit now
this is the Kevin of Wan palette we're
gonna stick Kevin up on highlighting
brush I love this one let's use the
Mario little allo spray hi there now
we're just gonna take this like this
most formula is a little little chunky
but it works so good like I don't mind a
little bit of fallout like what is in
this to make it so stunning so I switch
brushes real quickly mister
blend this ow I just love this ether ol
like alien glow I'm dying what do you
think mrs. Doubtfire you look like you
just put your face in the cake now I'm
layering this because we want to be
really extra tonight like come on okay
so you guys remember in October last
year we went to see Britney Spears I
just love a good Vegas show and we live
so close to Vegas it's like JLo is a
given now we have Elton John coming here
we have the Backstreet Boys right now
like David we need to come here a little
more often
yes be savage we have to do Cupid's bow
everyone sorry yes
Backstreet Boys it's like hi yeah hi
seventh grade we're bagging all right
you guys so now you're probably asking
all right what else did you do on
snapchat the other day we are about to
do it right now so thank you Kevin
applying live for you girl
now Stila has brand new glare and glow
highlighters out oh my god they're so
stunning and I'm gonna put one directly
on top and blend it with my finger you
ready for this you're gonna die for this
yeah so this is already like holy shit
right you ready for this you put it
right on top now obviously it's gonna
look streaky and weird you have to blend
it in so before it dries because it
drives quick yeah so pretty it's like
what is happening here a lesson a
highlight is bilenda and I'm not gonna
put this anywhere else the other places
are fine we don't even clutter on our
Cupid's bow all right now we're going to
jump into the eyes we're just gonna do a
very soft subtle glam really all make it
about just the cheeks and skin and not
be full full-on of course we're going to
dive into the blood sugar palette today
so let's grab some blending brushes and
let's get started all right so we're
gonna go over the glucose right here and
we're just gonna softly and harshly Pat
it everywhere and really give our lid
something like to talk about and you
guys know it's 2018 I haven't really
been
Brow's lately so we're just gonna take
that up into the actual brow area as
well
so come on brow bone okay so Tana just
texted me and she is gonna be in Vegas
tonight
she literally lands in like four hours
I'm like imagine she should be here
doing a get ready with me which I
definitely want to do one day but if
Tana is in town tonight I'm gonna try to
meet up with her I don't know when the
JLo show ends but that would be so fun I
just want to get high with her and chill
I just feel like you know when you like
have never met someone before but you
just know you're gonna Bible with them
that's how I feel about her all right
now we're gonna dip into tongue pop and
we're just gonna place that right in the
crease right here my deep set crease
first of all can we talk about blood
sugar for a second like two days ago the
pre-order is sold out as well so I'm
just like it's overwhelming like this is
such a amazing feeling from just
starting three years ago you guys - now
I just can't believe how much has
happened with YouTube with my brand with
my entire life it's just all so it's a
lot overwhelming and I think sometimes
life just moved so quickly you kind of
forget to really like I don't know take
it all in like sometimes I'm just on the
go so much I don't even really get to
celebrate some accomplishments because
I'm already you know on to the next
moment but blood sugar was just such a
cool like I always say a moment but it's
such a cool moment like and still for it
to sell out and then a pre-order to sell
out I'm like I can have any palettes to
like fucking the end of March or April
but I am gonna make it permanent it is a
permanent item so if you guys want it
you will get it I know waiting sucks
sometimes but hey okay well we're
looking snatch all right now I'm taking
a little Bobby Bobby blender Bobby Brown
eye blender and we're just gonna dip
into glucose again just soften tongue
pop out a little bit now let's take this
little morphe blending brush and let's
dip into shade cavity do we want to do a
cavity or do we want to do cherry soda
I'm looking
right now like you do both right I mean
hi it's my palette let's do cherry soda
first so we're gonna take cherry soda
and start packing it right in there and
coming down on the lid Oh who's your
master done yeah you're real quick hey
yeah rubber baby oh yeah
it looks so old whoa it feels like um
yeah I mean it's a little rubber mmm oh
my god your facial hair this is gonna be
so wait now I hope I don't pop my little
hairs right oh my god I'm like look
what's right under him oh yeah she's
going over here
somebody throw that on there whoa oh
it's coming up easy huh I wonder what
makes up oh my let's take jiggly it's
like oh it really is not that bad
actually okay so were you getting a wipe
off the excess hmm okay I don't feel
overall it feels nice and hydrated
you don't feel old and bitter anymore
yeah all right we are blended down to
the gods and now we're gonna go into
shade extraction and we're just gonna go
with this little pointed brush we're
just gonna add a little bit of depth in
there so my crease looks so fucking deep
set anyone else live in Michigan because
in a two days I'm gonna go visit my
house and Grand Rapids do some work on
it visit Nate's parents Nate's actually
going to LA because our daughter drama
cannot be left alone in my eyes for more
than a day or two so one of my close
friends was at my house right now
watching all the dogs but girl I'm like
me drama does not want to be left alone
so I got to go make sure the house is
secure this is looking really cute and
then I'll be back in LA for two days and
then I'm off somewhere else it just
never ends you guys the plane rides the
lack of sleep all right now we're gonna
take a highlighting brush we're actually
going to dip into shade candy floss and
we're gonna act like a buffer almost
like a highlighter you can actually use
it as a highlighter if you want baby
when you put this on the
like mixing with tongue pop and cherry
soda it just gives it this like no it's
just so pretty
David my hair is acting like the Rugrats
that's what happens in you say hey David
can you do my hair and you have two
minutes it was yeah look at this well
fell flat in the back alright so we're
just putting candy floss all the way up
here literally we're just blending David
you should do candy floss for
highlighter tomato okay yeah look
something fucking yes JLo yes I'm living
for this moment okay guys let's we're
okay we're doing this brush again we're
going in a tongue pop we're actually
just gonna take this before we do
anything else and just drag it under our
lash line and we're just gonna smoke it
out really easy
alright cool this is looking really
pretty now I'm actually going to add a
little bit more and then we should be
good I am living for this red fantasy we
definitely need to add some more cotton
candy in the inner corner so we're gonna
take this little brush no let's to a
pencil brush my life I lied and I forgot
my setting spray which is very
depressing we do have this so we're just
going to wet the brush a little bit and
then we're gonna barely touch in there
oh my god
and we're just gonna add that right and
name
oh wow all right now to add a little pop
of glitter we're gonna go in with the
Stila this is shade wanderlust but this
is the liquid eye shadow glitter and
glow not to be confused with its older
sister which now looks like this
for the highlighter we used on the
cheeks I mean is it the same formula I
haven't even looked in the ingredients
but I just want to have a little pop of
glitter to my lid so we're gonna take
this and just go right in there see that
we're gonna connect cotton candy down
there and then we're gonna go half way
on our lid so we're not gonna cover up
everything we're just gonna go half way
and then to make sure that doesn't look
nasty you can really take your finger if
you want or a brush it doesn't really
matter and you just kind of want to
blend it so it goes together with your
lid it doesn't let go chunky or chalky
fingers work you guys now I really just
need some liner and lashes all right now
we're gonna go in with our roller lash
from benefit we got to coat these lashes
and of course we're gonna do some false
lashes I brought a bunch of bears when I
travel I always bring like 50 pairs you
never know what kind of mood you're
gonna be in when I follow tannaz
tutorial and she did mascara after the
lashes I'm still traumatized so thank
you for that but we're of course gonna
put our mascara on right now I feel so
naked without it like I know how she
does that all right you guys know I like
to hold my breath while I'm doing my
eyes I never really try to talk take a
shot every time I say girl in my last
seven videos okay sorry you guys I'm
just on a girl okay when I was in eighth
grade I started saying that like I would
call grown-ass men who were six five I'm
like what's up girl yeah girl remember
the old days that's that was my
childhood oh oh girl I would call the
plumber girl I call the cable man the
guy at fucking the grocery store I'm
like Oh
you guys epic fail mascara to the nose
ha all right you guys I'm gonna go to
the bathroom I'll be right back
mother fucker look at me running my
mouth about making fun of guys and
calling them women our girl not women it
was really just about like calling
everyone girl but life was like be quiet
thank you all right girl
ha ha ha ha now Jayla show isn't for a
while and we're gonna do some activities
we're gonna gamble so I may not put any
false eyelashes on I know a lot of you
were like are you fucking kidding me so
I don't know if I'm gonna do false
lashes right now I think we should move
on and then later after I'm done
chilling and relaxing and dinner then
maybe I'll pop some on so for this video
ok so let's move on to lip I mean I
don't even know
I'm just gravitating towards a nude my
hair is gonna be babe fuck I'm not used
to these my hair might be baby pink it
might be blonde I don't know yet but I
think we should have stick to a nude lip
so really my favorite nudes that I've
ever made are mannequin and Christmas
cookie I think since Christmas cookies a
little newer let's use that one again
all right now what I usually do when I
go out and know in the real world I'll
take this flawless powder and this
chanel again and I'll kind of fine-tune
at the Beautyblender and see any spots
that may have creased a little or
anything that needs a little extra
product you know you're just kind of
fine-tune what you've already created
and bam you guys I think we are pretty
much done remember I sadly forgot
setting spray how how I have no idea so
I'm just gonna use this one more time
and I don't wanna do too much you can
say something to my makeup so if I'm
ever nervous about that I'll take the
Beauty Blender again and I'll just kind
of like press it in to the skin that's
perfect timing since we are literally
done literally and figuratively
we just finished Nate oh really meaning
me me and my hands look at my highlight
yeah I glitter and metallic look hi JLo
weeping girl all right you guys thank
