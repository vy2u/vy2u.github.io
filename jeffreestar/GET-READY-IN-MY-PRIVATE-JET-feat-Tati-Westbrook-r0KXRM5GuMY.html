my size yes dissipate repeat you know so
I was indeed any little putting on
makeup and I just was obsessed with it
to the start I was just born to love it
and my mom peace watercolor artist so I
kind of picked up a lot of that for her
I think
I never not love kind of I was
pretending to be a makeup artist and I
was ten doing my job I'm like oh yeah so
now so what was your the was your first
makeup job
I've been dying to know that love plan
we're going to counter like my first job
ever was at Mac and every center of the
mall
I worked in a kiosk I forgot about that
okay look er Xian so in mineral makeup
and shiny nose I would show you how to
turn it into light nail polish - my god
I remember those yeah I was that person
that was like chase you down the mall
and you like you needed I lived that
life for a minute and then I worked for
Nordstrom of the bareMinerals Center Wow
come on bareMinerals yeah oh my god
Brow's on this moving plan right now I
know come on browse Pilate said that
well we are like we're going over the
mountains but they're a little
turbulence over the mountain so this it
works well it's like a d'Arnaud I know
right packaging if the putty blush and I
don't want it you're gonna die you're
going to die I want to try a bunch of
pretty stuff on my channel because even
Laura do so many funny things like how
do you make a challenge
really pretty that silver sail my toes
do okay I'm that classical grab-ass so
that's the tool and worn but I
discovered into conversing he's a little
s hometown palette so lipstick make my
makeup artists always myself wrong today
she put a dipping into safe word which
is a very cool toned soft brown color in
my palette then is so good for
contouring I might hit Hannah my own
politics a god I know yeah for anyone
yeah probably have a few backup right
let's take about cutting cheek long how
does that work I've - nothing suntan
with her right now
what did that just do that's eight
why alright so I'm going to do a little
highlight for brows today I've been
doing this a lot lately I did this in
high school and now that there's so many
highlighting products I am back to
highlighting and just not doing any
brows I love that look so I've always
wanted to know and I don't know if this
is too personal or not but your brow
situation yeah tell me more wives in a
row ok so when I was in high school I
really began to make up and my real
brows are really low okay I wanted a lot
more room right so I was like hey I'm a
shaving them off of my mom's legs I mean
cool like look if you have good grades I
was straight advanced you can look
however the hell you want you do you so
I shaved them off and I started riding
on really high in high school I give you
look at whole picture drinking like oh
my god girl chill out it really defines
more room and I never left the throwback
and I just kind of always cleaning it
yeah and I've been drying them on for so
long now so when those funny things come
out like stencils and stamps on my girl
yeah old-fashioned free handing them on
that's the way to go for me yes so
you're using the new urban decay heat
Palais which for some reason someone
watched online all weird and the whole
internet exploded with like this is
shady everyone's lying and I'm like girl
urban decay is consistently great oh
it's really nice I like it it looks
amazing with pigmented blending grades
just I fucking normal pallet I don't
know what everyone's deal is I guess it
may sound a little silly
what got you into reviewing all this
amazing expensive stuff you know I am a
luxury brand for a lot of expenses
makeup I love designers and I really
fell in love with all your reviews
because you know a lot of people think
oh well if something expensive of work
you know and it doesn't and I think I
was out to prove that because I was in
where one night I was in Neiman's and I
saw the Louboutin lipstick
9200 expect that's kind of what started
it all yeah this was a couple years ago
yeah first watch those I was so excited
I picked it up and I asked what the
price was and my first response was
literally like what the fuck yeah when
they told you yeah there were 93 years
know they're 90 yeah they're nice and
you're like oh I'm like I'm the
packaging is funny it looks like an
Egyptian like crazy is going to decorate
a Christmas tree with a little video a
little ornament but I felt like it would
be a really fun review and I felt like
it would be a really cool first
impressions to kind of this resin is no
one had really refuted to you and went
viral and it's for having me to try more
expressive makeup okay and it kind of
just kicked off from there I love that
when I was first looking at YouTube
stuff when I was starting my channel I
was like okay all I wear is a lot of
this expensive shit are people going to
be like weird about air they going to be
different everybody's been so cool to
the plane was it just me I don't want to
speak something or not
well yes and I think lately I'm really
happy that so many extra brands or
certificates or formulas because it's
like when we were younger drugstore was
not always the bed with not at all that
formulas were garbage right left to make
a 99-cent for my lipstick work for a
pageant make did you did know where it
is live like yes now they're making
highlighter it's horrible - Tom Ford and
I'm like oh okay
we're in our homeland no I'm just doing
it before I sit down at school no I love
it cuz everyone does a different bigger
highlighting to highlight what am i
highlighting I usually like to highlight
to last because I kind of like to see
the balance of everything okay I love
that I love that your husband is so
supportive of everything you do yes and
everybody
actually I have no one everybody thinks
but from day one when I thought I wanted
to start my channel if you know so
supportive and I had a boyfriend for
jeans where I wanted to start a YouTube
channel and they were going or not
supporting Wow oh that's embarrassing
don't do it embarrassed I don't think
it's a good idea
oh no John that was your boyfriend stuff
right he's like dude I'll be wrong oh
yeah it's not supportive and I was
really trying to James James Mike
entrepreneur has had many successful
businesses yeah he was all about me
having fun you know and I I was good
when I started out because when you
upload your video to me in your very
first one like we're going it's so cool
oh my god looking back at the history
like her evolution and a youtuber is so
cool to be like you were around before
crazy ring lights and he knows and be
valets and all these things like cool
some of deepening this creep over here
what are we doing okay that lets us look
really pretty
like though right we're getting there
we're blending our lives away and are
whisked away yes and I'm realizing I
haven't make an emergency work Stern
literally can throw a tantrum because I
didn't go no you did not
well I have a brand new roller lash and
I don't have the guy you might weigh all
right here Cottle I'm sharing with
people that I might know all right if
you're a stranger on the street I don't
know if I'd let you use my man I don't
know I promise okay before we get to
mascara I think the most important steps
on Twitter like you get up down with the
skinny dip yeah I've got my little oil
and now we can litter I'm going to use
these cela and smoldering satin the
difficulty metal yeah and then what kind
of cakes like boring - fabulous really
fast
honestly next level once white look at
that Oh bro my favorites you guys they
already know what it is for those and
they keep putting out new colors and I
was like bring it on
so yesterday Tati texted me a really
sweet message we watched my story time
video that was really cool of you to let
you know we just even taking about your
day like watch something I think is
really awesome what do you really think
about it because it's a little scary to
be vulnerable online so many people have
opinions and I'm like you know what I
don't have anything to lose I'm going to
be really real with my audience I just
share some things that I think are
important and I think that you need to
open up even more and obviously your
audience love just so much I personally
really loved it
I loved what you had to say about your
relationship obviously but also for the
imprint that I connected with was people
hating on you for being successful or
we're getting to this place because I
didn't always have a very big life I
really came from nothing and I know that
you have a similar story oh and like I
love that you remind people to get
inspired instead of jealous where if you
see someone with a nice bag and I play a
nice anything you want that and come up
with your plans oh yes yes and execute
it and never give up I mean it's taken
ten long years I also like short years
didn't but it also a long journey of you
know from a all the way to be and I
think people forget that because they're
just seeing me now I think throw I think
people I don't know what they think but
it's like didn't know me even three
years ago yeah now there are two bedroom
little apartment you know not sure how
to put food on the table for me
and you know and my family may need help
yeah I'm helping pay rent for people
while I can barely go in a tent but you
know I'm trying to find food for my dogs
and it's just like you know it's a while
to see how people react to success and I
think it's so bizarre that people are so
negative people don't know how to be
inspired anymore because there's just so
much negativity on there well the other
thing that we'll know is it's not quick
you don't just like think of a dream and
tomorrow get a you gotta find that
mountain you got to get to work and you
got to put yes exactly and I think
people forget that right no I liner over
here on a plane hmm I mean it dangerous
remaking it there I really wanted to do
story time and I think maybe I will
that's scary huh it is very scary for
lips today having to become food for the
new shade from the limo line this is
birthday suit clouds are really pretty
nude sort of select that creamsicle
though
I know I'm like I am all about the yummy
sense with lip products when they in
case like oral I can't I can't
sober draws a little extreme today but

normal glam but I'm getting it done I'm
making it work
