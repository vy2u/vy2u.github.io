praise well go you know on the anti
SeaWorld's I was just trying to be fish
and swim all right I'm gonna fuck this
parade of this fucking foundation oh I'm
ready to get up in my cakey Bakey shaky
won-soon making okay so I heard a little
rumor that you were supposed to
allegedly be on all-stars
now I cannot confirm you're speaking of
darling you know we sign contracts
overhead entertainment industry but what
I will say is you've been conquering the
world and it was a really great choice
and it was a wonderful choice you know
I'm so proud of Alyssa it's been amazing
to just like I host a little viewing
party in North Hollywood at Cobra and
it's been so fun to just watch my mother
and my friends and cheer them on and to
be honest you know I got to choreograph
the VMAs for Miley Cyrus and I had I
done that all-stars gig I probably
wouldn't have been able to do that I
know such a cool moment like that
exactly a such a huge moment and now
girl I'm choreographing for Brooke candy
so she's just moving on and upward to
keeping this you know career as an
artist not just a dry clean alive and I
love that I think it's
and part of your legacy mean your that's
what your fucking amazing ass well you
know on all-stars they lip-synch for
their legacy baby I'm living for my
legacy ok ok I love that
now I think we should just dive right in
there I'm gonna be the first one to say
it
Alyssa you got fucking robbed bitch
robbed aah baby they have pulled the
patch the rug the full kit and kaboodle
on her robbed like that was dirty baby
that was our third now if you haven't
watched this season of all-stars -
you're definitely missing out because
I'm just gonna say it out loud it's TV
gold Oh baby I have something that
RuPaul is a genius he said himself he's
a marketing genius and maybe this season
has been so juicy oh it's unreal peach
emoji can't that's just not even enough
to describe how how'd you see this
husband okay really turn it the fuck oh
yeah so hardcore and I think it's so
cool because the show it keeps growing
and growing yeah
it really does and I don't think it's
slowing down no it's amazing girl I was
on the show almost four years ago and
I'm still working as a drag queen
thanks to RuPaul's Drag Race it's fuckin
awesome yeah now only thing I will say
is what am I gonna be a judge on the
show um um hi my watch is ticking huh
girl I feel like I don't know that's
just yeah you need to be a judge I mean
I I need you to be a judge on that show
for sure I know the fans have voted
before and it still hasn't happened so
everyone um hi let's get on that please
you would slay the panel you would be
sitting there tits up done bid John I'm
done I think it would be so fun
so um hi RuPaul if anyone's watching
this call me I think that what happened
to Alyssa was so dirty
well that was started like for two
friends just like you know what honey
bye we know you're sickening and you
know you might win so it's over girl I'm
I just think Alyssa really deserved it I
mean I know it's not a category by
wanting wanting it should be and I'm
telling you she wanted it more than any
of those girls I mean she's a pageant
girl at heart you know so to her it's
not just a title but it is this legacy
it is traveling the world with RuPaul's
name and saying like I am you know the
next drag superstar all far and so soon
I mean whoever wins you know that they
are going to be great they are all
Allstars it's true it really is true but
they're there for a reason they are
there for a reason but I really wanted
to see a list to take the crown
obviously she's my mama right exactly
and I don't you know I don't know a lot
of these people on the show you know I
know I feel them really well some of
them not at all so I don't really want
to speak to ill-will of any one horse
but it's like this season I really
thought you know maybe Fifi would have a
heart and have a moment but you know
everyone always wants to say editing but
you did act like that well here's what I
have to say about that girl
as somebody who had a very tumultuous
time on season 6 yes you know I came off
that show and I could have totally been
one of those girls to be like I blame
editing I blame editing but at the end
of the day I owned up to Who I am who I
was and that was an outlandish crazy-ass
iconic don't you forget it mama honey
boo boo child character I know people
people loved it or hated it but they
remembered it and you know I think those
editors have a job to do girl they've
got people to feed themselves they do
you give them family you give them the
footage that you give them yes so you
can't expect to turn around and and be
you know upset about that I'm gonna say
I'm gonna say something the first you
know three episodes there was a lot of
laganja quotes oh so I kind of felt like
you were there and spirit to be oh girl
you know I I definitely think my Lango
has lived a life of its own it has I
think it's so genius and you know this
is Geoffrey star making a public
announcement i think laganja is at the
most iconic entrance ever so put that on
the fucking books
well baby death drops in tom pop well
what I really do want to say about Fifi
is regardless of editing and all that
nobody deserves to get that online hate
that she's been getting something has
got to be done about these people with
keyboard courage
I'm saying just a bunch but as the
population grows and there's more and
more people in social media it's just
getting worse right and everyone's
always talking about anti-this anti-that
let's tip it but it's not happening and
it's awful and I think yeah I mean
you're on a TV show and that's that but
people act like that's really him every
second day and it was just like a door
and Michelle Michelle got so much hate
that first episode
Oh people like tweeting her death
threats and crazy shit it's a TV show
like everyone needs to relax right and
if we didn't have these dynamic cares
and these villains the TV show wouldn't
be as good just like with me if I wasn't
on there crying and doing all those
extras that wouldn't have been such a
vibrant and crazy season right now so we
have to look at it for what it is take
it as the TV show but also remember
we're all humans behind these lenses
okay and we all forget that though they
do a lot a lot at the time and that
sucks he's under eyes though are looking
airbrush well baby I'm moist okay I'm
fully moist now you know I've started
doing this new thing where I do like a
lot of my makeup now with the foundation
wet so like when I do the brows if I
mess up it's so much easier just like
fixing that what's cool about your
routine is my routines change so much
throughout the years like I did not used
to do my face like this I would take
concealer and cover my entire forehead
to neck and then just use foundation and
press that motherfucker in is she
reading me these the shade I was out
you're doing forehead to neck concealer
though no yeah no but you're like at the
full coverage foundation yeah I use a
little concealer pots before this was
invented uh-huh don't you know I don't
even try me
hunty ha ha you know what I'm kind of
deciding what I have so many crazy eyes
shadows here I might do no brows
Oh bitch you tried to be oh I really
don't know like I don't know I've been
doing a lot of new brow look on my
channel no I saw it is sickening it is
fun
so for me I'm gonna go over here and try
to do these brows you have fun playing
an eye shadow let me ha ha I'm a oh you
won't want to see my contour color
before you start
oh hi TF hey King cand just this right

there oh oh how did you look at this pan
it's so pretty now I'm gonna use my
other favorite product the beauty killer
pal oh hi oh so I got a lot of tweets
that miss laganja did a little logo
makeup tutorial oh it's right knee is
fucking dope that you did that I love
that people who are doing those you know
I got to be really honest with you I was
so terrified girl everyone's always
asking me to do a makeup - Jen actually
did it - is not my gig you know like I I
love it because you've pushed me in that
way enough I mean honestly before you I
really did my makeup one way like I
literally but you like got me to be
creative and I love your product so much
that it's like fun now and
like enjoy creating yeah being inspired
and trying something new because I
definitely will get stuck in doing the
same type of look
right and then I'm like oh it's been
nine months I think it's time to change
it out exactly want to do something
different so I think I'm just gonna do
something really simple today like I
want to just put that star power right
on my lid and then just kind of you know
keep the rest of it nude and maybe do a
little bit of Courtney in the in the
scene what do you think I love that yeah
come on pink yes pink pink miss pink
pussy all right it's time for the
highlight and what are we oh we have a
little ice cold eye frog skin from
Korres I never leave the house without
it ever I love that Oni it looks amazing
yeah it is my favorite girl it's
blinding you can just see me from outer
space
bro let's talk about the Big D and I
talked about Dallas Texas I'm talking
about Donald fucking Trump girl it's
been a crazy year like America is
fucking insane I think well I mean I
just can't even believe that we have got
a reality TV host running for president
and successfully doing it successfully
doing it I mean it's truly you know
we're kind of a laughingstock I'm not
gonna lie people over in the UK we're
looking at us like we were real crazy oh
and only imagine I haven't been over
there in years but I'm actually gonna be
back in UK end of the month yeah I hope
no one reads me to filth for being an
American well they will and you'll be
fine cuz you know it's just who we are
and we own it right yes but um but no so
I've really been trying to like take to
Twitter and you know I released a
youtube video where I talked about Trump
and all the things that he is talking
about doing like repealing the Marriage
Act or appointing justices rather that
would repeal the Marriage Act which
would directly affect the LGBTQA
community I mean we work so hard to get
the right to marry and then to have that
repeal that which a spot would be
devastating you know disgusting a bear
did happen and that's just one of the
lists of many things right but he's
promoting just you know human right and
look you know I'm not saying Hillary is
perfect either you know being a
politician is very hard and I think
being corrupt and politician they go
hand in hand right but I think we have
to
look at the lesser of two evils and and
really go out to the polls on November
8th and vote it's crazy so if you have a
voice fucking use it because that's what
we're here for
honestly you know that's just my two
cents but um yeah America is turning
crazy it's not that's not crazy already
I'm just scared for our generation in
general and for all the kids that are
gonna come up behind us like it's it's
scary time no it is it is a really big
deal and this is a very important moment
in our history because whatever happens
is going to decide how these kids
futures is going to end up you know and
I think we we've done so much in Forrest
progression I mean people at such a
young age now know what trans is yes you
know and not only do they know what it
is but they're accepting and that to me
is just so huge so to move backward or
to go backwards it's devastating that's
devastating and I don't think that's an
option yeah it isn't an option which is
why we have to use our voices and our
fishy faces Mobile uh-huh and if you
haven't seen laganja's video about
donald trump please head over to her
channel and check it out hashtag drag
queen drags Trump yes ma'am
huh all right so Nathan and you have
concocted a little plan of going
somewhere and they're about to surprise
me and we're where we're going right now
well you know and typical ganja form and
fashion yep we're going to the
dispensary yes are you ready one of my
favorite places in California so we are
gonna go to med men which is this
amazing store in WeHo and baby when I
tell you it is posh posh oh you're not
ready I'm it is high-end high quality
and just a good old height I'm amazing I
can't wait okay and then hot Cheers
ahh cheers to the JSC and waiting for
some lips what are you doing today oh
I'm doing the prom night taking it back
back back again with us and I'm doing a
little Scorpio if you will so you know
after you talked about using the lip
scrub on your entire face uh-huh there's
some followed suit oh yeah if you've
tried it and they're like oh my god it
is she's right in my forehead like crazy
I told you girl that's so cool
multi-purpose so for those of you that
missed it can you please update them on
what
and last time because I almost died and
it was really a genius idea
well basically you know one day when I
was medicated I you know I had the lip
scrub and it was just so it was so taste
and lovely and it was smelling so nice
that I just kind of I just kept taking
it everywhere I'm bitch by the time you
knew it I had a full face mask or your
scrub that is so genius I had to get me
another tube of it cuz you know I went
through it but as a facial scrub mask I
gotta say it worked
uh-huh that's amazing all right so I
think we need a little setting spray
makeup is done of course and we gotta
use our favorite Urban Decay all nighter
makeup setting spray Oh make me wet mama
Mae bam sorry I turned to the exorcist
for a minute oh she's feeling the
fantasy
Jesu wanna fuck please stick to the ribs
yeah you actually think this matters ok
ha ha ha
well girl I think we should go get these
blunts it's ready to roll baby
let's go roll one up and get it I'm
ready
you
you
all right baby we gonna double this
before we depart it's only fitting that
I think we do a little smoke sesh yeah I
think we gotta have to hop off I mean
come on baby
we've never hotbox the Rolls Royce
before so I think it's only fitting that
you're here bitch well baby I am ready
to roll up in this Royce with some pre
rolls okay
yes ma'am and I got the double apple oh
that's one of my favorite act with that
blue cheese the tea bag yes a taker come
through all right
medicinal nothing excessive about this
at all now for those of the viewers
watching around the world I get asked a
lot is it illegal to smoke on camera
people always want to know that whole
gig so we're gonna get a little one too
please
well baby under proposition 215 here in
California we are legal patients so we
are legally allowed to be smoking well
that's really it that's that it's crazy
because other parts of the world try to
make cannabis seem really bad and I'm
like well my whole thing is since you
know I'm against alcohol now that I'm
and not that I'm like I don't care if
anyone else drinks but not for you know
it's not for me and nothing my family is
just full of addicts so I made the
choice to never try alcohol for you
which is wish I had made that decision
because maybe I tried it and tried it
and tried it right and then it tried me
it's mobile yeah yeah now the thing is
is like you know people paid to go to a
bar and get drunk and then right get
psycho assault people act crazy or too
emotional or do you you know people just
so many duis in California it's fucking
I'm not real no yes I have got one and
what you learn from it well I learned
that 80% of people who get a DUI end up
repeating their behavior and I will
admit I did after I went to school I did
6 months of school I paid almost $10,000
I had a breathalyzer in my car and I
still drink and drive again it's an
addiction it really is certainly is
luckily I got the help that I needed and
I'm cool I'm actually five months sober
now I did a whole year last year fell
off the wagon but now five
again so you know it's just all about
picking yourself back up
that's why thank 9% and congratulations
on your five months thank you real um
you know my father passed away from
alcoholism mother was drunk half my
childhood so that's some real shit and I
think a lot of people get you know they
forget that we're all real people right
yes there's hair and wigs and makeup and
all this bullshit but at the end of the
day we all have issues and family
problems and personal demons and we just
got to take a day-by-day
I'm smoke some motherfuckin weed okay
seriously I mean this is such a medicine
for me so I'm so thankful that you know
I have this some people have Prozac they
have kallana pins you know for me I got
the good old cannabis and it works green
you know so Thank You California for
having these these laws now all of us
and November is about to happen so let's
make it a hundred percent legal and
recreational okay it's about time come
on seriously I get so frustrated with
going to bars and getting judged people
are like oh you're not drinking yeah
it's like well I'm having a good time
don't worry I'm like oh do you have a
problem yeah oh you must you're not
drinking in the club right it's bizarre
it is was a good man how great would it
be to be able to just go and have a
joint out on the patio at the club I
would be I would love and we would love
a men well I think on that note let's
take a few more hits yells go thank you
