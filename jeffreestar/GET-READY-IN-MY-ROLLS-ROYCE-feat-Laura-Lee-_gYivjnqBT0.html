okay so I'm putting whiskers on my lash
line and in my crease and I'm love being
it I am putting hissy fit on my eyelid
you better work or Sam I'll work that
little hiss bit okay so growing up how
are you so open minded and great I never
fix is a weird question
oh not a weird question is a good
question because I just want to say that
growing up in the South it's not a very
diverse area and everybody's very
sheltered to the rest of the world I
feel like it's kind of closed off yeah
and how did you blossom from there I did
and you know what I I noticed that about
myself I'm like I am different you know
yeah people because um even growing up
like all my friends were just either
white or black
I don't know and everybody was straight
that was just it there's just a culture
you know and I moved to California
didn't even know this many cultures live
in our country and I know that sounds so
ignorant it's not okay that's where
you're from where I'm from I live there
for 25 years I just didn't know I think
that's so cool that you're just so
candid and honest yeah cuz a lot of
people don't realize that but you know
what I have found
people are scared of something that's so
different from them yes it scares them
whether it's sexuality or anything
sexuality culture the way people look
the color of their skin it's carosone
it's different yes which is so sick so
sad and you know what I I met like you I
met I think Patrick Starr was one of the
first I've never really seen like a
full-on drag before I had it oh my gosh
yeah well there's no crazy drag shows
where you live yeah we met so I just
never guys in makeup we're not obviously
if they in your city not at all so I see
Patrick at this event and I was like oh
my god this creature is so beautiful I
want to take it that's so kind of like
Marley oh my god did you yeah that's so
sick yes and like I see you I'm like oh
it's so pretty I want to take it rather
than run from it yes people look at
things either A or B they don't want to
run for it oh they want to embrace it
and make it theirs that's so cool that
your brain is like embrace it baby and
the people here are dreamers like they
just are dreamers like you meet someone
here they want to be an actor they want
to invent something with everyone you me
they may be working at a restaurant or
be your uber driver but they're always
working on something bigger and Kelvin
you don't worry in Los Angeles I know
and there's so many dreamers and there's
so many inspiring people out here yeah
yeah agreed
that's so cool so what made you take the
plunge to move out here okay so let me
tell you're going to think
funny I never asked you this I'm dying
to know this is a good story
so I was in Alabama people YouTube isn't
what it is out here as it is in Alabama
it's a bit smaller in Alabama and I was
just so into makeup I loved Mac Mac Mac
Mac Mac Mac did you ever before uh no I
couldn't get a job there
why I wasn't good look at her now McBain
yeah that was my first job mat counter
crazy but hey I wasn't good I am in it
like I'm not stupid like I know I wasn't
good at it so I didn't get a job there
you know it would be like and I was so C
I would be so scared in elegant but I
usually really shy too and everyone's
like rolling their eyes but yeah but
we're not all born like it's like a I
mean the Boy Scouts have no like side
part lie to me more like knee-high socks
yeah you never know what life may take
you ever that that's a huge thing like
Thank You somewhere crazy and how cool
that you asked Patrick for a picture
yeah like two years ago now you guys are
neighbor no I think it's so
killer it's just so inspiring
it's like we're such good friends no I
think it's so awesome isn't that amazing
and like never underestimate yourself
I'll tell you that but never
underestimate yourself you're gonna have
an open mind and like an open heart just
like a free spirit that's she just said
a mouthful y'all that's so cool this
eyeshadow Alabama down here smoked out

feeling like runway chic like better or
that okay so Laura I never curl my
lashes and people read me to fill so I
just don't really nothing I don't need
to I just really don't need to okay but
I'm trying everybody in the car so if
