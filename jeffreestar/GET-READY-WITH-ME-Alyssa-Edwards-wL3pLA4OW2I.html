that was my thing I was never in like
the gay scene or the drag world I was
like over here with all the tattooed
rockers in the fuckin so this is like
two worlds United yeah I did I love it I
think it's so cool
we're gonna buff out my coins for y'all
but just think I'm not gonna blend that
harsh line out you got the wrong one but
you got that Kat Von D I have that too
Oh
this contour palette is heaven love come
through contour what do you think is a
most important part of the face cream
that's a good question I was thinking
about getting covering come later what
oh shit shit I couldn't cut work huh so
not just you know not just a tap but my
favorite part of the make up is I just
love eyes and lips like I love changing
the shape of my eye
I love smokey I just I love maybe you
can help me with my lips Tim because I
feel like that's my leagues I'm always
down to help you you're the first person
I've seen the minute to have Shivering
wait yes it can be proud okay so I'm at
the contour the nose with this little
guy I want love that an oppression eye
dies by this brand called artiste
I live it puts that nose on there and
then you got to blend it out cuz it's
extreme I'm trying to chisel this
fucking nose you got a goal you want to
get it done I'm from Texas you either go
big or just stay at the health care
exactly alright now when I do my brows I
hold my breath so give a moment of
silence for these you know I'm a
southern lady strong in my faith and I
need to say a little prayer for you girl
I don't mind I really would appreciate
that
okay sure have any father please watch
over this gently as she basically puts
on the most important part the face the
brow hold her hand be a limit or repeat
light unto my path
have people ever asked you this did you
ever want to be a girl I used to get
asked all the time of my music career or
what do i what do I call you and you
just were yourself you don't Jeffrey I
don't see you as a man and I don't see
you as a woman what about like an alien
I see you as an angel
oh that's help thank you
you didn't see yourself as a woman or
man did you I just saw me as Jeffrey and
people didn't like that answer because
we live in a society where ever needs to
be labeled yeah let me trip you out even
more I love men yes but I don't mind
dabbling in the winter makeup or
gaveling into oh the vagina not the
makeup once in a while no I had sex with
a woman too
I'm down I'm down for women sometimes do
I wake up every day thinking about well
it's it you know it's it's how can I
wear this to be politically correct oh
this ain't a pageant girl fucking right
ah it's a little easier to have sex on
the woman you just kind of know the role
do you know with you're with another man
you gotta say are you who's gonna do
what right how we gonna do this you know
I gotta organize it right and then you
know we call each other she all the time
and that's our oh she's a girl here and
that's our terminology but for normal
people that are only they're just
introduced to that type of terminology I
get asked all the time
twinkle you a boy or a girl what do you
say you call me whatever you want to
call me my voice is G right I am NOT a
real female nor am I trying to be but
it's calming if you want he/she alien
angel just don't say it or you're gonna
get maced shot thank you
let me trip them out even more my
boyfriend is straight but then
everyone's gonna be like well he's
having sex with you obviously he's not
straight well there's a big gray area
out there you can basically be only into
chicks and then find someone that's
androgynous or beautiful and just have a
connection do you agree on that because
that's love attraction love is love but
people get get it twisted well if he had
sex with being gay well no he's only had
sex with women and then he's had sex
with me so what does that mean
do you have lovely sex amen okay so I'm
just buffing out this purple and I'm
actually mixing
and I'm using this busy art palette I
mean hi it's like Rainbow Brite love it
I'm obsessed this formula blends so
beautifully it's like oh I love that
we're both having a little purple and oh
yeah we're having a fantasy moment oh
yes
why do I love yellow and purple together
like do I look like the Lakers or is
acceptable well I thought I'm gonna do a
little bit more black and red since I'm
being in a queen of hearts now with the
colored palpable

moment of silence okay so you need your
own moment of silence oh girl
