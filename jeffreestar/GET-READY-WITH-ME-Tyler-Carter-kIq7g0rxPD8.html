channel today I brought my best friend
with me although I'm having so much fun
your house this is Tyler and we've been
friends for a long time mom yeah at
least five years okay we actually met a
long time ago because Tyler he does
music if you guys have never heard him
before pause the video and go play all
of his music he thinks um we met at one
of his shows and we've just been friends
ever since we toured Warped Tour
together and shared a bus when I was
doing my clothing line um and we've been
we've been through a lot of crazy
adventures we've been through a lot of
ups and downs but the biggest up is that
has taken me five years to let Jeffrey
transform me into something glamorous
right so until today's the fucking day
bitch alright so the usual get ready is
a string or makeup together Tyler does
not normally wear makeup on a daily
basis so we're just gonna hang out chill
and I'm gonna give him a little
androgyny glam rock type look so for
this video I'm actually gonna have Tyler
shave off this amazing beard so everyone
say a quick style and prayer for the
beard cool thank you now we're gonna go
shave moisturize and prep them
motherfucking face we'll see you in a
second so now I'm back with the fetus
face so we can start all over so now
that he's a baby face I think the most
important thing is skin care and Tyler
actually takes pretty good care of his
skin now when you tour the world and
travel a lot it's harsh unders it's been
a it's been a rough year but I quit
drinking last June I've got myself to
champagne and that's it taking great
care of myself so I'm all about
preventative moisturizer so my favorite
is the lemare softening cream now Tyler
is like what the hell is this this
moisturizer is very pricey but is the
best of
best Oh we're gonna take a damp Beauty
Blender and we're just gonna moisturize
and I'm just gonna dab this all over and
then blend it in and I was like God is
just like blowing sweetly on my skin it
was no nice it was cooking away
okay so we're more stressed he's he's
glistening now we're gonna put on some
androgyny foundation now what do I mean
by that the Geoffrey cocktail so we're
gonna take this Make Up For Ever HD
stick and we're just gonna add some
around.they you now I've seen a lot of
people cover up beards with orange
concealer I think if you've grown enough
foundation you don't do that but we're
gonna try it out and I'm gonna be using
that do your air flash is my go-to
secret a cocktail so we're just gonna
we're gonna spray her good clean oh my
god oh my love guiding through this pain
never minds me we used to huffing okay
so before this foundation dries we are
going to be blending out now you all
know how to do it with the Beauty
Blender you're just gonna take it and
blend and blend until the skin looks
like a mannequin
now we're doing a full coverage look
today so this which is okay because
girls in my scene they like guys who
look like vampires so this worked
perfect it works perfect so now I
definitely am gonna use some brightening
concealer I'm loving the Urban Decay
Naked skin all right so we're gonna do a
lot of brightening today hi
yeah look at her she's highlighted and
then we're gonna use the same Beauty
Blender and we're just gonna blend are
you reshaping my nails yeah that's
happening yeah oh I'm gonna like him
when I was like four years old I used to
wear a long t-shirt and a t-shirt on my
head pulled back with a rubber band and
I used to call myself Carla
no you didn't swear yo I gotta show you
home videos sometime I used to care I
used to pull my grandmother's purse
around with one end of the strap off her
and I used to call it my pet pig no
swear okay now because his shirt is
lower I do like to cover the neck a
little and put little foundations of
blends
now we're gonna contour no Tyler as
contoured before I've contoured him for
some AG account like videos
yeah and I'll and videos um and he does
like that effect so I'm definitely going
to amp it up alright for contour I'm
going to be using two items today I'm
gonna be using the Laura Mercier contour
book which is a cream contour and then
I'm gonna be going over it with the Kat
Von D shade + light to really prevent in
black paths so let's give this fish some
cheekbones oh I want to look like Joan
Rivers grandson okay perfect so you want
to look like me we're gonna go around
the beanie y'all now we're gonna cut out
that jaw now for the nose I'm gonna be
kind of conservative but still give him
a look because that's why we're here
now we're gonna choose the same Beauty
Blender and we gotta pop it Oh
all right come through Fabio now I'm
going to take some Mac Studio Fix and
I'm going to place it around the entire
face don't get there Renee I was
literally thinking that I know why I can
help it now how do you like me now yeah
now you never want the under eyes to
look cakey so if you have any creasing
life you've just smoked a bowl of meth
on episode of cops you definitely want
to tone down the concealer now we're
going to be taking this crack cocaine
Mac Studio Fix powder for highlighting
and I love using a wet because the
powder literally blends into the skin
alright enough to crack back to
contouring now we're gonna take the Kat
Von D shade and light palette and since
we're basically the same skin tone I'm
gonna be using mine that is almost at
the pan because this formula hmm and
we're just gonna use this Make Up For
Ever fan brush and just chisel out from
cheeks ooh
this that chin is chose gold holiday
look at that hey Barbie honey
we can contour my boobs too if you
really want that OC look you gotta add
contour to your cheek you now Tyler has
really bold amazing brows I always have
loved his brows they're very defined and
they really shape his whole existence
have a tumblr called Tyler Carter's
eyebrows no yeah okay well I'm gonna be
subscribing to that leaner brows I'm
really gonna stay away from it I think
they're bold and amazing so for eyes I
want to do a really smoky glam look so
I'm gonna be using that morphe 35 P
today I love this morning good morning
these on this side I'm gonna be using
the this family cuz I live now we're
gonna start with the eyes because I do
not want any crumbling or fall out I'm
gonna put powder under his eyes which
we've all heard about baking by now okay
look uh let's just loose powder that's
gonna sit there and bake under your skin
while I do the eyes so if there's any
loose fall out or like crumbles it gets
in the powder all right so just start
the eyeshadow I'm gonna be using the Kat
Von D high-voltage eye primer we want
these shadows to stick girl so look down
and we're just gonna put a little bit on
each eye and then blend that all over
now the primer is down I'm gonna take
the lightest shade in this 35p which is
up here we're just gonna dab into her
and then we're gonna just cover a whole
lid I really loving all those purple
shadows in this palette I definitely
want to utilize them so we go new date
shoot it shoot it we won't fucking do it
ah now we're just gonna add some purple
right away oh yes looks like Prince's
like penis when I first started out now
all this the fallout you guys see which
is exactly why we put down that loose
so is gonna be our saving grace later oh
no now I'm gonna be doing a light
lavender metallic shimmer of course
we're gonna wet the brush with the
trusty mix plus yes so now we're just
gonna place this shadow directly on here
does it feel a little cooling does it
feel like when it's really metallic of
course we're not done blending it's all
you shaking get your bitter chill out
and we're just gonna buff her out now
the reason why I'm using my fingers you
guys I'm just pressing more pigment
pilot lids just sent me a text and they
were not purple enough now we're just
blending and buffing I'm bringing a
lighter mob color all the way to the
brow so it's like full drama with a
shimmer room ah we're gonna brush out
all that fallout we're just gonna brush
it away now if anything ever gets on the
skin like a little bit on the nose you
can take your damp Beauty Blender and
just carefully wipe it away all right
now I'm going to be adding in some
shimmer this is the Stila metallic
violet this has really dope glitter so
before I do the under eye I'm just gonna
Pat some on and this one actually works
best when you apply it with your finger
I'm just gonna place it in the center of
his lid just gives you a really nice
glitter effect
I didn't see you there of course I did I
just wasn't calling you all right now
before I do any shadow on his under-eye
I'm gonna do some white liner now y'all
know Mac fascinating pencil is my
favorite so let's see if your eyes water
if they do we'll just mace you let's see
if you can be a mobile liner y'all ah
almost done okay like up anything that a
little bit more for dimension okay under
eye I'm gonna be taking the same hot
purples and just blending it out and -
you know all right
the eyes are almost done now I've ever
worn fake lashes before ever
oh Jesus take total okay well let's do
mascara first I know we've done mascara
on before now my knees the benefit
roller lash today I'm obsessed with this
this was like a flashlight six bitch

god is real lashes are so pretty now I'm
sure some of you were like why don't you

thing oh yeah look at my bottoms oh

after you you know many times I'd watch
mrs. Doubtfire prob like a hundred my
favorite part is when he puts his face
in the cake and goes oh but anxious name
okay brace yourself alright now here's
my favorite part of doing makeup is the
highlight you guys know I like to glow
like sixty angels in church and you know
it's Tyler's here we got to bring the
globe so I'm gonna pull out my
Jacqueline Hill Becca
and we're gonna mix champagne pop with
pearl so we're just gonna dab into this
guy and this one and I like to merge
them together highlighting is my
favorite thing to do and we're just
gonna put this right on the on top of
that contour remember when the brush is
wet too be careful that you still want
it to blend beautifully why look at that
glow bitch oh okay now I like to put
some above the Cupid's bow see my mouth
has a little bliss inning we're just
gonna shimmy this on you now we're gonna
do a little bit on the bridge of the
nose for a fact now for a lipstick we
could literally do any color with this
look purple is cool it's very versatile
you can do nude black red really
anything you want Tyler is going on tour
soon with his band and I gave him a
bunch of liquid lipsticks and you
actually told me that dirty money
celebrity skin and drug lord was your
favorite dirty money just looks so rock
star it's different huh like I think any
straight guy any buy guy any whatever
like could use dirty money so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna put on dirty money
first I will dab a little drug board and
see what happens
girl
all right now we're gonna add in a
little bit of druglord on the center
we're just gonna dab a little bit here
and the cool thing is you can um brave
ease by just taking your clean finger
open your mouth off and just patting
this on really creates a cool effect
there we go girl yes
this look is almost complete and we're
gonna be using the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray to really lock in
that makeup close your eyes and hold
your breath and we're just going to set
this makeup I just will do me while
we're sitting here hmm
and now that the setting spray is
complete this look is done alright guys

feel that makeup on most people like see
guys and like rockers and people from
like our scene I'm doing more with like
reds or relax um and just more no very
my Chemical Romance I wanted to give you
the full glam different color like your
eyes are so pretty I thought purples
would be really cool and it's different
everyone does the same black gray
makeups fun you know I think nowadays so
many people are being more accepting you
don't have to be gay to wear makeup.you
anyone can wear makeup I mean people
back in the day that were straight were
wearing makeup and then somehow we got
in this weird lull in the 90s in the
early 2000s where people just became so
much more judgmental but I think you
look fucking beat girl I beat that face
mega was an art form just like making
music just like acting in a movie um and
you can play different roles it's not
like you're gonna start wearing this
look every day this is just for fun and
the cool thing about makeup is it wipes
off it's not that serious this is just
fine this is not the Carter future it's
just um it's just our baby if you want
