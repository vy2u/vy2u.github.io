is only one school in California that
teaches you how to become a mortuary
petition no I swear to God I was waiting
makeup on dead people are you living I'm
more than a gang or both hi
so my philosophy when I was 18 was oh my
god like I really wanted to do it and it
was so cool because your clients can't
talk back yeah hi I was going to apply I
was like about to do it and then the
internet happened and then
I never went and I started doing music
and makeup and doing gigs and you know
just freelancing and then I'd freelanced
at Matt cuz I was like oh I can't stay
at one yeah I freelance using bitches
drive you know that happen to me I feel
inside I was never permanent yeah it's
crazy cuz with me I was trying to become
permanent hi comment things more y'all
Casey didn't know yes it does it totally
does an interviewed for it and I was
like in the process of the interview for
it to become permanent did not end I'm
not getting it like at all
I'm like okay cool like whatever I can
I'm a loser it's fine I was like okay
whatever like I guess I'll just like
start to Instagram with you oh hi hi and
the cool thing is when I first saw you I
was like okay well it takes courage
first of all of yourself and live your
life online and just show everything
little people what you're doing guys and
just show your art like that takes
people may think because we've been
doing this for a while now like with our
oh right now it takes Carillo it does
every today to show yourself do you have
like any spots on your face that don't
take makeup where where is it for me
it's or right here there's a spot like
it will always make my bronzer look
patchy in this area like it will
it doesn't take pigment isn't that real
you're just take it I base a lot of
people home they're like girl meet you
because it happen happens if you guys if
you like I've had that happen to comment
but down below where you're not is
victorious I'm so bronzy I'm like look
at my little come here do you like we
started the same color high and now I'm
albino okay you know what's crazy about
me I only contour my nose a powder i
won't i won't do the cream I like it
doing what I like doing without her only
to mmm-hmm
okay where's my nose at find her okay
put this horror okay
yeah I feel like I'm trying to see so
many more boys in the BBC now a lot like
Ivy I see if like I've seen I'm trying
to see like so many more boys in the
beat to me it's amazing to see that like
they're truly like feeling confident
enough to be in social media where to
Olivia when they may use anything it's
it's crazy I feel like when I first
started putting on makeup
it was so anti guy and I'm like yeah ok
what about like Matt man Sam
George and like Freddie Mercury and all
these people but then there was like a
big low we're like Jews and mega we're
just not I wasn't a thing there wasn't a
thing it was nothing and like it was
like society was very much against it
it's crazy
ok so what's in the mani love department
Oh about that life I mean like for seven
years until Nate did not want to date
anyone I was focused on my career on one
diet and it's hard to find someone
that's first of all not crazy
mm-hm so that's my that's already number
one take me a long time for that and
it's yeah it's hard to find anybody
that's legit these days like 110 Grady
like honestly like I'm so focused on my
career I'm so focused on myself and
that's like weird to say it's like I
focus on me but it's the truth
no it's I'm really not I'm like if you
want to be successful you have to focus
on you you have like you and I just not
about being selfish it's about what
reason I need like last charter I leave
the house much I'm like I I need to make
this brand what I wanted to be and I
cannot be going out to club
honest you know like even if I was being
selfish like I don't even care like I
want to be selfish and like love myself
