kwang-ho stood on Nicky on their
Instagram and I was like this bitch I'm
sickening I mean that's fucking awesome
it's such an icon think I think I bought
this when I saw miss fame using actually
yes I was like oh if you like it then I
can't talk about the fact that she got
signed to IMG Paris yes the first what a
drag queen should be signed to a model
contract you're killing evil orange and
he just did a laurio campaign I saw that

good show
I know oh hey guess what rumor has it
it's coming back that's why you're -
yeah Michael see how I'm doing shit
since then and when you play carrot now
I don't really mean that I think he's
sickening but when do you play a
character for eight years it's really I
don't have to go outside and go to the
grocery store without everyone telling
you they like your show and Dexter is
their fucking favorite thing on earth
and it's hard to get cast as something
oh it is because you only see like it's
like Aaron Paul from Breaking Bad that's
it I only see a hot meth addict every
time I see him in a movie Vicki would
you ever move here for real oh you
thought about it me like half half yeah
not not like or he's gonna summer home
I think you'll be so great if you lift
your Nicky so yeah but somebody

what about selling isn't lipstick
surfacing your own reading I'm bored
well you though into pro Hewitt I I said

reason like that was like my actually
like most like commenting was like you
mispronounce that uh-huh

can't pronounce the name I just put it
on the screen and might have a moment
here so most are doing every French
brand like I'm like I can't do it okay
just please teach me your way I promise
like I thought I said it right cousin
have they got Spanish toyomi mmm-hmm you
do have that look if I say something
especially against I'm pretty Mexican
oh it sounds flawless you know
it's hard to find a legit yeah person
these days that isn't crazy or caddy or
maybe with me yes and just people in
general like it's rough to find friends
like obviously I know 100 percent
because people are crazy they are it's
our community itself sometimes people
can be so competitive and so weird
it's bizarre well what I find to be
weird is that especially lately there's
been a lot of non negativity but like
everything is like being so very nice
yeah everything every word every little
thing we spit into something negative
yes every thought or snap is turn into
like a news story or like a thing like
it's though it's so weird though I know
why is it like that I don't know I was
like I feel like now that I'm really
immersed into you too but you guys are
veterans compared to me so I'm like okay
I'm really just getting my feet wet
right and some people are really crazy
the vision there is vicious
you know what are you guys I handle a
whatever you're like bring me the most
is that I started my channel with eight
years ago now yeah
and from 8 from year one to seven it's
always been so positive in like my
community has been so amazing and
uplifting and we all learn from each
other right and especially this air yeah
it is vicious and darkness and negative
so and especially since I've been here
for so long yeah yeah it breaks my heart
it honestly does yeah and I'm over here
like she's just got an engine like Oh
everyone's cuckoo
yeah no he's like it wasn't like this I
promise I'm like it was not like that
because that's why everyone is so
excited Oh YouTube that's what everyone
these are to the cert time your makeup
yes and to enjoy are all are like love
for makeup and have fun and inspire each
other
yeah there's any advice I can give to
beginning your - yes yeah please please
ignore the hate
really is ignore like negativity please
just be there
enjoy your craft enjoy your art and and
don't give a shit about anything else
and honestly be there like because you
want to be there for that your craft
right
don't start YouTube like the wrong
reasons I like the habits a lot nowadays
it's like oh I try to go my own boss and
I'm gonna come out with my own money and
just like killed it it's like oh people
that so great but like you're not really
doing it for like the wrong reasons
right and maybe you will be successful
maybe you won't but and don't forget it
took me seven years yes right that'd be
5% yeah totally yeah no you're killing
it so it's like it's a cool like thumb
was like one of those like hundred dogs
to set success stories because like it's
amazing like you kept going you would
kept persevering yeah you don't really
get it let you don't like going is
because I love what I do
exactly I love makeup I love what it
does I love it a chance for him and if I
went in it for money or for fame or for
whatever reason you wouldn't last that
long
no I agreed I'm you know like people
think that like they're gonna go in and
they're just gonna fucking slit
automatically and that it's really easy
it's hard work so hard yeah really and
then the cool thing about this like I
feel like us three like we're all such a
different people who work you're
combining with each other and like we're
Koreans video now we're showing unity
and it's like yeah that we actually do
love each other I think you community
it's more love like and support yeah I
agree I want to see more collabs and
more I think unity is actually the
perfect word for it is the perfect word
it's worth Emanuel don't but that's a
lot people don't want yous excited yeah
and I don't want people to think we're
saying this like ohoo us over party but
it's generally yeah it's just something
I've noticed and I'm not really loving
it we're just really spilling tea and
we're literally telling the truth
yeah this is the truth at the point is
it's not like woe is us like our lives
are so rough of course and there's no
like what it is I was gonna take it that
way though that's fine we can't change
that we can change that I mean that's
your thought please anyone
