channel today I am with my doctor my
dermatologist dr. Kirby nice to see you
hi how many years have I known you I
think like seven or eight I spent a long
time now which every star one of my
favorite patients so I'm honored to be s
we met a long time ago because I had a
thick beard and back in the day it was
ruining my makeup so I first came for
hair removal the beards gone then we
went to tattoos tattoos gone redone and
now we're back for the lives now you
guys know I'm all about changing your
appearance if you want to do it don't do
it for anyone else but yourself
and we've been doing lip injections for
like six years but a while yeah now
people think that they're permanent so
let's break down a few myths I'm glad
you brought that up so when we talk
about lip augmentation at one end of the
spectrum are things that are very very
temporary yeah favorite substance uses
old fashioned collagen yeah and it's
really soft it's really kissable it's
really smooth the only problem is it
lasts about six weeks yeah the other in
spectrum are permanent fillers silicone
there's there's other branded permanent
fillers and I don't recommend those but
correct even if you love it at the time
your face is going to change over time
yeah and then and you're gonna be stuck
with that because as the names yes
they're permanent yeah so you don't want
that you don't want that so very
temporary very permanent what do we find
ourselves a happy place in the middle
yeah it's Halle uronic acid based
fillers Juvederm bullet arrow and
Restylane or the most common and we're
doing Juvederm today and the last time I
did it was like a year ago so my lips
are getting smaller and they're ready
for a revision so I'm noticing the
bottoms gotten smaller and then the top
system didn't see how it's really small
in there when we look at lips one of the
most important things is symmetry and
your lips are very symmetrical which is
great thank you also want twice the
volume in the lower lip as in the upper
lip one of the biggest mistakes that
occurs during lip augmentation it was at
the top too much thank you
and then the bottom looks smaller than
the top so crazy and I'm like whoa
slowed-down 100% correct so we want more
volume in the bottom and then also you
have great nasal columns which are these
two things here if you don't have great
nasal columns it it's very odd
it looks very awkward and that's like
the ducky look everyone correct
if you don't rebuild the anatomic orders
and you don't have nasal columns it look
strange so we want to really put an
emphasis in the lower lip on the middle
symmetrical portion of the lip and also
augment the nasal column just a little
bit I'm ready so we're gonna just numb
me up and we'll be back momentarily oh
hi this numbing looks a little
interesting now I know you watching can
make a lot of sexual jokes out there
tone it down and relax I have a high
pain tolerance everyone at my old body
tattoo had three c-sections so a couple
little pinches here so I'm ask you just
to stay forward like this and you can
just relax completely little pinch on
three curl your toes one two three
little pinch I can tell I'm in the
perfect area wrong million border great
that's the first little pinch not
terrible right now okay tell me if it
hurts you
all right well sorry about that never
let me remind you every time we inject
it's more comfortable because and you
get more in you go at all I can tell I'm
in the perfect place because I have the
ability to lift up the needle so I want
to be at the anatomical boundary between
the regular skin and mucosa skin because
I want to augment the Vermilion border
on the mucosal side what does that mean
for you it just mean to you of emeriti
dermatologist who has done this a couple
times alright listen I heard about at
all with nice great it's a quick little
massage so we do a little pinch
underneath here on three we do three
little pinch sorry about that
perfect our kids are comfortable yeah so
going pinch right in the middle on three
one two three little pinch I'm in the
perfect place
one two three we're just awed menteng
what Mother Nature gave you so bright my
top very easy simple upgrade the word
doctor is from the word doctorate which
means to teach so I always tell people
being a physician as being an educator
and that's why I love doing stuff like
this because it allows me to educate the
public and people who would never
normally know
sort of how anaesthetic dermatologist
practices this opens up me to their
world and vice versa so what we've done
so far is we have augmented different
million border from the living border
the lip is the side that that demarcates
a normal skin from the mucosa side so by
slightly rolling and augmenting this
mucosal side we give a really sexy
naughty pout to the lips and of course
it's exaggerated now because of the
actual injection but you can see this
entire line is augmented underneath is
augmented and the nasal column so the
hardest part is done and the swelling
that Geoffrey is experiencing is a
hundred percent normal at this point now
we're going to go a little bit deeper
with these next pinches one two three
little pinch and every single
dermatologist has their own way of doing
the fermentation I really like to walk
backwards and forwards and sort of
respect my work as I go on I think that
finding a dermatologist is just like a
tattoo artist it's really important to
find the right person there are million
people nowadays injecting and doing all
this stuff but go to the right person
just like a tattoo I've seen so many bad
lips are bad with anything do your
research people well there's certainly
no a good dermatologist is going to
bring you and explain what he or she
does and then let you make the ultimate
decision ya have to make sure that just
like anything in life you want to be on
the same page with that person in that
clear so now we did the hardest job now
we're going to do the easier pieces one
two three the swelling we can expect it
to go down considerably in the next
couple hours but over the course of the
next week we need a lot of positive
swelling and resolution of the negative
swelling and then one of the other
things when we do great lip
augmentations you have to remember the
lips are 3d object they're not a 2d
object and so as a result one of the
things that I like to do a technique I
like to incorporate is an intraoral
injection so we pull the lip down this
is a mucosal injection little pinch one
two three so who has the most phenomenal
lips that you can think of what Angelina
Jolie why is that she's a really natural
flair to her lips
so her teeth are flared out and as a
result of constant lips to flare out
when the lips flare out the human eye
associates that was sexiness and since
we've met I've gotten all my teeth done
so when we first did it my teeth were
more sunk into my face and now that
they're more pushed out I think the lips
look even better absolutely and the lips
are sort of like the curtains to the
teeth you know
think it goes like a window the curtains
really augment that window
we're almost done this is a little pinch
it hurts 1 2 3 I mean guys water a
little now it hurts a lot
don't move we're still waterproof
mascara whoo
very good so bleeding and bruising 100%
normal
you should always have some level of
both and if you're not then the then the
person doing the procedure is not
getting to the right anatomical level or
as you know the lips are very vascular
there should be blood involved you don't
want to be gushing blood I save token 1
2 3 if you don't have a vascular
component to what you're doing you're
simply not in the right place
anatomically so we're actually done with
augmentation you know I'm just cleaning
you up a little bit of hydrogen peroxide
a little bit of alcohol and what's
really important now is what you do when
you leave here and I tell people half of
lip augmentation is what I do and half
of it is what you do when you leave here
so what do I want to do I want pinch
here pinch here make a little taco there
like this hold in the middle I want to
do intraoral manipulation lips so any
little nodules we want to smooth out
more you massage it the better you're
going to do average person doesn't heal
themselves correctly I think with a lot
of stuff whether it's surgery or
anything they get it and like alright
I'm done it's like you have to take care
of it going to look good 100% this is a
partnership and I don't want you and
what you do here when you leave the
clinic is up to you yeah we'll give you
really specific instructions but if you
don't follow them there's nothing I can
do about that so anyone getting lip
augmentation used to make sure that
they're committed to the process and
they need to make sure that they have
great aftercare instructions when they
go home nine ten percent now I've
noticed a lot of people when they
comment on someone that has done lip
injections there's so many like myths
yes where did the Botox in the mouth
rumor start people Botox is for well
that were wrinkles and it's for others
things but you don't put Botox in your
mouth correct
Botox is a neurotoxin so it prevents
muscle movement and I think people just
associate any injection with Botox with
videos they lump it in the same category
Oh Mike that's not so my thing it's very
very normal that the lips are going to
be dry after this just because of the
amount of manipulation we did to them
but yet we prodded we messed with them
so this is just plain old-fashioned
Vaseline my favorite moisturizer for the
lips after a procedure like this and we
just want to put it on
there put a nice thick coat so the lips
does nothing other than help with the
dryness the hearing to expect to
experience and then also let me remind
you what you see right now is very very
swollen and asymmetrical and that's
completely normal
yeah any asymmetry you see you should
you can massage out yourself and over
the course of the next week which is
probably when you'll do this follow-up
video you'll see the final resist some
practitioners will say don't massage the
Juvederm or a rest one because it's
where where we one we're at the eighth
to be right I disagree with that
wholeheartedly
once again this goes back to the mantra
of looking in the mirror and massaging
and the way you want them to look
because you have the ability to
manipulate them alright
so five minutes out of every hour for
the rest of today is your job - yep -
massage them questions for me I think
I'm a veteran we've been doing this a
long time so I'm question for you today
you're going to great massage massage
massage call me with any questions um
I'd love to get a picture a week and see
how they look perfect thank you so much
thank you let's thank you all right guys
I am really numbed up at swelling so I
will see you shortly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
