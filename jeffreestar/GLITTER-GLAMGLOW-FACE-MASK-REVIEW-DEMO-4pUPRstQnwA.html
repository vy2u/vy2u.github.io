my channel today Jaden's not wearing a
bra me neither
I never do I'm celebrating the Union
Jack and I'm just living for the UK
right now I want to go back okay so
today we're gonna try out some crazy
skincare yeah
now the glam glow glitter mask has hit
Instagram its hit the internet and there
are so many questions people are like it
personally excited me and got me off
because I'm a sparkle whore when you saw
this for the first time what did you
think I thought it was pretty cool I was
like they got stars in it it's got your
name written all over it
exactly yeah so today we are going to be
reviewing this glam glow glitter mask it
is part of the gravity mud firming
treatment entourage by now you know they
have the classic silver we actually
reviewed the blue one with mani yes like
a year ago yeah
which sold out everywhere in Sephora and
now they have the Power Rangers version
and now here is the highly anticipated
glitter version which I can't wait to
put on my face and see what it looks
like it's I'm ready to see what's going
on I'm excited besides all that we have
the family collection coming out on the
21st
BAM of October yeah it's like really
close it's go away you guys I'm fucking
shook to the ground so me and Nathan of
course have a collection out if you have
been sleeping or we haven't been online
check back on my channel a few videos
back we revealed the whole thing we did
swatches yes we can and we are really
really excited for this collection
alright let's dive into this review
alright so me and Nathan really love the
glam glow gravity firming treatment I
know most of you have seen this it
literally has 40,000 hearts on Sephora
calm I was just clicking it for the
information I was like oh this glitter
one let's open her up so here is the
beautiful unit carton it is shiny and
vallini now this will be launching I
think the second week of December around
December 13th and it will be on Sephora
calm and I think the app and of course
also on Glenn
official website so this is gonna be fun
for the holidays now this mask is
allegedly going to firm lift tight tone
and give us sexy contours for our skin
okay I'm down for $69 which is what this
retails for you get the full size of 1.7
ounces which that's pretty good and that
size it is the same size so let's open
her up you get of course the brush BAM
which I love because if you don't have a
face master brush you always get a brand
new one with the brand and then here is
the jar so let's pull her out so and
it's silver it's gonna matte finish
that's sick
I like the blackened look so very nice
there is that okay so the glitter used
in this mask is cosmetic face grade
makeup meaning the glitter that you
would put on your eyes or anything like
that so it is very safe for the skin a
lot of people thought from seeing the ad
because they did glitter on the models
shoulder people thought that there was
actual glitter going to fall out of the
mask onto your body but I mean I guess
if you've never played or seen like that
yeah you would maybe assume that so of
course we're gonna zoom in and show you
guys and even right here you can see
that this is encapsulated so the glitter
is not coming out anywhere is literally
in a gel encapsulated you are not gonna
feel it you're not gonna really have any
moments with the glitter it's just gonna
look really cool for selfies and
Instagram so other key things that I
think are very important to know about
this is that the glitter is not gonna
clog your pores there is no really leave
behind with these masks of course you'll
get a few spots here and there but once
you put it on this is a dry down mask
dries just like the other ones they are
going to peel off completely so a lot of
questions I saw on Twitter today were is
the glitter going to ruin the
environment okay let's talk about that
for a minute a lot of people were like
well what if it goes down the drain and
in the water this is a peel-off mask
ellipsis so what are we gonna do after
the mask is done you throw it away you
know in the trap down yes you don't
flush it down the toilet you don't throw
it down the sink you literally peel it
off wave it around right
and throw in the garbage bin exact so
there's that question it is not going to
scratch your face and a lot of people
were like why do they put glitter with
the skincare girl its 2017 all right
somebody I'm buying exactly that's
exactly what they're trying to do here
yeah I'm just trying to have fun with
everything it's like a sparkle trend
right now I feel like so yeah I think
that everyone has a different type of
brand and if you want really serious
skincare then there's definitely Yan for
you but if you're more into fun and fun
miss we keep saying fun then this brand
is for you so I think obviously you guys
are waiting for us to shut our mouths
and apply it and see what happens
all right I do want to read what we're
supposed to do with this okay so stir
before use if required apply a generous
even layer to clean skin where are our
faces are clean we're going to avoid our
eyebrows under eye area and hairline
we're gonna leave on for about 30
minutes and of course we're gonna gently
peel up and rinse excess off or I just
take a makeup wipe if there's any little
residue yeah so I'm about 15 minutes
more than the normal mud mask exactly so
yeah besides that you guys I think we
should dive into it let's do this let's
apply oh right let's get physical'
they're on our faces
alright so we're into a quick little
stir and of course you guys can see on
the zoom in everything is encapsulated
cuz I have that same question too I'm
like is that what's gonna happen with
the glitter so let's take one scoop and
just spread it on one side and let's see
what happens and let's dive in baby
let's do this
oh it's so cooling oh oh you know what
happen I just got it on my finger oh my
god look at my face this looks so cool
with the light think oh okay we're doing
more we're doing more there's so many
stars in this like there's so many looks
cool dad we're doing a thick layer me
I'm trying to like spread it out but you
want all the glitter to show
yeah look at me now without doing my
forehead looks like I'm wearing like a
ninja mask like I'm in mortal combat
nice
that's what sucked oh it's a toe that's
out there sotto sotto you get babe yeah
let me see yeah looks cool I look like a
superhero
yeah yours looks crazy as hell the
glitter looks Akon
it really does look like you're just
wearing a mask on your face that's like
it's cool okay so I'm gonna take my
iphone real quick and I'm gonna turn on
the flashlight the depth is crazy
because of all the glitter in it like I
was like it's okay when you put a
flashlight on it oh look at that you
guys I am living for this let me tell
you whoa like there's real hollow stars
in here like holographic real this right
now shine alright you guys so currently

yard at the dogs mm-hmm went did okay so

what my nose would go that is okay hey

five minutes and he has like a new
freckle yeah so oh and you're rubbing
your skin with a wipe this is fine oh

think it's pretty dope I mean
aesthetically yeah it's fucking sick and
obviously you feel oh I felt tightened
and refresh yeah always I mean always
from these glam glow gravimon's they're
always gonna I love the experience of
just putting it on I love masks in
general doesn't matter what the brand is
I just love that feeling of like you're
doing something to for yourself to
yourself I love the glitter it's fun to
stare at and it looks fuckin badass on
snapchat bitch yeah so we love it I
think it's definitely comparable to the
gravity mud family the iconic silver
mask so I definitely think it's fun if
you love glitter and you love skincare
