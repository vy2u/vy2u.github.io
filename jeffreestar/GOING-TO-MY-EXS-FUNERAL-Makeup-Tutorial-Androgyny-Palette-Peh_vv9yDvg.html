what's up everybody welcome back to my
channel I have a special guest here
today this is one of my closest friends
a lipstick NIC hi Nina
I got me to be here oh my god you guys
okay so me and Nicole had been friends
for a long time her handle on all social
media is lipstick NIC yes man how does
that mean okay I mean you're going to
print it whole I mean yeah like when I
started my Instagram I was like okay I
love lipstick my name is Nick my parents
would call me back so yeah was it Nick
yes witness crucial for eyelash curler
has to permanent yeah so like in the
Nook already yeah they go but oh my god
I I mean hi I'm a lipstick tattoo on me
in case everyone forgot look at how old
a Meryl I love that I love my like
actually are both ex-employees of Mac
especially where we met max BAM
yes Mac Hollywood an island Mac alumni
waiting related in houma MLA um
we're gonna get arrested after that yeah
so we actually met at the Mac counter
and just became really close and we put
a lot of shoots together done so many
ppl over the years but just yeah some
really iconic moments the cold painted
the infamous pink bandana school bandana
on my face Ryan went crazy all over the
internet a few years ago again we've
done a lot of magic together so I just
shot the beauty campaign for my
androgyny eyeshadow palette and the
palette is almost here so I thought you
know what let's have Nicole come to the
studio and recreate the look that she
did for me well you did all the looks I
did all the like smells oh look so much
fun just like BB look like we were
excited about it all day yeah so yeah we
just go in it bring it back when I first
showed Nicole DiPaola I said okay like
when you when you like look at the
colors what are you gravitated to right
away that's what I want you to do and
then we'll build off of that and do more
so when you saw I mean fetish is kind of
a star of the show yeah because you know
what sketch for max was one of my
favorite colors and I oh my god this is
like what I wish just looked like yeah I
guess like an intensified sketch so I
was like right look I love red and then
she went ham on frosting today and look
at
bitch like huh could we just look at
that leg you kill the formulas like if
you go around it it's so it's so buttery
and perfect amazing yes I can't wait for
everyone to dive into this palette and
to play with it and try it out now this
look is very I think like when I think
of this look I think of like very
classic looks picnic like this for just
high you know walking into your my ex's
funeral like I'm game over you over
well I'm obsessed with this look it is
so stunning and if you want to see her
create this on my face then keep on
watching
alright so we're about to beat his face
into submission and I had Nicole use
this primer on set the other day it
works pretty great on identity I like
that amazing this is by the brand Sicily
a little pricey but it gets those pores
to natch
I'm going to use this foundation on the
mayor soft fluid definitely also at me
is this with the photoshoot I fell in
love with it it's amazing it smells
expensive which i think is a good fella
crazy but it's also just the actual
application of it was amazing now it is
winter I am so pale so I do like to use
a little bit of a bronzey or warmer
foundation it gives me a little bit of
life okay next we're going to go on and
start highlighting what this is one of
my new favorites the shape tape
sometimes everything she's feeling my
pain again you keep reading this Laura
Mercier contour book I love that she's
very well used yes she is a seasonal I'm
going to go ahead and leave this one on
the start light and then we'll kind of
build it with progress you know I like
to do both like a layer everything and
the way she does my contour on the
cheekbones whew
we're going to bake you yes we're going
to use the powder by the man mixer this
is called about louder it sets under
eyes so good these are all over
underneath of Maca mineral powder these
are my favorite what is that this is
like so we're used without all over man
put this anywhere that I didn't make
okay then kind of lightly over the
contours so me Nicole both used to work
as a mac store not the same location but
I would go in and Nicole would help me
out and for some reason I was gravitated
to that that energy and her makeup was
so so late like I remember like I'm one
of those judgmental people that would go
into the store that okay I remember that
that's to make a yeah best makeup to
help me out because you know I'm like
hmm so I would gravitate towards Nicole
it should always have like crazy like
colors and like just weird stuff that
was a little you know unconventional for
you know like a Mac so even though Mac
is very creative it's still no not
everyone is down to wear six colors on
their eyes and make it look sickening
and then we started working together on
some shoes Nicole should give my makeup
for my very first ad campaign for
jeffree star cosmetics for the yesterday
it's just like literally yesterday this
over two years I don't know crazy and
I'm going to start building my contour
name's Alaura contour book oh yeah right
yeah medium contour medium
come on medium
okay summary the prime use my Mac
painterly Paint Pot in soft ochre Kosak
guzelyurt but yeah I left and I think
especially for your skin tone yeah I'm
just gonna be better then use just a
flat kind of concealer brush the little
synthetic if you will
so we're going to go on browse we're
gonna free him from brown yeah
everything to do on you we use the
Anastasia dip brow and blonde one
everything that forever
alright we're going back in with that
okay with the safety now the cold carves
out the brows of the concealer
okay so we'll Nicole's doing the prowl I
just look back on my channel and three
years ago you guys Nicole's did a pink
skull Bend and a Halloween mask on me
which was one of my most liked pictures
ever on Facebook back then and I'm just
clicking in I'm like oh my god someone
memory so if we go all the way down to
my channel you guys you can find it it's
a time-lapse of Nicole doing like the
sickest makeup like I'm sorry that was
so fun I'm like hi come on video and
video this is so fun look at my hairline
we're old man come on old scalp that
hair color is so fun
what fun okay so first I'm gonna take
the beauty killer palette or ease
relieving this was because I need this
China white to set and then everything
else is going to be submit and drogyny
palette cool
all right we're giving in to putting in
the charm one blush and it's going to
posit this all in the crease next time
use this NYX vivid bright I'm going to
use of the base not just the color
really needs it because they're so
pigmented but I just love to layer in
Bilby and temporary creams I would do
the creams and cream a minute Potter I'm
gonna take a little bit of this exact
same color as fetish in this palette
which goes to my school Emma where I
love these big ones really nicely and
then whoever's going to read us to fill
that we don't say the name of it add
blood a blood Thank You Felix
so now I'm gonna take a little bit of
Spanish yes
but my favorite shade in my own palette
I just love red calm it's so pretty
female a little flat Packer brush I'm
just packing it right on top of anywhere
that I put that red base all right I'm
gonna do is take my fixed lens this is
the oh my god coconut but it is
something new
sorry my brain is but wow that is
amazing
on now but I don't look straight into
the pan because beautiful on open Orenda
palette so I just bring my hand and
close your eyes and just going to take a
little bit of stick a little little
tacky I started with Mac products that
mean you have been using for so long or
never leaving our kit nope
never never never perfect and then take
my finger sniffing is your machine is
frosting frosting right oh my god a
little we could host come on I belong
now when I was creating this shade I
just wanted something that was really
pigmented but had like a cool golden
like not dual chrome but kind of a
shape-shifter type of effect they
totally have that so obviously like you
don't have to let it sit so intense
because it's a way which is about
anything else when you wet it if you
want extra drama but even if you don't
you want something it's super wearable
need to just wear this if you don't what
it is such a pretty gold shimmer for
your lid like mm-hmm
before I do mascara many use this makeup
forever what's a pretty color it is
pretty m40 it's like a yellow those of
the new aqua excels very beautiful
canary yellow it is I really like it
it's still brightening but that's like a
little bit different than a wear because
those added a little extra something and
I'm not play off of the frosting and
it's kind of like a yellowy gold paint
go ahead and look all the way up
next working with you mascara means in
roller lash from benefit my
tried-and-true I never use a little work
on anybody's giving up in your videos
obviously but I've never tried really
good doesn't smudge it looks amazing
alright next we're gonna do lashes these
are the spoil of some sweaters I'm love
I love these in my fav they're full
drama full drama and I said it was a
little spicy but they're full these are
perfect for officer this traumatic
experience put this simple sauce was
really easy to wear natural look next I
don't really need to do an eye liner
with this but I kind of want to just
select complete the eye up top so I'm
gonna use a weirdo these are eye safe is
another thing for the liner's all the
time just take a little bit of weirdo
just a super skinny brush well cuz that
brush and look down to the left
a little color to Geoffrey's cheeks from
Apple and we use this Marc Jacobs blush
and wine and last night is like a ball
is a really cool name I letting it all
right my favorite time of the day
timeline blogging I light we're gonna do
a nice frosting because it's
beautiful okay
you think it's on a serum brush right on
your cheekbone oh my gosh I'm sure now
we know one highlight is not enough so
Nicole's going to go in with my skin for
shade in peach goddess one of my
favorite it's my favorite as elbows but
my favorite I love it so much I'm going
take a little bit of this right here on
the arch Gujarat is peach goddess
I love highlight on the brow bone you're
like really tired all in this unit just
like helps to lift a little bit more
just so pretty in pictures for showing
video stuff like this is accessible
light so for list we going to do like a
90s moment so instead of using a liner
and a lip I'm just going to use
celebrity skin on the outside and then
I'm nude on the inside
last step is setting a face my favorite
all right yes Urban Decay all nighter is
my go-to so let's set this mug all right
I'm feeling feeling rather babies okay
whew I think the only thing that's
missing is maybe some hair change just a
change
yes we'll take it there all right we'll
be right back
all right girl that was a journey Gillan
an amazing one yes we made it it was
unreal I did it like I just listened to
mirror you guys off camera and I was
like oh I mean even though we did
recreate this look from our androgyny
shoot I'm still like a little shook
about it I don't think I'm ever taking
this off I was kind of like at the shoot
- like we had to go to right to a
different look yeah it wasn't like I
didn't enjoy while I didn't spin stuck
on anything we had to wipe it off and
move on to the next look and I was like
oh no I hate this throwing like I feel
like I'm destroying your art biting off
something fun sighs we got to recreate
