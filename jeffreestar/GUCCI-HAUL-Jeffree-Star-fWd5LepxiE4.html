channel today I'm doing my first ever
haul
what are those oh that just sounds so
funny okay but on a real vulnerable know
you guys I look back through all my
videos I've never done a damn hole yeah
I'm like okay I feel like I shop on
sephora.com and Ulta and Nordstrom and
Saks and Neiman's I don't have to do a
whole every fucking hour so I've never
done one but I got a lot of requests
from the other day I posted this picture
and everyone was like bitch what is that
fucking huge bag umm girl I cleaned out
the Gucci store we're just gonna be
really upfront about it
I clean the motherfucker out and I hate
that I even have to do this but YouTube
has been crazy lately with so many
people and opinions so I don't feel like
I have to say it but listen if you have
a problem with how people spend their
money
you shouldn't go worry about yourself
boo-boo because we are all allowed to
spend our money exactly how we want you
because we fucking earned it on our own
so don't let anyone make you feel bad
for doing you I see a lot of youtubers
and instagramers like never like fully
really being themselves or hiding who
they are you don't got to hide yourself
if you bought some fucking show it off
or don't show it off or wear it and I
think that so many people take things as
showy when there's just not the case and
you can be a really humble and
down-to-earth person and still like hem
eggs I don't really see why people want
to make such a big deal out of
everything but like my best friend Manny
says if you don't like it
don't fucking watch it now I am a really
into designer bags
I've been collecting designer stuff for
probably almost 12 years ever since I
started to get a little few dollars from
my space I've been collecting Louie
Vuitton Prada Fendi and Gucci for some
reason well I know why for some reason I
think they had a whole new creative
director because Gucci lately has been
so lame he lost silane when I say slang
I'm talking like I've never bought this
many pink purses before in my life over
the last six months I know I've put a
few of them in my favorite videos
because there
epic so I think since I've never done a
haul before I'm gonna make my own damn
rolls I mean those aren't really many
rules right well we're gonna find out in
a second so I have the bag that everyone
went crazy for on Instagram and my snap
I might block out my entire existence
but we're gonna try oh my god she's
standing up all right so here's the bag
it is literally the size of my entire
body my girl's mother fucking tree I
have to recycle this though for real
this is the jumbo size bag I don't know
what the fuck um I've never got a bag
this big before so I'm gonna be diving
into everything from shoes bags to
accessories to even makeup because yes
Gucci has some sickening a makeup but um
let's just dive into this right now all
right first up since I am a makeup
obsessed horror let's just dive into the
makeup so Gucci has one of the best
blush the formulas I have ever used the
compact is so cute that little logo very
iconic and it's very thick its sturdy
it's heavy and then BAM
uh-huh I've already used this a few
times as I bought it love this guy it
has the Gucci print embedded on the
makeup come on emboss you better work
and then it comes with a little brush
which to me is not really necessary
because who still uses these to apply
their blush I'm like girl the color is
gorgeous they have a lot of blushes this
one is called a soft peach and I am
obsessed with this color and then also
they have to have any views this one
yeah this one is called coral flower and
she looks like this like a little more
brighter tone version of that and then
last but not least this guy it's more
like a beige eat peach and this one is
called spring rolls which I've used once
before but mama needed a refill
so if you've never tried gucci makeup
before there are a lot of hit and a lot
of misses I don't
the entire line but these I am obsessed
with and then they had to go and drop a
primer on this primer obsessed bitch so
this is the BAM I'll shut the packaging
love the bottle very luxurious feels
very heavy this is called the Gucci face
soap priming serum and it's supposed to
be very hydrating I use this before I
did today's makeup and my skin is
looking really nice ever since I got
back from Bora Bora my skin is made no
really just like very alligator II I'm
feel like a crocodile lately so I was
scared of using something new in case it
was like really drying because sometimes
you'll see something that says something
it really doesn't do what it's supposed
to do this actually did now I've only
used it once so I'm gonna use it a few
more times um and see if it is really
amazing or if I was just having a good
day but um Cheers
in my August favorites I put in a Gucci
backpack that kind of look like a little
Sailor Moon and everyone was like where
the fuck do you get that because I guess
they only made a few which I'm that
shady bitch listen I'm a Scorpio and
when someone tells me there's something
10 made I'm like I'll take it I am
someone that just loves that just little
I don't know just like excitement it's
like it's very addicting I just love the
feeling of having something that is very
rare so that backpack was everything I
got so many compliments on it and then
they had to drop part to and let me
reach in here girl whoa oh my god I just
get off on on fashion I just can't
breathe okay so this one remember the
last night of heart this one has a
little Gucci pearl on the end and it is
in blazed in spikes and this big ol that
jagwire head is that a Jaguar that a
bear is it I don't know looks like my ex
it has the same magnetic pull and oh I
just love it
I'm obsessed I'm come on the chains you
would think that this might be
uncomfortable on your back but I wore
mine to Disneyland and I was fine so
this guy unreal if you want this I would
call them immediately because I know
there's only a few left in the whole
entire company so cheers to this new
backpack obsession of mine
next is a handbags web heart
palpitations right now my girl
so Gucci has this new print on their
purses and shoes ah this is the Gucci
ghost so they hired someone to graffiti
a lot of their stuff and just kind of
like stylize it definitely it's like a
whole new pattern oh my god you guys I'm
sorry but I love it looks like someone
took a marker and wrote all over it and
it's bright it's neon it's obnoxious
it's right up my alley um this has the
same sort of chain design as the
backpack and she is just perfect for
just wearing around the house running
errands is very easy to just throw
everything in here inhaler condoms
setting spray dildos everything will fit
in here and of course your wallet when I
saw it ghost purse outlet I had a moment
I'm stuttering because I was like and
then go she had to go and drop some damn
shoes the box comes in a gorgeous little
limited-edition animal print and then I
love how they changed a little bit to
match the bag I die girl and these are
the matching sneakers I am such a
sneaker whore in my house I have a
closet full of just sneakers I'm a
collector I love a limited-edition shoes
I'm like hi girl
mm ah I love these and I can't wait to
wear them there are more sneakers
because Gucci has so many new shoes out
I'm just like you better fucking slow
yeah
now these ones are I just can't I really
can't these are like ruby red slippers
and funny story I follow Gucci man on
snapchat he was wearing these the other
day and I was like okay bitch I see you
um these are just really comfy like
every day I'm going to the grocery store
I'm just hanging out I'm going to the
skate park
these are Willy comfy I have that silver
version I'm such a fan I don't know if
the beauty lights or not they're not
really showing the full potential but
when the Sun hits this oh my god girl
don't play me I'm just going to turn on
my iPhone a full lash light so you guys
can see oh that glitter though what oh I
died I'm like what's up Dorothy you
better step aside girl all right oh
these are really cute so in Nathan and
bought these a little low tops I'm not a
low top person at all but Gucci has
flames and a lot of their stuff now and
these are so they're just so fucking
clean though girl um I'm like okay and I
love it because it has a little pink
trim like me um and these are just
really convey Nathan loves actually just
skateboarding these my skating call my
earlier was not a joke I like to just
smoke weed at the skate park and read a
fucking Stephen King book while he is uh
doing all them damn tricks but em and
these are really cute for men so any
girls out there that want to get their
boyfriend's a birthday present bitch
don't sleep on these all right and a
last shoes of the day are these amazing
boots huh look at that heart first of
all I'm just looking at the heart like
is so cute these are a little pump boots
now look at that little animal head that
was on the
backpack is on here and it looks
something like this
now the other one has the Gucci logo on
it so cute but I mean come on the heart
that stole the show for me and the heel
is a really little so I love wearing
these to a business meetings like this
type of style and I cannot wait to wear
these for fall come on now they're kind
of cowboy but really high fashion and oh
I just feel so kind and this may be
boring to some people but we're going to
the fall season and now that I have my
hairline surgery sometimes I'm just not
in the mood to do my hair or it's just
you know it's been growing really crazy
I'm trying to tame all that new growth
so gucci has new cute little fall
beanies out white one i just gravitate
to you right away I'm like I love you
I'm not gonna mess up his hair but y'all
know what a damn beanie looks like all
in Atlanta they call him Scully's girl I
love it the classic Gucci red and green
and then this one's cute has a little a
little pattern on the front and then
listen I put in sunglasses in all my
favorites I am a sunglasses addict any
time I'm not wearing makeup you're gonna
find me in sunglasses so Gucci has some
of my favorite glasses ever on earth and
first of all the case alone is iconic
I'm like Earl that triangle shape though
stop a red sign okay so these ones these
almost remind me of like 3d movie
glasses they are really cute
they're mirrored come on mirror and they
have a little Gucci band and emblem on
the side which I love come on let's fuck
up this hair girl come on Bobbi pains
move over these are really crunchy very
big so if you have no eyebrows which I'm
probably the only person watching this
it has none perfect for no brown girl
but you can see a little bit of the eye
on the side I love these they're just
really cute they're really sickening
they're very like now let's dive into
some eccolo thing for the last but not
least now this is something that I
bought my assistant Alicia it was just

scenes with me so this is the new Gucci
fall little blue dress yes honey the
bumble bees the flowers and the color on
Alicia's skintone
