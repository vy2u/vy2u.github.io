crazy
Gucci haul now I did a Gucci haul a year
ago and the whole internet went nuts and
you know what girl
get over it cuz here we are again but no
on a real level you guys know I am a
fashion whore I've been collecting
handbags
for about 12 years now and I just love
luxury I know some people think it's
unnecessary or some people fucking don't
like it good girl go watch something
else so today we're gonna be talking
about this crazy custom baby pink Barbie
luggage set that Gucci just made me now
it took about six months to make and
girl we're gonna talk about this we're
gonna have a little story time right now
and show off some fashion so if you want
to watch that keep on watching if not
girl I got two years of videos in the
vault
six months ago I get a call hey Gucci
loves you they're living for you and
this is like the corporate people and
they were like they want to do something
cool free like what is a dream item or
something that you've been dying for and
I went to the store now I love luggage I
travel a lot you guys know I'm always on
some damn airplanes on snapchat and I'm
like okay pink pink pink pink obviously
my house is pink where are downstairs
today by the way quick note if you hear
a weird humming in the video my fish
tank is a little bit over there off
camera and the cooling thing that
regulates everything is humming so if
there's a weird humming in the video I'm
sorry
slap me so I look in the store and I'm
like okay luggage I love luggage but
Gucci only offers their luggage in black
blue and red and I'm like I have enough
black luggage to last me a lifetime so
much Louis shit I'm like okay I need
pink like it's really hard to find pink
and designer stuff so I said I would
love a pink luggage set now you know me
my bitch ass is like girl I ain't ever
gonna make me - probably gonna call Lady
Gaga or Beyonce and be like you want
that luggage set first they made me the
only pink luggage set in the entire
world
I am dying and gagging as a collector
I'm just like oh my god so imagine my
little ass is like okay six-month wait
time I forget about it I get a text from
my girl hey here's your luggage that
just came in and I'm like oh my like I
just I died so Gucci luggage they have
three main pieces and we're gonna show
them off right now because I've been
dying to show you guys these amazing
pieces so here is a very large backpack
and how good should make smaller
backpacks this is
mein big boy you might have seen future
or a lot of rappers carry the black one
baby I got the pink one I am obsessed of
course you know the Gucci monogram is
all over everything is so beautiful down
to the patches the gold zippers and this
thing got a lot of room I'm like don't
on a trip already I left all the
stuffing in here so so it has shape but
when you do take the stuffing out girl
when you peek inside every last detail
is pink and I am just like over the moon
so the process was pretty cool they
actually sent me swatches of like seven
different pinks and they said pick one
out so I sent them packaging for my
brand and I said I want like that
bubblegum pink not too bright not too
light like in the middle and they killed
it
so here is the backpack I am obsessed
with this already I'm like alright we're
using her tomorrow it's big you guys I'm
just gonna put this on for you and just
show you um she's big Hey
alright now the second piece girl I
gotta reach behind me right here
is the crazy big duffel bag now these
are so iconic for Gucci
I remember seeing me like ten years ago
in the magazine and I was just like one
day so this is a very surreal moment for
me right now
um this shit is stunning very good for
just going on an airplane walking on
going to Vegas throwing some shit in a
bag rap it's a rap so this guy she is a
lot of room now the cool thing about
this is that Gucci was like we're gonna
take it every step customization so they
made me a really cool lock and key pink
everything and they put my initials on
here which is so cute with a little
luggage tag I'm buying in the third item
they made for me is this stunning
carry-on luggage my heart this one is so
sick it's heavy I'm like I'm about to do
some bench presses on someone now this
guy is really cool as a big pocket in
the front and of course you open it up
and first of all can you guys see the
detailing they even put Gucci on
shit around the tires it's like
everything is so cool
now let's open this bad boy up Oh a lot
of room for us of all pink in here pink
here so cute so this is just for a
little bit no loading trip and here is
the lock where the key goes so this
luggage set honestly a Barbie dream come
true I couldn't even believe when I got
the call so shout out to Gucci for being
so amazing to their customers and
there's even more like oh jesus take the
wheel
okay so I'm sure a lot of you know I am
a shoe whore I love high heels I love
sneakers I love boots I love everything
so Gucci also had a moment where they
called and said hey her guy who
literally hand makes and customizes
shoes for all the celebrities would love
to do a custom pair for you I was like
girl I whipped my head around so quick I
was like okay sure
uh-huh would love it inside I'm freaking
out I was living and dying so pink it's
hard to find some good real pink Gucci
shoes now you do have a little loafers
and sneakers like these ones I got lucky
all paint kisses all of it
oh I cannot with this just like horsebit
moment right here I'm done but they said
hey we would love to make you some pairs
of shoes and I was just like oh so I
went to the store and they had flown in
the shoe maker from Italy he literally
did a mold of my entire foot so we're
talking like real custom not like okay
you're a size 9 or here this or that
mold of my damn toes my foot my ankle
everything I was like you know I never
danced before I was having like alright
okay okay we're good so four months
later your shoes are here I'm like so I
got three pairs made I'm going to show
you the main event because this is like
such a cool moment for me I love this
big boy up here I was gonna break her
back it comes in this crazy wood box
initiative hard it is so heavy and look
at that it has this crazy Gucci emblem
like laser-cut in there
I'm gagging and then let's open her up
so you know my extra ass had to go to
the limits and I was like okay I asked
the guy I go do you do a lot of like
pink shoes like full-on pink like let's
just take it there and he's like well
you can do whatever you want you can
rhinestone a piece o you can do did it
I'm like you could do what was röszke
so I did a boot that goes up to my knees
and the full thing is all pink I mean
let's just show you guys right now so
when you do do crazy custom orders it
comes in a stunning crazy box they give
you a shoehorn
that's pink okay now these are only in
the store when you tried them on so the
fact that they gave me one I was like oh
my god this is so iconic
so come on shoehorn alright so here is
the Jeffrey star Gucci shoe full sera
ski all pink leather white laces I am
done with this beautiful like oh the
heel the heel so first of all we got the
Gucci right here we got pink everything
and then I gotta show you guys my
favorite part we have to zoom in on this
so normally when you show your shoe size
like this one right it says your size 39
40 whatever you are
and that's European size if you don't
know they always put it here this one
says made-to-measure made in Italy with
the Gucci signature and it says size J s
what I saw that I died it's a little
things so this literally has my initials
on it one of the kind only I'm gagging I
think I have to put on this shoe like
and if there's anyone out there that has
a shoe fetish this is gonna be your
moment alright now I know the laces are
crazy long right now they also gave me
pink laces black laces they went above
and beyond so they gave me like
everything girl whoo all right you guys
I am done talking about the customized
stuff can't believe it's even here I'm
gonna cherish it forever such a moment
alright I'm done talking about that now
also I don't know what it is but Gucci
pumps stuff out so fast I'm just like I
don't know I can't keep up but there are
so many clothes shoes in bags so I got a
lot of stuff this week for me make up
some really cool stuff so if there's any
dudes or boyfriends or husbands out
there watching you might like something
video but let's go off on shoes now girl
I know in California it's kind of always
summer here so I got the new little
rhinestone flip-flops these are so
adorable love them has a little Gucci
little stripes right there on the side
and these are so comfy and they're very
thick so they give you a little platform
so if you're short you might like a
little inch for me I don't mind being an
amazonian queen but these are sickening
the next are these I didn't say knit I
call them the Spice Girls
Gucci platforms full glitter gives you a
lot of height girl like six four in
these I love these are so fun very club
kid very New York and I love the Gucci
brought these back like High Spice Girls
which by the way the Spice Girls is one
of my favorite groups of all time and
they're tattooed on my back all right
already talked about these pink loafers
obsessed with those Oh girls these know
these came out a few days ago and I died
for an all-over print and I love these
little low top sneakers they are so
adorable you get the green and the red
on the back and they're very comfy I'm
like I might be living in these for a
minute I mean how adorable are these and
they come in men and women sizes or for
anyone so the whole world can wear these
right now let's talk about my favorite
pair of shoes this month here they are
these insane low top hot pink bubblegum
vinyl with these crazy Ostrovsky
crystals in the shape of hearts like I
die and you know Gucci always has to
have the detailing with the red and
green I love it these are so cute
they're almost like like rockabilly or
like maybe from some like bowling shoes
if you really want to read me to film
but these are so cute and oh my god
didn't even notice look at the back you
know that shoes new when there's no dirt
on the back yet but look at the B
imprint I'm done
all right this may be one of my favorite
bags of the season pink everything they
are not playing games this is a stunning
bag and all velvet with crazy stones on
it I live and breathe for this bag now
the little button is under here a little
clasp as you can see that right there
and she is very cute it fits your iPhone
a few credit cards your compact a
lipstick and some mace girl now this one
I can't I'm just like hi
look at the heart on the back it is so
cute
one of my favorite bag to think of a
season now I'm someone that if I really
like a bag I might get it in every color
on the planet because I just don't want
to let it go
so with that last bag I just showed you
they also put out a hot pink version
more normal of course with no stones on
it for a more business casual this
gorgeous like Barbie hot hot pink now
this one girl mm-hmm this is the loved
Gucci bag black suede with all the pearl
detailing we got the embroidery right

to seriously settle down so this is a
more big version compared to what we
were just talking about and I love a big
bag I love small bag I love a massive
bag I just love that addicts in general
all right now let's talk about a few
accessories that I have been living for
