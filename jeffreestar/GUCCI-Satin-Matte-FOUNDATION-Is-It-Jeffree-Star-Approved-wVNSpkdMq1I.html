channel now today I'm doing something a
little exciting and now you all know I'm
the first impressions
Queen open here and one of my favorite
brands Gucci
they now they put out makeup a while ago
it was kind of like hit or miss not a
lot of people talked about it it wasn't
really like advertised everywhere I
haven't really seen a lot of youtubers
or makeup artists really anyone in
general like fully embrace the Gucci
beauty brand I've used a lot of it on my
channel before I love the eyeshadow
palettes I love their primer that
 primer I'm growing yes the Gucci
face silk primer is so good of course
I've been using this under foundation
for a while now for the last few months
but they then they had to go drop a new
foundation now here's the weird part is
I was looking online and Gucci calm for
some reason does not have the foundation
yet it says coming soon not available
but I was on neimanmarcus.com
and they actually launched it early so
you know my bitch ass was like high
overnight shipping right now I got a
film with this on Neiman Marcus is where
you guys can find the foundation right
now hopefully it will start to you know
go and spread out their wings and get
into all the retails drawers but for now
whoa
let's talk about this foundation now you
all know I am a Gucci whore I love their
clothing I love their stuff so I was
actually online looking for a new purse
I'm like okay foundation have a seat one
second and they just put out new bags
and had to get this amazing like sky
blue with the embroidery oh my god um
this was just everything so I was like
okay girl yes I found my bag holler it's
not sold out yet and then this
foundation slapped me in my face and I
was like what bag so these retail for
$65 beome and I'm like okay I mean you
guys know I love a luxury foundation
Giorgio Armani's luminous silk is one of
my favorites and that is actually the
same price point so I wasn't like really
taken aback we all know your
for the luxury name of the stuff
and a lot of times high-end foundations
are amazing I've had a good success rate
on this channel with the luxury
foundation so I'm gonna talk about this
guy for a minute and then we're gonna do
a full reveal I'm gonna put it on we're
going to see what the hell happens so I
have not even tried this yet I opened up
the Box this morning now here's the
problem with online shopping who is with
me how do you find your damn shade well
you don't um but if you do a lot of
online shopping you can kind of guess by
clicking the little shades on the
website I mean it's kind of a hit or
miss so me I got three shades because
I'm like how am I really supposed to
know on the shade like names are weird
it's like 0 30 0 70 0 90 and that was in
my cool toned fair type of range now
here's the only problem I have with
Neiman Marcus I'm going to show you guys
hopefully we can try and see this so I'm
on the website here and there's eight
shades now that's the only thing that
makes me a little annoyed about brands
when they first launch something so I
did some research on Google and it says
that eventually there will be 18 shade
so I'm sitting there like well Gucci is
one of the most prestigious brands in
the world I'm sure they have a billion
dollars and also owned by another
company now who owns a million other
brand
so I'm sitting here like girl you're
gonna launch eight shades that's it
there is a million people out there in
the world you at least gotta start with
twenty to twenty-five that's just my
thing I'm like there's not just eight
skin tones out there so that's a little
annoying um so I ordered three I have no
idea which ones are gonna even look good
on me so we're about to unbox these open
them up and see what the hell is going
on now on the box unit carton comes in
their standard black with gold foil and
of course it has the Gucci monograms all
over it with a print
now I'm looking on the website and it
says that this is a refined liquid
foundation with the lightweight
consistency now it's a satin matte
finish right so it says it
affects the skin thanks to the 3d micro
pearls ooh the formula emphasizes the
natural contours of the face and
provides a matte finish the
three-dimensional pearl delivers this
look by scattering light reflection
creating a multiple shaded effect when
skin is viewed from different angles oh
my god so if I'm in the bed I'm getting
 flipped around girl my skin's
gonna look good every angle I'm down for
that
so I guess okay let's close this up oh
and this has SPF 20 in it which
sometimes the SPF can make the
foundation look weird once it settles
and oxidizes so that will be interesting
now this has one fluid ounce just one so
I'm looking let me grab some other
foundations to compare this Armani one
has one fluid ounce okay there's another
one the toothpaste one has one fluid
ounce okay so I guess that is very
standard in foundation world I'm just
curious about my other favorite like
what's that D or two point three okay it
is an aerosol so I'm sure there's less
product but I'm okay so you are getting
a good amount of product for I think
your money so let's unbox this and get
started all right so the lightest shade
I got it says zero 30 let's see what you
look like
oooh so it comes in this gorgeous
frosted glass component with the shiny
glass Gucci monogram all over it and the
logo on the top I love how that looks oh
it feels heavy now I'm all about the
weight of something if something feels a
really light weight to me it just feels
kind of like and she didn't really care
this feels nice I mean you never know
how the color of course is gonna look
until you open it up and swatch your
skin so this is that shade and then zero
seventy it looked like it was one shade
darker oh okay this one might be the
winner so okay let's open the other one
and then 0-90 looked a little more
bronze e for me but sometimes I'll
actually to match oh my god you guys
that's the lightest one second to
lightest and then the darker one okay
I'm gonna try them well I think the
smart thing to do it first of all I
think it would be a good idea to try one
side with a damp Beauty Blender and the
other side with the artiste oval brush
and just see how they blend because
sometimes I'll put on a foundation and
this makes it look a lawless and other
times not so much and then this one
comes in in just a slave's a day so I'm
like you know what we're gonna do a
little half and half and see how they
blend out now I think the only thing
that's fair would be to I guess put them
on the side of my face real quickly and
just see if we can get a color match I
always shake on my greaseless to shake
these okay guys so I think let's open
this up whoo it has a beautiful gold
little chrome pump and I'm just going to
put a little you know when you first get
some you had to pump it like sweeps poor
little bugger bones okay barely barely
all oh okay okay that could work hmm oh
that's cute I love a little foundation
on my nose anyone else
all right I'm also going to open up the
lighter one and do the same thing oh my
god that looks so light hmm what if I
mix you guys should i mix okay
so what I want to do is I'm gonna wipe
this off and then of course I'm gonna
put on primer like I normally would and
then we're gonna get started this is the
real light a shade that's like what this
is so pinky or like red almost and then
what the is this oh my god girl not
today alright guys I just wiped off
those little swatches oh my god I put
the third one on it was so dark now I
got the three lightest shade this one
was like straight-up yellow on my skin
tone it was not good so I'm just gonna
go in with the lightest one the zero 30
so it's only fair of course that I do
primer so I am going to use I mean might
as well use the Gucci primer since we're
doing good
you know I love this one I have been
telling all my friends to get it it's
just like really moisturizing no it's
very similar to my Bobbi Brown vitamin
face base that I've been loving since
the beginning of time you guys know I
used to use that a lot um this is a
smaller product alright so I'm gonna
take this and I guess we're gonna let
that primer have a second uh huh nervous
you guys I'm always like oh my god I
love this brand if it doesn't work I'm
gonna be so disappointed and if it works
and it's amazing Thank You hallelujah
but it's scary coming into these like so
what I normally do is I just put my
foundation on my Beauty Blender I don't
know how thick this is so I'm just gonna
do one little dollop as they like to
call it and I'm just going to go all
around now if this does not match my
skin tone exactly um that's what happens
if you shop online and don't
know so alright let's buff this out and
see what happens
okay so first impressions is it is very
smooth looking like she's smooth now
it's not really really matte where it's
like oh my god my skin looks even drier
sometimes really really matte
foundations kind of just make me look a
little like a little dry little Mojave
Desert if you will the Beauty Blender
definitely buffed it out really nice now
is more on the medium coverage side now
I only used one little pump so before I
do the other side look at that though
the difference the foundation makes so
that discoloration and redness and that
mmm that's like alright I'm gonna do one
more look at the half of pump
oh I basically just put on enough for
probably a whole nother face um but you
know what that's what I'm all about so
let's buff this out
oh right I was scared that I put too
much on but it blends out really really
nice with the Beautyblender I'm like
come on water activation okay this sign
is pretty damn good you guys I'm it I'm
I'm like yes yes bitch
oops okay let's get you your teeth brush
now you can put it directly on the brush
if you want sometimes I do that but I'm
just gonna see what happens today now
I'm gonna go in with the artiste oval-8
brush and we're just going to brush this
on and see what happens
but usually to me there's a difference
of just how the foundation looks when
it's applied with this versus this but
I'm like kind of shook right now I'm
shocked
um there's really not a difference so
I'm looking all over and I'm like
waiting for something bad to happen
it didn't really oxidize which is nice
it really stayed the same now a lot of
foundation sometimes I'll like leave the
house an hour later and I'm like oh my
god it look a little orange does anyone
else have that issue but this one very
true to color now let's give my final
dots let's just get into it you
guys now my skin has been a little more
dry than normal so I was a little afraid
of what was gonna happen but you know
like I said earlier putting it on with
this versus a Beauty Blender nothing
drastic happen to me now that it's been
a while the artiste won almost looks
smooth they're actually like it just I
don't know it even feels no it feels the
same this just maybe looks smoother so
that's definitely something to consider
so the pros are my skin looks great
it's very airbrushed all my
discoloration is really gone it's not
too cakey where it's crazy but I would
love to quickly on camera just kind of
set like do a little concealer and set
my face and then see if anything changes
but I don't really have anything
negative to say I know that's kind of
shocking but this foundation is pretty
good now for the price point is it as
amazing as my luminous silk that is
these
exact price I don't know I love this one
I think a little more but you know this
is obviously my first time trying this
so I definitely going to give this a
little more we're gonna give it a spin
this week and try it out more and see
how I really really feel about it long
term but it's kind of good you guys it's
kind of good now it's not so Wow more
I'm like oh my god everyone leave the
computer in the phone and go get this
right now it's not that mind-blowing but
it's up there it's pretty damn good
so I think it's only fair if we put on
some concealer of course I'm gonna go in
with my tart shape tape and I'm just
going to put some on and then set my
face with powder foundation and then
we're just gonna see if anything happens
all right so sometimes the foundation
will coagulate or get weird if you put
concealer over and it doesn't like you
know match all the time but this one
buff and blend it out I haven't even set
the under-eye and it's looking very
fresh I think the last step to see if
there is anything weird that is about to
happen which I don't think it is but hey
you never know I'm gonna go in with my
show do we Armani
yeah let's do the little Armani the
luminous silk compact foundation so I
get asked a lot about this brush I use
it in a few videos ago this is from one
of my favorite brands called lemare they
are a primarily a skincare brand now I
did use their foundation before in a lot
of videos you know I love it but miss
brush is just so what soft and like oh
just feels amazing so I'm just gonna go
in with this guy and who a lot came up
holy and I'm just gonna press that
in to my skin
oh I think I'm gonna give my skin a
little hydration because she's feeling a
little dry today which is so rare for me
I'm like oh my god so I'm just gonna use
this touch of luminous dewy skin mist
and just have a moment so alright guys I
think the last final thought is that
this foundation is pretty damn good I
don't really see any negatives at all
which is kind of shocking so all right
Gucci I will give it up to you now I
didn't mention this in the intro but
they came out with a foundation when
they first launched their brand and it
was like a luminous one it was so sheer
it reminded me of that Laura Mercier
candlelight foundation it's like really
like almost like a BB cream and I didn't
love it so finally they came out with
something balm and I'm a fan so I'm
gonna be trying this out over the next
few weeks and we'll see if it stays or
if it goes so I'm pleasantly surprised
I'm like alright guys thank you so much
for watching this video as always if you
guys have any foundations products or
anything new that I'm missing of course
sound off in the comments below and let
me know um how you you know think this
look all right guys in a few days I am
jet-setting off to Hawaii for Christmas
so um I'm off guys I love you MA
