cut open some items with a honey yeah so
there's been a lot of viral videos going
around of a lot of straight dudes
heating up a knife to a thousand degrees
and cutting open items random things
random things we've seen the coke bottle
uh yeah what coke bottle I've seen
cutting open - Kylie lip kits actually
I've seen cutting open to play-doh like
random things random ass shit but no one
has done a full spectrum of makeup and
luxury items so yeah I'm mad I felt like
