what's up everyone welcome back to my
channel today I'm going to be using
something really special
ah do I know what it is well I'm sure
you can tell from a title but BAM the
new graveyard girl tart collaboration
this is the swamp Queen palette listen
first of all before I even looked in the
inside I was dying for the packaging it
looks like real wood this is amazing it
sticks to the whole Tarte family but it
is so bunny like I just I just smiled
ear to ear when I opened this the pr
package you guys was genius I mean hi I
got a little alligator
I want to eat him he's so cute delicious
tried to steal him and I was like no
this is the cutest thing ever and it
came in come on
alligator wrapping paper I can't
alright so her collaboration is this
amazing palette it has eyes shadows that
has a blush bronzer and a highlight I'm
like ah treasure hey guys no just
kidding but this is I just can't stop
looking I'm like oh it's just so pretty
okay the reveal been so good you guys
bunny also made two lipsticks which okay
now this one when me and bunny first met
a few months ago I was in Texas and she
picked me up took me the mall and we had
such a fun time and she was wearing a
lip and I was like girl what is that
lipstick and she was in the testing
phases of this one so it's so cool to
see it done and on my mouth because hi
this color is everything this palette
and the lips as a collection they are
limited-edition and they will be on
tartes website starting June 6 and then
this slowly start to roll out into all
the stores a few weeks later so go and
sleep on this today I created this
entire eye look and the lip using this
collection so I think we should dive
right in but before we play with this I
just want to say that I think it is so
amazing that all these youtubers are
collabing with really huge brand and
it's it's just wild because I come from
working at the matte counter and back
then only huge corporations would you
know they would collab with like huge
celebrities or that type of thing so the
fact that all these brands are believing
in youtubers and make
artist I think is really really dope so
the fact that bunny got to do this is so
just surreal and I'm so proud of her so
bunny you really killed it with this
though I'm gonna dive in and let's start
playing today we're going to start off
by priming our lids with the Urban Decay
primer potion I know everyone is
probably like oh my god why are you
using primer today I'm just in a mood I
saw someone use this in a review again
and I was like I forgot I have primers
so why not use it I like to put a lot on
why not right now this one is limited
edition what is this one called enigma
hi enigma and instead of using my
fingers I'm just going to apply this
with a brush all over the lid and I'm
gonna bring it up even to almost my
eyebrow okay now that the primer is
settled let's dive into the pallet now
you guys know I love to do a really
light shadow all over for my face so I'm
gonna use a baby with a flat synthetic
brush and I'm just gonna put it over my
lids now I love the shade right off the
bat because it literally almost matches
my skin tone so it's gonna be a perfect
base for me and I'm just gonna drag this
up and out okay for my transition color
I'm gonna go ride it and use Dogman this
is such a dope rusty Brown like warm
like orange base that was a long
explanation but it looks really really
pretty so I am just gonna take a little
what is this this is a little Mac two
one seven and we're just gonna go right
in with this one now I'm just going to
take this and blend it right into my
socket oh good morning
this color is oh so pretty I'm really
loving warm tones I think for like 10
years I just wore hot blue black silver
and blitter so I'm kind of I'm loving
getting back into the season now I'm
gonna take this and bring it right down
to there so we're gonna kind of line
that up with my eyebrow and start
blending it into that nose contour for
an extreme smoke
you look and I'm gonna bring this down
and go a little my lashline not too much
so we're just kind of creating a little
the eye shadow is just hugging my entire
eye now we're gonna go in with a little
blending brush any eyeshadow blending
brush that you love now we're going to
dip back in the Dogman just ever so
slightly and we're just gonna drag up
and that light shadow that I already
applied earlier is really gonna help
buff and blend this out
obviously the brush is doing its job but
this is just a little extra just a
little extra precaution and it just
really helps make it look really nice
I'm gonna go back in one more time you
guys know smoky eye is a lot of back and
forth back and forth you want to blend
until you have carpal tunnel the next
day because we're not playing games
today and then you're gonna want to
repeat the same steps on the other eye
and make it look identical all right now
we're going to go back with that same
brush and I'm going to dip into sippy
sippy high it's a really that's the cue
shade name I love this color it's like a
chocolaty maroonish Brown I know might
trust me I know my color explanations
are ridiculous I love it the undertone
of this is so pretty it has like little
fine sparkles of gold in it so we're
gonna dip right into her and I'm going
to put this in my crease so it makes it
really deep set and then we're gonna
drag this down a little more so that's
gonna give us the illusion of like a
really deep set like full eye mm-hmm and
notice how I'm still leaving space in
there for maybe nothing maybe Colin
maybe liner I don't know
what I want to do yet but I'm gonna just
bring this in a little more and then if
you want you can go back in with your
blending brush and hit Dogman and go in
there and blend it out even more
depends on how blended you want to be
but I feel like you for watching my
channel you want to be Belen dead so I
like to start doing it all right now I
took that darkness and I brought it out
a little past there and then you're
gonna take this again blend it in
together and just kind of flick up and
out and then we're gonna go back in with
sippy sippy and do the same thing over
here all right
we are blended and looking smoky so this
is like a beautiful champagne gold and
I'm just gonna take this little math 242
brush there's already glitter on this
from the other day so ignore that that's
on the other side so we're just gonna go
mm-hmm and I'm just gonna place this
right in there oh now this shadow is
yummy now I was thinking about wetting
the brush for like extra intensity but
it's so pretty as it is I'm like I don't
need to come on amazing formula I love
an eyeshadow if it doesn't play
games and I'm just gonna pack a little
bit more on and put a lot on that inner
corner like I want my inner corner to
look Extra Terrestrial today whew so I'm
gonna bring it all the way in to where
my brow bone and my nose connect because
I'm just that type of bitch today and
then we're gonna go back in with this
brush one more time and you don't have
to dip into it again if you don't want
to but I'm just gonna blend out the gold
and the brown a little bit so it just
blends more seamlessly come on seamless
blend how's your day alright now because
you guys know I cannot live without more
sparkle and gold I'm going to just take
sassy bun one more time and I'm gonna
put some in my inner corner and I'm
actually going to bring it down in to
the
we're lashline Oh like I cannot with
this color you guys hi anyone from Tarte
is watching I'm gonna need a sassy bun
single shadow for my birthday this year
thank you okay so I don't want to bring
it too far in because I'm gonna smoke
out this bottom but I think that is good
enough now we're gonna darken and
smoking out the under eye so I'm gonna
dab in a little bit with a man cat and
I'm gonna start that off and I'm just
gonna take this really flat synthetic
brush and I'm going to just start
lightly shading under my eyes and then
we're gonna blend it in with that gold
and I'm gonna add in liner to my
waterline I don't know what I should do
maybe it's either black or a cream or a
white so let me just smoke out this a
little bit more and then we'll figure
out the liner all right now that they're
smoked out I'm gonna darken them a
little bit more and make them like
really blend nicely and I'm gonna make
them blend out a little more you know
just a little more smokey right now the
edges are not how I want them so I'm
just gonna use a little morphe brush hi
and we're gonna get in with mad cat one
more time and now this is really gonna
give me that ability to like smoke it
out way more dark and dramatic I need
that effortless blend mm-hmm now this
little detailed shader brush really lets
you get in there without causing a lot
of Fallout and it just really blends
nicely alright now it's time to add
something in my waterline and I don't
know if I wanted you back and really
like intensify my eyes or if I want to
do a cream eyeliner I wish we can do
like a livestream poll right now but I'm
gonna go with the cream and see what
happens so this is a color pop of liner
these really stay good in the waterline
and this is shade honey
this shade is called honey dude and I'm
just gonna see how this looks in the
water line I love a good noodle liner
and it's sometimes hard to find a pencil
that will really stay in show pigment
but I love this a nude liner looks good
on anybody I feel like it's just a
different kind of look everyone bits
does black or some people don't do any
liner at all you know but I think this
is essential and really takes a look to
a whole new level it just went from
Walmart to high-fashion in 2.3 seconds I
like to really go in there so I don't
have to touch up later and these
actually really stay in the waterline
great and they're at a really affordable
price so if you haven't tried to color
pop liners I highly suggest it what are
we missing here I think I want to do a
little bit of a wing yeah I think I'm
going to do it a little bit of a wing so
I'm just gonna do that really quickly
and I'll be right back
today I'm using that Kat Von D tattoo
liner this is in limited edition
packaging it was on Sephora for a hot
minute I think it's so cute and high
liner is on fleek let's do some lashes
all right now for mascara I'm gonna use
the Sicily Paris mascara this is that's
so curly I love this brush it's so cute
mm-hmm and this one quickly codes your
lashes you have to be careful because
the brush is really big but this is
perfect for putting on mascara before
your lashes so your lashes are black all
right now let's do our bottom mascara
hold your damn breath and don't
this up look at that one lash hair it's
like sticking out and being so extra
like honey don't try to steal the damn
show you're just one hair in the bunch
is so weird that's like really bothering
me my girl there we go her lashes today
I'm going to be using the hood of beauty
style Jade if these are so pretty and
I'm gonna be using my SCE toe lash glue
and that's been one
all right the lashes are done now let's
do some cheek action the thing about
this palette that I love is that it has
like a little contour kind of warm
bronzy moment and then as a blush and
then as this blinding highlight i swatch
this on snapchat I first got it and I
was like oh like caught my breath I just
I had a moment so I am going to be
dipping into this little sweet tea
bronzer and I'm just gonna be using my
little NARS kabuki brush I'm just gonna
lightly dab in there because I mean hi
the pigmentation is real on this one
alright so I'm just gonna there's no
just barely brushed into my skin so it
just kind of warms up my face a little
bit just a little bit more than it
already was mm-hmm all right I like to
be subtle with my blush and bronzer so
I'm living for this now I have been
dying dying mmm
just watch Gator wings on my cheeks now
I swatch this on my hand my fingers my
labia minora but this my cheekbones are
like if you don't put this on me right
now
so I'm okay look I'm a frog in
my throat all right now this highlighter
you guys I have been dying to put this
on my cheeks so I'm just gonna use a
little morphe 510 brush as always and
we're just gonna this is so pigmented
I'm like do I want to go big and just
take it there I mean obviously so I'm
just gonna let you a little huh oh Lord
and first of all gator wings is such a
cute name for a highlight I'm
like girl don't play me bunny this is
the cutest thing ever and I'm sorry this
pigment is so beautiful the pearls on
this highlighter are like ooh I feel
like I just put like gold glass on my
cheeks and I'm just like oh my god just
like brushing it in and it's like
melting into my skin you guys it's like
oh my god and you don't really need to
go back and forth that much I'm just
like really putting it into my skin like
high this will become a part of my whole
entire soul life okay the cheeks are
done now of course we're gonna do a
little
Cupid's bow action uh uh if your mouth
doesn't look like you just sucked off a
leprechaun add 10 more layers please
all right now that knows we're gonna
take my finger just go move a little
once and by a little I mean my entire
nose oh my god I can't I just can't I
can I don't think I could finish this
look if I didn't take my eyeshadow
blending brush and going with the
highlight it's a little one to swipe and
put this just right below the brow bone
for that extra intensity all right I
think I'm glowing enough for my
neighbors to call the cops so let's get
to the lips and finish this look all
right for lips we're gonna be using
Texas toast I mean I'm sorry this this
lip is like perfect for this entire look
so ah let's put some on already obsessed
huh ever since I first saw this when I
was dying to try it and uh uh I'm just
like I love the tone it's like so pretty

to just put on some hair and skin all
