channel this video has been in the works
for a few months I know a lot of you
were like uh hi why are you this is
finally a recap of the last two months
ever since I got hair transplant surgery
the healing process for this entire
surgery is a little bit different than
your average like nose job or you get
your breasts done you don't get like
instant results after a few months it is
a long process there are some needles
and blood showing nothing too graphic
there are pieces of skin that are shown
so if you're freaked out by anything
medical do not watch any further since I
can remember from like eighth grade on I
noticed that I had a widow's peak where
my hair would come more towards a point
and my temples were just kind of like
bare of hair so right now I'm sure you
guys are looking and you can see this
darkness all around that is my new hair
lines I think as I got older or older I
just really didn't like it my face shape
changed I got my lips done and my teeth
so of course my face appeared folder and
I've always just really hated my temples
so of course if you can fix it why the
fuck not if it's for you then do it for
you if you don't like something about
yourself and you're like you know what
I'm gonna change it then do it if you're
doing it for other reasons because you
want to please somebody or somewhat
older your ugly fuck the motherfuckers
girl do you and I did me so long story
short I had hair transplant surgery what
does that mean me and the doctor are
about to explain it all for you and then
at the end I'm going to show you guys a
little reveal so if you want to see how
all of this happened and what the hell
I've been talking about for months and
keep on watching so basically I had from
ear to ear I was cut and about an inch
of skin was taken and all of those hairs
in the back were transplanted so what
you're not going to see in this video is
that skin being cut out it is a little
too graphic for YouTube we definitely
will show you the skin in the petri dish
and all the follicles which is really
I drew into science and medical stuff
but you're not going to see the crazy
cutting in the back so I want to just
spare you all that it was really crazy
once they check all the skin from the
back they flipped me back over on my
right side and then they numbed my
entire forehead so from my temple to
temple here they did a lot of injections
and of course the swelling from the
numbing kind of happened later on but my
entire forehead was completely numb I
was wide awake I was watching movies
actually so I was just kind of sitting
there on the operating table and there
was a big TV in front of me I got to
watch movies and I didn't feel anything
while it was happening so once they were
finished outlining the entire new
hairline
they showed me a mirror obviously I'm
swollen it's like a million little red
dots but I already could see the vision
and I was already like so excited like I
know it just happened and there was no
healing yet but I was already so stoked
because I could see like the vision of
what it was going to be already and I
was like ah thank you god it worked
they took this diamond-shaped needle
that dr. ziering actually invented late
I developed as a diamond shaped plate so
I thought amazing the center of it is a
diamond shape and then the two ends are
a little like almost like a paper cut
yeah so enables the graph to gently be
placed in the center and then the blood
actually acts as a little bit of a glue
and so it just seals it right in there
so so once it's placed for it briefly
it'll seal in they went to town on this
temples girl so where everything was
missing they filled in and then they did
as you can see here they did it lower
and just kind of create a more feminine
shape which is what I wanted
and while I was happening there was
really no pain I didn't feel anything it
was just kind of annoying to lay on my
back for a long time but obviously
that's normal and I got their way so as
the needle was going through my skin
then
yes thank God I didn't feel anything but
it was really weird like the pressure of
it if you've ever had a tooth pulled and
felt that like oh my god like you know
this just supposed to hurt but it
doesn't but you're just kind of like
hear and feel the pressure so I
definitely felt the pressure of it but
it didn't hurt but it sounded really
weird almost like if you were rustling
popcorn or like hitting the styrofoam I
think is what dr. ziering said pain was
undetectable but as the valium kind of
wore off I got to like go on my phone
and I did a little Instagram video
talking about it had the nurses like
filmed the back of my head which was
crazy and I was like is this too much
for people I don't like it's Geoffrey
Starr and his way today's girl once all
the incisions were done they basically
took all the follicles that they took
from the back of the head and they
implanted them and all the tiny holes
and it was so cool because each layer of
holes had like a different number of
hairs so like the front of my hairline
will be obviously thinner so it's more
natural and then as it progresses it's
going to get fuller and fuller so it's
crazy how they can literally mimic how
my hair used to be one person will
sliver so they'll take the strip of
tissue that we have and divide it into
slivers like slices of bread and then
what we do is we divide those slivers
into the individual flicker units so
it'll be a sliver and then the cutters
and then and that's what's going on
there once the surgery was done I was
really really stolen and really
exhausted so Nathan drove me home and
the first night was really difficult for
me because you have to sleep at a
certain angle you can't like sleep all
the way down like laying flat because
the blood will I crushed your head and
it's gonna affect the surgery I just had
so I had to like sleep it like this
angle which I'm such a side sleeper I
know we're all different we all sleep
different but like I always sleep on my
side so for me it was a really difficult
thing gone for some indica medical
marijuana
you know some cuddles and I got through
it the next day I had to go to the
doctor again for a follow-up and they
said everything looked amazing I was
doing exactly what I was supposed to do
and I got the first laser treatment out
of six to help the healing and I felt
great the whole front of my new hairline
has no pain it's just the back where
they took all the follicles that is a
little stinky but you know that's why
Jesus created vicodin so I'm excited I'm
beeping maybe I'm done
that week I had to go back a few times
because they had to help wash my hair
for me you know that is so tricky cuz
you're like okay all of these follicles
were put into my head and I'm like oh my
god I have my you know my original hair
still here so it's like how do you wash
and clean it so they actually help do it
for you with like a shampoo bowl like at
the salon with your neck back and they
help wash it for you because it is very
delicate until you know it all heals and
you know fuses together they had to also
wash all the new follicles and that skin
because it was very tender and sore and
like the skin after like days later
starts to flake off and they have to
actually help like pull that out so your
scalp can breathe and heal properly
on my last day of checkups I got to
thank the doctor and if you're watching
this dr. ziering I love you thank you so
much for taking such good care of me I
am healing amazing you guys and after
that last checkup it was scary because
it's like okay now it's my job to heal
myself correctly and the thing is the
surgery takes months and months to fully
heal I did get the surgery in March and
so far I am having crazy results I feel
like a whole new person and you guys
want to see a sneak peek so before I
literally had no hair underneath this
part and I'm like let's just do it I'm
like let me move this pink out of the
way this is like come on old hair boom
doesn't that look crazy so this is all
new hair growth this was completely like
non-existent and this is the only like a
month
half of growth because first the baby
skin and all the little baby hairs had
to shed and then there was a period
where there was like nothing so almost
look like how I did before the surgery
and then the hair finally started to
grow so it's been a long process and now
you know we're entering July and I could
not be happier they were like oh damn
that's growing quicker than normal so I
cannot wait to see this by like October
when it's like full fully grown and just
you know looking a little bit more
itself a few days after the surgery I
called the doctor and I was like I
allowed to wear a wig because I had to
go to this event with Beauty Blender and
they were hosting an event for a new
product and the singer brandy was there
at a bunch of other influencers and
youtubers so I was like I cannot go to
that with a bloody scalp so the doctor
okayed me to put on a wig and I went to
my favorite wig shop in LA and had a
blast so you may notice some of these
wigs from my channel as I've been
filming with a lot of these that I tried
out of the store and I'm like I had a
blonde one I need like ten more of these
going for like a racetrack vibe like if
we're going to stand out we're going to
stand out few weeks into healing I had a
vent to go to it was a rock festival
called self help which is kind of like a
little mini Warped Tour kind of like a
one-day Warped Tour there are a lot of
vendors and a lot of bands playing and
it was in San Bernardino California now
the cool thing about it is that is my
roots I come from that punk rock world
so it was really awesome to bring my
makeup brand to you know a real like
rock festival I was unsure how it was
going to do and we killed it the
response was so amazing there was so
many subscribers followers and fans and
customers that came and showed us so
much love so I had an amazing time and
of course I wore a wig to that event as
well because my hair was not healed I
was actually really bruised and like had
a black eye under my right eye
thank you full coverage concealer for
saving the day on that one
Oh
I'm wearing these fall parts right now I
actually have it with me
I love his lips I wear like a lot of
makeup and stuff so then like I kept
following him in a time just like yeah

wants to be like different or kind of
be themselves he's a great like the role
model to look to because of how
