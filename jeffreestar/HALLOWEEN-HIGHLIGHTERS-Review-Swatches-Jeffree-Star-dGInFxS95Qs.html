channel
now today we're going to be diving into
some Halloween highlighters now what
does that mean few months back the whole
internet went fucking crazy for the
rainbow highlighter and I know so many
brands have made dupes so bitter laced
beauty you had a huge hit on your hand
and when huge corporations start taking
your idea you know you did something
really awesome so this brand is back and
bitter laced beauty has not one not two
but four Halloween limited edition
highlighters and the owner personally
sent them to me early and I'm like girl
you know I love an exclusive now these
are not in their compacts I got them all
individually wrapped and I put them in
this cute little Z palette I'm going to
be swatching one of them on the right
side and one of them on the left side
and then I'm going to swatch all four on
my arm as well so you can see how they
shimmer but I definitely want to test a
few out on the cheekbones now if you
guys remember bitter laced beauty was a
Etsy store that is now on their own
they're independent they're killing it
now these highlighters are handmade they
are customized they look amazing already
you know when I see a highlighter I'm
like but these all retail for $28 each
and I think that is really cool for
someone that you know makes everything
themselves and they're not a really big
corporation so shout out to better lace
Beauty I love you and let's dive into
these guys now I want to point out that
two of these shades are vegan and two of
them are not so the ones that I'm going
to be putting on my cheeks are actually
the ones that are vegan oddly enough I
am so attracted to this blood-splatter
one it is called a Saleh boom and it is
so unique it looks like a dexter made a
highlighter and i'm gonna be trying that
one first so let's pop her out whoo I am
excited alright so this one is described
as a white gold flaked base with an
intense metallic blood-red splatter so
of course you can use a brush and try to
get that full effect on your cheek or
you can swirl it around and make it into
its custom own so I'm gonna try let's
just try the blood I mean that's what
we're here for I'm just going to be
applying this with a real techniques
flat brush and remember when I tried the
rainbow one I literally just took it out
of the pan and I just went like this ooh
okay
and we just go over it one more time oh
and I'm just going to be applying this
straight down the cheekbone so let's see
what happens
oh okay so I think the red definitely
needs to be blended I think straight on
obviously your cheeks are not going to
look blood-splattered so I am going to
take a little morphe 5 10 and let's
swirl this around and I'm just going to
do a little swirl swirl BAM
these are really the lining in person
I'm like hi pigment let's just put this
oh oh there we go baby I'm like woo and
I'm gonna take this all the way back to
my hairline because I'm a sick bitch I'm
gonna take this right by my brow alright
so first impressions the gold in this is
so even like perfect for a kind of
holiday time even though it's Halloween
I'm like this for Christmas though what
okay my cheek literally looks
radioactive so I'm already in love with
this one like this one gets is this
Geoffrey approved
it's fucking jeffree star approved baby
now this next one is called toothache
and it has little candy corns imprinted
into the powder which I find really
adorable website says sweet yellow
orange and white or gorgeous on their
own but once blended together they make
the most beautiful warm tone gold so
this shade has finer shimmers for a more
metallic sheen alright so I found this
little NARS contour brush I'm just going
to sweep this across once twice and see
huh look at it on the brush that is so
cute alright I'm just going in right now
what's up cheekbones you better fucking
work
BAM see I think when you do it once with
this brush to definitely gonna do it
again because the intensity is not there
and this brush is not obviously for
highlighting oh that is really cute it's
literally like a Halloween rainbow
version let me do all the way to my
hairline yes God honey she's feeling
snatched today oh oh my god actually
works whoo come on fall I'm just gonna
go over it with the powder one more time
and just go right over that to really
intensify it huh oh my god you guys yes
now this is not for the faint of heart
but I feel like anyone can pull this off
get that fuck out of your comfort zone
and join me baby I almost don't want to
ruin it and mix it so I'm going to swirl
it around on my finger and swatch this
on my arm because I'm obsessed at the
third shade this one is called the next
supreme I'm living for that name very
witchy very the crafts so this one says
that it is a murky silver with a purple
to intense green shift and then it says
this shade is also extremely iridescent
so I am going to swatch this on the back
of my hand and give my little tiger some
glow and I'm just gonna use my finger so
let's just give it a little one - ah oh
wow
whoa okay cool so I'm just going to
literally oh my god look at that I'm
like hi can I wipe one of these off and
try this on maybe I'll just write on my
nose a tiny bit because I'm sick in the
head look how pretty that is it has such
a cool like duochrome kind of feel to it
so I'm just gonna take it and I'm just
gonna dot in there really lightly oh my
fuck Oh what my god I just doused my
entire nose and highlighter okay this is
definitely a really pigmented extreme
just how I like it now I am going to
swatch the fourth one on my hand and
then I'll swatch the previous two on
there as well
so let's go to the port here is the
fourth one it's called hocus pocus has a
really cool spiderweb embedded into the
powder it looks a really dope and then
the website also says that this one is a
rusty orange lime green and purple that
blend together to make a gorgeous lilac
shade hocus-pocus has large shimmers
that make for a more sparkling
highlighter hmm I'm just gonna take my
trusty finger right here and we'll just
do a one two oh okay the glitter is
intense look at my finger and excuse my
nails honey but she's growing all right
so I am just going to take this on the
back of my hand
one two Oh BAM oh wow that one is hmm oh
it's like pinky reddish chrome what not
chrome copper excuse me I'm late this
one is so stunning I'm literally just
gonna take this swirl it around and put
it right in the middle of here like hi
highlighters don't have a baby
what oh my god my cheekbone is about to
blast off into outer space like coming
to talk about the texture for a second
they are really soft really buttery um
they're not dry they don't feel weird
they're really they're nice let's swatch
slay and tooth ache on my hand just for
fun and I was going to use a different
finger for all of them back to slay and
I'm just going to use this finger BAM I
hate roading the pattern on the thing I
more scream don't move that gold takes
over everything okay I'm wiping off my
index finger and now we're going to take
toothache again and we're just going to
one to go cute looks on my finger all
right we're just going to put this one
right here and biome oh how it looks so
cool as you can see they are all really
pigmented I think that this one on the
end the slate one it looks a little
lighter but once you layer it twice like
I did on the cheek obviously it is
really intense so if you're not an
extreme highlighting person then you
definitely would love this one right
away and of course if you're a little
more daring and like to amp up the
extreme beauty these other three even
this one though I feel like you could
literally wear mascara lip gloss and
wear this on your cheek and be like okay
because this one I can't stop looking at
in the monitor I'm like tiny best friend
alright so let me um give my final
thoughts how are you guys I have been
taking a few selfies with these a
blinding highlighters and I just got to
say that I'm a really big fan of this
brand now one thing that I know a few
people might roll your eyes at is the
price point twenty-eight dollars might
be a little steep for a highlighter but
I think they are really unique and of
course remember that these are handmade
these aren't just pressed a million
times by a machine in a factory that's
why I think the price point is worth it
it's cool and I love supporting Indy
brand these are definitely really cool
and no one has really done anything like
this before so props to bitter laced
beauty um you have another hit on your
hand and I cannot wait to see what you
come out with next girl now you guys
