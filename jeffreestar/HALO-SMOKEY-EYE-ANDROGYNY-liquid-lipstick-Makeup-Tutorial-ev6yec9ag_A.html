pink fabulous channel of mrs. Jeffries
jar for today's look I wanted to
recreate a look I saw Jacqueline Hill
film recently she did this beautiful
halo smoky eye and when I saw I was like
mesmerized and glued to the screen like
it looked perfect on her and I I was
inspired I wanted to do my version of
course my face shape is a little
different than hers so I tailored the
look to fit my bone structure but I've
tried to stay true to what she did and I
love it I think it's really gorgeous
it's an everyday look that anyone could
wear it's very dramatic but also subtle
at the same time so it's not too you
know it's not too paunchy I love
watching other youtubers and I love
watching what other people are doing
because it's so fun to be inspired I
normally wouldn't do this look at myself
but after watching hers I was like zany
oh my gotta give this a try so I hope I
did her look justice if you want to see
how I created this and keep watching
let's get started now I haven't used my
Bobbi Brown vitamin base base in a
minute this is what I normally use on
the daily if you've never tried this get
the out of your seat and get in the
car and go to Sephora now Beauty Blender
actually just put out a new color this
is the nude egg I love this color
I'd love to just take this put it in and
you're just going to coat your entire
face with this and this is really good
for people of normal to dry skin if
you're oily I would stay away from this
and get something a little more
mattifying for foundation I'm going to
be using my trusty do your air flash you
guys know I can't live without this and
I also tried a new cocktail normally I
mix this with the Armani but today I'm
going to be using that lower ab Mercier
silk
cream photo finish foundation now I
gotta shade a little darker than my
normal skin tone just so I can like a
little more bronze e I'm going to take
the air flash as usual now we're going
to take this guy and I'm going to be
using the RT
ovale brushes I'm going to probably
break the rules and just apply the
foundation on the brush and before I
brush it I'm going to dot it around my
entire face now the reason why I like
this is it really cuts down the time of
blending it's like minimal and you're
pretty much done quicker than you've
ever gone ready in your whole entire
life so let's get to brushing and
blending all right now because this
foundation is a little bit warmer I am
going to do some really light concealer
so I'm going to take the Urban Decay
Naked skin it looked really
full-coverage I think on camera but it
just blends really nice and the cool
thing about this product is a little
goes a long way so you don't want to
overdo it now I'm actually gonna take
the Beauty Blender
and buff this out so let's go to
blending all right concealer is blended
now before the under eyes want a crease
on me I'm going to be setting it with
some loose powder and my favorite is the
Chanel when I keep going back to it and
I love to take it with the damp Beauty
Blender and I'll just literally go like
this and dip in and there's some powder
on it and I just press it under my eyes
and buff and tap it in alright under
eyes are set now I'm actually going to
set my entire face with Studio Fix from
mac cosmetics I've been doing that
forever and that's just like my go-to
secret to keeping on that foundation
throughout the whole day so I'm going to
take my trusty Tom Ford powder brush
we're just going to dip into that Studio
Fix and I'm not going to do the under
eye areas but I'm going to go around
everything else all right now let's
contour this face for contour I'm going
to be using the morphe M 5 to 7 ever
since I saw Jacqueline use it I got 5 of
these brushes and I can't stop using it
so thanks for the tip girl I'm going to
be going in with my trusty Kat Von D
shade + light but I want to try
something new where I don't go as deep
into my contour as I normally do why
because
I'm just trying new stuff so I'm gonna
start my contour a little normal than I
usually do and I'm going to stop right
there usually I go a lot lower but I
want a different type of effect today
and that's the cool thing about makeup
is you can literally have a different
face shape or look if you want to now
we're just going to carve out this chin
and just contour along the hairline all
right now
I use this morphe e47 brush the other
day and I really liked it for the nose i
blended it out with a Beauty Blender and
I just liked the effect now the cool
thing about this when it really chisels
so if you don't want to sieve your nose
contour try something else but this one
made my nose really slender honey like
she is going at it if you guys randomly
hear my dog delicious screaming in the
background there's people hanging
curtains and doing construction in my
house so he's going a little cuckoo
alright for brows I'm actually gonna
draw them on with a new pencil honest ah
see I came out with a new product called
the brow definer and I am going to use
shade blonde today this is my first time
ever using this so let's see what
happens
I think I'm a good critique at formula
and this one's really great it's sharp
alright now I'm going to finish off the
brows with the pro pencil from honest
off yet now I love this because it's a
nice highlight and I'm just going to put
this directly under the brow and I'm
going to take a Mac 2 v 2 brush and just
soften that line now let's get started
on the eye shadow for this look I'm
going to be using the Anastacio
self-made palette now Jaclyn created a
whole ilyich with this so I am going to
use the same thing I'm going to be going
in first with sherbert bingham right
there and that's going to be our
transition color and I'm gonna be going
in with a morphe four-for-one blending
brush and I'm just going to get in there
and left it out now you guys know I'm
big fans of bringing the transition
color all the way here just because my
face is longer I like to give it that
extra and you really want this well
blended so spend a lot of time going
back and forth and I'm actually going to
take that same Mac to five tube brush
and just blend this out a little bit
with no product it's the one I used
earlier and we're just gonna soften and
then go back to the other side and
repeat alright now let's go in with a
Mac two one seven brush and I'm going to
be dipping into this color right here
hot chocolate and we're gonna start by
taking that color and tucking it into
the crease here and bringing it down to
the lid and I'm just doing packing
motions so we're going to avoid any
fallout all right now I'm going to be
taking a pencil brush this one is from
Chanel it's number 19 I love this one
it's a pencil brush but it's still kind
of domi and more thick at the top
instead of being really narrow so you
can use any pencil brush that you want
and we're still going to be using the
hot chocolate shade this time I'm just
going to be going in side here and this
is how we're going to create that halo
effect and just pack in that color and
then I'm going to take my brush right at
the transition color and just soften
these edges out a little more now for
the middle color this was like my
favorite part of Jacqueline's look was
that metallic shimmer in the middle I'm
gonna be taking this Mac brush you know
what a brush you use it so much the
number wears off you have to like put it
in the light like this is a two-30
grow-op had this brush for like 10
 years I'm going to be using the
pink champagne color right here now if
you wet the brush this is like oh
it's heaven so we're gonna take my fix
plus as usual and we're just gonna then
you're gonna go in with that color and
just coat your brush with it and just
start placing it right on the lid oh my
lord oh so pretty I want to die like I
don't know
I want to be buried in this color on my
funeral end I was going back and forth
and packing and I'm bringing it right up
to that transition color but not going
on top of it so you want to stop it
right as you get to that and now that
that metallic color is laid down you're
going to go back in with your brush to
add the hot chocolate and you're just
going to kind of blend out the edges
softly I didn't put any new shadow on
this I'm just kind of going back and
forth so now for under the brow we're
going to be highlighting a little bit
I'm gonna be using the shade up here
called the buttery I'm just going to
take this and softly blend it on top
just so it gives it a little more
dimension to my love now we're under the
eye I'm going to take Ella masca I
pencil this is shade Vow it's like a
creamy flesh tawny white it's not the
stark white I normally wear it's a more
yellow toned one which I love so I'm
going to add that in my waterline now
you could do any color you want with
this brown black whatever
I love lighter tones because it really
just opens up your eye and gives you a
new look alright now we need to start
smoking out the under eyes so let's get
started on that smoke out the under eyes
I'm going to be taking this Smith
cosmetics to-20 brush
I love how flat this is it's really good
for tucking under the eye and I'm going
to be going in with hot chocolate one
more time and I'm just going to start
roughing that color in and connecting it
with the outer parts this part like
doing surgery so be really delicate if
you are heavy-handed definitely pause
and take like 20 hits for me now I'm
using this Mac two and seven brush that
we did already up here and I didn't put
any new product on it I'm just going to
be blending it out all right now for
extra drama I'm going to be adding in a
little bit of glitter in my inner corner
and I'm going to be using this Mac
reflex red this glitter is so pretty
it's hard to tell in camera until I put
on my eye but it's like intense and I'm
just going to be putting that down with
a little Mac to 1/3 brush you definitely
want to put down in kiseop because the
reflects fine glitters tend to go
everywhere so I'm going to be using this
violet Baz loose pigment glitter
adhesive and I'm literally going to take
like the tiniest amount you see how tiny
that is you
just place it in my inner corner right
there now I just take the glitter and
open it and I just dip right in there
your brush should be completely coated
and I'll just knock off the little
fallout back into the jar and then
you're just gonna press it right on
there all right now for mascara I'm
going to be using my Too Faced better
than sex and it uses in a minute
definitely been missing it I heard a
rumor on Instagram mother coming in with
a waterproof version oh my god thank you
lord
let me just coat these entirely all
right now for the bottom we're going to
use the same thing and we're just gonna
coat them entirely you really need
bottom mascara for this look because
well you need bottom mascara
everydays now it's time for eyelashes
I'm gonna be using these blinking Beauty
lashes it says it's style number two on
the front so let's give them a whirl now
I've been staying away from the latex
duo but my inner corner has never come
up when I use it so I'm gonna be going
back in and using this will let the glue
dry on this one and we'll do the left I
don't mean least a little bit okay I
can't believe I did these sober but my
lashes are done so now it's time for the
main event
highlighting okay so I think because
highlighting is becoming so popular
every brand from joint store to high-end
is creating one Burberry actually
started making makeup I think a year or
two ago and I wasn't really a fan of the
formula wasn't that great but they just
put out this new highlighter oh my god
it's from their new runway spring/summer
2016 collection and i swatched this on
instagram and snapchat and everyone
about died i'm gonna be using a more
feet 510 brush this is my favorite for
highlighting I can stop using it
oh my Wow okay
definitely don't use a sweat or you're
gonna have some issues oh my god it's so
pigmented I wasn't expecting this oh wow
this is in sanely pigmented like I want
to turn the camera off and just roll
around in it naked and you guys know my
favorite is Cupid's bow now because my
foundation is a little dark ribbon
well this highlight is like extremely
poppin so normally I do the nose like
really highlighted I'm gonna really
avoid that today and just take my finger
and just me do the end I could literally
start myself all day right now so let's
move on to the lips before this video
ends up being 20 hours long for lipstick
I'm going to be using my own liquid
lipstick shade mmm bring that out
sweetie I'm gonna be using androgyny now
I can't believe how fast that shade has
sold and Hum like the reactions people
are giving me it's so cool to see such a
big response so thank you guys for
showing that shade so much love I
definitely have to wear it today and I
only have one lab sample left all my
friends literally raided my office so I
keep it safe hidden in a purse because
no bitches be Shady
in case you haven't heard the rumors and
drogyny is now permanent a part of my
line so it wasn't a holiday white cap
and now it's part of my permanent line
yay now you all know we got to shake
them liquid lips for five seconds
now that the lips are officially dry we
got to go in with some setting spray and
I'm actually going to change it up and
use the Lock and Load makeup setting
mist from the cat mangy beauty and we're
just gonna give my face one shoe huh all
right
