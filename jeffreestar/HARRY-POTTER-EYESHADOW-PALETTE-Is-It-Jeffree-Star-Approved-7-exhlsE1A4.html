channel today we are going to be diving
into some brand new products that I just
got in the mail from a brand called
storybook cosmetics now I know a lot of
you have seen there I must say the Harry
Potter inspired makeup brushes that they
came out with they look something like
this I know a lot of Beauty youtubers
have tested these out I ordered them a
while ago got them in the mail and I
haven't tried them out yet because I was
waiting for their eyeshadow palette to
come in now i pre-ordered it I think
about like a month and a half ago I said
you know what let me wait to try the
brushes for when the palette comes and
the day is finally here
so I had a quick confession to make I
have never fully watched a Harry Potter
movie I know don't I know all of you at
home were like now nathan is a huge fan
of Harry Potter he has watched all the
movies he's been to the amusement park
at Universal Studios here in Los Angeles
he has every book seen every movie
probably like 10 times I've watched the
first one halfway through and it was
really late at night and I may fell
asleep on the couch no tea no shade I
know a lot of you or most of you have
watched Harry Potter and you know way
more than me so the eyeshadow palette
comes in this beautiful little velvet
casing and then you pull it out and it
looks like this I love it like the
packaging is stunning now this is $52
retail now it's fit you guys can see it
looks like a like a book that you would
obviously put in on your shelf at home
in your library if you will so you open
it up and it has a giant mirror which I
love and it has 12 shades so I of course
have not washed these yet I haven't
tried them so on their website actually
says that there are three formulas in
this palette there is a Mac a metallic
and then a pearl it also says that this
is a vintage style storybook complete
with gold swirls detailing I mean girl
we see the packaging extending now here
is one thing that I find a little
strange asked nay to come upstairs and
look at this and I said are these
symbols or anything that is like real
Harry Potter because on the website it
says that storybook cosmetics is proud
of this
unique original creation inspired by all
the magical stories they grew up with
and love this palette is not sponsored
by endorsed by or associated in any way
with the owners or creators of any other
pre-existing literary or artistic work
so I know that in the future this brand
is saying that they are going to license
other brands and do kind of like
collaboration type things but I thought
this was licensed through Harry Potter
and definitely inspired by Harry Potter
but on the website I guess they don't
want probably to get sued by the creator
of Harry Potter
so I said Nate what does this packaging
look like to you and he said it is very
like based on the Slytherin part of the
books and this is very slow they're in
and then he said that's the S on this
thing it looks like the Slytherin font
so I was looking Slytherin up on my
phone and definitely the snake or this s
does kind of look like this I mean
obviously it is Harry Potter inspired
probably for legal reasons they can't
say that or maybe they couldn't get the
license as Harry Potter ever going to
come out with Cosmetics who knows but I
obviously think it's amazing and I'm not
throwing any shade I just was a little
confused by that I didn't even know what
Slytherin was and then I found out that
I actually run and control it because
yes I am Lord Voldemort as so many
people on YouTube advisor call me that
on my girl what some insult so I've
already of course done my foundation my
contour and my highlight I have just
primed the lids with some Mac painterly
paint-pot
and of course I know you're all going to
be like girl what is that highlight it's
a little blinding this is from the brand
as your way cosmetics and it is called
skinny dip Grob and going in on that pan
don't try me am let's open up this baby
I love it you can fold a mirror back and
it kind of sits on your vanity it's
really pretty I love the shade names are
a little different than a normal brand
they are very like I just love the font
it's really cool so I'm going to go in
first with this matte shade now I'm
going to go on the website and make sure
oh no this is not matte my bad on the
website it says that it is a pearly
white so it is a Perl formula
so I definitely do not want that as my
transition color so I'm probably going
to go in with charms it says that it is
a shell pink it looks more like a daisy
like camel tone so I guess we're going
to try that first all right so let's see
by dipping in this for the first time
what these look like oh I mean that
coated the brush immediately which I
appreciate I don't want my hair to get
in the way so we're just going to clip
her back as always so I'm just going to
take this shade charms we're just going
to put it right in the crease now I do
have no brows today I've been loving the
no brow look this is something fun and I
haven't done it in a while so first
impressions I like to tell Matt all the
way back oh that's a really soft pretty
color like that is really pretty and
light sometimes I don't like transition
shades to be really really intense
depending on the look I don't even know
what kind of look I'm going to do today
we're just going to roll with it and
we'll say this this brush is easy to
hold because as you see when I'm holding
it my fingers go right in the groove of
here and yes - all right so that blended
out really nicely now of course there's
only five brushes so I'm going to have
to go into my personal collection and
grab a few there is a shade that is
really pretty in here it's called a
broomstick it is like this chocolate
matte Brown up here now I am just going
to take what kind of brush should we use
okay I haven't used this one let's try
her out this has the little gold
medallion on it definitely coated the
brush immediately
now to soften that I'm going to go back
in with this brush and what I like to do
is like I like to mix a lot of time so
I'll take the brush and literally once
go into that color or twice and then
I'll dip into the other one just so it
kind of gives me a little blend if you
will and then I'll go right in there
where I press that chocolate brown and I
will blend up just so it looks very
seamless and very airbrushed so now I'm
going to try the shade sorcerer it is
this ruby red metallic I'm just going to
pop a little bit into the crease just to
give it some full layer and a little bit
of color now I'm just going to take it
I'm not going to go all the way down I'm
just going to start from the middle and
just kind of go over the brown so now we
have three shadows in here and this
looks pretty alright you guys I love how
this is looking at now I do want to add
some kind of pop above the color and
kind of blend these all together so I am
going to go in with this pearl white
shade called prophesy and I'm just going
to take a I know I used to love
highlighting with a little morphe 510
and I was going to go into that color
I'm just going to take this and kind of
put it above the shadows that I've
already blended together and now we're
going to add a little extra layer and
pop to it okay
so if you do have an eyebrow of course
you're going to put this color right
below your brow hairs and it is going to
pop and you look stunning
alright you guys I love how this is
looking so far and now I'm going to go
in with this shade called B which it is
a coppery gold metallic now of course
I'm going to try it without oh wow come
on Pearl
I was going to wet the brush but I might
not have to and I'm just going to pop
this on my lid and let's see how it
looks if I think I need like I need some
fix plus I will but let's see how it's
gonna pack on oh wow hmmm okay pigment
that's not bad you guys okay this is
applying as if I'll had like kind of
already wet the brush I'm a little shook
right now not going to lie alright you
guys I just tucked some of the gold
shade bewitch in here now I'm really
like feeling this blue shade Merlyn and
I really want to try it so I'm going to
go in with a little Tom Ford pencil
brush and let's Ben
in here and I usually Blues have a lot
of fallout with brands but just going in
here not that all the brush is fully
coated let's just try this out so I'm
going to take this and just really
slowly work it under the lash line and
be very careful because I don't know if
there's going to be fallout or not now
I'm going to take this brush with a
little bit of that transition color that
we first started with I just kind of go
underneath the blue and soften it
alright this shade it looks stunning now
I'm going to take some max smolder I
pencil I just kind of tucked that in the
waterline about the sneeze oh my lord
all this powder is like up my nostril
girl all right let me take this pencil
it was a little cold going to warm that
bitch up okay
now I'm going to do some mascara of
course no shocker here I'm going to be
going in with my benefit roller lash and
let's get these lashes all ready
all right you guys this look is really
complete I'm not going to do false
lashes today I'm kind of living because
I haven't worn makeup in a few days so
my real lashes are actually like oh
they're like long and pretty so I'm
going to keep that but I'm going to go
in with my Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray give her a little shake
and we are about to set this makeup and
then we're going to dive into some
swatches real quickly and see what the
rest of the palette looks like but first
that's it
whoo she's feeling refreshed baby all
right and now let's get just watching
all right so I'm going to do some finger
swatches of the other shades that I did
not get to use today I will of course
use them in the future
now this matte grey one called cloak
looks amazing so I'm going to take some
clean fingers we're going to go in like
that and oh hello and we're just going
to do this on my hand or real quickly to
see what they look like oh it's a really
pretty bitch what okay now we are going
to do this metallic green it is called
potion so I'm going to go in with this
finger and then we will go in with Salem
over here and let's see what these look
like
here is potions BAM
ooh that is pretty now my hand has no
primer has nothing on it this is just
bare skin and here is Salem oh I was
like a little duochrome moment that's
pretty now we have cauldron right here
and then we have a spell book so let's
take a cauldron with this finger I'm
running out of fingers y'all and we'll
just be right here whoo then it's a
pretty like blackish gray all right now
we're gonna do spell book with my thumb
and then we're out of hands here red
hands red of fingers all right so I'm
just going to do that right there
whoo that one is stunning okay I'm just
going to say this wokai we're going to
swatch one more so there's one called
jinx I'm going to clean this finger real
quickly on a paper towel all right so
this finger has been clean we're going
to go dip into this shade right here
called it jinx and let's see what this
one looks like
like a silvery pearls going oh it's like
a gray silver pearl all in one okay hmm
I'm like guys so pretty much unless I
got highlight to these guys so I'm going
to give you my final thoughts right now
I already have the answer I will say
this I'm sure you guys are not going to
be shocked by this but the storybook
Cosmetics wizardry and witchcraft
eyeshadow palette is Geoffrey star
approved now of course you guys can see
from putting it on my eyes and these
swatches this palette has pigment now
for $52 in all the shades you get with
the packaging and everything combined it
is definitely worth the money I think
that this palette is stunning the
pigmentation is on point and for an
indie brand I am very impressed and I'm
really happy to support a company like
this because I think they really knocked
out of the park with this launch
now the brushes I will say were pretty
good I did not know what to expect
because I was like okay the handles are
amazing but are the bristles going to be
cheap are they going to be nice they're
not the best brushes on earth they
definitely kind of feel like that
vegan synthetic type of eye I want to
take drugstore but kind of drugstore
brushes I guess
of course the packaging is stunning but
it blended out everything great there
was no problem that didn't drag or make
anything look patchy it was pretty good
now I know that they are coming with a
lot more stuff they have brushes that
look like real roses which of course I
pre-order because I know you guys are
all going to ask me to try them out so
those will be coming I think next month
I love that this bread and lets you
preorder stuff and then it comes in a
few weeks or a month later so you know
there's no anxiety like oh my god am I
going to get one and they do restock
often and have several pre-orders so I
think this palette is sold out right now
but of course who knows if you're going
to be watching this today tomorrow or in
a month so check on their site if you
want to get this and I'm sure they're
going to come out with a lot more stuff
so I am really pleased with this brand
so shout out to you ladies you guys are
on an amazing start thank you guys so
much for watching this tutorial and this
first and oppression and I will see you
on
son bye guys love you MA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
