channel now today I am so excited to
finally reveal my jeffree star cosmetics
Holiday Collection now I've been doing a
few little sneak peeks here and there on
Instagram and snapchat the other day I
posted the unit cartons and I revealed
that the color of my packaging this year
is hot cherry glossy red now if you've
been a fan of my brand for a while you
know that last year we did all white and
gold packaging and listen I learned
quickly how insane the holidays are and
how amazing and unreal and devoted that
my customers are because last year I
introduced my shade and drogyny and I'm
like okay I'm gonna order enough for
probably like a month the first three
hours last year gone and I was like you
guys made a bitch oh now I definitely
planned ahead way better than last year
and hopefully things will not sell out
in an hour at this time
definitely produced a lot of units and
I'm really excited that you know 2016
was a year where I got to expand my
business now my website is fully almost
finally all back in stock it's like
crazy playing catch-up and I think a lot
of people forget you know I am an indie
brand I'm not in any malls I'm not in
any stores which is a choice and I
wanted to stay ecommerce and I wanted to
have my business only online I
definitely like to have full control and
I don't want any corporations fucking
with my vision it's been a learning
experience just growing quickly and just
it's been I don't know I'm like
speechless because it's been such a
crazy blessed amazing year so I wanted
to end it with a bang and in today's
video I'm gonna be swatching all seven
actually there's eight and I'm sure a
lot of you were like oh oh there is
seven holiday liquid lips and I also
have my first ever metallic shade which
I Bute in my tattoo Diaries a few weeks
ago it is a crazy Barbie pink which
you'll see later on and that will be
launching on Cyber Monday so unlike my
holiday collection the pink metallic
shade will come in my standard pink
Barbie unit carton and boom this is it
this
shade is called dream house and I wore
this in a few videos and so many people
were like oh my god when is that coming
out and I wasn't really loving my
metallic formula so I'm sure if you guys
know wait earlier on in the year I gave
a few sneak peeks of other shades now I
didn't love the formula and I can never
put out anything that is half-ass or
that isn't perfect from my standards
so the peachy gold metallic one that
everyone saw floating all over the
internet it will definitely be coming
out early next year I'm sure you're all
like but this one I finally perfected
the formula it is unreal stunning
blinding and metallic as fuck so this
will be coming out exclusively on my
website for Cyber Monday which I'm
really excited for back to the holiday
collection I am about to swatch all
seven of these but I want to kind of
break it down for you guys I know that
there are a lot of new subscribers and a
lot of new customers this year so first
of all there are seven now last year I
did five but this year you know what I'm
like you know I need to put out a few
more there will be seven limited edition
liquid lips and they all come in this
beautiful cherry red packaging and the
caps are very um red a few quick things
that I want everyone to know about these
is that they will obviously be sold
individually for $18 just like the
regular ones but there will be a special
bundle with all seven shades that would
be 99 and 99 so you definitely get a
really good deal so if you want to snag
all seven you will definitely be able to
do that and this entire collection - the
cyber monday pink lip will be launching
on Black Friday which is November 25th
and it's not just any old day it is my
brand's two-year anniversary I just
can't believe it I'm like oh like the
time has gone by so fast and we're gonna
be celebrating our two year anniversary
or birthday a type of thing so all the
liquid lips and the bundle will be
coming out on Black Friday November 25th
as well as two as well as two limited
edition skin frost highlighting powders
which we are going to show you and
swatch in this video oh my god girl
when I show you these highlighters y'all
are gonna be shook to the core now just
to refresh your memory
my entire brand is vegan it is
cruelty-free and I only use
top-of-the-line ingredients so besides
that I think it's time to get my sister
over here my pink sister-in-law and
we're about to swatch everything for you
so y'all ready
oh hi guys so this is one of my really
good friends Nikita dragon my pink
sister she's my daughter
I've never told you guys about her
before but listen I was 16 a long time
ago so I brought Nikita here not only
because we are about to swatch eight
liquid lips but you guys Nikita is
basically like a brand ambassador for
Jeffrey store cosmetics and this holiday
season she is one of the faces of the
campaign I'm actually gonna show them a
few pictures right now and he just saw
them for the first time like a few hours
ago and right yes she's on her period
all here is a few images of the campaign
oh look at that hair look at that makeup
girl I guess we're serving like I don't
know what are we serving goddess and
then here is a picture of me solo BAM
come on with that gold cap I can't
breathe I mean shout-out to my makeup
artist lipstick NIC you fucking killed
it for the holidays shoot and I just I I
can't even so basically everyone is
waiting for us to shut our mouths and
get to revealing his colors alright so
when you look at all these shades what
do you gravitate you first like I want
to swatch one that your eyes want first
wicked of mine huh just way on the table
and they were like a right bitch
thank you you have to go with this one
yes okay you guys this is a dark IV sexy
green and her name is crocodile tears I
love that you went for this first way I
was like I was trying to but I'm over
here like yes so at the shoot that we
did Nikita only wore two colors I had a
bunch of models in myself so we all wore
different ones so you haven't even worn
most of these oh well what is in this
baby juice in this Beach okay people
about smells because a lot of my nudes
smell like root beer so this holiday
season there is some actually had the
shimmer and glitter in them which we're
about to dive into but the ones that do
not have a faint cotton candy smell I
died which is really cute right so it's
not overpowering so a lot of them are my
old cotton candy oh wait before we even
swatch this I do want to say one thing
that I actually improved my packaging
and what I mean by that is that it's
more airtight and it's more sturdy so do
you feel how it's a little like click it
kuna you could get any tighter baby it's
a little more on it like on it yeah and
it's a little more tight so come on baby
this time alright let's put her on
all right here is crocodile tears dried
how are you feeling about it honey um
I'm actually feeling like I need to go
rob a bank sick Oh so last year I put
out a green shade called mistletoe and
it's been a year now since that came out
so everyone's like are you gonna bring
it back this year so I switched it up
did a darker some more seductive you
know version of that one and here's what
happened so I'm like feeling it I'm like
feeling myself I'm over here having my
own music video rope fuzz now if they're
afraid of dark lips what should they do
shut the bug up and right alright so the
next shade and they were about to do boo
it is that one called deceased hi
hashtag deceased hashtag cremated
hashtag hi so weird I never heard of
this one until you started using it hi
now this is a really pretty
mob nude it is gorgeous it's like it's
like a Scorpio had a little sister this
would be her you ready just watch her
I'm like ready diving in yeah
and here is deceased dry I'm looking in
the monitor like oh it's I don't know I
don't know like I just needed this in my
collection I feel like it was missing
and I feel like any skin tone can wear
this I mean this is like an everyday lip
for me yeah I like it's very universal
this is one of my favorites I think from
the collection since we are in the
holiday season I had to name this next
liquid lip after one of my favorite
desserts so this shade is called pumpkin
pie Braille now if you can see on the
zoom in this has little fine Mika's of a
glitter inside of it so this was
inspired by my favorite dessert I love
the holiday season and I'm a pumpkin pie
whore so this just uh represents my love
for that this is pumpkin pie dry I love
it with my eye look I'm like mmhmm yeah
it's really thickening this is
definitely more on the safer side even
though it's a little different and
unique shade I think everyone should be
able to pull this off and embrace it
when you rub it it kind of activates the
glitter more see that are you living it
is magic so you just take your finger
preferably the middle one okay and just
kind of rub gently like don't read like
I try and take it off but oh are you
living it's cool right so it's like when
you're like kissing someone and she's
like yes alright look at the next one
the next shade is one of my favorites I
think it is the darkest and the
collection biome this one is called
designer blood Lum now listen you want
unicorn blood a lot I was just about to
ask what is the difference unicorn blood
is one of your go tubes right my first
short coat it looks a little similar in
the bottle but let me tell you when this
is swatch on your mouth definitely
different and we're about to insert a
little swatch comparison now unicorn
blood is literally I think in my top
three best sellers of all time and
sister I live for I live
for a good unicorns life so this was
inspired by that and I wanted to give it
a little slight twist because we all
know I'm a designer whore and it's like
your blood looks exactly so you know a
little plan worth to have fun but um so
when this dries down mm-hmm and it's
completely dry and matte it has this
weird shift of like a gold tone stop
that it's hard to like explain until
you're about to watch and see it but
it's like unicorn blood when it's dry is
like rusty dark dark red this one just
has a little bit of a little huh to it
and it's slightly darker so so what your
lab you want you're like I want a little
uh shade I told the chemist I want a
little Oh
all right let's watch this bad boy
if you guys don't get any presents for
whatever holiday you celebrate and
you're wondering where all the little
magical elves are huh that this bitch is
this color on you I'm looking in the
monitor a leg fuck Oh
so once it dries it gets that light
machine and hopefully you guys can tell
on camera
all right let's watch the next one the
next shade is I think the lightest of
the collection it is a soft pale pinkish
kind of warm toned nude and it has fine
Mika's of glitter and is Mike baby yeah
and she looks a little something like
this
boom so this shade is called
chrysanthemum when I was younger at my
grandma rest in peace right here on my
neck she would cover the entire house
with chrysanthemums when it was the
holiday time so it definitely reminded
me of her and she loved wearing really
soft nude colors so some prints so let's
give her a little world
this is chrysanthemum dried I actually
love it on you more than me not gonna
lie no for real I'm like yeah it looks
so good I mean you're so golden and
bronzed and like your skin tone is so
beautiful and I'm just like but I'm you
it's like a like a such a soft whisper
really soft like if you're just ready to
go in the beach for a soft picnic and
maybe gaping this could be this is a
really like going to church and
celebrating life in love and you know
being on your knees
gong did it thank you babe you did it
for her my guys they come on my jackets
like boy your life so in between takes
we've been diving into the jeffree star
cosmetics it's somewhat obscure ah oh
yeah I'm gonna sugar I like yes if you
guys have never checked these out
shameless plug they exfoliate they have
vitamin E they're edible they're vegan
and there's aloe vera in them and oh
when I look so amazing now so next shade
is I'm sure everyone was like it's
Christmas we're is like the red type of
vibe besides a designer blood which is
very dark red I had to create something
that was a little loud a little
obnoxious and a little a little bright
boom this shade is called checkmate
guess who named this who Nathan you're
lying
no like when I was trying out when I was
like what do you think a cool name would
be to help me name it and he came up
with check me and I was like that's kind
of okay I'm like okay all the other ones
right I'm like joint your own brand just
kidding so this is kind of similar to
one of my shades called Anna Nicole I'm
sure you guys are looking at like looks
a little Anna Nicole E it is darker way
darker and you'll see in a second it's a
lot more vibrant and it has like a
darker tone though like dark but right
at the same time
here is checkmate brigham dried
checkmate baby no tell me what you're
saying a second ago okay like just
looking at this I wouldn't be like okay
have her grab it
I just think oh whatever like that's not
for me like I could never pull that off
I literally just put it on right now and
I'm just like hi it's cool on me I think
we all kind of get stuck in our own like
rut of always worrying kind of the same
similar shades I mean obviously we love
what we love but I think we should try
stepping outside of the box a little
more sometimes and just giving it a
whirl
okay all right so we have one more
holiday shade to swatch for you guys and
then we're gonna swatch the Dreamhouse
pink metallic that's coming on Cyber
Monday
come on cyber I have a picture if
Scorpio and androgyny just had a baby
came together and you are going to get a
really gorgeous shade and she is called
Sagittarius Brian hi are you living the
other day oh I feel like this is gonna
be one of your favorites yeah I love
these times these are my favorite songs
ever
yeah drogyny she bathes and lives in
androgyny alright let's watch this bad
boy
all right here is Sagittarius dry I'm
living this is gonna be one of those
shades that people are like oh maybe and
then once they wear it they're only like
everything Oh or maybe they're all
watching a home like bitch we love it
shut your mouth shut your mouth on this
site remiss now I do want to say one
thing when you put deceased in
Sagittarius next to each other in the
bottle they do kind of look similar but
as you can see deceased is way more nude
and this one is way more like moggy
purple and also just because I know
you're all gonna ask I'm gonna insert a
swatch comparison right now here they
are of me putting them side-by-side so
you can definitely tell there's a
difference
all right guys so that was all 7 of the
holiday limited edition of velour liquid
lipsticks now we have one more liquid
lip to swatch this is the color of my
soul I think oh and I also made a
matching highlighter with it which we'll
talk about a second but this one is
called dream house it is my first ever
metallic liquid lip from my brand many
more to come by the way so let's take
this off and put this bitch oh I'm so
ready
all right here is Dreamhouse the way
that it like reflects off of light in
the Sun it's so shimmery and so like ah
alright guys so this shade will be
coming out separately it is a limited
edition item that will be available only
on Cyber Monday which will be cool on my
website and on Cyber Monday there is
free shipping high and also free
shipping on Black Friday
hi I'm sorry so actually all seven
shades and no shipping besides that
there is two skin Frost's that are
coming out on Black Friday as well it's
a Black Friday flowing light slow down a
few weeks ago I gave a sneak peak of my
highlighter which is called Regina
George and it looks something like this
it is literally hot pink oh he's kind of
go together yeah oh yeah literally
they're like the perfect match together
so this is coming out and then we all
leave please comment like I have another
shade coming out it is a icy baby pink
shade and she is called a princess cut
whoa when you swatch this you're gonna
gag it is so pretty
oh it's basically if ice cold went pink
for the holidays you sneeze on it yeah
basically basically now this looks
flawless over blush it does have some
pigment to it of course so you can wear
it by itself you can put it over like as
a blush topper you can actually if you
have like a regular lip you can take
some and put on the top of the lip only
thing about this guy is because my brand
is vegan now you have to use special
like red dyes and pigments yeah so
Regina George is the only skin frost
that is not eye safe okay yes okay so
what that means is I still put it on my
eyes so if you put it on your eyes or
your lids it's not like it's gonna burn
or do anything crazy it just stains your
skin yes and then that's pretty much
everything look that's a bad but legally
you have to put out that warning and I
would never want people to like yeah
have a stained lid and be like what the
fuck
so a lot of times you know we've use
other brands that their lipsticks wipe
it off and you're staying yes
I'm sick for a while yeah exactly which
is normal but some people don't want
their
Aylin stain which I totally get so I
think we should do a few finger swatches
and if you don't mind I'm gonna put a
little princess cutting maybe I'd be
honored
yes all right so here is a Regina and
George I am oh it looks so pretty
oh are you living here it is on me I am
a really pale so this is gonna look
really fun am i cool this is beautiful I
thought it would be like more of like
crazy like just in your face he's not
yeah so it's like literally like a
highlight and almost like a blush in one
if you wanted to get that way but um
yeah it's not as intense as people I
think we're first thinking all right now
this is princess cut girl biome
oh my god it is really blinding and it's
Rick oh no it's like really like it's
like not really baby pink yes it's so
subtle
he's baby pink oh my god like break me
my almond like ready yeah we'll put it
on me there we go it is excuse me I had
lip swatches all over my hands earlier
but there is um princess kata it's
balaiah near my cup or camera or any new
lens so I'm gonna be applying the
highlighter with my favorite morphe 510
brush use code dragon with the huge join
online yeah I don't firstly have a
morphe code or any code at olive so I
always encourage you guys to use my
friends I'm gonna put princess cut on
your cheeks and then a little Regina
because why not
oh that's blinding Wow I know it's a
little extreme no I live oh I live I
thought this was like a subtle do like I
just walked oh hell no so I'm wearing a
mixture of peach goddess and ice cold
but I'm like you know what I'm gonna put
a little princess cut on this bitch oh
it's like glass on my cheeks baby now
I'm gonna take a fan brush from morphe
this is the 310 the other one was the
510 maybe I said it wrong fuck it okay
now this one you can be really subtle
with the fan brush of course this is
more for really highlighting this one is
more for like a little a little soft
dusting
so I'm gonna put this on the high plains
of her cheekbones and not all the way at
the base is what we like to call it stop
trying to make fetch happen be go fetch
you go Glen Coco you fuck oh that's
really pretty yeah it's like it's not
too crazy it's just a windy night it's
really like not like it's all about
having handed people are I think Regina
George could look amazing on anyone it
is so versatile and fun so I think if
you're down to take a little risk this
one's gonna be perfect for you all right
