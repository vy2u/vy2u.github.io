channel
hi now today we are finally going to be
revealing the jeffree star cosmetics
holiday 2017 collection we are going to
swatch everything we're gonna play
around we're gonna do the entire reveal
and show you everything that I've been
cooking up now I know the big elephant
in the room no not my ass it's this
mirror now this mirror is coming out in
early December so this is like it's not
a part of the exact launch with all the
makeup but it is something coming before
Christmas so these are in production
I've been working on these for like six
months I've been designing them and
changing them the different weights I
was like okay this can't be too heavy it
can't be too light we gotta meet in the
middle has to be a perfect star the
local has to be amazing
also little JSC logo right there and of
course when you spin it around you do
get a very big mirror that fits your
face I mean hi now I'm tired compact and
I just wanted my own mirror now there is
hot pink there's baby pink and a few of
my retailers will actually be getting
other colors that will not be on my site
but we'll talk about that later but I'm
long story short these are $20 alright
you guys let's get into what everyone
wants to talk about these getting Frost
pro pilots we are also going to be
swatching every lip shade in the holiday
collection BAM and yeah I think we
should stop running our mouths and get
to swatching so if you want to see
everything revealed then keep on
watching alright you guys so we all know
and love these skin Frost they look like
this well here's a limited edition one
and I have had this product since last
year so they have been around for like
two years now and I always wanted
something really big and just kind of
like a showstopper so when I created
this formula I was like okay the
packaging has to be like a BAM
so I did a very large pan of course most
of you have seen and playing with these
I thought to myself alright let's let's
hear what the customers have to say and
we have been getting a lot of feedback
that's like Jeffrey I love your skin
frost formula but I want to travel with
like six or seven colors and the problem
is they are so damn heavy if you put six
in your luggage so here we are with a
travel friendly palette so we have two
versions of the of course skin frost Pro
palettes now we have 24 karat gold
and we have bam platinum ice now of
course you see the unit cartons they
look like brushed metal I love how this
came out now of course a lot of you are
gonna say what is the difference so
let's dive into it 24 karat is focusing
on all the gold tones it is perfect for
medium to dark skin tones anyone on
earth can wear this palette there is a
shade for everyone now I do want to note
that the pro palettes do have two
existing shade plus four brand new ones
so of course that is in the Platinum as
well so we're gonna just open it up and
see what the hell is going on so let's
open her up this is what the palette
looks like so when you open her up whoa
you do get a cover that comes over the
powder so they do not get ruined in
transit and there's also a plastic piece
that is over the mirror that you peel
off like more you know like most normal
palettes now let's get into the shades
now you will note that King Tut and Dark
Horse are both previous shades that I've
already put out oh my god if you are
someone with like a medium skin tone
King Tut is going to be your best friend
and if you were someone with a little
bit of a darker skin tone or really dark
dark horse and Giza are going to be
flawless on your cheeks and you're going
to blind everyone now I do want to note
that of course you're gonna probably
look at these two and be like whoa I
promise they look a little scary but
they are very wearable so first off we
have a sarcophagus I'm just gonna touch
these and ruin the pans because that's
what we're here for so let's take some
clean fingers and we're just going to go
like this oh they're so creamy so
sarcophagus is a blinding champagne ice
color where it's gonna do a little
swatch right here if you will and she is
really like BAM it's like a lighthouse
on your cheekbones next up we have King
Tut if you've never seen it's watched
before let's swatch and then of course
we will do Dark Horse now Dark Horse I
have been using as eyeshadow because it
is such a stunning color it's that one
right there
so first let's do King Tut BAM and then
we will do Dark Horse Dark Horse is such
a pretty topaz like Oh
of it now we are going to move on to the
bottom row and now we are going to dive
into legendary Giza and Liberace now
legendary is a beautiful peach color
really buttery and creamy so be careful
a little goes a long way so let me just
swatch this right on my hand oh girl I'm
like hi and I've been putting this
actually on like lipsticks as well I
love playing highlighter on liquid lips
now Giza let's dive into her this shade
is so stunning Oh hmm here is Giza BAM
oh I died the sixth and final shade in
the 24 karat gold palette is called
Liberace she is a stunning blinding
yellow gold color I'm gonna take this
finger and just do a little one too it's
so pretty now this color is bull lining
a lot of you saw me wear this on
snapchat I put it all over my lid on set
the other day and it just looks so cool
look at that color
oh very um now I know a lot of people
are gonna say that looks a lot like
fenty beauty trophy wife because I wore
dove my lids and a lot of people thought
it was that I'm definitely gonna do a
swatch comparison right now so I have no
questions
they are definitely very different I'm
actually gonna hold them up together
no Fenty's is very sparkly full of
glitter and it's very gold mine is more
like a crazy hybrid of like yellow neon
mixed with gold so they are very
different so let me just swatch that and
here is the comparison here is Liberace
here is the Fenty trophy wife and I'm
also gonna put it next to mine just so
you can really see that how glittery and
crazy theirs are and mine is just very
icy so they are very different I just
feel like I have to put that in there
because I know so many people will ask
for comparison so fenty I live for you
but mama has the different highlights so
this wraps up the 24 karat palette I am
so happy with this I hope you guys loved
the packaging the broquet on here with
the gold on gold I live for it and I
can't wait to see this in your guys's
collection alright let's move on to the
platinum ice
now let's dive into the platinum ice
palate now this one is very weird it's
very icy it has some crazy colors so if
you were someone that is a little more
on the creative side this palette will
definitely be for you so let's open her
up and here is what you get inside
platinum ice and of course the cover is
full of diamond-cut pattern it is very
blinding so once you open her up you of
course take out the plastic and here is
the other plastic I was showing you guys
for the mirror there we go now the
mirror is a very fresh here is what it
looks like we have ice cold and lavender
snow from the previous line and we have
four new shades as you see Glacier alien
ice pink chill and canary bling now I do
want to note that five shades are the
exact same formula that you guys love
and know but one shade is kind of like a
highlighter topper it is a different
formula than I've ever put out before
and that is pink chill so it was a
little more on the sheer side I know a
lot of you were like sheer jeffree star
sheer not everyone wants a blinding
highlight and I do understand that so
besides the weird colors which you will
see in a second this one has more of
like a glitter moment where it's just
kind of like you want to dust it on you
just kind of want to do a little glow on
the go and not be so in-your-face
blinding this is gonna be for you let's
dive into the swatches ice cold is a
blinding icy color oh it's just so
creamy I'm looking at it like mmm so
here's ice cold it is a very icy and
high blinding the second shade is called
glacier this is like your Silver Surfer
Marvel x-men moment oh I died for this
color all right now glacier is very
silver it is a little more intense and a
very silver compared to ice cold
alright now moving on in the top right
we have lavender snow which is a very
icy lavender moment it looks a little
dark on the pan but on the finger it
actually comes off as a more like icy
lavender shea
so let's watch her BAM there she is a
very reflective mmm
I think this might be my favorite color
and the palette this one is called alien
ice alien ice is of course you guys can
tell has a green shift to it it is
really pretty I've been wearing it
secretly and a few of you have clocked
me online but hey you know mama couldn't
tell our secrets yet and here is what
alien ice looks like you see how it has
that really cool icy green type of feel
to it I am pink chill is more of the of
course highlighter topper vibes but I am
going to a poor swatch it there it is
right there on my finger let's swatch
her right here so as you can see as you
zoom in it does have really pretty pink
reflex there's some glitter in there
which my beauty lights are kind of not
showing off the best but you guys can
see it has a really cool shift to it's
almost borderline duochrome
but I live for it the last shade it is a
really cool I see yellow color it is
called canary bling and let's show you
guys what she looks like
mmm I die I'm like hi now this color is
not for the faint of heart it is a very
blinding and high I love this palette I
think we should of course put a few
colors on my cheeks and what are we
gonna do today let's use the morphe Y 14
I love this brush and we're gonna go
into the 24 karat palette and we are
going to dip into sarcophagus just a
little one two three and let's put her
right on the cheekbones now I love this
one because it gives you kind of like
that wet cheek appearance so as you see
all of a sudden my whole face has like a
different type of light to it I am going
to now take a little bit of sarcophagus
and just do the tip of my nose Oh
now let's dip into the platinum ice
palette now let's do I'm gonna take the
same brush and we are going to just do a
little bit of pink chill we're right on
top and just kind of pack her on know
I'm not sure how well this is showing on
camera
but this is gonna give you a more
blinding effect and just a little bit
more dimension to your cheek so if you
were someone that's not afraid to blind
people
there you go and now we are going to dip
into what should we do a little bit of
canary bling let's do it we're just
going to do a little one two three now
let's take the cheeks and let's see what
happens
BAM and there you have it oh all right
got my gloss off and now we are ready to
do some swatches so in the Holiday
Collection here is what the unit cartons
look like they are all crazy holographic
and what is inside a lot of pure glitter
madness now I don't mean glitter liquid
lips
I mean glitter packaging and I'm really
excited to finally show you everything
inside the component so in the Holiday
Collection there are eight liquid lips
and four lip ammo so we're gonna start
swatching now remember these will retail
for eighteen dollars as well as the
regular lip ammo lip stick so both are
18 now there are a few metallics we got
it like one nude but I really wanted to
do something different because I have
beginning so many requests to do a dark
teal we got some Gray's we have some
berries and some wine colors and just
different colors that I've personally
never created before it was time to go a
little bit left and try something new so
I think we should just dive right into
it the first color that I showed online
was mermaid blood and this color you
guys oh my god one of my favorites I
think I've ever created once you open up
the box here's what the lipstick looks
like we have full glitter I do want to
tell you guys one thing that was a
little crazy in production that getting
glitter that does not feel gritty or
like sandpaper was very difficult so
I've been working on this for months and
it's finally here it feels so smooth
it's like glass and the plastic is a
very of course sturdy you don't feel
anything in his seamless and girl it was
a chore but it came out so beautiful and
I'm so proud of this so let's get to
swatching ooh girl
now this may be one of my favorite
shades from the collection is just
something very different for me and hi
with this eye makeup alright let's watch
the next color we are going to do let's
do point sedia this one is a straight up
holiday metallic red it is like mmm
looks like foil on your mouth so let's
see what she looks like
Oh
here's poinsettia yeah dry I think I'm
like this is my favorite color no
mermaid blood was this is such a fun
holiday color if you're someone that
just loves reds which who the fuck
doesn't love a red lipstick it is a very
vibrant and look so pretty when the
light hits it it just gives us really
cool like foil reflection and I'm living
the next shade is called berries on ice
and look at that shade this is a color
that I have never made before I
attempted to last year a little darker
version of this and it just didn't work
out so if you were newer to my brand my
formula is vegan it is paraben free it
is cruelty free and when you do a vegan
formula you cannot use a lot of
ingredients that make Reds easier right
so if you are trying to perfect the
formula it is so difficult when you are
using just red pigments so this shade
took a lot of work there is another one
that I'm just gonna mention right now
called Santa Baby and it looks like this
it is a really dark like very red and
this is a more magenta color now they
are very different of course you can see
it right there but these two were very
hard to make because of the red pigment
so they do apply a little bit more I
hate the word streaky but you do or
might need two layers I'm you know me
I'm always a very upfront about
everything
so to get a full beautiful application
well you'll see in a second you do need
like a little bit of another layer to
make the color fucking like BAM so let's
swatch berries on ice
here's the color dried down now of
course you sided but nested a little bit
more than I normally would but the color
is beautiful and I'm so happy that the
shade finally it turned out good because
sometimes when you were in the makeup
lab when you were creating and you get
frustrated you just kind of kind of put
the idea to the side and move on so I'm
glad that I came back and revisited this
this color is stunning
the next shade is a very dark nude it is
kind of like androgyny stepsister and it
is called human nature it is in the same
family it may look a little similar in
the bottle but on the mouth oh my god
this one is perfect for the fall and
winter season girl I think you guys are
gonna really love this one
all right here is human nature dried
down mwah I love the shade it is giving
me dark plum mauve nude vibes and I'm
obsessed
now the next shirt has been highly
requested by you guys and it is
literally a pure gold metallic lip now
this shade is called first class and it
is blinding and very metal looking I've
been getting so many tweets for the last
few months that please make a gold
please make a gold girl I got you so
let's swatch her down
here is first class fully so watched I
have been obsessed with gold everything
lately so hopefully you guys will be too
the next color is the perfect holiday
nude and the shade is called Christmas
cookie it is literally the color of
fresh-baked cookies in the oven this
color is in between a mannequin and
celebrity skin yes it is a new nude it
is not a repeat you know I repeat no
damn colors it is a little similar but
if you're someone that loves a nude lip
pair this with a liner aware it by
itself throw some gloss over and girl
you are good to go
now these seventh out of eight we are
almost down to the finish line for
liquid lips this color is a hybrid of a
blue and a grey like if they had a baby
and here she is the shade is called
Medusa now definitely inspiration from
watching all these crazy Lord of the
Rings and Game of Thrones shows and
movies where there's just crazy
creatures everywhere so I actually have
a lip mo shade called gargoyle which we
will dive into that in a second but
gargoyle and Medusa are Grey's and this
is my version of a gray but gargoyle is
a very true grey which you'll see in a
second but Medusa is a very unique color
something in that this brand has not put
out before so let's watch her whoa girl
here is Medusa dried down I think I'm
gonna be living and breathing in this
color all fucking holiday season all
right you guys we have one more of a
lower liquid lip to swatch final volu
liquid lipstick shade is called scent of
baby of course we mentioned this one
earlier when we were talking about
berries on ice now this color is the
second shade where it might need another
layer or a tiny bit of finessing here is
Santa baby
here's sent a baby dried down now we are
about to dive into the lip ammunition
but there was all eight velour liquid
lipsticks of course sound off down below
in the comment section and let me know
what your favorite shade was from that
so we're about to dive into the lip ammo
now as I mentioned there are four shades
now if you have been a fan of this brand
for a while you will remember the first
lip ammunition shade was called the
beauty pageant which was a soft glitter
that had a little bit of a shift to it
it is more of like a something like a
top where you would put on normal
lipsticks right so that shade was of
course it still isn't for sale
but I thought hey let's make a different
version so the first lip ammo shade is a
glitter the other three are the normal
satin formula now this shade is called
champagne tears and it is a straight-up
champagne glitter it is so pretty I'm
gonna do a little swatch on my hands so
you guys can see how it looks just by
itself it is a very icy and it has this
really crazy glitter to it so I'm just
gonna use this as an example you can
literally just take this and oh a even
just right in the center it gives that
really pretty look let's do a little bit
up here mm-hmm
now I'm gonna leave the side parts blank
and just kind of blend it in mm-hmm so
pretty so if you want to add a little
bit of festivity to your lips or just a
little bit of flare these are really
good for that this formula but of course
if you want to wear it by itself it will
look really blinding all right you guys
I am going to swatch the other three lip
mo right here on my hand my mouth is
like dying first of all I had a root
canal the other day so I'm already
having a little bit of pain over here
from the procedure but my mouth you guys
is raw so we are going to do quick
little swatches over right here now I'm
just gonna go ahead and say it I had to
make the shade it has been a highly
requested one of my top selling Reds
ever in the liquid lip formula is Red
Rum so I made a lip ammo
version so of course most of you are
very aware of the shade Red Rum but if
you're not it is the perfect blue based
classic red and here is what she looks
like
it is of course nothing crazy about it
it is straight-up red and I am obsessed
now remember these retail for $18 and
these have a creamsicle yummy scent I'm
hungry now the next shade we mentioned
earlier when we were talking about
Medusa is gargoyle now this is literally
a slate straight-up gray something that
has been highly requested as well that I
have never made yet so we are going to
just do a little soul watcher right
there BAM now this formula is so creamy
as you can see one swipe coverage I'll
add a little bit more so the swatches
look a little bit more there we go they
can't erupt so that shade is literally
just straight-up gray and I'm living for
it the last lip ammunition shade in the
holiday collection is a beautiful brown
terra cotta and the shade is called
allegedly I think this one is such a
pretty nude for the holidays here is
what she looks like it is so creamy I'm
like oh that's so soft yummy that is
what that shade looks like excuse my
swatches you guys sorry I went a little
ham on that last one it is a really cool
little foursome so we got the glitter we
got the gray we got the red and we got
the terra cotta here are all of the lip
munitions
now the final products the V Holiday
Collection are lip scrubs which are such
a crazy product for my brand Ness like
it's something I don't really promote
heavily but they sell insane summer the
blue raspberry and the watermelon gum
flew off the shelves and sold out so I
have also brought those back I'm just
gonna sneak that and go in there those
are actually available right now on my
website they are finally back but moving
along to a new flavors for the holiday
season what the hell did I cook up you
guys here are all three flavors now I
just got to show you the component
because oh my god the glitter looks so
pretty and the lip scrub jar I am living
for how this turned out so here is what
the jar looks like full glitter now the
first flavor is called lemon icebox
cookies oh my god this
this said this shade this flavor is so
yummy all you got to do is take a little
bit on your finger take some out rub it
all over your mouth these are edible
there is aloe vera in here it is infused
with the vitamin E and it just leaves
her skin so soft all over your mouth and
I've even heard people have taken this
and put it on their dry patches of their
face remember laganja told me she used
all over her face one day and she was
like saying it was so spectacular so if
you have any dry spots take a little bit
out stand her down baby but lemon ice
box cookies is so delicious I'm like
yummy if the second flavor is a
straight-up holiday classic which I've
never done before and that is candy cane
so if you're someone that loves mint
anything you're gonna die for this one
it literally tastes like a candy cane
fresh from the wrapper like in your
mouth oh hi I did like baby pink sugar
for this one because I thought it would
just be really pretty and not just to do
like the same for all of them I love
changing up the sugar colors so oh my
god opens up my sinuses mmm yummy now
last but not least the third and final
flavor is marshmallow it literally is
just straight-up marshmallows out of the
bag and in your mouth this tastes so
good I'm very into desserts and sugar
I'm sure you guys are aware by now by
watching this channel so yeah here all
three you guys we got lemon ice box we
got candy cane and we got marshmallow I
really love these they're different than
what we've done before and I hope you
guys like them too wow I can't believe

little shook all right you guys now
