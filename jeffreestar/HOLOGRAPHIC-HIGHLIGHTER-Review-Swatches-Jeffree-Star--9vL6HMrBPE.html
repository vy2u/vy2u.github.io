channel today we're gonna dive into
something brand new now in Sephora there
is a new brand called milk makeup it's
been around for I think most of this
year I've seen a lot of youtubers review
some of their lipsticks and their eye
stuff but then but then I log on to
Sephora calm and what do I see on the
front page a holographic highlighter I
was like like I really couldn't breathe
so melk is a brand from New York and
they have some really cool innovative
stuff I heard a lot of good and bad
reviews about all their products so I
was like you know what I need to get my
hands on one of these and give it a
whirl myself alright so beome here it is
this is the holographic stick this shade
is called a supernova
now the packaging is really cute it
comes in like a just a plastic like
little unicorn that you pop the lid off
oh and the shade name is on top if you
could see that the lights and the
hologram is just blinding now there is
this guy and then there is another one
that is a highlighter stick of course
you guys know I got to try both today
but this is like the star of the show
for me
so you just BAM pop it off right here
now it does have the ingredients on the
bottom which is cool and on the side of
this it has just a little a little
tidbit this says a multi-use
illuminating stick that instantly melts
into skin using milk melt technology
that's a tongue twister holographic
pearls provide a prismatic finish
infused with mango butter peach nectar
avocado oil and meteorite dust
that's cute it just says apply to
cheekbones lips and eyes can be applied
to bare skin or over makeup now
disclaimer I know a lot of times when I
put in creams over this crazy foundation
powder blush contour I'm wearing
everything today except highlighter and
my blush I use NARS orgasm which kind of
has a sheen to it which I should
probably know from using
for ten years so if there's a little
doing this on my cheeks it is from this
blush but I'm not wearing a highlighter
today now this product contains one
ounce of highlighter and it retails for
$28 so it is a little on the pricey side
but when you compare this to other
brands like Becca
or Estee Lauder or other brands that
have highlighters this is it's not that
bad for the price point and you get a
lot of product I'm like I might put this
under my arms on my chest on my
vagina let's just see what happens here
now I'm gonna apply a little bit to my
hand first to see what happens just I
can see the consistency huh Oh y'all see
that drew oh wow
and it's really shiny oh my god this is
like really pretty let's see if it
translates on the skin now the cool
thing about this product is that it is
vegan and cruelty free and it is paraben
free and sulfate free so this has some
good ingredients I can't stop looking at
my head I'm like okay now usually when I
apply things directly on sometimes it
kind of like coagulate the foundation
and gets weird not saying that this one
does that but we're gonna put it to the
test so it says that you could literally
just go directly on I think I'm
definitely going to try that with one
side of my face and I might use a little
synthetic brush to apply it that's what
I normally do but let's just dive in
alright so I'm just going to take this
guy
and bam oh okay I see that I'm looking
at my monitor like now but look right
off the bat my foundation came off on
the stick because this is kind of like a
more greasy light texture this is what I
was afraid of so if you see one swipe
kind of took my foundation off which I
wear a mask so I'm like so I'm going to
take a little synthetic brush this is a
Mac one two five nine and I am just
going to rub this all on the brush and
get it coated and then we're gonna go
back in one more time with this I'm just
going to kind of Pat it and buff it into
the skin all right I am just gonna Pat a
little bit more on top to get the full
coverage now it does feel kind of greasy
not oily it just feels kind of like
tacky so definitely it is kind of moving
around my foundation now it says you can
put on top of makeup but hmmm alright
let me just take this a little bit above
my brow cuz we're getting full on today
give it a little head turn so this is a
side with no highlighter and this is the
full shebang ooh still tacky a little
bit came off on my finger so it
definitely has not set yet I don't know
if it does set I guess we'll see you in
a minute
um I'm also gonna try just taking some
on my finger and I'm just gonna go let's
try to highlight this nose baby oh wow
way more subtle than I thought
uh-huh well it's cute yeah it's really
tacky which I don't love but it
definitely is pretty as you see my
cheeks are like glistening right now so
I'm gonna give this five minutes to see
if it dries down and I'll be right back
alright guys so this has not dried down
I think because it is more of like a
tacky consistency it's not going to dry
it down now other brands that have
similar products I usually set it with
more highlighter so this is almost like
a good base for adding on more highlight
if you want which we will do in a second
but I definitely want to try the stick
highlighter so this is the hologram
version and this one
just says highlighter this instantly
melts into the skin same thing as the
hologram one and this shade is called
lit speaking of lit one second all right
oh look what JD's does alright so same
packaging as the other one I just
unscrewed the top now this one well this
looks like a champagne color so I'm just
going to take this on my hand just like
I did the other one and just kind of go
back and forth a few times
ooh okay definitely a more like kind of
champagne e nudie glow that is very
pretty okay see you so this definitely
feels like the hologram one kind of like
a bomb it's sticky I'm gonna put this
over my shoes and see what happens
what's up girls put this on your hand
I'm just gonna rub it all over oh I
gotta say it smells really good by the
way I'm like mmm edible this one is
definitely a lot more sheer than the
hologram side so I'm going to take the
same brush I'm just gonna rub that
hologram off and uh let's try this one
all right so I'm just gonna put this on
the high plains and my cheeks and just
kind of Pat it in definitely don't want
to smear around because god forbid it
Fox at the foundation again okay kind of
gives you that like glistened like just
had sex in the morning type of vibe I
think mad at it and then I'm just gonna
put it all the way up you guys know I'm
a high light ho gotta have that product
everywhere highlighting to me is like
that appetizer and the dessert on one
it's like contour go away this one is
definitely a lot not less pigmented it
just have like a different vibe almost
matches my skin tone it kind of looks
like I've been like in a sauna for a
minute God knows doing what okay cool
let me see if this one dries and I'll be
right back and just like this one this
one did not dry down so just for fun you
guys I'm gonna take out the UH Nastasia
moon child since it does have a little
hologram and the colors in here are
beautiful I'm just gonna set the face
with this and just see what happens so I
think purple horseshoe which is this guy
right here you guys know my favorite I
feel like if I set the hologram with
this
sighing it's gonna be a movie so let's
try it oh this is fire hmm oh my
god
okay this hologram stick like this is
such a sick base you guys see this
 cheek it's like a unicorn just
came on my face
woohoo now obviously if you're scared of
color or you don't like wearing anything
outside the box who's um wow oh my god
this is so cool oh my god this is like
this is makeup porn to me you guys it's
just putting this on is making me like
oh my god I'm close now this side let's
do Lucky Clover I used this in my neon
winged liner tutorial and I was obsessed
with it now let's just see how it looks
on this side oh definitely gives it some
more like depth and warmth I'm also
going to dip in a pink heart because now
I put on a lot of the stick on both
sides of course so I think the power is
really adhering to it like holy my
cheeks look like they can guide home
someone that's lost in space baby let's
dip into blue moon and just kind of
barely touch the nose there oh my god
okay Barney let's tone this down girl I
can't be like I said tone it down please
someone come over and slap me across my
face I can't stop looking at the side
you guys I'm like so how are you are you
doing girl it's so good to meet you okay
but really all right let's get down to
it guys let's talk about my final
thoughts my final thoughts on the melk
holographic stick and the highlighter
stick I think that they are amazing for
putting under a powder highlighter now
by itself I think it was not enough
pigment for me just because I like I
mean I'm a unique case
I love blinding glowing highlighter so I
feel like if you just want an extra
little ah to your makeup look and you
don't really wear 20 layers of
foundation like me this is perfect just
you know slide it on up those cheeks you
can also take a little bit
put it on your eye for just a little ad
in BAM it's really up to you if you are
a safe person or if you want that extra
extra extra glow but regardless I think
that these are really fun the price
point is and not that bad I love the
packaging it's sturdy it feels heavy
these are a good investment for people
that are just really into something
different these are really innovative
and cute and I can't wait to see what
this brand comes out with next so these
are definitely jeffree star approved I
think that adding on the powder
highlighters over it I mean this is
everything I just want to stare at
myself for a minute cut just kidding but
um I love it I think they're really fun
I love that more brands are diving into
you know just trying out things that
aren't conventional you know a lot of
the times people stick to the same thing
every brand has eyeliner to do that but
it's how you you know change your
formula and the presentation that sticks
out to someone like me that is been
buying makeup for so long I feel like
I've seen it all but as all these new
brands come out of the woodwork I'm like
damn there's some really cool stuff out
there so milk makeup I think I'm
definitely gonna be buying more of your
stuff to review and I'm a fan all right
now if you guys know of any of you
highlighters or if there's ever any new
stuff that you want me to try please
leave some comments below and send some
links my way I'm always down to try new
stuff and when I saw holographic I was
like who like I got excited like makeup
just makes me excited every day when I
wake up thank you guys so much for
watching this I had so much fun trying
this out I'm gonna go stare into the
mirror for a few minutes and go blind my
neighbor so I will see you all on the
next one bye guys mwah
