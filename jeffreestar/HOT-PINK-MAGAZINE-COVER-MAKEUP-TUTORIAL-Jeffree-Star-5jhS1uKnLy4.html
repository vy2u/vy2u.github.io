channel and if you're new what's up my
name is Jeffrey Starr and um hi
I have some really really exciting news
yesterday my cover of the Alternative
Press magazine finally came out oh I
I'm listen I am so honored and excited
to be on this cover BAM it looks like
this and I debuted on Instagram we
announced it a few weeks ago and the
support I got from everyone from my old
punk-rock days in the rock world to the
makeup world was so overwhelming and you
guys came really hard I know that hippy
magazine put up a lot of bundles with
liquid lipsticks if you guys sold out
all of them so I'm like ok y'all we play
in so I wanted to recreate the makeup
look for this cover it is very Jeffrey
like very it's very me we got the course
pink eyeshadow with a glitter and the
classic pink lip so I wanted to recreate
the fantasy for you all today now of
course - the wig and the tiara I am
really honored to be a part of this this
magazine is something I grew up reading
as a you know just a punk rock kid in
high school that really didn't fit in
and didn't know really where to fit in
and I found you know so many creative
outlets through music and makeup and
this magazine and definitely helped me
through some crazy times in my life just
to be a part of you know a scene that
accepted me for who I was so this is
definitely a huge honor to be part of
the AP a legacy and in the magazine you
guys there is a big feature so if you
want to see all the pictures of course
you can buy it now I was at Barbie you
can buy this directly from alt press com
on their website or you can find it in
stores so if you're not sure where to
get it
I definitely know that target has it
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Hot Topic and if you have
any other questions you can always go on
their website to see a store locator and
to where to find this thing but um this
will be in stores for the entire month
of October so if you want to see how I
created this look then keep on watching
first step is we're gonna prime the skin
with that Grill on
go the primer this is one of my
favorites and for photoshoots when
you're gonna wear a lot of makeup a full
coverage bitch you got to have a good
primer so I'm just gonna put this on
with my Gucci brush and let's go our
skin is ready to be snatched
now this primer really gives you that
like uplifting type of look so we're
just gonna let that settle in for a
moment and now let's get on to
foundation now for that full coverage
look we're gonna be going in with our
dior trusty air flash and this never
fails me for any photo shoot or video I
always start with this and then I'm
gonna mix in another foundation so let's
get to spraying I'm already feeling
airbrushed alright now we're gonna go in
with our Tom Ford traceless perfecting
foundation and this is a little shade
darker and I love to mix and match truly
give me a little more not bronzy but
just a little little darker cue because
a bitch is a vampire this
weekend so huh oh we're just gonna start
with a little bit of this hello do we
not want to talk about the bottles like
half done you guys and for everyone's
gonna be asking I am shade zero one
cream for this guy
and we'll just dot this all around the
face and see if I need any more there we
go
of course you know I can't forget the
Nick in the ears now let the buffing
blend
all right foundation is blended now
let's get to concealer for concealer
we're going to be going in with the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer and I
am shade fair neutral this is a
tried-and-true now when I did this shoe
the new Tarte shape tape concealer was
not out yet no shade to Urban Decay cuz
you know what I love that brand
but shape tape might be a hair better
than this I don't know I'm so I'm scared
to say that out loud but I don't know
who doesn't love a full face
now of course back again with that damn
Beauty Blender let's blend
our mask is almost there so now that the
concealer is done of course you guys
know a bitch needs the tried and true
trusty Mac shivering white Studio Fix
powder and we're of course going to go
in with my little JD weighty Alexi brush
we're gonna just dust this all under
these eyes and of course I'm going to go
in like an upside down triangle and
we're just going to snatch this face we
are almost almost done with this space
now for the rest of it we're going to go
in with our Georgia Armani luminous silk
compact and we're just going to take
this huge big fluffy lemare foundation
brush and we're just gonna dab it all
over there and every part that we didn't
highlight we're gonna go around with
this powder and just kind of going to
set and cover even more of this damn mug
now to finish the whole entire face and
set these under eyes we're going to go
into the little laura mercier
invisible Universal setting powder and
I'm just going to go in with the same
brush and just lightly Pat that in right
under my eyes ooh you almost want to go
inside your damn eyeball foundation and
everything else is done so let's get to
contouring now to chisel out these
cheekbones and face we're going to be
using the morphe highlight and contour
little palette the 9c if you will and
we're going to be using a little morphe
five to seven brush to apply this now I
like to mix and match so I'm going to be
going in with this shade right here and
I'll also be dipping into that guy a
little bit as well now these are really
pigmented so you just kind of want to
shake that brush off and let's go to
town now for this cover I did an extreme
nose contour so JD Wady also has this
cute little nose contour brush which I
love
so if you want a thin looking nose that
like bitch I can't brave you definitely
want to go in with this guy so this side
is really for carving out as well so
we're literally just gonna go BAM like
once people once and we're just gonna
take this and of course the smaller you
put the lines together the more pinched
your nose is gonna look so of course
we're gonna blend this out but just to
show it we're going in on this
oh it's getting hard to breathe mmm and
we're gonna put some on the sides to
create a little bit of a shadow and then
the tip we're gonna make it just
disappear
now we're gonna take the end of this
brush and I'm barely gonna tip in there
and we're just gonna softly start
buffing this out and now of course we're
going to take a Beauty Blender that we
already used and we're just gonna go
over these edges and we're really going
to diffuse a lot of them so this is
where it comes in really
Andy and we're just gonna blend it into
the skin so we don't look psycho anymore
now we're going to take this morphe e3
brush one more time and just with some
powder we're just gonna go and we're
gonna go over the nose and the forehead
because I can't stop blending as usual
voila our nose looks like we had a nose
job work
now let's highlight for highlighting I'm
going to be using two morphe brushes
today change changing let's roll
now this is the trusty 310 and this is
the 510 now I'm gonna start by going in
with my own jeffree star cosmetics skin
frost in shade peach goddess this is one
that I love to mix with and right where
that highlight and contour are meeting
we're just gonna add in this bitch and
have a threesome now you're gonna want
to take this brush and just lightly go
over the brow bone of course I don't
have eyebrows and we'll be drawing those
in in a second now we're going to take a
little bit more of peach goddess and hit
that Cupid's bow now we're gonna take a
tiny bit and just dot it on the tip of
our nose ooh it's like a beacon of light
and hope y'all there we go now of course
are we done highlighting bitch of course
we're not we're gonna go in with ice
cold the lightest shade in my line it is
like a platinum white gold and we're
gonna be going in with the five ten more
feet and just putting that right on top
of peach goddess and mixing it this is
for that extra blinding glam whoo I
think we are highlighted to death right
now so I'm gonna quickly draw on some
brows off-camera and I'll be right back
now that the browser on I'm looking a
little bit more human now because we're
gonna be doing some bright eye shadows
today we're gonna be starting off with
the Urban Decay potion eyeshadow primer
this is in what is this one called this
is enigma my favorite one I just love to
just put a little bit on my lids and
then you can of course blend in it with
a finger and of course if you have
4-inch diamond fingernails and you're
gonna be using a brush I'm just going to
go in with that it's a synthetic little
Mac - five - brush and we're just going
to take that primer and
I get all over our lids and slightly
above the creased and if you want I like
to take a little bit and just drag it
under the eye as well and get her
prepared now we're going to be dipping
into the beauty killer palette and for
my entire eye area I'm going to use a
shade china white which is a bone matte
shadow and we're just going to take this
color and put it right below the brow
kind of give it a little highlighting
effect I'm also going to take it all the
way down into the lid and we're just
going to connect it now we're going to
use a little detail brush this is the
Mac two to one little eyeshadow
detailing brush and we're gonna carve
out our lid by using shade star power
and I love to coat my entire brush with
this it is very pigmented so BAM hit off
some of that pigment and then we're just
gonna sketch out a little cut crease if
you will type a moment now we're just
gonna drag this color onto the lid just
barely so see on this side how I just
kind of made a little moment we're gonna
just do the same thing with that brush
and as I'm dragging down I'm just gonna
press and Pat down a little bit into the
lash line now what we're gonna be going
in with a little blending brush my
favorite Mac two to four and we're gonna
go in with star power again and now
we're gonna diffuse and soften these
lines by just going over exactly what we
did
but then buffing slightly up so you're
just gonna flick your brush up a little
bit and you're just gonna drag it and
make it look really pretty and
airbrushed now to add a little umph to
the lid we're gonna be going in with a
sugar pill Pro palette this red shade is
one of the best vegan Reds ever invented
I think so we're just going to be going
in with that same little detail brush
now I'm just going to add in some
head right in the crease now hopefully
you guys can see what the hell I'm
seeing because it just gives you that
added little like mmm so we're gonna
take that and just drag it up and then
you want to go in with your blending
brush and go into star power again into
the Beauty color palette and just go
over that pink and red together and let
them have a baby and bam it should look
like this now I left this blank right
here because I'm gonna put in some
orange and then we're gonna add in some
glitter so I'm gonna be going in with
this little Sigma detail brush we're
gonna go in with the sugarpill palette
one more time and hit that orange right
there you see that pigment though and
we're gonna take this and we're just
gonna press it right in the middle of
the lid hi there as you start patting in
that orange color it's gonna blend with
the pink and the red and kind of look
like a sunset we're just gonna bring
that all the way in and let them merge
and notice how I kind of left this blank
right here I love keeping that pink so
it just kind of gives you an extra light
so I love using the two pencil brushes
to do under my eyes this is the Tom Ford
pencil brush and then this is a little
Mac a little more domed and pencil brush
so we're going to be dipping into star
power one more time and we're just going
to connect and buff this under and we're
just going to stop right there now of
course it's looking very neon so now
we're gonna go back in with this guy it
still has a little bit of red in it but
that's okay and we're gonna dip into
star power and then I'm actually gonna
go with this dark purple type of
metallic it's a weird color and we're
just gonna dip into this one it's called
violence and we're just gonna actually
take that and put it over star power and
mix them together and here is where I'm
going to go in one more time with star
power on a separate brush and just kind
of connect those and blend up and out
you want that seamless blend look
alright now we're going to be dipping
into this dark shade called vanity and
we're just going to drag it just really
fine
the lashline and this is just to darken
the endive so it gives it some more
drama you can go back in with that
little detail brush and just go over it
without dipping it into the pan you're
just going to use what's already on the
brush alright now that the eyeshadow is
complete we're gonna go in with the Mac
fascinating white eye pencil we're just
gonna really exaggerate this and make
the eye pop so I'm gonna go in heavy and
this is really gonna transform the eye
woof
look at that white liner I totally just
open up the I made it go now for the
glitter I'm gonna be going in with a
little synthetic brush and we're gonna
be using the lid clearly liquid glitter
base so I am just going to dip the brush
right in don't be afraid people I like
to do one eye at a time just to make
sure I like what I'm doing here so I'm
going to take that glitter base and just
put it right there and then we're
actually gonna take some and put it over
the orange and then of course I put some
underneath the eye so we're just gonna
tuck that in there
and now we're gonna go in with elitism
attics champagne which is one of my
favorite glitter of all time now I love
to just take some of the glitter and
pour it into the cap so I can play
around with it then of course same brush
and let's see what happens
whoa yes now I love this glitter because
it has multi dimensions of color you see
that like kind of mint and that lavender
that like this diamond it just looks so
pretty you guys uh-huh I'm just taking
the bristles on the brush and barely
putting them in flat
and there is our glitter now of course
for mascara I'm gonna be going in with
my benefit a roller lash and we're just
going to coat our lashes from top to
bottom before the falsies of course so
let's get to it
now four lashes I'm gonna be going in
with the new bouncing Serengeti for
these ones though mmm they are glamorous
and they are very full so I'm gonna go
with Poppy's on and I'll be right back
all right lashes are done now all we
need to do to finalize this look is the
lips so I'm gonna be going in with my
velour liquid lipstick in shade doll
parts I know it's been sold out for a
few months finally coming back in
October so praise Jesus so we're just
gonna go in with this and let's get to
work
the lipstick is done now all we need to
do is to grab our favorite all nighter
setting spray from urban decay give it a
little one-two-three shake and let's set
this damn face oh we're doing a magazine
