she created on set I guess question
number one is how are you right I'm good
I'm ready first collected a drone yay
yeah this was like what soon as we did
this list we're like obsessed with it
the way that the teal with the pink and
I suggest the lip it just was so pretty
so I'm really happy and the white
mascara is so fun I really live for it
yeah grant what were you I mean
obviously I know we kind of talked about
kinda like a little mermaid vibe but
yeah what was your inspiration behind
the white mascara and just the whole
like they just something like fresh and
like using a lot of color but again like
a mermaid vibes like aqua kwatak like
aqua tones like that's something that we
really wanted to pull from for one of
the looks but this collection has so
many amazing looks that we did you like
the most content for the day we really
took a there yeah we did this a lot of
varieties yeah this one is so it's a
classic Jeffrey but like with like a
2017 summer twist a little twirl to it
now if you guys have seen other pictures
from the ads let us know if you want us
to create any more I think I really want
you to do like the asymmetrical crazy
like lost shapes with the grunt hair I
love we're gonna throw up some pictures
right now from the campaign so you guys
can browse through them oh my god and
this one with the net over my face I got
I love love I wanted to make that
Network I bought the net and like we're
using that we're using all the way and
I'm glad we did it looks so good
and I think one of my favorites is this
one you guys the group shot of all of us
I think everyone looks so blinding and
hot and stunning you know because
glamour orgy sizing vision is personally
my favorite I don't know what we're
going to call this one you guys already
see the fucking witty title the title
but right at this moment I don't know
it's just like like a summer superhero
uh-huh exactly all right you guys if you
want to see us do this not us if you
want to see Nicole transforming into
this beautiful blue smokey
mermaid goddess client then keep on
watching all right so we're about to get
started and Nicole is going to be doing
brows and my eyes first before
foundation I know that the differ
routine for this channel but I kind of
it for it yeah it's good for seconds
doing a lot of color so is it Falls we
can just wait really all right but oh
wait I know a lot of people do that so
the popular yes bitch is joining the
club I'm going to take this Mac
painterly paint-pot
first a classic classic we love this and
just going to lay this all over both of
you eyelids and your brow bone next
we're going to do brows and obviously
we're going to do a wig and a little bit
but for right now it might look a little
funny because we're going to do a baby
pink eye brow we're going to be using
the NYX vivid bright and pink and drug
wars by jeffree star cosmetics hey we're
going to mix the two and then we'll have
a brow that will stay all day and look
beautiful and I know a lot of you have
been wondering when drug lord will be
back because so many love to mix other
liquid lifts and lighten and change
things this will finally be back I want
to say July and so I will forth announce
it soon but it's coming like the next
month
oh gosh thanks for being patient guys
love series
all right an article is going to use
some of my new NARS soft matte complete
concealer this is the lightest shade and
what is this form that is for cleaning
up your brows we're going to carve out
your brows on the bottom and a little
bit on the top love it
she's averse
ok so now we're going to start on eyes
so for this blue eye we're going to use
a little bit of expensive we're also
going to do a couple other fun parks
that we love but right now I'm going to
set under the brow bone with China white
alright now we're going to go in the
crease with I love the sugar fill Tala
I love these shadows we're going to use
this light teal matte color so that will
be my first building block in the crease
and then we'll get darker and darker
nice going to add a little bit of depth
to the crease using expensive with a
thinner blending brush right here just
for accuracy
ok accuracy
alright next I'm going to take a little
bit of swallow on this little tiny
blending brush and we're going to go
right in the crease on the outer corners
I was taking a makeup wipe I'm just
going to clean up right here a little
bit I want it to kind of look like the
blue is kind of coming out to like a cat
eye point but everything very blended
out I'm going to take a little bit more
as expensive on a flat Packer brush and
I'm going to bring this all the way
underneath the eye along the lower lash
line
so I'm gonna still do some stuff to
Jeffries under eye but before that I
want to finish up all of our face and
everything like that so that I get a
really smooth blend under there so for
now I'm going to use this Inglot pigment
in a few 75455 it is a pure pigment
eyeshadow and it is so stunning you guys
and she use a sunset I was living it
looks kind of weird in the little jar
but it just looks so cool in the eyes
yeah I can't wait and to apply it I'm
going to use six-plus first just to give
it a little stick
so let's pack it on magic oh my god fuck
I can't even do my other good oh girl
that just took it to the next level out
of line the skin we're going to go in
with my one of my favorites this is the
afar Sally unicorn essence the clothes
actually never tried this before I'm
excited the America seemed really cool
okay I love how it feels and look at how
love beautiful glitter
I might go oh yeah yeah alright and now
for foundation we're going to use one of
my favorites Bujji is fuck the luxury
skin and kevvie our foundation does SPF
and it has anti-aging properties in it
it's overall just so glowy and stunning
and then we're also going to add in a
little bit of the cover FX custom
enhancer drops for a little bit of a
mermaid hue mm-hmm and this one is in
shade is Celeste you pick a little one
two three oh maybe four five six seven
eight
alright so next we're going to start
highlighting under Geoffrey's eyes using
a little bit of the same NARS concealer
that we used to carve out eyebrow now
we're going to contour using the benefit
hoola kwikki contour stick which we love
when I take a look this on that duo
fiber brush and just bronze Jeffrey yeah
so now we're getting into setting
powders and first thing we reduce that
Jeffrey's under-eye and any area that
I've done highlight so we're going to
use the dermablend professional which
under resist so no good I did some
people say it might give a little bit
like a flashback sometimes but I do it
and then I put powder on top of it and
it's just so snapped
I'll show you great well let's try with
the Beauty Blender for a second and just
tell me it's not like gently

Lumiere powder it's so good I ready to
start bronzing we're going to use the
benefit cheek great pull palette which I
love everything in here it's so amazing
I'm going to start with the hoola light
and then build the intensity with the
hoola yay alright next ready for blush
we're going to use the beautiful Marc
Jacobs blush called lines in last night
that I've used before here and I'm
obsessed about it so we're going to use
it again because it's very similar to
what we used on the photo shoot which is
like anything kind peachy and apricot
