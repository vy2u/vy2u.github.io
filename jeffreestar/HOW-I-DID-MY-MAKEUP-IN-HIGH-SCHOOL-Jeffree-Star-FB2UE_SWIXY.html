channel now it's been a minute since
I've filmed we just got back from Bora
Bora
I am so sun damage and sunburn I've
mentioned a previous video that I have
like discoloration on my face and
everyone rolled her eyes at me and like
no you don't now that I'm sunburned
which is so scary because I am never in
the Sun but when you're in Bora Bora
listen we swam with stingrays and sharks
we went parasailing so I was really in
the Sun a lot and me Nathan and Manny
um well Nathan doesn't wear makeup I
mean Manny did not get glammed for a
full like week and a half so my skin is
like give me some makeup now now you saw
the tag today I am doing how I did my
makeup in high school now the cool thing
about me is that I've been wearing
makeup since like eighth grade so we can
go back a long way and all laugh
together and I can't wait to make fun of
myself I started wearing makeup in ninth
grade to school kind of barely like a
little dab'll of a eye shadow here I was
really nervous and scared about it I
don't know what gravitated me towards
makeup I just love seeing no magazines
and I love watching my mom in the
morning transform from you know normal
girl to glamazon and my mom had this
huge makeup train in her bathroom just
full of drawers and I just remember um
going in there one day and pulling them
all apart and picking out eyeshadows and
glitters and she have you little
pigments that she had collected from
years and years ago and it was just fun
to create I started putting them on my
eyes with my fingers the first color I
ever wore was like this burgundy rusty
red and I put it all over the lid all
under the I was very heroin chic I guess
and I just loved it and I love the fact
that I could wipe it off and I guess be
somebody else or you know it was like
almost like playing a character back
then I think the craziest moment for me
is when I went full on was in 11th grade
and I remember one day I was looking at
like rock magazines and someone had no
eyebrows and I was like oh my god you
can do so much more with your makeup now
my real eyebrows here was gonna go down
Lane I also found a seventh grade
picture you guys so high there's baby
Jeffery seventh grade look at same
fucking nose girl nothing's changed over
here
so if you--if I scrunch my face like
this see this is where my real brows
were supposed to be girl that's way too
low where the fuck am I gonna put my
eyeshadow so brows were way too low for
me I remember one day I found one of my
grandfather's like mach3 razor blades
and I just went swing Schwing and they
were gone and I was like oh my god I
could have so much more room to play
with now when my grandma saw me she
almost had a stroke right in there and
she was just like horrified like you
look like a damn alien here's where it
gets crazy I had no idea how to draw on
a brow back then I went full on like
divine crazy black eyeliner and then I
would do these really dark smoky eyes
and crazy blush like contouring was not
a thing back then contouring and
highlighting was only for really
corrective makeup now obviously it is
such a huge trend and everyone does it
but ten years ago people were not
highlighting and they were not really
contouring unless you're like an a-list
celebrity or you're going to a red
carpet normal folks we didn't do any of
that so I also am a self-taught makeup
artist so in high school is when I
became to really just become obsessed
with being a makeup artist that was my
goal that's what I wanted to be when I
grow up so I just started practicing a
lot on myself at home and then it
transitioned to doing a lot of girls
makeup for the Proms and the school
dances and that sort of stuff so I just
got to play on everybody
but of course yourself is your best
canvas to play around with so in the
beginning I was very what we call Gothic
back then very dark black lipstick pink
lipstick dark dark eyes crazy brows so I
think this tag is really fun and stuff
they're gonna bring me back now a lot of
the makeup I used back then was from Mac
I was a big Mac user and I remember when
Mac was the hottest brand ever they were
so edgy and ten years ago that was every
so I would convince my grandma to take
me to the MAC store at the mall
shout out to South Coast Plaza Mac if
there's anyone that watches that works
there I used to shop there all the time
and I remember when the old location was
on the other side of the mall and now
things are changing everything's just
growing and shifting but um so I get
asked a lot what the hell did you look
like in high school now if you google
that there are some pictures so I'm
going to show you guys though real
pictures the yearbook picture which I've
seen circulating all over Instagram and
Google someone from my high school
scanned the sin so let's just show the
reality so I went to Pacifica High
School now this is my 12th grade
yearbook dug her out of the archives and
no one entry aliy funny is when I opened
up the pages look at my one of my best
friends in high school with me a crazy
letter girl I've been calling myself
Jeffrey star since 10th grade and I also
got my name legally changed oh I think
like 2007 so I've been Jeffrey star for
a long time okay so you can see this has
seen your favorites and look who won
best hair down here yes me and this girl
Cassie she had like hair down to her
butt so of course they picked the girls
long hair and then my crazy ass I can't
believe everyone actually voted for me
and I won the best hair which was so
funny back then because the things let's
talk about your books is that you shoot
all these in like the beginning of the
year so literally a month after this I
dyed my hair all hot pink cut it off did
a mohawk and the rest is history so in
this yearbook I have like crazy orange
red fans of spikes that had these long
black bangs that I dyed black my real
hair color is like that sandy brown and
it's just crazy it's like this is it
going to memory lane look at that look
at baby Jeffery with those six-inch
Gothic boots long jacket wearing little
nylons and that hair honey oh my
God so I guess today we are going to
just talk about my techniques in high
school what I used and some of the
products I had to go back to Mac today
and buy them because I didn't even have
them anymore um but this is gonna be
funny so if you guys want to see how I
used to do my makeup in high school and
just learn about all this crazy shit and
then keep on watching so there was no
primers in high school that was really
not ever a thing but Mac has a stuff
called strobe cream which I know people
still used to this day which I find
amazing it really does work so I think
that's why now this stuff just has kind
of like a luminous a moment to it we're
gonna squirt some ow oh my god it's
crazy how smell can like take you back
so far kind of has like a pearlescent
feel to it so when you are rubbing it on
your face kind of good like this glow
the glow from within that we're all
craving now and I would just rub this
all over my entire face and neck and
then I would do my face makeup now I'm
gonna say this a lot ten years ago we
didn't have which is gonna happen I
think a lot in this video
so I look back and I wore a mask if you
guys think I wear a lot to make it now
oh my god so Mac has these little pots
called studio finish concealer so to use
his product I would take my Mac Studio
Fix which is a very full coverage and I
would open up the powder and underneath
is a sponge so I would take this sponge
and I would take this concealer and I
would use this as foundation you guys so
my entire face was completely covered in
this concealer scrape a lot of it out
and then I would take the sponge oh my
god you know crazy this fills now and I
would literally coat my entire face that
was that oh my god no primer my pores
are like get the fuck out of here now I
always took concealer and I put them all
over my lids this is kind of like my
primer back then and this is way before
I got laser hair removal
so this full coverage concealer
definitely covered stubble and
Mack has like a bigger version called
just the full-coverage foundation and of
course back then you guys know I still
did my damn Nick I wasn't a trifling hoe
back then and I ain't one now
to set this I did not use any setting
powder
none of that stuff but I did use the Mac
Studio Fix so I would take this kind of
like I do nowadays and I literally would
cover my entire face and neck with this
over the concealer and I mentioned this
brush I think once before but I have an
old brush from Mac that I use in high
school I used to literally use this
exact same one they just continued this
a long time ago look at the brush the
bristles are like falling apart you guys
this is the one h6 Mac brush I think
they might have one of these on eBay and
then I'd take this you guys and I would
brush it right over and I would pack it
and literally this blasted all day that
is all I did for face makeup there was
no setting spray there was no under-eye
highlight that was like a few years
later after I did my face makeup I would
do eyebrows now here's where it gets
scary is I would literally use a Mac
smolder eye pencil which I use this a
lot in previous tutorials for like doing
under eye like smokey and like smudging
out so why did I use this for brows I
have no idea you guys but I'm scared I
mean this whole video is kind of about
you know flashbacks and making fun of
ourselves so let's dive in oh my god
I went high up there girl girl girl all
right let's go for it guys I did them so
thin I could like kill a small village I
would go really far and then I'd kind of
cut it like yes I'm trying to recreate
this picture you guys and this shit is
scary and then I would take it all the
way to the hairline so literally that
was my brow and I thought I was too shit
you guys I thought 12th grade you better
work and just like back then you guys
these were always uneven nowadays they
may look like twins a lot of the time
there's still sisters but back then this
was it you guys fucking little commas
back then
I can't even believe this is real ah
Nastasia please don't kill me
moving on you guys for eyeshadow you
ready for this oh my god I used for
eyeshadows from Mac day and night this
is my thing and I actually rebaudioside
a and I'm like damn ten years later Mac
you still got all the damn colors so I
would take this color vellum all my old
Mac lovers will know that shade they
don't make it anymore sadly really
pretty but I'm one that is very similar
is called gesso it's like a matte white
shade now I would put this from brow to
lid there was no primers back then there
was none of that shit so I use my little
Mac - five - which I still use to this
day and uh that's it I would take this
and go from lid to brow everyone
watching I'm scared also not to be a
shady hoe
but these as pigmented as they used to
be because this don't look as wide as I
remember now obviously ten years ago
there could have been different
ingredients I don't know what the hell
but this eyeshadow does not seem as
pigmented as it used to being all right
guys I am blending to fill look at that
yes yes Bruce all right that base color
is down I'm slaying everybody hmm
kidding okay now let's move on now
another Mac eye shadow this was called
pink freeze I would take this and before
I even knew that highlighting was going
to become a worldwide phenomenon I was
highlighting you guys all the way back
then and I would use my Mac one six
eight brush and I would literally just
take it and if you look back at all my
old pictures I always had this crazy
shine here and people are all would be
like you look really plastic and it was
this guy and I would take this and I
would go all the way up to my brow
literally and I'd come down and
contouring was not a thing which no one
in high school contoured now infants are
contouring and it's scary there was no
YouTube back then there was no tutorials
there was nothing but a few Kevin Taquan
books and a dream honey oh my god it's
like a flashback memory lane I would
take this all the way to where my eye
and I take it all the way down like
I went crazy it's so funny compared to
today's highlighting powders and
highlighters this does not look as
blinding as it used to all right so that
was how I used this shadow it was kind
of like this huge highlight and then
even before I did eyes you guys want to
really know what I did oh my god
kill me now I used a little Mac 129 yes
okay 129 I would use this blush and you
know remember contouring there was no
contour I would take this Mac dolly mix
blush and I would take it and I would
take it and take it and take it and then
this is what I did ready this blush was
my contour you guys like I would take
the blush from the apples of my cheeks
all the way back like what's up Stephen
King's it what the fuck co tea girl I
would take it and I would bring it all
the way up girl mm-hmm and I would
really go in like we used to do things
really heavy in Orange County that's how
I did it so that blush kind of merged in
with my highlight if you will and that's
what we did all right blush is complete
um cheeks are done now listen the eyes
here's where I guess crazy you guys
let's dive into the eyes I would use two
shades only very gothic very smoky and
it is the MAC Cosmetics print eyeshadow
this is like a matte gray and then the
famous carbon black eyeshadow from Mac
this used to be the blackest eyeshadow
on the market these two were like oh I
would hit pan every hour so what would I
do same pencil that I used for my brows
my god Chemical admitting this I would
take it and I would like put it on my
entire lid so it was almost like my base
and I would take it and just drag it
across my lash line and I would create
like a
go so just do like a that type of moment
and then I would start to drag it up and
if it didn't show up how I wanted to I'd
take a lighter to it or I would just
smear the black all over no obviously
this is gonna look really ugly before it
starts to look kind of cute which this
whole looks not kind of cute but you
guys get it and that was it and then I
would go over this liner and start to
blend up and then I would take a little
blending brush and I would dip it into
the actual black shadow it's gonna hold
up these two right here real quick like
barely there and then I would dip it to
print this matte gray and this would be
my best friend for just creating that
little gradient so I would go in with a
brush and I would just start to buffer
up and I would do it really dramatic
looking back I definitely went ham and
that's how I blended and uh no I
definitely would smoke out oh well you
know my version of smoked out back then
if the under I was a very very racoon
back then so I would take the same
smolder eye pencil
BAM and I would just drag it all the way
down my waterline which is actually what
I still do to this day and then I just
smudge it out which this liner is
perfect for that definitely not good for
brows but hey back then you did what you
could and then I would dip into the same
grain black come on carbon and I didn't
think I did the grave much back then but
I definitely dip into the black and I
went in and just smear to the bottom
across until I look like a raccoon
alright we are smoked out last but not
least I would go back in with a little
Packer brush dip into that grey and then
I would run it along the edges because I
felt like it really made it airbrushed
and seamless back then
alright now for mascara I don't even
remember what sort of mascara I used
back then I sat there and I'm like
grasping in my memory and I really
remember so I think for mascara I
definitely used some sort of drugstore
one because I was definitely a stealing
makeup from rite-aid way back then when
I had no money I would just steal
foundation of mascara and eye pencils
all the time which I do not recommend
doing anymore
and stealing is horrible but hey when we
were broke bitch that wants to look good
I did what I had to do so I'm just gonna
apply some black mascara to these lashes
now the horrible thing about high school
is I never wore falsies which when you
look back it makes the makeup look even
crazier and the cool thing about this
look is that when you were doing a
mascara and if you bump the wand
anywhere and don't matter cuz your eyes
are fucking black so BAM and same for
under we're almost done with this look
shockingly enough how much to twirl was
this easy
alright so to finalize this look there
was no lashes there was no extra
highlight there was no contour there was
not even a finishing spray which is
fucking horrible so all of there was to
do was to put on lipstick now I love
black lipstick red or pink that was all
now when I first started 12th grade I
was a little hesitant to wear full
full-on makeup so I would do like a
gloss then a few months later I got over
it and I discovered a pink niveau
lipstick from Mac my god I must have
went through like 20 tubes of this I
wore it morning a lunch and dinner and
uh let's put it on mm-hmm
there's that Jeffery classic pink oh my
god you better work overdraw alright you
guys so after I would do my lipstick I
was pretty much done now of course the
high school football team from my 12th
grade year could not be here to finalize
the you know setting spray with their
come but you know we just got to do what
we got to do so besides that this look
is completely done I'm ready to slay the
volleyball court all right guys this is
the final look of how I used to do my
makeup in high school I'm looking in the
mirror like you know what bitch it ain't
that bad now the brows
really extreme prying of course
throughout the years I have changed them
from pink to purple to green to taupe
and I've definitely lowered them thicken
them up done better arches but hey we
all got to start from somewhere so if
you were someone in high school that
looked crazy or someone that never wore
makeup and now you love it I think
that's awesome I think change is of
course very necessary we are all
evolving as makeup artists and as people
so I mean this is like a trip down
memory lane I'm looking in the
viewfinder like hmm
okay girl I might have to revisit this
just blush and no contour look I mean it
is a it is really severe but hey that's
how I wore it but um I hope you guys had
a lot of fun watching this I had such a
good time doing this definitely fun to
look through all these old pictures and
have a laugh and just appreciate where
