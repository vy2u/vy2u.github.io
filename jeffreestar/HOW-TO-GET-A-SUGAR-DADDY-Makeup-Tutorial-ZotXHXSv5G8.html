up in the air though they don't care so
they made an amazing it man I'm gonna up
in the air I want you trying to get
stuck in it what's up everybody welcome
back to my channel today we are diving
into this glamorous glowy peachy smokey
eye look I'm feeling the high-fashion
fantasy and yes I might have sex after I
finish this video but today we are going
to recreate this look now I got so many
requests from about a week or two ago
when me and Manny did our reading mean
hate comments video you guys are all
like what the hell is on your eyes so
today we're going to recreate that and
can we just talk about the glow for a
second like oh it's like burning my
cheeks my retinas are on fire we are
using two highlighters today for the
glow we're also going to be testing out
some new Marc Jacobs beauty products
that have real coconut infused in the
makeup do they work on do they not that
is the question but besides that you
guys if you want to see how I created
this fantasy then keep on watching
alright let's dive into this to look so
today as you can tell I have no contacts
in these are my real brown hazel eyes
now for primer today we are going to be
going into one of my all-time favorites
the sicily double ten CR primer this one
is everything so I'm going to of course
coat my fingers and rub this all over of
my face
for foundation today I'm going to be
going in with something I haven't really
used on camera before it is from the
bread
and this is the lingerie foundation now
this one is supposed to be a skin fusion
like texture where you just look amazing
and flawless now let's get a little damp
Beauty Blender and get to work all right
now for concealer today I'm going to be
going in with the new NARS a soft matte
complete concealer I use this the other
day in a full face first impressions and
I was shocked at how like smooth it went
on my skin I was like oh okay honey so
we're going to be dipping it again I'm
just going to go in because this is mine
of course I'm just going to go in with
the Beauty Blender and get some on the
tip come on tip and I'm just going to
take this and put it right under my eye
oh my god you guys this concealer like
melts into your skin maybe because the
Beauty Blender is damp and it really
works well with it but mmm only thing I
wish is a shade was a little lighter
this is their lightest shade this is
number one I just wish there is a little
bit more but I'm going to add some
powder in a second and brighten it and
set this face now I'm going to take my
Mac Studio Fix and shade Shivering white
choice is the damp Beauty Blender I've
been doing this for years and lately I
have kind of been you know I've been
trying so many new products I've been
steering away from this but I'm going
back to my favorite trick of really like
lightening Mandor eyes and looking
lifted so we're going to take that on
the damp Beauty Blender and what I do is
I'll just take it right under the eyes
and I will press it and almost like an
upside down triangle type of motion and
it just gives you in a look of like Oh
our skin is that all right now we're
going to really set the under eyes in
anywhere where if I concealer like the
chin the bridge of my nose and of course
the forehead and I'm going to go in with
my favorite setting powder of all time
lemare the powder and you guys know I
had been using GIMP Beauty blenders
forever to dip into the powder it melt
right into your skin and it is a nice
little beauty hack and we're going to
buff that into the skin and you can
leave it and just have it sit there for
a minute walk soaks in and you can brush
it away in a second now I'm just going
to take a little synthetic brush and
brush off all of the loose powder and
now it's time to do a little bit of
contour if you will so today I'm going
to be going in with a brand new bronzer
that I just discovered at Sephora and it
is from the brand Marc Jacobs of course
Marc Jacobs beauty is exclusively in
Sephora now this is the new coconut
bronzer look how big the packaging is
honey yes you know I'm a size Queen my
god it smells so good it's like pure
coconut in your nose and this shade is
called tantastic it is the mega bronzer
and this is of course limited edition in
the beautiful stunning white packaging
so now it also has a brush you can buy
with it which looks something like this
look how big that brush is though look
at that now I think you're supposed to
you know use the brush with this and go
in I'm not sure oh wow that's like a lot
of product so I might go in a little bit
just to see what it looks like I'm
scared it's going to be really pigmented
I guess there's only one way to find out
all right I just bronze up my entire
face we hit the cheeks forehead jawline
and nose oh my brush smells like coconut
I'm like I'm hungry now girls haha now
we are going to do some highlight right
now my new favorite combination is peach
goddess with Eclipse skin cross mixing
these together oh my lord so I am going
to take this on a soft day a 23 brush
and we are going to go into peach
goddess
the man pumping it ham all right peach
garden is laid down and now I'm going to
take out your clip and use eight more
feet five ten brush and we're just going
to gently caress the moon and put that
right over woo low and help me now
plenty all right now you guys just see
me do my brows a million times I'm going
to quickly do them off the camera with a
little bit of benefit precisely my brow
and Beyond associate dip brow and I'll
be right back alright now let's get
these eyes started today we're going to
be using the YSL Couture eye primer so
remember to always of course use a
synthetic makeup brush when applying any
primer alright now that the primer is
down I'm going to take a ivory shade and
put it all over my lid up to the brow
bone and I'm going to be really shady
because it is a shadow that I am working
on for the fall and it's not final so no
one go crazy and post about it or you
can't boast about it because I love when
you do it but it's just a shadow that
I'm working on that I'm not going to
show on camera yet because I don't know
if I'm going to change it or alter it
but the fun thing about lab samples is
that you can play around with it for a
while and tweak it any which way you
want so it's so it's kind of similar to
my shade China white in the beauty color
palette but it's a little more huh
a little more intense now this eye look
is really simple it looks a little smoky
and dramatic but I really only used like
two brushes and literally two eyeshadows
so we're going to pull out my androgyny
eyeshadow palette and today we're going
to I'm feeling like Vanna White but uh
today we're going to be dipping into
only a few shades and one of them which
is the main star the look is of course
charm my favorite transition color for
really any look and we're literally just
going to start patting this on our eye
so you're going to take the brush and
you're just going to start in the inner
core
and I'm going to go like this and that
is like a little placeholder for where I
am going to stop so we're going to start
there and now we're going to take this
brush with the same of course shadow and
we're going to go all the way over and
then you're going to take it and I'm
going to start going into my crease and
we're going to go all the way in like
this
and you're going to stop it right
outside of the eye and now you're going
to fill it in and do the same on the
other side okay
so I am just packing on charm all over
the lid and what I started off camera is
I took a blending brush and I just kind
of feathered it out fairly with any
product on the end you're just going to
go and basically in little motions like
this you're just going to blend up and
outward and now we're going to take a
tiny little Mac detailer brush this is
the two-two-one and we're going to dip
into shade dominatrix this beautiful
dark chocolate shade right here a little
goes a long way with this one so I like
to coat the bristles completely knock it
off a little bit and then this is really
easy I'm going to put this right in my
crease so I'm going to tilt my head up a
little bit so we're just going to
massage this into the crease and give us
that really dramatic look
all right now this I look is almost done
we just got to smoke out the under but
before I do that I'm just going to go
back in to eclipse really quickly with
the brush we put on the primer and we're
just going to go right below the brow
bone and we're just going to pack on
some Eclipse right in the arch of my
brow just so it gives it a more uplifted
look alright now we're going to go in
with one of my all-time favorite black
eyeliner this is smolder from Mac and I
am just going to put this in my
waterline quickly and then get to smoke
in
alright now I'm going to go back in with
charm we're just going to place this
right below the waterline and just drag
it out and sometimes like to chop my
head so there's no fallout alright now
I'm going to take another tiny little
brush this is the morphe 5:07 and i'm
going to go back into dominatrix for one
split second and I'm literally just
going to brush right below where I put
smolder only like barely so it's only
going to give you a little bit of a
liner effect but like barely it's like
just a little detail I want to add oh hi
there now it is time support mascara
so of course you all know about to go in
with my benefit roller lash mascara and
then we're going to put on some falsies
so let's get to it I'm gonna dam alright
now I'm going to quickly pop on some
lashes and today I'm gonna go in with
the Lily lashes in style Miami these are
really gorgeous but not too dramatic I
want the eyes to really have a moment of
like hi and peachy and I'm here bitch so
I'll be right back alright
lashes are on now it's time for the lips
today I'm going to be going in with the
Marc Jacobs liquid lip cream in shaded
what it'll hold again yours
to try this is a beautiful warm toned
nude color I think it's going to go
perfect with this eye look
all right lips are on I love combo right
now all right I think the only thing
left to do is set the face and not to
sound like this is a coconut Marc Jacobs
whore ad but they also came out with a
brand new is setting spray and I just
got all the stuff in the mail right
before filmless so I thought you know
what let's give us the world now you
will see some missing because I was
trying out the pump I heard so many
mixed reviews online and I saw my girl
Jacqueline Hill on snapchat a few weeks
ago using this and a lot of people were
saying that the spray came out like
really like I guess intense I noticed
that if you don't press down all the way
it does kind of shoot out so quick
advice for anyone that has this or is
about to try it you have to go all the
way down and then it creates a beautiful
fine mist so I saw a lot of people just
kind of like venting or asking me have I
tried this yet so I haven't tried it on
my face I just sprayed it a million
times so let's see what happens oh oh it
smells so good I should knock you to do
it this is called you guys sorry this is
the perfecting coconut setting mist
recover it says on the bottom now I am
noticing that it didn't completely like
dry down on my forehead area but the
rest of my things it did someone's going
to take this Beauty Blender and just
kind of buff out those little like looks
almost like droplets on my forehead and
there we go and is blended pretty
blended now the settings we also said
that it's supposed to lock in your
makeup for like 24 hours I'm like girl
I'm wearing makeup for more than six
hours but I will let you guys know in
the description box if this worked for
me or not look so far it smells amazing
I mean all the coconut stuff is just
like I'm like hungry right now craving a
chocolate bar with some coconut shavings
on it but I'm alright you guys I think
that this look is almost complete I want
to change my hair and do something a
little different
because so many of you are like girl
we're just slate intro shots where's the
 wigs
we'll be right back then and this is the
final look I am feeling this high
glamour moment look at this hair beige
so laid by David Scissorhands don't
 play me baby I love this look I
feel like I could wear this anywhere to
Walmart to the grocery store to a
fashion show New York on the runway of
Paris I'm just feeling myself right now
but I hope you guys love the final look
I had so much fun filming it I would
love it if you guys recreated this look
if you have the androgyny palette dip
into charm honey and create some magic
thank you guys so much for watching this
video as always you guys are the best I
will see you on the next video
