channel now today I know you're like
whoa bitch word your hair go we are just
doing a skin video this is kind of like
a part one to a look I'm going to be
posting in two more days so if you watch
this one the full transformation will be
up like a day or two later so this is
just focusing on skin today so when I
did my what's in my bag video a lot of
you were like hmmm what let's do fro did
you get a surgery view the darker well
let me explain it thank God for makeup
because the trickery wiped off later
that night so what did i do differently
in that video besides doing that long
peachy coral amazing wig I also used a
lot of bronzer we're talking a lot of
bronzer I definitely use something
darker and I also mixed foundations that
darken my overall complexion so what did
I do different
I brought the highlight to an all-time
crazy 10 so usually a maybe out of 9 and
a half today we're out of 20 so if you
want to see how to get this crazy barbie
skin then keep on watching to get
started you really want to have
moisturized skin so whatever is super
moisturizing for you guys you stop
before you start I'm gonna be using a
new product from the mayor this is
called that perfecting treatment and
it's basically their new primer it's
supposed to be really hydrating and give
you a really nice finish so let's get
started so I'm just going to take a
little bit rub it in my hands and let's
rub it all in our skin ah smells so
refreshing I'm like mmm come through
moisture I'm gonna let that soak in for
a second all right now for foundation
I'm actually gonna do a little shade a
little darker than what I know I might
do so if you watch the what's in my bag
video you were probably like oh she's a
little more tan um yes I used a little
darker foundation so today I'm going to
be using my georgia or money luminous
silk foundation I'm going to be using
this today and I'm also going to be
mixing with this Laura Mercier silk
cream oil-free photo edition Foundation
Jesus age so I bought a shade darker
than my usual skin tone and I'm going to
be mixing this today now both of them
say shake well
before use well then let's get to
shaking okay that should be good
so I usually excuse the back of my hand
we're just gonna do a few pumps 1 2 mm
to an ad and then this one I do a little
less because it is darker and we'll see
let's look a little BAM that should be
good enough and always put the caps back
on your stuff right away no one wants
your foundation to dry out okay so I'm
gonna be using a damp Beauty Blender now
this is more damp than usual this is
like really nice and wet so I'm just
going to take this foundation and move
it around and mix it on my hand now I'm
gonna take it right and I'm just gonna
start dotting and around my face so
obviously we're not blending it we're
just we're dabbing we're not dabbing
with marijuana
we aren't dabbing with foundation I like
to really get everything covered and we
are gonna bring some down the neck later
because my neck is like Casper the ghost
and this foundation is a little more
bronzy now it's time to blend I'm just
gonna use the back of my beauty blender
and I'm just going to blend this out now
this damp Beauty Blender is really gonna
help just really get that skin nice and
glistening so we are just going to blend
this out now notice how I had a little
yellow bruising still from my hairline
surgery we're just gonna go right over
that and cover it up and continue to
blend and buff and the ears are
important for this one so they match
your skin tone and then we're gonna
bring it all the way down the neck and
then we're gonna just take it down now
I'm going to take it under my eyes one
more time and just really buff it into
my skin so that primer moisturizer is
working it looks amazing and I'm
starting to become Malibu Barbie right
before your eyes
after this foundation is drying and
settling in it just have a little
luminosity to it which I love so if you
see when I turn my cheek you see a
little highlight right there that is no
makeup except the foundation which was
really cool it gives you kind of that
glow so if I coated my entire face with
powder like normal I would lose all of
that and I would turn into a matte
mannequin doll head kind of like this
guy now we don't want to look like her
today we want to look like a dewy bronzy
Barbie doll so sorry Jeffry jr. you need
to go away today
right so I'm going to be doing some
highlight and contour and then extreme
shine which is how you get that effect
in all my pictures so before we do that
I'm going to be taking this touch a
luminous dewy skin mist and we're just
going to shake this up lightly now
usually I've seen people use as a primer
I know nikkietutorials has raved about
this so girl this sure better be good
and I'm actually I'm gonna use it after
my foundation almost kind of like a
doobie setting spray I did this the
other day for that look I love it is
that enough it's never enough okay now
we are going to do some light
highlighting and contouring and then
we're going to get into that Barbie
Sparkle so I'm gonna be going in with my
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer this is
in shade fair and I love this because
it's really creamy it just blends
amazing and I'm gonna take this and
we're gonna do a lot today because we
want that extreme highlight like hi we
need Ken to want to us again so we
need to really feel highlighted okay now
what else do we want to highlight maybe
the little you know smile lines that I
hope and pray I never have and then well
just course we got to do our forehead
and then high just a little bit down the
nose give our chin a little moment and
that should be good for me now of course
with our damp Beauty Blender we start to
blend now I'm taking this highlight all
the way back to my hairline and I'm
gonna take it up a little bit you want
an appearance of like oh good morning
all right now we're going to take this
lower merci a cream contour book if
you've never tried this oh I know I'm
not a huge fan of cream contours but
this one you guys I used the medium
three it's the darkest shade in the
palette and I am such a fan of this I'm
going to be taking a Smith cosmetics
to-20 brush now I don't know this is
really specifically for contouring I use
because I just love the way the brushes
so I'm just gonna dip in there and I'm
gonna do my cheekbones a little higher
than you guys normally see and guess
what I'm gonna stop right there
so a lot of people were like you look
really different in that bag video I did
my contour way different than how I
normally do it and I didn't do it as low
so we're gonna take this and we're just
gonna paint on obviously we're gonna
blend that out just kidding we're done
we're gonna really define that jawline
and I'm gonna take it and go all the way
of course when this is blended out this
will look a lot more subtle but I use
the darkest shade because it just blends
nicely and actually shows up sometimes
if you use a shade that's too light it
just blends into your skin and you're
like oh I didn't do anything and then
for the forehead actually just take it
and go like this a little bit so
there'll be a little product on the
Beauty Blender now and of course since I
have a wig cap on I can blend over that
cap and I just go in like that and buff
the product directly on the forehead now
of course before the surgery I needed
about 20 more minutes now that my
hairline is a little lower it is a lot
easier to get ready now this may look a
little more severe than normal that's
what I'm going for
now we're gonna buff out those cheeks
now when I do that I'm going to take the
Beauty Blender I'm going to kind of
squeeze it a little like this and then
I'm gonna manipulate the product of
where I want it to go so if you want to
stay there not bleed down you just press
and go up alright the contour is buffed
in I am loving how this is looking
come on bronze and then I'm actually
gonna shock you guys and go back in with
that to catch a spraying wait touch-a
touch-a say that correctly I'm sorry if
my California accent it up we're
just gonna go over that contour and the
whole face with this again now this says
it's a dewy skin mist it really works
it's a nice little refresher now I'm so
used to being matte this is kind of hard
for me to handle on one but I love it my
skin it was really nice so the contour
is bucked and
I am loving it now the only powder I'm
going to use today before I do a cream
and then powder highlight yes that's how
I did that trick I am going to set my
under eye so let's plot our Laura
Mercier translucent powder and I'm going
to be really light with this today and
I'm just gonna dab in the Beauty Blender
like so BAM that's it you want to stay
really hydrated and a lot of times I see
people putting on so much powder under
their eyes I just kind of like takes
away all that moisture so if you have
dry skin I really wouldn't do baking or
anything like that
because you're just gonna look way more
dry than you need to so I am just
pressing this powder under my eyes
really minimal that will get rid of any
fine lines that we're starting to show
no matter how youthful we can look under
the eyes we can all get creasing which
is so all right now before we highlight
we're gonna go in with a little bit more
bronzer now this Chanel one if you guys
have not tried this this is called the
sole a tenday Chanel it's amazing when I
find someone actually works
I like stick with it and this is really
cool it comes in a jar like this kind of
Finn and you take off the little plastic
guy and it's there now it has like a
most like texture so I take the brush
that Chanelle recommended of course it's
one of theirs this is the foundation
brush number seven and as always
everything I use today will be listed in
the description box below so we're just
gonna take this and I'm just gonna
Swisher it around and I like this cuz
it's really light even though it looks
to be heavy in here it's really nice so
I'm just going to kind of go over where
that contour was and just kind of blend
up so this is where I'm just going to
kind of go in and define that cream
contour and just kind of go a little bit
more ham than normal
we're going for that America's Next Top
 like beautiful flawless finish
come through Tyra now I'm gonna take a
little bit of this and drag it under my
chin
alright bronzing is complete now brings
me to my favorite item of last year this
is the natasha de Nonna face glow like
shimmer cream yes this is a cream now I
wore this a few times last year in the
summer and my cheeks were like
radioactive when people walked by me
there their eyes
so I'm gonna be using this today and she
also has a setting powder for the cream
which i think is genius now if you've
never heard of Natasha her makeup line
is based out of Israel where she's from
and she has really dope YouTube videos
as well and I love her techniques and
her products are just I know I sound
like QVC but I'm actually obsessed with
her and of course she has her own brush
which I've never really seen a brush
like this it's like tapered so cool
where the hairs are like dense in there
then it has a little sparse ones so
Natasha's trick that shows talks about
is that she uses the cream and she used
a Beauty Blender so this is high shine
like extreme pigment so last time I used
it on my actual face and it was like oh
my god intense so I'm just gonna use it
with the Beauty Blender today and if
it's not blinged enough we'll just add
more a trick that I did in my what's in
my bag video is I took my highlight and
I didn't bring it all the way down like
I usually do I kept it more on the high
plans of my cheeks which will give it a
more elevated look so I'm going to
squeeze my Beauty Blender
where that product was and I'm just
gonna lightly start dabbing it on now
obviously already you're like whoa so
this is me really sharing it down now
you can build it up and go crazy in a
second which is exactly what I did so
notice how I'm not taking my highlight
all the way down we're keeping it a
little more here and that is the trick
for this look now I'm just taking it and
I'm layering a little more on there and
you want to put this right above your
contour and put it on the high plains of
your face alright now I love to take it
and kind of go around where I draw my
brows then and just kind of give it that
really intense sheen as a product gets a
little bit more less on the Beauty
Blender I like to go around the brows
and then notice how I did not contour
the nose earlier Barbie don't got no
contour nose but we are going to do some
extreme shine and leave the nose looking
like a beak
of hope since this is a cream we are
going to set it with the glow powder
this is shade number one called light
and I'm just going to take this brush
that was designed for this and we're
just gonna dip it in here now this is
supposed to be a setting glow powder for
the cheeks so I'm just going to put this
right on top oh yes
lips it's like metal drenched now
normally I stay away from my chin I'm
gonna put a little bit underneath my
mouth this is extreme glow today and
then we're just gonna take some of that
powder and put it above our brows and
then the tip of your nose you can do as
much as you want this is an extreme
luminosity type of look so take it on
alright now to finish off this look
we're gonna be using that Burberry nude
glow highlighter mmm you guys know this
is my favorite so we're gonna be using a
more feet 5/10 as always and we're just
gonna barely dip in there because
this is pigmented and I'm gonna take it
right here so just on the really high
planes in my cheeks we're gonna add even
more this highlighter sticks to that
cream and it just makes it in sane look
at that oh and again just right here if
you want your face to look like you just
took a bath in metal this is it I'm
gonna be doing a little mist and fix for
makeup forever this is a good setting
spray when you want to keep all that
velocity-- amazingness alright so after
you have taken a shower in your makeup
setting spray I mean of course you want
to finish off this look with full crazy
eyes eyebrows maybe a little blush you
don't need the blush lips full hair and
whatever outfit you wanted the choice
but for now this is just a skin tutorial
so we are done you guys I think maybe
just to finish off so I don't look like
an alien head I'm just going to throw on
some lip gloss hi sugar and this look is
complete alright guys so this is the
final complete look now why do I call it
Barbie skin because I get asked all the
time how do I get that type of effect on
my pictures I know a lot of you think it
is phase two nor camera plus or an app
it's honestly all good lighting and
a cup now what do I normally do after
this sort of look is done I go outside
and I go in the shade not the direct Sun
but if you find some shade where the Sun
is glowing around you get that camera
out click click and your cheeks are
going to look exactly like mine do so I
hope you guys learn some new tricks and
tips for this look and as always
subscribe to my channel and give me a
thumbs up down below and if you want to
see part two of this video if you want
to see part two of this video it will be

transformation alright guys thank you so
