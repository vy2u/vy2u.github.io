channel good morning today we are gonna
get full motherfucking coverage with a
new foundation that just hit the market
and girl when I tell you that my twitter
feed has been going off the hook to
review this I'm like okay girl we are
here we're gonna sit down and I've been
traveling a lot I'm sure if you follow
me on snapchat which if you don't
awkward but if you do you know that I
was just in Helsinki Finland and I was
expanding jeffree star cosmetics into
crazy parts of Europe that I've never
been to before and it was in saying of
course we filmed some footage so we'll
be doing a vlog later but I'm back and
girl at the jet lag is hitting me it's
ten hours ahead in Europe's on my brain
it's just like I don't know what's
happening but now that I'm home it's
time to get back to filming I know it's
been about a week and everyone is like
so hi alright so today we're gonna jump
right into it we are going to talk about
the new Hoodie Beauty faux filter
foundation now this has been all over my
feet to review and I've seen all over
Instagram I've seen a lot of people say
it is like very airbrush quality which
you all know I want to look like a
fucking plastic doll at all times so
hopefully this gives us the coverage
that we need so in this video today we
are going to test it out I'm gonna do of
course a full wear test with this we are
going to do one side of the face with a
brush which will be this arty sky right
here and then the other side of my face
will be with a Beauty Blender this brand
has also put out a brush that goes at
the foundation and a primer and there
are so many reviews on the all three
already so I'm like you know a girl if I
were to buy a new foundation anyway I
wouldn't buy the primer that it comes
with necessarily or the brush because we
all have our own tools at home
and we all have our own way of getting
ready so I feel like girl if you're
gonna spend money on a foundation you
don't need the brush and you shouldn't
need the primer and I see a lot of
people get discouraged because they see
and I'm not talking about this brand I
just mean overall they see people come
out with all these different products
and they combine them together and
they're like but the primer didn't
really work well with the foundation
well it depends on your skin type of
course so today
I'm gonna be using my own primer that I
have been using a lot and these brushes
instead of the hood of beauty ones today
we are just going to be testing out the
foundation so if you want to see what
the hell happens then keep on watching
so this foundation retails for $40 and
when you open it up inside you get this
gorgeous little bottle I love the ombre
on the bottle with the black I love the
square component it kind of reminds me
of a Tom Ford Foundation I have but even
more cute now of course this is plastic
it is not glass which is pretty good for
travel I know a lot of people don't like
traveling with glass bottles because
they can break and who wants a broken
foundation bottle in their makeup kit
Lord been there done that hated it when
you open it up of course it has a pump
so it is all sealed in there and is
really not gonna spill which I really
love
now the shade range is really cool
because there is over 30 shades for this
brand but Rihanna's been tied at 40 I
know and she's fucking everything for
doing that I know that creating a
foundation which I know a lot of you're
gonna be like where is the Geoffrey
Foundation it's coming I promise when
you hop on Sephora calm it says that
this is of course in a Sephora exclusive
besides the crazy shade range this is
going to give you a full or a medium
coverage look so if you like sheer
foundation I don't even know why the
hell you're watching this girl this is
for normal dry combination oily so
they're basically saying it's for
everyone now what else do we need to
know about this foundation I mean girl
its foundation right so a lot of your
like let's go let's go it says use a
dime size amount or less that's gonna
cover my whole face oh my god
apply to skin using circular or dabbing
motions okay it says although it dries
to a radiant powder finish if you have
oily skin setting it with a thin layer
of translucent powder gives you a more
incredible flawless all-day matte look
alright alright so we're just gonna
apply this you guys like let's keep it
real like we're gonna yeah that's mean
that's it I'm looking at the
instructions its foundation y'all we
know how to put the damn foundation on
all right deep breath engines are ready
to roll
umm I have so many primers I know I've
been using this one all year the Sisley
one is bomb oh I keep I also keep you
using that far Sally
unicorn essence this one is really good
very good like sticky like the
foundation sticks on so let's just go on
with this one
like I said there was 30 shades released
so I bought a few online you know how it
is how do you shave match yourself
Sephora will suggest things but you
never know I got three shades here I got
custard vanilla and angel food so all
the names are listed of course or right
at the top now I did swatch them already
just on the side of my face
so I didn't have to do that on camera
and have to wipe it off and redo the
primer the whole thing so last night I
just want like that I didn't blend it
out or try it yet because I hate trying
things unless it's on camera and now I'm
gonna do custard and mix in a drop of
vanilla so of course this says use like
one pump and it's supposed to cover
everything I don't know about all that
so let's try the artiste brush first
this will be on this side of the face
BAM my right and this will be on my left
let's see what this looks like BAM yes
allegedly that's supposed to be a lot to
me I need like three more pumps but I
think maybe cuz I'm gonna do two sides
of the face I should do more pumps now
let me do a tiny drop of this just to
get a little bit in there BAM you guys
see that literally a drop of vanilla in
there and then we're gonna take the end
of a brush we're just gonna mix it right
there and put that right on there like
you know every foundation kinda has a
fragrance or like a scent this one is
like really strong it reminds me of like
old like old lady perfume or like oh my
god like you know any smell of perfume
and you know okay whatever we got to get
to blending is there on how fast this
dries but anyway I'm gonna take a drop
of that right you see right there and
we're just going to blend and let's see
what happens
and we will do of course half of the
neck and a little bit on the chest area
all right guys let's see it before and
after now obviously it is a little
darker than my normal skin tone which is
what I wanted I do like a little bit of
tan to my foundation now of course this
was applied what the artiste brush so as
you can see we're just gonna do a little
split here is my normal skin and then
here is the flow filter foundation on it
okay so so far I really love the
coverage obviously you know I'm a full
coverage bitch love how it's looking
first impressions it looks nice
it's not looking cakey only thing is
like even though this is like it's I
guess dry now I still smell a foundation
it's like it's lingering which not the
end of the world I don't really mind
smells all the time but it's a little
strong now I heard a lot of people say
you don't have to like set the
foundation with powder which girl if
you're gonna do a full mask anyway
you're gonna set your foundation with
powder so a lot of people are like hey
test it when it's dry and feel it and
yes it does feel a little tacky and
sticky which I don't know if that's a
bad thing because other brands I have
had that happen before and I'm about to
put powder on anyway so let's do another
pump on my hand and let's try the Beauty
Blender it's crazy because when I first
read like one pump I was like come on
girl but one pump you guys this is fit
one more time hmm
come on discoloration work all right so
now we're gonna take the Beauty Blender
which has no product on it yet we're
about to hit it right there and I like
to dot of course all over the skin and
let's blend and see what happens
all right this site is blended to
perfection and let's zoom in and see
which side we like more we have the
beauty blender on this side and then of
course the artiste brush on this side
looking at the skin usually see like a
difference but they kind of applied the
same which is not a bad thing I'm like
looking at the monitor any difference in
like huh not really the beauty blender
made it apply I think yeah I was like
about to say something but I'm like not
really any different now went on really
nice with the beauty blender so whether
you have a dense brush or this sponge I
think it looks very pretty it is
definitely a full coverage foundation
which I love and yeah one pump really
covered well I didn't cover the entire
face remember because I did use two
tools but it definitely would have if I
didn't wipe it off and do another one
which is crazy so you are definitely
getting a lot of product for forty
dollars we're gonna do a wear test so
we're gonna see how this looks
throughout the rest of my day and I am
going to get ready I'm gonna do my
normal concealer routine powder contour
everything and let's see how the
foundation holds but with the Beauty
Blender is it tacky yes it is a little
bit I was like it's almost less over
here but no not really it's the same
okay you guys so overall I like it so
far
the smell is the only thing that's kind
of bothering me it's not the end of the
world I would love it if it went away so
we will see of course it's only been
five minutes so let me do some more
steps so you guys can see let's just go
in with some concealer and let's see
what happens of course we're gonna go in
with our shape tape concealer and let's
see how this formula holds now sometimes
I know a lot of people think that if a
new foundation doesn't go with your
favorite concealer that's a bad thing
sometimes ingredients don't match they
don't mix well together and they just
are not gonna be friends so you do have
to try different primers and concealers
with your new foundation to see what's
really gonna work with it so now I am
going to blend out this with this and
maybe this with this let's get to
blending
I don't know which one I like more you
guys this one like really blend of that
concealer out nice just one did too this
one sorry I don't know why I just went
over that it's like habit alright let's
look at the concealer and see how it
worked with the foe foundation
foe filter excuse me oh my god this one
definitely applied the concealer like
thicker and it's brighter under my eye
that is a tray okay well that's fine
that's good to know
huh that's tripping me out look at that
one's like minus ones like next step we
are of course going to set our under
eyes with a little bit of lemare the
powder now my trick that I love to do is
take a smaller artiste brush which one
is this the oval 7 and I like to just
dip right in I love a wet Beauty Blender
as well but this to pack into the skin
if you really want to beat the face just
press that right in the eye and right
into the skin not in your eye unless you
really want to have some pain but hey
and then for this side I will take the
Beautyblender since it is damp and that
is going to melt right into the
concealer and into the skin leaving it
full lawless alright you guys so I'm
going to go finish the rest of my face
I'm gonna go film another video and then
go out tonight to a concert and I'm
gonna be vlogging the whole time and
I'll do some check-in so you guys can
see how it really looks later right now
with the concealer and everything
blended it's looking pretty good and I
still smell the foundation a tiny bit
which is not the end of the world but I
know a lot of people out there have been
trying to shade the smell so I'm like I
got to see what this is about for myself
and yeah don't really mind it but it's
there just so everyone's aware alright
you guys so I will do some check-ins and
I will see you in a little bit hey you
guys alright got a new vlog camera let's
give this a whirl I am doing new
check-ins in foundation reviews so we
got the daylight in on my face it has
been about hour and 45 minutes since I
have applied of course I finished my
makeup and I'm actually in the middle of
another review and just for the record
it is about a hundred degrees today in
Calabasas California alright so back to
the foundation review is take a little
zoom in on my skin as you can see it is
very matte very pretty
only thing and who knows if it's the
primer or the foundation combination but
there are a few pores I noticed on my
nose that didn't really fill in which is
kind of rare for me but yes I do have
pores I am a normal person hey baby

tank right now we just got this bad
bitch installed what is it 340 gallon
saltwater

so cool so I am doing a foundation
review right now okay what do you think
of my skin I mean it looks pretty bad I
mean I'm I'm liking it looks very like

step away from the fish tank is it skin
like is it powdery is it really matte is
it shiny what's your what's your opinion
it's very matte to me it looks like like
your regular foundation almost mmhmm

a very full coverage foundation so I'm
giving it a whirl any cons that you see
