channel today is this highly requested a
little bit so in today's video and
finally doing the tag that has been sent
to me tweeting me snap to me over and
over the I do my boyfriend brothers
makeup challenge so hi this is Zack
what's up everybody okay young Zachary
so of course you guys know by now this
is Nev Kendra brother how old are you I
am 21
just turned 21 what's what's your sign
Capricorn so after I did Nate the makeup
everybody it was like okay who's next
so I know it's been a long time coming
thank you guys for being so patient but
I'm finally in town long enough to
finally do this challenge so I'm sure
they're going to ask a lot of questions
at home like base okay y'all this hair
explained me I'm taking this clip a lot
of people want to know have you ever
like try and make up for Halloween
costumes have you ever put on makeup in
general for fun to be funny or like ever
in your entire life actually this is
going to be my first time ever getting a
full face of makeup well I'm lucky
enough to have Jeffery doing so yes okay
so this is a little bit of a challenge
because if you guys are at home and you
already know if someone has never put on
makeup before can their face handle it
or the eyes gonna get crazy what's going
to happen but I guess that's the fun of
it so have you ever worn contact lenses
you know fuck me fuck my life okay so
the eyes might be a little tricky but I
mean that's going to be the fun part so
I have a lot of new makeup a lot of old
favorites that I'm going to use today on
back and I think we're just going to
dive right into it and let's see what
the hell happened so if you want to see
me transform Zach - keep on watching
so before we start anything before we
prime of course we're to ask my makeup
client what kind of skin do you think
you have I think it's fairly normal to
be honest it is pretty normal
yeah up close it's not oily like at all
and this is not dry there's no dry
patches so usually what I do um people
you guys I just kind of like seal around
the face
his skin honestly feels like mine which
is just a very normal
I'm purple I know they're going to read
me down okay so today for primer I have
something really exciting and new that
we're going to use today this is from
Bar Solly you may know them from all
over Instagram and they just launched in
Sephora and shit it just looks pretty so
they just launched this product called a
unicorn tears aka unicorn essence and
what this is I guess is like a serum in
enhancing like primer so we're going to
give it a whirl okay so we're going to
do a little cheer oh just got some on
the jacket great I already do this you
can't see it though oh you can't see it
when you get primer on someone's clothes
just apologize and keep it moving and I
always like to do makeup lemon neck now
we're going to take a little Gucci
foundation brush and I'm just going to
blend this all into his skin and get it
snatched
okay so prior to ever moving to
California did you take care of your
skin at all what was your skincare
regimen I mean really just basic stuff
like clean water
yeah just showering that's it normally
for Jesus we've been kind of working on
your skin okay all right now it's time
for some foundation so this basically is
going to make your skin look fucking
flawless it's back so we're made is a
skin caviar foundation with SPF 15 by
l'a curry
this is so amazing and I reviewed this
on my channel like a year ago almost oh
my god and it's one of my favorite
foundations it's like amazing Oh
actually you guys I'm going to mix
because I mixed on myself so this is
basically I'm going to do how I would do
my own makeup on him and I love mixing
this is a super spray so close your eyes
oh time to get that mannequin skin he's
like what the fuck is going on session
we're going to bum out in a second now
we're going to put this all over you
all right now we're going to take a
dancer Beautyblender and we're going to
buff it into the skin all right the
foundation is looking laid look at the
monitor spins like metal um crazy right
deborah concealer we're going to go in
with one of my favorites the
heart-shaped tape and we're going to
brighten now exactly doesn't need
concealed areas like a little
discoloration under the eyes but
definitely normal so forever out there
that doesn't know where are you from
Michigan Grand Rapids Michigan you grow
revenues I personally love it out there
shout out to everyone in Michigan oh
look everybody it's already little water
anger eyes are like we've never had this
shit close so we're going to set the
under eyes before based on creasing
we're going to use the alum mayor of the
powder this is looking the best you
owners really so you see so this is what
men do they move their for it a lot and
and you girls already know we've got to
fix that creasing all right so with
today we're going to contour to fill and
working is a little lorac pro contour
book BAM I'm going with a medium color
for him and I'm just going to use this
little more D five to seven brush so now
we're gonna I mean your your jeans like
your family I such strong jaws we really
don't meet contour like your jaw could
literally cut someone in half but we're
just gonna really chisel that out today
so when you were growing up two people
ever say you and Nate looked a lot of
like or not until recently oh yeah no
it's we've got our whole life okay thank
you for all that you know for twins or
not yeah in that Botox video with me so
many people thought you guys are like
twins
I mean you guys look similar the brows a
jaw the cheekbones but I don't think you
guys are like 20 yeah I don't know how
many people were like didn't each type
long hair and then pink and I'm like I
think are that similar alright so do you
feel that we can conquer the know
you can make it look smaller larger now
I'm using a makeup brush I had no
product on it this is just a little Mac
- - for blending one of my favorite
alright I'm actually going to switch my
idea and just use this makeup forever
fan brush it's like really quick and
easy all you got to do is I go down the
nose like really one two three BAM and
then just use it you guys already know I
love to go back and forth with powders
and we're going to hit this beige color
and then we're just going to go right
over that so the lines are not as severe
but if you want to be your contour go
ahead girl do you I think we're going to
the brows quickly and then we're going
to do a little highlight what you
normally do on yourself because kind of
tweeze sometimes just weasel cute mochi
you need like prime eyebrows they're
very like yeah like a arch already some
people just have like caterpillars but
yours has is like I'll kill you and your
whole family vibe oh where could he used
the on estancia Beverly Hills brow
definer now he does not really light
hair but dark brows so I'm going to pick
a shade that is not black or granted
this is you chocolate now you guys see
look in the camera a little bit
he does have a little bit of sparseness
here that just have your eyebrows always
been yeah you're not getting that like
hit yourself ever the notes card you get
is no scar how a group alright cool
all right so now that the browser is
done I'm just going to make sure all the
foundation and pattern everything is
just flawless so we're gonna have to
close your eyes and just do a little mac
fix+
my tried and true it feels good right
smooth refreshing now we're going to add
a tiny bit of color to Zach's cheek so
we're gonna go in with the NARS this is
the new one is called bumpy ride and
okay so we're gonna highlight I'm
getting the giggles and we're gonna go
in with a little peach goddess from its
brand I've never heard of before do a
little glow time yeah extreme shine okay
but on a personal level do you like
girls that wear a lot of makeup or do
you lard do you like the natural look
honestly I'm kind of into that natural
look yeah I don't mind like if you like
to get dressy up and like get the makeup
alright I feel nice and pretty every now
and then but normally I was like just
more natural so a lot of people were
tweeting me and asking me a lot of
questions so this is going to be like a
Barbara Walters interview right now you
ready for it let's go okay so number one
most requested question is is that
single and single that is single so for
everyone that can't have made out there
Dean Zach just kidding but okay okay
that's cool so I mean I mean how are you
in London California I really AM it
there's just so many different types of
people out here like every really great
beyond yeah there's a million different
cultures out here which I think it's
pretty cool it's very eclectic obviously
we have bomb weather oh yeah it's so
glad to get out of the winter did you
love the snowstorms and hitting ice off
your windows in the morning or what no
the only thing I liked about winner is
snowboarding but oh and that yeah I
could do without watching I can just go
up two hours north right whenever I know
in Big Bear which is one of my favorite
spots you haven't gone there yet
oh yeah we're going to take you so we're
going to dip into the honest hasta
gurbles Nicole Guerrero highlighting
palette voila and we're going to dip
into she ate kitty cat which is my
favorite shade from this palette I think
I'm going to hit pan
very soon I saw with double highlights
give your face an extra like holy shit
so we are highlighted everything looks
amazing and now we're gonna oh my god
we're going to say silent prayer
together and we're going to try to do
some sort of eye shadow so of course we
have to use the new androgyny palette
now of course you can create so many
endless smokey eyes with this so I know
if we're going to get a full smokey eye
at exact Seoul today but we're going to
try if we're going to go in with of
course the trusty Paint Pot paint relief
from Mac just basically makes your eye
shadow stay on all day that creasing for
everyone out there that doesn't know
Zack worked at my warehouse so if you
bought in lipsticks Zacks probably
passed it or helped pack it but well
straight into you I don't know I'm
really trying to get in the group of
things so I'm not a huge like going out
person going to flowers I'm not a huge
drinker more like relaxed kind of like
we all like to stay chill yeah so they
might shock people I think a lot of
people maybe think we're like partier we
go out all the time over really like
into watching movies all the time they
play a lot of video games a little bit
what's your what's your favorite game
you guys play so many games you guys I
don't even know yeah I don't have like a
sugar favorite I mean old-school Kingdom
Hearts number one
oh okay I don't know that is I'm all
Nintendo 64 for me don't get long haha
Super Mario yeah super any time it was
my shit back in the day
Street Fighter more combat y'all want to
come be on Mortal Kombat Oh Jack also
really loves music music festivals are
the best this summer in June I'm
actually going to be going to electric
forest just to be my second year and I
looks like a huge festival right so for
no one like I really know what that is I
just kind of learned about it so it's
like a huge is outdoor right okay and
what do you do is a compl engine
different stages show up set up your
tent there's like fields of tents then
you actually get to walk all the way to
the gates to get into the venue's oh if
you camp outside of it oh oh my god oh I
can't go I'm doing VidCon this year
everybody if you didn't already know
that's just a quick announcement I will
be doing panels and guests speaking at
VidCon in Anaheim California or I want
to go in with you
that sounds really bomb I know you all
don't think I can be in a tent in the
wilderness but camps before it's fun
accessible experience and you get to
meet a lot of new people so we recording
to dip into shade charm and let's see
what happens okay look down it's
probably easy
sounds like your eyes are going to water
looking down you never know so yeah
chill right there and let's see what
happen if you guys didn't know you can
of course use any powder for eye shadows
I love you can contour sometimes for a
crease and I'm just going to use this
light highlighting shade to diffuse okay
now guys we are going to deepen the
crease a little bit now look down to his
eyes you guys they're not like a sunken
in his minor like as deep-set but they
are a little deep set don't come out
it's almost like it's a little tricky so
with this we're going to take this tiny
little Cosette brush and then we're
going to just interest rate dominatrix
really lightly okay so we are just going
to blend this and it's coming together
so we're going to go back in with charm
just kind of soften that all right now
we are going to add some is glittered
upon my elated it looks pretty baller
this is rose gold retro magnificent
metals glitter and glow liquid eyeshadow
this was from Stila I'm obsessed with
these I think the whole era is you have
not tried them out yet I am obsessed I
can't stop wearing them now I'm just
going to apply this with the wand
fucking ring
Oh back looks cool like blinding okay so
a lot of people this is like the main
event question which i think is so
annoying but people want to know what's
your sexuality straight are you what are
you to be honest I'm not really into the
whole like gentrifying people's feelings
and emotions I really think that's huge
way everyone always wants a label which
gets so annoying yeah because you know
me an angel without all the time
I do definitely all the time and it's
like people just like crave labels
well I'm attracted to women but I feel
like anything can really happen like
emotions and feelings can happen between
anybody definitely down the road like
who am I to say what I'm gonna like down
the road right you can't predict life
really like I mean I think your brother
is a good example so I think a lot of
people also we're asking like what does
that think when they first said like hey
like I'm dating JEP radiant like you
know how did it first come about if you
don't mind me asking when you look down
to you yeah at first I didn't actually
know anything about you I wasn't really
into the whole myspace thing so it
wasn't really there for that I was a
little shocked just because he's been
with women like his entire life exactly
so I would put some people don't believe
I'm like Nate only dated women before me
it was probably a little shocked to hear
like hey so what did he say like him
kind of Gogoi California instantly went
into like protective mode make sure like
who it was like he's not flying out to
see some random person yeah some whole
online so the ones we showed you me and
you're like oh like that's not a check
right what was your first thought to be
honest I was just taken back but he
seemed really happy so like yeah I was
just happy for him I really wanted to go
out and find out like fine calling he
actually liked yeah so when we came home
like the first few times how was it like
to do you ask me thing or you just like
hand over time I had so many questions
yeah I was not going to be able to fly
on the wall like an interview I just
have a sense that you guys really like
connected I can tell just from being out
here you guys are really like the same
person like yeah I can see each other in
both of you and I love it I love the
connection but I feel the bond oh yeah
it's awesome
did you like ever have a talk with your
parents about me ever or like what
think about me before I method because
once I met them they were so chill and
non-judgmental really cool so normal and
you guys all made me feel like I was at
home the first time I ever came over and
I was a little scared like obviously I'm
walking into normal family like oh my
syndrome or you don't I mean I've seen
some gothic mothers out there online
y'all are crazy
but like you know said normal family and
I'm like you know I I'm a little
different so I don't know what to expect
when I first flew to Michigan honestly I
thought the same thing I wasn't really
sure how they would react but I like
pretty much was weighted out I wanted to
see the reaction myself just like you
like yeah yeah and that's it was cool it
turned out really well yeah all right
half the battle is over
so liner in the waterline oh my god you
guys pray everyone needs to pause this
video and say a prayer before whatever
happens next
alright now we're going to time to do a
little bit of under eye shadow so we're
going to go back to Judy and drogyny
palette and we're going to play with
charm and fetish and I'm going to use
tiny brushes let's see what happens if
your eye starts to water or I hate for
me to something no like that like right
now whew okay so normally you're not
around the crazy Beauty lights and I
have a lot of fucking lights here so
we're gonna turn off with you we're
probably going to like look really like
silhouette II but I'm just going to see
what happens if we turn off some of the
light and then oh look at a high light
though bitch
why okay let's see what happened it was
time you look up any light bothering it
and it'll turn your little bit of charm
under here and then we'll call it a day
for this step the waterline I already
know you guys is not happening but we'll
just you know we'll do it for a laugh
we're just going to try it you guys this
was fun
now I am going to take a little bit of
beat I love this color pop liner
probably not going to go on your eye but
hey we're going to give it a world here
we go this is a very interesting but I
was like no bitch back up
cuz why don't I even hard to pull down
you guys it's like not having it so I
think that's all we're going to get out
of that eyeliner you did a good job
though it's fucking hard
yeah I'm trying alright lights on BAM
now I wanted to do more on the lash line
like maybe a little bit of little bit of
dominatrix maybe a little bit of fetish
so we're going to do this really quickly
before that kills me so we're going to
look up pool all right now then only
part of the eye that we have left is
mascara
I'm sucking the bottom wilt mascara I
don't even know if that's possible but
we're going to attempt to put on the top
mascara all right so now we're going to
come to some bottom mascara dries to a
little heavy a little bit all right
before we finish sighs I'm actually just
going to do a little bit of that inner
corner of highlights like a little bit
of extra blinding and I'm going to go
back to the Nicole Guerrero in a
saucepan moment switch brushes just
going to go in the inner corner of your
eye really quickly one more time look up
and then your eye is just being abused
all right you guys so since this look is
a little similar to mine I'm going to go
in with the Tom Ford blush nude lipstick
this is what I'm wearing today
now Tom Ford is like I think one of the
best lipstick formulas I love it it is
gorgeous now let's see what happens
all right now I think to complete this
look we're going to do a little bit of
some gloss I'm going to go in with the
usual a cosmetics lip stopper and shade
skinny-dip BAM
so besides that we are going to do some
setting spray and this look is almost
complete you guys I can't believe it
alright you're going to close your eyes
and I'm just going to set this makeup
watch the hair this will feel a little
cooling BAM we're going to give you a
quick shower and we're just going to let
that soak in oh how are you guys we made
it through we made it through this
journey how do you how do you feel with
your overall thoughts opinions comment
section down below
I can't imagine people of trying to do
this every day a little much for me yeah
a little heavy on the eyes yeah so now
we all know that the back is not into
makeup around the eyes which is great
and I don't know let me do it in the
video or tell Elena I don't picture Zack
wearing makeup but it was fun experience
yeah definitely you actually beat your
brother because that little bugger shed
some damn tears that did not he beat the
challenge of no tearing up thank you
Jesus so you're right you start really
nice yeah you're great so thank you so
much for coming on my channel thank you
for having me of course and if you guys
want I mean Zack you don't have you what
do you have if you look at volume on you
have Instagram and snapchat really right
pretty much it I have a Twitter I'm not
a huge tweeter though so I wouldn't yeah
and you have any you don't have a
youtube channel there's are any people
