what's going on are you ready for today
I'm so ready this is gonna be an
experience better so since I started to
do makeup videos nathan has the
number-one most viewed makeup related
video on my channel which was where he
did my makeup so it's only fair that I
do his now we asked everybody on Twitter
snapchat Instagram what videos you guys
wanted to see next I got such a big
response to do your face yes it was
crazy
I was like I'm down whenever whenever
you're ready so have you ever won't make
it before that's gonna be a big question
buddy I have never worn any makeup I had
someone trying for eyeliner on me once
at Halloween or something yeah so okay
we're gonna talk about the one
stipulation that Nathan said he said I'm
down to film this but what you say the
waterline I can't do I can't do this hit
puberty and I don't what he can his eye
your body got scared when you heard the
water yeah oh that so we'll skip black
liner inside but we're doing some full
smokey eye today if you're down I'm so
down we'll see how much we'll see how
much your eyes see how much we get
abused his eyeballs today I don't really
know what kind of like I'm gonna go for
I'm just gonna dive in right now and I'm
gonna do his face makeup how I do my own
so if you need an extra reminder on how
I beat this mannequin mug then now
you're about to get a refresh but um I
think we should dive in right now I'm
ready oh I scared to start it off now
Nathan has like oily combination skin so
I'm gonna do um oh my god I keep
forgetting okay Nathan just got
Invisalign just in case
I feel like this bouncing off the Beauty
lights it's like what ya kisti yeah so
I'm gonna be using the tatcha luminous
dewy skin mist and we're just gonna get
you a little moisturized now I love the
stuff because even if you have normal
oily dry it just works good for
everybody and Nathan needs to be a
glowing angel today mm-hmm does he not
look like the guy from tangle anybody
please leave us some feedback below and
validate me okay so I'm gonna be using
this glam glow glow starter it's like a
mega illuminating moisturizer Oh
heaven to me gonna use a little damp
beauty blender so we're just gonna blend
that all over and get that glow from
within all right now for a foundation
today Nathan only deserves the best so
we're gonna be using the new Tom Ford
this is the traceless perfecting
foundation I've been using this a lot
lately and then of course Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation which is my
favorite favorite paper blue silk we're
gonna give you a full mass okay it's
actually not a bad match relax your face
don't
how does it feel so far anything do I
look like a mannequin yeah you look
really airbrush and this is just the
beginning how does it feel I don't feel
like there's anything on my face okay
well you better work than Armani
maybe like a moisturizer or something
that I put on right nothing crazy yeah
no there's something all right
kill it for concealer what are we gonna
do today I think we're gonna do what Sam
urban decay naked skin he's like what
the fuck is this I know isn't this goes
on your eyes yet yes sir look up oh
right
you better work concealer we're just
gonna do a little drama today a lot of
bouncing huh
not bouncing okay so we're gonna set
that under I really quickly because
nathan is gonna crease on us
we're gonna do a little Laura Mercier
translucent powder and we're just gonna
dip into there
look up sir thank you now notice how I
really didn't conceal anything else on
Nathan he skin is really great and for
highlighting I'm going to just stick
with metallic and not do anything really
crazy on him so I'm sure somebody were
like wait a minute now we're gonna take
this huge lemear brush we're just gonna
dip into a little studio fix and we're
just gonna pack this on the entire face
all right yes you are on your way to
becoming America's next drag superstar
all right now for contour I'm going to
be using the Tarte tardes contour little
book now the smell is like oh like
almost like creme brulee vanilla e
chocolaty delicious right
now I love this palette because it is
really like it gives you really good
coverage but it's really light it
doesn't look too kruky
now Nathan has a really great hairline
you don't need no surgery you don't need
nothing so we're just gonna do a little
Thank You jeans right come on parents
Nathan and his dad are like twins by the
way please go on my Instagram and take a
look it's crazy
going in for just give me a little
bronzy summer look all right now we're
going to really cut that jawline all
right now I'm gonna be using that
artiste oval 3 and we're just gonna do a
little contour on that nose the
brochures are so cool look Sedova
and we're just gonna do some harsh lines
here and of course blend them out but
I'm just gonna show you for effect we're
going in the nose
look in the camera yes Manny you better
work your nose looks like Manny when he
contours I'm livin you probably would
notice his college or since we're always
naked
okay so family joke
we're not letting Nathan peek by the way
so he's only allowed to look in the
camera I put a monitor behind his head
so I can see what the hell we look like
all right now what are we gonna do for
highlighting um down for the land or
snow a little skin cross yeah okay let
me try to look for it here that's peach
where she yeah here we go here hold that
one for highlighting we're gonna be
using a little morphe 310 today with
some lavender snow skin frost
oh okay Michigan made baby yes look at
Nathan's she gets like like an EMT and
we're gonna bring it all the way up into
the hairline so those baby hairs can
shine oh my god
we're gonna do a little bit on your nose
got to keep it really hood right now
it's about oh we're gonna do them keep
this go but I want to get the end of
that nose bitch yes okay I'll just tone
that down a little bit I'm trying to
give you some like extreme Mean Girls
glow okay
now we'll do a little Cupid's bow okay
what do you face from here to keep us
bow don't really work that much I was
gonna say nothing so I just hid mine a
little bit I was singing it really I was
like actually I don't really don't like
yeah you know it kind of works right in
the middle maybe no I'm just gonna put a
little bell the top of your lip my nails
I know I'm just gonna hit your forehead
a little bit let that bitch blow am i
blowing for the gong he's glowing bitch
now we're gonna do a little bit of
yelling back mm-hmm just adding a little
bit more that in there boom all right
now for brows today I'm gonna be using a
little uh Nastasia brow definer which
shade is this this is soft brown come on
soft
come on soft brown now Nate's eyebrows
are really flaky already so I'm just
gonna be adding in some definition and
giving him some androgynous brows it's
so weird to see how with the thicker
brow this thicker a little bit this is
you have to fill in the sparseness yeah
so like to you it's gonna look a little
thick in the front but like since I have
no hair my brows I don't really get to
use these that often I made you like to
sketch them out but like just do them on
someone else these are like amazing now
I know why they're such a big hit I'm
like okay all right brows are looking
full leakey better work Wolverine all
right guys let's dive into eyes so I'm
gonna be using a little urban decay
primer potion this is to make sure your
lids don't move since your skin is a
little oily we're just gonna dot a
little bit only
and then we're gonna blend that out with
the brush so don't stab you with my
nails alrighty now we're just gonna
blend that out so this is how I feel
every single day it's not bad huh not
too bad so how do you each with makeup
on like if your eye itches right here oh
it just right there yeah you take a nail
and you just like this yeah keep doing
it ha ha ha ha or you can take the goal
