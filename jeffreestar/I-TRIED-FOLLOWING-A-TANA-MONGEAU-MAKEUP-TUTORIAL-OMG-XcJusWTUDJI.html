alright y'all hi what's up everybody
welcome back to my channel so you
probably are asking yourselves what the
hell are we doing here today
so a youtuber named Thomas Halbert
recently created a new we'll call it a
challenge type of video where he follows
a tutorial from another Beauty
influencer or youtuber and he literally
followed the entire tutorial from start
to finish and recreated the look and
followed all the steps now you may be
asking yourselves wait a minute I think
I heard you mention this before yes this
is the video in question and yes he
followed one of my tutorials now me and
Thomas have not always been cool with
each other but hey baby it's a new year
we DM each other and we are all good so
if anyone wants to start any drama
there's not any sorry to break the news
to you but I thought that his video idea
was a really fucking funny and I'm like
ok cool we got to do this and I just
thought the gabbie show did one and I'm
like ok baby
I'm hopping on so I asked you guys
yesterday on snapchat
who should I follow like what influencer
and I did a poll on Twitter which girl a
lot of you guys voted so we ended it
like a few hours ago right here so the
people have spoken the votes are in and
you guys picked 10 emoji for me to
follow so baby I am here right now we
are going to put one of her tutorials up
here on the screen and we're just gonna
follow along so let me type in YouTube
here so one of the most popular ones
looks like the how to cake your face
like a pro the trilogy bitch has over 5
million views on this oh ok this makeup
look looks cute alright now me and Tana
have actually never met yet which girl
when are we filming come over but we
have DM each other we know each other
we're cool with each other so I was
really happy that you guys picked Anne
and I James Charles would have been
amazing as well and if you guys liked
this one maybe I'll do another one but
me and Tana we've never hung out yeah
and I'm like
bitch I look for your personality she's
uh kind of always stoned like me so I'm
down so before this video I got very lit
we're about to dive in and see if
Jeffrey star can KQ space lega pro
seductive there's an STD ad for Durex
condoms BC right before this video that
about sums up Tana Moshe alright now
that we've gotten through that ad hey we
got to pay our rent baby now we are
going to there's hair in my eye from
this jacket I'm going blind
oh this makeup look is cute really good
turning myself into a reasonable
unfuckable 5 to looking like a naked
fucking moron that no one would put
their genitals near even if you paid
them um I can relate to that mole-rat
check I've been called that a lot
recently on the internet because I have
no eyebrows so clearly we don't real we
all see about that baby
seeing you guys try out this makeup look
or trial products but I love and this
video was a lot of fun to make and I
really hope you alright let's jump into
the tutorial would you wash your hands
when you could just like not okay so she
wants to wash her hands before applying
the makeup and she uses an incisor
instead girl I am NOT even gonna wash my
hands like I'm good
my hands are clean and I'm ready to roll
well that was a crazy noise and also you
guys I tried to mimic her backdrop but
none of the walls in my house had skid
marks on them and my iPhone chords don't
hang from my wall but I tried first base
primer spray okay so we're gonna prime
the skin I actually don't have that but
it has the word base in it so I'm gonna
go in with my favorite Bobbi Brown a
vitamin enriched face base and this is
my tried-and-true so I see her spring in
which I love but we are just gonna use a
damp Beauty sponge so we're just gonna
coat our entire face and try to get some
moisture and this dry skin it's really
cool so I keep using it it might just
see like water have you guys seen those
bottles of Evian things on Sephora and
it's literally just water spray
that's like $10 like it's literally like
the only ingredient is water and it's
like refreshing face like like it's
water but you can literally put water in
like a spray bottle and then they sell
for like $10
I don't know who is dumb enough to use
that shit then you're gonna use a
benefit Porefessional I really like this
stuff cuz that really big pores because
I constantly pop blackheads watch sick
bitch would it be clean just look at
that okay well um I pick my skin too
honestly
so I have that primer actually have the
new one this is the pearl pore fessional
version that just has a little bit of a
sheen to it so let's okay you guys
there's so much hair in my mouth which
normally it's from like a ball sack so
I'm just gonna take this jacket off
because bitch alright so now we are
going to take the primer Oh mine's not
even oh it's not even open yet way too
much of this on your hand like way too
fucking much of this and you're gonna
put it everywhere because there's not
one part of my skin that doesn't have
like giant pores my skin has gotten so
much clearer since the first time I film
these videos I must say and that's
because I have a good skincare routine
that I do like once a week because this
literally is like primer that you can
ever buy ever I'd like every other
primer is so shitty compared to this
primer so highly Carl this is actually
an amazing primer so I'm down for this
no let me get this all over my face and
neck PDQ three foundations that I was
obsessed with and I went on and on and
on telling you guys how I would never
ever ever use another
and then I found this foundation sort of
though do I have not one not oh she
likes him Boca bridge loved it so much
this is the know this video was like a
year ago so that foundation is so full
coverage my bottles from that we're
actually leaking in my drawer so I sadly
threw those away don't have them but I
will use something that is very full
coverage as well okay let's see how she
applies it yes girl that's gonna cover
your attitude it's gonna cover up your
past just gonna cover up blasts STD you
had baby I feel you
I'll do you one that I used to use it's
super thin consistency like a
moisturizer but then it covers
everything and it stays on for like 24
hours it's not drying like it does 24
hours can I swear to god you better be
washing and that makeup off every night
which what I have a sick feeling you
don't okay so we're gonna use a lot of
foundation that's what she loves and
want so we are going to go in with the
very full coverage hourglass all ours a
foundation one of my favorites over the
last few months it covers a lot to makes
you look very plastic and fake which I
live for so let's do it
I'm suing Tana this foundation just
squirted and got on one of my Perkins
see that right there girl
oh my god all right so uh oh end barely
got on my hand I think it was stuck why
it's so what's good let's try that again
that was scary
alright so I am going to take what shade
what shades of my BR forty and BD twenty
and we're just gonna do a little mixing
and matching and she's putting it all
over her face
so let's see how she blends it out you
just said never do your eyebrows I love
that I kind of want to see her junior
eyebrows off but no I don't I'm looking
like why the fuck do people
oh just fucked up her shirt it doesn't
give a fuck and that's a boy I think
I've lived for this bitch because you're
a fake spigen bitch there's also a giant
gash in my beauty blender because lumen
tried to eat this one okay that gash in
the beauty blender there could be
bacteria hidden in there baby you need
to throw that away and get yourself a
new one
oh girl into my skin you want to make
sure that your beauty blender is damped
and this looks so much better than any
other brush cuz brushes cement a
profound Shirley Street heat okay the
fact that she's taking the Beauty
Blender and just smearing it down
instead of buffing it is giving me so
much life okay Tana we're gonna take the
Beauty Blender and we're gonna balance
our foundation into her skin and we're
gonna look flawless because the bat that
streaky method girl uh-uh so I'm trying
to rub it down like she did girl it's
looking streaky I don't know about this
technique girl I'm just gonna go right
over grandma right there I don't know
pulling down is good it might make you
age a little quicker okay I mean I love
that she does not want her makeup
streaky but blinding it again I'm like I
don't know if that's necessary this is a
stuff for a brush and let's blend with
her streaks or like anything like that I
like it to look super look seamless
what does foundation I don't need an
under-eye concealer because it covers so
well like it makes me
yeah same thing god I thought she was
about to say we're gonna skip concealer
and I was gonna be like okay so let's
see what her favorite concealer is well
I definitely have the age rewind I
literally did a full face maybelline
video and I've used this a few times the
reason why I don't use it a lot is
because they don't have a shade light
enough for me
so we will use this and maybe a little
bit of something else okay so we're
gonna do a highlighted effect hi can
this concealer come out hello oh there's
some I remember I really liked the
formula of this but I don't think I was
living for the shade she wants to put
everywhere where you're gonna highlight
the face and she puts on acne I don't
have any pimples today which is shocking
so we're just gonna draw this on just
like this all right so she is about to
do setting powder so let me blend out
this concealer and see how we're looking
oh right we are buffed out this actually
looks really creamy I kind of forgot
that I liked his concealer so I think
maybe but she is about to set her face
with Laura Mercier I can already see it
by her hands BAM of course I have that
so let's see how she likes to apply it
it was it definitely was
she literally okay okay okay she
literally took a huge powder brush just
literally dips in and like oh my god
that's a lot of product and she
literally just went she went and y'all I
tried to play me the contour actually
used to use that palette it was one of
the best formulas okay we're fast
forwarding your contour but let me
finish that my face it's me
George Washington okay so we are going
to do the three that she meant Anna said
using the lemare bronzer I love this one
and we're just going to go really hard
in there what she is saying is we're
just gonna take our brush and go with
like the number three like that of
course you want to buff and blend it
into the skin I put in a lot so I'm
about to diffuse it a little bit but
girl that is what she is talking about
so a lot of people do like the forehead
the cheek all the way to the jaw of
course but I'm just gonna take this
brush and push it up and into the skin
and if it looks muddy like that just to
fuse it with a Beauty Blender or a brush
but let's see how else does she uses
this
girl white and then I do my brows then I
do like banana powder okay so she puts
the banana powder on top of the
concealer oh my god okay I am like too
fair for banana powder but we will see
here what happens
so banana powder is way too yellow for
my pale ass so we're going to skip that
step and let's see what is next bitch
when I was in high school there was no
naked palettes ever but there was herb
indications just gonna fill in her brows
since she doesn't really pluck or give a
fuck about her brows I'm just gonna
leave mine how they are and let's go
right - okay so I reviewed that palette
like right around that time this came
out like a year ago
I don't know where it is but today we
are going to pull out be brand new on a
saucy Beverly Hills soft glam eyeshadow
palette it looks like this and I think
there is colors comparable to what she
is about to do so let's see how she is
gonna do her eyes today
hopefully it looks good but I don't
think I'm comfortably good enough at
eyeshadow yet or I can explain to you
guys like how to do it and like be
confident in it like I feel like I'm
gonna get a lot of heat like oh my god
that shadow sucks about the fact that
she thought this was like a tutorial
like when I got Mitch so this is how so
fucking real I don't give a fuck
whatever you whatever your opinion on
her is it's just so fucking real like
myself I'm fucking living the orange in
the middle oh she's just pulling that
skin bag let's just grab a shadow brush
and we will dip into so let's see let's
do burnt orange and orange soda and she
literally just fucking pop that right
into her crease so let's see what
happens
now honestly I feel like a super
beginner and I chat up and you want to
just ease into it
uh-huh totally just put a transition
color like this in the crease blend it
out really well and then just put like a
white or like a shimmery color all over
your lid and then put on like lashes and
eyeliner and I still think that that
looks really really pretty
I'm like that purple how beauty girls I
mean that's actually some real advice
this white color and put this all in the
inner corner oh okay so usually I would
do a light base all over the lid and
then go in with these shades cuz it
would already make it I think blend
extra crazy but hey if that's how she
does a bitch that's how she does it so
let me finish off of this transition
shade and let's pop in that white
alright so we are going to just go into
the top shade up here the tempura and I
think she's using a brush kind of like
this and let's see how she applies it oh
oh okay okay okay okay
she's already going to the middle so
we're just gonna take that shade and
we're gonna put it all in there just
like she did and she did it right there
almost like a little halo moment cute
alright now she's ready for the middle
she just took like a shimmery basic ass
shade and just plopped it right in the
middle I couldn't even really see it
Tanna what happened there okay so I'm
just gonna put the shade bronze up here
and she used the same brush so I'm gonna
use the same brush and we're just gonna
dip right in there and we'll just pack
some right in the middle just a little
BAM right in there okay so we'll take
the shade rustic right here and then
she's using the same brush so one two
three BAM that's easy-peasy and she was
doing it on the outer edges right about
there I mean I'm not even mad about this
look right now let me see how far she
takes it down
she took that color that's like on top
of her I didn't see like what under her
yes she's a innovative queen oh she's
doing it on herself that is some Realty
right there all right let me finish
blending and this bitch is ready to go
on liners slow it down yeah I must say
before you guys do not share eyeliner
with your sister mother or friends you
never know what someone's I've been
doing at home with their eyeballs okay I
am using the Tom Ford eye defining pen
we've all been there oh she's already on
lashes fuck she's quick okay so we're
just gonna do our liner real quickly and
let's see how she's gonna look i aligner
is done now it looks like she is ready
for lashes so let's see what kind
I'm fuckin deceased right now dry
fucking clear it dries like clear mixing
their foundation and then it looks like
someone came in your eye
if fuckin sucks and it burns
okay so I don't even have a black duo I
literally only have the clear so I'm
gonna have calm eyes today which nothing
new but okay let me trim down these
lashes and let's apply them all right
we're gonna coat the lash band lash band
and I see Tanna
right now so let's see what she's doing
okay we're blowing on the lash and she
just popped that right on and work yes
you know maybe the fact that she didn't
do mascara first I'm shocked all right
we're popping this on and then we'll
figure it out
all right this feels so weird with
having no mascara on this is very weird
all right what is the next girl I'm
scared just to blend your real eyelashes
with your fake eyelashes I think that it
looks a million time
or before girl know that formula is so
wet and clumpy it literally looks like
you've got face fucked and your mascara
is like do not recommend that we're
gonna stick to our iconic benefit roller
lash but let's see what she does
Oh what about dick Oh what did she say
about dick girl that's my specialty what
do you got to say about some penis baby
Oh same here baby but sucking since I
was 12
oh okay
you weren't so horny are you a Scorpio
what's tinier you Tana I need to know
okay so she literally just did off
camera so let me I guess do this mascara
and the other lash and I'll be right
back all right lashes are on
let's see what's next why what's oh she
has a MAC lipstick oh my god I want to
go to her house and clean her entire I
can make a place Oh immaculate okay what
is this one all right Nikki's dude we're
just gonna put that on it's kind of a
similar shade to what she's wearing and
kind of all right let's see what all she
says this is the only lipstick that I
really wear it's only one that I think
looks that good on me NYX matte finish
setting spray and it's awesome
I used to use like expensive ones like
the makeup for everyone this is
literally like six bucks all right so
she does a setting spray thank God
because I'm depressed you guys know
highlight Tana what the fuck happened
all right let me finish this blip stick
and then go cry in the corner all right
so I'm gonna go in with the Urban Decay
all nighter setting spray and let's see
how she applies hers
all right so I'm gonna go in with the
Urban Decay all nighter setting spray
she did hers off-camera so let me just
spray my face all right we are set bitch
all right now what is next this is how
to get fucked if you're like a 6 or 7
like me I also really like the way the
eyeshadow turned out I think I'm gonna
wear this eye shadow a lot more because
cute
girl you talk about your pussy more than
me alright you guys so this is the final
look of Geoffrey start attempting to
follow a ten emoji makeup tutorial
bitch sound off below how do we feel I
actually kind of live for this look
because it's really simple and like just
a soft I mean honestly it sums up soft
glam to me I feel like I'm ready to go
to a wedding I feel like I'm ready to do
a bukkake I feel like me antennae are
about to go like have a crazy night
where we both somehow end up in the
women's jail and we're selling our souls
but all jokes aside this was actually a
really fun video to do I love how like
basic and minimalistic she is and she
just doesn't give up walk which is kind
of probably why it has 5 million views
all right you guys besides that I am
dying to have some highlighter on my
face I'm kind of upset about that
antenna you look good baby and I love
how this look turned out let me know
