hi guys today walk and suck actually I
wish I had long hair like Rihanna what's
up you guys welcome back to my channel
hi how are ya in today's video we're
going to do something a little different
than normal because I know that the I
tried following a makeup tutorial by the
trends a little over but guess what it's
back and in today's video I'm gonna be
following the brand new Rihanna's iconic
Vogue makeup tutorial know this hit the
internet a few days ago and everyone
went I never got so many funny ass jokes
from people writing all the beauty gurus
on YouTube going you're all cancelled
well today bitch we are not canceled but
we are gonna celebrate Rihanna's amazing
makeup tutorial and of course her brand
Fanta beauty now I am going to just play
along and try to follow exactly how
Rihanna does her tutorial now this
has over 6 million views everyone is
living for it and vogue you are really
smart for doing that because everyone is
not like Rihanna
please come on YouTube and do makeup
tutorials her voice is just so soothing
and I am definitely a fan of this videos
alright so I grabbed a bunch of products
that are in the video if there's
something that she is using that I don't
have I will substitute it for something
else of course so we are going to log in
here let's type in Rihanna's epic
10-minute guide to going out makeup
beauty secrets with vogue alright so I'm
just gonna go right into it and let's
start beating the space ok
so let's do it baby okay so she's
already jumping right into foundation by
the way I love that she's standing in a
random kitchen the lighting is like
perfect and her friends are behind her
laughing and like Chang her on it's kind
of like the best scenario ever so she
dives in right into her fancy foundation
which I do have my shades right here but
I need to climb because girl this skin
it needs some primer look at me I got a
pimple I got a razor burn and I got a
pore that's acting crazy I've never
looked this crazy before okay so for a
primer today we're gonna use the goochy
goochy face primer I love this one it's
the silk priming serum now I like to use
a lot and we're gonna take our little
morphe blending sponge and we're just
gonna apply this all over our entire
face and by the way you guys who else is
a living for all the new fancy stuff
like I know I reviewed the body lava The
Faerie BOM pom pom but I loved how much
stuff NT is coming out with they are
definitely not playing around and
there's definitely some sneak peeks of
new products in this vogue video which
of course I don't have yet can't wait to
get it so that will be fun to peek at
but alright we are fully primed now
let's see how she does her foundation oh
she just goes okay now there's a lot of
comments on this video saying Rihanna
didn't pick her foundation color right
but then when you go further into the
video the foundation I know everyone
hates the word oxidizes but the
foundation like Willy starts to morph
into her skin color and it looks
flawless to me so so if you've never
tried the Fenty Beauty Pro filter
foundation it is very quick to dry so I
like to shake it up and do just parts of
my face just like she did all right so
I'm just gonna mix shade 140 with 170 I
didn't use this in a while so let's see
what oh girl hi so let's see what
happens here
I can do my makeup in 10 minutes or 10
hours it feels like okay her eyes are so
pretty okay so she's like I could do my
makeup in 10 minutes or 10 hours I'm
like I think we can all relate to that
because sometimes we have like no time
to get ready and we just got a run and
I'm sure a lot of you are like girl to
Rihanna I'm sure she has a private
makeup artist personal on standby but
not everyone does you guys need me
surprised
Oh contour okay oh she's really down to
the ground it's like bitch I got a few
big forehead too I'm saying I do yes
okay I love this she said that she's
like don't contour how you see other
people do it do it for your face shape
but I think a lot of people to see like
a technique on someone and to kind of
follow that exactly but you do of course
want to do it to your own face shape now
I grabbed what is this Amber and mocha
I'm not sure which one to do this one is
a really cool tone which I don't mind so
maybe it'll go in this okay and let's
just go in and let's see how much she
does we got forehead she really goes in
and let's see what happens I hate to see
that white line between blend it bitch
contour always starts out looking
absolutely crazy yes it does
I love how excited she is about applying
the makeup Craig I love that Oh
Xuan had a contour when she gained away
I love that she's like I'm sorry I'm
just gonna keep it really real with you
guys okay now she used her face brush to
blend out I'm not the biggest fan of
that I just love beauty blenders for
creams so lets blend this out deeper
situations before I go in and make
highlight okay see we just said everyone
does it different well this is a little
messy I'm gonna handle that triangle
your neck situation just disappears
concealer this okay so before concealer
she does like a triangle I'm like girl I
love doing that now oh okay all right
everybody knows concealers made for
hiding bags and dark circles that's
right baby
we all have those I mean my favorite
date really depends on my mood depends
on the occasion it depends on how lazy
I'm feeling that day how much in rush I
am Hey determines what kind of makeup I
choose
okay so lets blend this out I love how
real she is like recently she told
everyone hey me and Drake aren't friends
and when he tried to give me that award
and confess his love wasn't into it I
was like like she is one of the realest
and I think that's why everyone just
 with her and respects her because
she don't play around
yes we are okay I love this one because
it doesn't leave a crazy cast over your
face
it's just kind of like more natural
which is good and anyone can use this
even her cream contour she sets it with
that I'm like okay honey we were gonna
put her right over there BAM and then
she goes in with a bronzer and warms up
her face now they don't say what brand
the bronzer is maybe it's something
they're working on you never know but
I'm gonna pull out my lemare bronzer one
of my favorites on the planet brand is
real the blade honeyed is real here okay
okay
oh she literally just did her brows off
camera okay yeah I love how like calm
and collected she sounds a lot of tips
there and I think the best teacher is
yourself you have to practice on your oh
yes my area things II can do better than
make the artist like there's a certain
point where they had to do something you
do it because there's there's one way
that you like it I'm always yeah thanks
is my brows she's particular about the
brows same I'm done with her I like
drama
oh I'll it drama okay so she literally
takes this brush contours the nose she
adds in more on the eye so let me bang
that out by the way who else is excited
for her brand like the future what's
gonna come out this year like I love on
a new brand launches because you get to
see them do so many new products and get
excited for them all I love that she
didn't release an entire full full line
where it's like so
overwhelming she's like slowly adding
stuff in and I think that it's amazing
Oh bitch please
okay so she's pulling out a brand new
highlighter oh okay so it's in this
component these are called the official
name of course the kilowatt freestyle
highlighter duo she has a new one that's
like a purple and orange of course I
don't have that yet because they heard
not out so she just takes a brush I
think that's actually Tom Ford or maybe
just morphe who knows okay so she's
taken some purple I love her friends are
behind her just gagging for her okay so
she's just putting some like purple on
the lids okay oh then she's taking some
my beautiful brown shade and putting it
around so we're just gonna take a little
bit of since I don't have those I'm just
gonna pull out the iconic blood-sugar
palette and I'm gonna dip into shader
root-canal real quick here with a little
more feet m-44 one brush and I'm just
gonna sweep it on my lid right there but
I'm not gonna make it like super bright
because she made it more muted
what kind of damn happy really
determines how I'm gonna apply this most
days you just want to go great by the
lashline a daily stare I've barely had
any sleep I'm gonna get all those little
bags right there but the creases they
show up if they're there they're gonna
show up
thanks yeah right they're so real no
yeah it's gonna blend the crease same
palette oh she's already highlighting
well wait okay so we're really gonna
cover some dark circles Lois just like I
haven't had much sleep I'm like can you
imagine her schedule y'all okay so I'm
gonna dip into blood sugar and tight
type in Wow all right I'm gonna dip into
ouch and intravenous and we're just
going to smoke out this lash line real
quickly all right so she grabs her
highlighter or palette that is not out
yet so we are just going to let's lose
gonna use a few her other ones you know
sometimes you're trying to give a little
natural vibe okay just wait like like
right now like I want to give you guys a
vibe
my vibe for summer is more is more more
is more I mean that's literally my
entire life so I'm so down for that
somehow imagine being that pretty
lowered okay so she does blush umm the
highlighter that's like that purple
shade looks so stunning on her I don't
have it yet so we're gonna dive into
some let's put some Gucci blush I mean
come on
you know RiRi is always wearing Gucci so
we're just gonna put some of this soft
peach color on here so I don't look so
dead come on revive me honey revive me
I know you guys notice that I've been
using this Ruby like breath this word so
I'd like to call my shark toothbrush but
it's the cheek hugging brush it's made
perfectly for your Cheetahs I want to
try some Oh another new palette that I
don't have oh that is blinding when it
goes bad like I'm really good yes every
beauty guru currently retiring right now
so time because it techniques but you
just have to figure out what kind of
look you're going for
yes you do okay giving me my libraries
the same brush yes okay we're gonna dip
into something that isn't out yet from
my brand since we don't have that
Rihanna palette and we're just gonna put
a little supreme skin frost right on top
of that venti look at that glitter and
glow honey
all right hers was like a full strip of
beauty and glow so we're gonna do the
same and then she's highlighting the
bridge of her nose so let's see how she
does that I'm like preach a little vest
I'm like oh my god okay I love her okay
so she literally took some like liquid
eyeshadow which i think is brand new
trend mood where you add back me up
which of course we don't have so I'm
just gonna take some Stila magnificent
metal of course her product and formula
are way different but this is all we got
so let's see how much she puts on just a
little inner corner moment inner corners
can be so fun you don't gotta do them
crazy you can literally just do that
just like RiRi and it's like hi hello
how are you
all right because that no Breanna is a
cush smoker like me we're gonna use the
brand new milk makeup cush mascara I
really love this I reviewed this a few
weeks ago and I am obsessed with this
formula it is really bomb come on
marijuana what's uh uh like dream goal
would be to however three ona
can you imagine I'm just get do makeup
and hang out like you know what I really
live for is that since venti has
launched last year so many brands are
now being judged for not having enough
foundation ranges for not being
inclusive and I love that Rihanna
release solidify that and opened up all
that conversation we all know about the
tart scandal that happened months ago
where they literally put out like two
shades for people of color and the whole
internet was like this is for real and
you know it just says a lot for
companies like if you don't want
everyone to wear your brand and not
everyone's gonna support it and you
might need to be called out for that so
it's just started a lot of hot topics
and conversations that I think are very
relevant and important when I put up my
foundation there definitely is going to
be a lot of shades and actually have
concealer coming out this year and no
there will not be sixteen shades there
will be like thirty so you know jeffree
star cosmetics ain't playin alright okay
let's another new product okay lip gloss
it says okay yes sounds like me every
time I see dick yeah she says you guys I
think I say about a lot okay to get the
same aspect I'm gonna go in with my
liquid lip shade birthday suit and then
we're gonna put a little bit of
pussy-whipped in the middle to get that
metallic little moment
okay girl thank you oh I can't
Oh Mike I have that robe oh okay body
lava I know you guys know about this
product okay let's do it
okay brushes because this is where the
magic is threshing behind the body lava
okay let me hear it I always used to go
to the Caribbean I mean oh my videos
weren't wrong and every single time I
would sit there and make body glitter
makeup okay
oil and eyeshadows that I crushed up
yeah pigments Sam and I would just blend
it all together to make this nice little
glowing thing and to keep it in like a
plastic cup of the whole trip I always
thought I could never find the perfect
body makeup yes bitch it is glorious
okay if you guys want to see my official
full-body love review I'm gonna link it
down below of course come on shameless
plug okay body lava is on do you guys
know how I feel about the formula if you
don't watch the video let's see how she
finishes is there a setting spray
Brianna do not do this to me where are
we going tonight hey I hope you enjoy my
tutorial because she's done oh my god
it's a wrap there is no setting spray
Brianna we're doing setting spray we
have to mama because that is not
acceptable we're gonna go with the Urban
Decay all nighter I think we're on a
house to setting spray I wish we knew
what brand maybe she's making her own
all right the space is now I'm very well
aware I will never be as pretty stunning
or as talented as Rihanna
I know bitch but hey a bitch can try
definitely needs those iconic James
Charles micro bleeding brows on me but
besides me looking like Marilyn Manson
and Barbie just had sex I actually
really like this look
now I'm gonna critique Rihanna because I
loved her techniques I loved that she
kept it simple and it was a really fun
video to follow I hope that she does
more tutorials because I just find her
voice so like calming I was like getting
in a trance and then I started to get
lit and more lit and I was like I'm up I
get it I'm on her level I feel it so
Rihanna please start a YouTube channel
can we do a change petition for that
please thank you all right you guys
thank you so much for watching today's
video I will see you on the next one bye
