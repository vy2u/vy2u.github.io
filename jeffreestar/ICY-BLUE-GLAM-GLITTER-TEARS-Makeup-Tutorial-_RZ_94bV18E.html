guess what I'm finally doing makeup
tutorials how long the guy's been
telling me to do these probably I don't
know ten years the look I'm going to do
for you guys today is a very signature
Geoffrey star look I have been wearing
bright blue shadow ever since I can
remember and it's just one of my go-to
colors a lot of people scream and run
away from it I'm like give me the blue
so today I wanted to do my little you
know Jeffrey crying glitter effect with
extreme highlight really bold eyes and
give a little soft nude lip so hope you
enjoy alright guys I'm gonna be doing a
crazy blue glitter fantasy glam look
today so just start that I like to put
eyeshadow right under my brow and bring
it almost all the way down to my lid so
with that I'm going to be using the busy
art matte palette this is the zero one
basic so great so I'm just going to take
this really light color is the lightest
one in the palette and I am going to
pack that under my brow now when we get
closer to the lid I'm going to be using
the second lightest nude shade and
bringing it all the way down to
basically my lash line so a lot of
people like to use primers this is
basically my primer and we're going to
bring it all the way to tail the brow
and a little past it
now next step is I'm going to take this
Kat Von D eyeshadow from her metal crush
collection this is called thunderstruck
and I love the shade you can even use it
as a highlighter I'm gonna pack this on
my eyes so with this Mac 210 brush I'm
going to pack on a lot of pigment and
I'm just going to take this color and
I'm gonna start blending it in the
corners of my eye and I'm gonna bring it
down like 30% for my eye so not in the
middle but 30% you know I'm going to
take this same color and bring it to the
top Acer's any fallout I'm just going to
lightly brush that away we have what I
like to call the base of the look down
now I'm just going to jump right into it
and take this bright blue eyeshadow
called afterparty from sugarpill I'm
gonna be blending out the blue with a
really light blue from honest hacia
called I see now for this look I'm going
to be using a lot of different eye
brushes we got a lot going on here so I
will be starting with the morphe
four-for-one brush and i'm gonna be
packing it on with this Chanel brush
number 19 and then I'm gonna be blending
it out a little bit with this Gucci
brush the blending number 20 see what
happens
alright now I'm going to be taking a map
2 to 4 brush and I'm going to be
blending the sugarpill blue with the
honest off SIA I see both on my brush so
I get a nice soft blend now you may
notice that I blow a lot on the brushes
if I was doing someone else's makeup
blowing is prohibited unless they're
paying you extra but for real I would
only blow on my brushes because they are
mine and I can and it is to avoid a lot
of fallout because I have all of this
pretty foundation on so
you see me going that's exactly what I'm
doing I am blowing cool now I'm going to
take I see shadow by itself and just
kind of these edges now I'm going
to take this on a stop see a shadow in
star kobold and I'm going to pack it on
a little bit on my lid for some
definition and we're just packing
alright now we're going to go back to
our blending brush take a little bit
more of that light light blue on the
bristles and we're just going to go over
the dark so they all come together like
besties there we go now before I do the
under I add a little bit more of that
thunderstruck eyeshadow on top so we get
a nice glowy blend blues now we're gonna
move under the eyes now I'm just taking
that same morphe blender and I didn't
dip into the eyeshadow again this is
left over so there is minimal fallout
and I'm just going to start blending the
blue into this white bold at the shadow
I try to do as minimal as I can so there
is not a lot of shadow falling all over
me now before I do anything else I'm
going to add some white liner into my
waterline whenever I do bright colors I
love to add white because it really
makes it pop you look very artificial if
we will and very dull light this is max
white fascinating liner I'm just going
to pull my skin down ever so gently and
I am going to pack this in now I love
white liner I've been using it since
the 90s it is just my go-to it opened
the eye brightens very different it's a
cool effect and you see me go back and
forth a lot not because the product
isn't good but I like to really pack it
in there so it is on all day now to
finish off the eyes I'm going to do some
really dramatic lashes from one of my
favorite brands flutter this style is
called intoxicating and they are big
I love these lashes really transform
your entire look I think now I'm gonna
coat my bottom and top lashes with
mascara and my favorite is the better
than sex by Too Faced
I love the bristles they are perfect for
my eyes now this application does not
have to be perfect since we are going to
cover them I just don't like when people
put on lashes without any mascara and
you can see they're real human hair
showing through or it's just not the
same color our lashes will never be this
black is why there is mascara
so let's cook these thoroughly alright
now when I do lashes I like to take the
strip off and of course I like to
measure them to my eye so not everyone
has crazy big lids to fit these lashes
so I've already pre trimmed mine a
little bit with a little bit of nail
scissors now since latex smells like a
dirty vagina I like to use non latex
glue from duo so this is the vegan
version so we're going to make that
tacky for a second now sometimes I like
to start in the middle and let go so I
can I'm gonna get up close and personal
for a second
these are Wow see the difference of an
eyelash alright lashes are done right
before a highlight I'm gonna do a little
fix plus refreshing make sure my
foundation is there now I've been
developing my own highlighters they are
coming out spring of 2016 so I have a
new one now the pan is going to be a lot
bigger than this but this is one of the
shades it is called deep freeze and it
is a baby blue my highlighters are very
pigmented so it remember to not pack it
on too crazy if it is a wild color so
I'm just going to lightly dust in the
pan
and I'm going to be working it into the
skin no how come no one's done a blue
highlighter before I don't know
but it was about time my clean of some
option to your people I'm getting bored
alright now I'm going to take a little
bit of a highlighter with my Mac to 5/2
and I'm just going to lightly do a
little bit lightly meaning intense in my
world things now I'm going to add a
little bit of highlighter right on my
Cupid's bow and bring it down on my lip
a tiny bit so when I put on my lipstick
it really pops
now I love to cry glitter so I'm going
to use lit cosmetics in Tinseltown for
that effect now you don't need any any
glitter adhere anything I just use my
tip that's it and I take it right under
my eye where I would cry and I dab a
little bit and then I just drag it down
over the highlight alright now we're
going to do lipstick and we are done
since my eyes and cheeks are so dramatic
I'm going to tone down the lip with
using my own velour liquid lipstick in
shade celebrity skin this is a good
everyday color I'm just going to write
straight on
voila we are done all right guys that is
the completed look I hope you enjoyed it

thoughts on my highlighters what colors
you want me to make and also what kind
of looks you want me to do next I know I
