channel now we're about to start this
 week off with a bang
because I have in front of me a bunch of
highlighters that I discovered on
Instagram
so basically y'all Instagram made me buy
it and I'm going to be talking about
three specific brands today one is
really indie and a few are still kind of
not as well known in America as it
should be so we're about to change that
today now all of these I have
accumulated over the last few weeks so
cool thing about that I haven't tried
anything so I already have an opinion
about anything this is basically like a
first impressions we're going to try out
three different highlighters so we're
going to dive into each highlighter
we're going to basically try them out on
my face and my body see if they work
space they're awful because who the
knows what the hell is going on anymore
but basically I discovered all these
brands on Instagram which is so cool
because Instagram has the dopest
I'm always scrolling and finding things
and I'm always tagged in a million
pictures so it's really cool to discover
makeup that I've never heard of before
which is awesome because that's okay
Anna it's all about y'all so I think
without further ado we're going to jump
into our very first one which I'm so
excited to try this I have seen so many
other youtubers and Instagram reviews
this this is from a brand called iconic
London now I don't really know much
about them obviously I'm Anna sumer from
UK so shout out to all my UK subscribers
out there ma hey girl alright guys so
basically this is a brand called iconic
London and they have something called
the illuminator you see this already in
the light if this does not look like
this on my cheekbones I'm getting on a
 flight and we gonna have some
problems girl but for real you guys this
is so stunning like in its component is
blinding now I haven't touched it I
haven't pulled it out you can see it's
very full to the brim so I haven't even
tried this yet and I
dying to film with it so I know a lot of
people have said that these are a dupe
for the cover FX drops I heard that they
might be even more pigmented which I
didn't know that could happen but I
guess we're about to find out right now
a little bit about this product let me
pull up my trusty phone y'all know me
basically this is drops like nothing
you've ever seen before
this concentrated shimmer drops allows
you to customize any product in your
makeup bag so you can add this to your
foundation you can add it to your primer
you can add up your moisturizer or use
them on their own for a super
highlighted golden glow now they
literally only have one shade which is
this one right in my hand so this is the
only shade that they carry currently in
their line which is a little weird on my
one shade girl hook it up now when I
usually use like dropper things like
this I like to apply them with my Beauty
Blender of course you can use a brush it
doesn't really say anything on the site
like what to apply it with I guess we're
just gonna maybe do mmm
we'll try both let's give her an opening
and see what this looks like oh my lord
girl look at bubbling like I'm
Nate's in my mouth okay anyway oh my
god it's I'm just dancing I'm going to
put on my cheeks first in my hand let's
just go to the cheeks and just
keep it really real why are we gonna
even play with the hand alright so I
don't know how much to use though like
what it could be like really pigmented
or maybe not I guess we're about to find
out all right so let's just drop this on
my cheeks oh I'm gonna start with
three which is the holy that looks
really pigmented and I'm just going to
take this Beauty Blender which is still
a little damp
so I guess let's go in and go ahead oh
oh oh this looks like liquid metal was
just dumped on my cheek and I'm kind of
living for look at that was so light I'm
like I wish it was daylight you guys I
would go outside her now and lay in the
grass and scream oh wow and you know
what's crazy is you guys I would assume
maybe I don't know why but I would
assume it would be a little sticky
after it doesn't feel like anything it
like are you kind of like set itself and
you ride and you know what I like about
this is that it doesn't really move my
makeup I do have contour on and I have
blush and it's not like really moving it
around some products it would kind of
like you know remove your foundation
make it spotty then I'm talking ah but
this really looks wet and glowy at the
same damn time I can't stop moving my
head sorry on microphone you guys
 me the chiropractor after this
but for real hmm
I'm shook so on the website all the
prices were in pounds so I converted
that into American currency and this is
basically about 27 US dollars so not bad
you do obviously get a lot of products
so you basically get 13 point 5
milliliters which is 0.45 fluid ounces
so that's a good deal now it is really
blinding I just want to put some on my
tattoo to see what it looks like because
I'm dying to know and let's just kind of
put that there not too much oh my god
holy let me close this up I'm
scared of spilling all right now let's
do what happens oh my god
and it's like the more we blend it just
still looks blinding it's not getting
shear or shitty which happens with a lot
of eyeliners it looks like my voice is
stopped working I'm so shocked about it
all right now quickly before we move on
to another brand iconic London also has
these strobing and glow sticks okay now
it may look like something like this and
these retails for about 21 dollars in
America now I want to dimension these
because I felt like obviously the
dropper is I didn't know what to expect
they just slave my life and
these are more like a bomb it reminds me
of the Pat McGrath skin fetish where you
basically this is called glow and then
this one is called shine so basically
this is a bomb cream stick let's just
really go in
my hand oh wow that is really blinding
for a bomb actually I'm like holy
now the cool thing about these is that
you can take these and you can bust them
out so they shear down and they still
keep their luminosity you can see a
little bit on the end of there and you
can bust them the only problem with the
bombs
now obviously the drops set themselves
now I don't know about this formula yet
it obviously just opened it but a lot of
the times we'll just give it a second is
that the creams stay creamy so it
doesn't really set on your skin and it
just kind of can move around your
foundation so a lot of the times I've
seen people including myself where they
put this down and then it's powder
highlighter on top and it's like extra
crazy which you don't know I'm into that
now I'm just going to swatch the other
one for fun Shh this one is called below
so I just felt like I had to mention
that and try these out obviously I'm not
going to put on my face yet I need to
save this side of my cheeks for another
highlighter but I definitely will be
implementing these maybe in a tutorial
soon you guys let me know if you want to
see all right let's move on to the next
highlighter all right the next brand
that we're going to talk about is
actually from London as well and this is
a brand called makeup revolution now I
use them in a tutorial a few weeks back
use their vivid baked highlighters which
actually works amazing and if we all can
do a quick recap the vivid highlighters
which I've already used pilots like a
mini vagina which is well known has come
the size of a real one speedos are
blinding unreal couldn't handle it great
but then I just saw recently on
Instagram that they released a new
product called the strobe highlighter
now of course we all know last year
people were trying to say strobing was
highlighting without doing contouring
you're just highlighting but anyway let
the world think whatever they want to
think so strobing is here and basically
this product which is only six dollars
so this is a really cool affordable kind
of a drugstore brand now they do sell
makeup revolution in Ulta which is
worried about mine now I'm looking on
the website and this says that this
light powder highlighter using
natural illumination to the skin by
diffusing the light don't want to not
diffuse I don't know okay can be applied
both wet or dry for different
intensities and is very buildable I love
a brand that is really honest because a
lot of the times which we skin on my
channel I'll review something the
packaging says this and then this
happens and you're like what the actual
 so I guess we can use this wet or
dry and see what the hell happens I
bought three shades I bought this one
which is called holographic light and
then I also got one called ever glow
light okay this one looks like a more
basically like I'm not trying to be
Kunti they look a little chalky without
me even trying them they don't look
blinding at all but hey it's said a
natural illumination so hey we're going
to give them that I don't think it
supposed to look like this but you never
know and then the third shade is called
moon glow lights which looks like this
this one looks to be the most glorious
so I'm just going to pick this one up
this is holographic light let's do a
quick fingers watch oh okay alright now
when you look at my finger it almost
looks like a little yellow greenish
reptilian huge which I like so let's
just wash this in the middle of my palm
and see what happens
oh wow I'm a little shook by that look
at that hmm whoa it does have this
beautiful like greenish yellow undertone
and it's really pretty now mister this
watches other one because this one looks
like a little literal chalk not even
going to be shady about it but okay this
has like no shine if you're going to
compare them
this one is bling bling and this one is
I don't know what at the end okay it is
but alright so let's just watch this
here I know my palm of my hand is a
little annoying for some people you guys
know the tattoos are everywhere it oh
yeah this one this one is called ever
globe ice this must be what they're
talking about with that natural finish
because girl and we don't all want that
blinding metallic effect obviously the
average woman is not going to the office
with metallic cheekbones which I wished
we're but hey all right now obviously
this does have a blinding effect we saw
it on my hand right about here but I
just want to try a natural one I know
that's going to shock everyone in your
public where the is my judge we go
listen let's just try it and give it a
whirl so I will use a let's use a little
more fee this is the of course the five
ten one of my favorite highlighting
Packer brushes of all let's dust her off
all right and then let's just swirl this
around all right so I really throw this
on I got a lot on the brush girl this is
a little more powdery than the other
previous one but um two happens I get it
there's a lot of people out there that
would love this because it is very
subtle it is a very let's just say it
uncle Oh from within so this is not for
me so this obviously isn't like a flop
because it's doing what it said is
giving you a natural illumination it's
just so subtle I'm like kind of bored of
it so the strobe highlighter for makeup
revolution not my favorite formula or
finish the vivid baked highlighter
though this one is the one to get you
are going to try this brand but if you
are someone that just wants to be really
natural this would actually be good for
you I'm just not killing it I'm over
here like uh-huh yes bitch I look like a
 stained glass window on my face
over here I'm kind of like okay I don't
know how to rough day my husband cheated
on me and I'm just trying to get this
today not for me okay you don't get
sarcasm please don't watch my channel oh
my gosh we just ruin this cheekbone so
I'm going to dust this off I gotta say
this makeup revolution
I love the brand obviously this product
is just not for me
but they also have blinding highlighters
so you do get to pick or choose let's
move on into the third and final brand
the cheek bone over here is looking a
little lonely compared to this one so
hopefully we're about to fix that
problem and now I have seen these all
over Instagram all over the explore page
and this is from a brand called Sorrows
are cosmetic
now this is another brand from UK this
retails for $18 in America they do ship
from UK now this one I'm kind of living
for I can't wait to try it this one is
called diva you guys know we have a dog
named Eva my license plate on one of my
card it says mr. diva and basically this
is right up my alley so this says that
this is a 24 karat gold loose powder
that is super finely milled to give you
that extra golden Sparkle it can be worn
anywhere on the skin to highlight and
illuminate the feature that you want to
show off diva is a shade suitable for
all skin tones
especially for fair skin let's roll now
the vegan is cruelty free there also is
three grams of product says jar sizes 20
grams with 3 grams of product there's a
lot of amazing reviews on this I've seen
so many people that tagged me and me
like Geoffrey please try these on tell
me if they're real oh they're good if
they're whatever the they are so
obviously we're going to try them right
now
now I have a bunch of shades here I have
about 5 shades the ones that I think
with to me are of course
diva and then another one called gold
rush which looks like this I've seen
this one all over the IG videos so I
don't supposed to use wet or dry I'm
assuming dry first so I'm just going to
take this and that's what I like to do
because it does have a sister I'm just
going to pour some on the cap so we have
a bunch of product right there and I
guess everyone else uses a fan brush so
let's use a fan brush as well this is
the morphe 310 that I've been using
before ever and oh it is on that
brush so I am going to unscrew Venus
everywhere let's just try it on Hannibal
Lector and see what happens so I'm going
to hold up my arm y'all this is
obviously very dry and let's see what
happens oh oh wow okay
now I am in a room full of beauty lights
so what I like to do sometimes I like to
turn on the flash on my phone you guys
already know what the drill is click
this BAM we have the flashlight on now
let's look at my arm oh wow you see all
that shimmer imagine being in the
daylight when the Sun hits your cheeks
and it's like good morning girl yes oh
wow I think because this one is more
like the golden tone I'm going to go in
with the diva one and I could use a
packer brush I think I'm gonna try it
with this first so let's go back in
there's still some products on here I'm
just going to lightly go on there
because I don't know how this is going
to look on my face versus my arm and
let's see what happens
oh wow
holy tell me why this looks more
blinding on my cheek than it did on my
arm I am like oh I'm gonna blend that
right into my brows right in my
hairline girl don't play me hmm oh my
god you guys we just have a moment of
silence hmm oh wow almost like looks wet
like this was definitely looks wet look
at that below those we take a
moment hmm and then this is like this is
like much Halleck Terminator
obsessed can't handle it this one is I'm
obsessed or eight different like in the
sense where has a lot of sparkle a lot
of glitter I really I'm like I'm not
over I'm wrong really I'm like hi lyric
we live more okay now let me take a tiny
bit is going this oh I did not expect
this to be this crazy like when I did it
on my arm I was like okay this is cute
it's spreading out it's a very shimmery
I would actually wear this during the
summertime like all over my body and
just really take it there satellite NASA
yes God but on the cheekbones this is so
beautiful I know like saying the same
thing over and over but I'm not over it
Wow alright guys I think it's time to do
a roundup of all three and give my
thoughts alright guys so that concludes
my trying out Instagram highlighters or
stuff I found on the internet this is a
lot of fun thank you guys so much for

side of my face

my foundation I want to drip this down
my body I want to put it on my dessert
later when I plugins have a meal I'm
obsessed with it so kudos to this brand
obsessed with it I know I did mention
knees I haven't really used them on my
face yet so I really don't want to save
her approved or not I will have to try
these later on but I didn't want to show
them to you guys
alright now the makeup revolution strobe
highlighters wasn't obsessed with it I
personally do not like the natural
finish they were a little too chalky and
powdery for me but listen for six
dollars you kind of get what you pay for
for this type of product so I am not
going to approve this they are not
Jeffrey's are approved and I don't want
to give it a big fail or an epic like it
it just wasn't for me and I wasn't
really obsessed with the formula and
when I brush that away
it came off way too easy so sorry not
this one alright and now moving on to
