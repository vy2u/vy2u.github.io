channel alright so today we have James
Charles here and he is going to
transform me like you guys have never
seen before so what do you have what do
you have in store for me well I feel
like I have seen you do so many things
from a blog to pink to green but the one
type of claim that I have never seen you
in again it's like a full-on like a
bronze dark moment Oh what I'm either
known for either super bright creative
makeup yeah that okay so I really want
to give you take me that okay I am so
down for that so we're gonna do a wig
later and we're gonna do you're just
gonna glam me I'm gonna give him full
reigns and control no I can't wait for
this because I have been dying for you
to do my brows yes we did have a sister
sleepover last night we did living on
filming for videos today and something
happened I woke up with this discuss the
Messiah let's just get this die in the
room alright so if you don't know what a
sty is it happens when you what I mean
how did how did you get it I filmed the
video where I just got ready in Sephora
using all tests her makeup in under 30
minutes I was talking about sanitization
before the video even started and it got
down to the last like few minutes and I
used a mascara tube right from Sephora
but you used a tester no no you just
went right and does not even think about
it as soon as the ended I was like oh a
little swollen okay not really see much
out of it but you know what we're gonna
be doing the tutorial from this way yes
so you can still see out of those eyes
oh thank god so okay perfect
yeah we're gonna keep it in style and
we're gonna keep it moving if you have
any stage oh please help alright you
guys so if you want to see us dive into
this amazing transformation to keep on
watching so how are we gonna more so we
already moisturize our skin already
moisturized with some sister Tasha water
cream the best we're gonna go with the
touch us so campus start us off this is
not sponsored they have great products
it really should be though ahead of
something that's really into your bra so
you make sure all the hair follicles are
filled yeah alright so what are we gonna
use for foundation today we're gonna use
the lemare soft fluid long wear
foundation broad-spectrum SPF 20 that's
right you've never used this on no never
taught it before yeah now usually in
mixed to shades but James wants to meet
to be a little more bronze like he is so
we're gonna go in
I want to give him a little bit of a
more like bronzy type of glam okay I
just want to do a light coverage over
majority the neck and grab Monstar as
well just so the foundation really does
match because last thing we want as a
flash a very situation where nice does
not match the body because you know how
that goes
okay so I'm gonna try the makeup
revolution conceal and define on Jeffrey
as well I've also never tried this one
this is like a first impressions for
James yeah I've not really a makeup
review channel I really don't like doing
them at all I tend to stick with a lot
of the same exact products and almost
every single makeup video oh right my
nostril I love if you wanted me to smell
it I'm so down for that how bad is it
look no no oh she's trying to conceal
those nose hairs I didn't know I had
serious bear sorry doll so I'm really
focusing the concealer on at the high
points of Geoffrey's face being right
underneath the ice and I'm not gonna
bring it all the way out either because
like me we both have very long faces so
I lower man yeah we do that long because
the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse to
yet into us all the time definitely have
a horse face thank you for letting me
know world damn girl I definitely like
to what kind of widen up my face yeah by
bringing the concealer focus more in the
center as opposed to like really winging
out there because they feel like
sometimes that along gates everything we
didn't use blend with the blender right
you don't have any oil sprays you know
everyone saying you know that's sounds
like a lot mm-hmm
an esse Cerie we're also gonna use the
k'kaw concealer in the shade number one
and the high points of sister stars face
to really brighten everything up you
better set this face where he needs the
sister projects or powder yes my
favorite pop this under the eyes oh it's
looking sick I'm gonna wipe off the
excess powder okay and then we're going
to put on some more powder I love that
how do me uh well actually before we do
that I want to give you a good spread of
fix+ okay I'm really into using like a
lot of different layers for my makeup
routine but I believe especially when
you're using a lot of powder it's really
important to hydrate the skin it is
really dry it can be really bad really
fast oh and no one's into looking like
an alligator No
so I'm gonna grab my morphe m55 four
brush and dip into the lightest shade of
the honest Asya
powder contour kit and uses to once
again further those highlights in all
the center places Center hello Jeffrey
space oh my god you would die if you
ever watched one of my videos unedited I
say the same thing like 87 really well I
speak so far yes okay until I met James
I never knew that you could watch
YouTube sped up but you could watch the
videos how did I know I never knew no
one ever told me well I speaks of us and
thinks so fast I need to speak of some
people one of those ones I lost you and
at least like 1.5 times yeah I'm like
sister Jeffrey's love you but I cannot
watch yeah I love it but I had no idea
you could speed up video so now James
has changed my world and we're thinking
I can watch videos quicker
some people talk so slow or it's too
much including myself
you can also slow it down huh oh yeah
you can I'm gonna use the middle and
right hand shades right here with my
morphe Emma five to seven brush and
really a bronze out assists her stars of
fate I need to stop saying sister's
house jokes getting old no Tommy's
sister all day long okay
also in case you've been living under a
bridge if you love Morphy what you guys
know my brand is carried in it but if
you want any more food products use
coach James Rosen are you sure can you
can actually use his code I don't have a
code my brand is sold in all of their
stores and website but you can't get
discount on J on JSC sorry I feel when
it comes to contour and bronze looks the
most important thing is like a very
bright Center which we definitely have a
on right now and then a very like dark
outside yeah and hopefully what the
lighting doesn't look too intense
because it's looking a little spooked
right now and it will all come together
yeah so we're gonna contour Jeffrey's
nose using the JD weighty at 180 Luxy
182 brush that's the mouth yeah they
need a better name for that right now
this is like the best first ever nose
contouring I literally if this is not my
makeup bag I would cry yes I could not
do it so just gonna use the same exact
contour powders okay I'm gonna go in
lightly and chisel out the sides of
Jeffrey's nose now nose contouring is
definitely like my holy girl like it so
I hear apart my makeup routine I
definitely have a big nose and a
rhinoplasty is not surgery that I had
want fine every day one and probably no
I'm sure I really like my nose like for
bolt like yeah
yeah I think it's super cute but like
when it comes to glam super incoming
yeah okay the most in committee ever so
that's why we have sister facetune yes
we did the ring but I really really love
a good nose contour to you an illusion
of a rhinoplasty with makeup which I
love everyone did you like officially
start playing with makeup for the first
time oh my god eleven and a half turning
12 so before I was literally born yes
[Laughter]
that's pretty cool yeah I don't know why
I was really gravitated towards it and I
just started stealing my mom's makeup
and wearing it to school like putting
all of my fingers red rusty burgundy
eyeshadow like I was just feeling it I
love the way it made your eyes look and
like transform yeah it was just like an
addiction so it's a fun process yeah my
parents were definitely like not as
accepting at first okay there were a lot
of fights in the house a lot of times
police were called a lot of like
different my situation it was really I
only talk about that a few times like
briefly but um like once they really
understood like this is just once it's
like a little fad yeah real once they
really got it that it was like 10 but I
was seriously interested in that I was
gonna treat it as a business and they
were like down okay we're just really
really really dough I'm gonna use the
Mac peaches blush on Trevor this is my
all-time favorite is it okay so did the
only blush I wear I haven't use that in
a while and what brush you are using so
little Gucci black dress yes she brushes
no I'm like a surprisingly pretty frugal
with my money which I like a lot of like
influencers don't talk about that much
like I don't at all well no don't spend
it unless you have it yeah that's my
motto and a lot of people overspend or
trying to follow trends or trying to I
don't know fit in there trying to keep
up with what others are doing it's like
girl I just do you yeah so unless you
can pay for it don't charge it up that's
my motto
alright the moment we've all been
waiting for I've been dying for sister
James do some brows on me so I'm scared
thick hair though well no but this could
either go really good or really bad Dan
I feel I feel like brows like the window
to your soul and we are I definitely had
it quite the brow transformation yes who
for the better
uh-huh what sort of my makeup career to
now so I'm definitely gonna try to give
you like my snatch brows now okay but
I'm gonna try to draw them do the
original James Charles no I don't think
you are
I don't think I'd anybody wants that
ever okay let's do we're gonna do so
you're using anastacio this is in medium
brown okay dark which may look a little
weird in my ears blonde but I remember
the wigs coming I can do the shape of
how high up do you usually put that oh
okay that's a good question
so I usually start like oh my god like
really where you had them I can't make
that up okay that's so crazy
that's literally where I put it like
right there yeah that's a lot yeah and
then I know you like to pull your brows
usually down but really I've been liking
to pull my brow tails out oh do it
please I love that mm-hmm okay so
recently I've been dying asking this cuz
and he just got back from Coachella I
was in Alaska pretending Coachella
didn't happen James was running
Coachella so it was a good mix yeah
and I live for your outfits but the
internet it was a lot it was a it blew
up there was a lot of love but there was
so many people coming out of the
woodwork just being evil rude nasty yeah
and I feel like people get away with
just being ugly nasty it's just crazy so
I don't know how how do you personally
feel about it I have never felt more
beautiful and more confident and like my
entire life I went to the designer Brian
Hearns who did all three of my love him
he's he's dressed megastars
so to have him make clothes for you and
dress he was iconic a huge honor yes and
we he put those together so quickly and
after like the backlash that we got from
Coachella he was so excited he's like we
need to do all your clothes yeah work
girl like let's do that it's crazy
everyone you know if no one wants
negativity no body shaming no
talking but as soon as you're just
living your life and being you well what
people will say things that they would
if you've ever talked like that which
we're not we don't do that thinking
about it nice that I generally don't
think I've ever left a hate comment and
I definitely been shady and like I but I
always right my wrongs yeah it's funny
but but I've never wanted to straight
out of someone's page am like you're
ugly you look fat this outfit look
stupid I maybe we've all thought it
let's be real and if so why would you
act out and hurt someone's feelings no
things y'all and it's like and what I
was thinking too and so many people were
bringing up if any girl had worn any the
three outfits that I was talking about
it would have been all love cuz like
while your ass looks so fake like well
love that like so good and they slander
love sexualizing women
it's a dude and you're wearing makeup
together I just felt like it was just a
free-for-all I was a lot I'm trying to
sketch and some light hairs into
Jeffrey's brow I might you definitely
like I'm more like painted on I love
hair but I live for a good like feather
we brought clearly I have a whole lot of
brow yeah to work with so I definitely
want to give you like as close to what
my brows look like as possible okay I
love that
okay so I have my morphe m-43 two
brushes just a flat top concealer brush
and I dipped into more of that makeup
revolution at concealer / Jeffrey's
request hey I'm gonna statue right
underneath that brow so you do concealer
all the way down or how do you do it is
considered as an eyelid base base right
it's good once again type of person yeah
don't hang for a murder I know face but
like this keep it moving you know okay
so to go along with this very dark smoky
clam I really want to give Jeffrey a
more soft glam type of yes off my own so
I really wanna go in for like to be kind
of like oranjee but also get more a cool
tone some videos on a Southie pallet and
also the androgyny power hey I'm gonna
grab this and for for wonders of my
favorite like fluffy yeah right in the
crease yep every time and I'm gonna grab
orange soda bomb some lamb and burnt
orange actually might as well okay start
bag now this situation simply gonna be
interesting because you very a lot of
eyelid space yeah sorry my bone yeah
interrupts the whole situation
yeah I got this forehead bone love this
okay I'm not going to take the shade
rustic in soft glam with my m4 three
three and I'm gonna pop that right on
the outer crease laugh is one cool
except I'm like the more neutral bronze
head rather than like war me orange Tory
I feel like Geoffrey does do not a lot I
mean we all have to be real so I
definitely want to give him something
that he like doesn't wear very often Lee
Anne I've been loving a really good like
cool toned okay so I'm not gonna read
that same exact brush and dip into a
dominatrix from the androgyny palette
and packed it on the outer corner of lid
I'm gonna do any more like rounded type
of eye shapes today usually I like doing
kind of winged out eye shades on myself
but like we said we definitely wanna
keep the focus right on the center of
the face to really make it more like
rounded and shortened so I really like
doing this I
I want to Wang out this shadow just a
little bit slightly upwards towards the
brow bone this is gonna be a little bit
challenging because the Jefferies brow
bone is in the way but you know what you
know what we don't have any bone
grafting available right now so we're
just gonna maybe in next video you be on
one say when we really fell nice when I
don't have a side all right Stila little
magnificent medals yep so this is a
shade of smokey star when I want to put
this on at Jeffrey's lead and kind of
cut the crease and I'm not gonna cut it
well I guess I'm gonna cut it but I'm
gonna try to not be as a karst I
normally would for a regular cut crease
because Geoffrey's crease it moves
around a lot when his brow bone is in
the way and I don't want it to transfer
all around if that means yes and then
before it fully dries down I want to
quickly take the same brush from before
you guys can see I am really into Sakai
I'm gonna dip into the shade rustic
which has got like a transition middle
transition shape we used before and I'm
going to blend together that dominatrix
shade and the smoky storm just because I
really can not fan when there's a blunt
line looks so ugly so I'm gonna grab it
once again that same exact brush yeah I
could literally do an entire eye shadow
lock with just the m4 33 like this is or
literally any brush of a similar shape
to this below that video like that yeah
it's covered it's not my last there we
go I knew it had to be coming so he does
it first yes
okay speaking of eye I've seen a lot of
some moments where you've done something
that was literally out of your brain and
someone trying to tell you that like oh
that's been done before copied and I'm
like oh I'm so sick of the copying game
and like people wanting credit when they
didn't do anything and it just it's
getting kind of out of hand that happen
YouTube I think a lot in the YouTube
world girl and at the end of the day
like the makeup world has been around
for so long and so much has already been
done before yeah it's like how many
times can you teach us how to do a brown
smokey eye yes I agree that's why I was
trying to push myself to be as creative
as possible and really put out content
that I'm really proud of the man isn't
the most tutorial based or review based
or makeup related but it's not that
makes me happy at the end of the day
I've been able to build an amazing
subscriber base that enjoy that type of
content do what I think
because people are getting so bored of
everything else thank God how many top
Orioles crazy on a smoky eye right like
but I love that um it's all about just
pushing yourself and ideas and sometimes
I'll think of something in the mic is
that too much or too weird and I'm like
no let's just do it now let's do it yeah
we're an interesting time period right
now where if you take inspiration from
somebody I believe credit should always
begin of course especially because there
are so many people ripping off people
and people stealing things but at the
same time nothing is that original
anymore right and it's ridiculous to try
to create it's like oh it's a very I'm
gonna give me and you props for creating
a lot of content that hasn't been done
before
no-one's done like on Hollywood
Boulevard no-one's done makeup in a test
like yeah so it's cool that were like
that's what we specialize in like
tutorials are fun and all good but I
just think that so many people are doing
that and there's people that literally
only do tutorials great good for that
yeah and just like you're not really
under reviewing stuff that the people
that I watched might help with makeup
tips and techniques but at the same time
that's when you're doing it every single
day you know it's like we know most
about it and that's not even being like
a crime yeah we're the best artists that
I just like when you're playing with
makeup all day long every day you start
to figure it out yeah pretty easily you
do trial and error yeah tutorials to us
not not that they feel below me because
I still do them but it's like I don't
necessarily think it is yeah I don't
have any time with any more yeah yeah
yes we are gonna be filming on sister
James's channel yep we're gonna be doing
a style swap which is gonna be it so
I've never done something like that
before so it's gonna be epic and of
course if you're already watching this
it will be linked down below yeah so hop
on over when this is done
all right waterline what are we going
what's going in there okay so I'm gonna
put a nude pencil in the waterline this
is the mac and w25 /nc 30 studio chroma
graphic pencil crane ball 10 you suggest
pencils i think it's for like lip liner
and i don't even know what if your ghost
I don't know I really love a nude in the
water when it comes to what smokey looks
like this what I do my makeup every day
my goal is literally how can I make
myself look as doll-like as possible
especially when it comes to my
foundation my contour my fake freckle is
my lashes and then of course my face
tuned at the end as well so I always
like to do a nude in the water like it
makes the eyes look more rounded which
gives like that doll like type of look
oh you wanna do this yourself baby I'm
down well we just mix two pencils cuz my
nude eyeliner broke and this one's a
little yellow so we just kind of mix
these two this is fascinating white from
Mac I always use this one yeah it's
really pretty
okay BAM I kind of love it my favorite
for like drag looks early colorful looks
so quickly before we move on to the next
I I like to obviously highlight so we
can bring emphasis to the eyes and I'm
gonna use the different highlighter on
Jeffrey's face but I just recently
discovered this which is the time or
hella taught that it's the time the
Tarte chrome paint shadow Palmer shade a
top yacht oh yeah that's a lot so a lot
of teeth it's a lot of teeth but this
shading in battle yeah it is so pretty
and it's literally the most blinding
inner corner highly ever okay
I feel like highlighters no matter how
good a highlighter is never looks bright
enough on the inner corner right just
because it's like a shadow in there
don't know really this is like
next-level you're saying next level okay
live it at all
okay should I give up she needs some
intensity gonna give it a little sister
sledding okay and the sister slope oh-ho
with the sister skis yeah Wow right okay
it's also just gonna grab a mac 242
brush
yeah colonic shot a bunch everyone uses
I don't got that same exact
pigpig man thank you now she's staying
in place she's sister staying she sister
staying and we're gonna pop that right
on the center of the brow bone Wow
it's not a wig oh wow I really love this
one I'm feeling very James right now
alright you guys I just put on some
mascara a little benefit roller lash and
now we're about to do some what we've
picked on Miami's yeah we picked up some
Lily lashes in the style Miami Yuko
James for money haul okay James I was
about to say do we have a code for Lily
her lashes are a little pricey but
they're they're amazing and you can
reuse them if you clean them as well
that's a lot of use Mary's like ten
times yeah so I'm gonna use these in my
all-time favorites I'm actually gonna
trim them a la I know you don't usually
trim your lashes a little bit one of my
biggest pet peeves is when you put on a
pair of lashes they're safe for people
like me who have more down turn eyes and
you're gonna do as well yeah Jess I hate
it when you don't trim your lashes and
then the outer lash or like coming down
oh or the band is weird and it's like it
gets me good so I always actually like
to trim off a lot of my lashes and
leisurely focus it on the kind of middle
of the eye to really give it a lifted
and once again the dalek type of Lois so
I really want to give that to Jeffrey
today I'm just gonna plaid let's using
the duo eyelash glue this is the only
logical I will ever use oh he's the same
one good vegan okay so I'm gonna pop
this right on the center once again of
Jeffrey's lid so like I was saying - I
do always trim the lashes so give that
outer edge a left and when you do this
the lash actually doesn't always go all
the way across the lash band but for
people like me and Jeffrey who both have
a pretty decent natural lashes it allows
them to blend together so it doesn't
look as weird and then this just gives
so much more of a lifted pretty look and
you don't get that weird a sagging
situation that looks the worse on
literally everybody all right lashes on
I'm living already alright so this is
what I all complete thank God we're
gonna do the other one off-camera doubt
which will be so much easier because I
have my right hand so thank the Lord
Jesus in heaven above it'll be right
back to finish off with the rest of the
face BAM really good really fresh
feeling fresh so 400 said reviews the
Augusta's yes it's all Hollywood if
you're a true sister you know that I've
been using this and I wanna make her
precision day one and I have a literally
never switched I've tried many other
highlighters and yes a few days ago I
just tried to sort Coppedge from the
24-karat palette a little bit too
intense they wanted a soft highlighting
look I did not get that I did not get
that girl loved it the most but
definitely want to go for a softer look
Hollywood yeah okay so I'm gonna also
spread Jeffrey's face first - I always
like to give a light layer fix+ before
putting on a highlighter just because I
really wanna make sure that it hath lain
to stick to I'm so therapeutic
turn to the side Paco there she is
Gold yes oh wow can I sure to blend it
white and obviously but I just like to
have it or some watch it so pretty I'm
also gonna grab what's remaining on that
brush and put it right in the center of
Geoffrey's forehead as well okay I
really love highlighting up here because
when the light catches it it hits it
really nicely and then I'm actually
gonna go in with a smaller highlighting
brush this is the morphe I'm a 504 it's
just a smaller version of like the m5 on
what everyone uses yeah and actually dip
into a little bit of it brush off the
excess and I always like to pop a little
bit of highlighter right here right
above the brow bone and it really brings
attention to that especially from the
side profile and it helps to widen out
the face a little bit too way and then
once again grabbing that Tarte Paint Pot
in top yacht and I'm gonna place that
with this smaller highlighting brush
give it a light wow spreads okay and
then it's gonna go on right on the
highpoint turn this way oh yeah there
she is girl Wow mm-hmm so there good
morning how are you or neighbor okay and
our last step of highlighting the best
part is gonna be the sister nose
highlight as the iconic sister highlight
yeah how I think of a matching s or
didn't figure it out sister sparkle yeah
it's a sister shimmer a sister schnoz
shimmer there better be a video of how
many times we say sister put all into
one you're welcome for the contact yes
we need James and Jeffries saying sister
for a two minute straight thank you
alright so gonna use the pencil brushes
the m43 one I always like to make sure
I'm using a pencil brush or a very tiny
brush for nose highlighting here like I
was talking right that's for my nose
right like I was talking about before
when you're kind of doing that link
concealer on the side of the nose and
the baking on the side of the nose and
the two tight lines that kind of creates
that further illusion of a nose
highlight so investing pains me more
than watching somebody try to its snatch
a nose and then using a big-ass
highlighting brush to highlight it kills
the whole illusion if you want to have
that snatch nose you have to only keep
the highlight in a very focus spot if
that makes sense so to really further
that illusion and make it seem like the
bridge is super super tightening all
right the nose is now just look at that
house she's looking good
so our laugh is gonna be less before
that one last
of fix+ you guys know I live for this
so now we have Lhasa finally left and
they only be appropriate for mr. Jeffrey
Stern yeah what shade are you feeling I
think I want to definitely do a like
nude it's just because my eyes are
pretty dark and smoky okay um definitely
high noon
oh I mean that's classic you can do this
but then let's put a little bit of the
oh I'm nude in the center yeah perfect
oh I'm scared okay I don't know I do
list of other people so challenging
because it looks is such like a personal
talk yes I'm gonna have Jeffrey actually
over line at the top of his left because
it doing flips and other people is very
very challenging and it's funny to you
because I tweeted about this a few days
ago I know you can't reply to me it's so
crazy how like our faces don't change
unless of course you get filler or stuff
like that but some days your makeup
comes up so good and some days I may not
feel like you're a horrible artist and
you look ugly oh you know I don't know
why I'm weird and I just want to pop it
a little bit of the I'm nude liquid
lipstick right in the center as well not
too much because they don't want any
like super super intense stark contrast
moment but just like a little bit to
give a little I was accused an eyeshadow
brush and I'm blending together liquid
lipsticks okay I do want to add a little
bit of a gloss as well okay what are we
feeling my favorite my favorite gloss of
all time with Too Faced melted like a
liquid give it a whirl and I know that
they're not your favorite but you know
what it's a good class but it's a good
gloss I've actually never dried that
they're really bomb and this is the
shade of peekaboo I love how they smell
the Provos really well we smell for me
gloss it's like a really hit or miss
type of item or sometimes they're the
best and sometimes they're like the
worst yeah and it's one of those things
words like if you are wearing a cloth
you have to commit to long you gotta
commit you gotta commit like you have to
be ready to reapply yet to be ready to
take it off before you get any like it's
a lot so what I figured you know what
like we're going big or going home today
we're gonna do a sister gloss but just a
lot okay BAM love there be some settings
break times the last sister settings
