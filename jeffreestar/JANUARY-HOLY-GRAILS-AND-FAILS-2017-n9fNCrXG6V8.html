welcome back to my channel and in for
new hi what's up if you've never seen me
before pauses video do a quick Google
search and either start jacking off or
run for the hills ho alright so anyway
we are about to dive into my January
favourites but we have a little bit of a
twist today now listen as 2017 is a
brand new year and I always get requests
to put in products that I also didn't
love in my videos and I've kind of
stayed away from that because I feel
like with me especially it's that fine
line of everyone always wants to make a
circus out of every opinion I have I
think because maybe I have my own brand
I'm not allowed to speak on certain
things and that's what some people like
to let me know but listen at the end of
the day I'm a makeup lover I buy so much
makeup each month and I try out so many
products I'm gonna start putting in
products that I don't love so I think
for the new year this is going to be the
January holy grails and failed so I
think we should just dive in and I'm
going to basically just tell you guys
all my favorite products that I've been
loving over the last month and then a
few that didn't really work for me but
um January was a crazy month for me you
guys all know that I was in Paris for
Men's Fashion Week so we filmed a little
travel blog now me and Nathan got really
sick on our trip so we kinda had to cut
it short but we filmed a lot of really
cool stuff and we also have filmed
Nathan getting a tattoo and we also just
did I mask which is a makeup convention
so we kind of combined it all and that
video will be coming later this week so
watch out for on my channel
now besides that you guys let's dive
right into it alright my first holy
grail is from the brand Stila now these
are the magnificent metals glitter and
glow liquid eyeshadows whoo I'm winded
bitch now I'm wearing this on my lid
today I wore it in a few videos already
in the get ready my rolls-royce
featuring Nikita I wear the gold one now
listen I have been wearing these every
single day there are a lot of colors so
besides these two which I know you guys
are all going to be like what is on your
lid the shade is called rose gold retro
it is so stunning and these are really
easy to play
because they are literally liquid
glitter in a bottle once watch my hand
right here oh are you kidding me they
dry really instantly there is full
coverage a lot of these glitter items
from other brands you kind of swipe it
and it's like chunky it's watery it's
not amazing somehow feel out perfected
this formula and the good news is there
are a lot of other colors so they have
like this crazy purple they have a black
with gold glitter inside of it and of
course they have a pure gold which I've
worn before
these are just really good for even if
you don't want to wear all this I make
if you can literally just throw some
glitter on the lid a little orange in
the crease and a lash and you're ready
to fucking slave baby so these are
definitely going to be worn down all
year and hopefully they release more
colors let's move on to some foundation
I know a lot of you're going to be a
little shook that I'm including an
amazing drugstore brand in my favorite
but yes the new wet and wild photo focus
foundation is so unreal now last month I
did a little battle of the foundations I
have put this up against a crazy luxury
brand and this one really stole the show
and I'm like listen for 595 if something
can be beautiful flawless and have a
great finish I think we have a winner so
when a wild I feel like I don't know if
they've been stepping it up but to me
they definitely have I know a lot of
people are like Geoffrey they've always
been great but I remember like back in
the day in high school I tried it and I
was like
no but fast forward to 2016 I use a lot
of wet and wild stuff they had some of
the balm and highlighters of last year
and they're affordable which i think is
amazing so a lot of you guys to is put
to the test if you missed it I will link
it down below but this foundation you
guys it blends beautiful it is just
amazing if you like a really nice matte
manikin finish defilade should try this
out this sicily double Atencio primer I
think I'm saying wrong T and se you are
y'all I think French okay so someone
help me out I always get red to filter
mispronouncing things but anyway I
reviewed this again a few months ago and
it was amazing
let me say that it first like right off
the bat it was amazing but then it kind
of sat on the shelf for a minute because
you know 50 other primers came out so I
revisited this all of last month
everywhere I traveled I brought this and
it is so sickening crisis a little highs
a little up there a lot of you were like
but if you can get a sample of this or
just invest in an amazing primer for
some reason when your skin is bare and
claim you put it on everywhere it almost
gets a little like tacky and it just
feels amazing and the foundation just
I'm wearing it today of course the
foundation just sits oh oh oh like so
beautifully I don't know if I've ever
experienced a primer like this it's also
supposed to have long-term skincare
benefits which is probably why the price
is a little up there because it's not
just a normal ass primer it does have
some amazing skincare benefits so this
one ain't going anywhere anytime soon
how many people and how many brands put
out contour books last year I think a
million I have tried everything from
morphe to Tarte to everything and I have
this lorac Pro contour book sitting on
my shelf and I really haven't given it
much love and I've been using it the
last few months and I'm really really
into it I really am now we're trimming
out is that even though I've been using
for two months like I'm just going to
take this morphe brush is really what I
use it for and I'll go in and for some
reason that
and it looks like I haven't really been
using it which I love so that means a
formula is really bomb so if you see me
barely pressing it like it is just I
don't know what it is but the powers are
like oh they're like velvet in my hands
I'm like oh but um they blend amazing
and they just get your face released
snatch now I think my only complaint
about this is that I wish that there
were more shades I feel like so many
contour palettes have like three shades
and my girl there are so many more skin
tones than that so luckily this one does
work for me if you want to try any
contour palette and you're not really
sure you know I would definitely give
this one a whirl I think lorac has been
around for a really long time I remember
in high school they had this hot pink
blush I will never forget it I wore it
every single day I think I bought like
five of them so it's cool to see this
brand going really strong and still
playing the game so the last thing I'm
going to talk about any makeup family is
this new G bond she is kind of like a
primer it's like a highlighter it is a
strobing pop-up jelly highlighter for
face and body now let me show you why I
loved it it's pink it's very pink now if
you want she has a beauty brand of
course we all know them for their
amazing fashion but their brand kind of
like Gucci and other high-end brands are
not really celebrated by makeup artists
on that they're not really used a lot so
I'm like okay girl let me just give this
brand a little world I'm going to
demonstrate this for you because this is
so pretty
alright now if you see this like I'm
going to shake it it it really is like a
jelly and if you touch it you see that
it's like not really moving it's really
weird like the consistency is almost
like I don't know it's like a flubber
type of like weird putty type of thing
alright so basically you take a little
bit of this right I'm just going to take
it like this and you put it on your face
so pretend is with my face or your body
and you just kind of rub it in and it
gives you this beautiful pink shimmer
like it's just really pretty let's let
that dry so I'm going to turn on my
iphone flash light because the beauty
lights kind of diffuse it but this
sounds like this really really fine
pretty glitter into it and
kind of living for it so if you really
don't want to wear makeup and you don't
want to work foundation that day I
definitely would advise on literally
just throwing us on some mascara lip
gloss by girl but it is really pretty
now it doesn't really say that it's a
primer but I use it for a primer the
other day just for shits and giggles and
it was really pretty and I also took in
Slavit all over my arms because I was
wearing a short sleeved outfit and I
kind of lived for it so if you have a
extra moment I would just suggest you
try this bitch out time to dive into my
favorite skincare of last month and
really excited about this one because
one of my favorite skincare brands ever
glam glow finally release their Sonic
the Hedgehog blue
gravity mud mask now I review this on my
channel a while ago with Manny and
Nathan and I guess it was a kind of a PR
thing where it was only for promotional
use only and then the internet blew up
and it went so crazy and viral people
were like hi we want to buy that so last
month they finally launched this for the
brand it is basically exactly like their
silver gravity med which we've all seen
a million selfies of people peeling them
off now this one is a literally hot
metallic blue let me just open it up it
is so stunning I don't know why it's
like for me it's really addicting to
like put on masks that peel look how
beautiful it is by the way I'm like oh
my god this mask is amazing it's firm it
tightens it tones and for some reason
there's something really addicting about
peeling a mask off and just kind of
seeing your skin get a little revived so
if you've never tried this I definitely
recommend it it is actually something
that works so I do know that this
product is limited edition while the
blue one is so you better get it before
it's gone I'm like sitting there like I
need to buy like 12 but um if you've
ever used this let me know in the
comments below and let me know your
thoughts because it is one of my go-to
next up for skincare is from the brand
fresh they are one of my favorite brands
and Sephora now this is the Rose floral
toner you can use it before makeup you
can also use it to set your makeup or as
like a little refresher I mean I know
about you guys but
I'm throw today my nose is a little
cagey things start shifting it's hot out
it's cold out my makeups like what the
hell is going on
these are women get it were just kind of
like throughout the day a man notices a
little big to put in your purse which
y'all know I put this in my bag
now I literally can just spray a little
bit of it on and it kind of just revives
your makeup and gives you a little
moment and it literally smells like
liquid rose petals it's a very soft and
dainty I loved it so if you want to
hydrate and refresh definitely recommend
this guy before we get into a few
products that didn't work for Miss thing
right here I'm gonna dive into some
fashion now this is all about the brand
Christian at Lubert End
you guys already know I'm a red bottom
whore and now they recently put out a
lot of stuff from their brand 500 styles
of new shoes I can't keep up but these
anchors though are so stunning they are
basically so rocky rainbow sneakers and
my god I'm like a little bird when I see
something shiny I'm like hi I don't know
I just like when I see shiny things and
crystals I become enamored and I just
think that these are so beautiful to
match the shoes they came out with this
tiny little nano bag look at how dining
the detail is so you put this over like
a normal purse I'm just going to stand
up if my vagina shows I am so sorry it
is so cute so basically if you're
someone that only likes to you know
carry their cellphone a lipgloss and you
know maybe a tampon a dildo or a plan-b
you definitely should check out little
bags now it's time to get into my fails
this is basically let me get I guess I'm
going to say it once and maybe I'm gonna
have to say it every month because
people love to twist and turn everything
around these days but what I mean by a
fail is that it didn't personally work
for me so of these products or anything
that I ever mentioned the future that I
don't like and it works for you
thank God it worked for you because who
wants to waste money on shit that they
don't fucking use but these items just
really kind of fell flat for me and I'm
going to go into detail of why so every
part I have a different experience with
obviously so let's dive into it now
first off girl I love her in the case so
much and I really hate having to justify
saying that y'all know more
the cave rider dyfan but their new vice
liquid lipsticks I don't know what
happened with these but I feel like it
was just kind of an epic fail for me now
I just watched these a few weeks ago you
can see how they looked on camera girl
they were not that great for some reason
I think the metallic ones were way worse
than the matte ones but they were so
long-lasting a lot of people do like
that so if you want to lipstick that
will you know out stand a nuclear blast
or anything crazy these are probably for
you but they were so drying and made my
lips like oh when I took it off it was
like it was not good
and I flicked them at Alice for really
just not amazing so I hope that they
maybe reformulate and put out other
shades and try to improve the formula
just not for me
now if you guys have tried these please
let me know in the comments below what
your experience was the next one is the
new Becca primer that just came out last
month now look I thought it was going to
be sickening it's a lavender or no this
is called the first light priming filter
instant complexion refresh such a long
talking this isn't spot but on so
basically this is supposed to like take
away all the dullness in your face once
you rub it in and supposed to kind of
revive you now it doesn't really do what
it says let's just put this on my hand
right oh my god that's just shot on my
leg okay so I'm just going to put this
on my hand you see what it's supposed to
look like now this isn't really like a
color corrector because it's not really
cancelling out anything it's definitely
supposed to give your skin an extra
little like boost of I guess light
energy you know if your skin is a little
dull this will definitely help but
here's really why it's an epic fail for
me oh my god okay if anyone is cleaning
their house with a lemon Lysol white or
that spray you clean wooden floors with
like it's on the back of my hand and I'm
like oh my god like stay back stay back
it just smells really like a cleaning
like product oh my god I don't like it
is very lemon a lifestyle you're about
to rub
a wooden suction chair and I just really
don't love it and at the end of the day
I feel like they maybe we're a little
late they were they were kind of
reaching with this one I didn't it just
didn't work for me and the smell I still
can't get over it
the last item for this video the last
fail is by the brand by Carrie now this
is a legend Lee an anti-wrinkle dark
circle eye bag serum corrector that's
not a mouthful now here's the thing the
formula was not terrible now I've used
way worse concealers but the formula was
also not amazing but here's my one huge
problem
this is $69 I'm like or cruise for a
concealer that is really really up there
of course bite care is a luxury skincare
makeup brand but here's the problem this
shade is called fair let me just double
check yes this is number one
fresh fair so basically this is the
lightest shade this was not light enough
for me I think I am a I mean my skin is
pale but there's also a million girls up
there that have the same problem where
they just really can't find a light
enough concealer I don't know what the
fuck is wrong with brands putting out
five shades on my girl there's a whole
vast world out there and for some reason
I'm not gonna put this on my face I'm
gonna put this on my hand real quick
like for some reason I was really high
hopes for this concealer now I was limit
out pretty it's kind of like a it's not
the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer but
not as creamy but the color I was kind
of offended it just wasn't light enough
for me it was just hmm I don't know how
I'm just like if brands are going to put
a concealer you might want to put out
like 15 to 20 shades to start off and I
don't know so when I put it on it
literally like was darker than my skin
tone and I'm like so what's the opposite
of concealing because this was just not
for me so this was definitely a fail for
me and hopefully they can expand their
color range and I might give it another
whirl and that concludes my holy grails
and fails for January 2017 oh my god you
guys this year is like I mean you know
this year just started
like it's going to fly by and I'm really
hurt about it but um thank you guys so
much for watching this video now if you
guys like me incorporating products that
didn't like of course please sound off
down below and let me know your thoughts
obviously I am filming all these videos
for you guys and that it was very highly
requested but did you like it
let me know down below and yes I will
see you guys in the next one I love you
mom bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
