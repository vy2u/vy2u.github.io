entire life

lay back

Texas the humidity and the heat have
been so crazy I'm just like my skin is
like bitch you better get back to
California but good news is I will be
back on the Warped Tour for the Detroit
Minnesota and Chicago dates and before

something a little special this has been
such an incredible week I'm ready for a
nap though I am ready for a nap thank
you for everyone that came out to the
signings that brought all those Cinnabon
delights girl those are almost as good
as all the hugs I got but you guys are
so funny for bringing all that stuff
thank you for so much love the lines
have been bigger than ever even bigger
than when I was doing music so this is
such a surreal moment the fact that
we're selling makeup on Warped Tour is
unreal it's really never been done
before so I'm just thankful that I could
be the first person coming from someone
that was on that stage from 2000 and
like was the first time I did it 2007
which was nine years ago I'm like oh my
