I brought a friend with me today hi I'm
Jay kissa
and we're going to be showing you guys
some new velour liquid lipstick colors
launching for the fall and we're gonna
give you a little sneak preview of my
lower lip scrub this little guy is a
vegan sugar based lip scrub I know a lot
of brands have them but I kind of wanted
to make my own formula in my own way and
make flavors that no one else has and
they smell so good they are delicious
don't replace these lip scrubs as a meal
so this is not like it's not lunch and
dinner but it is a slight dessert I'm
launching four flavors this one that
we're gonna be trying today is spearmint
it smells oh so good it smells like gum
it's really good speaking of gum I have
a strawberry gum flavor coming out a
root beer float and a mojito oh for all
of our drinkers out there um these are
launching end of September we have no
lipstick on which is very weird for me I
feel kind of naked yeah me too I feel
really weird I'm like hi how are you um
but we're about to do some swatches for
you and show you some new colors first
we're gonna swatch my new color called
masochist it is like a darker version of
prom night it's a more berry based color
in the bottle it almost looks identical
to prom night let me grab that this is
prom night and this is masochist but on
the lips they dry way different prom
night is like neon in your face hi good
morning pink and masochism or berry dark
one our eyes are a little crazy and
neutral I know I have this crazy gold on
so if I look a little while and some of
these colors excuse me yeah and it's
nice because a lot of Pink's on me if
you like make my teeth look more yellow
wear this one like I waited for the
white so I'm always down for that
that's a good thing yeah how do I look
you look here's always the next shade
we're going to be swatching is this
beautiful chocolate brown this one is
called dominatrix and I've never made a
shade like this before
I know I'm so excited it's gonna go so
well it's gonna with breakfast your
neutral eye oh I love it when I wear
this to bed on the words to target I
want to wear this to Ikea I want to wear
this one I'm having an orgy teeth look
white I want to mix it with what
I'll be amazing I love the shade I'm
like wait I created it first I love it
but for real I love the shade i normally
would never wear brown and brown lips
are very trendy right now and i was in
the lab and i was like let me try to
make my version of like a brown lip so
many people have done it and I want it
to look like chocolate I do have a candy
desert fetish but ice creams tattoo all
over me definitely wanted to do some
something that reminded me of like
chocolate drizzle and some ice cream
yeah do you think it looks so good on e
on my whole it looks so good on you I
really like it it looks so different on
both of us good does on
next one we're gonna be swatching is
actually one of the first three colors I
ever put out this one is called prom
night and I've gotten a lot of comments
and stuff on the internet about watching
them next to masochist since you don't
want to seem that yet so we're going to
be swatching this one just like a little
old throwback and we're going to show
you a comparison side-by-side um both
cup this is prom night
this is masochist very different both
amazing so to show you guys the
difference between masochist and prom
night I went ahead and did prom night on
my bottom lip and then masochist on my
top lip the next shade we're gonna be
swatching is a new limited edition one
that currently doesn't have a release
day I'm just going to surprise everybody
um and this one is called dirty money
inspired by being dirty I was getting it
does remind me the color of money
mm-hmm it's a very unique color nowadays
with so many brands out there it's hard
to make colors that has been you know
that hasn't already been done before
yeah and I think this is pretty unique I
did you know makes my teeth white oh yes
this would look really good with a
completely blacked out smokey eye maybe
some silver green glitter or like
graphic liner I'd be really whoa yeah a
lot of options and in case you didn't
know all of my liquid lips are vegan
they are ice safe and a lot of people
use them as liquid eyeliner and they
look amazing so be daring look at
