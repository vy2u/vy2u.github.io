channel today I am so excited to talk
about a collaboration that has been in
the works for months and it's finally
about to see the light of day we are
going to talk about the GA cosmetic
jeffree star collaboration I am so
excited to reveal everything and there
is even a tutorial in this video so
after I talk about the product we
meaning lipstick Nick my makeup artist
is here for today's video and we're
going to show you how to create this
wild candy cotton candy fantasy now
let's jump into the collaboration
earlier this year I actually broke my
virginity of having a discount code for
a makeup company you all know if you've
been watching my channel for a while and
very against having codes for me
personally I don't care what my friends
do it that's obviously how a lot of
youtubers and makeup artists make money
they offer discount codes for products
I've always been someone that I never
wanted a code I've never taken money to
review a product I always want to be a
hundred percent really real from me to
you guys and that's just how I feel but
I did team up with you a cosmetics
earlier this year and I got my first
ever coat for one purpose only and that
purpose was to give back and to team up
with a charity so we have teamed up with
the LGBT Los Angeles center here in
California and every earning that I made
from the code early this year has been
donated to them and now I just want to
talk about it before we unveil the
amazing a lip topper now before we
unveil and talk about everything I do
want to say that the proceeds from this
entire collaboration will be going to
charity so I'm actually not keeping a
dollar I am a very blessed and fortunate
to have five other businesses that do so
astronomically well that I wanted to
team up with in a brand that believed in
me and a brand that I believed in who
was willing to do something for charity
and just help me show my vision so I am
really really excited to talk about this
today means relay Cosmetics have had a
really great relationship I love their
products they have amazing liquid lips
and highlighters but their star product
in my eyes is their amazing lip toppers
none of these have coconut oil in them
the formula is like this just be
you can wear these alone or on top of a
lipstick right now I'm sure most of you
have seen these in with some of my
favorites videos or you've seen them in
tutorials but here are a few of their
lift Stoppers these are unbelievable I
am such a fan of the tan line skinny dip
frostbite rose gold they're just an
amazing product
now I'm someone where of course we all
know I do have my own brand I would
rather team up with a another brand and
do an amazing thing with their product
rather than try to create the same exact
thing I think there are so many brands
out there that are being innovative and
cool let's all support each other so as
you guys can see today I am wearing the
lip topper that I created with Joey on
my mouth so when you get the product
here is the beautiful baby pink chrome
box knavish your weight has never really
changed their packaging colors before
even on top of their components so I
thought that it was really cool that
they were willing to go the extra mile
of course you see the little Geoffrey
sort of signature on here under the logo
and they have sprinkled the box with
stars everywhere we even have the JSE
logo on the side all here of course it's
Hollow and it's on the top as well and
of course the name of the product is
sweet tooth and it is right on the top
so once you open it you see that of
course normal joy products have a black
top sweet tooth comes with a baby pink
chrome top with the of course logo right
there BAM I just want you guys to really
look at the product in the vial it is so
glittery and beautiful and blinding and
this is actually as your ways first time
putting this much glitter in a product I
was like you guys know your calabria
Jeffrey sorry to turn up the glitz and
the glam and they were all about it
shout out to the entire ziwei cosmetics
team you guys have been so amazing to be
with and be on trips together and this
collaboration just means so much to me
this product will retail for $16 so for
something special I know other
influencers have codes we're going to do
something a little different with this
launch and you are actually only going
to be able to get a discount at checkout
if you use my code which is an all caps
J star we'll put it right here and of
course this will be launching on August
26 at 10 a.m. Pacific Standard
time if you do not know your time zone
girl pause this video and do a quick
Google search few other people will be
getting it beauty leash calm which is
one of the our favorite online retailers
to buy makeup they will have it and for
all my UK and European customers you can
shop on beautybay calm and girl they
don't get a right to your house for
everyone out there watching this just
thank you for supporting such an amazing
collaboration I hope you love the color
and now we are about to dive into this
tutorial and talk to Nicole for a minute
and we're going to show you how this
product looks of course by itself and
even over a lipstick because girl both
ways I'm shook all right let's dive into
it alright and here we are marker if you
guys have not met Nicole on my channel
yet this is a lipstick Nick aka Nicole
and she of course transformed me into
this beautiful cotton candy dream on set
and on camera to date so what was your
inspiration for this look fruity fun
colorful summer just everything yes
pirate sweet tooth it was a cool
expression so it was really cool and the
whole all the candy from the photo
shoots was so like they're so fun yeah
the lollipops and like the swirling of
the colors and just everything yeah
we're going to throw up some of the
images right now from the campaign what
is your favorite one the one was a
sucker holding my eye right here yes no
hi diet eyes like old Hollywood glam
meets like yeah the one with the role
like shear tool rapper and her head was
so everything that name like editorial
just like the eyes fashion that was I
was living and then we're going to show
this image right here of the cult glued
some crazy like gems and stones to my
eyes I was so like everything to
do you know I love gems yeah so I was
like okay we're going to incorporate
that in save the bangs yes oh my gosh so
these pictures right here with the
yellow bangs I'm only wearing the lip
topper in that one it was like
mind-blowing and then with the green
hair we actually put on like a hot pink
liner and put the lip topper over it
yeah and it's just so cool how you can
use it in so many different ways yeah
definitely we wanted to show like a
bunch of different ways to wear it like
alone with something underneath it and
nude a pink liner
so hey I'm excited all right well if you
guys want to see Nicole transform I mean
to the cotton candy fantasy then keep on
watching for primer we're going to go in
with the new Marc Jacobs undercover
perfecting coconut eye primer all right
next are going to go on your brow bone
we're going to use a little bit of China
white from the Beauty killer palette
hey such a classic
alright next we're going to do a little
bit in the crease and we use the star
power from the beauty killer palette if
you want to hop in girl this is the one
the hottest
we're ready to go underneath the eye
with this bright orange from the busy
our editorial palate and love that one
I'm going to defuse this bright orange
here with Courtney from the beauty color
palette and there's some kind of
blending all the way down and around
next to ready for this aqua color that
we're going to pop right in here and to
do that we're going to use this blue
from the sugar foot palette and mix it
with a little bit of white to kind of
make it lighter and this is the pro
palette you can build your own on their
website and their bottom all right now
we're going to go into the Anastacio
beverly hills aurora glow kits which
shade you own dip into oh yeah okay cool
now to keep packing on I just wet a
little bit of fix+ on my hand and I'm
kind of dipping that into the hell yeah
that was not a good thing
hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah Nana Cole
is going to dip into the issue ways
skinny-dip ultra foil is shimmer shadow
palette this is one of my favorites we
went to San Tropez earlier this year and
debut it I love the formula on this and
of course remember if you want to buy
this use code J star at checkout to stay
a little coin baby next we're going to a
little bit of white liner on Jeffrey's
waterline and this is the Mac
fascinating.i Kohl pencil
right the difference yeah it's really
frightening all right now for mascara of
course we're going to be using my
benefit cosmetics limited edition Beauty
stowaway jeffree star a roller lash this
is in every Sephora in stores in America
and Canada right now and it's available
on sephora.com just easier for me to do
my own so I'm just going to put this on
and then we're gonna do some falsies
this is my favorite for bottom lashes
because it almost looks like you have
policies on and make the illusion from
one side to the other girl mmm I think
next we're going to use these blushes
culprits Tina by flutter it's like a
blend of brown and black hair and almost
like is it cool like highlighted Asian
and we love that they're called
Christina because the owner of issue a
cosmetics that's her name so this is
kind of fading oh I see next up is
highlighter give that glow on the fan
uses away
skinny-dip highway which is beautiful
it's a stunning blinding gold hit my
cheeks and I'm going to kind of blend
this up into this like soft brownie
orange color so there's kind of melt
together
all right now it's finally time to apply
the issue a cosmetics jeffree star lifts
tougher in shade sweet tooth now I am
going to show you guys how it looks on
my lips fair and then we're going to
actually put down a nude lip and show
you how it looks on top because oh my
god we do both on set and it was done
Ning so let's have you do it just by
itself first
so the reflective properties and this
are insane I think I'm actually going to
go step outside as well and show you
guys how it looks in the direct Sun it's
like literally confetti for your mouth
alright now I'm going to demonstrate how
the lip topper it looks over a liquid
lip
of course you can put this over a cream
lipstick any color I'm just going to do
my favorite is your way lip cream nude
this is shade buff oh my god girl here
is the buff on the mouth of course by
itself it is stunning but let's make it
more stunning if someone's going to take
sweet tooth now of course you can go
right from the applicator what Nicole
likes to do one set she'll take an
actual lip brush and just put it on
product on our hand and do it from there
it really doesn't matter of course I use
the applicator now what I like to do is
put it in the center of the lips take
your finger and just go like this
so it gives your lips that extra
dimension of course we'll do a little
bit on top or right in the center oh
girl so of course it does add an amazing
blinding touch so if you are someone who
loves shine and sparkle you are
definitely going to love putting this on
top of all your favorite lipsticks here
is the final completed look I think this
is like amazing this is the right
favorite looks exactly like me just
looking at it I'm like oh my god is like
wrongly hating on my face yeah so I just
want to quickly shout out Nicole for
coming over and transforming me back
into the looks with such a fun @im ones
