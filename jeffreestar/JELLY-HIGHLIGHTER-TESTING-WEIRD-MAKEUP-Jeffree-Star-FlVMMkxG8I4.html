what's up everybody welcome back to my
channel today we are doing a highly
requested review on a brand new
highlighter that is about to hit the
market in Jesus H am i excited about
today because not only is this a first
of its kind in the makeup industry it is
supposed to be blinding and you can put
it everywhere on your face your ass your
cheekbones your testicles and your whole
entire body so we might just do that in
a minute we are talking about the brand
new far sadly highlighter
holy let's open this bad bitch up
so of course this was sent to me it
comes with a first of all I love the
packaging that it came with okay it's
like hi and it has of course all the
tidbits about what is supposed to do but
let's take this bad boy out because this
has gone a little bit viral all over
Instagram and I have gotten so many
messages to try this out and review it
so here is what the beautiful component
looks like of course the brand's logo is
on top with the this isn't a compact
this is kind of like a jar I guess we'll
call it on the back it says jelly beam
illuminator and this is shade glazed so
of course I'm sure they're gonna put out
more shades but here is the first
initial one with a crazy brand new
formula that I guess is really the first
of its kind for highlighting all right
so of course it screws off and there is
the lid there is some product on the top
of course and here's what the inside
looks like you see it shaking right
there I don't want to tip it over but we
will show a little bit but see it oh it
moves baby no this is not a liquid like
it's not gonna just rain out it does
have like a jello like consistency so I
don't want touched yet all right now
most of you have heard of farce sadly
before because they create the rose gold
elixir which of course went viral
everywhere last year and a lot of
youtubers and makeup artists use it now
there's also the unicorn essence of
course which I even used in previous
videos for a primer I love this for a
primer and their brand is really cool
because they are starting out small and
they were they are really like getting
to know their audience from a consumer
standpoint you know they've had one
really huge hit product they created a
second one that's been a hit now
moving on to makeup products which I am
really excited for but does it work is
it a flop is it a hit is it Jeffrey's
are approved we're about to find out in
a minute
so this guy is going to retail for a $40
so yes this is a luxury highlighter I
know a lot of you are gonna be like this
is a more of a luxury item of course so
this basically is an innovative
highlighter that apply is like a gel but
sess like a powder hmm
okay that's interesting leaving behind
the elusive wet satin glow forget
locking your cream in liquid with powder
for a no-slip finish all right so what
makes this product so special this is
supposed to be infused with far Sally's
skincare DNA with some nice ingredients
to hydrate and moisturize and we're
supposed to be really radiated but this
says get your sunglasses ready
jellybeans concentrated buildable
pigmentation takes your look from lit
from within to show-stopping beaming
glaze in every level of luminous
luminous in between alright this is this
is a lot of claims so let's see if this
works also it says you can mix us in
with your favorite foundation for
customized radiance you can put it on
your shoulders your arms your legs for
full body bling I might have Nathan rub
this all over my naked body all right
let's get to applying so this says that
it could be applied on the high points
of your cheeks with a finger or blend it
out with a brush so we can use patting
motions or brush maybe we'll just do
both and then it says you can put it in
your foundation you can mix it with a
bunch of stuff oh my god work you can
even put it on your eyelids curl alright
so let's go in with our fingers first
I'm going to open this one more time and
okay I've been dying to touch this
haven't tried it yet so I'm sitting here
like mmm-hmm I just want to go it really
bad okay so oh okay it's not cold but it
feels cooling and then you guys see that
let's do a little soot one more woah oh
my god that's a lot I feel like this
could last you a long time because look
at my finger okay I don't wanna put too
much so let's start a little smaller who
knows what the hell is about to happen
so let's just go in of course you guys I
have no primer on just foundation powder
concealer and blush
contour of course so let's put this
right on our cheekbones whoa oh wow okay
so I am going to just Pat this in with
my finger holy obviously this is
not blended out yet but girl look in the
monitor I'm like that is beaming holy
 okay let the buffer out before it's
too late a lot of the times you guys
creams or liquids dry very quickly so
you want to move fast so you don't end
up with a streaky looking application
which I might be doing right now but
let's try okay it's looking a little
straight not streaky it's looking a
little like a better blend quick
there we go okay so the good news is it
doesn't dry instantly it gives you a
little wiggle room right now to blend it
out now you guys know I'm not really
about finger applications but sometimes
the hands do you good okay so now that
we've really padded this into the skin
let's take a step back and take a peek
so of course here is one side very matte
very clean and then here is the jelly
bean highlighter it's definitely giving
me that wet highlight appearance which I
live for like I just got dunked in like
gold liquid I just came out of the
shower like good morning should we keep
going let's keep going okay so now let's
take a tiny bit more here we go
mm BAM I'm scared okay I put I see that
that's a little oh and let's highlight
our Cupid's bow let's just do a little
bit and see what happens
oh wow okay this is actually really
really pigmented because girl I have
barely touching this and it's like good
thing is the more you rub it in it does
diffuse a little bit so if you're like
holy should I put too much you
definitely have time to manipulate the
product and move it around yeah okay so
there we a little Cupid's bow we got the
cheek to him girl okay now I definitely
want to try this side with a brush this
is the morphe y 14 from the gold chrome
collection so let's see what happens
when you take a brush and you go like
this
okay it wants to stick to it and it's
definitely sticking so there's what it
looks like I just barely dunked it and I
didn't do like a full full thing because
we already know my cheeks are gonna look
crazy so there is what the tip of the
brush looks like right there all right
you guys let's give this a whirl and see
how it applies oh okay may it put too
much on so before this dries I'm gonna
take this in the back of my hand and
just huh
whoa come on highlight let's blend this
out with this brush and see what the
hell happens whoa okay with the brush
you see how that got a little weird so
let me just blend this down and then I'm
gonna take my finger and manipulate the
product some more well of how blinding
this side looks already okay because
that the brush was not completely soaked
some of it kind of flicked right there
what you guys can see so I'm just gonna
take my damn Beauty Blender and just go
over that definitely the brush did that
okay I love how the top part looks I
just think it looks a little funny right
here so I'm gonna go in with my finger a
tiny bit see that right there in the
middle finger I am just going to buff
that in with mice there we go alright so
there we have it BAM all right
let's compare sides alright so here's
the side of course apply directly with a
finger I love how this looks I think
actually blended it I think better than
the brush type let's go over here so the
brush of course has these little little
little hairs so we're gonna zoom in
right here on these bristles the problem
is is these end bristles right here
flicked the product on up so when you
first saw that I'm sure a lot of you
were like what the but with my
finger I did blend it in and fix it I
just think that maybe that was not the
correct brush and the finger actually
worked better which is shocking I did
not think that was going to happen but
it did and this looks really pretty
am I looking in the monitor like alright
now let's go outside too quickly and
show you how this looks on the body all
right let's head outside alright you
guys we are outside now of course the
Sun is beaming directly in my eyes but
here is a highlighter in the direct Sun
I'm trying not to go blind here but it
looks beautiful I'm looking in the
reflection of my phone
like June looks very like I love it okay
so I'm going to take the product of
course and we're gonna put it on our
body and see how this looks so let's
open her up alright so I just grabbed a
little morphe fan brush this is the 510
you all know I've been using this since
day one on my channel and I'm just going
to take a little bit just like that and
let's just see how this applies to my
arm now I did put some on my hand
already but here is the product of
course on the arm now would not use this
brush really to blend I'm just showing
you guys how this looks
oof I love the luminosity alright now
I'm gonna take a little bit with my
finger I just took some product directly
from the top right there this is my of
course finger and let's just do this
side whoa you guys see that so you can
do really crazy intense or more sheer
down you guys know I'm more into the
intense highlight look this is really
easy to blend yeah I think fingers is
pretty good with this product because
look at that mm-hmm I'm gonna do a
little bit more on my hands see when you
rub it in right there
now it says that you can mix this with
the lotion of course but why bother I
don't want to share it down grow on a
glow from outer space I'm like I want to
like do a nude photo shoot really soon
and just douse my body in this alright I
don't have any sunscreen on and I feel
like I'm aging as we speak so let's go
back inside the studio alright you guys
we are back in the studio I am covered
in highlighter obviously this is an easy
review I think we tried out the
highlighter I can honestly give my my
thoughts already like girl this is
bomb how about that there's some
feedback there's my first impressions so
how was it
okay so look at my cheeks girl blinding
love it I love this I love this I love
this this looks so pretty in the Sun in
the studio lights of course it's still
really cute but definitely it was
blinding outside and I am obsessed with
that I'm like okay for summer they need
to come out with like 20 more shades so
get on it thank you
final thoughts you guys the Far Sally
jelly beam illuminator as of course
jeffree star approved hey definitely a
product I love it is innovative it is
cute and now the only thing I know
people are gonna probably complain about
is the price but girl if you're gonna
try something new that's innovative get
over it no don't really get over it if
you don't like it and because it's too
much money girl
there's a whole other world of
highlighters out there in the drugstore
but for something that is brand new I
don't really have a lot of Megan like
there's nothing negative to say about it
the thing worked it worked
- girl look at these cheeks
hmm now I do want to use this of course
in a tutorial coming up because I'm
dying to douse the jelly beam all over
my entire lid and give it that wet metal
look we all know I love glitter but this
could be next level so long story short
the highlighter worked I love it and I
can't wait to dust my entire body with
it I kind of want to take it and rub it
on Nathan's privates as well just to
give it that saving Ryan's privates feel
alright thank you so much for watching
this review hopefully you learned
something new today because I am
obsessed with this already I'm looking
in the monitor like every angle is
so ready
alright you guys thank you so much for
watching this review I will see you on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
