channel today I'm wearing Nathan's
clothing and no one to wear but today we
are going to dive into my July holy
grails and fails and girl the tea is
fucking hot in today's video we got some
good products that talked about
Sebastian some shoes and dildos so
before we dive into the video I just
wanted to say hi to everyone out there
and just chitchat for a second
July was really epic like I cannot
believe how quickly the summer has just
flown by I think whenever I do favorites
videos I like to think to myself like
okay what were like some big monumental
moments I had and in July I mean the
biggest one was me and Nathan bought a
house in Grand Rapids Michigan hey
shout out to all my Michigan is out
there I'm a resident so hold on to your
seats me and Nathan had been wanting to
get an investment property for a while
now I'm really really excited for the
next chapter for me and Nathan I know
everyone keeps being like when's their
wedding anyway my wedding ring this is
just jewelry that I like wearing we
don't have promised rings we don't have
celebratory rings we don't have chastity
belts and we definitely do not have
engagement rings we are perfectly happy
just how we are for now what will the
future hold you never know but besides
that you guys I'm really excited to be
in Michigan a lot spend some more time
there I love it out there it is so
peaceful so this is literally a spot for
us to go to of course as parents are
going to be living there they are going
to be taking care of the house it's
obviously theirs as well and I am just
ready to read a Stephen King book and
hibernate in the woods for a week every
month
besides that you guys I'm really really
excited because we are about a month out
from RuPaul's Drag Con so my brand
jeffree star cosmetics case you forgot
my brand and myself will be in New York
City
September 9th and September 10th and we
will have a booth I am also one of the
main cosmetics sponsors for the entire
event there's supposed to be like 20 30
40 thousand people there I'm like oh my
god I'm also really excited because I am
many MUA and laura-leigh they will be at
my booth we will all be doing signings
and their merch as well as my entire
brand will be available if you guys want
any info or a code to get a little bit
of a discount on some tickets that will
be linked down below alright if you're
done hearing me run my mouth and you
want to get into the damn favorites
video I'm sorry
keep on watching let's dive into some
makeup so I think something that I
covered my entire body with the last
month was the master chrome metallic
eyeliner from maybelline if you missed
this review last month I coated my
entire face in it it is that good but
all jokes aside this formula is bomb for
a drugstore brand to come hard like this
is better than Mac I was like oh okay
hunty so in case you did not see my
video I'm just going to take a clean
finger right here and just do a
once-over good morning this shit is so
blinding you guys I was a little shook
when I first tried it like look at that
powder I'm like oh wow bling bling bling
it is just so stunning and I just want
to rub it all over my body
it's blinding affordable and amazing so
really what more can you ask I think
that Maybelline is really killing it
with their formulas and they better
expand the shade range so I'm someone
that's very particular with their
concealers I've been using the same a
few for a long time now and I really
don't like to change because every time
I try a new concealer some horrible
happens or is just not for me it's hard
to get a flawless finish that does not
crease and fine lines or look weird or
cakey and I think I kind of found
something that I'm in love with and it's
not like the full of coverage on earth
which you might shock you all but it is
in that medium like stunning I don't
know why this is so good type of range
and this is the benefit boying airbrush
concealer I love that name now this
packaging is really cute this is new for
the brand and they put out a range of
concealers recently and this was the one
that stuck out to me now it is in this
turn like thing and as you see in the
pan it looks kind of mashed because I
like to take
Beautyblender I love to take the
Beautyblender dam and I'll literally
just go in there and then apply it
directly from the sponge and it looks
like I don't know I like fate which I
love I'm down to look fake if you don't
if you want to look really real well
you shouldn't wear makeup at all but
anyway I just love how this makes my
skin look it is really beautiful and has
a really good coverage so if you want to
try a new concealer try her out okay you
guys now this is a new primer that I
discovered on Sephora calm it is from
the brand touch insole now I discovered
them a while ago because they had these
crazy metallic I type of like liquid eye
paint things that I fell in love with
when I saw everyone using them but this
guy now I'm all down for new primers I
love testing stuff out on my skin I
click the link and it said smooth and
pore covering top secret for perfect
makeup so I'm like girl let me try this
out so I word on on the website it got
to my house I tried it with my like one
of my favorite foundation so that's
something I like to do you guys if you
have a favorite foundation and you want
to try a new primer stick to the
foundation because a lot of the times I
review so many things I like do a primer
and then all of a sudden I'm like using
a new foundation because I'm Michael I
just want to try this if you really want
to know if it works try it with
something that you already know what
it's going to look like so I've been I
mean you can see in the bottle I've been
going in on this one I'm wearing it
today it just makes the skin so like oh
I don't even know it's like you put it
on your pores are very minimal like they
kind of vanish which a lot of primers
claim matte and then as you see on this
channel they don't and the name though
is a little I don't know why the name
and annoys me it's called no pore bloom
like no problem but no pore bloom so
it's kind of a tongue twister but
besides the name the formula is so good
alright now I didn't think this day was
going to be here but I caved in and
Jacqueline Hill got me to buy the Dior
forever foundation and I was like okay
everyone says this is great but with
someone like not someone when a bunch of
people say something is great I don't
know why I'm like
that rebellious little like 12 year old
comes out when you and you're like don't
want it oh everyone thinks is a great
girl I'm done with the hype I'm good so
I do kind of get that attitude sometimes
so I was like no not doing it then I saw
Jacqueline use it for like the fifth
time in our video and I'm like bitch
does have good skin and it looks so
sickening when that foundation is on
earth so I'm like you know what mama by
n let me see what's going on now if
you've been watching these since I
started my channel you know that the
Dior air flash is literally my favorite
foundation on this planet I've been
using this for years and I recommend it
to everyone the formula is just Oh
insane if you go all the way back to my
channel in the very first video I know
I'm using this and I think I'm in the
second and the third video so I'm always
like you know what how can I even make a
better within this right
this is my eighth time wearing the Dior
forever foundation and I will say that
it is a top runner for the air flash and
my lemare I don't know what is in this
the formula it's amazing like of course
I'm wearing it today and I just love how
it it makes your skin still have that
kind of natural look but it still looks
a little plastic I know that's kind of
like hypocritical or doesn't really make
sense but like you look like you but
just a little more like a version of
yourself and this does last all day I
got know a lot of times I'm doing
foundation tests and by the end of the
night oh not so much but for some reason
this does last a long time and it has
sunscreen in it which you know
anti-aging bitch right here I'm all
about so if you do want to splurge on a
high-end foundation I would definitely
recommend getting a sample of this or
just buying it if you don't like it
return it but I highly recommend it the
next item on the Holy Grails is a
watermelon glow sleeping mask listen the
name first of all reeled me in okay the
baby pink packaging I'm done for I like
that it's simple it's glass it feels
heavy
the pink cap I'm like obsessed with and
now I feel like I'm a little girl again
so check this out it's hard for me to
really fall in love with like a skincare
brand that's new but a lot of you were
tweeting me this and you're like okay
bitch we know you love watermelon I know
have a watermelon lip scrub I just love
a fruit so people kept tweeting me this
thing and I'm like okay where do you buy
this so I type it in it's on Sephora of
course and I buy it and we are now three
weeks in and I'm obsessed with it you
put this on before you go to bed if you
want or you can use it as a mask and
wash it away in like 20 minutes but I
love to put it on right before bed sit
there let it soak in for however long
roll over you wake up and I don't know
what is in it that makes your skin feel
so a little baby like it's just so nice
so it's hard for me to really tell the
difference when you use all this shit
all the time like I try a lot of stuff
so when you see a lasting effect it's
kind of nice so this is a little on the
pricier side but skincare and if it's
good you got to pay for it in July I
reviewed this mask with Nathan on my
channel if you haven't seen it check it
out but this is the talkshow violet C
radiance mask now I've used about 747
times now throughout the last few weeks
and I really love how it makes my skin
feel during the day I wake up I cleanse
I put this on 20 minutes wipe it away
and I'm like oh she's feeling a little
younger so this is that purple mask if
you didn't see me review it check it out
now I haven't used a lot of this and
I've only done it on myself me get your
oh no no I'm just kidding but I really
really love tatcha I don't know why but
their brand is like consistently just
amazing and I'm falling more and more in
love with them I know they are a little
bit on the pricey side but if you want
something that works but you got to pay
for it
alright now let's dive into some fashion
now I am a high heel lover I know I was
born of the penis and I'm obsessed with
high heels so what is wrong with me
someone pray for me tonight please but I
am obsessed with Christian Louboutin I
have a separate closet just for my red
bottoms and this season jesus take the
wheel I had probably worn these a 4 or 5
times now
and these are is really cool like a
ballerina high heels they've been worn
girl than bread bottoms on say bread
forever and this wraps around your ankle
and it just looks so stunning and sexy
and elegant I love having sex in these I
love going out in these and they just
look really pretty and give you kind of
a dainty vibe if you are a dude but
still have shoes in generally they also
come in pink black and blue and I think
I have them all so if you love a sexy
heel or you want to wear something to a
party and fucking turn it up girl what
are you waiting for all right now my
bitch ass is going to start having a
section in these favorites videos that
is just like okay here's the most extra
item I got this month okay so me and
Nate love don't laugh at me exercising
with like basketball tennis air hockey
video games I'm down for anything you
guys take me to the shooting range and
I'll fucking I'll impress you but we
found that Chanel made like tennis
racket with balls of course of course
Chanel made balls and I about died when
I saw this so get a set of two and they
come in this of course the Chanel logo
is right here it looks so cute it opens
the zipper and then the best thing on
earth besides my ass is this racket okay
maybe not the best thing on earth but it
is pretty stunning to me because you
know my fashion whore I love a good
Chanel and this rakia girl this grip is
strong and get the low CC right here but
of course the star of the show is the
actual racket itself we took this out
the other day and of course you get a
cute little pouch full of balls who
doesn't want balls and you get four
balls they look like this I mean come on
Chanel tennis balls is like bitch I'm
down so if you want to come to Calabasas
and play around with us call me all
right now we are going to get to my
fails of July stuff that just didn't
really work out for me the first on the
list is going to be something that you
guys are probably like bitch how about
did you even find that well I
love Chanel makeup and a lot of a time
they got a hit their highlighters are
bomb we've had a few misses on my
channel but overall I love them actually
I'm obsessed with their powder I'm
actually wearing it right now I wear
this all the time bitch I'm about to hit
pan up in here but besides the powder it
has really good lip glosses actually
this is so fucking sad for the branch
only because they're melted honey lip
gloss was in my may holy grails
but a lip gloss that they recently put
out look at this guy's black lip gloss I
I expected something fucking amazing let
me show you what I got when I when I got
when I got home girl I don't know what
this is supposed to just for me when I
put this on my lips and I blend it out
I was like I've been sucking off a
volcano it was not cute it I don't I
don't get the point of it like girl and
then for 30 plus dollars I'm like I
really needed something to like have
some coverage show up like I don't know
I was definitely gonna have a gothic
moment again like high school but
nothing happened so I don't know what
this for maybe it's looks like dark
another lip colors or add some sorta
like Halloween feel I don't know but
this lip gloss flopped for me girl
subculture I know it just came out in
retail in August but this came out
really late July you know your girl
trying it out and I'm like I think this
palette has been through the wringer on
YouTube most of us by now have seen it
experienced it been shocked by it and
overall this palette just did not work
for me the formula was kind of off and I
wasn't living for it was extremely
powdery in which is fine and a lot of
you out there we're kind of like well if
it's powdery you know who cares so we're
a lot of palettes I get it this one was
just like extremely powdery and the
problem that most people had is it just
didn't blend amazing like their previous
shadows but you know I've said it before
overall the brand is amazing this
palette was just a big flop for me and
it's crazy how something like this has
turned into
such big makeup news and it is such a
search thing online thank you for
everyone out there that watched my
review I love that you guys watch a
bunch of people's reviews but then
you're like we really need the Geoffrey
approved stamps so that really means a
lot to me thank you guys for watching
that but overall this palette girl I'm
ready for their next palette that's what
I that's all guys all right you guys I
want to go downstairs and play with
these balls and a two balls and my own
balls I love you guys thank you for
watching today's video and I'll see you
on the next one what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
