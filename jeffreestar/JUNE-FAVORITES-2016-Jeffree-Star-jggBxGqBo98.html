just sitting here like every month I
feel like I'm gonna say the same thing I
can't believe this month went by so fast
but I really can't I'm sitting there
like oh my god were we are in summer
right now and June was a really crazy
month for me my Pomeranian delicious he
turned a year old
that's me Nate's son and I can't believe
he's already you're old I'm sitting her
like you know maybe at the end of the
year I might want a fourth dog I'm just
such a dog person if there's any other
crazy Pomeranian lovers out there if you
have a fleet of dogs like me please
leave me a comment and show me your dog
somewhere on Twitter I don't give a
what it is I just want to stare at
Pomeranians all day long besides that I
have been on the Vans Warped Tour of
course I will be back out there next
week and all the California dates in
August so we've been on a tour bus
Nate's been staying home and watching
the house for me all this traveling my
skin is like you bitch so I've just
been really trying to moisturize and get
like used to all these crazy climate
besides that life has been really crazy
I cannot believe this year is half over
my mind is like so I have a lot of cool
launches coming up from my brand I have
my whole summer collection coming out I
have a new eyeshadow palette coming out
in the fall more liquid lips and of
course you know I can't stop so right
now I'm actually designing and finishing
everything for spring 2017 the makeup
world is crazy so I am excited to
announce that I will be creating a
highlight and contour palette
the release date I can't tell you guys
yet but it's coming and I'm really
excited it's different there's a lot of
shades and get excited about it so
besides that I'm gearing up to leave for
Bora Bora in like three weeks I'm so
excited I have never been there and of
course you guys know I'm gonna film the
entire trip for my channel my Hawaii
vlog with Nate did so well I'm like okay
let me do more for you guys so I'm
definitely gonna be investing in a new
camera
I'm just rying to up my lighting game as
well and always try to improve for you
guys since you're the one watching me
and I do this for you so besides Bora
Bora I'm just like oh my god I'm doing
favorites now this is
fine so the May favorites thank you guys
for showing that so much love and let's
dive into June I'm gonna dive in with a
highlighter I'm sure you guys were like
hmm
but I am wearing the highlighter that is
in my favorites now I see a few other
beauty gurus and youtubers that did not
like this product which shocked me but I
am going to talk about the Pat McGrath
skin fetish highlighters I mean look at
this packaging now this is a silver one
I've already opened up the gold I've
been wearing it for weeks I wore it in
my video with Nicki in the Rose Royce
and look at that blinding light
of heaven these are sold exclusively at
Sephora and I think on her website now
Pat McGrath is one of those makeup
artists where whenever I get asked an
interview like who is your makeup
inspiration or your makeup Idol and I
never really have an artist in mind
except Pat she is phenomenal she has
killed a makeup game for years and she's
such an innovator like everything she
does is so different and like thinking
outside the box
try times 10 when you think about her so
when she came out with a highlighter
first of all I needed a fib you later
because I couldn't breathe and other was
passed out when I saw these now the
packaging is really amazing I think it's
really cute it's like in this little
sealed hologram bag full of sequins when
I first saw this for a second I'm like
do you crush up the sequins and then
they're a highlighter and I'm like okay
let me get over my clue this moment now
these are $72 which are a little pricey
for some people on their like finish you
got the wrong one
but they do come with this highlighting
brush and they come with a bomb and a
stick so basically like a highlighter
stick on this side and this one is
creamy I'm just going to show you guys a
little swatch right here beome so it's
like a cream bomb and you can put that
on your cheeks I like to apply it with a
Beauty Blender and then this also has a
clear one which this is very for like
artists so if you want to put this on
your lid on your cheeks to look really
glossy and sweaty like you just had a
gangbang this is amazing for that it
also comes with of course the
highlighter now I saw a lot of youtubers
talking because they thought the
packaging was you know a little dingy
and shitty now honestly Pat McGrath I
 love you but I did expect a
little bit more from this because this
is the same
component like an elf $3 highlighter
comes in and obviously you know I love
elf but I was like girl so besides the
packaging the product itself that's why
it's in my favorites do you see this
cheek bitch this is why I'm obsessed
so this brush is perfect you just swirl
it around after you put on the balm and
then it's just blinding it is so pretty
in the daylight and I've seen a lot of
people wear it recently I know Brett man
rock wore it when we were hanging out at
the fame Expo makeup convention a few
weeks ago and I was like oh my god Matt
hadn't worn this yet he wore and I was
like why why not try that yet so it is
one of my favorite highlighters right
now and I'm addicted have another makeup
product that I've been obsessing over
and using a lot off-camera is this brand
called supa Beauty I've talked about
that before I mean this product
obviously you guys are Public Enemy
these are called UV hydra liners now
these do glow in the dark and they are
so bright I decided for the first time
in about five years to not wear false
lashes if you're like oh my god why do
you look different it's because I wanted
the liner to have its own moment this
liner needs its own damn video these are
water activated and there's 12 shades
there's different finishes as well on
their website so this little guy is
$10.99 so of course as I said these need
water so I like to use a tiny little
pencil brush and this is from Smith
cosmetics perfect for liner so what you
do is you wet this and you have a little
bit of water in there you mix it around
and then voila it's like hi there thing
so I highly recommend them and these do
not budge I'm like hi there so I'll be
wearing these all summer long last
makeup product of my June favorites is
the Born This Way concealer from Too
Faced
oh listen when I try this on camera I
was like okay
another concealer every brand has it
obviously it's all about the formula so
when this hit my eyes I was like
okay I see they're not playing games now
this with a damp Beauty Blender or an
artiste brush we wing like it's just
amazing I don't know
what exactly is in this I know there's
magic and there's coconut water but let
me tell you this is unreal and my skin
type is very normal but I also use this
on my friend the other day which is very
oily and this worked amazing I think I'm
gonna say this a live on camera this is
my new favorite concealer now I've
talked about this I've used about this
in a lot of my videos this is my
favourite pre primer and I'll explain
why I say free primer in a second this
is the bobbi brown vitamin enriched face
base I think this little bottle is so
cute now I wish you guys could smell
this through the screen it is so fresh
it just has that skincare scent it comes
with a little lid for sanitization and
voila now what I love to do is I'll take
a damp Beauty Blender and I just like to
scoop some out and I will coat it on my
entire face which I've done in a lot of
videos and this is good for any skin
type and one of my videos a while back I
said it wasn't but I was actually
mistaken slapped me in my face this is
good for everybody it's just it's my
go-to for a long time I discovered this
one another makeup artist did my face
and she use this and I was like oh good
so it's just been in my kit ever since
and I'm obsessed right now my last
skincare item for June is voila the glam
glow gravity mud mask I'm sure you guys
are not surprised now a lot of my
friends that are youtubers were like oh
my god that sponsor video is so cute
with Manny and Nate and I'm like no one
sponsored me bitch if I like something I
use it and I want you guys to try it and
see if you guys like it as well so no
one paid us to use these masks I am just
a fan of the brand and when the owner
sent me a care package after she saw me
using her stuff I was like oh my god
this is like the best thing ever
because I mean hi I am obsessed with
these so this mask is perfect for
tightening and just looking all around
artificial and I love the color I love
peel-off masks so this is just one of
those items you must have let's dive
into some fashion now I am a sunglasses
whore I know
never done a skincare video we get but
let me give you one tip when I'm driving
in the car when I'm walking outside when
my skin is even near the front door I
have sunglasses on now I'm trying to
never have crow's feet I am just trying
to you know never age I'm all about
anti-aging now skincare is not the only
thing you can do for anti-aging wearing
sunglasses is a big part of my regimen
for being a youthful now I found these
glasses on Instagram this is from a
brand called acne studios a lot of the
times when a really high late at night
I'm scrolling through I'm looking
through the jeffree star cosmetics
hashtags to repost everybody and I'll
stumble across so many dope artists and
so many people that just have really
cool stuff and you know I find a lot of
stuff that I've never heard of before
which way this comes in now these are
sunglasses if you've ever seen me do a
snapchat rant or just keep it really
real you'll probably see me in mirrored
aviators or something crazy
these guys are unreal I love big glasses
now when you don't have eyebrows like me
you sometimes can't wear straight across
glasses that just don't translate so
when I found these I was like ooh when I
got them they came in as a big box you
open it up and the sunglasses come in
this leather case which I thought was
really cute and as a little job string
and then there they are now of course I
had to get the matte black these are
like high Terminator or Sochi girl and
then I saw these ones and these are the
ones actress on Instagram and I was like
oh that mirror those look Conchie now
these retail for 430 dollars each now I
don't know what this brand is big or not
I did some research and I saw some
people doing like unboxings on YouTube
of like some of the clothes that this
brand made so I don't know I like to
support things that I see online and I
think this is sickening
now as you guys know I am a handbag
collector and in June I found a new love
for little bags now usually I am like a
big bag person I'm one of those people
worried if you have to dive in you have
everything from lip balm to hairspray to
setting spray to maybe even to wallets
and sunglasses and more settings brand
lipsticks and makeup
in an inhaler and a pipe girl I like a
big bag but when I'm traveling and I'm
on the go sometimes I just have a little
you know little purses so the color pink
is really hard to find in fashion like
pink goes like that
so I found these two bags which oh my
god my camera is like holy bitch
now this first one is a little Jeeva
sheet bag this is perfect for like going
on the airport it has a strap which I
love a strap and the second bag is from
Balenciaga I love them
I mean I'm sure you guys have seen these
bags everywhere they're all over
Instagram they come in a billion colors
but neon highlighter pink oh okay so I
love these for traveling I brought this
on Warped Tour for a few days and it was
perfect for just a little on the go bag
so small little bags might be something
I'm starting to become a little more in
love with I'm scared
Hey okay so for the last part of the
video now what happened last time last
time apparently we brought a little too
much cannabis into the picture and you
know I guess YouTube was like okay 15
seconds that's great but any longer than
that we're gonna flag the video which we
don't mind and doesn't matter it's the
rules but um we're back for another
segment of what's our favorite strain so
of course if you don't like marijuana
and you just want to go have a beer by
fast forward we uh we like to try out a
lot of different strains so you know we
try mostly sativas because most of the
indicas are more sleepy we don't smoke a
lot of weight before we go to sleep but
when we do we just want something to
kind of put us to sleep very relaxing
yeah you know so I think we found a
really really good strain that is so
relaxed you're just like melt on the
couch really focused I'll bang out like
60 emails okay and watch a movie and
what's it called it is called gorilla
glue number four yeah now I don't want
to get flagged again so we're just not
going to show everything
my god wood is so pretty the whole
background of the the gorilla glue name
is basically it glues you to your couch
allegedly what it stands for and it's
actually really good to have sex on all
right everyone that concludes my June
favorites now I'm just sitting here like
okay there are so many new makeup
products out if you want me to try any
new products that you have discovered
that I having it I know there's a lot of
dope stuff on Etsy and there's so many
brands and everything is just like it's
so overwhelming but um let me know you
guys want me to try do any more first
impression videos I love doing those now
that we are diving into summer I'm gonna
go put on some setting spray go get some
Cinnabon delight and I will see you on
the next video bye guys
