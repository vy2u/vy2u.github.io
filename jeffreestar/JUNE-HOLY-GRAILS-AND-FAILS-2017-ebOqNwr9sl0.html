channel and today we are going to be
diving into my June Holy Grails and
through the month of June I always stay
here when I do favorites videos and
disappointment and I'm like what the
hell happened this month well I guess I
think the biggest change of all is
obviously I'm blonde
I still have blonde hair it's been like
three weeks and I'm kind of loving it it
feels like a limb is missing or like it
feels like a part of my soul is just not
really present without the pink hair
because I've had it for literally ten
years but um it's cool it's a different
change I'm starting to like it
definitely going to do hot neon peach or
pink in a few months because I don't
know how I don't know how long or less
but we'll see besides that in the makeup
world there were so many launches this
month we had the Jacqueline Hill morphe
palette we had my chrome collection we
had Kylie's vacation summer launched we
had Kim K's infamous contour sticks
which has caused such a ruckus online
and there was just a lot of launches
this month I don't know if you guys
support all four of us but there's just
so many people supporting all of the
different launches and it's cool to see
everyone just sharing their love and
obsession for makeup and that's why
we're here so it's just really cool to
see everyone be excited about products
now I know a lot of you were skeptical
about my Kim K contour stick review
because I did make a one small mistake
and you guys know I'm always down to
clock myself and call myself out I did
not show how much product was in there
and a lot of you were like Geoffrey you
always talk about the weight whatever
honestly I don't review sticks ever so I
did not think to twist this stick out
all the way and there was really not a
lot of product and as so many people
were mad about this brush girl I even
said in my video the sponge
sucked I did not like it this blended it
out was it the best thing on earth and
no girl you know I'm a Beautyblender
whore but I'm at the end of the day
there are so many other youtubers that
have reviewed the product of some love
it mani hates it Laura loves it
talk to you thought it was cool
and the cool thing about making these
videos we're all going to have different
experiences there's primers
using my friends on a girl this make my
pores look disgusting I'm going to say
it right here now if you ever leave a
comment hinting or even joking like oh
girl you're on this person's payroll so
you're going to say it's great bitch I'm
the one that threw Kylie's lip gloss
swans in the trash last year and ended
up on CNN so don't try to act like I'm
on someone payroll but anyway besides
that you guys let's dive into my
favorite products first and then we're
all talking about a few that kind of
sailed for me so besides that I'm just
going to talk about my first favorite
product I guess right now because it
definitely has to do with drama this is
the Jaclyn hill of morphe palette I'm
sure most of you if you have a computer
have seen this amazing palette let me
open her up you guys I'm going to be
really real I mean I I'm a fan of morphe
I like their products in general I know
there's always controversy about people
pushing them and no one else we would
trust and are they good are they bad
morphe is such a solid company and this
is the problem a bitch that drips in
Chanel makeup and Tom Ford and I love I
mean I like brands at work and morphe is
always consistent okay so when I heard
that Jacqueline was going to be making
this palette I was really excited
because she always has great ideas and
we high champagne pop and what so when I
saw the colors I was like okay this is
really cool because not everyone can buy
a hundred palettes a year there are so
many launches all the time it's like I
don't know how the you guys keep up
I can barely even hold on to my seat so
when I saw the color like story and
everything I put together I was like oh
my god this is genius because you can
literally create so many looks from its
palette so let's zoom in because these
pans are definitely being a used I think
this top row is just really easy and
everyday so what I'm wearing on my eyes
you guys is actually this is the
highlight this guy right here it looks
almost like a matte in the pan okay
clean finger let me just go like this it
is really blinding so I put that in the
inner corner right here and I'm using
this one this one this one and this one
in the
all over and it's a really just nice
easy palette
they're definitely pigmented I know a
few shady youtubers tried to swatch them
and say that they weren't pigmented
y'all are shady and you
try to do jacqueline dirty and you're
wrong for that this palette is amazing
it is definitely pigmented it blends
like a butter anyway besides that I'm
just going to talk about one more morphe
product you guys know I hardly ever put
more few products in my favorites but I
don't want to sound like one of those
bitches but I will say this you guys a
month or two ago they put out the prep
and set makeup setting spray girl listen
I've tried a lot of thinning sprays in
my day I love being doused whether it's
in the morning or in the afternoon or at
night
I love being doused and my face ellipse
for it so this is really good for when
I'm done with my foundation my concealer
my contour I powdered my entire mug I
love just spraying this on and just
letting it all like mmm like blend
together and just I don't know which six
tool is really refreshing and look at
that the aerosol it's like it's not like
a spray it's literally just like oh it
is just so refreshing and I love like
touching up my makeup throughout the day
and like literally I'll put this in my
purse because that's what I do and I
love taking a Beauty Blender it is kind
of like patting it all in and literally
my foundation stays longer than normal
so definitely a big fan of it and morphe
is very affordable so if you're like on
the fence about some of these setting
sprays because I know when I try to load
of
this one is 14 and 99 I think it is a
really good deal and it's a lot of
product in here alright next alright
next up on my favorite is the Kylie
cosmetics wet set highlighters oh my god
okay first of all shout out to everyone
who watched my review and thank you guys
for always trusting and believing in my
opinions and what I have to say it's
unreal how many of you watched this like
over 4 million already in just under two
weeks I'm like this was the star of the
show in the collection for me I know I
talked about in that video but
privacy please this top highlighter it's
just unreal the texture
is very just weird and cooling and soft
it's just so silky I mean literally a
blinding mirror I just love the formula
it goes on the skin just beautiful it's
just I don't know I know I mean everyone
else a stunning so much but girl like
look at that I really hope that they
make more shade in this formula because
I really love it I know a lot of you
were like okay Jeffrey does it feel like
the color pop eyeliner it does kind of
have that gel like texture but this one
is even more intense and it almost feels
cooling in a weird way I just really
love the formula and I know I think the
sold out in like two minutes so we're
crazy and I'm sure whoever has this out
there agrees with me it's next up on the
list I got to do a little shameless plug
for myself because I had a really crazy
launch for my own brand
so jst of course had the chrome summer
launch with a bunch of stuff from the
lift
ammunition guys skin tight which is what
I'm wearing on my mouth right now it's
just an easy classic nude you can use it
with a lip pencil if it's too light but
I just loved I'm sorry I'm like and from
the liquid lip collection I know I am a
matte lip whore but I love the metallics
that I've been making and this one is
called a candy ass it has been such a
hot seller you guys are coming really
hard for this pink rose gold moment and
I really love this I've been wearing
this a lot lately as well I just want to
give a quick little thank you to
everyone that has supported the
collection is thus far it has been like
we like we look back at last summer and
it's literally quadrupled in sales and
the growth of the brand you know my
little baby that I started only two and
a half years ago has just grown
astronomically and of course it would
not be where it is without you guys so
thank you so much for believing in my
formulas and my brand all right next up
for makeup this is the last makeup item
in the video we have the brand new
maybelline superstay matte ink basically
like liquid lip heaven I really love
these first of all let's talk about the
packaging for a liquid lip I think it is
really cool
I love how of course the colors coincide
with the component on the
outside so you know what you're getting
and you know every liquid lip has like a
window where you can see the shade this
one doesn't it has the color and I kind
of like it it's different it looks kind
of futuristic I know everyone has their
opinions about packaging I like it now
the color that I've released I got to me
that I've been wearing lately this one
is called loyalist I'm just going to
swatch it for you guys
because I love it and I love that doe
foot it's like that little shaped moment
this shade is so pretty nude you guys I
live for it and the other one that
really stuck out to me is this shade
dreamer it's a beautiful like mauve nude
if you know me my hand swatches oh that
shade is so pretty
I really love those too they also have
this really really bright one called a
heroin it is I mean you guys to the
plastic it's wild but let's just swatch
a little bit right here oh if you're
someone that really loves the bold
bright summer-like colors you're going
to love this and I love the formula it
feels really lightweight and these stay
on for a long I want to note that in
between takes of likes watching stuff I
like to wipe them off because I am
notorious for getting stuff on my
clothes that liquid lip did not want to
come off and I've barely had on my hand
for like a minute so I imagine on your
mouth they stay on all day and you can
definitely do some activities that I'm
like we're talking about right now
alright so besides makeup you guys know
I'm a fashion whore and if you didn't
know now you know so I love to talk
about my favorite sunglasses of the
month I always share with you guys what
I've been seeing very screenshot on
snapchat and these ones you guys girl
let me just put these along these babies
on so these are like coffee glasses
these are from Versace and another
bougie I'm just obsessed with how they
look girl
nothing like turning your head and
seeing a highlight and then sunglasses
like why does that get me off I'm just
like now I love this because it has a
little V detail right here and when me
and talk to you were in in Vegas
recently which of the Versace store and
at the crystals mall and I got these
there I love it I love this metal thing
it's like I don't know so if you're a
sunglass whore like me check these out
before they're gone
alright last but not least in this
fashion realm Louie Vuitton recently put
out these amazing bags where they teamed
up with an artist named Jeff Koons and
they let him
take like really famous paintings like
the Mona Lisa and then go and put them
on handbags oh my god listen from from a
bag whore like myself I about gagged
when I saw this look at this beautiful
DaVinci bag of course Leonardo DaVinci
created and painted the Mona Lisa who I
actually have tattooed on my body and I
love it because she has no eyebrows and
he knew July by the way what is Mona
Lisa with a man they don't ever think
about that ever maybe I don't know so
this bag you guys is so what
stunning when you open it you can
actually read about the painting in here
it gives facts that literally says the
era that it was done the Year 1503 I
think I was like four it has is
beautiful
like a peachy color in here the bag is
so stunning with all the hardware like
involved in it it like you can feel it
but it's like in the leather it's so
stunning there is a just signature and I
am just obsessed with this I think it is
so cool they have a whole collection of
bags and wallets and I'm just a huge fan
so if you are a Louie collector out
there anyone watching or if you just
love a handbag try to snag something
like this because it is so good to have
for your collection and if you're
someone that just like the stare at
like I'm obsessed I like put this out in
front of my bed and I was just like
looking at it for a minute like alright
you guys now it's time to get into a few
disappointments and when I say
disappointments I always kind of want to
put it out there these are not things
that I hate this is just
something that did not work out
personally for me or a product that I
have an issue with so I do want to
always say something like that because
you don't see we're trying to try it and
they try to make it twist it around and
make it seem like a Samba today okay I
hate to put Milania in here because I
love the brand and I wanted to a
full-face Milani soon let me know if you
guys are interested in that so this is
the retouch in a race light lifting
concealer and here's the real tea
I actually like the formula here's the
problem there are no shades a light
enough for me literally it's like
identical to my skin tone or darker and
I'm
girl like every shade is literally
darker on me and I'm like what the
I cannot conceal and highlight with the
same color of my face this is
like the lightest one you guys it's
almost like yellow on me like it's just
not good but let me tell you this the
formula is really good okay cling finger
test it's really thick it's almost like
I mean it covers you guys through the
tattoo in my hand right covering the
lipstick it is beautiful I love the
finish I tried it even though it was a
little dark for me just to see what it
would look like on my skin and it
blended amazing for a drugstore
concealer I mean look at that tattoo
gone so the formula is great but Milani
if you're watching this bitch make some
lighter shade thank you alright last but
not least something that kind of flopped
for me is from the brand and NARS now
normally I like their stuff I love their
blushes but this one is the highlighting
palette okay first of all when I when I
try to wear highlight you know I expect
the lining I expect metallic and I know
not every brand is into that but NARS
I'm like okay NARS is going to bring the
heat you open it up right and I'm like
oh those look metallic those look
shimmery those look stunning then you go
to touch it girl first of all the
formula is not that bad it is silky it's
a little like powder it just feels a
little tacky to me and you look on your
finger and you're like oh damn and then
you swatch it on your hand and it's like
okay and I know I'm putting it over the
stain but once you blend it out it's
like kind of shimmery and I know I have
like Kylie stuff on my hands so I'm
gonna try to clean off my hand it's just
not blinding and it did not go on my
skin amazing it kind of fell flat like
here I'm still really going to take a
brush and when I was putting it on I
mean look this is the end of the video
guys so we're going to douse my face in
highlighter let's just put on my chin
right it has like this white cast of
like baby powder or like I don't know
look at that oh I just did not like how
it looked on my skin I hated it I was
like girl it's like white chalk like
it's literally I'm going to take this
and try to blend it out that looks rific
I just not like the formula and I really
was expecting like the line
and it kind of sailed for me so NARTH
not this time baby definitely not for me
but of course if you're someone that
likes a more subtle gloww you may like
this but for me it was like it's like it
was a mess all right you guys thank you
