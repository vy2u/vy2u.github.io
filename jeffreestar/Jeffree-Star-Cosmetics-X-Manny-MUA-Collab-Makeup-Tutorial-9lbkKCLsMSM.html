channel today I have a really exciting
tutorial because listen the many emulate
jeffree star cosmetics collaboration has
finally been revealed today it has been
so hard to keep it a secret from you
guys I know that me and Manny have been
to sneak peaking on Instagram the last
few weeks but we have been working on
this idea for months now it's so cool
and amazing to see it all comes of
rotation and come together now
the collaboration BAM looks a little
something like this and this is the
bundle box now the bundle comes at an
amazing discount for only 50 bucks you
get two of the lower liquid lipsticks
and one skin frost now me and many
created these shapes together he really
I mean I think he kind of stepped out of
his comfort zone a lot for this one
because we all know Manny loves his new
lipsticks but he definitely went a
little more for this one which I love
because he has done a lot of
collaborations in the past and I think
it was cool for him to do something a
little different so in today's tutorial
I will be using the highlighter and of
course of one of the liquid lips if you
have not seen the other color or seemly
full reveal you can watch that right now
on Manny's channel and everything will
be linked down below
now the collaboration will be out April
8th whoa which is only a few weeks away
I can't even believe it I'm like oh my
god it's approaching and of course also
everything inside of here it will be
sold individually so if you don't want
the bundle and you just want one
lipstick or you maybe just want the
highlighter you of course can get that
about something really exciting to share
with my UK and Europe customers and
subscribers me and Manny are doing a
little UK tour if you will where we're
going to do some mean greets we have a
pop-up store and we are doing Manchester
Liverpool and London so also everything
will be linked down below if you forget
or I need any reminders or any links but
I mean Manny cannot wait to see everyone
in the UK so I think it's time to dive
into this look so if you want to see how
I created this high-fashion military
green glam and keep on watching all
right guys let's dive into this tutorial
so today to prep the skin I'm going to
be using the new by Sally unicorn
essence serum oh my gosh
now I know a lot of you love to read
myself for using this expensive ass
primer in all my videos so if you kind
of want I'm not gonna say this is a dupe
but a similar aspect is definitely this
one and it is I think 60% cheaper and I
also use this on back for the I do my
boyfriend's brothers makeup tag and his
skin oh look two matched so we're going
to give this guy a little shape so I'm
just going to put some on my skin
crying cotton candy yeah if you ever
wondered what it looked like Korea being
a bukkake here is what I would be
looking like Q this looks really
interesting looks like a unicorn
gangbang alright now I'm going to take a
little synthetic brush and put this all
over you can also use your hands of
course but a lot of times with jewelry
and nails I don't like to get products
on my hands so thank God for brushes
all right my skin is feeling really nice
and almost like tacky which I love
because I already know that makeup is
going to melt on my skin so a let's get
the foundation the foundation we are
going to use to today we're going to use
a little drugstore on a little luxury
and kind of mix them together for a
little cocktail if you will so I'm first
going to go in with the Dior air flash
this has been one of my favorite
foundation for I think almost 5 years
now that's a long time because with
makeup I get over things or so much
product coming out always from so many
brands but this one well this one
probably the best foundation formula
that's ever tried so this doesn't have
to be perfect because you are going to
blend it out so just kind of like to get
a fine mist around my whole entire face
if you will and then we're going to go
in with the L'Oreal infallible Pro glow
foundation let's get to buffing
we can't win all right now for concealer
today we're going to be going in with
the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD concealer
this is the invisible cover now a few
people have done my makeup recently for
photoshoots and they've used this on me
and I felt like it was really
brightening and really snatched so let's
give this a whirl I don't want to put on
too much because I don't know the
coverage really for this because someone
else use this on me I'm on baby there we
go so I'm just going to do a little bit
and then we can always add more if we
need to come on here and get the bus
back all right now it's time to buff and
blend this out besides my Beauty Blender
I'm also going to be using the artiste
oval 7 brush for a little bit of
blending today so we're going to use
both of them all right no concealer is
so full coverage now I know I
don't normally use cream contours a lot
on my channel but I'm going to be going
in with the Laura Mercier what is this
one a flawless contouring palette I've
been using this for about a year now on
and off I love it and I'm going to go in
accord with a synthetic bristle brush so
it doesn't up my nice lens and I'm
going to go in with the shade contour
one and we're going to put a little on
my brush and I like to kind of sculpt
the contour out and we're going to stop
it there not do anything too low and
then do a little bit into the hairline
when you want to make your forehead
invisible use some heavy contouring all
right now it is time to blend this out
because we look a little baby right now
all right
contour is almost done now we're about
to set it with a little bronzer but
before that we got to make sure our
under eyes are not going to crease so
I'm going to be going in with the lemare
the powder because you know this shit's
bomb
alright now I'm going to take a clean
brush it can be any brush you want and
we're just going to brush away all that
loose powder now we're going to use the
new Tom Ford ultimate bronzer in shade
Terra Terra Terra
look how big this compact is Oh what's
up and draws a foul a what's up bitch
Hank right no but for real this new
bronzer though I use it the other day it
is everything so I am going to just kind
of go over that cream contour it's
almost like we're setting it so you
don't want it go really heavy you're
just going to be kind of really light
handed and just kind of brush it on all
right the space is set so now I'm going
to quickly do some eyebrows off-camera
and I'll be right back
alright for eyes today we're going to be
dipping through both of my palettes the
beauty killer and the androgyny palette
now today we're only going to be using
one shade in here is really just to kind
of set my entire eye for a nice ivory
base and of course we're going to be
using shade it's China white so I'm
going to take a little Mac 2 by 2 brush
I'm using me for 10 years I'm obsessed
with them and let's go into my eye
let's dip in juvey androgyny palette now
oh my god so I've been using this one
for a minute all the stars are getting
diminished so I'm going to be taking
this little Bobby Brown eye blender
brush and we are going to dip right into
safe word for the little transition
shade if you will so let's get on it I'm
going to make sure those lines are
really blended nicely I'm going to go in
with this morphe M 510 now normally I
use this to highlight what I love
dipping this into your China white and
just getting the brush coated in that
irate shadow and I'll just kind of go
over this just make sure it's really
blended out nice
now that safe board is all set and laid
it's time to move on to some greens so
I'm first going to start off by packing
the shade military which is this green
color right here all over the lid and
also in decrease so let's get to it
all right now we're going to dip into
military again and we're just going to
start smoking out the under eye so I'm
just going to take this little dome
brush to just kind of look up and start
blending now red liner today I'm going
to be using something I've actually
never used before this is from the brand
Marc Jacobs beauty and these are the
high liner matte gel I Kranz and this is
in shaded Asia blue now a lot I mean
it's such a pretty periwinkle color I've
seen many uses before and a few
tutorials and I was like oh okay bitch
your waterline is like smashed we are
going to try this bad boy out today now
these are supposed to last like a long
time and not smear or come off so let's
see what happen I mean hello pigment
holy it even got on my lashes which
is fine because we're going to do
mascara in a minute but like holy
the waterline is so like I'm taken aback
looks so pretty so now we're going to
dip into shade of poison it is a really
dark teal color and we're going to be
using this little Cosette brush and what
we're about to do is take this color and
do it under the waterline color so we're
just going to kind of go back and forth
really gently and darken that smoky eye
now we're going to use the same brush
and dip in to military or one more time
now we're going to lightly put that over
poison it just kind of buff it out so it
looks seamless and really dramatic all
right now let's add a little bit of
glitter and spice this look now I know I
have used these Stila liquid eyeshadows
a million times in my channel the last
few months and they're in my favourites
I am obsessed with them now this shade
and diamond dust almost gives you like a
holographic speck on the lid yes all my
whole of section was out there what it
is
now you guys tell me if it looks
holographic or not but I just think that
this coal litter though is everything
now you can use a synthetic brush if you
want us to going with the applicator and
I'll start going really really barely
any just kind of like to start and then
we're going to paint the entire lid and
I love this brush because it kind of
helps you carve out your lid where you
want to stop the glitter now the trick
with these you guys is to do it last for
your eyes so before lashes and mascara
put the glitter on you try to put the
glitter on too early and blend it out
with a brush it will kind of fall on
your cheeks so how'd it be the last
tougher for your eye alright of course
no shocker here I'm going to going with
my favorite benefit roller lash mascara
now if you weeks ago I tried another
mascara in a tutorial and didn't love it
so here we are
alright now to make sure there's no
liner on our lashes I'm going to try and
cover them all with of course the
mascara so let's see what happened
her last today I'm going to be going in
with the Lilly ghalichi lashes in style
and olara and I will be right back
alright now let's get to highlighting in
the lips of course I'm going to be using
the many mu8 jeffree star cosmetics
bundle box today yes in any box BAM you
get one skin frost and to a liquid lips
so of course if you want to see the full
reveal head on over to Manny's channel
it will be linked down below but today
I'm going to be using one lip and of
course the highlighter I got a babe in
that right now the
highlighter color is called Eclipse and
of course it comes in the many MUA matte
black packaging with his classic
hologram and when you open it up whoo
you get the crescent moon and the star
now I've been using this for the last
few weeks so I'm just going to just do a
little one-two-three and selectusa
highlighting now when manny and I were
creating the shade he was like look I
want something really like icy peachy
like just something so blinding that
will just you know steal your soul and
he created the shade in the lab with me
and I was like a set and I love how it
looks on his skin tone it just kind of
like transforms on everyone and I think
it looks so stunning and I'm just really
happy of just how this whole thing
turned out I'm like oh you guys know
this bitch is going to blind for filth
right now alright now we are going to
hit our Cupid's bow of course and we
want to hit the Cupid's bow I mean
Salette and of course last but not least
is the brow bone so I'm going to take
this little tomforde angle brush and
we're just going to take that and put it
right under the brow just so kind of
gives it a little added dimension and
flavor
all right now I closely want to start
when some blush so I'm going to be using
the Becca cosmetics flower child blush
this is in the Prosecco pop split I love
this color it is just really I don't
know you guys will see what I hit the
cheeks it's a really pretty and it's a
really pigmented so when it's on the
brush do a little tap because lower
Jesus for lips today of course you guys
know want to be using one of the many
MUA JSC collaboration velour liquid
lipsticks and I'm going to be going in
with shade daddy this is a really cool
toned 90s Brown I love it I think that
it is very many now I know he likes to
stick to his light nude shades but I
feel like this was just him that like
speaks to me I feel like I don't know
when I look at this color I like kind of
like manually wear that instantly and I
think that this will go really nice with
this cool tone it looks today so let's
put her on
you can't win if your lip is dry I think
it looks so beautiful with this look I'm
looking in the monitor like hi okay now
for it's time to set the same
announcement this is black packaging
I had to plug the new tatcha luminous
dewy skin mist in this limited edition
black packaging it is so beautiful and
of course you guys know we have to give
it a little shake and this is going to
make your skin even extra glowy so if
you're afraid of the globe put this down
and grab your normal setting spray but
if you're afraid of a glow how do you
get to my channel let's get our engines
already there we go
she's knew she needed because she needed
to get all worked up she had to get
little pumped alright let's set 2000
