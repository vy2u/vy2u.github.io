into a transformation so we're just
gonna grab all of our favorite products
what do you see when you see here a
bunch of horse shit I see possibility
okay good I love that all right now I'm
gonna come clean about something that
I've never talked about publicly because
I'm so insecure about it okay so first
of all you guys I actually stopped doing
everything like about five years ago
like no Botox and more facelifts on that
stuff because I realize I did not turn
into Jennifer Aniston which was the plan
you know so same I was like kicked rock
it didn't happen I in the year I think
it was 2000 or 2001 okay I got like a
facelift I sort of got a lot of stuff
done but they gave me a peel here for my
fine lines on my over my top lip and get
this it was one of the doctors from
botched so my joke is it's true though
allegedly I was botched by botched okay
Paul Nassif and his like a cold or
whatever was in the office they decided
to basically burn my lip and I caught my
milk mustache but besides the obvious
reasons it's one of the reasons I don't
ever like go anywhere without making
okay like I don't even work out what I
saw I used to be scared of coming on
YouTube with no makeup like I refuse to
do it I got asked for years please start
doing makeup and I was like no I'm not
gonna do it and then I finally realized
like who fucking cares me zooming out my
pores in 4k
I'm all good but a lot of people out
there do have insecurities about certain
things so I think it's great to talk
about them and just you know so we're
gonna give her a full coverage look
anyway but I have some insecurities to
why and we'll talk about them in this
video give me the full disc okay but
don't strike me I feel like when you see
this you might physically strike me this
is my actual makeup bag gays don't run
away from me please
I've been an advocate please I know how
the lgbts are gonna short on me for this
looks like an emoji this look I you know
how many well many people have given me
nice makeup bags but the zip like you
can see right through and I'm not a paid
spokesperson got next can we look do
rule is iconic Mac Studio Fix I've been
using this since I was 12 did you still
make it I'm serious pull everything
expanded the shade range oh I got it
know what lipstick you're wearing from
Mac halfway open it open it so what I do
is I put vaseline
inside there's jpp called the place Amy
there's a missing gay his soul just left
his body it's Colleen and then what I do
is then I put it in my bra if I know if
it won't fit in the clutch we're gonna
go take you guys I live for Urban Decay
so what's left ooh backtalk that's a
good one okay the fact we have a baby
Vaseline that's rhinestone what the okay
I was on the Tyra Banks daytime show
back in the day and she gave those away
to everyone in the audience and I said
can I have it and I've been refilling it
ever since this is genius
dazzled and I just keep refilling it Oh
Lola Lola
oh this is eyeshadow I think is it
lipstick okay we're gonna give you this
to start carrying this is gonna go over
here that was dripping with
condescension this coming right now
we're gonna give you a new makeup bag
before you leave because I'm offended by
your zip Locker I know you are getting
ready you're just the first gay gotta be
offended by Zach she's going home with a
new makeup bag today okay so when I was
a working makeup artist and did clients
all the time
I love to just feel their skin and ask
them a few questions so we already know
what Cathy's insecure about we her both
have some insecurities but we're gonna
do full coverage today oh your skin is
nice though it's like very young because
I'm obviously gray self-conscious about
rosacea and everything okay so I had
micro bleeding done twice let's talk
about that okay all right you like it
but it's sort of fade okay so I know
you're gonna tell me not to get them
tattooed but I have to tell you when
you're this hair I'm so tempted to go
fall-like but I know it's not gonna work
I know we're not there yet okay I have a
question doesn't micro bleeding her I've
never know they put lidocaine on and it
really doesn't hurt okay yeah Wow I'm
gonna use one of my favorite
moisturizers now fun fact
me and Kathy have both never drank
alcohol and I have 100 think we're full
of shit cuz we're crazy but are we
admitting this part oh we are
okay what so we want you really hydrated
and stunning so we're gonna go in with
this vitamin enriched face face you're
like great give it to me
now we have a brand new beauty but how
do I know it's not just it might be
that's exactly see that's what I'm
saying
the essence is really moisturizing
honestly exactly yes and it is a staple
in many of our diets alright so we're
gonna get miss Cathy fully hydrated
today okay cuz girl it's hot out I know
so we were talking about how both of us
don't drink and what age did he sort of
been what like voice in your head is for
me it was my whole almost my whole
family drink yeah so it's almost like as
a kid you almost feel it yes like do you
remember what was like to be the one kid
in your high school clique or whatever
and I was with obviously that didn't yes
everyone else like it is fun to be
either sobriety is underrated like it's
actually kind of fun to be the one sober
version then the next day you can tell
them shit they did even if they didn't
do it I would do that up my ass love it
you doing down here - Oh always people
forget to hydrate like I hydrate all the
way down to here okay so we are hydrated
how do you feel like feel a little soft
right mm-hmm
now just for an extra little quick
moisturizer we're going to use a little
covergirl at no I'm just kidding this is
this Chanel hydro beauty I'm sure
there's nothing I can take from my
collection the Vaseline okay
that's it now I'm gonna tell you I'm in
at school you okay because I'm giving
him my mother Maggie 98 years young um
she also has a Twitter account she may
or may not be aware of okay yes so my
mother wants me to share with you in the
world she feels that this collection is
too high and mighty okay she said tell
Jeffrey he's adorable but he's hiding my
teeth and she said why doesn't chef Reno
all he needs are three goddamn things a
Maybelline red lipstick which is also
blush Vaseline for moisturizer as well
as gloss and one black Maybelline pencil
for eyebrows and eyelids and you're done
that sounds like it's three products
that sounds like sounds like how you
stick it ready I'm just saying like in
high school now I heard you me like
lemare's that we do have a lot of the
mayor here well I like it because I have
to because barbra streisand likes it and
Mariah likes it in JLo so I feel like
it's my job as a game aunt I heard JLo
covers her entire body in it every night
I heard Barbra Streisand you covers her
whole body in just the under eye cream
which is like a thousand dollars that
not genius I'm jealous
and we're gonna use this little Gucci
brush we're not playing games today you
know and we're gonna put some
Goldschlager on you this is Grillin
primer has real flakes of gold in it
it's unreal and it really keeps the
makeup on all day like you could do
that's key back-to-back shows and your
foundation is not going anywhere it
seriously for me that's key because if
I'm sweating on stage the audience
thinks I'm nervous you know and you're
like girl I know you don't know about
that part but I talk about it I talk
about everything in the show you know it
is alright now we're gonna cover our
anxiety and fears with this presentation
takes honey yes I'm your fear I like you
fair I don't know what he's do yeah yeah
by the way the whole orange fake tan
thing didn't work for me no
we're gonna blend okay okay so we're
blending and buffing but yeah we mean
you've both been through obviously
different scenarios but a little similar
moments and people I think I also think
there's something about people that you
know follow you and stuff they like
outrageousness
and obviously my fans if I if I may
sound like a 5th or American Idol my
fans but on the other hand it's you you
you do it is fun aspirational to see
people that are doing stuff that's
unique and different so like yeah we're
easy targets but like we know what we're
doing like yes you know I'm a like I
didn't know the fallout for the Trump
photo would be so what would come from
Trump personally I had no idea what I
knew would cause some shit you know but
I never at that level
yeah even it's the one that is like just
a civilian I'll call myself that is an
onlooker to watch things unfold it's
scary well I'm just sayin like that's
why I keep talking about my age like
think about like I'm 57 if this was
happening to your mom or your aunt or
whatever like it just shouldn't this is
not the country over this stuff is
supposed to happen I know so and we've
come so far in certain areas and then
sometimes it gets back I know all right
now for concealer and baking we're gonna
use Cathy's old neighbor mr. Kim
k-beauty
the k'kaw Beauty now these concealers
are really good they're hydrating
they're amazing it was anti-aging
properties in them allegedly because I'm
not a scientist but see if they work of
science and I can verify that these are
neutronic yeah whatever that means all
right we're gonna go with shade albino
Nova same associate one did you ever
babysit her kids everyone tries you know
what yeah it was really really sweet so
um
during my entire Trump scandal add to
the comedy because it really was so
crazy it became funny okay next door
I was literally living next door to Kim
and Kanye which is genius which is just
like I just want you know when I bought
that house all cash
thank you BAM I just want you to know I
swear all right like an idiot I believed
TMZ and I actually thought they had
moved so I called Kris Jenner and I said
hey I'm really interested in this house
in its next door to where Kim and Kanye
used to live and I go what do you think
of like the neighborhood the block and
she goes well they still live there and
I'm like oh no like that's they're gonna
think I'm like single or female and then
she was really nice
well if you want to really buy it I'll
come check it out so she actually like
okay so there you go I'm very kind of
proud that I have been calling them
dirty whores for ten years and they
finally have come around and realized oh
she's just joking around like you're
just right right we're just seriously
alright we're gonna do a little under
there's so many products came you need
to slow it down so we have brightening
powder we have baking powder Kim just
wants us to bake issue like Toll House
cookies did she smoke weed he's gonna
answer that no she is very straight edge
although you know what on they did
there's two stories that I can tell you
about them number one Chris bought them
a rolls-royce golf cart and so I see yes
I see Kim driving on a little
north-south or whatever the compass the
little compass yeah and I see you're
driving around and she goes cuz I do I
do like that she lets me tease her like
I you seriously I'm like thank you and
she goes oh my god the worst mom ever
and I'm like not as bad as mine too
close where do they help you get a
rolls-royce golf car you psycho
and never heard of my mom got a I'm like
Chris Porsche I text the mom I'm not
Chris
for God's sake what's going on and
anyway sure enough about two weeks later
Randy and I are doing we I walk like
five to seven miles a day I'm like a
crazy Walker and so in the neighborhood
we see a tow truck and a tow truck dude
and Kanye and they're backing up because
the Rolls Royce golf cart broke down in
our neighborhood and they call the tow
truck mine no that's that's money to
burn that's money to burn
yeah so we're gonna do we're baking
right now we're gonna do a little all
over powder okay I'm gonna mix in with
yours because I've lived for a studio
thick and full scandal oh my goodness
okay now you're just saying how you
don't really know how to wash your
makeup brushes or how to well can I have
her dog dishwater liquid is good
actually is and then do you see the
whole stick in there or just do the
brush part like what's the secret down
to here okay and then only upside down
and never let them dry up because then
the water can get in there oh alright so
um how long does one submerge the brush
only in the cleaning solution um I do a
little like let's see it goes counter
heads one two three four five little
paper towel squeegee and you should be
good really
as a dry so you can used again see
that's why I'm going to tell you to use
a quick drying brush love ya
brush love it's really easy and it
cleans instantly vitamin A c and e
allegedly collagen I mean come on
really wait as long as you say allegedly
it's covered mm-hmm my favorite rules
all right can you explain what sex I'm
gonna talk about aging a lot okay so
what is it about as one gets older like
my freckles change like this would be
normal freckled kid and now it's some of
my freckles are gone and some of them
like clump together there's what is the
best way to deal rekkles going crazy and
what was in what century wait okay wait
wait company if you look at my my hands
some of the freckles there's like
different colors and just as you get
older they just something turn into age
spots but on my face like i have
freckles some tough places in the places
i don't the doctors will say chemical
peel you've done that before hmm but
have you done all the full thing no I
was too scared after they burn I know I
just let herself bare I what I do I
don't want you to hurt yourself yeah but
I've been told that too for like
discoloration or like I have a lot of
freckles I have moles removed but it's
just you know it's scary territory
mm-hmm alright now we're gonna do a
little light contouring how do you feel
what contouring I don't know how to do
it I'm confused by it and I feel that
when I do it on myself I look like I was
in a fire okay back draft JLo and Kim
didn't make contouring so popular and it
was every brand had a contour palette
two years ago it was nuts but now we're
all contouring and highlighting and
except not me today I look like a mole
rat that's highlighted and I live for it
this is no you don't Geoffrey you look
like a beautiful stunning 40 year old ah
yes I do
just put on the fucking contouring is
the baking process throughout or don't
wait wait don't you okay got it
so I baked your baby okay speaking of
baked on 420 what was the most decadent
thing you ate you mean like other girls
are just in general like I don't know if
you smoke or do edibles both if if it
makes you have the munchies as they said
yes what is your go-to oh my god I can't
believe I'm eating this go to oh that I
can't believe is so much talked about
where my stomach's like
I did a Taco Bell add one time and you
know they say that like after the
supposed to be professional spit it out
yeah couldn't issue everybody
I ate sixteen tacos I am not kidding i
did shakes cuz i was like and i thought
if i spit out the bucket I'll really bar
yeah
and so I ain't one spirit okay yeah
exactly I'm there with you and by the
end of the shoot I was like I looked
about pregnant but I swallow okay that's
what I like to tell the guys alright we
just popped to Plan B's we're ready to
roll
can we refer can be slightly refer to
what we're talking about yes okay so I
admitted that I have an obsession with
my 600-pound life in the show skin tight
on you'll see okay because I have a
little bit of vicarious dream that
minute I can and this year I came real
close okay
meaning can't work anymore not a
well-known person or however you want
identify me I can't wait to get to be
600 pounds yeah I want to eat all day I
want my I want to use my gunt
as a table what a wordsmith it's a it's
a dotnet cunt I had a moment I'm so glad
that I get the exclusive for that for
the future of your plan so see see this
crazy bullshit right here some people
yeah I don't want that no I
I need Kathy to get the full
highlighting experience so we're gonna
go in with my in 24 karat palate okay
we're going in the shade sarcophagus no
I know YouTube knows how to pronounce
okay this blinding hyeonyun and this is
from the King Tut Tutankhamun if you
will inspired collection exactly good
we're doing a little highlight Center
really lightly like almost you don't see
it but when the light hits you it's like
I'm gonna find my light trust me hmm
I've been trying my whole life who was
giving you the best lighting advice Oh
on it's a bit my video guy Christian
yeah
that's Kenny when we started doing this
but I had no idea what to expect and I
was like I don't know we pretty you
think I got everything it is lighting is
everything BRE flames ice it really is
different
can something because someone didn't
light you correctly you're like fuck
this Oh hold on I need a minute Randy
maybe you'd like to take that one I'm
known for you can even improve the
lighting or I leave okay
yes I'm a woman and I asserted myself so
then I have to humble myself and go oh
seven I'm really sorry guys cuz it's
like these guys know it's cool Moody and
I'm like no moody
you know that's for when you have the 14
year old yes and light Moody's awful the
joke was on Law &amp;amp; Order once yes okay
fuck about the lighting on that thing no
and I wanted to kill them because it's
such a good show but they're all about
the Moody and I'm just saying I'd love
to be on the show but it was not my most
glamorous appearance no okay so we're
gonna do eyebrows do I uh I browse okay
read a lot of forehead so okay
manufacture I'm okay like I want to try
something that you have in here no even
vanity mark ginger Ella I've never heard
of this before and I can't wait to try
it I guarantee you I probably someone
used it on a shoot yeah some here I used
it on a shoot and told me what to buy
and if I bought it well I'm gonna
definitely see if it works and catalyst
let's judge your pencil okay
Micro bleeding that's so cool yeah see
yours it shows up but it's not like but
you said your ass faded a little bit
right yeah I had it done twice I kind of
wish it had stayed more because I gotta
say when it was first done I really love
you love dad okay cuz that for that's a
big insecurity too for me to wake up
every day and basically my eyebrows have
turned gray
yeah and no matter how much I dye them
you know everything wash your face it
fades so I do enjoy having eyebrows and
with all this forehead I've decided to
basically double or triple my eyebrow
game I'd remember the first time you
have a problem makeup I know that's such
a random question um I do and I remember
you know going into like my mom's makeup
drawer and feeling very naughty yeah and
it was a mess like my mom was one of
those where like I said it was very
sparse because it was like a few
Maybelline things yeah but just like I
had watched my mom likes it on the tub
and watched her so many times so yeah I
remember putting makeup on and I
remember the real trouble I got in was
when I wanted to wear makeup to my
Catholics grade school Oh
oh yeah so that was a big big no-no and
it was an embarrassment to the family
name okay Bernadine cuz monday i walked
in in full makeup and I got a fall from
Sears &amp;amp; Roebuck but it wasn't even a
full wig so the front of my hair it was
like a mullet the front of my hair was
red and curly I always wanted long
straight brown hair okay and I walk into
Church and I'm like this and I'm like in
Forest Park Illinois and everyone my
mother is like what the Christ are you
doing in church with a goddamn wig on
from Sears for Christ's sake god damn it
it's Sunday for Christ's sake
I said mother uses the Lord's name in
vain and that I think I got grounded
alright you guys now we're gonna dive in
just some eyes we're gonna give you some
glamour if we're going to use the
androgyny palette to start today and
let's just dive into it now I love
primer use eye primer she's like what
the fuck is that I think I just use
foundation hey that works honestly one
concealer you know I live for this
little Mac painterly paint-pot
do they still have beard cover a lot of
people use it including including women
and it's like more of an orange type of
concealer that you lay down first then
put the because I use it because I have
a I'm divorced and I like an idiot my
only tattoo know is my wedding room I
could cover that in a second yeah so
that's what how I got laser
I've got laser like five times and it's
still there I'm lasered off half my arm
is brutal we're gonna go in with the
safe word I'm sure Kathy has a few of
those my safe word is ouch that's pretty
direct there's no ambiguity about it I
love that you said that you give the
kids business advice yeah a lot of
people don't talk about business they
just you know it's like the problem with
me in high school is they never taught
me how to like balance a checkbook how
to do business how to do your taxes and
you just got to learn the hard way and
then imagine having a parent who had
credit card debt when I was young and
didn't know anything about business how
do you teach your kid how to be an adult
if you can't even be one yourself yeah
well my philosophy is if you can't
afford to buy a cash you can't buy it
I'm I'm strict yes agreed I mean it so
just work three times harder and save
your pennies and then you can get the
stuff you want amen to that
well you know I get in trouble for
saying Debbie Lovato because a I
dictated it using Syrian to my phone on
Twitter okay and so the lavada 'xh
which i think is you know a little
strong for a fan army name
you're saying it's a little I heard the
love Audax are not into miss Cathy no
they're not into miss Cathy and they
didn't even like that I accidentally
called her Debbie which really was like
I know her name is Dennis yes but anyway
it wasn't an accident or just for
Fineman it was I said I'm using Siri so
I don't know what's gonna happen yeah
but I just thought that they got funny
at the debbie part everyone guy ever got
very upset okay and then when now
whenever I run into her she's still not
having my dad me shit I'm gonna I'm
texting her later and telling her to
stop it be like Debbie mrs. Caffey
totally kidding she's an old and lady
who makes jokes it doesn't mean to harm
people but just roll with it I'm gonna
have to tell her okay I think today
we're gonna do a little milk makeup so
this has CBD infused in here this is the
cush mascara but before my scare you're
doing for a little good or you stay at
yeah no I like the glitter so this is
really easy it's a little cool it's like
BAM okay here just a little Vangie
glitter for the kids okay no mascara
this is the thick brush look how big
this is and this is a brand new one so I
reviewed this very recently we use this
one we're gonna do a brand new one on
Cathy now that I have pinkeye or
anything but some of you bitches aren't
sanitary and you need to learn have you
ever had CBD on your lashes or is this
firm this is very futuristic for me this
is like being at NASA okay and also
maybe a little like a weed center in
Colorado at the same time yes I've been
to those all right if we're gonna do
with somebody I'm gonna make a bottom I
was a dream of mine usually usually I'm
the bottom but I want you to bottom
sure perfect I'm open to new things
mm-hmm same I guess no Kathy was just
telling me that she's been posting some
photos of this dude and I don't really
know what wise stormy Daniels a charity
Mike 11th avenatti look him up right now
I most of you will think he's hot and if
you don't there's something wrong for
you not him okay okay I actually don't
know what he looks like so we're gonna
have to oh okay up in a sec I want to
get your opinion I want to get your
rating so I do make a very well-known
liquid lipstick and I want to put on you
for the first time I'm very excited okay
look we're gonna grab a color what do
you I wish they could do a poll what
color do you guys want look is it
celebrity my over overdrawn yes so we
got you not full Pam Anderson but I'm
just saying okay
Kathy Anderson okay so we are going to
have a question what's your thoughts on
Courtney Love uh I'm in a squad with her
Oh see I didn't know this oh yeah I've
made a deal okay so Courtney Love and I
were in line last year at the Grammys
red carpet okay
and you know Lord was there and all the
girls and I turned to Courtney Love and
iconic African American model Beverly
Johnson you have to be on the cover of
Vogue yes and I turned I go girls it's
time for us to get a squad and the three
of us made a pact right there and I got
nobody that's gonna mess with me
Courtney Love and Beverly Johnson
nobody I love that so well no one really
cares or any articles about it I'm in a
squad okay well I love that because she
inspired the name of this lipstick
called the celebrity skin oh good one of
the best albums of all time I grew up
with Kurt and Courtney and that was like
my own stick so here we are years later
and the cool thing is random fans story
is that she was looking at hashtags for
her music I think and she had stumbled
across thousands of people tagging this
DM means she goes hi can you send me a
box of your best and I had a fucking
like moment of silent silent everyone
thank it's so hard to it be quiet
James Charles I never thought I'd be in
your mouth right now this is a joke okay
let's let that dry alright how does the
formula feel I love nervous I'm like no
no I love it because like I have a
little glossophobia okay because I was
telling him that as you get older
sometimes it can bleed up into your fine
lines and yet this one I can tell it's
feels like it's it's drying which means
it will stay but not too drying wet like
and it doesn't feel gummy or sticky or
weird I'm very glad you got me over my
crossbow I love that okay well we're
gonna send you home with maybe like 50
liquid lipstick liquid lipstick it's so
sad a lot what about the new Courtney no
goodbye hope you brought a big bag
alright so the only final step that we
do here on YouTube is setting spray well
to make sure it's all locked into place
doesn't matter if you are doing it
back-to-back show a bukkake or you're
just going to walk this will really seal
the deal I've done triple akaki the same
and that's right I need the good that's
always base thank you all right all
right close your eye and just take it
let's do
then another trick we live for is
pressing that setting spray into the sky
oh nice yep you're gonna lock in that
place and it is not going anywhere okay
so we have a love for prison
documentaries and this is the most
random thing I had no idea I'm obsessed
