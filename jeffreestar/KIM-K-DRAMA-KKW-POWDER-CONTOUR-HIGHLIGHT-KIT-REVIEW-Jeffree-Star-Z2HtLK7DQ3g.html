channel I literally just landed back
from Bora Bora I had a crazy week with
Nathan for his birthday and all my best
friends came with me it was magical we
will definitely be having a vlog on my
channel next week okay before we dive
into the drama I just quickly want to
mention that everyone has been dying to
know the release date I'm going to
exclusively start announcing on my
channel starting today that the many MUA
jeffree star cosmetics bundle is back
and if you haven't seen the packaging
here is the new or revamped one because
inside there will be a brand new
highlighter which we will reveal later
this week but the bundle and all the
items that are in here the new
highlighter the old highlighter eclipse
and both liquid lips will also be
available individually but if you want
the bundle will be $50 and it will be
launching September 9 so while I was
away the infamous k'kaw Beauty powder
contour and highlight kits launched and
the whole internet has been waiting for
my damn review so hi I'm right here last
week girl the internet and then media
they really are trying it so of course I
have to address it if I'm gonna review
this product last week I tweeted
something out right here and I said Kim
girl why does this powder look chalky
basically Kim K went on her snapchat and
she was watching her powders and I woke
up that morning and the Internet is so
funny like y'all are crazy
my whole Twitter feed was Geoffrey what
do you think about the powders oh my god
they look crazy they look insane widen
look so dry like the whole my whole feed
was nuts and everyone was like what do
you think about it and I'm like rubbing
asleep out of my eyes like what do I
think what is going on here so I go to
Kim's snapchat and I watch it all and
I'm like girl them powders like sounded
dry on her snap like they just like
looked a little chalky so of course my
tweet went a little crazy everywhere and
everyone started talking about even more
and then it turned into a circus you all
know I am very abrasive with my opinions
I'm always a very honest and I really
don't hold back but I'm just a very
honest person and when I see something
like that I'm like
but I also come from a very sarcastic
silly place and of course if you don't
know me personally or you haven't been
following me for a while
you don't know that that's kind of my
humor so I put up that picture which you
guys saw and then let me zoom in and
this was her on her arm so I screenshot
at her style and I put it up and I was
like oh my god think these looked a
little rough which the majority of the
internet agreed with me okay then all of
a sudden a few hours later I'm filming
I'm packing for my trip Kim goes on
snapchat and references me and guys
I see that my fans are totally hating on
someone like Jeffrey star for being you
know honest about my struggles because
of his remarks I'm learning like from
the best like from Mario like how to
Squatch properly so guys like and I see
you being so petty bringing up things in
his past where he you know was you know
negative but he's also apologized for
those things and I get it's a serious
deal if you say like racial things but I
do believe in people changing and people
that apologize I will give them the
benefit of the doubt and accept you know
that people change and move on and I
know better than anyone that I hate when
people bring up my past or mistakes that
I've made in the past so let him live
like I welcome honest you know
comments about my products and because
of it I'm just watching better now so so
everyone get off his ass and let's not
be so negative we're all in this
together there's room for all of us love
you Jeffrey the whole internet turn into
a bloodbath so I get texted by a lot of
people even my family like oh my god Kim
is defending you on her snapchat and
she's telling everyone to like stop
judging you for judging her like
swatches and I'm like what the
so basically Kim was actually owning up
to the fact that she really didn't know
how to swatch which I gotta say one
thing and I know a lot of you out there
were questioning her ability and
wondering why okay if you're gonna make
a makeup brand and show it off and make
products how the hell do you not know
how to swatch which is a great question
some moving past that Kim said that she
was not even mad that I called her out
and she knew that she's not great at
swatches and that she's still learning
and that she appreciated the feedback
now obviously if you know anything about
her she also has kind of a sarcastic
humor and if you've ever seen their TV
show she's down for some laughs so I got
on snapchat and I was like okay Kim like
thank you because I was just being
honest I wasn't trying to be evil I
wasn't trying to be shady but of course
her following is a hundred times bigger
than mine and her fans came for me so
hard for judging her swatches and of
course what do we do every time we have
a feud whether it's with Kylie with Kat
Von D you with Too Faced with everyone
that I've ever had drama with I'm always
down to expose some truth to you guys
because this beauty community is very
crazy and there's a lot of behind the
scenes stuff that the audience does not
get to be you know witness to or see and
I have definitely exposed a lot of
things and it makes people very angry so
every time that there is an online feud
or a fight we always have to reference
the same song-and-dance of comments that
made 12 years ago
you know Kim even went on her snapchat
and said hey I met Jeffrey with a clean
slate I don't judge him
the past is the past and she basically
said for everyone to get over it she
basically meant for everyone to get over
like harassing me like leave him alone
get off his back but a lot of people
took it for hey Kim you can't tell us to
get over what I said which you guys look
that we're beating this subject into a
dead horse I love everyone I don't give
a what anyone says whether it is Us
Weekly or TMZ or anyone that wants to
keep reusing the same 12 year old
subject you can't tell me I'm racist
bitch because I'm not and yes I said
some up things a long time ago
really every time that I get into a feud
we're just gonna keep referencing the
same thing you can't tell me I'm
something out not everybody so okay I
wake up the next morning and Kim went on
a whole snapchat rant about me and I
wake up the next morning to all of this
all these crazy news stories literally
hundreds of them I was shocked I looked
at my phone and I was like oh boy now I
know a lot of you are probably gonna be
like Jeffrey you love drama you're all
into that there's a difference between
drama and truth and integrity and I've
always been about giving you guys the
facts a hundred percent the facts you
know no one can buy me I don't give a
 who you are but I woke up to a lot
a lot of hate and craziness and there
was so much media attention on this
subject because of Kim I got thrown
under the bus a little bit now she did
reach out to me I do want to put that on
record because so many fake stories are
out there kim reached out to me the next
day we spoke on the phone we're all good
obviously I'm about to review her Park
because yes she did still send me her
makeup so there's a lot of news outlets
that are like Kim hates Jeffery and
retracted what she said in like I don't
even know what the I'm getting on a
airplane going on vacation and the whole
world is going nuts so when you deal
with someone at that volume of like fame
you are in the mix so I just want to say
one thing and then we can move on is
that thank you to everyone out there
that supports me that watches my videos
that has bought in my makeup brand that
has even just liked a picture and that
is just supported me and you know me you
know that whatever the media says it's
full of here's the thing that I
want
guys to really think about and digest
because the like media is very scary it
is all calculated they want to make
money off of people's misery off of
people's pain if there is a divorce if a
celebrity breaks up with someone else if
there is any sort of anything if there's
a DUI it is everywhere so what do I have
to deal with I have to deal with
everyone regurgitating the same song and
dance from these old high school videos
and people trying to make me seem like
I'm a certain way but no one ever wants
to talk about the positive and you know
I'm definitely on a you know different
path that I'm started for running my
mouth and making this intro so big but I
just want to let you guys know that
dramas drama but really take it with a
grain of salt and remember that these
people love making money off of this
stuff so you know you even saw it last
year from Kat Von D drama to now people
have used my name to get clicks people
have lied people have made crazy stories
about me that have literally never
happened
people have photoshopped tweets and
Instagram posts that I've never even
made sorry for that long rant but yeah
this has turned into a crazy circus but
I do want to note that if you are
someone that is on the fence about me or
you think that I'm all in it for the
drama I declined every single interview
from CNN to TMZ to the Daily Mail to the
New York Times to every single person
that emailed me and called and reached
out and wanted me to ship top cam around
my gums I'm good I was in Bora Bora
sucking dick and relaxing and drinking
Red Bull on the stand and enjoying time
with my best friends because I am NOT
into feeding into that garbage so moving
on if you want to write a story about me
to get clicks and make ad revenue and
make money off of me I can't stop you
but my following and the millions of
people out there watching are not stupid
so anyway if you want to see me review
these damn powders and get to the review
and then keep on watching alright so
this package you guys I feel like I'm
lifting weights it is heavy now I really
haven't seen that many reviews on this
yet I know that they just launched a few
days ago so everyone will probably
getting in the mail very shortly so I am
really excited to try these because
after the swatches bitch I was like
alright now this PR package is very
heavy you guys it stays with her whole
nude theme of course
my cell phone you see the huge mirror
which is nuts and of course it comes
with all three kits with three brushes
which is pretty cool so this is like
this is a nice package okay now let's
dive in so of course I am going to
review what I think would probably fit
my skintone which is the light kit this
is the brush now these retail for fifty
two dollars individually you get the kit
and a brush when you order it and I know
what's funny I'm gonna say something
real quickly is when I reviewed the
cream contour I liked the formula it
works for me I know a lot of my other
friends like Tati and Laura Lee they
liked it as well but so many people were
mad that I liked it and then when I read
her for not liking something it's even
crazier so with the internet you guys
you can't ever win you just gotta keep
doing you all right so this comes with
four shades of course and I'm sure you
guys have seen it all over the internet
by now so let's open her up and see what
you get for fifty two dollars
it does feel nice it is heavy now
immediately it reminded me of this guy
so I'm just gonna say it the same exact
measurements okay let me just open this
up here this is of course the Kylie wet
set if anyone ever wonders if the same
lab makes the product which is not a bad
thing I just want to put that out there
hootie-hoo there you go so these will
literally look like the identical
component except this one has a little
bit more of a gap here while the kylie
one is a little slimmer now when i say
that this same lab makes their products
that is not a negative my lab also makes
a bunch of other brands as well
obviously i'm not their only client so
if this product you guys has 0.26 ounces
in each pan which that is actually a lot
of product this feels heavy very heavy
actually as a very big mirror which i
love and of course you see other colors
here there are two highlights highlights
meaning metallic glows not to highlight
with like a flat matte powder so these
are metallic shimmers now these two i've
seen a lot of people judge the bronzers
online they're trying to say that this
one is like very orange yes it does look
on the more warm tone side and this is
very cool which i love because i am so
we will try it both today
maybe just on this cheek this on that
one and then of course we'll try the
highlights duh cuz I'm a highlighting
whore now there's not a lot of
instructions about the brush or anything
on the box but of course and that's what
the internet is for let's read what this
is exactly supposed to do so contour
shade sculpt and highlight with the KK
Beauty powder contour and highlight and
get the soft buildable powder formula
makes application easy and blends
effortlessly for a seamless look the
pressed powder quad features two mattes
ideal for sculpting the hollows for the
cheeks hairline nose and jaw line to
shimmer highlight shades for brightening
and adding glow to your of course
everything cheekbones keep a bow nose
corners of the eyes collarbones vagina
radiant shimmer everywhere layer the to
shimmer highlight shades for a more
intense glow okay so they want me to do
both on one use the angled brush to
apply and blend the contour and the
rounded brush for highlight so one of
the things come with the brush you guys
know Iowa from it because if you love
your own brushes why not use them so I
definitely have my own little three that
I use when I'm contouring now if I don't
like this brush I will go to this this
brush could be great now the first brush
we all know this one from the cream
contour it was alright this one did
blend out people were mad but I liked it
like it blended out I don't know what to
say this side was a definite flop now I
know that you can take these off and
interchange them so if you have one one
you can put this one on this and keep
this as you see they are the same thing
so I think it's only fair that we zoom
in on the pan and let's see what happens
when I touch it once because that's what
I do so let's see here okay look at one
hit alright so of course from hitting it
a few times there is definitely some
payoff on the brush of course as you see
right there is it even I don't know I
can't tell so I guess let's just put
this on the hollow of my cheek and see
what the hell is going to happen now I
always tap off my brush once OH
okay work now let's see what happens
now said that it's buildable which
obviously it's not like the craziest
pigment which I don't want anyway
because I don't want to have to blend
out just from doing a few little like
hits in there okay it's obviously
showing up on my skin let me do a little
bit more now the brush it does feel like
I'm gonna say semi soft like I feel soft
but on the skin I don't know if I like
how it's blending I mean it's you know
it's blending so now we have of course
this side which has nothing let's turn
and show this side now I heard a lot of
people complaining about this being way
too warm I'm not like I'm not mad at it
so let's just take it a little bit more
and let's see what happens and we can
even do our jaw
oh girl okay huh that showed a
girl okay I think the more I like dip in
it really held the pigment onto the
brush so I'm gonna take the opposite
side and just go over it of course this
has no product on it I love miss like it
better on my cheeks versus on my jaw it
almost looks a little more like Oh Lord
girl now of course let's do the forehead
a little bit now I would never use this
brush to do my forehead I think that
it's too like it's too thick which you
probably hardly ever hear me say out
loud again so I'm just gonna take this
morphe brush and just dab in two there
once all right let's see what happens
all right so it's looking subtle it's
not looking too crazy now I do want to
say one thing that I'm a little shocked
about like I was expecting this to look
really orange on me but obviously you
guys if you follow me on snapchat you
know I was just you know on an island in
Bora Bora in Sun all day and you know
I'm an anti-aging whore I hate being in
the Sun but there's a few times a year
when you just got to let your your body
live and my ass got tan my face got some
Sun that was jet skiing and swimming
with sharks and stingrays
so maybe I'm liking this because I
personally am a little more tan myself
but I'm not mad at this now my forehead
you guys looks a little patchy only
because this brush I mean it's hard to
get into the hairline I'm just gonna be
honest I think after my hair surgery I
feel like pigment does not stick right
by my hairline I don't know why I can do
everything in my power and unless I like
put it into my hair it looks able to the
patchy so I think it's only fair that we
try the very cool bronzer color on this
side and let's see how we feel you guys
I'm just gonna grab a clean brush from
the medium kit so we've already had
product on this one I don't want to
dirty it up so we will put that okay
alright so we're gonna take this you
guys on a clean brush and let's go into
the other bronzer and let's get some
product in there as you see she looks
like even more not pigmented but more
like fall out and a little dusty than
that side alright so this definitely is
a damn it's that cool ass bronzer so
let's see what it looks like on my skin
okay so let's just do a little
comparison so here is the more warm
contour on this side and then let's do a
little turn and here is the cool side
which one do you like better obviously
you guys want to sound off below but
they don't look too far off even though
obviously in the pan and I will swatch
them with my fingers in a second they
are two very different colors but on my
skin they're not like reading that far
off I don't mind this at all on camera
this one is definitely a little more my
like tone for the jaw but of course we
guys should do the nose as well
somebody's a little Charlotte Tilbury
brush now of course you guys I'm going
to use another brush and guess what you
know I had to have two for this so we
have the warm side over here and then
now we will dip in with a fresh brush
with the cool side
all right so I did the contour a little
harsh on my nose you can really see the
colors I don't even know which one I
prefer like this is a more warm side I'm
just diffusing it a little bit with the
powder brush and then here is the cool
side they're not that drastic on my face
which is kind of bizarre because they
are very different in the pan so before
we do the highlighters let me just take
these and I'm just going to do a little
finger swatching myself okay let's do it
on my hand so of course let's just do a
little BAM
obviously powder and I'm always amazing
back and forth like you know should we
ever care or trust finger swatches and
of course you don't use your fingers to
apply your beautifully airbrushed
eyeshadow or your contour so you know I
think that finger swatches are great for
showing colors for Instagram and
snapchat but at the end of the day
you're not gonna use your fingers to put
on the contour so yes Kim swatches were
very rough for her makeup artist Mario
shoutout to Mario hey girl
he came on her snap and showed her how
to swatch better and the pigment was
definitely way different when he kind of
went in way harder probably who knows if
she was touching and good enough or like
how but anyway looking at this they
don't look bad on my skin at all but
they are very two different colors and I
actually like both all right now let's
dive into these two highlighter shades
one of course is a very cool tone are
they blinding are they not I guess we
are about to see I will use both of the
highlighting sides of the brush to try
these out so let's just dip in and see
what the hell is going on here
I don't know how big many of these are
so I don't want to I don't want to douse
my whole head and highlighter well I do
but you know what I mean so we're just
gonna be a little careful here
oh I'm looking in the monitor like oh oh
right girl I mean you know she loves a
glow I love highlighters and the Sun
feels really soft which is kind of not
shocking just I didn't know it was gonna
be like that wow this is actually way
prettier than I thought it was going to
be and it definitely has some shine it
looks nice it's not like too
overwhelming which you know I do like
that as well okay so that is this color
by itself let's grab the other brush and
try this by itself and then we'll mix
and match oh this one even looks more
metallic just from touching it let's see
and definitely I'm wrong so this one to
me is way more like subtle
this one is more light okay so this side
is definitely not as blinding as this
side I'm actually not living for this
color by itself as you guys can see it
is not as reflective it's very subtle
which of course Kim is not into a
blinding highlight this is more my style
so if you are someone that is not into
that either you do have both options but
I think it's only fair that we take this
and put it on top of this and let's see
what we got
did that do much or do that not do that
much I mean I could kind of see it but
yeah I didn't tend to fight it for some
reason but it doesn't like us crazy over
here so I guess let's take this color
and put to put on top of this
okay cool so you guys see how they look
definitely loving this one a lot more
than that so I am going to take this
brush and just do the tip of my nose all
right I'm just gonna take this brush
real quickly and do a little inner
corner highlight of course
oh hello a lot of products picked up on
that brush now I already have a little
bit of color in there from something
else but I'm just gonna kind of tuck it
right over here there you go I had a
more of a golden tone this one is very
white okay in a corner I mean if you
really want to take an inner corner and
have a moment there you go now the other
side I'm just gonna take that brush and
see if it wants to work over here all
right you guys know I had no idea what
to expect of course when I saw them
finger swatches I was like girl okay I
gotta try this for myself and yes oddly
enough they blend amazing on the skin
you guys saw the bronzer shades they
blended really nice I think I even like
this site more maybe because I am a
little more you know more tan now this
one is still really pretty I love how
this looks as well I would honestly use
both of them I'm not mad at them at all
they worked good there was great
pigmentation now the highlighters I
really loved this one obviously you guys
saw me just use it it is very light I
almost wanted to go into the medium kit
and try that highlighter in the future
as well this one of course you guys just
saw me not really into it is definitely
more for the subtle person who is not
into a beacon of light on their cheek so
if you are that person you are going to
love this one this one is actually very
intense as you see here here here here
and here
no I'm not like hating this brush either
I felt like you know like I said I would
not personally use this day to day I
would go into what I know and love
because those are my tools and that's
what I get ready with but the brush I
like this one a lot more than this guy
bitch come on this did blend the contour
nicely I would have preferred my own
brushes I probably would have done it
quicker but it got the job done I'm not
you know I can't say it didn't work this
side of course put on the highlighter
very thick so if you're someone that
wants a little bit more subtlety you
know where it's gonna go in with our
little morphe 510 brush and keep it
really real here because this is a lot
easier I think that for highlighting
this is very big and some people
our faces like put Laura Lee's head next
to mine girl I look like a horse let's
get a round of applause because the
k'kaw beauty powder contour and
highlight kids are sour food I know a
lot of you were probably a little shaken
and shook by hearing that right now but
yeah they are all drama site if a
product works bitch a product works and
I think that's always what I'm gonna be
about I don't care if I'm dragged
through the mud I'm still gonna try this
 and I'm still gonna be honest with
you now do I think this is worth fifty
two dollars I don't know that's where it
go look to me you guys I know you're all
gonna bawl your eyes like bitch you
don't care and I really don't for me
personally I'm down to spend money on
makeup because it's my entire life and
world so I'm always gonna buy the
do I think everyone out there watching
should buy this in particular if you
already have your favorite contour
powders no obviously
fifty-two dollars is a lot for for
little shade you know you can get
something even cheaper from like lower
back at Ulta and there are three shades
and you know two mats and a shimmer and
it's obviously a little less costly
besides that I will definitely try out
the medium kit highlighter and I will
try this for a few weeks and you never
know it may've fallen to me using it a
lot I may never use it again only time
will tell
alright you guys thank you so much for
listening to me ramble and try this
stuff out and thank you for watching
another jeffree star approved review I
will see you guys on the next one mwah
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
