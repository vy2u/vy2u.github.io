channel now lift and bitch I just landed
from London the jetlag is sinking in but
I got this baggage in the mail of
something a little special and I was
like you know what let's pause the sleep
deprivation and let's get to work so as
you guys may have seen all over snapchat
and Twitter me and many were just in the
UK celebrating our collab it was such an
incredible amazing trip and I literally
got back like a few hours ago so when I
was unboxing all of my packages I button
and gotten I stumbled across the new Kim
kardashian-west
and Kylie cosmetics collaboration I know
you guys have seen this all over the
Internet
Kylie has been watching it and wearing
it so it's Kim all over snapchat and
Twitter so I saw it listen I don't know
ever viewed a lot of Kylie stuff on my
channel some of it's amazing some of it
is so so and you know me I'm always
going to give you my unfiltered so if
you want to see me talk about this
collection I'm going to do swatches I'm
going to review it I'm going to talk
about it then you might want to keep on
watching so basically for this set Kim
Kardashian created her own formula for
the Kylie cosmetics brand we all know
we've tried her liquid lips that are
long lasting we've tried to be velvet
liquid lipsticks and now we have a new
formula called the creme liquid lipstick
formula so basically this is supposed to
mimic Kim's signature nude look we all
know Kim wears nude lipsticks all the
time her makeup is a very iconic she
helped catapult you know highlight and
contour basically her and JLo were like
the forefront earth for the contour
craze that you see today so when I saw
this collection the packaging you guys
know I'm a magazine warned I really
loved it let's open her up I love that
everything is nude you know mac
cosmetics did a little nude collection a
year or two ago where all the components
were nude and I was like ah just looks
so classy and pretty now normally the
component that's what I like to call it
the bottle the lipstick itself if you
will is normally not frosted so giving
it the frost was with the new drips and
the cap and everything in the font I
think looks very classy I think the
bundle box itself looks cute now the
colors there there are some light news
that will say that obviously Kim
and Kylie are not my shade I am very
pale kim is obviously more darker she is
from Armenian descent and these news are
obviously going to look a little
different on her and I know that she
wears nudes all the time so but when I
first saw these I was like wow they're
very pretty but will they look good on
everybody I guess we are about to try
them out we're going to swatch them now
now you do get this bundle for $45 which
i think is a great retail price
considering each individual shade is
basically $11.25 which i think is very
fair
and you do get all of them together so
beside that you guys I know everyone
likes to talk about different weight of
everything these are zero point eleven
ounces each which that's pretty good for
a product it's not like oh my god it's
empty you get like ten for to that of
these so what I've heard and seen online
is basically like a normal lipstick of
course like a stick lipstick but
basically in a liquid form so this
formula is not supposed to be
long-lasting it is not supposed to be
kiss proof and it is not supposed to dry
down completely matte like matte like
her previous lip kit it is a completely
different formula so let's get that out
of the way and I think it is time to
swatch now the shade names I've seen so
many people have thoughts on them I'm
like pearls it's a lipstick name so from
here to here it is Kimberly Kim keke and
Kimmy now there's the most creative
names no but it's cute it's personal
it's her collaboration and those are all
her nicknames that her family and
friends call her I'm sure every day so I
think it is really cute say what you
want it's a fucking lipstick name
alright first shade we're going to
swatch is shade Kimberly now because
they are frosted I don't really want to
guess what the colors are just obviously
looks like a pale tan nude now you guys
know I like to see a caters a virgin
wand with the doe foot is small and cute
you guys know I'm all about fragrance
and well wait a minute there's literally
like no fragrance totally shit it's
almost non-existent which I kind of love
that because I am not always into
fragrances okay let's put this on and
see what happens
okay there is one application or one dip
as I like to call it now of course I
have slightly bigger lips than the
average hoe so it does take a little bit
more product for me to put on now I did
notice one thing that was kind of weird
when I was applying it straight on it
was a little streaky but and when I
flipped the DOE foot it felt like more
of it came off onto my mouth which is
kind of strange to me but hey it's on
all right here is one layer so far let
me really zoom in with my eyes and see
what is going on here almost like a
gloss to me like a colored gloss
almost like a lip stain or something
it's definitely pretty non sticky it is
a very like light weight which I love I
hate things that stick to your hair or
mouth or like when your lips get off
this one is a very smooth I will say
that I do want to dunk in and just kind
of do one more layer it isn't as full
coverage I mean it's cute I like it but
I think I wanna do a little bit more
just to see what it looks like on but it
really did cover everything it is a tiny
bit tricky but it does have like that
kind of gloss effect so that's kind of
what I was expecting but I'm gonna put
on a little bit more to me the second
layer didn't like do anything
mind-blowing I think it definitely looks
a little bit better and the color is
very pretty especially I think with my
really light warm makeup it definitely
is complementing it so a lot of people
are probably going to ask me like do
these come off easy now they are
supposed to be like a normal lipstick so
I'm just going to take a clean finger
and glide this oh yeah like all of it
came off really it says it's not
long-lasting so obviously that's exactly
what it means
all right let's swatch the next color
all right the next shade we are going to
try is called Kim and in the bottle it
almost looks like a peachy light mousse
I guess we will see in five a second
okay I will say this for some reason
this shade is a little bit more tricky
than the first one it's not like
horrible or anything it's just like I'm
having to apply a little bit more now I
will say this peachy colors are harder
to make I feel like with brands they're
always a little more streaky to me this
almost seems like like a like a gloss
lip color almost like the honest Askia
like glasses huh okay so this one is on
actual of the color is really pretty it
goes with my of course hair and my
little eye look I did the same thing as
the other one it is very lightweight I
think it's pretty doesn't like anything
on my mouth which I appreciate because I
do not want a heavy-ass lipstick on my
mouth all day
who the hell does let's try the third
one all right third shade we're going to
try is called Kiki and I don't even know
what this looks like it looks like
another like a pale nudish color a
little more on the peachy side versus
Kimberly which was the first one we
swatch so they're a little different
this one looks a lot more like a warm
rosy maybe I don't know I guess we're
going to see in a second now I will say
this
how many lip swatches have eyes out on
my channel normally it takes so long in
between swatches to like remove this
removes like a normal lipstick is very
easy so let's try Kiki I must say right
off the bat this shade is probably my
favorite so far out of the three is
actually more opaque than the first two
I don't know why that is with a formula
but this one on very easy I mean the
other ones are easy but this one was
like extra easy like I think more opaque
than the other two I mean you guys are
watching this you'll have to be the
judge and tell me but this went on like
really smooth I think it is really
pretty I love the warm tone nude is
stunning same thing consistency
everything is literally the same besides
the coverage in my opinion let's try the
fourth one the fourth shade is called
Kimmy it is a of course another nude
this one looks like I don't even know
what it looks like you guys they all
they kind of look similar obviously
they're not the same but when you put
them all next to each other they are
very similar but let's see what Kimmy
looks like on the mouth
did you think it is all right here is
Kimi on the list I definitely think that
it is the darkest color in the
collection it's a little more Corley
elicits Brown and snoot in here I'm not
crazy I mean you put it on and it's like
oh I had like a little more orange to it
which I don't mind I don't love the
color for me specifically with pink hair
pink everything it's cute not really my
cup of tea
all right now I know you guys are all
gonna ask me how long these lipsticks
actually last I know we did a finger
test but I thought why not do the kiss
test so today babe we are trying out the
new Kim cake highly liquid lipsticks
there's no like a more like stick
lipstick but in a just cream cream form
I guess yeah someone's kind of kiss you
wants to see how like quickly these come
off for everyone at home that's gonna be
asking em ah yeah huh you can wipe that
off I mean it's still kind of on my
mouth though this was a darker shade oh
yeah it's really up that top lip is
doomed let me try one more
okay sorry it comes off yeah so I guess
I can feel it on my mouth I feel like I
have lipstick on oh really what you do
yeah
alright thanks babe I think it's time to
give my final thought alright guys as
you saw the kiss test definitely removed
a lot of it so I layered the shade Kiki
over what was remaining so this is the
shade that you get I love that shade I
think Kiki is my favorite of before but
um okay so final thoughts are these are
normal lipsticks now I think fort lifted
$45 for all of them is literally 1125
per lipstick which i think is a very
fair for her brand and her price point I
do wish that they were available
individually and that everybody is going
to want all four of course and I do want
to say one thing I'm a little shocked
that now I get it they are nude as
lipsticks now there's always huge
debates on line what are they new
obviously there are a huge range of skin
tones and I don't necessarily think that
these are nudes for everybody I don't
think that medium to dark skin tones are
really going to be able to wear these or
look flattering you're definitely going
to have to use a darker lip liner if you
are more of the caramel skin or even
darker I don't see these being pulled
off by anyone that is I guess in that
range
I definitely think they should have
thrown in a few darker news or maybe
even extended the collection to maybe
like five six seven eight and I've done
in like eight news because I don't know
I just personally don't think these are
going to look flattering on every single
person I do think that they looked very
pretty now let's get to the formula now
the formula was it's pretty basic it's
something mind-blowing I definitely
think that for me I am a more
long-lasting type of bitch I do not want
something where I eat or drink and I
have to reapply but a lot of people
don't like long lasting they do not like
that matte feel they don't like having
to remove it at night and it takes extra
time so if you are somebody that is just
on the go you want to throw something on
I think that these are perfect I think
the price point is pretty easy if you
just want to try them out and see if
they're for you I think that this is a
good time because they're not you know
an expensive item if you don't want to
get all four I would say I'm sure
they're going to bring them back
after this launch you know how they do
that sometime and of course everyone
keeps talking about it this came with a
card that says I have a surprise coming
soon
which Kim wrote this by the way so I'm
sure they are going to add on to the
collection maybe Kim is going to do her
own makeup line that's honestly what I
think will so let's pray that Kim chose
her own brand because I bet on her own
it will be sickening so I'm gonna pray
for that Kim don't try mean you better
come up with your own fuckin line but
I'm excited about you guys I am going to
say that these are jeffree star approves
now notice how there's not a lot of
cheering and screaming I just don't
think that's a formula is that
mind-blowing I think it is very basic
I don't want there's nothing special
about the cloud I think the packaging
the names you're obviously paying for
Kim and Kylie's name the packaging like
I said in the intro was beautiful and I
love the aesthetics so if you're a
lipstick lover and a collector you
should definitely get these but if
you're not really impressed skip it and
move on to the next thing
okay while I was filming this you guys I
got no I did I did orders with my own
money Kim K's new lighters they are the
Kim og lighters we show middle fingers
about being slag don't get
age-restricted I might have to block
this but um these lighters are so cute
when talking about this song the Titanic
crying I live but I'm alright you guys
thank you so much for watching
mwah and I'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
