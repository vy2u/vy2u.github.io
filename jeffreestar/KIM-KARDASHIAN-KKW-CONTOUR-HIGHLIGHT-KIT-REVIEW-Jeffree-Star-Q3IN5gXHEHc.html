channel today I'm really excited because
we are going to be testing out the
brand-new k'kaw beauty contour and
highlighting kits and of course if
you're know what k'kaw is maybe you live
under a rock or maybe you just don't
ever turn on the TV but of course we are
going to be talking about the Kim
kardashian-west brand new makeup
products now I actually got to go to
Kim's house this week and go to the
launch party spend some time with her
talk about the product and see it all in
the works and it was really cool to just
have one-on-one time with her and
actually hang out and talk you know a
lot of you saw me on Kim's snapchat and
you were like oh if you haven't seen our
picture on Instagram I'm going to throw
it up on the screen right now we also
took some really cute pictures from a
photo booth and I'll also throw up some
other pictures of me and my friends from
the party so we're just going to flash
them on the screen it was such an
amazing event and I know that whenever I
talk about the Kardashians or Kylie on
my channel and it's always a little
controversial I don't know why well I do
but people are just so crazy at the end
of the day I'm such a big fan of people
who are entrepreneurs and the fact that
Kim has made such a huge brand and a
whole family I just think it's really
cool and whatever your personal feelings
are about someone who looks let's just
do a little fact check you never met any
of them you've only read the magazines
and seen what the news wants to tell you
you've watched a TV show maybe you've
heard some rumors if no one's ever met
somebody how can you really say anything
about them at the end of the day I have
had amazing experiences with Kim and her
mom and the family and I love what
they're doing so in this video today
it's going to be kind of like a get
ready with my face I am going to be
doing a primer foundation concealer and
that is what you do to prep your skin on
the k'kaw website before you do the
contour stick you guys it says start
with your favorite primer followed by
foundation and concealer so the product
before we even dive into all of this it
looks like this and of course at the
party you know they gave us everything
so it came in this cute little bag and
it came with all four of the kits let me
just take all of these out
it goes from light medium dark and deep
dark so I love that she is catering to
every skin tone
now everyone always has such crazy mixed
feelings about packaging I personally
think that this is cool I think every
single thing including my brand comes in
a unicorn it comes in a box we've seen
it all before
have we not we have I think that this is
a unique idea I love it it's giving me
Pat McGrath vibes and I live for her so
basically you've got to open this bad
boy up and voila I love it it's very
like medical and sterile and has a kind
of a cool vibe I love the feel of this
it looks really cool it's definitely
different and makes a statement
so in this kit which retails for of $48
you get a cream contour stick with it
which is double ended and you also get a
highlighting stick as well and it comes
with a dual ended brush so of course we
are going to test out everything in this
today but first I do want to prep my
skin before we dive in so if you want to
see me test this bad boy out then keep
on watching all right of course first we
are going to prime the skin and I'm
going to be a little bougie today
because we are talking about Kim K so we
are going to use a primer by by Terry
this is a very luxurious skin care and
makeup brand you want to see me review
this actually try it against a twelve
dollar primer so I will link that video
down below and I'm just going to apply
this with a damp Beauty Blender and I'm
going to dunk it in and I know it looks
like it's foundation but it's not
now we're going to go in with one of
Kim's favorite foundations this is
actually one of my favorites as well
I've been using this for a few years now
this is the of course dirt or money
alumina silk foundation I'm sure you
have seen a lot of beauty gurus use this
before it is one of the best and usually
and mix it but today we're going to go
for a more soft dewy look which is like
kind of Kim's neck kind of it is Kim's
signature look she does not wear full
crazy makeup all the time I love when
her face is very minimal and dewy and
it's just very contoured and chiseled
and like really fresh and just like
we're in summer baby let's fucking get
started so we are just going to of
course use the damp Beauty Blender and
get to buffing
all right the foundation looks really
pretty really dewy now I wanted to
barely a little bit of concealer just er
like really have that moment so I'm
going to go in today with the Make Up
For Ever Ultra HD concealer this one is
pretty smashed and I love how it looks
all right so I'm just going to take some
scissors to this or can you pull this
Kenny hmm I'm just gonna cut it because
that's what I would normally do in real
life oh now look mistaken there is a
little tear tab right there alright so
we're going to shake everything out so
here are the two sticks
I love the all-nude packaging you guys
know I'm all about cute little packaging
and I love how it's very monochromatic
just like when Kim collabed with Kylie
this kit also comes with of course the
dual ended brush and it comes in a
sealed plastic little moment now I got
to play with these at the party on my
hand of course I've never tried it on my
face I love this brush because it just
feels really soft it's like mmm it feels
really nice and of course this is the
sponge let's see what the Realty is
contour shade highlight and sculpt with
the cream contour and highlight sticks
the ultra creamy and buildable formula
makes application easy and blends for a
seamless look the dual ended contour
stick features two shades ideal for
sculpting hollows of the cheeks hairline
nose and jawline the dual ended
highlighter stick so I guess this has a
matte highlight for brightening without
shimmer and a shimmer highlight for a
more intense glow use the dual ended
blending brush and sponge applicator to
blend the formulas into the skin okay
cool so before I turn on the face let's
open these bitches up and let's see what
they look like this one is the contour
stick this is in shade light it looks
like this now I love this because in a
lot of the promo videos that Kim posted
on her Instagram she said that it's
really cool for even doing like under
the eye and in the hollows of the of
course cheeks but also in your crease or
your lid and obviously when this dries
it can look exactly like eyeshadow so it
just gives you kind of that overall
sculpted look and then we have a another
shade right here so I'll definitely play
with both of these today these are
really creamy and blendable now of
course we're about to test them on the
face but on the hand they just feel
really nice now I don't always scream
contour but when I do I
and they still really really like soft
so those are the two shades for the
light now let's open up the highlights
stick once again it comes with they said
a matte side which I'm going to assume
oh yeah that is definitely matte so
let's put that right here for you guys
to all see oh yeah work and then of
course the highlighting side which I
guess is supposed to have a glow who
will swatch that right here oh yeah that
has a glow girl that has a fuckin glow
it's a cream glow which I kind of like
and it's different so let's start with
the contour first I am going to take
this side which one should I do
okay I'm more of like this type of vibe
I'm very cool toned so let me put this
on my face and see what happens now
Kim's makeup artist Mario was their
shadow to Mario you are everything he
said that this is a very light buildable
formula obviously it's not supposed to
be drag queen makeup here so I'm just
going to take this and let's just see
what happens okay so I really like the
brush I was a little scared because a
lot of times and things come with a
brush I'm always like uh uh like you
know those eyeshadow palettes that has
the one brush and you're like girl but
this is a really nice and now the sponge
I obviously don't know how that works
yet so I'm just going to finish this
little moment Wow I like how soft this
is it's not too harsh it's not really
severe it's like kind of the perfect
amount also I do want to know you guys
of course when you buy something you
don't have to use the brush it comes
with you can of course use any brush you
want to blend out you can use a beauty
blender to blend it out not that it
needs it but you know we're all artists
and we love to use the tools that we
love to use so I think that's important
to note all right now of course we are
going to do the other side of the face
okay now we're going to do the nose and
I'm going to contour the nose like
really sharp if you want to have your
nostrils appear smaller add a little
darkness on them
it will definitely push that in and of
course I'm just doing this for fun I
like my nose but contouring is fine it
to make up now
let's of course do it wrong yes bitch
I'm already feeling chiseled to fill
right now you guys know mama has surgery
she wants out forehead extra snatched
already all right let's get to blending
all this out
okay just first lime you guys I just
went through the difference with my damp
at Beauty Blender I'm just going to take
this and just do this side of my jaw
okay cool so what I like about the brush
is that the Beauty Blender I mean
definitely soaked up a lot more product
which we all know that's the beauty
blenders do so I'd have to add more
product and more product to really get
the coverage that this brings you with
just the brush so if you're someone that
doesn't want to really waste a lot of
product you can definitely just stick to
the brush I know that they told me that
the formula was like sheer and it
definitely kind of has this sheer by but
it's definitely pigmented which is good
because you want obviously it just show
up I think next time I'll definitely
maybe even use a little less product
because it didn't need that much I'm a
little shook with that all right now
let's blend out this forehead all right
the face is sculpted this is really nice
so now we're going to dive into this guy
now the matte highlight I'd already put
concealer on but if you want to
highlight other areas it says that the
matte highlight can be used as concealer
eyelid primer and or color correction
depending on your skin tone finished by
blending the highlight with your sponge
oh okay well we can always just do a
little test and just kind of do it a
little I like doing highlight under my
contour sometimes to really add it like
you know add and define those cheekbones
like doing with such an opinion I'm
trying to try this on my lids why not
now our need you like to shade a lot of
the times and things say like they're
not light enough or like you all have
seen me reviewed concealers on my
channel and on my girl
that's not light enough
again I saw a video where people were
like blending this out with their finger
which you guys know I'm not into really
doing makeup with my fingers but a lot
of artists on set loved doing it but I
just want to know that like this formula
on this is already like really nice
come on blending okay let's take the
sponge I am going to wet it a little bit
with some six-plus all right let's take
this and I'm just going to press this
into the skin see you guys I'm not
really into hard sponges like this like
the texture it's like a little harder
than a Beauty Blender i personally would
just take like in our teeth brush or a
different brush like even like what is
the sky a little more py2 and i would
just go like that and blend it out in
one second I mean look how quick this
does it ready so I didn't really love
how this brush was blending it out I
think that it was just kind of making it
a little more difficult yeah I'm kind of
difficult then it should be so I'm just
going to go in with the Beauty Blender
and just buff that out before it dries
please don't dry under my eyes I'm going
to scream
alright now let's move on to and the
shimmer but the shimmer highlight it
says to apply it on the cheekbone brow
bone I don't have eyebrows Cupid's bow
kiss is a nose inner corner of the eyes
and any other areas where you want a
subtle shimmer the shimmer highlight can
also be used on the collarbone and
shoulders for an all-over glow okay girl
so let's do the cheekbones girl does she
have fucking cheekbones honey
we'll do the tip of the nose I know huh
girl so now I'm going to do the inner
corner because I love that that is even
on there like yes girl just a little
subtlety growl boom we're gonna skip
Cupid's bow already got lipstick on bhai
and then shoulder should we try a little
on Catwoman baby mm-hmm
mmm all right now I'm gonna take this
ooh oh that is pretty it's like hello
summer how are you all right
don't look at my booby now we are going
to blend this highlight out usually if
it's a cream I'm going to use a beauty
blender that of course it's on my body
oh my god I'm covering it wait a minute
all right let's blend this out
it definitely has like that subtle glow
moment now we all know Kim is not known
for her crazy metallic glow
she is definitely the contour Queen and
she's not a highlighting whore so I am
just going to say I'm not mad at how
subtle this is I know most of your line
girl I know you ain't
yeah I know you may all about that low
shimmer but I think it's subtle it's
pretty and for this look it's kind of
cool inner would see this without being
blended out it's really cute all right
you guys the highlight is on I actually
like it when it hits the light is a very
subtle it's very cute
my shoulders looking snatched I kind of
want to put some right here and all over
my body I kind of want to put it on my
labia so you can definitely do stuff
like that add more highlight all right
let me put my titties away and let me
give you guys my final thoughts all
right you guys so I just went downstairs
for a little bit I had some fruity
pebbles who's into fruity pebbles by the
way obsessed and I said my dogs when I
went outside for a little bit PS oh my
god it is so hot in California already
summer's here but anyway I came back
upstairs and I'm a little shocked that
nothing under my eye we can do a little
zoom in right now there's no creasing
like I haven't said it with anything yet
there's no setting powder and it feels
really nice it feels like I know I feel
healthy and I know that's kind of weird
to say but it just feels very like oh
I'm feeling natural maybe it's the hair
I don't know okay so my final thoughts
are this for $48 you get all three items
of course to contour colors to
highlighters and the brush
the only complaint I'm going to say that
I'm not a fan of was the sponge tip
applicator but at the end of the day I
have so many brushes and I know a lot of
you at home have your own brushes so you
wouldn't really even use this if you
were someone on the go that really needs
this this is not that great but good
this side is actually really good it
does not soak up any product it blended
out the contour very nice now the
formula I love it I really love this
formula for a cream contour and this
bitch has tried out a lot of creams I
really loved it it wasn't too heavy it
was too muddy it blended out really
pretty and it's just very natural I
can't believe I'm standing natural
that's a little scary to me the
highlighter of course the matte one was
more of like a concealer effect it did
work was not the biggest fan of it just
because you know while ago whoa coverage
concealer but if you're someone that
likes the more you know natural side of
things you are going to love it
I think the shimmer is pretty for
someone that doesn't love an extreme
glow and that's okay if you don't want
your cheeks to blind people and cause
car crashes and stick to the head to
this one so the more I'm looking at my
monitor I know you guys see me looking
always over here at the monitor I really
like the natural kind of shift of the
glow I think this is a very natural like
I want to put on sunglasses and go run
some errands and be on my knees it's
definitely that type of vibe so is the
k'kaw beauty Kim Kardashian contour and
highlighting kits Jeffers our group
insurance honking I really like the
formula you guys I'm glad that it is a
hit because of course I was a little
nervous and I also saw a sneak peeks of
them working on powder contour colors
and a bunch of other stuff so I feel
like Kendra all be giving us a lot of
shit this year and I can't wait to try
it
so thank you guys so much for watching
this review I hope you loved it and of
course I hope you guys got to see a
better look at the product engage your
own opinion of course makeup is makeup
we all have different experiences and
this is mine so thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you on the next
one mwah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
