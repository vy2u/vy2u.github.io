channel hi ru hi all right you guys
sodid day it is 4/20 happy holidays now
if you're someone that likes to
celebrate baby showers or birthdays or
Mother's Day that's great we'll do
another video for you later but today we
are celebrating our love for marijuana
the stoners are gonna be coming together
today to celebrate our love of cannabis
so today I thought you know what what
better way to celebrate than to test out
a new makeup product that is about to
hit the market literally today that is
the push mascara now I've been waiting
for the moment when the cosmetics world
would collide with the cannabis industry
now I know there are CBD lotions and
stuff like that on the market but it's
really cool that a brand that is so
mainstream and in Sephora to put
cannabis type of ingredients and their
products I was like oh okay so now I
know that there's gonna be a lot of
mis-education on this product which is
why I'm here today to educate because
I'm sure a lot of you were like is there
like marijuana in the mascara and your
eyes get high some people really do
think that so we're gonna talk about all
the myths today we're gonna try out this
product and we're gonna give the real
facts of what is actually in the
ingredient and what it is supposed to do
so if you were someone that just loves
makeup and you're not really into weed
girl I got three hundred more videos
right behind this one that you can watch
or you can of course just skip this if
you're not a cannabis girl like a lot of
us also quickly shoutout to everyone
that ordered the jeffree star cosmetics
pink grinders both sizes sold out in
literally seven minutes the other day my
wig was it was off it was snatched I
couldn't breathe but I'm really happy to
announce that actually today I am doing
a pre-order where if you go on my
website and pre-order the grinder you
will get it in a few weeks because I
wanted to make sure that everyone got
one so when my new shipment comes in
they'll all go out and everyone will get
a grinder so if you have not seen them
check out my website has a
special star chief scraper that has
never been done before that I wanted to
add my little magical touch on but
another blabbing if you want to see me
dive into this review and see what
happens to my eyes then keep on watching
so I am here in Alaska and I'm flying
home tonight so I can actually be in
California for 4/20 you know me and they
are not gonna be here we gotta go back
home and smoke the best shit no offense
to Alaska y'all have some amazing weed
but California has the best so I'm
really thankful because milk makeup
first of all before we even dive into
the product let's talk about everyone
can't handle how I say milk milk milk
milk milk melt makeup milk yeah everyone
said the difference like tomato and
tomato who the fuck cares but oh there's
a lot of comments in my last video
testing out expensive makeup I use the
milk makeup a watermelon serum and so
many of you were like you're saying M LK
I'm like who the fuck cares honey all
right now I never thought I would get a
PR package in Alaska but here we are and
I'm so thankful that milk was like you
know what Geoffrey you you are the one
on YouTube you are the beauty influencer
that blazes the hardest so we want you
to try this out and I was like thank you
so this is a PR bucket it is this tower
a three-tiered little tower and when you
open it up it comes out so it looks like
this and it is big you guys so it has
all the part info on it which we will
talk about in a second and when you lift
this up there are actually two of the
mask arrows I love it two is always
better than one alright so first of all
we're just gonna do a first impressions
so I'm gonna take out the first tear
right here now it does have the mascaras
let's pull one out alright
okay I know you girls Republic why are
you shocked this is head babe like I'm
looking at the site this feels like
Wolverines claws like shriek like this
feels heavy it feels like adamantium it
feels like like heavy titanium I don't
know what this actually is but they're
misspelled expensive went for our
mascara usually they feel cheap and
plastic about honey they're not playing
around alright so first of all the
packaging looks like this it is more up
on the simple side it looks like almost
like steel with the black font and all
the black text and it is just like a
paper weight I'm like boom alright so
they did give me two in here which is
awesome I will definitely have to share
it with a friend no this will be
available in Sephora calm on no makeup
calm and in Sephora stores now this
mascara will retail for $24 which is
actually a pretty good price for a
mascara very standard for their price
point now it says one hit for
high-volume unique heart-shaped fibers
lock onto lashes for a long lasting
volume length and curl okay we got to
open this up and see what the hell that
means
my first impression so when you open it
up oh wow okay so the bristles do look
like this we are gonna punch it in a
minute and really show you guys our
close-up but for now here's what it
looks like and now I gotta do that I
gotta do the the infamous Geoffrey start
a smell test one second mmm Wow
now obviously I'm sure a lot of you were
like I smell like weed no it does not
smell like a blend it does not smell
like OG Kush but it smells very like
nourishing and I know in my last video I
said that something smelled the
hydrating when I said that I meant that
it smelled very fresh obviously I know
something cannot smell how something
feels mmm smells very fresh actually
really like a sometimes mess cars are
very chemically and you're like I don't
want that near my eye this one actually
smells nice so let's get down to the
nitty-gritty when I saw this on trend
mood I was like Coach mascara
what is in there a lot of people are
gonna ask is it legal to ship everywhere
in the world in America is there actual
marijuana in there
can someone digest it and get high
there's a lot of myths I think about
this product I saw a lot of people
typing on the internet so let's talk
about a few facts here
this has conditioning CBD rich cannabis
oil that fuses fibers to your lashes for
thickness without fallout so a lot of
people do not know that the THC in
cannabis is what actually gets you
stoned or high and that gives you a
euphoric feeling a lot of people helps
with anxiety with pain there's a lot of
reasons why we all smoke marijuana
everyone is different I am NOT a doctor
and I will not speak for anyone else but
we all smoke for different reasons but
if you did not know this CBD in
marijuana is what really helps with pain
you'll find in lotions and a lot of
people love CBD oil is even dogs with
cancer or extreme injuries I've seen a
lot of owners give their dogs CBD
candies or oils and it really helps them
not be in pain so it's a really
beautiful thing I know that we all have
opinions on marijuana if you were
someone that is anti anything girl why
are you even watching this blog in
general that's what I want to know
besides that I'm really excited that a
brand is putting something kind of on
the forefront that a lot of people don't
know about
I just want to dive in and try this now
this says puff puff brush evenly coats
and lips lashes from root to tip for a
defined clump free effect
alright so besides the mascara I got to
talk about this because this is genius
in the PR package let me just I gotta
move this out the way alright so we got
the mascara now it says we're giving you
the goods and at first I was like what
do you mean I got the mascara then all
right I'm gonna hold this up so you see
there's another tier that you can take
out right here and this has a G pen a
USB charging cable a candle I'm gonna
assume that's marijuana I mean it has to
be right and then we have the famous
milk blotting
Wow this even says crusher mascara oh no
this is not lit lashes start here I
thought this was they're rolling papers
that me and Nate tested out which I will
link below oh these are matches honey so
you know a lot of times we'd smoker and
we kind of don't have lighters on us all
the time and we forget so we're always
asking for lighters so this is kind of a
genius idea I'm like okay all right you
guys we punched in a little bit closer
so you can actually see me apply this
really quickly I just got a tweet from
someone saying cush means whoo and
Albanian is that true that's kind of
Awesome
all right you guys so let's see what
happens now I wish I could be smoking
and blend this video with laganja but
youtube was like girl no more of that so
we're just gonna test makeup today just
comes with a 0.34 fluid ounces which is
pretty good now a lot of you oh this is
made in Italy as well that means okay
make it made in Italy is actually always
pretty bomb they have amazing factories
out there shed it's all my Italians hey
all right so let's see what this is
going to do so remember this is what the
brush looks like I think there's only
one shade black all right so let me move
this hair out of the way and of course I
have pretty much a lot of makeup on
except no mascara I did very method and
really nothing in my eyes so you guys
could really see what's going on here so
let's just compare one side to the other
I'm actually gonna go right here and try
this side all right you guys let's give
it a whirl
Wow the brush is big obviously we saw
that already but until it's like really
on your eye it's kind of like oh wow
okay
okay mascara I see you already well we
definitely know that it's working I'm
trying to get those little baby lashes
right in my eye all right so here is the
top mascara on this side done with a few
quotes versus this sign which is a basic
bitch now as you can see it is a very
lengthening like right off the bat I was
like oh wow okay this is actually like
pretty because sometimes you gotta
really dig in or it gets really clumpy I
was scared because the brush is really
fat that it would distribute kind of
weird but it looks really pretty now
let's do the bottoms anyone else make a
really dumb face when they're doing
their bottom mascara I think we all
can't help it it's like oh wow it's
getting the bottom ones like really
quick
now I haven't shooting a lot so my
bottom lashes are a little like so far
oh wow so far so good
all right so here is one eye completely
done versus the right side which has
nothing on at all what do you guys think
we'll do a little head turn alright so
first impressions I like it a lot so far
it definitely did the job right away now
if you were someone that wears makeup a
lot like I do you know any wear false
lashes five is out of the week your
normal lashes are gonna be a little
abuse and kind of fucked up so I
definitely have been going through that
but it still looks great which is
shocking because sometimes after wearing
lashes for so long I'll go in and I'm
like oh my lashes are really sad and
they just want to break so far so good I
definitely see a drastic difference
compared to this side so let me go do
this real quickly and let's see how it
looks
Hey almost done with this review with
the cush mascara what's a fourtwenty
okay look what's in the PR package you
look at this G like a micro G pen I have
no idea
tell me what that is G pen yeah and a
candle and oh wow yeah I'm like damn
they hooked it up yeah they really went
in okay I read what the sense or I don't
know what it's in there but there's a
deep in in there alright let me finish
up his bottom mascara or this that's
really pretty you guys know I'm a
mascara snob a mascara whore if you will
all right well that is both besides done
I'm really liking how it looks I would
definitely leave the house like this no
lashes and feel confident so Nate what
the hell is in that this is a CBD oil
okay so it's not marijuana so I can't
fly home with it legally thank God okay
would you like your inhaler what are you
oh yeah for sure yeah it's just like
smoking well you have back pain from a
snowboarding and you got your fingers
tattooed and your leg tattooed yesterday
yeah
so I think he definitely needs a hit all
right really quickly while this is
chilling and drying I do want to walk
around for a little bit and see if the
mascara smears where it gets weird but I
do want to read this because I didn't
know it was in the back of the thing it
says why cannabis ever since the
inception of milk makeup we wanted to
create a product that showcases the
amazing properties of CBD rich cannabis
oil because I'm sure a lot of you were
like is there really going to condition
your lashes is it gonna do anything or
is it all for show says when we started
talking about coming up with a fully
vegan mascara we knew we couldn't use
beeswax which is a binding component in
mascara formulas and they thought let's
do cannabis the cannabis oil it whips
the formula into a creamy texture that
allows for a smoother application on
lashes it's easier it's tug free removal
it's gonna condition it's vegan and it's
a major volume and healthier looking
lashes in one hit I kind of live for the
concept I love the concept and this
actually tastes really good does it yeah
I should try it okay let's give it a
whirl
this is CBD if anyone from YouTube is
watching this is not marijuana so if you
flag this fucking video girl I'm calling
you how do you hit it just suck on it
yeah tastes really good
hmm now I have asthma you guys so I
don't really chief like Chief Keef over
here but what he's good it does do it
yeah I've definitely had a microchip
panel and I lived in Michigan you did oh
yeah oh yeah didn't have a pink one
before oh maybe that was just in my head
yeah okay we're gonna go grab a lunch
really quickly and we will see how this
looks in an hour so see you guys in a
little bit not wearing a shirt so now
I'm taking my shirt off yeah all right
hi we're back
how doesn't my scar look did it smear is
look cakey did it get up here is it down
here Oh tell me everything I don't look
yet no I mean II like falling off all
out really no flakes feels really good
you know what the bazaar is like I feel
like I'm really talking this mascara up
like I'm sure a lot of people are home
or like it's a mascara relax but like
sometimes you can kind of like your
lashes feel a little heavier more life
you really know like damn this is a
thick mascara but like it looks thick
but it feels nice where's my mirror I'll
see you know actually it's really good
so you guys I'm gonna say it this
mascara is pretty good now I wasn't sure
really what to expect because it does
say that there's like little fibers in
there and I'm really not into yeah
unique heart-shaped fibers a lock onto
your lashes now usually mascaras have
fibers it looks really spidery or you
can actually see the fibers all over and
it's a mess this didn't do that no you
didn't look like a mess no at all but
before we hop on this plane and head
back to California and officially
celebrate we got to really give our
final thoughts so you know why I'm gonna
say it because I really like how this is
looking it's a very just like BAM it's a
good mascara it worked and I love this
story behind it if you're someone that
loves oh marijuana and you love the
cannabis industry I think this is a
perfect idea if you're someone that's
not really into it and you just want to
have a nice fluffy lashes then give this
a whirl honey but I am gonna say
officially the milk makeup cush mascara
Jeffrey star approved yay I love this
idea when we saw this online last week
we were like I was so sick it was just
really cool so we are living for this
product it looks beautiful on my eyes
and yeah it's time to say goodbye to
Alaska we're starting out the window
right now like one of you whatever you
alright you guys thank you so much for
watching this review have an amazing
4/20 I feel like we're gonna need a lot
of junk food that might happen and smoke
a lot of weed that's a given
alright you guys I love you so much we
will see you on the next one mine thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
