channel now today I have something
special for you guys this is highly
requested oh my god for the last few
weeks ever since these launch
I have heard Geoffrey when in the fuck
are you going to review the Kylie
cosmetics highlighters and I'm over here
like well I was waiting as well okay so
I'm just going to put it out there as
always you know me missus honesty over
here that Kylie's team always sends out
a PR package every time there is a new
collection whether it was the Valentine
the liquid list anything we always don't
want to say we I mean a lot of my fellow
youtubers like Manny and Jacqueline and
Nicki we always get the product sensuous
prior to a launch now here's the thing I
only review things that you guys want me
to review so am i dying every time to
get something in the mail absolutely not
no shade but on a real level if you guys
highly request something of course I'm
going to film it so the launch of the
acai liners was around the corner like a
week or two ago and cricket there was no
package so I was like what's up up and I
even tweeted at Kylie and I said hey
girl I can't wait to try your
highlighters and Shrove me back hope you
love them the fear of IVs never came
that wasn't just me
no one got them they were never sent out
of course they launched first time sold
out in five minutes I was like oh okay
girl I guess no one's going to go with
each other before they even come out so
then I was just in New York the past few
days and the second launch came out and
what happened they were sold out in 9
minutes but my friend and fellow
youtuber Jay kissa happened to buy them
right on the dot and she got them in the
mail and she graciously let me borrow
them to try them out because homegirl
missed the motherfuckin launch so I have
all of them here you guys I have all 6
shave just did lightly swatch these but
I've actually never tried them before so
I did my makeup today and I didn't do
any highlight obviously my face looks
bare as fuck but I actually just landed
from New York literally like a few hours
ago homegirl is jet-lagged but here I am
and today we are going to watch and try
out all six highlighters but before we
dive into B swatches I got to talk about
the packaging so we're
going to break it all down you guys
packaging prices formula smell you guys
know the drill with that so if you want
to see these four Watchmen you want to
see them on my face then keep on
watching so I do have all six here today
and I am going to show you guys be
packaging so here is a three out of six
now they are very monochromatic so the
local on the front is kind of hard to
read you kind of have to move it around
and as like a glossy the unit carton is
glossy but the text on the front is a
more matte finish so you do have to kind
of move it around just see it is kind of
hard to read on its down a real level
now we slip them over it is basically a
clear sticker with the information on it
alright so when you open them up you get
this little guy so it matches the
packaging now I will say this from
seeing them online and I saw the
cardboard component I was like oh my god
I wonder if it's going to feel really
light but it feels heavy like it feels
like a mild little brick like it's not a
flimsy type of thing it feels heavy
which of course I appreciate so when you
open it up oh it looks alike this there
is a mirror which is nice and of course
you get the typical drips on the pattern
just like all her previous packaging so
individually these are twenty two
dollars apiece which I think that's a
fair price point maybe I mean we're
going to see if they work right of
course but let me obviously she's not a
drugstore and she's not Chanel I think
she kind of falls in the middle of that
kind of high-end price point but not
extreme
so for $22 you let me let me just look
on the website for twenty dollars you
get zero point thirty four ounces which
is a nine point five zero grams for all
the people out there that like to know
the weight of everything now I always
guess like what it being smell like and
now I know when the peach palette came
out everyone was on an uproar because it
kind of smelled I guess chemically mine
didn't personally so a lot of people
like Jeffrey you're lying to us you're
just saying you loved it the palette
worked great for me as you guys saw on
camera a month ago but it looks small
crazy to me but let's put this one to
the test I mean honestly it doesn't
smell crazy to me there's like a faint
kind of like
chemical smell but I honestly feel like
it probably is like the packaging I mean
people forget that these pans are glued
in I don't give a fuck what brand it is
whether it's Tom Ford or wet-and-wild
everything is glued down so sometimes
there might be a fragrance that you are
not used to I don't really know I'm not
sure about this brand particularly but
it doesn't smell crazy to me now I'm
going to take my index finger and I am
going to go like this
oh okay so there's my finger now I don't
know if I was excited what I was
expecting but it almost feels like not
what it's like mmm it's not a wet
feeling but it is kind of like a creamy
feeling which I love I don't like chalky
highlighters I mean who does so this one
actually feels nice so far one thing
that I did notice that was a little
weird was when you look at the unit
carton you see the shade names are on
top this one is french vanilla and then
we have strawberry shortcake but then
when you get to the cotton candy cream
it's like a sticker was placed on top so
I'm not sure if they didn't finish the
packaging in time or what happened but I
remember Kylie snapchatting this in
particular entry said oh this is like a
lab sample or one that was made for me
to like take home but they're shipping
them out with the label fluid on the top
remember that's like i- it's just kind
of something interesting because the
rest of them are screen printed on the
unit carton but cotton candy cream was
not for whatever reason I have no idea
why I think it's only fair that we try a
few colors on my face today we'll try my
cheeks maybe below the brow and then I'm
going to do all six swatches on my hand
so let's dive into it all right so I
want to try out this shade called banana
split first it is literally like a pure
gold color I think it looks really
pretty in here now I'm going to use two
different brushes today I'm going to try
one side of my face with a packer brush
and then the other side of my face I was
you a fan brush so I guess let's dive in
so let's go in here of course is a clean
bro
we're going to put it around a few times
okay I see you on there now the pigment
on the brush is not insanely crazy but
let's see how it looks on the face I'm
just going to use a mirror that's right
here and let's give it a whirl
okay now the only reason why I'm pausing
is because you guys know I'm used to a
blinding highlight not that this was
advertised as the most blinding thing on
earth but it's a lot more sheer than I
think I expected let me put on a few
more layers of course that's only fair
and let's see what they look like okay
so second layer is definitely building
it's not like it's falling off or the
product is like coming off okay there we
go it's looking a little more pretty so
this is the third go-around with the
brush okay that is really pretty it's
not like one flight is the most blinding
thing on earth which of course some
people do not even want that but I am
quickly just for fun I'm going to go on
the website and read you guys what the
description that the product says
because I forgot to do that like I
usually do so this one said that this
CAI lighter single is your secret weapon
to create the perfect Kylie glow each
highlighter single comes with one front
illuminating powder of highlight that
can be used to recreate Kylie's favorite
looks or customize your own so it really
doesn't say it's supposed to be blinding
it just says the glow now I know that
Kylie herself is not the biggest
highlighting fan she does not want to be
dripping in metal why not so girl I
personally love that effect but as you
guys see in the camera it is blinding
it's pretty I definitely had to add a
few layers but that took like five
seconds so I don't think it's really a
negative thing that it wasn't like
metallic screaming in your face you know
what I mean so let's try another color
all right now I'm going to try a little
morphe fan brush with the shade
strawberry shortcake that is cute now I
don't know what color this is almost
like a champagne e like a pink color so
let's give her a whirl I'm just going to
go in with the brush over here get this
nice and coated and let's try this
cheekbone
okay this does sound like a faint
kind of like pink ish tone to it but
it's very pretty it's very champagne so
let me go in with a second layer now the
thing that I like about this you guys is
that it's not making my pores really
stick out because some highlighters oh
my god all of a sudden my pores are like
screaming in your face but looking in
the monitor and looking up close it's
pretty I think I already like this one a
lot more than this one for some reason
this one feels a little more I want to
say like reflective so let me put on a
third layer you know me I like so really
layer down this one is blinding it's
glowing of course this is now like three
layers on top so if you really want that
desired effect of like oh my god you can
see in these matters space you
definitely have to layer with these but
I really like this color I'm like okay
girl um alright let's try another one a
shade that everyone was dying for me to
try is the french vanilla highlighter
now this one that looks really pretty
it's almost like a yellowy white pale
color so I'm going to go in with a clean
and PACCAR brush and let's just kind of
hit my Cupid's bow maybe the tip of my
nose like let's just get that glowy look
going now let's hit the Cupid's bow this
one is definitely pretty I love how it's
like it's metallic is almost more
metallic than this one to be really
honest now I am gonna add a little bit
on my chin as well I mean this is a
highlighting video let's highlight our
damn face alright so I'm gonna use this
little angled synthetic brush and I'm
just going to go in here and go right
below the brow and see what kind of oh
wow okay damn with a little brush almost
made it looks way more opaque than when
I went in with the highlighting brush I
mean that brow is a lifted all of a
sudden good morning surgery
alright you guys I'm a little shook
because for some reason the highlighting
brush I mean they look beautiful in my
cheeks I'm not gonna lie but just shit
made it like the pigments show up a lot
stronger I'm kind of
whoa but um Wow okay so if we played
with these for a few minutes I think
it's only fair that we swatch all the
shades and then give you my final
thought
all right here is french vanilla and
here is a banana split
here is a salted caramel and here is
cotton candy cream here is a strawberry
shortcake
and then here is chocolate cherry BAM
all right so it's watching them on my
hand obviously you guys could see that
they were a little more sheer than
previous highlighter review videos like
maybe the Nicole Guerrero anastacio
palette when I squash those on my hands
they were blinding but of course I feel
like I'm going to keep repeating myself
if you do not want a crazy blinding look
then these are definitely for you but
just watch them on my hand some of them
were a little sheer than others you can
see that these two look a little more
blinding than the rest and then these
three to me look really similar so I
feel like they needs to be a little
maybe more color than the range I think
this one and this one are really unique
but these three are very similar alright
you guys so I was pleasantly surprised
with these I mean you guys know I expect
a really blinding highlighter I think my
only thing that is a negative for $22 I
expected like the formula to be like
unreal I think that when I use that
synthetic brush for under the brow bone
it showed up a lot more striking than on
my cheeks I had to definitely go in with
several layers and I think if you're
going to pay that amount of money for
something you really want to work right
away but let's rewind you know there are
you know drugstore highlighters like wet
and wild which are $4.99 that literally
have maybe even more pigment and they're
more blinding so if you are someone that
wants a little more subtlety I think
that these are perfect for you of
if you can wet the brush you can make
things more intense you saw it this
destrun to the brow which I definitely
will be using in the future videos but
all in all I think that they're cold or
didn't like blow my mind I think the
packaging is cute so I know this may
shock everyone but I'm really not going
to give this a approval or a Jeffrey
sorry disapproval this is really like
their cue I'm just going to use them and
you know I want to use them more I guess
what I'm trying to say I would love to
play around with them in future
tutorials and see if I'm really in love
with them but right now it's kind of
like mediocre in the middle I did not
fall in love or stick highlighters so of
course if you guys try them let me know
and sound off in the comments section
down below of what your favorite shade
was of course you saw the hand swatches
you saw they're based watches so let me

impressions video let me know what you
