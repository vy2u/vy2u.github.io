channel now today I'm going to be trying
out the new Coco collection by Kylie
cosmetics now this is a new
collaboration that Kylie just did with
her sister Chloe hi shad out to Chloe I
love you girl now Chloe basically
curated this collection with Kylie and
girl now I haven't tried on anything yet
I just got this in the mail and I'm like
you know what I'm gonna do it right on
camera so we can just keep it really
hood and really real as always now this
is $40 retail and let's open up the box
now I think for $40 you get three liquid
lips and one lip gloss so normally that
would retail for $66 if you were paying
the full price for each separate unit
which definitely is a deal and bitch who
doesn't love a deal right off the bat
y'all though y'all know I love packaging
and this gold this gold is everything I
love the accent it's almost like a
rhyming I would say almost rose gold II
kind of like it's a really cool unique
gold tone alright so I think um the only
thing there is to do people is swatch
all four of these and try out the
formula alright for the first one I'm
going to be using shade clothes now this
has the same kind of like licorice sweet
scent that they all have so nothing has
changed there and let's try out the
formula
all right this is on and dry listen I am
a nude lipstick lover and this shade is
so gorgeous I'm like it's stunning I
love this nude it is beautiful and
consistency wise it's great it feels
amazing it's not too dry little dry not
overly drying the formula dried down
fast it feels smooth and I'm kind of
living for it let's be honest the second
liquid to matte shade is open now
laganja estranja my baby girl
definitely coined that term so Chloe I
know you'd be watched a drag race bitch
alright let's give this shade a try oh
oh she's bright okay I did not know it
was gonna be this like bright neon in
the bottle but okay yes
all right listen I fuckin love this
shade it's like if strawberry and
watermelon had a baby I mean this is
what this'll go be it hmm feels really
nice I'm like loving this lip with this
look though maybe it's the eyes I don't
know what a bug but mmm
this one though mmm I love it
all right and the third matte liquid
lipstick are dashians you know Chloe
says Gorge a lot so I think that is a
cute little name this one looks like a
berry like reddish looks dark which I
love and we're in the fall season so
let's try it out huh oh okay
okay I'm getting some unicorn blood
vibes right away and I'm getting some on
associate vampires
work
so the only trouble I'm having which I
find a lot of the times with this brand
is that the really dark shades or the
darker ones tend to kind of be a little
more streaky than the others like the
colors looking great I'm just having to
kind of finesse it in there we go second
layer is definitely helping all right
now I think out of all three of the
liquid to mattes this is my least
favorite going on a little streaky um I
know you are definitely allowed to layer
a second layer but a lot of times with
liquid lips when you add a second layer
it's a little heavy a little crazy dry
so I'm just going to add one more layer
in the bottom and see what happens
now that definitely really darkened it
so I'm gonna let that dry and let's see
what it looks like all right now that
the second layer has dried definitely
feels way too heavy for me and it's like
a little huh this is a little little
heavy so I definitely think that this
one could have been a little bit more
pigmented but there is one more so let's
try the lipgloss now
okay removing shade gorge oh that was a
tricky one that was probably the hardest
one to remove from all her lip kits um
definitely stay in my mouth which I
don't mind because I wear makeup every
day and I could easily cover this but um
some people do not like a stained mouth
but um okay this lipgloss shade is
called Durham Jena and it looks like it
has shimmer or glitter in it which I
like same smell as the previous glosses
and ooh that glitter though okay let's
see how this looks on hmm oh oh my lord
this is really pretty
I love nude gloss and with that shimmer
though
hmm oh my god it is like liquid glass I
love it now anything that glistens glows
shimmers shines or anything like that
I'm gonna gravitate towards it now of
course if my mouth was not stained it
would probably look a little more
subdued but it is looking a little more
pinky and rosy because of the stain from
the previous lip color so I am just
going to see how this swatch is on my
hand right here oh there we go it is
definitely a gorgeous nude shade and I
love it because it's like almost
reflexive like pink glitter in there as
well yes it definitely gonna be wearing
this maybe with some sunglasses and no
makeup this is a cute little every day
on the glow on the glow oh my god my
brain is always a big Lou always on the
go everybody there we go but um okay now
that I've tried all four of these let's
give my final thoughts alright guys now
I know I just put the gloss on I love
the gloss now for all of the liquid to
matte shades let's break them down now
close was the nude one I loved that
color that is an easy everyday like girl
I'm just gonna go to the beach one that
is a really good go to nude color now
the bright pink berry one ochre it was
everything
I definitely want to do a little softer
Brown glitter I'd add that lip to it it
was oh it was amazing um now the third
one Gorge that was the only one that I
feel like was a little lackluster in
this collection now if you've ever tried
Kylie's lip kits you know that they
usually come with a liner which of
course this is all limited edition and
does not come with liners but I feel
like if you put a liner underneath Gorge
it would have definitely been a little
more opaque and probably not as streaky
but um I think that is the only con in
this little set the other three were
banging this retails for $40 is it worth
it I think it is Geoffrey star approved
um you know just because one shade
wasn't my favorite doesn't mean another
person isn't going to love it but I
think the other thing we're stunning
cannot wait to wear them in future looks
and overall I think it's definitely
worth the price so all right Kylie I see
you girl so in the comments down below I
want to know what your favorite color on
me was and if you are into Kylie
cosmetics doing collaborations do you
think this is a good idea do you think
it was awful I think was a pretty cool
idea now how do you think Kylie should
collab with next um I can't wait to find
out but um as always you guys thank you
for watching my unfiltered and
uncensored opinions I love you guys so
much and I'll see you on the next one
mwah bye guys oh good I can't do it I am
hi sorry
oh okra okra this is gonna be good
blooper it's fuckin fly man bitch open</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
