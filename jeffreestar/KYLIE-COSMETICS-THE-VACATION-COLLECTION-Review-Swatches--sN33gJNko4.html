channel today we're going to be diving
into the vacation edition collection
from Kylie cosmetics oh my god y'all
this is her biggest collection ever as a
brand Kylie cosmetics is coming really
hard this summer I know that there are
so many launches not to toot my own horn
you know I got a launch to y'all there
is everybody in the makeup world
flooding the market with summer stuff
and I'm really excited because that
means we get to turn up the glow we get
all brand-new stuff new packaging new
everything so today you guys it's gonna
be a long one so we better grab some
popcorn
I mean popcorn who watches YouTube and
eats popcorn what the am I even
talking about grab a Red Bull
grab some starbursts grab a hot meal and
we are going to dive into a lot of
swatches we're going to create a little
look from this craziness we got today
let me just hold this up you guys this
PR package oh my god look at how big
this is this is like I mean y'all was
she when she sends the vault bitch she
sends the damn vault in this box you get
a lot of stuff so I'm going to break
down the prices of everything as we of
course go through the video we're going
to watch a lot of stuff and we're just
gonna talk about everything that is in
here I know so many of you love when I
talk about stuff before they are
launching so of course I cut the
deadline really short for this one
alright so in this box you guys you get
matte liquid lipsticks you have pressed
powder highlighters you have oh my god
you guys there's her velvet liquid lips
there is super glitter glosses which is
a new formula I can't wait to try those
there is a brand new eyeshadow palette
there is a face duo there is loose
powder highlighters
oh my god I think I'm going to try the
highlighters first now there are several
types in this collection so something
that I wore the other day on snapchat
and online was something called the wet
set now this says on the back of the box
that it is a pressed powder highlighter
okay so let me open this up there are
four shades BAM and as you see I did try
this one the other day it's called
privacy please it was blinding so before
we even get into it I'm going to tell
you my first impression because I did
try this this is the only thing I've
tried in the box I was
look at the formula it is not a normal
pressed powder highlighter even though
it says it all in there it has a almost
like a cool to touch cream feeling let
me show you my clean finger here and let
me just dive into privacy please you see
one two one two
blinder oooh that's how I feel when I
saw this and I might as well just watch
the other ones for you this one is
unbothered oh my god I mean look at that
it's like mirrors on my finger and then
we have do-not-disturb which is this guy
look at that guy's all the tones are so
different we got champagne we got a
pinky one and we got a bronze one and
then the third one get away is the more
dark do bronze with like gold glitter oh
my god just feel so cool so here is all
four shades from the wet set and by the
way I love that name now I did see some
people on snapchat really like go in
here and press it hard like putty and
you can press it and see I don't want to
do it too hard because I don't want to
ruin it so as you see you guys you can
see my finger imprints so it is like a I
don't even know how to explain it it's
like literally a powder and a gel and a
cream all in one but it dries like this
and it's not like tacky a lot of the
times you guys just see me on my channel
use cream highlighters and it just has
that weird tacky feeling and you have to
set it this is not the case
this just looks stunning now here's my
only issue is that this for four shades
is $62 I'm my girl
Kylie's trying to use them luxury prices
all decided another formula is probably
a little more expensive that is just my
guess I do not know that for a fact and
you know she isn't that middle tier
price point but 62 dollars for four
shades I was like for the entire bundle
of stuff that I just showed you you can
get everything for $250 of course if
you're a makeup collector or an addict
you are going to love that price it is
discounted if you only want a few things
from a collection obviously I understand
that $250 is a lot of money for a
collection everything comes in the
bundle except the wet set so just want
to put that out there I know a lot of
you are going to be wondering and asking
so before we move on I think it's only
fair that we swatch with you on my
cheeks because girl I'm kind of obsessed
are you guys so I'm going to take this
little highlighting brush from heaven
'upon I
I'm going to go in with privacy please
ignore my of course fingermark and all
I'm going to do is go like that like BAM
so let me just put it right on the line
of my cup contour well I mean um what is
once the other day and now is my second
time using it and let me just say the
catchphrase at me and Manny made famous
I sure I'm really shook look at that I
mean look at that girl now I am gonna go
in with Do Not Disturb which is a more
pink champagne like color same brush now
that the color is off right so I just
put my hair behind my ears to see you
guys can visually see a little bit more
don't hate a knife Sephora clip y'all
let's see what it looks like oh I'm like
feeling the burn honey I don't want to
sound like a broken record you guys but
I really really love this formula I know
I said the price point was a little
crazy but I think for how blinding they
look right away I would definitely buy
this myself damn that is beautiful huh
alright the next item I really had been
dying to try out is they take me on
vacation I shadow palette this is it's
different
I heard allegedly Kylie did talk about
on snapchat that this is her best
collection today she said thank you for
dealing with a lot of my trial and
errors I've really perfected this and
I'm very proud of this collection and
this is my proudest collection I guess
since she started her brand which I love
that she is open to improving and she
has acknowledged I think that it's so
cool so here is the palette those shades
though yo those shades so for $52 you
get 16 shades and of course they look
like this so I have primed my lids
off-camera with the Mac painterly
paint-pot of course I do that every
video i prime eyelid so it's only fair
that we do it before we try out a
palette so I'm going to take shade first
class it is a pale matte lavender and
I'm going to put that all over my lid
here and let's see what it looks like
okay so right off the bat you guys this
formula is amazing
I definitely think they are a little bit
a more easier to blend in the previous
palette I think my only issue with the
Kylie cosmetics shadows has been the
metallics in the past have been a little
underwhelming and definitely I've seen
improvements so of course we're going to
try it
we got try at that blue y'all I want to
smoke out my lashline so now I'm going
to go in with this matte to have a slate
gray color called on the rocks or just
gonna use a little Mac blending brush
and put that right in my crease and
blend out alright now we're going to
take this matte chocolate brown shade
called palm tree and we are going to put
a little bit in the crease and just
darken it a hair alright now if you've
been watching my channel for a while you
know that I'd love to take really light
shades and put them on the brow bone I'm
a little scared to try this this is
called a loja it's like a peachy matte
shade and what I mean scared I just mean
that I am very fair so I don't want it
to look too crazy on my lid so I'm going
to take a clean brush and we're going to
play with it we'll try half the eye or
in case it's too dark
all right you guys Aloha is tucked in
there I kind of love these two color
combos together I'm living so far so we
are going to dip into shade island girl
which is of course this stunning
electric blue color I'm going to use a
Tom Ford a little pencil brush and we're
just going to coat the brush I did see
Kylie on snapchat wet the brush for some
of the metallic we can definitely try
that on my channel but I want to coat
the brush completely before I wet it
just to see how it works on its own the
brush is coated let's see if it works
all right now you guys know I'm the
realest bitch on YouTube Kylie I love
you this blue one
it's a litter and by shear I mean it's
sheer honey
its sheer not a bad thing some people do
like a soft look but if you're going to
do a blue shadow bitch you better do a
damn blue shadow okay let me just wet my
brush let's take this back in the
palette and let's close the brush while
it's damned okay
and now let's see what happens
I'll write you guys I will say that once
I wet the brush with six-plus it applied
really nice I think by itself it was a
little subtle so if you're someone that
doesn't want an intense crazy blue look
can definitely use it dry but I think it
definitely needed the fix plus alright
now for a little inner corner action I
want to use a soft champagne peachy
color this one's called a summer 17 or
right here and let's just pop this right
in here it definitely goes well with the
blue but to me I want a little bit more
intensity so we're gonna wet the brush
again oh girl there we go so wetting the
brush with the metallics definitely is a
big help you guys know if I was like
mm-hmm I would tell y'all but I mean it
is very common nowadays for the world to
own a setting spray and to bump up you
know the pigment as you guys can see
she's blinding definitely was amazing
after I wet the brush so T no shade I
think the metallics definitely do need a
little bit of moisture to really take it
there but that was announced on social
media so there's no games here now I
have used five shades in the palette so
far I am loving the formula of course I
think all the masks are going to feel
the same same with the shimmers or the
metallics so I am going to quickly put
on some black eyeliner in my waterline
and some mascara and I'll be right back
alright you guys I quickly put on some
roller lash from benefit on the lashes
and I'm loving it now normally I would
use false lashes but I think it's summer
let's just keep it a little more subtle
and cute let's move on to lips but of
course let me give you my full on first
impressions thoughts I think that the
matte shades in this palette were
amazing they blended beautifully just
like every other brand that I love and
respect so shout out to Kylie I think
the formula is great
alright let's move on to the matte
liquid lips and now here we have the
send me more nudes collection so for $45
you get four shades and they look like
this I love the camel nude gold
packaging I think it is stunning
now from left to right we have naked we
have birthday suit and I
let's just talk about the elephant in
the room I also have a lipstick called
birthday suit from my collection I know
the internet was going crazy at the end
of the day it's a shade name and we all
make these things in advance so it's a
coincidence anyway we have so we have
naked we have birthday suit we have
commando and we have their I am going to
swatch one of them on my lips and put
one of the glosses over it and then I'll
swatch the other three on my hand just
so you guys can see what they look like
and I was going to take the first one
called naked I haven't a fan of the
matte formula same wand same type of
like candy licorice scent let's see how
it goes on
all right you guys here is the shade
naked swatched
I think it is really gorgeous it is very
consistent with the past formulas all
her news are always bomb I do want to
swatch them all in my hand for you guys
so I will swatch this one one more time
my hand is so glittery today so we have
naked right there and here we have
birthday suit which is a looks like it's
a little darker nude than the one that I
just swatch on my mouth oh yeah
definitely can tell on the monitor it is
a more caramel nude and now we have
commando which is an even darker nude
and now we have the shade bear oh girl I
love that one I'm not to try that in a
video later so here are all of the four
matte liquid lips
there's also one other liquid to matte
lip kit in the vacation collection that
this shade is called junebug now the
internet was once again going crazy now
normally in reviews you guys I never
talk about myself or my own brand you
know I'm not about that life but when
the internet saw the shade it looks like
this they were going crazy saying that
it looked like my shade coming out
called you better work so when you see
them together you guys hers is
definitely more neon and bright I did a
swatch comparison on snapchat let me
insert that right here and as you guys
can see mine is a more deeper darker
violet purple and hers is a more hot
neon purple so there is definitely
different no install anyone's ideas
relax take a breather take a hit girl
let's move on so there are two glosses
with a different formula and the box
looks like this these are the super
glitter glosses there are two shades we
have a glamour and we have glitz
I definitely want to put one over this
lip here and if you hold them up I mean
you can see they're blinding in here
they look very glittery on snapchat and
online I was like oh my lord girl I'm
just going to put it right on top of
this
now at first I thought I was going to
hate the little brush you guys see it is
very little right here it lets you get
right on the edge and define it really
quickly I'm like looking in the mirror
like whoa so I think it's only fair that
we do a little swatch of course this is
glitz one more time on the hand as you
can see it is a very very pigmented and
glossy and then the next one we have is
glamour which of course I said it was a
more Goldy bronze color and let's just
put that right next to that one oh yeah
that one's really pretty Wow
all right so there are both of the super
glitter glasses alright and because my
cheekbones are already glowing for the
gauze I needed a chic model
hi baby hi baby so today David is going
to help me model a few other of the
highlighters from the vacation
collection so today babe we are going to
try the ultra glow loose powder
highlights these highlighters are
supposed to be blinding I mean we're
think about my cheek I mean it's pretty
it's pretty blinding that's a
wild on what do think about a lip kind
of sit yeah it's pretty it's crazy it's
got like a little of luminescence of
pink it's pretty crazy
cool so today we're going to try out two
shades of the ultra glow powders
today we have Santorini and we have Fiji
all right so let's try Santorini first
and you open them up and they look like
this so I have this little brush here
I'm just gonna lightly dip in there
alright cool don't move oh holy
we were head a little bit my blinding
well okay let me let me get more this is
blinding okay yes Santa ruder now let's
try Fiji with a clean brush
we'll use this little Anastasio on and
less oh oh my god you can't hold on let
me try let me turn you this way over
there you go right there oh yeah baby
right there I like it it's more
like flush sheet because I just like it
matches your skin tone more so it's
definitely blending in yeah
my hands kind of like I've definitely
been getting some Sun lately so you know
I like it it's cute I think the other
one turned to me is almost a little bit
more blinding but this one matches
Nathan skin tone perfectly so Fiji is
more like you bronzed the softer glow if
you want to call it soft but um wow
these are really pretty and there is a
third one we are out of cheek bones
today but we are what is called Tahiti
oh that's me been there yes I have under
my nose I mean it so let's do it
give a little whirl right here here
we'll do an extreme nose highlight it's
definitely more subtle and I don't mind
it I will just Dallas triple nose in it
people can greet us later oh my god
okay I mean that is blinding you guys
look at his nose it looks a little looks
wedge thanks babe yeah of course
okay so also in this bundle you guys
there are velvet liquid lips which are
the formula that she created that are
not kiss proof that dry down and they're
actually the identical shades to the
liquid to matte so I don't really think
we need to swatch them you guys saw them
earlier on my hand these two just don't
dry down besides that there is something
called a face duo I guess we should open
that up before we before we leave
everyone oh okay so it's a highlighter
and ruther all right kela so blow up oh
okay so glow up is like a blinding
metallic no it's good and then of course
Sunkist is a bronzer and it looks like
that swatch brand mm-hmm cute so you
guys that is the entire vacation
collection from Kylie cosmetics I think
I'm just gonna do a quick little recap
to my favorite items to the entire
collection are the wet set highlighter
which is on my cheekbone
oh yeah just feels don't dig in hard
well but feel it it's a go it's weird
Oh what does that feel like to you like
butter like yeah it's good huh and also
the eyeshadow palette worked amazing and
glitter the superglue glosses were like
