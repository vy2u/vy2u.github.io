channel now today we're gonna do a
battle of the metallic liquid lipsticks
now I'm sure a lot of you saw the title
and you were like ooh bitch you go and
try it Before we jump into all this
first of all we are going to do a test
of the metallic lip so today what do I
have I have that new color pop 4 little
bundle this comes with four shades they
are all metallic ooh there's a little
sneak peak and then I also picked up two
of the new kylie medals
now this one is que majesty and this one
is err
hei R and we got some Milani which I
have tried one of these before so I got
a bunch of colors and I want to see how
they compare to some of the other brands
before we dive into all the swatches and
comparisons and all the information I am
gonna start out with a little backstory
I know a lot of you were gonna see the
Kylie stuff and like oh girl let me just
fill the T really quickly and just dive
into it about a month ago I'm sure I was
most of you obscene I went on snapchat
and I did a little unboxing and I got
the kylie glosses not the liquid lips
disclaimer in case you really don't know
the full story I tried the lip glosses a
live on snapchat and the wands were
really fucked up like when I pulled it
out it was like king it looked like my
dog had chewed on it and put it back and
didn't tell me I was very freaked out
about it on snapchat and I ended up
throwing them in the trash now this
video is not a bashing video there is no
bullying going on this is just the
honest truth and my opinion and my facts
so going back to the snapchat incident I
did throw them away and I was really
offended that the wands weren't so bad
because I had high expectations from
Kylie when I went on Twitter I was kind
of venting about it and all of a sudden
thousands of girls started tweeting me
pictures of their wands now I had no
idea that Kylie kind of addressed this
on her snapchat but it was just put to
rest no one got any new wands no one was
getting refunds customer service was
just ignoring everyone now this was from
a lot of customers on Twitter telling me
this
not just me making this up out of thin
air this is a actual fact and it had
been about 18 days since people got all
the defective wands and they had heard
silence so I did open up my big mouth
and I'm really glad I did it because so
many people finally got new ones and the
issue was addressed but prior to me
making a big fuss about it no one had
heard anything about it so I feel like
no matter what anyone wants to say about
me or judge me about it for judging her
brand I did it because I am a consumer
and I think at the end of the day people
forget just because I am somebody that
is well-known and I have my own cosmetic
brand pretend none of that should exist
at heart I am a consumer I'm a makeup
artist since I was 12 years old I am a
makeup lover and this is my entire
passion in my career so obviously I had
no idea that it would be such big news
all of a sudden the next morning I wake
up and it's like Cosmo magazine
seventeen and InStyle and Daily Mail and
all these new sites started writing
about makeup artists Geoffrey start I
call you and I'm just like I didn't
attack anyone I was just giving my
honest opinions and that's just what it
is it was honest and if people were
offended that I judged her brand I'm
sorry the ones were shitty there really
were and finally they acknowledged it
after I gave it so much attention so if
I were to never speak up about it when
it would anyone get refunds would anyone
get new ones I don't know that's up to
you guys to you know obviously determine
that I think the big stink of it at the
end of the day was another incident
which most people have seen or heard
about this drama is me judging Kylie's
brand and then a month later I put out
highlighters and there was this kid on
YouTube who a lot of you have seen this
video and he received a broken
highlighter now let's start from that
fucking whole beginning because that got
really crazy and really ugly very
quickly and I don't think people know
the full story before my skin frost
highlighters were ever on sale on my
website before they ever shipped out
into the world I sold them at a can
vention called RuPaul's Drag Khan now
there was about almost 20,000 people
that convention I debut the product
there in hand so there was no shipping
involved and a few people got broken
ones which I did not know at the time
that they were already broken when we
sold them so let me just do a little
back track I want to give a little back
story on manufacturing all four shades
were made separate so when they did ice
cold they made all the ice cold at the
same time then move on to King Tut we
did a hundred thousand right off the bat
to start of King Tut now I was unaware
when they were traveling meaning when
they were picked up from a third-party
truck it's a delivery truck that
constantly take to make it from the
factory and then they drive it to my
warehouse where we of course ship it out
to all of you guys I was unaware that
one of the forklifts had dropped about
three to four thousand King Tut's on the
fucking concrete like biome and they
were shattered it was horrifying now the
worst part about it is is we were all
unaware until they started to ship out
weeks after the dragon incident enter
rocky roadkill who at Dragon got a
broken highlighter now a lot of people
were tweeting me who this kids talking
shit about you he's like doing a
clickbait video you really got to check
it out and I was like what the hell like
are people really coming for me like I
honestly was like oh God and you know it
had been a really long day I logged in
to YouTube clicked and I saw the title
and the first five seconds of the video
was like him crying or something and I
was like what the fuck is going on
so my dumb ass did not fully watch the
video which i 100% admit and that was
probably my biggest mistake so instead
of fully watching the video and
understanding what happened I went on
his comments section I was like look
bitch are you out of your motherfucking
mind so I went off for a second and
wrote a comment now
that situation was put to rest I feel
like people wanted me to make a whole
video dedicated to it and it's like I
don't need to address every comment that
I leave somebody and I think it just got
really ugly out of hand in case you were
unaware I did write back to his second
video and after a while people were
leaving death threats
really ugly comments and just being so
ugly I actually removed the comment and
just screenshot of it and I deemed him
directly but in case you were not aware
let me read it verbatim I said hey boo
now that things have calmed down
I'd love to personally send you a
message and apologize for the comment I
made on your previous video that day I
had so many people tweeting me and
filling my head with lies saying that
you made a video degrading me the title
of the video is definitely something
that shocked me and I should have known
better and watched the entire thing
myself
I regret judging you before writing
anything at the time of drag con I was
not aware of the incident when they were
delivered to my warehouse all the colors
were in separate boxes everything seemed
perfect I had no idea that some of the
King Tut's were broken previous to me
getting them in my hands so after we
shipped them I was horrified and
heartbroken as a brand owner that so
many people experienced the broken
highlighter and you know out of the
hundreds of thousands that sold that
week there was three thousand that were
bad and it stole three thousand
customers that got a shitty experience
and for that I am forever sorry and it
just sucks so I said you know now that
I've addressed the issue and now I know
the real reason for what happened to
your highlighter I know that you no
longer support me 100% respect that did
not think that you should respect me
after the incident but I just wanted to
clear the air so everyone knows the
truth about what really went down now
that we are past that I think it's time
to start this review so I just basically
I wanted to give a little history
because this review is not coming from a
negative place whether these lipsticks
are great or not you guys are gonna have
to continue and see what happens so if
you want to see me swatch colour-pop
Kylie and Milani keep on watching
alright so let's dive into it the first
brand that we're gonna try out is color
pop now they recently just launched four
shades new metallic formula and bam
let's open up the sky on their website
it says metals just like the Kylie ones
this was the PR package it came in there
are four shades let's see here we got
man
eater very cute bronzy one and then we
got 3-way okay girl I see you that's
like a more raspberry metallic and then
we got another more copper shade this
one is called Queen kW II and okay girl
and then the fourth one is a more deep
bronze color and that is called zebra so
I'm just going to try to shades out of
all the brands so my mouth does not fall
off and I think I'm gonna pick this
copper one and then this maybe the
darker one now these are liquid
lipsticks but on their site it says this
is a super intense metallized liquid
lipstick that is dripping with
high-impact metallic pearls this is a
non drying formula so that is not
supposed to dry all the way down so that
should be a quick disclaimer it does not
dry all the way down and it is not
transfer proof meaning it will come off
if you eat or drink I think but it says
this formula was created to be luxurious
smooth and leave a super comfortable
feel on the lips while the formula is
not completely transfer resistant it is
extremely long wearing alright so I'm
gonna try a man-eater first alright so
let's get into this it's kind of a
little first impressions for every
branch they have not tried these now
this applicator is a very cute and
little you can see it there they don't
really smell bad at all now my sinus is
our little clogged from his crazy
allergy season of summer but not bad at
all let's give it a whirl
okay so right off the bat this is a very
lightweight it almost feels a little dry
not like it's drying up my mouth to
death but it just feels like it's a
little dry it could be from the pearls
in the pigment okay so right off the bat
let me zoom in on myself the coverage is
really nice actually there's a tiny bit
of transfer not bad at all not sticky at
all which I love because I hate when you
like to put your lips together and your
lips are like
I'll be like holding on for dear life
like my state this is really good I'm
like hmm okay color Bob I see you okay
so let me quickly wipe this off and then
we're gonna try three-way now this color
is so pretty it's three-way it is a like
metallic berry color really pretty and
let's do it on the bones right off the
bat I can already tell that this one is
a little less pigmented it just seems a
little more sheer to me already just
from putting on the first application
this one has a lot of glitter in it
which i think is so pretty you
definitely got to dip in several times
more than the first shade okay let's let
this dry I just hit lipstick in my hair
okay thank God so when I put two coats
of this on it was a way more full
coverage so I think the copper one
before it was a little bit more
pigmented but when you layer it it
doesn't get weird which if you guys are
a liquid lipstick lever sometimes if you
layer the liquid lipstick can get gummy
it cracks or it just doesn't settle
correctly but this layered actually
really great so I had no issues putting
on a second coat this one is really
pretty
hmm still that same moisturised effect
it's not drying or anything so okay
color pop I see you now for six dollars
you really cannot go wrong with these so
I am a fan of these now let's get onto
Kylie's
now the next brand I'm gonna try is
Kylie cosmetics she recently put out
metals which are her metallic formula
and I have que majesty and err now I
heard a lot of controversy about this
shade so I got it in the mail about a
week ago I have not tried it yet first
of all I know a lot of people have been
reviewing them and there's one review
that has over a million views and people
are going crazy about it so I'm like
okay I have the shade - let me give it a
whirl quick disclaimer a lot of these
are sold out right now and these retail
for eighteen dollars a piece I'm gonna
be Jeffrey of course and pick the dark
metallic one first I'm
drawn two weird colors of lipsticks it
was black weird anymore
I don't think so this comes in a similar
packaging of color pop I mean this is
kind of bizarre to me I always thought
these are identical components but of
course all of the rumors that they are
made at the same Factory I don't fucking
know I don't care but color pops is
sickening so let's give this one a whirl
now the color pop wand was a little more
fatter this one as you can see is a
little thinner it looks kind of more
flat now to me
these smell really intense I wish they
would just tone it down a tiny bit
it is a little more streaky now I am
layering it again and it is helping so
maybe like the color pop it does need
two layers let me dip in again the wand
on the color pop one was a little more
easier to use the seneschal is very like
it was really light for some reason the
color pop ones are a little more heavy
going back over a second time
I just feel moisturizing like the color
pop one it's not tacky it's not sticky
it does give a little more like a weird
film on your lips but it's not bad it
feels very hydrating which is amazing
because no one wants to dry as lips now
I am just going to touch up a little bit
because as you can see if we zoom in it
is just kind of patchy and stir icky a
little bit so I'm gonna put a tiny bit
more now this wand is very kind of flat
and stiff maybe the pearls did not love
the material because that has happened
to me before
alright this is dried down now I love
the color
I think this metallic black is very
innovative no one has really done this
before the formula I think could be a
little bit more opaque but coming from
someone that also makes a liquid
lipsticks it is very hard to get a
metallic to be really opaque and just to
give that beautiful shine now that we've
tried this one let's do the second one
which is called air alright now this
shade oh this looks really pretty this
is like a champagne nude with like gold
or reflux in it let's give it a whirl
now this wand already looks way better
than the black one and still has that
really strong like liquorice scent as
the other one alright let's try it
okay this definitely has a different
texture than que majesty
this one is more kind of like a mu C and
it's a little streaky but the coverage
is still nice I just kind of had to
finesse it with a wand and only thing is
is it's not really giving me like
metallic there's like a little bit of
Sheen in it but the black one was like
blinging and like the colour-pop ones
were like a really glittery of metallic
this one is a little more subdued all
right let's let this dry down first
impressions is I actually like this
formula way more than que majesty this
one just kind of blended a lot more
easier and even though it's not as
metallic sized I like it gives a pretty
little Sheen to the lips very natural so
if you're afraid of the other
unconventional colors I think this one
would definitely suit you and it feels
really soft creamy and nice when I smile
not really any cracking at all it looks
really cute so I think definitely out of
the two I like this one better
alright now the third brand that I'm
gonna try is the new Milani amore
metallics these are so pretty now a few
weeks ago I tried this in my summer glow
makeup tutorial and I was like oh but I
want to see if the other shades match
because sometimes brands do not have
consistency in their formulas so
sometimes one will be amazing and then
another shirt will be kind of ant so I'm
like okay this one is cute we've tested
her so I found four more now these are
$8.99 so they are a little bit more
affordable than the Kylie ones but a
little higher than colour-pop these are
a limited edition and on the Milani
website it says that these are both in
richly pigmented these metallic liquid
lip colors shine with a soft luster and
dried to a smooth matte finish without
drying out your lips waterproof and kiss
approved each and more metallic lip
cream delivers up to 16 hours of wear
I removed with an oil-based a long-wear
lip color remover okay cool so these are
supposed to dry down and stay for a
minute I'm like okay girl I see you so
I'm gonna try out let's say you guys
know I want to do the pink so let me
just pluck these out sorry girls I'll
see you on the next one so I'm gonna do
this one called a cinematic it is kind
of like a fuchsia metallic pink I mean
hi right up my alley so let's give her a
spin now this one looks so pretty in the
bottle I'm like don't do me wrong oh wow
see right off the bat full coverage come
on Milani so my videographer can smell
the lip paint fragrance all the way from
back there it is very very strong it's
like growing but I've toned it down
now obviously we talked about it before
but a lot of brands use really strong
fragrances to mask the raw material
ingredients so this one is definitely
like who like slaps you in the face now
that was just with one swipe I'm gonna
dip in to finish the last part of my lip
but that was a lot of coverage for just
dipping in once alright BAM now this
color is gorgeous
I am really like oh I'm like amazed this
has been sitting in my drawer for a few
weeks now I've been waiting to get some
other shades to review them all at once
and this one I'm like damn I slept on
this one this is so pretty
I'm like looking close up really nice
coverage not weird at all when I smile
it does not crack or anything which is
really nice hi there okay cool let's try
a different shade now the last one I'm
gonna try is this one what is this one
called dramatic diva this one is a
straight-up Barbie pink and when I'm
holding it up in the light it has kind
of like a gold reflex in there it looks
super pretty
now this dough foot is a lot longer than
the Kylie and the colour-pop ones I
prefer this because it gets the whole
mouth really quick
okay when the light hits this lip I am
living this color is so gorgeous I'm
like oh my god okay this is like my
tenth swatch of my mouth is like this
would know so I am gonna leave it like
that I think it looks really pretty
really gorgeous I'm like okay dramatic
diva I see you I might have to order
like ten more of these before they're
gone because this one is a keeper
alright let's get our engines ready and
let's pick the winner so I just tried
three brands three different formulas
and all different shades so who is gonna
win what is the drumroll for me I really
really really actually like all of them
I know that's gonna probably shock all
of you but I think they all have their
pros and cons but the winner is Milani
now this formula is just a plus it
glides on amazing it is waterproof it
does not come off which I love because a
lot of the metallics like they just come
off after like 30 minutes and you have
to reapply or they get kind of patchy
and weird which is what I've noticed
with a lot of brands but these are
unreal now if these ones were a little
more long where they would probably be
up there but they're not bad I think the
colour-pop one is amazing for six
dollars they are beautiful now for 18 I
do wish that these would be a little bit
more metallic and a little bit more long
wear but it is all up to personal
opinions so of course as always these
are just my thoughts we all have
different experiences with makeup
I bought the Kylie &amp;amp; Milani ones out of
my own pocket and colour-pop graciously
sends me PR to try their stuff
now just because people send me stuff
doesn't mean I have to say I like it or
there's no secret contract behind hidden
doors it's just either I like it or I
don't and I love trying stuff out for
you guys and I do think that these are
worth the money so at the end of the day
we're all going to have different
experiences with makeup these are mine
take it for what you want and I hope
that you guys try these and let me know
your thoughts if there are any more
metallic lips that you want me to try
leave some brand
in the comments down below and I will
see you guys on the next one
