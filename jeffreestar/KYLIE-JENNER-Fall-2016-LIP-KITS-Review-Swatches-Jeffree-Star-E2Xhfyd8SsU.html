channel now today I'm gonna be diving
into some lip swatches oh my poor mouth
I'm gonna put it through some more abuse
and today I'm gonna be swatching all six
of the new Kylie lip kits there's four
where's the other two come on up here
y'all BAM all six of these guys now she
recently put out three brand new ones
alike a few weeks ago and then the other
three are from like a month ago that I
haven't even got to try or swatch yet
because life has just gone crazy and
where has the time gone I have no idea
but as always if you've never tried
Kylie's lipsticks she has put out a
bunch of colors now there's a wide
variety of shades which I love they are
for every skin tone and in case you've
never tried them they are $29 each so
they come with a liquid lipstick and a
lip liner now if you want to buy the
singles I know some of the shades come
like that without the liner so it's
cheaper but I know that all the new ones
you gotta buy the damn liner I just got
back from Michigan and a bunch of East
Coast traveling so a bitch is exhausted
but it's glad to be back on YouTube I've
missed you all and um let's dive into
some makeup so the first shade is called
a dirty peach now peach is like trending
a lot in makeup I know Too Faced is
having a whole peach collection later
this year which thank God because I
can't wait for that I'm loving peach we
all know my peach goddess highlight yes
gob gob God
now I haven't used any of these liquid
lipsticks besides the first three colors
I know that what do they call it candy
king coke okay were some of the very
first few put out and I love those ones
but I can't wait to try these ones so
now I know it comes with a liner and a
lot of people are like well sometimes
they work better if you put the liquid
lip over the liner but I think they work
by themselves they should um I just
don't really want to line my lips but I
do want to show first of all they're
creamy like the lip liners are amazing
so this formula for this particular item
in her line I love it
liner is
all right this formula is good so I'm
just gonna do a tiny little bit and then
I'm really going to just go right in now
every liquid lip I love to shake it for
a second now these ones same kind of
like licorice strong sugar smell as all
the other ones now as always I think
this smell is a little too intense for
me but once it dries down it goes away
so it's not the end of the world but um
let's see what she looks like okay so as
you can see the lip liner is darker than
the actual lipstick which will give your
lips some added definition which I love
that and two dips should cover the
entire mouth
all right this shade is drying down
basically these dry quick which I love I
hate a liquid lip that takes a few or
like five minutes to dry you're like
mm-hmm looking in the monitor and I'm
Michael I love this color with pink hair
by the way
now her formula they dry down quick this
one is fully opaque now I've had some
trouble with some previous shades like
that dark purple court Kay oh my god
that that was one of the ones where
I was like hmm like Willie streaky and
not amazing but um this one I'm like oh
hi already dry now sometimes with brands
not every color matches with that
consistency which I've definitely had a
problem with in this line but I gotta
say this one smells pretty good all
right the next shade is called a love
bite this is like a dusty dark mauve
color which she looks like this and um
let's see what it looks like
oh okay color
oh this color I mean since we're about
to get into fall season this is
definitely something that I can see a
lot of people wearing
whoa now that this color is dry I think
I mean I know I haven't swatched all the
other ones yet but already number two
I'm like this is my favorite one
oof mmm this is a very sultry perfect
for the fall season and I'm a fan of you
guys and once again the formula was just
like the first one it was not streaky it
was fully opaque and down feels good no
complaints
the third shade is called brown sugar
she looks like this now this is I guess
like a warm tone brown color it looks
pretty in the bottle and I love me a
good nude so uh let's take her for a
spin
all right this is brown sugar now I'm
looking at the monitor and it's a dope
color it's very like old-school early
90s type of vibe I'm not sure if I love
it or if it kind of looks like baby
kind of like babies boom boom I don't
know but it's also really gorgeous I'm
really in a love-hate relationship with
this shade the tone I think is a way too
warm for me personally exam very cool
tone and then this pink hair is very
cool so I think this shade is kind of
like bouncing off of my energy my vibes
and the only thing I will say about this
one is that it's a tiny bit streaky on
the edges but overall the formula is
very consistent with all the others and
now we're gonna do the three that came
out I think a month ago and this one is
called Malibu alright I know that this
one has been very popular and I've been
dying to try it so um let's see what
happens
all right this color is dry it really
reminds me of my own celebrity skin I
think a lot of people have said this is
a dupe for it and it's pretty darn close
so obviously I love the color it is
gorgeous
and the same thing I think all the
formulas are now really consistent in
this line which thank you Jesus but um
this one's cute alright the next shade
that we're gonna do is one called
Kristen and this one is like a reddish
peaches toned color it looks cool in the
bottle um let's see what it looks like
on my mouth
oh okay this one definitely looks a
little brighter on the lips than it does
in the bottle which is obviously not a
bad thing it looks cool it's drying down
I really think that this color might be
my favorite I know I said it love-bite
earlier was the one but for some reason
this looks like it's like a terracotta
nude and a watermelon had a baby and um
I'm living for it I'm looking at the
mirror like oh I think with the blue
eyes and the hair and the gold highlight
this is stunning
alright so we have one more to go and
it's called exposed and it is more in
the brown tone family so even though I
haven't worn it yet I feel like this is
the one for me so exposed looks like
this it's almost if Malibu and wear the
other one called
oh my god brown sugar had a baby it's
really pretty I think it's definitely
the lightest one of the collection and I
know that one Kylie snapchat she said
that this is like her favorite one to
wear so let's see how she looks on this
is a record just color I'm like ok so I
can go with like any outfit I think
this one is really gorgeous um I think
it's my third favorite so my top three
of course are Kristen loved by and
exposed this one is gorgeous I think
this is what I wanted brown sugar to be
that one just did not fly on me but all
the other shades I love I'm really
excited to see what Kylie cosmetics
comes out with next and I just want to
say a quick shout out to you guys thank
