channel today we're doing a first
impressions on the new Kylie cosmetics
kai-shan oohs the bronze palette and the
birthday collection this is a heavy bag
full of delicious makeup out like most
Kylie products this was really hard to
get at the last second I snagged one
from the website I'm like yes girl you
better work when I first saw this I was
like okay girl like eye shadows okay now
obviously I had one little bad
experience with this brand does that
mean I have to hate every product and
talk that's not my style there are
so many opinions on me judging other
brands because I have my own a my
perfect no I'm not I think I've
been buying makeup and a consumer for
about 15 years now so I think I'm
allowed to judge and can people judge me
yes they can so moving forward I'm
excited to try a bunch of her new stuff
now this shadow palette I love the
packaging you guys know I'm the
packaging or I love the eyes on the
front and of course it did come with
this card that everybody's talking about
and if everybody's talking about it
that's a good thing because you know you
made a damn mark so it has that famous
postcard that winks at you I think it is
really cute with a little message on the
back now this palette comes in this unit
carton now it looks something like this
now of course I think with every palette
the outside drips matches what's on the
inside
now the shade names are on the back and
then the birthday Collection so this is
a limited edition bundle item all the
items in here are limited and the cool
thing about this is they all come in
gold packaging I love and brands change
their packaging color this gold is
really gorgeous I think the packaging
looks expensive so if you want to see me
get into all this goodness and get to
some damn makeup then keep on watching
I'm trying to smoke some weed
and Nathan to leave me a lighter
about to rub to make up stick together
get some fire alright so obviously you
guys can see
full foundation on contour highlight and
the brows so this is Kylie's first ever
eyeshadow palette it's called the bronze
palette now when I first saw this
packaging I really loved it I think it's
different it's dope I love the drawing
of the eyes on the front very cute and
I'm sure as more eyeshadow pallete roll
out there will be different colors so of
course this one is bronze now from
seeing so many people review this so far
I gotta say one thing people were kind
of being shady about the colors a lot of
people are trying to compare them to
other brands but do you ever see Kylie
not just wear these colors like I've
maybe for photoshoots once in a while
but this SKU is pretty much her like
this sums up her style I think just from
a viewer you know she doesn't wear hot
pinks and blues and yellows so I feel
like she shouldn't put out something
right off the bat with those colors
because it's just not authentic now
obviously I have not dived into the
shadows yet but if you want to see
swatches of all these this ain't a video
for that so if you want to see a bunch
of swatches check out manis or Laura
Lee's I will link their review down
below this is just going to be a first
impressions on using them on my face so
when I first first saw this I was like
wait a minute this kind of looks like
this guy I'm not being Shady I'm just
keeping it really real I was like wait a
minute
kind of looks like the Mannie palette
not the colors I'm just saying the
layout is very similar and I know a lot
of people are being kunti because
there's no mirror on this um you know
for the price point I definitely think
there should be a mirror for $42 I'm
like damn girl damn damn
girl do I think the mirror is like a
necessity I don't think so I personally
get ready with a ring light when I'm not
filming like it just if I'm going out I
don't hold up a palette and do my eyes
but I know a lot of people do when they
travel or they're in the car so I don't
know I feel like if you're a makeup
lover you already own 20 million
palettes anyway so stop whining let's
get into the colors now for today's
little smokey winged eye I'm going to be
using some scotch tape to cut that

out and I'm just going to follow my
natural lash line and see what happens I
just try to eyeball these and pray to
Jesus that they line up perfectly of
course it's not always going to be
perfect you can always touch it up when
you remove it later now I'm going to be
taking this light shade called Jasper
and I'm gonna be taking that all over my
entire kind of like eye area so kind of
from brow to lid I'm gonna put this down
there alright so first impressions is or
brooch this is good drew now I love a
good white bone color for under the brow
this is very china white and well of it
alright now we're going to take a little
blending brush and dip into Citroen this
gorgeous orange transition color I just
I just love it a transition color and
we're just gonna put this right in our
crease and I'm kind of gonna create a
little just a little extra Bowl well cut
lit in there oh okay this one is a very
cute okay girl I love this one so far
now it definitely has a lot of Fallout
but once it's on the brush and it hits
your skin it's like Bale hail hail
I am gonna bring it into my kind of my
little brow bone nose area and I'm gonna
drag this out we are getting draggy and
bitchy today and we're gonna take this
and go all the way on the side of that
tape we're dragging her out all right
now I'm going to be dipping into the
cream shadow this is shade copper and I
have never used this before as you can
see but let's give it a whirl
I'm just gonna kind of cut out where
that white shadow is I'm gonna place
this in there and let's see what happens
you all see that I'm like oh my god this
 looks yummy yummy okay so I'm just
gonna take that and kind of like cut out
on my lid and just kind of create a
moment the consistency of this is really
creamy it is a really easy to blend I'm
like oh this is this is really nice and
I'm just taking this brush and we are
just cutting into our lid
I love how metallic this is like mmm
this copper one is everything now also
in her birthday collection there was
another shade called a rose gold so I
will definitely have to use this in a
future tutorial now I'm going to dip
into this shade called hematite it is
like a chocolate reddish toned Brown and
I'm just going to use a little Mac
blending brush and I'm just gonna go
right in that crease and start to darken
that area so right where that gold
copper shadow stops we are just adding
in some color and I'm also going to be
dipping into or on site and I'm gonna go
pull back and forth and kind of mix the
colors now these shadows this these ones
is well blend just like the transition
color so I think the mats are extremely
pigmented and they are blending great I
know everyone has had different
experiences but so far the
it's are really nice now I'm going to go
back into that transition color Citroen
and we are just going to just kind of
diffuse that dark crease a little more I
am going to be adding in a wing later so
this will all make sense shortly and now
I'm going to take this little detail
brush this is the morphe 507 and I'm
just going to barely touch obsidian this
is the black color and I am just gonna
kind of carve out a little bit more of
my lid and notice how I'm right now just
barely dragging it so when we do a whip
you know a liquid wing eye it's going to
you know just go with the flow now I
think it's time to remove this scotch
tape and pray that their even I
just like take little tweezers and oh my
god BAM
huh whew now there is a little bit of
scotch tape a little mark on my face I'm
gonna fix that in a second let's see
this side here I love how this looks
oh my god they're like really like
really even yes ma'am now I definitely
want to do a really sharp wing aligner
so I'm gonna be using that ardency in
punker black liquid liner this has a
sharp as
little tip look at that oh and I love
this guy it is easy to draw on and since
this isn't a Kylie product I am just
going to do my winged liner off-camera
and I'll be right back now that the wing
is ferocious I think I definitely need
to smoke out the bottom lashline a tiny
bit so I'm going to go back in with that
little morphe detail brush I think I'm
going to dip into Tiger eye which is
this beautiful kind of camel brown color
and let's start off with that guy so
we're just gonna be really soft
Genda I'm gonna connect that with the
wing and just kind of blend it
under it and instead of going all the
way in I'm gonna take the point of this
brush and really go in there so I'm not
gonna go all the way into my inner
corner of us gonna kind of stop at a
hair and leave a little bit of negative
space and then we're gonna drag out and
add a little bit more in there and I
just used a little NARS kabuki brush to
just soften and make sure there is no
fallout then I'm going to take a tiny
bit of Bronzite and I'm barely touching
the pan and on the outer edges of under
the eye I'm just gonna drag this brush
slightly just so it kind of darkens it
and gives it a little bit more dimension
all right
BAM I think we are officially done with
this palette for now now I of course I
did not try the two shimmer of shades
which a lot of people have been reading
to fill so I'm just going to touch them
right now on camera oh they look creamy
let me just do both of these real
quickly all right so that is the pigment
I just wanted to look at on my hat I
know that finger swatches are not always
the best but um I'm gonna give it a
whirl okay very pigmented oh now I heard
a lot of people had a tough time
blending these out on the lid of course
I am NOT gonna say that's correct or not
until I try it all right I am going to
quickly add in some I think liner in my
waterline I think I really want to make
this look pop and go to the next level
so I'm gonna be taking my favorite color
pop gel liner and this isn't shade honey
dude now this is a nude liner I love
this with a warm tone look it just makes
the eyes really pop now of course I
gotta do some lashes so before I do the
falsies we're going to use my favorite
benefit roller lash mascara now I heard
that they're coming out with a round
version of this I can't wait
I think the bottom mascara really made
this pop now I definitely don't want to
do crazy huge lashes to hide all this
beautiful work so I'm gonna be going
with that violet vos faux lashes I don't
know the style name you guys a were on
my desk from a previous encounter and I
don't know the style name but I'm gonna
pop these on really quick and I'll be
right back
alright these lashes are cute and they
really finish off the look so now what
time is it I think it's definitely time
that we dive into the birthday
Collection in this cute little bag you
get of course the classic mouth and then
this little zipper has a K on it really
cute
I was surprised on how much product was
in this there is a really good amount so
I'm just gonna pull it out like a magic
hat this is the Kylie Chi liner now this
was in dark bronze I didn't use it for
the look I really wanted that smoky and
then black sharp winged liner so I
didn't get to use this but I definitely
will have to try it you get a gel liner
in here and you also get a brush which I
thought was cute little liner brush and
then you also get a pencil so I will
definitely have to use this sometime
soon
now the lip stuff that's what I'm
excited about now this is a new shade
called leo by the way I have a shade
called leo coming out in October because
that's Nathan's zodiac sign so I was
like damn it but hey some brands have
similar name they really don't matter
but this is a lip kit so you get the lip
liner and the liquid lip which I love
the gold packaging by the way it looks
really cute now this color is like a
kind of like a burgundy let's swatch it
on the hand real quick I'm just gonna do
it on my under side of my hand you guys
these tattoos crazy crazy so let's see
what this looks like
oh and of course it has the classic
liquid lip smell that she has and then
the liner which I love the formula of
their aligners they are really creamy
and the payoff is nice and yes this
matches all the other ones should I wear
this with this lip let me let me see
what else is in here and then we're
going to decide we have a birthday
edition gloss and a metallic lip so the
metallic lip is called Lord oh this is
like gold gold and then what is this one
this is the gloss and it's called poppin
so these are both gold tones this one
the gloss is a little more brighter I'm
just gonna swatch this on my hand as
well oh that is pretty you guys you see
that shine this would be cool by itself
I'm gonna have to try that later over
like a little lip liner mmm and then
what do we have here this is the
metallic liquid lip it's gonna put it
right above that oh wow that is a really
nice coverage it's a little dark for my
taste I wish it was a little bit a
little less yellow tone but it says full
coverage and as mentioned earlier there
is one more cream shadow this is in
shade rose gold oh and I was gonna do a
little stool oh fingers watch oh I love
that color
yes mium ooh that is really pretty
this is the same formula as that color
on my lid so I cannot wait to put this
on my eyes soon and then we have of
course duh how could I forget about
the little baby miniature matte liquid
lips now love this gold unicorn really
really it's just really fetch yes
Gretchen um okay so this has six colors
and they are what do we have in here
girl
exposed Dolce K coke okay candy k and
Kristin you better work Kristin I just
think that this packaging is really
really gorgeous I'm obsessed with gold
you guys so I mean come on I got gold
teeth gold contact line
this gold okay so what am I gonna
put on my lips you guys I really don't
know I'm like freaking out here like I
really want to put on the gold but my
eyes are so copper and very gold so I
think I'm gonna go in with this leo
liquid lip and liner let's give it a
whirl you guys so I'm gonna do the liner
first and let's just dive in these lip
liners are so creamy I really love this
formula all right now that we're lipped
and lined let's go in with the matching
a liquid lip now quick little opinion
the lip liner is a little more dark
burgundy than this I know they're kind
of supposed to match but this one is a
lot more like a red toned
not that I mind I think it looks great
but just a little thought now the liquid
lip it was a tiny bit streaky I think
that putting the lip liner under it
definitely helps and it makes it look
very flawless this is a very fall look
and thank God we're getting in the fall
because I can't wait to coat my entire
existence in black and purple eye shadow
and get into some dark lips but um wow I
really like this look you guys so what
are my final thoughts
I forgot setting spray like do I have a
screw loose don't answer that okay let's
set this mother-effing face and today
we're gonna be using a little mist and
fix from Make Up For Ever we are set for
the gods now I'm kind of thinking about
doing a little maybe a little dark hair
for this look so I'm gonna go finish
this bowl and I'll be right back alright
guys this is the final look I really
love it I love how this look turned out
I think the eyes are vicious definitely
need to start using some more scotch
tape because that was easy now
final thoughts on the palette alright so
is this jeffree star approved this
palette is Geoffrey star approved now I
know there are a lot of mixed reviews
all over the internet I think that a lot
of people are just really feeding into
negativity and just wanting to hate some
because of maybe who it's made by or
past experiences I don't know but at the
end of the day an eyeshadow palette is
an eyeshadow palette you're paying for
the name you're paying for the brand and
at the end of the day these shadows work
is this worthy of the price I think it
could be a little cheaper but then again
you are paying for the name exactly like
if you're buying a high-end foundation
you know what you're getting into so is
this a must-have you are gonna die
without it palette definitely not if you
have morphe shadows or makeup geek you
can definitely find dupes i cannot wait
to see what kylie comes out with next i
mean come on guys we're all makeup
addicts and i know she got some good
 under her sleeve so thank you guys
so much for watching this video and for
just letting me be me i will see you on
the next one mwah better work bitch
we're creating a moment right here right
now I'm looking at the monitor like whoo
delicious
