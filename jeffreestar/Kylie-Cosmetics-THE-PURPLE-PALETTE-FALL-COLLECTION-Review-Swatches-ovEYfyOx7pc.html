channel today we are going to be diving
into the brand new Kylie cosmetics
purple eyeshadow palette we got some
brand new fall liquid lips and we have a
new highlighter from her brand it all
came together in this little black bag
so we are going to dive into everything
today we're gonna pull it out we're
gonna swatch it we're gonna try to do a
little look with it and we're gonna see
if the formula is consistent with
everything from the past now I haven't
reviewed anything Kylie in a while on my
channel the last collection
it wasn't mind-blowing it was a little
lackluster in my opinion just for the
design and the color for me it was just
kind of like yeah and that's okay I
think a lot of people take that and
that's like a negative doesn't mean you
hate a brand doesn't mean you don't like
somebody it just means you're really not
into that palette or that moment so if
you want to see me try everything inside
of here thank you for watching so this
collection comes with BAM this is the
purple palette now everything is in
matte black packaging which I kind of
live for we are in the month of October
so when you feel it it is like a soft
touch so there is a palette we are gonna
create a little ilyich with it today and
then how many liquid lips do we have in
here five liquid lip Libra wicked
butternut hazel and autumn and they of
course are all black with the colors on
the lips alike and normal now we all
know that these lip kits are retail for
twenty nine dollars and they do come
with a liquid lip and a lip liner the
palette is 42 dollars we just got to
open her up and see what the healthy
even in here of course I have reviewed
the bronze palette and the burgundy
palette on my channel laughs no not
earlier this year so here is the purple
palette if you've never seen it Kylie
eyeshadow palette before her first and
her second one's ever released had this
packaging so the teardrops of course are
going to match the colors that are on
the inside so we are going to open her
up and here is what she looks like now I
do want to note that I'm really glad
that they started to add mirrors in
these palettes because the first two did
not have a mirror and the internet was
running their damn mouth
so of course you get a nine pen palette
and this is the color scheme Wow now I
will say this before I even try this
purple eyeshadows are hard to make I
don't know why well I do know why but
why they're so difficult to make it has
to do with the pigments and how you make
everything so if you notice other brands
do purple eyeshadows bitch you see me
struggle on this channel with some
Purple's they are hard to make we are
about to put this on my eyes right now
and besides that oh we can't forget the
highlighters there is a Reaper motion of
three of the loose powder highlighters
from the vacation collection which me
and Nathan reviewed a few months ago
I'll link that down below alright but
besides the three that she is reap
remoting there is a new one called
wisteria and it looks like this let's
just open her up anyway my cheeks don't
have any metallics I almost want to do
that first oh oh this is like a shimmery
like purple maybe I want to highlight on
my face right now so I'm gonna just do
this first before we even do the eye
looks let me pour some out like I
normally do oh wow this is a lot of
purple glitter and here is that on the
brush we're gonna do a little zooming
girl look at that
alright enough talking let's see if it
applies on my cheeks Oh
oh my god it's literally like ice on my
cheeks let me blend it out so it doesn't
look as crazy okay wait a minute
as I'm blending it out it did definitely
diffuse alright so when I first swiped
it it was really intense and then as I
moved it around with the brush it got
more sheer so if you're someone that
likes a little bit of a like a whimsical
moment this is cute for you if you want
it to pack a punch you can wet your
brush with fix+ or layer on just for
shits and giggles I'm going to try a
morphe fan brush this is what I used to
always put on highlighter with and let's
see if it applies any different with the
fan okay alright so when applying this
of course you do see that it's sheer I
am someone that likes more of a blinding
highlight so I'm just gonna try one
thing I'm just gonna spray my cheek with
some morphe prep and set and let's go in
one more time and let's see how this
applies oh there we go
so there is this side with no fix+ and
then here is this side which one do you
guys like more I kind of like this
so more let's keep it gangster so I'm
just knocking on my door I had a package
and I went downstairs for a few minutes
grabbed a drink I'm back upstairs and no
tea no shade but this highlighter it's
like a very glittery where it really
didn't stick to the skin like I'm
looking over here on my gaff
it looks pretty because the beauty
lights are all reflecting but like if I
just want like that I'm like it comes
off really easy definitely not the same
consistency I feel like as the vacation
collection which they're sitting right
here so I'm gonna take one out and see
if this is the same as the other formula
that came out this summer because girl
something may add enough all right so
here is Center eenie we're just gonna
pour a little bit in here I'm just gonna
take a this is a good clean powder brush
I'm just gonna go like this once girl
really like there's hardly any
highlighter let me just go like this hmm
we're gonna take the other color
Santorini let's just apply that to the
cheeks bitch you see that motherfuckin
glow that's what I'm talking about
all right so if you were someone that
wants a little more of a subtle glow you
might want to go with wisteria wisteria
I'm probably saying it wrong but look at
the end of the day the formula is
definitely not the same there is a
little bit of an inconsistency there so
we're gonna start off the review with
some real fucking tea but look at the
fucking lighthouse that I just put on my
damn cheek like that is what I'm talking
about
all right let's jump into the eyeshadow
palette all right you guys so let's see
if these eyeshadows are consistent with
the previous formula so of course we saw
this in the intro BAM so of course the
shade names are on the back of here and
of course they're on the back of here in
case you forget now this palette is
interesting this is fall time and I
think that everyone always kind of like
does the same thing so I'm not mad at
this color story at all I think that so
many people stick to we know what they
know and basic brown shadows so I think
it's really cool that she at least it's
something different y'all can't hate on
it
alright so of course before I do any eye
tutorial I always use my Mac painterly
paint-pot so we are gonna bust that out
today and we're just gonna take a little
Mac synthetic brush right here and okra
just get worn in
I'm member and this is brand new all
right so I'm just gonna take a little
bit on the brush not a lot now I do have
deep sockets that go in so I go all the
way even up a little bit because we are
gonna put some shadow up there
all right so we're gonna take this brush
we're gonna go to this top left shade
right here and it's called periwinkle
girl periwinkle is like purplish color
whatever okay so this one is a shimmer
of course let me just go like this yep
it is definitely a pale shimmer it
almost looks like the highlighter I'm
wearing on my cheeks okay that has some
shimmer to it someone's gonna take us to
do this on my brow bone I know most of
you have brow so you will skip this part
or you can put this below your brow bone
oh I like this because it looks wet it's
almost like wet metal and I'm down for
it
this one blended really great it
obviously has a lot of pigment
definitely blinding let's move on and
now we are going to take a little fluffy
brush and we are going to go in with
shade blueberry it is like this grayish
color it definitely has a little bit of
a blue undertone I'm just gonna take
that and I'm going to just blend it
right there in the crease and let's see
how it looks
so what I loved about putting down a
shiny base or anything like that is that
when you're blending this it's very
thick effortless where you're just kind
of like buffing and blending up take
your time and then it will look very
seamless we're gonna take a little bit
more we're gonna put it right where my
eyelids sink in of course and then we're
gonna bring it down a little bit so it's
almost like a little sea motion right on
the lid as well
so blueberry she's pigmented it blended
really nice and I really like how this
looks all right I think I'm gonna take
what is a shade called lilac this soft
purple right here and ooh it's coated
the brush really good so you know this
shit is about to blend hopefully now I'm
gonna take this color and I'm gonna put
it actually here so we're gonna press
that right on the lid oh and I'm gonna
actually take that and I like to take my
shadows a little further in especially
with no brow and put that right in there
oh girl I love this lid color okay cute
now this and the intro when I said
purples were difficult to make light
colors easy peasy but these type of
colors are a little difficult so I'm
just gonna take a little bit I'm gonna
put it I'm trying to rein the middle
kinda okay she's cute it's buildable now
this one definitely has a lot of fallout
we'll show the palette right now here's
all the colors I've touched into and
what they look like I'm taking the brush
this is like a round brush this one is
the number 19 from Chanel so we're gonna
take this and I'm actually gonna tuck it
into my crease so I'm gonna actually
look up so you guys can see exactly
what's going on and just press it in
there and just kind of go like that
alright before we do the other side I do
want to zoom in a little bit cuz that
color girl I might need to spray the
brush look at my look at my face like
all that fall out so what do we do we'll
go take a little Laura Mercier powder
and if the shadows are already on the
face I like to just brush away like that
really lightly and just pray it doesn't
stick to your skin because then you
gotta fix your foundation and a redo at
all of course we definitely need some
lashes today but I think I'm gonna do
what other what other I wish I could
talk to you guys right now what other
colors do you guys want to see
definitely that is not my vibe a bronze
color for this purple look I'm not
feeling so maybe we do these two and
just smoke out the lower lashline a
little bit add some white liner and make
it pop do some lashes and smoke a bowl
so let's get to it let me take my trusty
fascinating white pencil from Mac this
is such an easy creamy formula that just
goes right in the waterline and this is
gonna make the look really pop
and now we're gonna take wine and dine
and turning violet or maybe we're gonna
mix these up let's just see how this one
performs by itself
I'm loving the full purple everything
vibes we will just run that under the
eye very lightly this is like full
purple smokey eye today alright now I'm
gonna take a tiny bit of wine and dine
this color right here and I'm just going
to deepen the outer edges on the
waterline like right below it so we're
just gonna just a little hint of color
we're gonna deepen right in here alright
so this look is definitely missing some
mascara and lashes so I'm gonna go
quickly do it off camera and I'll be
right back
alright so of course I wiped off the lip
we are about to swatch all day liquid
lipstick put on lashes and then it kind
of hid all of the eye shadows so I'm
gonna live with the fantasy of just
mascara and of course so I don't have to
tell you benefit roller lash BAM
back to the Kylie cosmetics matte liquid
lipsticks of course you guys know these
also come with a liner i just opened all
them and pulled them out we have five
shades i'm gonna swatch them on my hands
i think a few of these normal like nudes
and i don't you just watch all five
maybe if i don't you guys are gonna
fight me at home let's just see how my
lips feel for the first shade i'm gonna
swatch of course we're we're in the fall
vibes people so this shade is called
autumn it looks something like this now
you guys know they do come with lip
liners i hardly ever use them i just go
in with the wand and see what happens
same I call it licorice same scent as
all of them have previously been since
the beginning of her launch you know I'm
not the biggest fan of it but I whatever
it is what it is okay
all right here is autumn it is almost
dried down now of course with this I
look I don't love it but by itself like
let's pretend my lids are not purple I
love this color by itself like right now
with the blonde hair I love it with
purple not so much okay so this color is
cute love it formula same as before as
all her other ones will know they're not
always consistent we have seen that on
this channel but this one is it feels
fine and yeah let's move on let's move
on to the next color and now we are
going to dive into the shade wicked
which is this purple here purple eyes
purple lips pink and purple shirt it
might look a little too much or it could
be thumbnail worthy let's find out
okay now I know this is a lot of purple
going on here but I kind of live for it
this one speaking of inconsistencies
this one was a little bit more hard to
apply I need like two layers and it's a
little more dry than the first one I
don't know why maybe it's the pigments
or the color but yeah but overall I
think it looks cute and yeah let's move
on alright that purple had some sort of
like red base to it which a lot of
Purple's do stay in my mouth a little
bit but I did try to cover with
foundation but um that color is a little
dry just putting it out there
okay next color is Libra and this is a
very light nude you have to be a pale
bitch to use this or you can put it in
the center of an ombre maybe but this
looks really light in here so let's see
how it applies oh wow bitch that's like
the color of my damn skin tone
all right here is libres watch now even
though it is really light I'm always
down for an ood and I think since my
eyes are so like intense this color
actually now that's dry it's a little
darker than my skin tone and I'm I don't
mind it I think it's really pretty and I
am a nude lipstick whore so this is
probably my favorite so far
okay so actually Nathan and I are about
to a good dinner and I'm gonna keep this
nude lip on because of my mouth it's
hurting girl this formula when you wipe
it off like look at my little my mouth
parts so I'm not gonna leave you guys
hanging I am gonna swatch the last two
this one is called hazel girl we just
gonna put it right on my hand you guys
know the drill when I do that you can
obviously see oh this one has full
opacity and this color is pretty it
reminds me of something - I'd like an
honest hacia color I have but it is
definitely a warm toned caramel brown I
love it it is really pretty but this one
butternut I don't know girl mmm I think
this is like maybe one of the very few
colors that she's released and I'm like
I don't know if that colors for me let's
put it on oh no not on me baby mm-hmm to
me this looks like I don't know what
does it remind me of like a diaper a
diaper
I'm so fucking dumb you guys okay it
just looks a little not my favorite
everything else loved it the purple was
a little dry for me this one I just
personally would not wear I'm sure some
of y'all can rock the fuck out of that
color but this shade was probably my
favorite so okay we've seen all the
colors we've seen everything no let's
give my final thoughts alright you guys
so I'm sure you all are wondering and a
lot of you fast forward to this part so
I'm just gonna say it out loud here and
now the Kylie cosmetics purple palette
hit jeffrey's are approved yes clearly
you guys all saw at work I think the
colors blended amazing definitely an
improvement since a few pallets ago
there's a few issues I had with it but
it seems to be fixed and everything
performed great there was of course
extreme fallout with this shade down
here but once I tilted my head and
pressed it in in a different technique
it was fine the mattes blended all great
the shimmers obviously bitch
blinding here let's talk about the lips
all the lips were great except the
purple was a little too drying for me I
don't mind one thing stain my lips
because that happens it's makeup clearly
we've all been through that before
whether it's the lids or the mouth
makeup stains once in a while I just
didn't like that it was a little more
drying than the other ones and a little
streaky I definitely had to put two
layers on which made it more heavy and
trying to meet every other color was
great of course I did not put the last
two on my lips but Adam and Libra were
amazing the other one seemed fine when I
applied them on my hand there was no
streakiness at all only things so the
liquid lips except the purple or jeffree
star approved the only things that were
not quite up to par for me was of course
the wicked liquid lip and then the
wisteria highlighter girl this was a
flop for me this is not approved I
definitely had to put a different
highlighter on top of it for a pop but
of course you know my standards of
highlighting and this was not it but the
other ones that are reprimanded are
definitely great so overall we got a lot
of hits and a few misses so hopefully
you guys got something out of this video
if you want to purchase anything now you
know what the fuck is up and you know
what to buy so thanks for watching guys
and I will see you on the next one mwah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
