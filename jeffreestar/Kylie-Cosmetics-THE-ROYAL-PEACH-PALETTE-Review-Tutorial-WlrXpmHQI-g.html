channel
I am ready to get in just a makeup
tutorial it is the new year so I thought
you know what just celebrate in the new
year and just start off this year with a
bang I am going to try out the new Kylie
cosmetics the royal peach palette now
when I saw this packaging on her
snapchat I was like oh okay like the
bitches coming in for the New Year's I'm
playing games so I was really excited
when Kylie's team dropped this palette
off at my house I'm like thank you girl
I love a little exclusive first of all
this packaging let's just talk about the
packaging because it is gorgeous so
already I'm like okay and when it opened
the box and saw this I was like yes I
got to say one thing I know you guys
can't feel this palette through your
phone or computer but it's heavy it's
nice like it is good packaging I guess I
mean that's what I got to say right away
is that I was really impressed with
everything so this is the unit card and
of course it says the name of the
palette at the top beautiful eyes I'm
going to assume these are Kylie's eyes
of course and this makeup look is cute I
got a little inspired by the front I'm
like okay let me try my version so on
the back of course it says Kylie pressed
powder eyeshadows it has all the shade
names there are 12 shades and all the
names are on the back they're also on
the back of the palette which I love of
course the ingredients are all listed
down below and the normal info now as
soon as you open up the palette beome it
is heavy it is all white with the rose
gold Kylie logo which I love it's very
in-your-face let's open it up now when
you open it BAM there is a huge mirror
right there there is also a makeup brush
which as you can tell I used in the
video today and the brush was good you
guys it was not like shitty now that I
expected it to be but like you know a
lot of times brushes that come with
palettes or a little plastic a little
kind of like
don't really blend that well but this
one worked amazing so you have all 12
colors right here of course the ones
that stood up to me wore beautiful royal
blue the green and of course all of the
peachy type shades now at the end of the
video I will be giving my final thoughts
but a lot of people were like is this
comparable or like the two-faced sweet
peach pout that of course everyone knows
about it's different obviously the color
scheme is way different in my opinion of
course going to be different formula
different everything but um is this one
better or worse than the sweet peach
palette you'll have to watch a little
bit towards the end to hear that final
thought now with this video I will not
be swatching them all like I've done in
the past I just created a look I think
there are so many swatches on snapchat
and Instagram and Twitter that you guys
have probably have already seen the
colors but of course do they work and of
course you want to see how they look on
the damn eyes so that is what today's
the video will be also used a brand new
highlighter that you know maybe this
little hole right here we'll be putting
out next month so you guys will get a
little sneak peek at a new shade because
hi it's 2017 there's a lot rolling out
with every single person and I can't
wait to share everything with you guys
so if you want to see how I created this
peach goddess look then keep on watching
alright guys so I just prime my lids
with a little Mac painterly paint-pot so
we are ready to roll I decided to do my
brows foundation and contour today just
so we could really focus on the palette
I think we are ready to dive right into
it now I haven't even fingers watched
this palette yet so this is brand new of
course you guys have seen this all over
the internet Kylie has been sneak
peeking it all over Instagram and her
snapchat I honestly don't know what type
of look I'm gonna do today I'm just
gonna pop a little transition shade in
my crease and I guess see what happened
so I think just start off I'm just going
to also this palette has a brush so let
me take the brush up rooo right now so I
might utilize that today maybe I'll just
use that right away and see if it's any
good now I've never used her brushes
before I know she came out with some
during the holiday collection I never
got to use them life has been too
fucking busy so
I'm just going to who this was it's that
bad you know it's crazy this looks like
the new morphe brushes that just dropped
so similar this is slightly more gold
and this is a little more rose gold but
I'm like oh my god they're really
similar so I'm going to start with a
sorbet right here it is a really soft I
think this is a transition shade really
easy for the crease and we're just going
to saturate and coat our brushes so
we're just going to take this and let's
pop her right in the crease and see what
happens
now this color you know these these
peachy sort of colors are always gonna
look good on really any skin tone which
I find very helpful for anyone that
wants to recreate this look or try their
own little spin on it alright now we're
going to take a little Mac two one seven
brush and we're going to dip into shade
peachy now this one was really pretty
it's called a sorbet I don't know if I
said that the first time sorbet is a
very easy neutral color it blended into
the crease perfectly so we're just going
to dip into here and add a little bit
more into the crease
all right tell me why this peachy shade
is everything it's almost like a bright
coral like as amazing payoff the pigment
is great now I've only use two colors so
far so you know obviously y'all know
what it is I'm just gonna keep going on
as I go and just give you guys my you
know first impressions right when I use
them and this one is so pretty I'm
looking in the mirror like oh my god yes
all right now this shade at the bottom
right is called a cinnamon it is a more
darker peachy dirty color and I'm gonna
go in with this little Cosette brush it
is a fine a little detailer blender
brush and we're just going to saturate
our brush with this and then we're just
gonna pop this right in the crease
alright so now I'm gonna go back in with
that color peachy and just take this
brush and go in on my lower lash line
and really smoke it out
so I looks very heroin-chic now I got to
give it up for these matte shades I
haven't tried any of the shimmers yet
but like this formula is really really
nice so now I'm going to take a smaller
brush this is from the morphe rose gold
collection that just dropped and to get
into that you know right in our inner
inner corner I'm just going to use a
smaller brush it's easier and you won't
cause a mess
all right now before I do any more
eyeshadows I'm just going to quickly pop
in some Mac smolder eye pencil in my
inner corner we're going to use that as
a tool to smudge out and add a pop of
blue in a minute y'all thought I wasn't
going to dip into that blue shadow if
you cut the wrong one I'm sure a lot of
you are wondering why the hell I'm using
a dry Beauty Blender to pull down my eye
it is because I don't like when any
people pull and tug all over your eyes
because guess what in five or 10 years
I'm crow's feet you're going to hit you
like a fucking brick and you're going to
be like damn I shouldn't have like
pulled my eyes so tight remember the
skin around your eyes is so much more
sensitive than the rest of the skin on
your face
so I like to take this and literally
just that's it that tiny movement is
going to help put this in there without
pulling and tugging the ice and that's
it one two and that is done all right
now before we do anything down below I'm
going to finish off in here now you
could leave this blank if you want
there's not really like a really light
shimmer shade in the palette I think
that's my only concern is like what am I
going to put right in there I'm thinking
this like olive green metallic though
because why the hell not let's get
colorful everybody so I'm going to take
a little pencil brush any pencil brush
will do I'm going to use this little Mac
one and you know you can use this
probably with fix+ to intensify it but
let's just see how it is by itself first
okay so these ones have a little bit
more fallout than the matte ones I'm
just going to tell you that right now
just from looking at it on the brush so
I'm just going to shake that off a
little bit and then let's try to tuck it
in the inner corners
Wow okay I'm pleasantly surprised not
that I thought it was gonna be awful or
anything it's just in the past her
shimmer shadows haven't really impressed
me the matte ones are always like but
the frost you know shimmer shades are a
little but this shade and this one is
called mojito um forgot to mention that
sorry I am really happy of how this
applied usually when I put shimmer
shades in the inner corner or right here
over because remember we're putting this
over a matte shade as well they don't
really work that well but I'm like oh
I'm a little shook right now because
this looks really stunning moving along
I think I really want to dip into the
blue even though these contacts are
fucking like screaming bright blue I
think it would be fun to add in a little
blue I think in here just like you know
very subtle I'm not gonna go ham now I'm
gonna go in with a little Cosette
detailing brush I'm just gonna dip into
the blue now the blue shade is called
royal okay and I am just going to go in
there Oh Oh with one swipe the brush is
coated okay girl alright so since we
already have that black liner laid down
in the waterline I'm just gonna take
this brush and I'm just gonna lightly go
in so I'm gonna be really careful it's
almost like we're doing surgery and I'm
just gonna put that right under the
liner
oh right royal shadow definitely
impressed me like this shit went on
super easy I'm like oh my god alright
now before I finish this look I'm gonna
add in a little bit more of this just on
the lash line to kind of buff and blend
it out but I am loving this I look so
far of course we're gonna do mascara and
lashes quickly but I was thinking of any
other color I could incorporate this
look with but I mean it's pretty fucking
good so I don't really see any other
colors I could use on the eye right now
so I'm going to go back in with that
little Kylie brush and we're gonna go
back in with peachy and I'm just going
to smoke this out a little more you guys
know I like the drama so if this is too
much for you you can skip this part but
I'm just going to kind of buff and just
so that blue and Peach have like a real
marriage here now I think it's
definitely time for some mascara benefit
is my mother fucking shit but I'm gonna
go in with this elf mascara because I
use it the other day and it was fucking
amazing so we're gonna go in with this
guy I'm really loving this wand and
brush so I am going to cheat on benefit
today and try this out so let's get to a
all right mascara is done now I'm gonna
quickly pop on some lashes and I'll be
right back
lashes are on I used the Lilly ghalichi
lashes in style tease they are really
cute love how thick they are on the like
outer edges I'm like yes girl hi the
last few things that we need to do are
highlighting and lips and do I have a
surprise for y'all today because we're
going to use two highlighters one of
them you guys already know but I think
to keep the whole peach theme of the
palette in this tutorial I am going to
dip into the jeffree star cosmetics skin
frost in shade peach goddess but then I
have a brand new shape that I'm gonna
put on top of it and I'm gonna let y'all
motherfuckers have it so let's do this
first and then I'll show you my little
surprise now you guys know what I don't
need to tell you how much of a
highlighting whore I am I like to take
this and go all the way up and even go
above the brow a little bit just to
create a little bit of shimmer and
dimension to the face
alright now I'm going to dip into a
skinned frog shade that launches in
February it is brand new and it is in
the gold family so if you love King Tut
and so fucking gold you are going to
love this shade now the goal is kind of
look a little similar in the pan but
they are so different on the skin I got
a lot of feedback that King Tut was a
little too dark and bronzy for a lighter
skin tone it was just a little too dark
so I created a beautiful stunning hot
gold shade and this is called Siberian
gold
I've been trying it the last few weeks
and I am obsessed with it so I'm going
to take this brush and I'm just gonna go
right in here and I'm gonna hit the
Cupid's bow so you guys can see how
pretty it is and then we're gonna put it
over peach goddess because who just
wants to wear one highlighter yeah oh
yes it looks like you took a little
glass of gold milk and took a sip yes
and now I'm going to take this and put
it down my nose because I want to be
blinding today oh yeah I want to be
blinding today alright now I'm going to
take Siberian gold and put it right over
peach goddess for an extra but light up
but sorry I'm trying to say blinding but
my voice is just like I was speechless
for MINIX it was so pretty okay
umm these two together though I'm sorry
you like how I keep putting on more
because I really need highlighting a
rehab alright I think the only place
that I need highlighting is a little bit
right here because why the fuck not
bitch
alright highlighting is done now let's
get to the lips her lips today we're
going to start off with a little
Charlotte Tilbury Hot Lips
now you guys know what Kim K Debbie was
one of my favorites from last year but
damn this new one this is called miss
Kings inton and oh my god mmm it's a
darker nude but uh-oh
excuse me but this this is the one
all right I am loving this lip color it
is perfect for this look but I want a
little bit of shine a little bit of
gloss type of effect so I'm going to go
in with the joy lip topper this is in
shade a skinny dip and if you guys
haven't tried these out before what are
you waiting for
so I only focus a product on the center
of the mouth just so it gives it a
little bit more volume and a little
luminous look and yeah I'm not gonna put
it on the outer edges and I think this
look is almost complete now where's my
damn thang spray alright for setting
spray today I'm going to go in with my
favorite Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray but cool thing is they just
revamped their packaging they also
launched a bunch of new skin stuff which
I can't wait to put in some future
videos but look at the new all nighter
packaging yes it is like a black full
matte black with lavender font and I'm
living in case you guys need a little
reminder this is the old packaging kind
of miss the big UD at the top but hey
it's the same formula so are we ready
let's get to setting are we done yet
fuck no we're not
alright this look is complete this is
the final look now listen I'm going to
give you my final thoughts on the royal
peach palette from Kylie cosmetics now I
am really pleasantly surprised not that
we haven't had a good experience with
the bronze palette and the burgundy
palette because those were sickening now
sadly I didn't do a review on the
holiday collection because listen last
year towards the end it was getting
really hectic didn't have enough time so
I thought you know what I better hop on
this book in peach palette real quickly
so I'm gonna say I'm just gonna say it
and a lot of people are gonna be like oh
my god you're so shady you're so this
you're so that I've heard all I don't
give a fuck I'm gonna be a hundred
percent honest I prefer the Kylie
palette way more than the Too Faced
sweet peach palette yes I said it slap
me across my mouth read me to Phil I
don't give a fuck the sweet peach
palette I thought was is cute and I did
it to Tori
way back in April when it first launched
and it sold out so I will link that
tutorial down below but I just feel like
this has more variety for creating looks
there wasn't like 20 shades of Browns
which to face is very infamous for
putting like a million Browns it's like
we've seen that over and over so I was
really excited for this that all had
tone though that Mohito shades slayed me
now the matte formulas were stunning
obsessed love it not a lot of fall out
my face looks great eyes turned out
beautiful I'm really happy with this
palette so I think if you should get any
palette that she's put out so far this
is the one so I am very excited to see
what she comes out with a next bitch you
killed this one alright I mean the final
result is the Royal Peach palette it's
Geoffrey start brew baby I mean I don't
even think I need to tell you guys that
you should know by now the way these
blend it out I'm like bitch the stamp of
approval is on this palette so hopefully
a lot of you guys will get to check this
out I think it is definitely just
something fun to have in your kit and
I'm living alright I will see you on the
next video umm yeah I don't even know
what else to say I'm I'm fucking I'm
ready to go hit the club and suck a dick
so ma love you guys mmm bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
