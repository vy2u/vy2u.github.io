channel now today I'm gonna be diving in
and doing a first impressions on the new
Kylie cosmetics the burgundy palette now
you guys know I loved the first one so
when I saw these color hues and this
color story I was like yes because I
love Reds and I love Burgundy's and I
just love bronze tone shadows this is
what she looks like
of course the same drips as before but
this one has burgundy and pink and like
topaz tears and the other one of course
matched that palette so should we open
her up but it looks something like this
now I think the color hues of this
palette speak to me a little more than
the first one I can definitely play
around with this more and I love rusty
colors I love Burgundy's I love the
transition colors in this palette now
this palette is $42 and I know that
Kylie said on snapchat that her next
palette after this one would have a
mirror so I know what everyone's going
to be asking but this one does not have
a mirror and which I don't care I get
ready in my studio or on a vanity
everyday with a mirror so I don't really
ever use palettes and use the mirror
maybe that's just me but I know a lot of
people on the go and I do want to mirror
so this one does not have it now of
course these are just my thoughts and
opinions remember I've been a makeup
artist for 15 years I create my own
formulas and I am very educated in the
beauty world so of course people are
going to run their mouth and say
whatever they want about my thoughts but
hey I always keep a hug bitch so let's
get to some swatching and let's get to
playing alright this is the first shade
naked and of course excuse my broken
nail I have a new dog and he loves to
chew on things and so you see has that
really soft pretty shimmer to it
horse have tattoos so this is not going
to show up like it would on blank skin
and but here is the second shade of
beech it is a pretty brown warm really
nice transition shade and here is the
third shade is called penny it is a
really warm orange color BAM
what penny looks like next shade is
called la it is a really pretty frosty
shade I think Shibley up the formula in
her frost because this one is super
pigmented and it is banging fifth shade
is called burgundy it is a beautiful
warm red color and I lived for this one
and the sixth shade is called Dubai it
is a pretty frosty rusty red color and I
lived for this one it is definitely way
more pigmented than the last frost
shades from the bronze palette and I
live the seventh shade is called brick
it is a reddish tone Brown really pretty
BAM the next shade is called New York
this is a more deep bronzy color really
gorgeous and of course it is a frost
formula and the last shade is called
almond it is a really pretty warm tone
dark brown and it is matte of course now
I had a little bit of lotion on my
finger so I'm just going to add a little
bit more all right so here are all the
swatches now let's dive in and put some
on my eyes now we're going to be priming
the eyes with the Mac painterly
paint-pot of course if you have a
favorite primer that you love now is the
time to apply and get ready to blind so
when I do these primers I like to take
it from my lid all the way up almost to
the lash line because I'm a sick bitch
I'm gonna pop a little transition color
into my crease with this little Bobby
Brown blending brush and I'm going to be
using shade Beach which is the top
middle shade so I'm just gonna pop this
guy right in here of course this is
going to help us blend out all of our
darker shades lighter and just blend
ever Leslie there we go girl
I forgot to speak English for a minute
now right away just from blending it is
good and I'm just going to take this and
kind of go like this and kind of stop it
here so normally y'all used to me going
all the way down I'm just going to keep
this right here today and leave some
room for some other shades and because I
have no brows I'm going to drag it a
little
of course if you are not me or jenna
Marbles try shaving off your brows all
right now I know there's going to be a
lot of questions about the pigmentation
how they blend now this first color
blended really quick and amazing so
let's keep moving on now I'm going to be
using shade penny which is the top right
one and it is a warm orange color which
I you know I love a good little orange
transition and I'm just going in with a
little Mac two to one brush and we are
just going to pop this into the crease
and start adding some dimension and
definition come on now now see how I'm
just going to take this and stop it here
again and we're just gonna go slightly
down no this is just add a little more
warmth to the lid and the crease I'm
gonna be going in with a little Sigma e
five seven brush now I don't know if I'm
gonna wet the brush with fix+ yet it
might not need it so I'm just going to
go in here a few times oh okay okay
might not need any help girl and
I'm just going to do packing motions and
go on my lash line all right now I'm
gonna merge dubai with the other colors
and we're just gonna pack this in and of
course we're gonna blend it it out
better later but we're gonna just lay
down the foundation of our luck all
right now a lot of the times with these
colors there's a lot of fallout because
of just a shade in the pigment but this
is pretty good you guys my cheeks are
not dusted and I'm just packing this in
really heavy and bam all right the lids
are looking rusty and I love it now I'm
gonna be going in with this deep topaz
bronze color it's called la yes shout
out to Calabasas what's up Los Angeles I
love the shade name okay so I'm going to
be taking this guy and taking it all the
way down to here and just kind of giving
it a little moment to just you know
blind and my life so I'm gonna
be using this little shader brush and
sometimes I like to wet the brush to
really intensify metallics but okay
let's see what happens with this guy
now this one feels really creamy already
on the brush I haven't touched it with
my finger but it feels really nice and
it's blending into the other shadows um
pretty great alright now we're gonna go
in with the bottom right shade this one
is called almond it is a dark chocolate
brown with a warm undertone and I'm
gonna be going in with that same Mac two
to one brush now I love these because
the last one had a lot of kick back and
was a little more powdery this one I
think is a little more fine-tuned and
the formula I think already just from
playing with them is slightly better I
think the last palette was still fine
and you know there's so many mixed
reviews people are just crazy in general
I think a lot of people seek out and
want to hate something but so far so
good and I'm loving how these are
blending so I'm gonna take that shade
almond and we're just going to lightly
place it in the outer crease area just
to darken my eye socket and give it some
fall drama now I'm gonna be taking that
same Bobbi Brown blending brush and
we're gonna go back into beach just ever
so slightly and now we're just going to
go over what we did earlier and just
kind of drag it and blend it out just so
it's a little more soft and dramatic
just soften dramatic work together is
that is that a term I think so
alright now I think I want to smoke up
my entire bottom lashes with the middle
shade of Burgundy I think this is the
star of the palette if you will I'm just
going to be going in with the Tom Ford a
little pencil brush and I'm gonna do
liner in a second but I just kind of
want to smoke this out and see how it
looks
I'm just gonna really gently drag it
across my whole entire under eye and
just try to smoke this bitch out oh wow
this is like really creamy like when I
say smooth it glides on and shockingly
enough just because I've had bad
experiences with other brands usually
there's a lot of red fallout but this
one you know and I am flicking the brush
but it's pretty good we're gonna go back
in with this guy and dip into that
almond shade and I'm just gonna kind of
blend them together and let them merge
they are now having a baby or they're
dating alright guys this is
is coming together I'm really loving the
smoky red eye look it's cool now I am
wearing green contact lenses today to
give it a little extra right right right
I think my brown eyes definitely could
have worked but I just kind of want an
extra little you know just little pizazz
if you will all right now for the last
time we're gonna be dipping into shade
Beach again and I'm just going to be
dragging out this now I love to drag my
eyeshadows out I love a dramatic eye I
know a lot of people are like yeah I
just love the effect of a really just
beautiful smoky eyes so I'm just gonna
drag out the colors and bam all right
now for the waterline I'm gonna be using
this little Smith 2:02 brush look I'm
attorney that is I'm like girl and I'm
going to be using the Tarte black clay
pot liner so we're just going to be
dipping into this ever so slightly it is
really creamy and really pigmented just
how I like it and I'm gonna be taking a
little Beauty Blender to hold down to my
eye and we're just gonna tuck this in
our waterline
alright
BAM a liner is done now usually I love
to take a pencil liner and Willy make it
so dramatic on the bottom but I want
this red burgundy color to just live and
breathe and die because I love how it
looks now I definitely think there needs
to be some shimmer or something else
below the brow so I'm gonna be trying
this top shade it's called naked it is a
shimmery it looks almost like a beige
type of color so hopefully it's not too
dark for my skin tone but I just kind of
wanted to add a little bit below the
brow just for a little lost shimmer now
I'm so used to putting like stark white
colors below the brow that I actually
don't mind this it looks cool so I'm
only doing it from here I'm not gonna
take it all the way in I just started
from right here and I'm just gonna blend
and merge those colors together all
right now I think I'm gonna have to go
in with this guy again and I'm just
gonna buff and make those colors
seamless this is coming together nicely
you guys I'm feeling the fall fantasy
all right I think the only thing missing
is of course some lashes so I'm going to
start off by applying my
roller mascara roller lash if you will
now this has been my tried and true for
a long time and let's get to it all
right now before I apply a lashes yeah
we got to go old-school Jeffrey star and
I think it's time to hit the roast court
and just have a moment all right now for
lashes I'm gonna be using the what the
 am I gonna be using today you guys
I think I'm gonna go in with the velour
lashes this is the new style and I'm the
dumb bitch that of course forgot the
name of it so I know these just launched
and I've been obsessed with them for a
minute so I'm just gonna pop these on
and I'll be right back alright lashes
are on I'm loving it now I think the
only thing I need to complete this look
even though this is not a tutorial I
need a lipstick right so I'm
gonna be going in with the blush nude
from Tom Ford one of my ultimate
favorites BAM she's worn down girl and
let's just finish this look
all right the lips are done I think a
classic nude lip for this dramatic eye
is perfect but of course if you want to
do green black blue or red please feel
free because who the hell am I to ever
say to not be even more creative because
you all know I love some crazy but I
think the last final step is I have this
new refreshing makeup fix makeup spray
from Armani I got it today and I'm like
you know what we have to try this right
now this is the Armani Prima okay girl
now allegedly this is supposed to set
your face to filth and hopefully um your
makeup doesn't come off so let's give it
a whirl oh my god it sprays out a lot
thank you Jesus all right this face is
set baby but I need some hair so I'll be
right back all right guys this is the
final look had to add some cotton candy
hair and I am feeling the fantasy of the
Burgundy palette now final thoughts this
palette is great I know so many people
are gonna want to hate and be crazy and
I know there's so many of you that love
Kylie and you're like yes another
amazing product from her so this video
is of course just my experiences it
blended amazing the formula was great I
think the only shadow I wasn't obsessed
with was the far top one it is a little
more sheer than the rest but I remember
Kylie saying that on snapchat she want
it to be a little more subdued so it's
not a negative it's just personally I
like really rich pigments I think that
she really improved the formula from the
last palette even though I was a fan of
that one I think that this one is better
and that's just my opinion
so I think it's awesome that she is
improving the formulas and working on
everything and definitely going to be
using this and I love that it's you know
perfect for travel it's a cute little
light size so I think this is really
good for going to Kmart back to school
being on your knees but Nova real I
think that this look is a really
stunning and I want to see you guys
create it so find some reds and
burgandy's and get to work baby thank
you guys so much for watching this I
hope you enjoyed some makeup and some
first impressions
and I'll see you on the next one no I'm
not
I am effort blah blah blah oh come on
penny let's get in that grease</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
