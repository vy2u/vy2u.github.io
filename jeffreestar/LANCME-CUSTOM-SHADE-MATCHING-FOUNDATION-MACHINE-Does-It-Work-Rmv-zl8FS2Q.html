channel today i am with jasmine she is
the head of artistry of a lancome for
education and worth today we're New York
City headquarters oh yeah
so where's the headquarters today and
snowing outside without a sign not much
snow the peridot so basically you guys I
am really excited today because we are
going to test out the custom foundation
machine but what is the official name
the topper to come here yes and this
went viral you guys I know most of you
have already seen is all over Instagram
on snapchat on Twitter so many people
tagged me and they were like Jennifer
you have to test out this machine now
the technology is amazing what we're
going to talk about that in a second so
for ever and a home that is wondering
where they can test out the machine
because I know it's fairly new so it's
slowly popping up right where can we
Monday so right now they can be found in
Nordstrom doors at 11:00
select doors within the country and to
find that those doors you can go into
Lancome - us they got ok kinda looks
cool and if you guys have any questions
or where to find it everything will be
linked down in the description box below
so what was it today we're going to
match the shoe in exact match we are
going to match the what's so special
about what on particular is that it
really does give you your customized
when we scan through any areas of your
favorite skin jumper yes so what you
love about your skin tone those are the
areas that we can we need three scans to
completely and get your my guide and so
there will only be one match that's
yours and it will come up with an
amazing complexion ID that will be
unique to Justice are cool yeah so I can
have some light makeup on today they're
all going to reveal so which is actually
don't wipe it off so we get an exact
match
you can't match foundation arjan that's
absolutely devastating the word is so
what's so great is that we are able to
scan again any areas of the state that I
mean any area that you love it's really
all about the calculation of those
different skin tones kind of create your
one to price-match that's amazing okay
cool well we're going to get started and
let's will write me down so I'm excited
on the mall alright so I'm just going to
push this hair back and we're going to
remove this ten layers
all right good for you like I know what
do we need to remove probable presence
there it's actually for all skin types
and it really does an amazing job losing
any and all makeup so when you don't
want to rush you know immediate or
pacifier alright Rebecca credit
consultation I've never been scared
before this is so what's the great about
this system also on Jeffery just so you
know it's customizable based on your
skin type in your beverage preference
the notes of formulas are like okay you
can change the coverage absolutely we
can do the presentation type very well
we are going to create your profile
cannot discriminate and so you are going
to come your skin type dry normal point
and then your coverage class okay so
let's start what you can do I am on
please I have normal skin I'm never
really a eautiful King oh thank you I
think maybe lived in California it's
just I don't know whether I don't know
what is but like my skin just always
normal so she never getting a gene good
days yeah
really normal and then coverage you know
we don't roll this particular formula
will end up as a natural finish the
world that seconds can finish and avail
the perfection of a 6-under filter
needed yeah these are good okay so we're
going to go home and that is our skank
so jealous keypad to start the scanning
yes what I need from you is I need you
to look into the mirror with me okay I
want you to show me any areas and you
love to match when buying a foundation
so where are there the tools that you
love the most
okay and we will need three okay so
we'll do this side of a cheek love this
area anything and then I select my neck
sometimes a little lighter so maybe
we'll do here okay and then I see we'll
do it before that area perfect yeah so
you're not going to find space that's
more flat surface like hero versus
whatever
alrighty so we are going to start with
more okay
scanning in and capturing that very
precise measurements that will give you
the overall once we're done so we'll let
you know like it's a good read or not
yeah so when I scan if I get those
things like echoes and if there's
anything that kind of Canon distort the
actual calculation over just cool okay
isn't it alright so here we have a
perfect reef
we get a green good remember for this
okay and then the reverse of what okay
so we come to this amazing page which I
think people have done be fascinated by
because very few people know what the
undertone is but that's a huge question
out there especially for our foundation
customers right and consumers
underground they don't and honestly if
you know it doesn't you don't learn that
overnight to something in school you
have read very into makeup you should do
anything that was going what is your
entree so when you look at this page
this is the page that actually tells you
how much because I know that we said
this at the beginning but it takes four
colors to make any foundation of this
system can calculate in this type of
twenty thousand shape Wow you know
there's so many people out there that
have such a hard time finding their yeah
you know their foundation colors
that's like lleana me like a lot of
other brands have so few selections I'll
see a brand come out with a new
foundation and there's like eight colors
on my girl oh yeah every three under
trial every undertone so you know it's
involvements definitely there I mean
with this particular system on it is
unlimited to the people that we can
match so if everyone has a recognizable
competition here you can actually see
that how much revenue have seniors
formula how much yellow how much black
and how much white which I think you
look pretty
you'll probably never need another
number together cause we have never seen
it and it also shows where you I want to
scale as far as normally people were
cool
I'm ecology neutral and I can tell by
the cooking and you with a little
redness that comes through really enough
I know that's what we don't want us to
capture we want to but you definitely
land in the neutral area another can see
we said hum normal so it's added butcher
honester I'm lost inner battle comrade
said pretty much counselors overall
quality
so what what spinner dude we've been out
the formula to make it more sheer
provide people correct exactly so if you
were to tell me that you want to share
and they would the category shear never
battles are going to slap
right haha
we will continue here has already good
length so yeah so now we're going to
make your foundation and so exciting for
me I was going to hold this up market
but I've seen this so many times online
is so exciting so basically it's going
to give my own label right with my name
on it off serial number for now I can
always go back and they can remake it
without going to the process right but
in the system forever your the system
forever
your models will have the complexion IV
that will be pulled up any or charm a
big we're 30 seconds on stage so we
start with our little plastic bottle
right oh wow okay and that's the
programmable time watching I'm always
like I can't tell you how many
volunteers closed yes and watching it is
always like the first time for me
because you see only Sigma stopping yeah
so right now it's terrific the Penguins
approximate with unprecedented accuracy
basements I can't believe it you know
that makes my skin tone so crazy
oh wow there goes the resignation fine
that was all of the pigments have
dropped and that half the bottle is full
with pigment okay and moisturizer the
reason for that is because it's
adjustable so if I knock you and say you
know sometimes people think about their
perfect maximum is taken once sugar a
little darker right and so we can
accompany HR we can make it brighter
more molecules of the bullet extra we
holding initially and have a say go I
trust 100% the accuracy level yeah well
when you said it's gonna give you your
perfect mattress is very cool but if you
have the clients are happy right then
they will do whatever they have
cool so Chuck we here is your evolution
crazy Wow so the min accessory is
shaking it is we're going to blend it
all together all these amazing shinny
we're going to put into our shaker and
this is where it yeah this is all very
philosophically manager at home start
working well these are really good Wow
already looks like my screen no that's
crazy okay so we're gonna freaking let's
take a piece Wow all blended saw
Wednesday I don't know what the good
life is enough so you'll see little vein
you'll see you can turn on them so if
you give it a fresco and it doesn't
blend enough and you see kind of like
this little white Binnington yes give it
another go some foundations depending on
how much red and how much yellow isn't
reflected in there a may need a little
bit more focus but you'll find that the
foundation color from the bottle is
sometimes not what people expect
okay that's a little lighter than I was
like I said this was there used to
something out right and for because of
it this formula wants to put onto the
skin okay it's put a blend in in the
magic act and so you'll see it when they
do see it or tentative trip dollars
completely cuz then I go that's too
light that's how my color oh that's too
floral injure you really think the
public under target practice is employed
okay so it has a little kids have before
they had the foundation and we're going
to start with our genifique now a funny
story 11 using this for a few years now
on
and I love it so we're going to start to
eat okay we're going to add a little bit
of champagne and it's exactly it has SPF
so that's the reason power on the
publicly there is have no SPF so this
has an SPF 30 kind it's a pretty basic
moisturizer all skin type and it's more
of a little shim than it is a cream I'm
excited to try so we're actually to the
third step before on these dense is
wholly great the out of primer right it
affects the skin beautifully commented
is our smoothing effect oil-free the
bottom primer and it's amazing cool a
little oil free action telling incident
the area that you could typically get
oily okay commonly like a little bit I
get shiny in my nose a little bit of
t-zone area people are going to watch
that are perfect match and then I will
blended in this poppy and I will do half
of the face so that you can really see
the comparison Alexis the electorate and
what a beautiful valid is can you tell
right away that if we could match
actually if you look at it how visually
it's a lot like okay and then at this
end I'm the presidency what happens when
this is actually be young preferred
method of application moralistic
emotions because it has a skinny finish
right here in a blender but you want to
blend it out and what is it brush I've
never used before
this is a kind of brush that was created
for this particular product and what's
great about the brushes that you have
this other opportunity to get into the
places that are a little bit more than
the secret all the lesson planning are
you nervous
all right whoa so I'm really you know I
do have some discoloration which people
don't think I don't up close I promise I
do and I mean it's like literally
canceled out like everything it looks
very natural
I'm I'm looking side by side comparison
and it looks beautiful
the mask pretty spot on like I don't
know what to expect and it's not like
too dark it's not too light it's
literally
lovely and sir yeah like a romantic
honestly I mean I'm so they can see to
right to the trouble
it really has just created this amazing
veil of coverage like coverage not super
full coverage so again that's can I see
your skin yeah what kind of good of an
average day like when I go to the mall
or I'm going out these are some normal
hair and I don't want to wear ten laters
as I'm auditioning concealer so this is
a good everyday moment I feel like I'm
like shot down it's like how do you say
it doesn't feel heavy it's really light
like I really feel like there's nothing
on my how to feel /i weightless on it's
crazy I'm like running shot that it
doesn't feel like anything so super
lightweight super lightweight as a
water-based formula so there's nothing
to having your name easy I'm like not
Oprah even you out happy - real yeah it
looks beautiful now what we were just
saying off-camera everybody is that this
is so perfect for like the average girl
that does not have an hour every morning
to get ready this is perfect for going
to the office going to school it's
neutralized
everything I'm feeling flawless it's
very I still think it over the
lightweight it's like I'm that public
said that 20 times right now but it
feels like I still just have more
shredder on like it feels amazing
because it gives you that fit that fresh
feeling yeah for the entire time of your
warning that's so cool yeah so it's
actually beautiful
yes so what's the next step so and I
said that we are going to personalize
your bottles let me tell me what you
would like your label to be use with the

everyone I'm always going to be asking a
few questions so what is the retail
price for something like this
eighty dollars but that includes a full
consultation okay sell the complication
so you get the skin you get someone
explaining everything you get the full
consultation inexperienced yeah it is
Pacific more experience so cool and to
end up with your perfect match I mean
for many women I can say that for myself
as well over the Tina's very hard
community honesty its crisis yes
experience is priceless when you end up
with a perfect match and I think that
foundation is an investment I see a lot
of people at home mixing all the time
they're buying several things or just
doesn't really work for them I see a lot
of people buy things and then it doesn't
