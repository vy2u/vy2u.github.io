channel it has been a long few weeks me
and Nathan just actually got back from
Paris a few days ago we got really
deathly ill I think from all the
traveling we are in New York prior to
that and the jet lag was extreme for us
I got a severe head cold the day after
we had this really huge fashion show to
go to which by the way we filmed a lot
of our Paris trip so I'm gonna put that
any video later after the weekend it was
really fun besides being really freezing
it actually snowed one morning and I was
like oh okay Paris is nicely snow there
so besides that today actually I have
really good news because my jeffree star
cosmetics custom dye hoodies are finally
back in stock in case you guys are like

into this video I just want to give a
quick little announcement that I woke up

media so basically it is a bunch of

description box below and I'm really
excited to go to the awards show and see
everybody alright now for second time
be running my mouth and you want
to see me get into this highlighting
rose and keep on watching
alright y'all now you know I love review
and highlighters I've done a million
liquid lip swatches and I always get
like I always asked guys tag me in some
crazy anything new beautiful weird
crazy I want to review it so when this
Lancome olive Rose powder hit the
internet oh my god my Twitter feed my
comment section it might the ends were
full of this like everyone was like it
is finally in my hands of course I was
just in Europe so I didn't get to film
with it yet but as soon as I landed I'm
like okay girl we got to jump on this
this is allegedly a iridescent blush
highlighter okay so it's supposed to
give a little color that's the blush is
right so let me just give a little
lowdown of this product first of all
there's only one point six grams and
this still really light so before you
even open it I want to let you know like
girl this feels like so light I feel
like this on a soft yet brow is almost
heavier maybe it is heavier actually
girl okay so let's open this up and see
what we get it has the little horse
silver unicorn you open it up and it is
black inside and yes here is the main
event wow this feels really really
lightweight just gotta say that like
almost like air okay so it is a really
really pastel pink color you know I love
the pink and of course as a logo
right there on the bottom it just of
course has a product name again and
that's it so let's open it because here
is the eye porn this is the eye can this
is makeup Lauren scuse me
whoo alright so this would be top going
to put that down and here is the product
it is really cute I mean I'm just going
to say it right now it is a very
innovative I've also seen another brand
hold on I'm not blowing anyone in my no
tea no shade makeup tutorial from last
week I used this cameo blush it looked
like this now this same brand is
actually from Paris even though my
friend found it in Japan so this brand
must be worldwide right now they have
something that looks like this and this
is actually a blush so a lot of you were
like oh my god this is the first time
I've ever
seen anything like this and I agree it
is really cute very innovative but this
one let me just open this hi it's a
flower
I'm like okay now I'm not saying Lancome
stole the idea obviously people have
done a million things before I will say
that this one likes way more pretty I
guess it looks more cute to me now this
one I don't know if they're the first
bread to ever create something like this
maybe not I don't know I'm gonna have to
look that up in a second now I'm a
little stuffy because I have been sick
but I don't really smell anything okay
cool
so there is no instructions but I did go
on their website and there is a little
bit of information about the product so
before we even swatch this this is that
this rose is a beautiful delicate
collection that combines spring persian
pestel's with a hot make up trend on
highlighting okay bitch if this isn't
blindly about working out a problem
money it says get the latest on trend
glow looks or the most elegant and
vintage mythology encapsulated in the
fifties French inspired bourgeois box
traditionally meant to house loose
powder is a new generation highlighting
luminous powder the powder is evenly
dispersed amongst the rose petals okay
inside the box use a kabuki brush to
pick up the perfect amount of formula
for it perfect even glow okay well
obviously this does not come with a
kabuki brush I'm sure Lancome has one I
have so many pressures you guys I mean
wooden eyeliner brushes I'm going to
highlight so I picked up this Seurat
Beauty relief dense domed brush it feels
so soft I'm like hi besides this is a
how-to on the website so let's do this
together everybody it says gently swirl
the brush in a circular motion around
the rose petals to pick up the formula
then use the brush to apply on top of
the cheekbones center of the chin bridge
of the nose everywhere for added
highlight use your fingers to add the
powder under the brow or inner corner of
the eye so it once it's just a breath of
me eyes engage
alright so here is brush let's go for a
zoom in and see how much powder actually
even picks up on the brush and let's
still happen
Oh like pop back at me whoo it covered
the bristle you guys I'm like wow
okay I'm like hello let me do one more
little swirl okay now it is a fully
coated and let me just take a mirror and
let's do what happens
okay I'm just east y'all I'm like wait
wait wait where's the glow honey where's
the glow
I mean there's a little bit of shine
there we're talking like yeah a little
bit shiny my inner corner is like
actually a little bit of shines right
here ho okay I'm reading a little bit
more now it's not like it's there's like
zero pigment there is a little bit of
pigment we can all see it right there
right no tea no shade honey maybe I mean
it's buildable I mean I don't think this
is supposed to be like a metallic
blinding from NASA outer space satellite
moment but I was expecting like a little
bit more like huh it's almost like baby
powder to like let me I'm going to touch
with my finger oh oh yeah it's very like
chalky powdery let's put this over my
tattoo and see what it looks like yeah
it's almost like baby powder and then
blend it out mmm
barely okay now the cheek now that I
look back and I'm like okay I mean I
just expect a little bit more intensity
but it's not like it's horrific it
actually did highlight a little bit it
looks pretty actually okay now let's do
a little comparison here is one side of
my face and then here is the other
there's definitely a difference not that
I thought this was like zero pigment
awful oh my god but like I think I
expected a little bit more blinding
moment like glitter moment craziness I
don't know I you know I always want to
look like the Tin Man
but yeah there is a difference now the
powder looks really pale on me so there
literally is only one shade so if you
are I don't know if you have like a
warmer skin tone a darker skin tone I
don't know how this is going to look
because I'm like really pale like hey is
that my color and this is like obviously
made my cheek bone writer and I think
almost wider like I keep saying like
baby powder or chalk but okay there's
definitely pigment it's obviously more
subtle I mean Lancome is not a crazy
brand that has you know green lipsticks
and blue
writers but first you guys you can tell
my face I was like girl what the
but the more that I apply this and the
more that I'm seeing it on my skin I'm
really enjoying it like it really it
looks great and like come on
Beautyblender okay you guys this was a
grander than I thought all right let me
of course use my finger and do one area
I kind of try to highlight all right if
there's a little bit of powder sugar my
nose we'll see what happens oh I think I
like it the least on my nose but
cheekbones and chin I'm like really
feeling it all right you guys um Wow I
think it's time to give my final thought
alright after playing around with us for
a few minutes I really got to say I am
pleasantly surprised now I'm someone
that if I see a negative or a bad review
on something I'm already going to think
like okay what am I going into this like
I'm not expecting it to be great so when
it actually does kind of work I am
pleasantly surprised so I mean um you
know there's no it's like claim that
this is supposed to be the most blinding
thing on earth I know a lot of people
were complaining online like oh my god
there's really not that much pigment I
will say that if you are someone that
loves to collect now I'm a makeup
collector myself I love anything with
really cool packaging but when I saw
this I immediately was like oh my god
this is going to look so pretty on my
vanity now this is $60 of course Lancome
is a obviously a little more of a luxury
brand it is not drugstore
now the packaging is cute I think it's I
mean it feels a little cheap like this
paper thing right here it's kind of
already coming up right here not the
best I think it could have been made a
little more maybe even in plastic or
something heavier so it was kind of like
a more heavy wow factor but if you don't
mind
something feeling light but of course I
don't matter but to me I like a the
product now of course inside is
beautiful
we've seen it all million times by now
it's stunning I love the rose it looks
very realistic which is what kind of
reeled me in in the beginning we know
what I initially tried it was I love the
pigment know the second swipe in and you
can see it glow it's obviously there's
something there is it blinding and
amazing and what I am obsessed with no
but not ever wants to look like that not
every once I glow for the gods but if
you do like a subtle pretty glow
from within look I think this is perfect
I'm actually praying for a gold version
because summer I would bathe my entire
face in matte because I love how it
looks over the foundation so I was
coming into this video a little
skeptical but I will say this the
Lancome highlighting blush Rose is
Jefferson era proof it is really cute
now of course if you want something a
little more crazy you got to go you got
to go swatch something else baby but
this is really pretty I think it's cute
it's awesome of course it is sold out on
their website not sure when it's going
to be back
I know Nordstrom carries it a lot of
other sites hopefully will carry it so
if you can get it I think you should I
think it's fun I'm also really excited
because guess what's coming next week
guys I am filming the swatch trivial
video for my androgyny eyeshadow palette
and shooting all the ads for the beauty
campaign so you guys will finally get to
see what is inside that damn pink box
alright thank you for watching this
video I love you guys Emma have an
amazing night or day wherever you are
and I'll see you on the next one so bye
