channel hi I'm in Italy where are you
today I'm in Bologna Italy we are here
for a huge trade show for my brand and
we're expanding jeffree star cosmetics
into the other regions of the world no I
can't ever sleep so I am going to test
out some makeup today and in particular
a new concealer that just hit the market
that everyone is talking about today we
are going to dive in into the new Laura
Mercier full coverage concealer now I
just got this in the mail I brought it
in my suitcase and I'm like bitch we're
in Italy let's talk about and let's
review some makeup we're also going to
do a wear test today so I am gonna apply
this concealer we're gonna talk about
the formula how it smells how it looks
how it wears and then we're gonna go
adventure out into the city and I'm
actually gonna go makeup shop while I
test out makeup and I'm gonna do another
video where I do a full face of using
only Italian makeup so if you want to
see some full coverage extravaganza keep
on watching so I am making sealer junkie
a concealer whore and whenever there's a
new formula that is on the market I got
to try it so Laura Mercier one of the
most consistent I think brands in
Sephora that I've tried where it's just
most of the stuff it's just consistently
good we're just kind of hard to find
because a lot of brands have so many
hits or misses lately I don't know what
the hell is going on in this beauty
industry but Laura Mercier is here she's
back and she has a new formula which is
called the flawless fusion ultra
longwear concealer girl that is a
mouthful and it comes in this box right
here it is the soft touch black unit
carton that most for stuff comes in very
standard Laura Mercier now on the box it
says that this formula has 0.23 fluid
ounces in it I think that's pretty
standard for a concealer and as you see
when we open the boxes up the concealers
look like this there is a lot of product
in here our packaging is always a very
minimalistic it's very simple which I
don't mind her brand is very like that
so I don't expect anything you know wild
or
you know it's just a very like clean and
I like it let's dive in here and find
out the realty on this formula and all
the facts so this formula does come in
twelve shades the shade range isn't that
bad okay it kind of is they definitely
need to do more Laura what's up girl the
price point for this is $28 retail which
i think is very standard for a more
high-end concealer now what is this
formula allegedly supposed to do let's
see what it says here this is a medium
to full coverage weightless concealer
that perfects hydrate and blurs with up
to 12 hours of crease resistant wear
okay I guess when we do our we're
testament go walk around and explore the
city we'll see if this really does hold
up so this formula is oil-free it's
derma logically tested is supposed to
give hydration all day hiding under eye
darkness facial imperfections it's gonna
give a natural finish are you sure if
it's full coverage but we'll see in a
second this is a concealer we know how
to put it on now and when I do reviews I
like to do one side with a beauty sponge
and one side with either finger as a
brush or something different just to see
how the formulas work with a wet sponge
versus something dry so I did get a lot
of feedback from you guys from my Vegas
hotel video you guys are like please
come closer if you're going to review
something so I really appreciate the
feedback and now we're about to punch in
really close and see if this concealer
this Geoffrey start approved or not so
we're gonna do this review a little
different than normal now hi We're
punched in you can see all my
imperfections we got discoloration we
got freckles we have a bit of veins
under here and we're gonna see how this
formula really performs so I thought why
would I want to do full foundation
before the concealer I think because
this is a review video I am gonna do
foundation but I wanted to concealer
first which we normally do not do on
this channel first of all I bought three
shades okay I bought shades one n2c and
one see you never know about anything
online
my girl just got a guess and pray that
it matches now I will say this one of
them I think will definitely be a match
one n looks a light enough for me but
the other two 1c is so peachy looking
and then to C is too dark so we're
definitely gonna have to go in with one
n today and I do want to kind of give my
skin a little bit of moisturizer so
we're gonna go in with the talkshow
water cream this is one of my new
favorites I know everyone has been
raving about it and I've never used a I
love torture products
but I've never really used this so I'm
just gonna go in with a little synthetic
brush and I don't know how much to put
on I don't want to be too hydrated or is
that even thing now I do like to do
moisturizer right under my eyes if you
or someone who has dried under eyes or
baking or setting powder makes you look
kind of cakey or crepey you really want
to hydrate under the eye and of course
you can use an eye cream use a light day
one you don't want a really heavy night
one because it's gonna make your
concealer and foundation maybe not look
as flawless as it normally would so
we're just gonna rub this into the skin
and get it ready for some makeup now for
the right side of my face I am going to
be applying it with a wet sponge and
today we're going to use the Vera Mona
cake in baked sponge I love this I
haven't used it in a while but we're
back is here and I love kind of
rediscovering and going through my
makeup drawers in my kit and seeing
things that I love two months ago and
kind of forgot about I think when you
review and try so much stuff you kind of
you know things get lost in the mix and
you forget some bomb-ass products so I
don't know if anyone out there has tried
this if you have girl you know what I'm
talking about
okay cool guys so let's take this
concealer we're going to do this side of
course with the very mona sponge and
let's just apply it like how I normally
would so this is what the wand looks
like it is a flat looking little moment
and I'm just gonna do it how I normally
would so we're gonna definitely do the
under eyes and we do one two three it
doesn't matter how it looks it's all
gonna be blended of course in a minute
but I am just gonna kind of
that everywhere now that is a lot of
product I love a good concealer so let's
take this sponge and let's just press
this into our skin Wow okay
first impressions is high goodbye
discoloration now with this sponge you
can really get under the eye I may have
some sleep in my eye which yes I do you
guys this jetlag is real we're gonna go
back in with a sponge and go right up in
there perfect
blends out really quickly and really
easy so okay let me just pull back with
my mirror here and let's see how that
looks after blending out quickly oh wow
I'm like I mean we all know it's
concealer I'm not like so shocked where
I can't breathe but I'm like wow I mean
look at the before and after I'm just
gonna stare straight into the camera you
can definitely see a huge difference
here's the basic boring side and here is
the flawless side what do you guys think
so far so I don't know if there's a
magician living under my skin but I
really like how this is looking now
normally I'm used to like full
foundation then concealer but I see why
a lot of you who don't have enough time
to do a full face every day just throw
one concealer powder and mascara because
this was so easy I feel like I could put
this on in the morning and just feel a
little bit bad about myself no I'm just
kidding you guys should really embrace
your imperfections and really not give a
fuck makeup of course it's all for fun
but if you have dark circles and you're
insecure about them bitch what does make
up for right we see how this looks with
a sponge I think it looks great I would
love to do the other side and try my
finger it literally says on here you can
warm it up with your fingers and press
it in and then use a brush we're just
gonna go in and let's see what happens
so let's do the exact same amount as the
other side
now the only thing there's no blurring
primer so your pores down here may show
a little bit more but coupl so I'm just
gonna take my finger right here and
let's just start pressing it in and
dabbing it now of course a sponge is
going to soak up products so I may have
put on way too much which that's totally
fine we can always buff it in with the
sponge in a minute
okay so because I've put a lot of
product on I'm actually gonna take
someone and do it on my lid I didn't do
that on this side yet but you guys know
I always take my concealer and I do my
eyelid I do really the brow bone and
really everywhere so if you do have
extra product just take it and spread it
around now I know I have not blended it
up to my eye I don't want to irritate my
eye with my finger so I'm gonna take the
sponge and just buff it out a little bit
but as you can see it's definitely a
little bit more full with just the
finger which I really don't mind let's
blend and let's see how this looks I
literally forgot how good the sponge is
with this like edge here it gets right
up in that lash line are you guys so
let's compare both sides and let's see
which one we like more of course this
has just this sponge and this was my
finger and sponge so what are we feeling
am i blocking the light you guys sorry
anything so a lot of a lot of hotel
windows behind me okay so the formula is
hydrating thank god this has been drying
out for about 10 minutes and it's not
really settling it doesn't look crazy
you can see a little bit in my fine
lines under my eyes but we also haven't
said it yet so that is probably going to
hopefully help but it did settle a tiny
bit in my lines of course I've been
moving all around and I did not set it
so it's really not fair to judge it yet
but if you're someone that doesn't like
to set or your skin's maybe too dry and
hate setting powders you do want to be
mindful of that but so far so good honey
okay so let's take concealer and let's
put it everywhere else where I normally
would just for fun and we may even put
foundation over it but I just want you
guys to see how this looks I do look
brightening my chin sometimes I will
quit concealer under my contour just to
really shape my face hello
plastic-surgery how are you or as you
guys know I love
a little bit down my nose and of course
we're gonna brighten our foreheads so
let's take that sponge and let's get to
blend in oh wow I just blend so easy and
like huh hello nose I got a sunburn on
my nose what the fuck happened you guys
just press blend and wow I feel like I
could put on sunglasses and leave the
house and I'm ready to roll but first
impressions overall I am pleasantly
surprised with how this is looking
it's very it's funny because they did
say medium to full and also natural when
I was like rolling my eyes I girl girl
come on now but for some reason it
really is it's medium to full and it
just look natural how I'm like hmm
usually it's like taking already or it's
a little weird but no it's pretty good
so far
alright now that the concealer is laid
down let's set it now I know you're
gonna be alright let's see there laura
mercier setting powder I'm not gonna use
that today number one I forgot it number
two I've been loving the lemare one for
months now number three a lot of you may
not have the laura mercier and even if
you have a concealer by brand you do not
need to go buy the matching setting
powder or foundation or brush or
whatever people try to tell you if you
love a five dollar setting powder I
don't care if it's five dollars or 100
if it works for you use it over your
concealers because only you know what
really works for yourself so I am going
to go in with my favorite lemare the
powder we're just gonna take this sponge
dunk it right in and oh there it goes
let's just take that and press it right
under the skin now I love this because
it really just melts into that concealer
now remember I didn't do any concealer
on this lid only on this side but anyway
this powder for some reason it doesn't
really bake like it's not gonna sit on
top of it it literally melts like into
the formula and bam there it is
right Wow I'm like oh you guys see what
I'm seeing like okay let's set the left
side of the face and of course we are
gonna do the eyelid on this side and we
will match it in a second over there and
then I'm not gonna bake on the sides of
my face because I am gonna add some more
foundation around the concealer in a
second but Wow what do you guys think
and now I am gonna finish up my face I'm
really not gonna do crazy makeup it's
gonna be very minimal I'm gonna do some
foundation we're gonna do some bronzer
and some highlight and then I am gonna
get dressed I wish I could walk around
with the rope well maybe I can so I'm
gonna do this all around the concealer
this is like my foundation beard and
this is the mayor soft fluid you guys I
know this foundation is pricy and a lot
of you were rolling your eyes I mean
like you bougie yeah oh but this formula
is so good excuse me hair my ear needs
all right the foundation is laid I do
want to take some pressed foundation
powder from Chanel this is one of my
favorites and we are just going to place
it everywhere where the concealer is not
just just set the rest of my face to
make sure we don't look too crazy now I
gotta say this foundation and concealer
combo pretty happy with it
alright you guys I am gonna go finish up
the rest of my face and get dressed and
I will be right back
alright you guys my face is done I did
the most simplest look I took cake mix
ouch and sugar cane from the blood sugar
palette and just dabbed it on real
quickly and then I did candy floss
actually from the blood sugar palette as
a highlighter with sarcophagus from a 24
karat skin frost Pro palette on top and
I'm just like oh girl and then I finish
it with a little Burberry mascara and a
ciate London liquid lip and shade
undressed alright you guys I am going to
throw on a jacket it is 40 degrees
outside and we're gonna go shop for
makeup and let's see how this concealer
last so I did bought a mascara
under but I didn't do any shadow so all
day we can see how the concealer is
going to look so let's get going cheers
to
a straw for everything okay so question
the lighting in this hotel is so dim and
awful right now which is great because I
want to know the real lighting so what
do you think of the concealer for real a
little bit of creasing barely not it
doesn't look dry or no like go if Akala
gator-skin it feels nice still let's do
a little closeup you guys can really see
what it looks like I'm gonna look in the
reflection of my phone oh the Lighting's
horrifying which is great because
everyone at home can really see what it
looks like I like it I think it still
looks really pretty of course there is a
little wear and tear under the eyes it
said that there was anti creasing in
here we'll see in a few more hours what
happens but what do you guys think you
guys so I've had the concealer on for
about six hours now it is 543 p.m. here
in Vilonia and we're just showing one
about me all
all right so I brought a mirror out here
let's see what's going on here who the
mascara Burberry what's good honey look
at this it's like residue coming off on
Zieler from the mascara halo now I'm not
going to touch it up because we are not
touching up today we're going to show
you guys until the end of the day how
well the concealer holds up so there may
be some mascara marks on there but
overall concealer is looking dayum bitch
it's looking pretty good a tiny bit of
creasing but I've been looking down and
all over the place all day so for no
touch-ups pretty good right we are
checking in right now it is about 8:40 4
p.m. here in Italy and girl we stopped
our dinner so I can do a little quick
check-in we're having a jeffree star
cosmetics and holy dinner right now but
I'm my girl we gotta see this concealer
so let's really zoom in here I have no
idea what I look like so I have a
compact here let me give you my phone
now let me look okay honestly I haven't
looked at myself I'm a little shiny from
a lot of highlight and my foundation
being on without touching up but it's
really not bad like it's kind of sick
huh of course you guys can see the
mascara
the stained it's day on my eye which
thanks Burberry but um besides that the
concealer actually looks a made thing
not that I mention Shaw but Wow for
being on this long no touch-ups
I'm sure okay so we're doing our final
check-in it is 11:04 p.m. I'm tired the
jetlag is sinking in but let's do our
final check in right now I haven't
really looked in the last two hours
look I'm like whoa okay I've had this on
for hours and hours I know every check
and I mentioned the mascara besides that
I'm like are you guys see what I'm
seeing
besides a little barely creasing which I
would normally touch up throughout the
day myself without any touch-ups
this concealer is amazing so I think you
guys already know what I'm about to say
but not shocked here the Laura Mercier
full coverage ultra longwear concealer
is Jeffrey star approved I am shocked to
help write this formula has lasted no
touch-ups with really no primer except
moisturizer under it remember we did no
primer today it has upheld beautifully
so I think every day on this trip I will
be using this concealer I'm a little
shook right now wow I can't stop looking
at it I'm like doom Laura you did
Batgirl
you guys it's time for bed I am
exhausted I'm gonna go FaceTime Nate and
take all of this off so thank you guys
