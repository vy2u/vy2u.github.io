channel today I have pimpled for the
first time in five years and I'm
depressed so in today's video we are
going to be testing out a brand new full
motherfucking coverage foundation from
Laura Mercier you may have heard her
brand it's been around for a long time
but every beauty guru on YouTube uses
her setting powder it's translucent it's
amazing it's flawless I used to use this
all the time on my channel and then I
you know I started to use other stuff
and now you all know the mirror is my
tried and true but this one is a classic
everyone uses it it's amazing that Laura
Mercier has been around for a long time
and their products are amazing I love it
I also use their cream contour kit I've
used this several times on my channel
also you guys quickly I did not borrow
blac Chyna's robe that Rob bought her
this is my own from my own money but you
know what do I look like I'm in the bed
with her right now hold on hello guys so
moving on today we are going to be
reviewing yeah I got so many shades for
you guys cuz you know I can't match
myself online so this is the new
flawless fusion ultra wear foundation
now this is supposed to be long wearing
it's supposed to last for 15 hours I'm
like holy shit and it is basically a
medium to full coverage on the box you
guys it says that this is Laura the
longest wearing foundation which
seamlessly fuses to your skin with a
weightless layer that looks fits and
feels like a second skin well here's the
real team so I've been wearing a
different foundation than what I
normally use for the last week right so
every time I'm get ready I've been using
a certain foundation and I have this
crazy irritated pore on my nose which we
are not going to zoom in on because this
is like earth-shattering for me a
besides that I got this little temple
right here which is like what is going
on girl what the fuck so I think that
the foundation because I've been using
it for a week my skin is like what the
hell is going on like I review stuff
obviously a lot but I don't consistently
wear the same foundation that I review
for a week straight unless I'm in
love with it so my skin kind of having a
moment so yes I am a real person in the
motivating to this foundation it says a
lot it says that it is a 15 hour long
wearing oil-free transfer-resistant
liquid foundation it is basically for
every skin type it's a sensitive normal
dry combination oily it's literally
supposed to be for everyone also on the
website you guys it says that it's free
of fragrance it's derma logically tested
it is sweat humidity and water resistant
that's a lot of claims you guys I'm like
oh my god I want to mail this to someone
in Florida and let me know how it dirty
minutes outside this summer as usual I
got three shades I always like to at
least get three to see which one would
match and I did a little swatching
off-camera and I think I'm going to go
in with this one is vanilla so we got
vanilla up in here and I also got a
shade darker which is called a roux EC
ru if I'm watching that someone slapped
me so I'm going to use mainly the
vanilla one and mix a little bit of this
for the outer perimeters of my face now
of course I know this is the first time
most of you is coming with a pimple
let's see it the foundation covers it
when this foundation is $48 actually no
Laura Mercier is a luxury brand and I
love that this brand is putting out 20
shades to start I love that a lot of
brands recently I've been putting on
stuff and on my girl six shades or ten
shades growing leesneed 15 to 18 if
you're going to do a concealer or
foundation that's just my opinion you
will it need to have more but at least
start out with 15 so Laura put out 20
shades and I'm looking on the website
and yeah this is supposed to be like
amazing oh my god by the way it's a new
Beauty Blender you guys who's seeing
this on Sephora calm I die for this it's
like marble or Thai that I don't know
what they're calling it so besides that
you guys I'm going to test out the
foundation of course we're going to do
half my face Beauty Blender and the
other half a brush just to see how they
apply so I kind of want to take a page
out of my girl tattoos look she will do
like a wear test and I really don't do
that on my channel I like go away
throughout the day and I'll come back in
the studio and kind of show you how it
looks but it's still with all of the
Beauty lights so I do want to kind of do
what talk to you does for this video
specifically and kind of
take a gopro with me and Nate while we
go out through the day and I kind of
want to show how the foundation actually
looks in the daylight at nighttime and
then before I take off my makeup lighter
because this takes 15 hours and I'm like
whoo I'll probably up for another 10
hours so let's see how it looks all
right so of course we have to prime the
skin and like normal I'm going to go in
with my favorite primer from Sicily this
is the double Atencio primer this one of
my like go-to always it is so just
stunning and we're going to put it all
over her face so do we gotta shake this
I always take my foundations this does
not say that apply to clean skin with
Laura's foundation sponge bitch plays
I'm using a Beauty Blender or with
fingertips girl who applies our entire
foundation and blend it out with their
fingers oh I have no idea that's all I'm
a full-coverage coin that would be a lot
of finger movements oh and I do want to
know you guys that this product is
standard like most foundations it comes
with one fluid ounce now I'm going to
take this
let's do Beauty Blender on my right and
then we'll do the brush on my left okay
I do not know how full coverage this is
so let's just go slow at first and then
we'll see what happens let's bounce okay
so you really do got to move quickly
because the foundation that's already up
here is kind of drying all righty you
can see how it's like a little more
harder to blend out okay so that is the
first layer and on camera I can still
see my pimple
it is a crazy one but it's like is that
bad so looking close-up it does look
like it's kind of medium I think I want
to do like maybe another layer on top
just to see what it looks like and I was
going to use this darker shade but this
one matches me like pretty spot-on so
let's do another layer on the right side
all right you guys so this second layer
definitely a lot more full we're getting
there you can still kind of see that but
it's not that bad so of course we'll let
that dry but now let's take the brush
this is just a so for our pro dome the
stippling brush let's put some one here
now I'm just going to work this into
this part of my face since we now know
that it is kind of more it'll quick
drying formula and let's see how this
looks
oh wow I can already tell the brush is
making it apply more heavy which is
probably what I wanted the first round
but let's see alright Wow okay the brush
definitely applied it I feel like more
thick now let's remember this is a brand
new Beauty Blender just unwrapped so of
course it's going to soak up a little
bit of the product so maybe that's why
it wasn't as full as this but oh girl
this side is looking even better I feel
like all right now let's take a little
bit more just another little drop right
there and let's do the forehead area all
right you guys so what I've noticed of
course this is the brush side of the
face this is the Beauty Blender for some
reason I like the brush better which I
am kind of shocked to they never say
that but some products and maybe because
it is brand new but some products don't
work is the best with a damp sponge most
of the time they do I will say that if
we want to zoom in a little bit
I feel like this side looks a little
like my poor look a little bigger or
like they're showing more in this area
and then to me the brush side it's like
poor forms I'm gonna put on the rest of
my makeup I will put on my concealer and
powder on camera and then I will go
about my day and we're going to do some
talk to you check in girl alright now we
are going to buff in some concealer and
I am going to use the Beauty Blender
because that's what I love to do so
let's see how it reacts with the
foundation all right the concealer is
blended out and it looks pretty great
that looks really really nice over the
foundation which I was scared because
you couldn't no you never know even some
primers even some primers do not really
react well with certain foundations so
it's all about trial and error people
but I do think we should definitely go
in with the translucent Laura Mercier
setting powder it's only fitting
so let's dip in here and if you've been
watching me for a while you know I love
using a damp Beauty sponge to set the
eyes and the face wherever we put
concealer so let's put a hefty amount on
and let's get to setting okay so first
impressions just with this over the
concealer and now the full coverage
foundation
I'm loving this I am looking airbrushed
I'm looking 16 and I am just kind of
loving this look let me give you guys
some quick little first impressions so
right now as I'm like zoomed in on my
own self I am liking how this is looking
you never know how foundation is going
to react my skin is liking it definitely
covered a lot I mean all my
discoloration is gone
I look like one mask and so far so good
but how will it wear you'll have to
continue watching to see what the hell
happens hey guys so I just finished my
makeup now you guys know I am NOT a
vlogger
I don't normally ever vlog but I'm using
a GoPro just to you know follow me
around today and see how this foundation
wears now it's been about an hour I
would say and what do you guys think it
looks pretty matte like really really
nice I noticed it's like a little Creasy
right here in this area which always
happens to me and maybe a little around
the nose but I don't know how it's
looking on camera but I'm pretty
impressed with it so I am about to film
actually a lip swatch a video and then
head out
to an event so I will check in later
alright guys so it is currently 8:05
p.m.
I've had this foundation on for about
almost eight hours I don't haven't
really looked in a mirror in the last
few hours but nate is here
hey baby hey baby so how does my skin
look it look like shit it look great how
does it look I mean I still looks great
to be honest does it yeah I mean it
looks pretty full coverage to me so it
is increasing maybe a little here no oh
maybe a little bit maybe around the list
my line and yeah a little huh yeah just
a little bit okay I mean it's been eight
hours with going strong and yeah I look
good I don't feel Whaley you guys I
don't feel weird my skin tools nice it
doesn't feel heavy either like I don't
feel like I have a bunch of makeup on
right I will give it another few hours
before I take it off and let's see how
long it can last May I swear to God
alright you guys I am so tired
it is almost 11 p.m. and I'm a little
shook we'll take a little close-up right
here like look home mat that looks right
there it looks flat
okay laura mercier I'm a little shook at
you maybe barely a little crazy bear a
little here but like gonna go see Nathan
in the mayor he's helping me get some
lighting up in here you already know um
you guys I gotta say I am really
impressed with this blows fusion
foundation I think we had a hit on our
hands if you are someone that loves a
full-coverage mask I would definitely
check this out I think it was worth the
price point I'm looking the mayor my
forehead is so smooth after like almost
11 hours that's pretty good for me
