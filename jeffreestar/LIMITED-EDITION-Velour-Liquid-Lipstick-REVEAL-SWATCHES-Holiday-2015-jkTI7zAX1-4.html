I brought a little friend back with me
hi I'm Jake hyssop and we're here to do
another the lower liquid lip swatch
video I'm so excited
today we're going to be showing you guys
all five of the new holiday liquid lips
these are all limited edition now unlike
the blue ones the box is white and gold
and pink inside the cap is also white
with rose gold logo and stars around it
so these are very limited there is five
shades and they will be launching
November 6 on my website and they'll be
a more please website I'm really excited
for the museum I've never changed my
entire packaging yet so this is it first
for me and next month is my one-year
anniversary the years gone by thank you
really quickly lots happened I can't
believe I already have 18 shades out
another 5 coming yeah so this is crazy
should we get started I think we should
get started the first color we're going
to swatch for you guys is this really
nice soft pink
it's called adult hearts and I've done
some really neat on Pink's before some
dark pink so I want to switch it up a
bit
tone it down yes I do tone it down
sometimes and this one is really cool it
goes well with most every skin tone I've
tried on a bunch of people it's unique
it's very pretty very everyday everyday
executive girl um let's try it on now a
good tip you guys with any liquid lip is
to shake it for five seconds now the
product always will naturally separate
and I'm going to actually do a video
about liquid lip mix and the facts for
everybody so that will be later but for
now shake this for a little 5 to 10
seconds
and then while you're ready to apply
you
so now we try it on how do you feel I
feel like a party with like my purple
eyes in this background is what we're
very Malibu Barbie today right we're in
the peak format going down PCH at this
moment in my head the next shade we're
gonna show you guys is a true Christmas
green this is called mistletoe and it is
straight-up green now dirty my name is
very muted little more gray based this
one is just
hi I'm green how are you oh it's
different I love it I've never done a
bright green before I got a lot of
requests and a lot of emails from
customers saying make a brighter green
so voila your she is the cool thing
about my applicator is that it actually
bends and adheres to the lid whereas a
lot of other brands are smaller they're
hard a little bit more hard to use you
actually don't need a lip brush with
these products you can just put them
right onto the lip if you're careful of
course if we're doing live art 20 lip
brushes is great MA Merry Christmas
Holly so a lot of people may not know
but just does not work foundation I
don't I wear enough for both of us and
put the sake of my lips not falling off
by swatching so much you may see a
little bit of staining on my mouth I
don't want to rub off all my foundation
a mask under here okay the next shade
we're gonna be swatching is androgyny
this is such a pretty dark mauve tones
I'm obsessed with everything for holiday
it's like going to holiday parties it's
cool
now a lot of times they look a little
lighter in the bottle and dry down a
little darker as most liquid lips so
let's show them and Raja I'm so excited
for this color I'm worthless a few
months ago in an Instagram picture and
the internet blew up and they're like
you
Koller now so it's finally coming at me
guys it's so good it looks so good on
you love it this is like everyone's
coloring it's going to be a really good
go-to I feel like anyone can pull this
off but they're like light hair and that
color it's like venom the next color
we're going to show you guys is a really
cool red called ho ho ho yes
h OE h OE h OE now this is darker than
red rum and lighter than uniform blood
so this sits in the middle it's very
unique and it's hard to see on camera
but this has really tiny reflux of red
and like purple glitter inside which
looks amazing when a flash hits the lips
or sunlight it does a little blingy
legally no I only got a few samples from
my lab since this color just got done so
jess has a pink one but that's not what
will look like it will be in the white
both packaging like the other four
oh hello I'm good morning I think though
about the shame I love you I love the
sparkle and it's kind of like a
cranberry color if you like perfect for
perfect for a holiday season
what was that trick you're telling me
the other day about glitter like liquid
lips of glitter that if you rub with
your finger after it dries it kind of
activates and brings out the glitter
okay the final of our five holiday
shades is a pure white one it is called
druglord
the hardest lipstick name in the damn
beauty industry this is actually the
first white liquid to matte lipstick
that has ever been created I felt like
the makeup game was lacking something
you know everyone has black lipsticks
now even though I created my black I
feel like it stays on the best of every
brand
no offense host um so it was time to do
a white one now a lot of you are
probably like Jeffrey I wear no damn
white lipstick you can wear it by itself
of course it actually looks dope if you
want it have the confidence to pull it
off anyone can wear whatever shade they
want cool thing about this one is it has
so many uses yeah she loves I love to
mix them and my favorite mixture is with
weirdo it creates this really amazing
like stone gray color which is what I'm
going to be doing now if you've never
mixed liquid lips they're very easy to
mix right don't be afraid to mix them
you can mix the shade with anything you
can tone down uniform blood a more muted
rose color which I've done month which
looks bomb also you can use these as
eyeliner you can use them in the
waterline you can use them as liquid
liner for a cat eye they are vegan and I
save a lot of the white eyeliner is
cracked too and this one doesn't a lot
of them crack so this product is very
versatile yeah um jess is going to mix
drug lord with weirdo to show you the
combination and i'm going to wear by
itself so you can see how fake it is you
can mix in how much ever black you want
I'm gonna just do like the tiniest
and then I just mixed them on the back
of my hands until I get the desired kind
of pigment and color I want
okay the cool thing about the white is
you can make any liquid lip customizable
and a lot of people didn't know that you
can mix them so please try to have fun
play around makeup has no limits left
darker silver with your hair is like
giving me so much life right now I want
to see druglord just by itself though I
think is gonna look so sick on you okay
I'm gonna swatch it by itself so you
guys can see how opaque it is now my lab
and I had to import some extra pearlized
pigments because it was just too streaky
and I wanted more pigment more pigment
so they spent a lot of time on this more
melon I'm excited and it paid off okay
now as its drying sometimes I'll take
the applicator which still has um some
wet product on it and I like to kind of
finesse it onto the lip and dab it in so
it really looks Oh pig and non streaky
so there is druglord by itself so there
is it mixed we're always serving
bam-bam-bam-bam okay guys so that was
all five of the new velour liquid
lipstick shades for holiday let us know
which one is your favorite in the
comments below and I want to know what
makes sure you plan on mixing it with
druglord father and she's actually going
to be doing a video on her own channel
where she's going to be mixing her
favorite allure shades and customizing
her own colors which is my favorite
thing to do and it might inspire me to
make some future colors from your
creation and let's do it
alright guys remember these come out
November 6 at 10 a.m. Pacific Standard
