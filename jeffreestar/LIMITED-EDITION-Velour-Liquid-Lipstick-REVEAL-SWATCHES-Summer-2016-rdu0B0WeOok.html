channel we're going to get into
something special today really special
now summer is basically here it started
it is a thousand degrees worldwide and
it's time to reveal the five summer
velour liquid lip shade now if you're a
new customer or new to my channel
usually my lipsticks come in these pink
components like Barbie but for summer
I'm like we got to change it up I
changed it up last year for Christmas
and everyone went crazy so I'm like okay
we're going to do it again
now these all come in limited edition a
yellow capped color with the matte pink
really cute right come on pretty now
let's go into a little bit of details
all five shades are limited edition so
once they are gone the summer they are
gone and also as always my whole line is
vegan and cruelty free now these will be
sold as a 5 pack bundle so you get all
shades for a limited price and they'll
all be sold individually so before we
get to swatching four out of the five
shades that smell like watermelon Jolly
Ranchers they are so yummy oh my god I
don't want to eat them all up seriously
I'm like this if makeup was edible I'm
gonna eat this damn thing there's one
shade that has no flavor because I felt
like it almost tweaked the formula a
little bit and it is a shade that I had
in the past and some of you are gonna be
really excited that it's back so if you
want to see a swatch all five colors and
reveal everything keep on watching the
first shade we're gonna reveal is BAM
nude beach this is like a macaroni and
cheese nude it's so pretty
he's so everyday this is a really unique
nude I have a lot of nude shades we have
I'm new to celebrity skin posh spice
Gemini Rose madder dominatrix we have a
lot of colors but this one is really
unique and as a different tone it looks
really cool on my skin and hers we were
trying these earlier just for fun and
mixing and matching and this one is so
pretty so let's watch it oh this
watermelon though y'all don't sleep on
it because
eat Jolly Ranchers amazing
I almost like it on you better than me
no I think you then mean undress though
with that color is so doe
so obviously this color looks very
different on both of our skin tones but
I think it's very wearable very summer
very soon it's cool I love it I love it
mmm am i ha ha ha the second shade we're
gonna reveal is BAM
this bright reddish pink is called
watermelon soda so fine this one is so
pretty
it is very it's like the definition of a
hot summer day it's very bright in your
face very loud
kind of like my existence how in flannel
life so let's give this a little shake
and let's try it on
ah
this may be my new favorite of all time
oh I'm sorry Dahlberg
have a seat doll barn soda is really on
your ass for sure this is such a both of
us I'm looking the monitor like oh damn
oh damn so pretty now this is very
bright very bold and you know it's very
like hmm I think this is a universal
shade anyone can pull this off and I'm
like damn I want to do this with like no
imagine like no eye makeup just a little
mascara and this girl girl showstopper
love it all right come through red
carpet
come on now all right the third shade
reveal is BAM seven one four she's bad
bad
now this is one of my most requested
shades to come back this came out in
2015 in the summer I came out with queen
supreme it was such a hit now this is
the only shade out of the five that has
no watermelon flavor
now this shade is very hard to perfect
in my formula like really really light
shades like that drug lord and I'm nude
and this one they are just really hard
to get fully opaque and pretty so
disclaimer this one it is a little
streaky you just have to finesse it into
your lips which I know why most brands
don't talk about this stuff and that
every color can be identical there is a
base formula when you make cosmetics and
then once you start adding all the
pigments that's rig a little tricky so
we're gonna give this shade a swatch you
can see how amazing it is if you are a
new customer and you've never tried this
one they're gonna it's this time it's
time you're gonna you're gonna fall in
love so for all of the old-school
customers we're like old school my
brands Minh first of all my brands only
been out for a year in six months I
think a lot of people forget that I am
all about the customer you guys are the
ones that make this brand so successful
so when I got a million emails to bring
this back I'm like she's coming back
girl let's bring your bag come
on now
oh I love this straight on me I'm like
why did I ever make it go away again
anyone Tony all right it is drying down
and voila
Bayonne I really love the shade on every
single person like at mmm this is the
one so if you missed seven or four from
last year now is your chance to finally
get it again give it a whirl and people
love using these for liquid liners so if
you are new high if you're old school
you're like bitch I already know the
drill all of my liquid lips are ice safe
so I know like a few weeks ago many MUA
use this shade for like graphic liner
and it was so gorgeous gorgeous I was
like okay bitch I'm gonna try that I see
you I see you yeah so these are very
versatile and this shade it's perfect
for this year yes I'm like hi now if you
guys want this to be in the permanent
line we'll have talking about that later
but let me know in the comments below
and maybe we're gonna have to make that
happen for you guys alright let's get to
the next shade let's do it
the fourth shade is BAM virginity now I
did you this a month ago in one of my
videos called the definition of deceased
makeup tutorial and everyone's eyes roll
so what is that we know this is the
lighter more nude sister of below pony
and I'm royalty so these are all in the
purple family BAM
and virginity is a really pale lavender
it's like a lavender nude and it is
really gorgeous Emma this is like I
don't know if it's mine I don't know if
it's my favorite but it's just so
wearable like I just want to wear this
every single day so let's give her a
swatch
oh come on already I can't breathe
oh girl this shade is very pale almost
to kill for me so anyone you know you
know any anyone darker than than my skin
complexion in may not work for you
unless you mix it with a darker color
but it is so pretty it's so summer
I could barely wear it but obviously you
guys can see I'm it looks it looks dope
on you but right it is very pale because
it has a more of like a light white base
to the purple so if you're afraid of
this one tribe low pony or I'm royalty
or the cool thing is you can mix these
with any other brand and liquid lip yeah
and play around
alright now let's reveal the fifth and
final shade are you guys ready I don't
think they're ready
hiving xiety get rid of sit down sit
down right now because mmm
girl okay coming for you now the fifth
and final shade is something that I've
been working on for a while a lot of
people online know this was coming they
knew it was coming they knew I was
making it BAM
a hot yellow liquid lip which has by my
understanding never really been done
before I was tell me I mean like for a
liquid to matte I know a lot of people
try to read me because I said I was the
first one to do a white liquid lip now
before me there were other brands that
had done a white lipstick obviously but
mine was the first liquid to matte so
I'm like I got it I got up this one so I
created this crazy gorgeous yellow which
obviously this is not an everyday color
but for ombre for lip art and for
eyeliner this is amazing so we're gonna
of course swatch on our lips and then
I'm gonna do a little little cute wing
on one of her eyes maybe both and we'll
show you how versatile this guy is now
