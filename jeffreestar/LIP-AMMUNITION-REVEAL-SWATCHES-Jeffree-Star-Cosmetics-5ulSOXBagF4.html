channel today I am sharing some really
really exciting news jeffree star
cosmetics finally has a brand new
product launching September 30th now I'm
sure you can see by the title this is
the shade reveal of my new product
called lip ammunition so today in this
video we're gonna dive in and go through
all 10 shades I'm gonna swatch them on
my mouth and we're gonna talk about the
product which let's just jump into it
right now now this product has been in
the works for a few years I'm gonna give
you guys a little backstory and then
we're gonna swatch all these guys first
of all community a minute to look at
this chrome beautiful bullet you guys oh
my god okay so I'm gonna do a quick
little backstory in 2013 when I quit
music and I was going through my
transition of what the fuck I was gonna
do with my life I started to develop a
stick
lipstick with my lab and I've had the
name lip ammunition in my head for years
and I've always looked at every brand on
earth and I'm like okay something's
missing and I think that the jeffree
star lipstick needs to be created it
needs to happen but what is she gonna
look like so I created this idea even
before the liquid lip so we started
creating all the shades but I was also
developing my liquid lipstick so this
one was actually done before this in the
lab so we went ahead and made this
product the infamous velour liquid
lipstick and it became such a hit so
quick and went viral I was just like
okay this guy is gonna take a back seat
and this one is going to come out first
and then I spent all of 2015 just making
a lot of SKUs we did over 35 shades of
this including holiday and all the
limited stuff so first of all I just
want to say thank you to all the
subscribers and customers for making
this such a hit I have a lot more shades
coming so this product will be permanent
in my line forever and they'll be a
million shade extensions now back to the
sky since the liquid lip became such a
hit I'm like okay we're gonna take a
little break from lip products so I put
out my highlighter we put out the beauty
killer eyeshadow palette and I'm like
it's time to get back to lips I feel
like since I've come out with mine
I feel like every brand on earth has a
liquid lipstick now which is amazing now
I feel like it's time to rewind and go
back to loving just regular lipsticks
I've always loved lipsticks I grew up
wearing a pink lipstick from high school
on to now so I wanted to make my own
version now the lip ammunition has two
formulas currently so when they launched
on September 30th there will be ten
shades huh let me try that again
ten shades there will be nine
satin-finish lipsticks and one glitter
now as the year rolls by and next year
there will be a lot more shades and even
more finishes but I just kind of want to
introduce a few formula so you guys can
see what I've been working with and I'm
just going to give you guys a little
just a little information about this
this has 0.12 ounces of product in here
and it just it kind of looks like
something like this it comes off and the
lipstick room barium is right there and
of course the shade labels are on the
bottom and it comes in a box like this
with that silver foil on the front of
course the box has the ingredients a
little beauty tip and all the
information that you need for this
little guy now this is just like my
entire line vegan and cruelty free these
will also be retailing for $18 just like
my liquid lipsticks and when they go on
sale I'm just going to pray to Jesus
that we made enough because girl I've
been ordering mass quantities of
everything so the lip ammunition will be
sold exclusively on my website and on
beauty leash comm so all my other
retailers will get them later in the
year and I just can't wait for you guys
to see these to smell these to touch
these I you guys know I'm a sugar
fanatic so all my products are very
sweet and delicious so um I think it's
time to dive into all ten swatches where
we get to swatching I'm just going to
talk about the colors there are several
pinks and I want to say several I mean
six out of ten have a pink vibe from
light pink nude to hot Jeffery star
signature pink and then there are
you know a little nude a little purple
and a little burgundy moment now the
cool thing about this is a few of your
favorite shades and the velour liquid
lipsticks made it into the lip
ammunition but most of them are brand
new shades so let's dive in alright the
first shade I'm gonna swatch is called X
supermodel this is a gorgeous nude pink
oh my god
listen not just because it's my own
color I'm just like bitch this this is
like one of my easy go-to everyday
colors I think I might wear this to my
funeral we'll see but umm let's get to
swatching come on one swipe coverage now
these are packed full of pigment you'll
need one swipe and of course if you're a
an extreme pigment lover you might want
to do it a few times just for fun but
you really only need one swipe of
average
ah they feel so good on the lips okay so
this is ex supermodel I am obsessed with
the shade I'm like almost kind of Mendes
my hair but I'm also wanting to make a
quick note that I know a lot of
lipsticks sometimes they're round I mean
standard is they laser cut straight
lipstick now I love this because the
point just really defines the lines and
gets in there some brands have like a
round tip I'm adding to the round tip
well mmm
sometimes but y'all know what I mean um
okay let's go to the next shade all
right the next shade is celebrity skin
now this shade was such a hit in my line
I had to bring her back for a different
formula this is just such an easy warm
toned dark nude color that anyone can
pull off and it looks identical to the
liquid lip color so if you're a fan of
that you are going to love this guy
all right I think this is one of my
favorites I know we haven't even
swatched the rest but gosh darn it I
love this color
the third shade is a brand-new one and
this one is called a baby spice boom of
course inspired by my obsession with the
Spice Girls since sixth grade
now this shade is a cool toned medium
pink not really like hot hot pink but
kind of in the middle for those of you
that are scared for the neon but bored
of the really nude so this is a
in-between color and uh you know I love
my pinks
alright this is a baby spice a very cool
bubblegum sexy I think this one is going
to work for every skin tone
alright the next shade is the only
glitter formula in the line
currently there will be several more
glitter formulas later but this is the
one and only this shade is called beauty
pageant and it's inspired about my love
for the glitz and the glamour now I'm
not sure how this looks on camera it is
really sparkly now this one is a little
more sheer than that satin formula so
it's not like fully opaque blinding like
you press the loose glitter on your lips
this gives it a little more of like a
shiny glitter effect it looks gorgeous
when there was any light around you and
in the sunlight girl now this does have
a little bit of color to it but it is
really packed with shimmer so let's put
it on mmm yes
hmm now the cool thing about the glitter
formula is that you can add these over a
current lipstick that you're already
wearing liquid lips are the best to put
it over because already kind of like a
matte canvas
popping this in the center are all over
Oh gives you the best feeling and then
just for fun I'm gonna turn on my iPhone
flashlight just so you guys can kind of
get the full effect oh yes come on shine
I just I love this is very sheer so if
you're someone that is a little scared
of color this is perfect for you and
I've also created a few more colors that
will come out later in the year or next
year uh y'all know I'm that plan all
right the next shade is one of my
favorites this is a straight-up Barbie
hot pink and this one is called
Jeffrey's girl this was definitely
inspired by that Rick Springfield a song
Jessie's girl from the 80s and 90s oh my
god please don't kill me my mom I loved
this song and she's just sing that
lyrics like I wish that I was Jeffrey's
a girl so I was like okay girl but this
color though girl
this shade is a very neon very bright I
think if you're bold enough to pull it
off ah it's a Jeffrey staple the next
one is a bright lavender called popsicle
dream and she looks something like this
barium I love this one it is a very like
it's way brighter than lilac but it's in
the middle like it's not too purple but
it's just just right
all right this is a popsicle dream on
the mouth oh I am feeling the fantasy
with this one hi the next shade is a
neon pastel kind of like queen supreme
but a little lighter and she is called
ice cream Boulevard barium this one is
very light but also packs a punch so
it's in between that neon pastel realm
but also very pretty gosh darn it
this is icecream Boulevard now you guys
know I am very transparent so with this
shade it is very light in color and in
pigments so if you are someone that has
a really dry lips I would definitely
exfoliate before hand because any little
like pieces of skin or little ridges
will definitely show more with any light
colored lipstick or nudes so you
definitely want to exfoliate before you
use this one but this one this color
though I'm like this is like very
pornstar very girl-next-door the next
shade is a dark blue purple this one is
kind of like Barney's whole existence
this shade is called Grand Daddy part
yes God now of course this was inspired
by my love for cannabis and one of my
favorite strengths ever now this shade
is not for the faint of heart it is it's
almost like my liquid lip I'm royalty
but way more bluer it's almost like if
I'm royalty and blue velvet had a baby
and this is the outcome so let's swatch
her down
all right this is a brand that a perp
now she is a very vibrant now I want to
say one thing this color you do have to
work it into the skin for this little
one more second to get it really
beautiful and fully opaque if you are
scared I'd suggest using a lip liner but
she is creamy and just so you know all
these are very hydrating the ingredients
are very moisturizing so your lips don't
ever feel like you know chalky and dead
um these are as you can see it has like
a tiny little bit of a sheen to that
side and they mmm feel delicious now
these are not kiss proof so these will
come off if you are making out giving
kisses or doing other activities which
you all know I love to do but I'm just
gonna show you how these come off let's
do a little do kiss on the cheek yeah
mmm mmm come on kiss mark definitely it
comes off so you will need to reapply if
you had dirty bitch we have only two
shades left out of the ten now this next
one the ninth shade is one of my not one
of my the number one most bought liquid
lipstick from my collection she had to
make an appearance in the live
ammunition this is unicorn blood I put
two straight out last year in the velour
liquid lip formula and it exploded
everywhere so thank you for making that
color such a smash I had to bring her
bad girl so you guys already know what
this looks like but I'm gonna swatch it
for you anyway
unicorn blood y'all know it's that dark
rusty red that I am obsessed with now
this looks really good with my eye
makeup I'm like shed you tutorial on
this look you guys will have to let me
know let's watch the last shade as we
are down to the last swatch my mouth is
like bitch please spare me in between
takes I have been rubbing a little bit
of foundation on my mouth and I've also
been using my velour lip scrub after
every like three or four because Mama's
lips are kids or all right guys last one

coral her name is a starfish whoa this
