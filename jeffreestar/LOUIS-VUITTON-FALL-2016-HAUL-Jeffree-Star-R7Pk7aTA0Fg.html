channel now today listen today's just
not any old day today is a Louis Vuitton
fall 2016
haul now after my Gucci one went a
little cray-cray everyone is like can
you please do some more so I am back now
over the last few weeks and Nathan and I
have just we've murdered the Louie store
let's keep it really real radio and
Topanga honey we cleaned you out and I
am so sorry but the creative director of
Louie is literally just killing my
existence and I cannot believe how much
good shit is out so in today's video I'm
gonna be diving into some handbags huh
some handbags some backpacks some shoes
the new luggage collection they have put
out a lot of shit and I'm addicted so
before that I have to introduce you guys
to somebody special
this is daddy and a little daddy is my
fourth Pomeranian he is only two months
old so me and Nathan are going to train
and raise him from birth and we are so
excited he is so precious and Deva
diamond and delicious are all obsessed
with him and they have been playing just
like non-stop like he just woke up from
a nap I'm like hi honey you wanna come
see huh come say hi say honey everyone
dude I can't you guys he is so adorable
what I just had to introduce him to you
guys so I'm gonna go let him uh go back
to sleep without being said let's dive
into some fashion I know I've mentioned
backpacks a million times by now but I
can't stop buying backpacks now Louie
just put out three different designs so
I had to get all three now they look
something like this oh girl yes God it's
like basically covering my face so this
one is a cute little cheetah now I love
the size it is perfect for your wallet
your vibrator your highlighter a cup of
water and even your checkbook and
accessories it's perfect for just an
everyday travel bag I
wearing them when I travel especially
when I'm in the airport I don't want to
lug around a big old purse and a
carry-on these are everything now I love
this cheetah 1 it's definitely different
it doesn't really show that it's Lily
except this little emblem right here so
I kind of like it it's like a little
subtle and now of course we're gonna go
into the basic plain little brown one
which I love the classic monogram which
ten years ago I got tattooed on my
fingers right there below the nails and
then this one it looks like the last one
from behind but they um they switched
the colors and reverse them for the
front I pray that they make a bag or
backpack with this entire color because
who died all right now let's dive into
handbags my favorite subject on the
planet besides dick we did makeup
now listen Louie has been fucking
murdering the handbag game and look at
this one though I'm looking down like oh
girl so you all know my lord liquid
lipstick shade Scorpio it has just been
such a hit so I saw this bag and it
literally looked like in slightly
lighter version and this little bag
looks something like this
I mean are you kidding me I really need
to wear these two together like
immediately now this one of course I've
got the bag charm separate envy it's
like met toll this one is really cute
and quaint as what I like to call it
this leather color is really gorgeous I
love the nude tone almost looks like
posh spice liquid lipstick as well of
course you know I love all the gold
hardware now the color stole my heart
but there's more now this next one is
one of my favorite colors any time I see
a pink bag you guys honestly unless it's
hideous I have to have it now this one
is really soft baby pink the reason why
Louie has been killing me is this guy
look at this oh hi V biome and then it
looks a little something like that now
this V was on that necklace I wore in a
video last week which everyone was
asking what the hell where is that
necklace from it is a Louie one and
just love that now this is really cute
for just going out for an evening going
to a quick gangbang with your
sister-in-law and just living life
you already see the Navy on this one
because this color screams a fall and
I've never really seen Lois do a color
like this and the red piping know why I
died this is like executive cunt
realness it is a very businesswoman very
bitchy and I had to have this color it
looks like now these next ones are the
cute little Louie Alma's
girl you know I had to get this like
coral baby pink moment and then of
course the classic Brown monogram you
can never have too many of these I love
the shape of this bag this is actually
this is not in all my it's called
something different and I'm gonna botch
it so I don't fucking remember this is a
little Alma it is so cute they used to
make them in a jumbo size and they tame
them down now they come in this size and
then the BB um this glossy finish though
like oh I want a lip gloss in this exact
shade if anyone knows have one please
tell me below this one is really cool I
love the shape of this guy and the black
poking out is so I don't know it's just
getting me high fashion and I'm obsessed
like how big the shopping bag is like
I'm getting up again y'all oh girl look
at how big these bags are what and I
love what they change the color but um
Oh Lord Jesus alright since the winter
season is upon us and I hate being cold
I got a few scarfs when I saw the color
pink I was like ah hi pink now this one
is such soft material and come on the
dark monogram with the light just killed
me I died a little bit inside I was like
oh my god it matches me yes I just want
to wrap it up and bundle up next to a
fire and eat some s'mores now another
one is this really soft baby pink color
look at that what it is like really pale
almost on the peach side then you flip
it around and it's baby pink I'm like
what's up I'm trying I'm ready to go to
New York I'm ready to hit the fucking
ski slopes girl
I love scarves and I literally only wear
them when it is really cold because I
don't know you guys I just run cold
already and thank god Nathan runs hot
because hello cuddling oh right
so me and Nathan love shoes yeah I'm
definitely obsessed with some of the
styles that he has they're crazy right
yeah um so I love matching so when I
have the normal brown bags I like Nathan
to match me I think it's fun
recently Louis just has been flooding
the market with crazy shoes and I love
sneakers myself Nathan is a sneaker
junkie I'm the sneaker whore and we both
got cute little Matt kind of matching
kicks they look a little something like
this I love that they're both matte
black but he has the classic brown and I
have the new black and gray design that
they just put out oh my god and that's
genic it is right yeah we have matching
luggage for this stop it I'm obsessed
beside these little guys I found these
amazing they're like a Louis Vuitton Doc
Marten is what I'm going to call them
look at that cute zipper detail and they
are dope the cool thing about these ones
if you opened up it has the brown
monogram inside oh wow
which is so cool I love this sometimes
when I run to the store to grab some
like video game stuff I'll walk in there
and see if they have anything for my
baby I found a little makeup bag
I loved the black trim on this one it's
so easy for travel and I just love
putting makeup and stuff in this and I
always carry my makeup in my carry-on
because you know TSA be fuckin on my
shit and breaking all of my eyeshadow
palettes so I like to travel with my
makeup on person now last but not least
is luggage and do you ever have any good
luggage before we met I had zero luggage
I don't really give a fuck about luggage
either but now we started to get
matching luggage together and it's the
cutest thing I've ever done no no but on
a real note wait that was real
that was cute baby Louie came out with a
black-and-gray like graphite powder and
it looks something like this now these
are what we bring a lot of clothes with
they're so big we can even show them
also I want to say a fun fact that on my
first album I ever recorded called
beauty killer which is available on
iTunes right now there is a song called
Louis Vuitton body bag which features
Matt Skiba who is now one of the singers
up blink-182 so come on Louis Vuitton
throwback oh this color yeah
this is like the fuckin big ol bag
matches the toiletries and it matches
much of my fucking exhibits this is like
a smaller version of the black and grey
it's got a little different touch on the
bottom I have my book bag that I go oh
that's your little laptop case yeah
that's cute I just love this pattern
when we saw it in the bun no we were
like we'll take it all please yeah I'm
just it's more obsessed all right guys
this concludes my Louis Vuitton haul
thank you so much for watching this and
I just want to say one quick disclaimer
in case you didn't watch the Gucci video
if you're someone that loves to be
negative and talk shit about how someone
else spends their money girl log off and
go fucking work harder I think life is
all about enjoying the people you're
with and also having fun if I can dress
however the fuck I want might you I just
feel like we're on this planet for such
a short amount of time when other people
worry about what others are doing or
spending I think it's ridiculous do you
baby and don't let anyone tell you
otherwise so we love you guys so much
mwah bye guys see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
