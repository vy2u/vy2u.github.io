channel hi baby
a baby alright so I'm sure you guys have
seen our snapchats lately we've been
going on a crazy Louie Vuitton spree
just a tiny berry just a little one now
I've heard of supreme before of course
but woman what is that I mean it just it
was a really it was a big skateboarding
brand back in the day like and it's
still pretty icon oh ya know and it's
like it was more of your high-end
skateboarding brand organic top tier it
was like yeah I would say probably one
of the top tier for sure cool yeah so
when we got this alert on Instagram of a
new post we open up our phones and this
red and white monogram print was
screaming at my face and listen bitch if
you have been following me for a while
you know I have been collecting a Louis
Vuitton for about twelve years now I
have so many cool limited-edition pieces
thrown over the years we have a crazy
closet and vault in our house that
requires a fingerprint access and I have
a crazy collection so when I saw this
stuff I was like oh yeah I couldn't I
couldn't believe I was like possessing
so pretty ray my MIT I was like wait a
minute this is like escape pending
company yeah so if you guys don't know
this nathan is a skateboarder himself
he's been skating for how long like 12
years or so so it's a big part of his
life he loved doing it and to start the
show of this video is that Louis Vuitton
actually collab with supreme on a
skateboard
with a custom trunk and that's kind of
like the star of the show the sickest
thing ever
we dye it so in today's video we're
going to be showing you all the stuff
that we got from the collection now if
you don't know this the Louis Vuitton
and supreme collection is no longer
available for some reason they pulled
some of the pop-up stores or they might
have been like a weird mystery around it
and it really isn't in stores so there
was pop-up shops like around the world
it was like la New York Miami London
yeah and then there was supposed to be
like a huge in-store thing never showed
up didn't happen
no but everyone not ordered it like
myself and Nate we got all of our stuff
which is Hawking awesome so I slightly
more of a collector's item now because
it's more like more attitude more
exclusive it's hard to get very
armed right so if you are someone that
likes to see some cool you are
going to like this video if you do not
looking at luxury items and you think
that fashion such girls like Manny says
right so if people think is crazy new
Supreme Hall that's good keep on
watching we're going to start off this
whole by talking about course clothes
they put out some really sick
clothes I'm just like in love with this
list read Louie print
he wears hoodies a lot yeah I'm like a
hoodie phonetic and I'm a really big on
red so this was just like this is of
course is the leather jacket I love it
so it's really nicely made like I
appreciate good fashion this is really
sturdy it feels so warm and cozy I'm
like I just want to like maybe be buried
in it and because we're so extra
we got matching jackets and hoodies now
when I buy like this you guys I
love the little little details so these
buttons on the back of the jacket we're
going to try to zoom in here they
actually say Louis Vuitton on them it's
like everything is custom and I love the
detail yes very little detail and the
fabric or the inside of the jacket is
actually the little Louie print which I
have to tattoo to my fingers we're just
going to show that off of my fingers
what would and then my favorite start of
the jacket if I were to turn around is
the supreme on the back it's right above
your ass alright what's next
we'll check out the denim ok like they
didn't just do red print they had to go
into the denim looks like a baseball
like t-shirts have a jersey yeah this
Jersey is like that's so sick and just
the random supreme print all over it's
so sick it looks really cool and then
is the denim long jacket I'm not going
over makeup on my station yeah and this
has the print as well it looks so cool
I'm not really that into denim I've worn
it a few times but this is I
love denim so yeah like so we're a
little pissed because Nate loves
overalls and we could not give couldn't
they're so hard to get like sold out I
saw Travis Scott wearing on my girl call
me give me the mammal roll for name and
y'all know I had to get that camo this
camo Lewiston is like so subtle you can
almost barely see it
yeah let's zoom in on the detailing it's
like what you can see in the sunlight
better if you like get the my jacket and
the hat and it has the dope
like leather strap on the back - it's
not like your traditional plastic so
it's Louis like we need to lay no
plastic yeah we're going to go all out
I'm laughing so hard in between Jake's
you guys but the bane of my middle my
boards bending out okay you guys there's
so much a fashion here I'm going to
scream yeah there's quite a bit and I
have the hiccups
thank you watermelon juice let's just we
got to show these gloves off so these
are Louie supreme baseball glove they're
so cool got this just cream
right on the strap yep and of course
Nathan just for these at the a PMA
Awards it was pretty sick yeah he'll
wear them with a red suit here we're
going to insert the picture here and
that's it so nice gloves with everything
I'm like you actually dressed better
than me that night thanks to you and
then there's a damn bandana I love
scarves I mean I think it's supposed to
be a scarf but I think it looks cooler
that way can't really feel the globe
little try but it's a bandana I had to
get these shoes oh my god they're kind
of heavy they are they got like big
soles on they do these are like almost
democracy platforms but they're like
they definitely give you like an inch on
them when you wear them but they're
really comfy I wore them yesterday I
don't like wearing white stuff you guys
because I'm so scared of getting it
dirty or like even you like go in the
car you hit the brakes
it's cuffs the side and you're
just like
and then I guess it's supreme right on
the heel in there that's cool
and then it looks a little LV right here
I think that is so cute all the details
kill me okay I don't know this is my
favorite piece but it's a second
runner-up is the phone case you guys
already know I in the Louis Blanc a
score so when I saw this one I was like
oh I dyed it so these were super limited
they're happening to see anyone with it
yet no I haven't at all which is wild
yeah and then they had to go and make
sunglasses now I know for the few pairs
there was a black pair that I could not
get a hold of your bitch could not get
it but these are red ones I died for if
you look closely you can see the Louis
print on the glasses and it's like
almost going to curl it it feels like
really futuristic like obviously
everything is red when you look through
which is so bizarre not bad this looks
so weird
oh yeah but what I love how they look it
looks cool they're very like I don't
know going oh what's nice noon well we
got a few things for our bedroom we sure
did we did in the college do we we got
the libertine sex swing you know that
was installed last week I wish no they
they put out blankets and pillows which
I thought was so cool and they feel
really soft like look at this big old
pillow we got a few of these about one
of the lasers one opens up pretty big
and they stitch in this cool piece of
leather with the supreme logo on it that
looks so cool it's imagined to be like
luggage okay so now and we may be
getting lit in between takes and guess
what YouTube will not allow us to show
that anymore
okay this is probably some of our
favorite pieces as well is the crazy
luggage set this is the big ol supreme
keep all this is this young bull a
little body sling with bobby swings I'm
going on a higher that is the cross body
this is sick for like this traveling and
going to a show right I don't going to
and if you have like nice pants on they
don't really have pockets or something
yeah kind of a cool little fashion
statement here's Nate in favor piece the
backpack yeah you can't get any better
and then they got the inside like black
suede all on the inside really sick
how many times we're gonna stay safe I
don't know it's because it's pretty
 sick
okay now the star of the show is this
beautiful custom trunk
I think they literally made maybe like
ten of these ever right an entire
 world and all crazy Louie is so
 cool to me and they allowed us
to get our hands I wanted to order it
well let me tell the rules the real
story is I make so Nathan's birthday's
in a few weeks and when they hit me up
about this a while ago they were like
hey we know Nate loves skateboarding and
I was like oh my god this was such a
cool like early birthday gift
the price is ridiculous but um
look we work hard we go play hard no and
I think not sound like a douche
bag this is like the world's most
expensive skateboard because of course
you are banker the trunk right let's do
a little sneak peek but you guys we
actually are going to go to the skate
park later and we're going to film Nate
trying it out I don't know anything
about skateboards so he's going to
obviously tell us is it good are the
wheels good isn't shitty is it
like did Louis kill it or did they let's
not kill a lot thank you um so I have no
idea
we'll check it up what is good or what
isn't of course I don't ride skateboards
so he's actually gonna write it I'm
gonna ride him one time and then we're
gonna put it away right so so that would
be part two of this video of course that
will be coming later this week but I'd
like to open it for a second give him a
little sneak peek lifted a heavy
show you this real quick so Nate gotten
his initials and grades on to the
luggage it looks so cool open her up all
right should we open this bad bitch up
let's open her room it's like glowing
gold right so of course if you want to
see Nate ride the skateboard test it out
and go through all the secret
compartments that's under it that will
be in part two of this video this is a
crazy ho definitely one of the what will
is one for the book that I want as
someone that collects fashion this was
just such a cool operation and I
think the fact that I'm so into Louie
and my man is soda skating it was such a

perfect combination really on Cerrillos
really created I was like blown away
when when I want to showed you this what
did you die I was like we were both
sitting here thinking like if that fake
is that really are they really coming
out but you know I mean or you were
right
no that was I think it's present I
probably ever gun oh thanks baby

let's just this bitch out let's do this
