channel and if you're new hi guys what's
up I'm about to review the new l'oreal
infallible pro glow foundation now I got
a few of these colors off of amazon.com
I know they launched a week or two ago
and they sold out really quickly now
what caught me was the word glow and
then pro I'm like pro glow I saw the
word GL o W and I was like Jesus take
the will I have to try this now you guys
know I'm a stickler for high-end luxury
foundations I will never ever be able to
replace my door and my Georgia Armani
this is like my favorite for ever but I
saw this and I was like Angie I found
two shades I know they sold out so
quickly I couldn't even get I want to
buy like five shades because it is so
hard trying to buy foundations online hi
anyone else with me it's like okay
natural buff what the does that
even mean and then this one is classic
ivory which usually I'm pretty pale but
it's summertime I'm warming up my skin a
little bit we're doing a little bronze
moment obviously this is not natural at
all this is like an alien sex like
fuchsia hot pink I don't even know
cyborg basically this is not natural the
foundation is very glowy now this was
$12.99 which i think is a really good
price point now this says 24 hour
foundation am I gonna wear it foundation
for 24 hours
no one should do not keep makeup on your
face for 24 hours so L'Oreal I love you
but who what do you be even to be awake
for 24 hours is that healthy unless you
have insomnia I don't advise doing that
this says on their website that this is
a hydrating glow foundation lightweight
and creamy this is long-lasting goes on
smooth
and there's a glow finish that last
which of course most foundations say
that and they lie to you but does this
one does this one glow at the end you'll
have to find out and watch to see so if
you guys want to watch and see my real
opinion on this guy continue watching
all right so let's jump right in
so these foundations were actually
really hard to get a hold of I saw trend
mood on Instagram post that they were
available on Amazon so I quickly went on
there and there's only a few shades left
now I got two colors now this one I
think might be too light for me this is
the 2:01 classic ivory and then I found
the 2:04 natural buff which is like a
little shade darker than my natural skin
tone but so I think I'm going to go with
the darker one we are getting into
summer I do like to like a little bronze
and not so Vampira and come in and just
go in with this guy and see what happens
now the reason why I was so excited to
try these is because it says pro glow
and I'm like if there's a glow in this
foundation I'm gonna cry now I am going
to use a primer now just to be a shady
bitch I'm going to use a $75 primer from
grill Ain this is unreal if you guys can
tell this has real flakes of gold in it
come on and I've used this before me and
laganja use this and we fell in love so
i'm just gonna apply this with a little
gucci foundation brush oh look at the
gold I died I'm like huh okay so I'm
just going to paint this all over my
face now this is a such a bizarre
texture because when I think primer I do
not think this because if you have ever
swatched this at Neiman's or heard about
it it's just really weird almost has
like a liquid feel to it and then all of
a sudden it like sucks in your skin
and leaves you just like all right now
it's only fair that we take a little
more on the neck as well I always pride
my neck oh right
look at the little gold flake on me
that's so cute all right I am gonna let
this settle in for a second let my face
just have a moment let's get to the
foundation so I was debating whether or
not to use this new morphe foundation
brush this is the e for for and I'm like
mmm I used to always use foundation
brushes before the Beauty Blender was
such a hit now of course I'm addicted to
this so I'm gonna start by doing half of
my face with this show you guys that
comparison and then we'll finish it off
with this guy so this foundation on the
back says shake well dot onto skin in
rolling motions for flawless coverage
bitch I wanted to shake well and apply
it now I wanna so we're just gonna do a
little I don't know how much discovers
so I don't want to overdo it so you
should I just kind of dot around my face
and well when we try to just do half now
of course this is going to be a little
darker than my natural skin tone so
don't try to read me I am doing this on
purpose
just to put that out there the
foundation has kind of like a paint like
smell and I don't mean like an a
horrible strong bad way it's just
oh my glue smell the other one oh wow
the lighter one was smells stronger not
a bad horrible fragrance so now let's
buff this out right off the bat I see
the luminosity on the foundation which
is great because who doesn't want a
little extra glow I'm like hi full
coverage foundation and a glow sign me
up
oh my god I'm like feeling so summery
now looking this this pan I actually
like it though let's let the foundation
settle and completely dry so we're gonna
give that a second the texture is really
nice it's not like cakey it's not weird
and coagulate on my skin it's very
luminous but also like there's a lot of
my discoloration is like gone I mean
already compared I'm like hi
discoloration
oh hi manikin skin alright so the left
side of my face has the foundation fully
dry now I love it cuz it's dry but it
still has like this luminosities and
then here is my blank side so I think to
finish off the rest of the face I'm
going to try using my Beauty Blender and
see
I can tell a difference so let's see
what happens I'm just going to apply
that much a little goes a long way with
this which is nice
so you don't need to use a lot of it so
it is all on I'm trying to see if I
notice a difference I'm going to drag
this down a little bit I really love how
this looks now
definitely I'm going to finish the face
and see how this wears so just do a soft
little glam and see how it sits but I
really really like it
this is actually way better than I
expected
I've tried the original infallible and
it just wasn't for me I love that this
says it's for normal and dry skin
because I'm very normal skin now the
test is gonna be when I do concealer and
powder how well it sits so I think we
can take a little concealer what do we
want to use today oh oh I got the new
Too Faced Born This Way concealer let me
go grab it well I found it okay so to
face just put out this Born This Way
concealer I'm like hi good morning
so dope concealers are hard for me
because I love to be really really white
under the eyes so there's three colors
here there is very fair fair and then
light now of course on camera they
probably all look the same now the very
fair one is really white like this one
is like really really really light so I
think I'm gonna go with the one maybe
shade darker so I'm just gonna go with
fair let me keep it safe maybe I'll try
very fair in one of my next videos this
concealer is dope it says that there is
coconut water in there to replenish the
skin's moisture levels uh-huh sign me up
and then there is Alpine rose to
brighten and boost skin's radiance and
then hyaluronic acid for smoother more
youthful appearance well I think I'm
ready for this now everyone is talking
about this and saying how it's amazing
so I'm like okay let's give it a whirl
love it almost looks like it's like a
nude lipstick let's just see what
happens
I'm gonna put a lot under my eye oh wow
has an interesting smell it's difference
like it's very fresh now sometimes it's
foundation this concealer can mess it up
but this
looking good just a little bit on my
chin and then yes forehead
come on let's draw a Christmas tree in
my forehead come on Santa Claus I'm just
gonna use my Beauty Blender wow that
blended so quick and it's like oh come
on writing now let's try this this
mobile world's whirring now I chose the
shades you can actually see the pigment
of the product since my foundation is
darker than usual today and right off
the bat I'm like yes
Too Faced is like killing it lately you
guys I mean not lately they've always
been killing it but like they've really
been murdering the makeup game right now
I'm like come on usually you guys I know
right off the bat if I like something
because I've been playing with makeup
for so long and I gotta say this
concealer is unreal I'm like wow it's
like and this side of my forehead for a
minute didn't dry weird it let me blend
flawlessly and I'm like whoa my under
eyes are feeling really youthful today
honey I'm like ooh okay usually I would
add a little more I don't want to add
anything I'm like loving this so okay hi
this might be my new favorite concealer
let's see how it wears I don't want to
be too quick to judge and say it's my
new favorite but it might be my new
favorite alright so I think I am going
to set the under eyes I'm gonna use my
Laura Mercier translucent setting powder
and I just like to dunk my Beauty
Blender in there damp and let's see what
happens now if you have dry skin you
really don't want to set it with that
much powder because it's just gonna make
you really dry under the eyes and we
always want to look really youthful and
airbrushed so this is not always the
best technique for everybody just
because it is trending right now now I
love this because it just melts right
into your skin it's a little trick I've
been doing for a minute under eyes are
set that concealer you guys I'm like
room room I am really feeling it now I
think it's only fair that I cover my
entire rest of my face with some Georgia
Armani luminous soap powder foundation
and I'm going to be dipping in with this
old-school Mac brush come on
bristle hairs look at that girl I've had
this for about 15 years this is an old
school Mac brush called the won 8-6 if
you used to work at Mac or you do and
even a employee for a long time you're
gonna be like oh my god bitch where the
hell did you find that this is in the
archives honey I watched her up and I am
gonna just put this everywhere this is
such an amazing brush I think I need to
recreate it because I don't have
anything like this anymore
all right Wow so all in all I think it
got lucky and picked a really good
combination today I'm like come on I'm
usually not a fan of drugstore
foundations you guys all know that but
this is really really dope even with the
concealer over it and now this
foundation my skin is just late it's set
it is ready to conquer the world so I
think I'm going to finish getting ready
and go drive around for a little bit and
I'll be right back
you know let's show a little highlight
because it's like watching porn to me so
I'm just gonna pull out my Burberry nude
gold highlighter this has been really
used lately I'm like good morning I
found this on Sephora or you can get on
Burberry comm and as usual I'm just
gonna go in with my morphe 510 brush and
just go in now because my foundation is
a little darker today this shade is
going to be perfect did you have a
lighter one though where you pale ass
bitches but for now this should be oh
yeah this is perfect now I'm just gonna
take a little powder brush and soften
that nose cuz I don't really want people
to crash on the freeway when they
glanced over at me and my nose is like
beaming off the Sun that's still pretty
intense mm-hmm it my grandma's like
hi bitch can you I like my
Cupid's bow sorry girl all right I'm
going to finish up this face and I'll be
right back all right my makeup is done
for the day the foundation is still
looking full Ollis you guys literally
flawless I'm actually shocked I'm
shocked nothing I want to hate drugstore
makeup but this is
amazing so L'Oreal anyone networks airs
watching this I love the sound ation so
I think we're gonna give this a really
high rating now I am going to go drive
around I have some errands to do and a
bunch of stuff so I think I think we
have a winner now I know you guys are
all gonna ask this lip is the new
Smashbox liquid lipstick chill zone I
love it it's like a cooler darker
version of Scorpio this is like a real
grey with no purple to it and I love it
the formula is really really nice so
alright Smashbox ICU so a lot of new
stuff in this video today alright I
think I am going to go do my errands
drive around and then I will be back in
like four or five hours and we'll see
how this looks
alright guys they just got back from
running errands me Nate went out to
dinner so my look at great lipstick she
came off anything with oil always breaks
down a liquid lip so when you're eating
on mozzarella sticks it's gonna come off
so I just thrown some gloss but the
foundation is really really amazing like
it held up really great there are little
cracks on my smile line which is very
natural when you get stoned and laugh
all the taste so besides the
little fine lines everything is great
it's actually really great so we are
going on what time is it I've had this
on for about seven and a half hours
which I don't normally wear foundation
longer than eight so for me this is a
total win I am really happy with lore'l
and hi the word glow it trapped me in
and it worked so I am so happy to say
that the infallible Pro glow foundation
is Jeffery star approved if you guys

impressions then let me know in the
comments below
I love reviewing stuff because I just
keep it real if it works it works if it
sucks it sucks so it's a win so if you

one bye guys
