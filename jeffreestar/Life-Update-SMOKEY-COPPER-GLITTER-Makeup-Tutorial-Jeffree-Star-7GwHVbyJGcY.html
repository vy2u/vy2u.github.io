channel now it's been a week since I've
posted a new video and I'm like I miss
everyone I really do I'm just gonna fill
you in on what's been going on so for
the last month I've been traveling a lot
me and Manny anyway we have been
together we went to New York for the
Urban Decay event and we got to meet
Ruby Rose oh my god so hot so beautiful
and so like just down-to-earth so it was
such a cool moment that we got to all be
flown out for that event
and then right after that we went to
Vegas where we had the benefit brow
launch which was so fun me and Manny had
the best time ever in Vegas and then we
had one day off then we literally had to
repack our whole suitcase and then we
went back all the way to New York for
the Jacqueline Hill Becca cosmetics
launch which was so fun like Jacqueline
if you're watching this I am so proud of
you your palate is so gorgeous it's
amazing and if you guys want to see me
do a little champagne glow collection
video where I swatch and use all the
highlighting stuff let me know in the
comments down below so after that New
York trip me and Manny got back here and
I was like girl I am jet-lagged
now today is such a big moment because
my highlighters and my first ever
eyeshadow palette got released this
morning so if you're watching this and
you're like oh my god that came out you
better pause this video and go get it so
I had a little setback two days ago
which is so crazy because I'm like oh my
god this is like the biggest launch of
my brand so um I get home I'm on the way
to the office a few days ago and I was
going through a light and someone
decided to try to gun it and turn left
without yielding and waiting for me so
if they smash into my car for the car
that got hit was my dream car I was so
excited to get you guys if you don't
know what a BMW i8 is look it up it is
like the best BMW you can buy and I was
like oh my god like I can't believe I
finally I'm able to get something that
I've wanted for such a long time so a
few days ago it was such a surreal
moment because the car's totaled and I
couldn't believe that I got to walk away
from that with like just a few scratches
air bag and from being jolted so right
now my body isn't like severe pain for
like where this like where the seatbelt
was and my back fully hurts but I am
healthy and alive and I got to walk away
from it so I'm like you know fuck the
car I'm just glad that I get to go home
to my family and my dogs you know that's
what was most important to me but it's
crazy when you just have a full like
realization about life where it's like
great so I got to buy something that I
wanted it literally means nothing if I
can't be on this earth to enjoy it so it
was really like I'm still rattled from
it I'm shook from it it's scary if
you've ever been in a car accident I
know you guys can relate to that if you
haven't I hope it never happens to you
because it is so scary besides that life
is beautiful I can't believe I am
sitting here healthy I have my
highlighters out in my palette and it's
like I've been working on those things
for like nine to ten months so the fact
that it's finally all out and ready to
be shipped to you guys is like such a
like it just feels crazy because I'm
like I'm not gonna let something to turn
me from my dreams and my goals and doing
makeup is what I love the most so do I
want to be on vicodin sitting in bed
right now honestly no so I'm like you
know what I need to film a video for you
guys it's been a minute so today I am
recreating a look I did for one of my
beauty campaign ads and I am wearing one
of my new lipsticks and I'm doing a full
glitter glam glitz moment today so if
you want to know how I created all this
keep on watching if not pause the video
and still break my heart all right guys
keep on watching alright now for this
look you really don't need any eye
primer because the glitter is gonna go
over your entire lid but I am still
gonna put down a white base from my brow
bone all the way to my lash line now
what am I gonna use today it's only
fitting that I use my own palette so I'm
gonna go in with my shade China white
from the Beauty killer palette now this
palette you guys don't sleep on it so
I'm just gonna tuck this from brow bone
all the way down
I draw my brows a little extra high
today because the beauty about having no
brows is you can then add more room for
foundation so I'm just going to take a
little synthetic flat brush and I'm
going to coat this all over my eyes so
this is going to be kind of like my base
so just find a shade that fits your skin
tone and start blending that
motherfucker so you can use any shade
that fits you if this is too light for
you just grab a color from any palette
and just make sure it's light enough
because we are going to blend some
shadows out and this will definitely be
a big help and as always I'm going to
take this and just take it past my brow
all the way back come on drama alright
that shadow is blended out now it's time
to move on to the violet Voss Holy Grail
palette this one I've been using this a
lot off-camera it is just such an easy
palette for on the go and when I created
my rich blood ad I wanted really dark
sultry copper eyes I'm gonna be going in
with this family today so right off the
bat hashtag one of my favorite
transition colors so I'm just gonna grab
a little brush and we're gonna get to
work here I'm just gonna take my Mac
two-two-four as always you guys know I
have like thirty of these and my kit
cannot live without it and we're just
going to take this transition color and
I'm just going to put it like in my
crease we are going to put a lot of
glitter here so you definitely want to
make sure you have shadow showing above
all that so I'm just going to start
tucking that in my crease and blending
outwards now this look I'm definitely
going to be bringing this down we want
this really dramatic so I'm going to
take this and kind of bring it into my
nose contour so if you look from the
side we're just going to drag this up
and out and we're going to make it look
really flawless so I'm definitely going
to raise this up a little higher so
notice this gap in between here this is
going to give you that illusion of a
bigger eye so we're just going to start
there
and start blending and blending now I'm
going to bring this out a little bit
past my eye so we get a full dramatic
effect today and I'm going to take that
and just kind of keep it right around
there so don't bring a too far out we're
going to keep it right there because we
want a full smoky eye now if you really
want this lineup here really seamless
you can take a small little blending
brush sometimes I'll take that
two-to-one or you can go back in with
your same blending brush but this I've
been loving lately where you just kind
of take a little bit of your light color
so we'll dip into there and then you
want to take that light color and just
kind of go over the lines and blend them
out now you don't have to use a
different brush you can use your same
flat one but this one gives it that
really nice like soft finish alright now
we got the transition color complete we
are blended and blended out I mean you
can really blend too much I'm just gonna
dip into God there's just so many
options this wine and dine color is so
sick and then this teddy bear color so
at first I'm just gonna go into this
wine and dine really softly so we're
just going to you know coat the brush a
little bit and I'm gonna actually go
right in to that crease and look down
this is gonna add some dimension to this
look already you can see it's like oh
hello sunset mmm BAM now I'm not going
to bring it down here I'm going to keep
it there because we are remember putting
glitter on the whole lid so there's
really no point to do that and then I'm
going to take that same brush we dipped
into hashtag and dip into wine and dine
one tube the little so little hair in
there and then we're gonna blend out
that color now if you think the red is
too harsh you can always use a brown but
I think it makes us look so unique
everyone does like the same transition
colors it's like the same basic taupe so
I think this adds a little flair to it
now when these colors merge they just
look really really pretty together
before we get to the glitter I
definitely want to do underneath my eyes
already because I don't want to go back
and deal with it and have to clean up a
lot of glitter so let's smoke out the
under eyes alright we're going to take
my favorite Mac smolder eye pencil this
is such a good black first muggin out
and creating that smoky look so as
always and if you're new to my channel I
love using a beauty blender to pull down
my eyes I always see girls pulling and
tugging and girl I'm not trying to look
a hundred years old already so we're
just gonna barely just watch you see
that that's all you need so all you
girls that are pulling and tugging your
your lids oh my god stop it right now so
we're just gonna pull down slightly and
we're just gonna run this black liner
through the waterline quickly now this
does not have to be perfect because we
are going to smudge it out and we just
want that black to stay there so I'm
going to go back and forth back and
forth now of course if your eyes get
watery easy you want to you know be a
lot more quicker than me I work contacts
and I've been poking my eyes for ever so
I think my eyes are definitely used to
the abuse but I made it smoky and kind
of messy on purpose remember we are
gonna go back over that so let's do the
other side we'll quick oh right come on
smolder looks like I was just blowing
someone and my eyes were crying alright
thanks Nathan first color I'm going to
use in here is called cranberry splash
it is this amazing like burgundy frosty
color and then there's this one called
on fleek which I'm actually going to mix
it with some is going to be dotting back
and forth want to take this brush this
is a Tom Ford brush every brand has a
thin pencil brush so you want to take a
brush like that really nice and we're
just gonna
take it and press it over that black and
you're basically going to use it as a
tool for smudging so I'm going to take
this color and I'm just going to start
dragging it and bringing it down a
little bit so notice how I'm blending
that color over the liner so it's like
mixing together it's having a baby right
now and that's it you got just got to go
back and forth back and forth so I'm
just gonna go back forth between these
two and you're just gonna keep going
with a really steady hand and you're
just gonna blend over that it's really
no crazy secret it just makes it look
really airbrush which you guys that's
what I'm all about this look has a lot
of back and forth it's really not that
hard you just got to be meticulous and
careful to add more we're going to take
this brush this is another little Mac
two to one I have like 20 of these in my
brush set so we are going to take this
one we're just gonna go right to this
color cult on fleek and I'm just going
to coat that brush this is what I used
in that ad to get that extra smoky look
so if you don't just want that cranberry
color we're just gonna lightly go over
with on fleek and this is like a more
Brown based cranberry I'm just gonna go
back and forth and it's gonna really
bring out that color ooh yes alright now
that the bottom is really smoked out
it's time to smoke ten bongs just
kidding we got to do the glitter so the
glitter is actually really easy
violet Vaz has their own glitter
adhesive and they make really sick
glitters so it's kind of a two birds
with one stone
so this is a glitter adhesive I'm just
going to put it on my entire lid and
coat it with a little synthetic brush
and we're just gonna take the same brush
and press the glitter on top of it now
this is also from violet vos this is
called copper Ella it is one of my
favorite glitters ever I love a good
copper so we're just gonna take this
glitter adhesive a little glitter and
we're just gonna put it only where I
want glitter so I'm going to take it and
bring it all the way down like that
picture and
and over the entire lid now you do got
to act quit you do not want to just let
this sit and dry glitter glue works
quickly so what I like to do is just
pour some glitter into the cap and we're
just gonna press down on this so this
will be completely coated let's go to
town oh my god hmm I'm already obsessed
and now don't worry about the glitter
hitting your lashline or your real
lashes we're gonna cover that all up
momentarily you guys see there's only
barely any fallout on my eyes I'm just
gonna kind of brush out I'm just being
really careful it's almost like doing an
eye lift you just got to be really
careful now if your eye doesn't look
like a disco ball you gotta you know
keep adding more on let's coat our
bottom and top lashes and get them ready
oh Lord
all right mascara is done now I need to
definitely do some false lashes because
this look would not be complete without
her so let me go rummage through my
drawers and I'll be right back for
lashes I'm going to use the exact pair I
wore in the rich blood ad and these are
Russian black from new bounce um oh hi I
have mascara all over me listen I love
reusing lashes so if you or someone that
doesn't really do that always it gonna
do is pull the glue off from the last
use which can be really awful with these
long nails but um cool I got it pretty
much all off so I'm just going to be
using my Eschete Oh lash glue and we're
just gonna coat that entire lash line
and get these on my arms get on me get
on me
now I've been putting a little lash glue
on my eye already so it's kind of like
prepping it and it's really been helping
them not come off because you never know
what the day is going to bring you right
so we are just going to wait for using a
little bit tacky and then we'll pop them
on ashes are done I am pretty obsessed
with this look already I'm like mmm
these lashes I think really complete it
so now it's time to get some highlight
on these damn cheekbones I'm gonna be
using my own skin frost highlighter
today to match this whole warm tone
smokey eye and my favorite which I get
asked all the time
girl I use this in every video the
morphe M 510 this one it's a game
changer for your cheekbones so I'm going
to be using this too it's gonna match
everything on my face today I didn't
want to go to gold I didn't want to go
to like light so we're just going to
take this highlight and place it right
on the top of our cheekbones and right
above our contour and I'm going to bring
this all the way back to the hairline so
my face is just shining and it's like a
lighthouse just got planted on my
cheekbones and I'm gonna blend it down
so it goes into my contour and just
really goes into the skin so you want to
really finesse this in boom hmm like I
could watch a highlight being applied
all day every day see that brush hit the
skin it's like watching porn mmm your
cheeks should look like peach glass by
now if they do not um you might need to
reapply some more cheekbones are there
they're flaky ooh yes now as usual I'm
gonna take some of this and do my
Cupid's bow like stream no since I
contoured my nose I'm really thinly I'm
gonna take my fingertip and I'm just
going to lightly dab in there and we're
just gonna do a little
right here and then I'm gonna drag this
brush up so my nose looks like it's
sweating metal now I'm noticing under my
brow bone it could definitely have a
little bit of shine so I'm just gonna
take this same blending brush from
earlier get off some of that powder and
I'm gonna take it and just lightly run
it through I'm gonna just place it right
below this brow so we're just gonna put
it halfway there so I'm not gonna bring
it all the way over I'm just gonna kind
of start it right here like just that
extra detail to really bring out the
eyes cute so now the only thing we're
missing here is a lips today come on we
have to do bridge flood since we are
mimicking the make it bad so this color
is brand new it is a permanent shade in
my line and it does have find Micah's of
glitter so you can see that in daylight
or when the flash hits your mouth kind
of looks like ruby slippers hi Dorothy
so we're just gonna apply this all over
the Oh mm-hmm
this is like a ruby red a lot of people
were asking what's the difference
between this and last year's holiday
collection when I did the hobo ho color
that was a lot more like warm tone where
this is definitely a cool toned red so I
think it looks good with that contrast
of the eye all right
lips are drying whoo this red lip just
took this look to a whole nother level I
am loving this so let's let the lip dry
definitely need some setting spray and
I'm a little depressed because my Urban
Decay all nighter definitely left that
and it was New York trip on the sink
somehow I never leave anything in my
hotel so I don't know what that F
happened so we're just gonna go in with
our really how do you today you guys
well we're just gonna go old-fashioned
and use our mac fix+ and even though
it's not my favorite for setting the
entire face that's all I got
oh definitely hydrating but whoo I'm
like I'm literally gonna drive this
Sephora
right after this well Nathan will be
driving but um you know what I mean
all right so now that the six plus is on
why am i adding a more highlight I don't
even like me to do that I just can't
help it oh my god what look okay you
guys I think this look is definitely
complete I could add more and more and
more because I have really bad highlight
OCD but I'm gonna stop and put the
brakes on it right now so let me go
throw on some clothes and complete this
look and I'll be right back all right
this is the final look I'm like what's
up girl I'm ready to go to Walmart and
fucking hit the club but I had so much
fun creating this look I hope that you
guys recreate this one especially for
summer even this is technically like a
fall look I want to be gothic in the
summer I just want to just wear as much
eye shadow as possible so I hope you
guys loved this video I'm gonna be
reviewing a lot of stuff coming up in
the next few weeks so get ready and I'll
see you guys on the next one
