channel all right guys today we're going
to dive into you another liquid lip
swatch a video yes another brand is come
out with liquid lips and they are
reformulated they're brand new
the colors are actually pretty dope I'm
really excited today because we're going
to be testing out the new MAC Cosmetics
retro liquid lip color now there is a
million colors I know the caps are hard
to see so we're just going to flip them
upside down they have so many new colors
that just came out so we got a fistful
of newness right here in my hand and I'm
really excited about this because let me
just tell you why now I'm sure a lot of
you were like Jeffrey Mac put out liquid
lip colors last year these aren't new to
meet our new because let me just keep it
really real as usual I try to feel them
last year the formula was not really
consistent with the colors it's very
like all over the place so I am happy to
announce that I think they reformulated
their liquid lips because they haven't
put out any new shades in a while and
they just dropped a bunch of new so
I was like okay you know what I think
I'm finally going to give Mac a chance
of course you guys know I am a Mac whore
I mean I used to work in Mac I always
used some other stuff their staple I
mean I don't know how many years I think
we're talking on about 15 years now
where I've been using the Mac Studio Fix
foundation powder I just can't stop like
it is everything and the formula really
works for my skin so that's been like a
tried-and-true for me
so when I saw that they launched a bunch
of new colors I was excited because I
see some teals some really dark colors I
mean hi this is crazy and crazy in a
really good way because I love funky
colors and have a lot of really
beautiful nudes like he's really great
on nude Mac is back on trend girl so I
know a lot of people have had so many
thoughts and hit or misses with its
formula so allegedly did reformulate I
don't want to quote Mac because
obviously don't work for them and I
don't know the realty but a lot of
people had said that they have changed
it and updated it so we are here to put
them to the test so if you want to see
me swatch the new Max retro matte liquid
lips colors and keep on watching all
right before we get the swatch thing I'm
going to give you guys a little bit of
info about this product now you all know
I'm logging
- mac cosmetics calm all right so this
says for those who prefer a timeless
glamour to an all-out flash the matte
reigns supreme
max introduces a twist on this classic
texture with robustly saturate shades of
retro matte liquid lip color
whichever shade you choose all promises
one thing a splash of color any liquid
suede finish that is impossible to
forget here's what really gets my
interest because I want to know where
product claims to do so then I can
really see does it do that
so this said that is long where it's
supposed to last eight hours the color
words evenly in smoothly eight hours
again okay we have two eight hour claims
here and then it says it provides a stay
true color and non feathering and a non
bleeding formula okay that's interesting
so before I think that we're kind of
streaky not that great so I feel like
this better really do what it says whole
group now it says usage on how to apply
it it says apply directly onto your lips
using applicator girls alright so I
think it's time to dive into these
swatches now one thing I do want to read
on the bottom here is that I would get
like you know how much product is in one
of these this one says there's five
milliliters which is a 0.17 fluid ounces
that's pretty normal for a liquid lip so
the first shade we're going to try is
this grey type of dark grey Brown and
this shade is called simply smoked I'm
lying so when you take a quick
break
wooo alright so first of all let's open
this bad bitch up she's never been used
before look at that virgin one baby
don't play me and oh oh all right so the
doe foot applicator is more of a not a
triangle but it does have a point which
is nice too of course draw on the lines
for the lips now and has that classic
vanilla II kind of plastic cake smell
that Mac has had forever which I kind of
laugh at reminds me of being in junior
high
hmm its pleasant alright let me just
grab a mirror here and let's see what
happens that went on pretty opaque now
there's not that much color left on the
applicator it gets a little yeah I'm
going to do one more jump which reports
is a very normal
let's give our little twist all right
I'd like to get fully opaque coverage I
am going to go in for a third time just
for that little outer corner because I
did lose a little bit of the pigment
once I went really in let's go in one
more time okay let's let this dry for a
second it's actually drying really
quickly which I love because I hate a
lipstick that takes forever to dry all
right here is simply smoke all dry now I
will say one thing the coverage was full
it went on really nicely we smile
there's no crazy lines yet obviously
it's only on my mouth for a few minutes
but and it's full coverage which is a
lot better than when I first tried
anything to a time interval but I just
feel like a date again exam pleasantly
surprised right now
now one thing it just feels a little
drawing but it's a liquid list it's
obviously going to feel a little more
driving than normal lipstick but it's
not like if I could dessert in my mouth
is like turning continents it just goes
a little little dry but nothing like
crazy very normal so let's try the next
color and see what happens all right
this next shade is called a young
attitude and I was actually really
excited to try it because in this bottle
it looks to be like a dark teal I don't
know as a young attitude was the right
shade for this usually what I think is
young in attitude I think it's really
pretty and soft in like Bay's or nudes
but hey I'm on this brand so um let's
see what this one looks like ooh wow
it's like really dark green of course it
smells the same and let's give this one
a whirl
all right I am dunking in a third time
again and this one on the monitor it
looks beautiful and it is flawless it's
just a little gummy in here which I've
just kind of had to finesse the wand
over a few times which is not like a big
you know deal-breaker for me a lot of
brandy I do that with so let's finish
this off all right this one is dry the
color is beautiful I think I'm living
for this one with this backdrop now only
complaint is that maybe because the
color is such a weird dark color there
is a little bit of streakiness if we're
going to zoom in right here real quick
just a little bit I did put on a kind of
like a second layer on top and it's kind
of sometimes a new layer liquid lips I
really don't like that they don't really
settle together but overall it is a
really beautiful color I just wish it
wasn't so mm for some reason darker
colors and I've noticed this with a lot
of brands it starts to get a little
weird so if you look here it's almost
like flaking off like into my mouth so
be careful if you are doing really dark
colors like this I'm going to Pat my lip
yeah just kind of it a little flakes on
my finger nothing too major but I would
probably wear this to like a photo shoot
or somewhere world was not going to be
out for a long time because I don't know
how this would really last but I will
try that out later this week all right
let's get on to the next color
all right now that it looks like I've
been sucking off an alien let's move on
to the next color now this did kind of
stain my lips I did take a Beauty
Blender with some foundation and Pat
around my mouth still a little stain so
we're going to power through it y'all
know what it is all right so this next
color is called burnt spice it is a
beautiful kind of like a light toned
nudie color with a little bit of mob in
there a little bit of rose so let's put
her on
alright something I didn't notice first
of all this color is beautiful I love
nude lipsticks but this one was a little
more opaque and what I mean by that is
that I really only dumped in once and I
did my entire mouth whereas the previous
shades we just tried I have it going
like three times so this one for
whatever reason has more pigment than
the other two shades which is a good
thing that is a plus this one actually
feels less drying than that first one
where'd she go then this guy so this one
is a less drying for whatever reason
it's when it sells a little bit more
like what's those nice and the cool
thing about these your lips don't stick
together thank God I don't know it has
some crazy experiences in the past cool
this one is it really pretty let's move
on oh my god you guys are tripping me
out because I put on that last color
wiped it off even put a little bit of
foundation over it and I still have this
green rim around my mouth imagine if you
would wear that for eight hours girl I
don't know it but it did stain a little
so be careful with that color because
I'm like what in the yeah so this next
color is a beautiful gray toned nude
this one is called a flesh tone and it
looks like it's just like a grayish nude
which I love right up my alley so let's
put her on
all right I love this color it looks
like a lot of lipstick that I already
own because I love nudes I love the gray
tone so this one is really pretty now
same thing with the last color really
one dumped covered my entire mouth so I
don't know what is up with the news is
there a little extra magic in here I
don't what the hell was going on but it
literally only took one dump with a wand
and I got a full opaque coverage which I
like which means on the bottle will not
run out quick so same thing this you
know has very consistent formula with
the rest of them I really like this
color
alright let's move on alright guys with
a few shades left now I'm going to try
this gorgeous brown nude color is called
so me vain bitch alright let's see what
this bad bitch looks like
girl I am loving this color these dark
moods though I don't know why I'm just
obsessed with them this color might be
one of my favorites that I've tried on
so far today and I really like this one
I'm like girl work now all the news I
mean just like I already said they went
on beautifully amazing one swipe
coverage is definitely the realty all
right I have one more watch for you guys
it's a really dark one so I'm excited
and let's get to it all right guys this
is the last one now this is a really
dark shade it almost looks Brown from
looking at it almost looks black but
it's like a dark purpley pink now this
one is called uniformly fabulous and
let's see what happens all right I am
pleasantly shocked you guys because so
many brands I've had an issue with
really dark colors for some reason out
of its the formula mixing with the
pigment it doesn't really translate a
lot of times they kind of like chip off
on your teeth or tongue even that green
one was getting a little weird this one
for some reason nothing's wrong it's
really fully opaque I didn't have to go
over at five times I get over and over
and it looks really nice I'm like okay
honey like work I really like it I'm
like when I said pleasantly surprised
I've just had so many bad experiences in
the past with other brands usually it's
really hard to pull off that dark dark
color now it is not streaky it's just a
little bit weird here which you're
probably barely going to even see on
camera I'm probably could take a lip
brush and go over it very slightly but
I'm really happy with this color Wow
okay Mac I think it's time to give my
final thoughts all right so my final
thoughts on these I just went downstairs
for a minute I drink a Red Bull I
chilled out for a second amazing a few
kids and this stayed on really great I'm
like Emma like girl it's there I'm like
okay I need um I was a little wary of
this because you go home tonight a
little bad experience last year but
thank you Mac for him
your formula for your liquid lips
they're actually pretty great and all
the colors went like went on amazing
they were fully opaque they smelled nice
the coverage was their only thing of
course was that chillin stained a little
bit high
liquids obtained sometimes it happens
it's not like it's Mac's fault every
brand has a color that is stain my mouth
before so that is not only a callin in
my book I will say this
definitely more strategy lips very well
before applying I always like to do lip
balm like 10 or 15 minutes prior to a
liquid lip so it soaks in you never want
to put on something right before because
it is going to counteract with a formula
it is not going to be long wearing and I
still like a lot of people kind of
forget that sometimes so these are
Jeffrey's are approve gigantic and I
don't really like them so thank you guys
so much for watching this video and let
me know your thoughts down below what
was your favorite color do you think
they're approved are they approved by
you guys I definitely think that Mac
stepped it up with these and I'm excited
for them to release more colors so
hopefully they do that throughout the
year and I was a really pleasantly
surprised how many times I gotta say
that but for real I was a little shook
shocked and shaken and I don't know what
this dark look I feel like I'm about to
go suck some blood or suck some insert
here all right you guys thank you so
much for watching another watchi video
and I will see you on the next one
mwah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
