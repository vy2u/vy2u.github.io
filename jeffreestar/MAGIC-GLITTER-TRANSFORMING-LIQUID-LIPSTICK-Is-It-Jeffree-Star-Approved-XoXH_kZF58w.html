channel alright today we're gonna dive
into some glitter some liquid lips and I
guess they're gonna be combined and some
crazy magical is supposed to go
down now I have been in Michigan for a
few days so girl she's back and I'm
ready to roll today we're going to dive
into something that I've seen all over
the internet and it is the ciate london
glitter flip liquid lipsticks now I had
to try this for myself because they kind
of went viral and Instagram everyone was
talking about it and I like Jeffrey try
it out let's see if they're jeffree star
approved so when I got these in the mail
I was like okay I'm gonna save them I'm
gonna try them a lot of the times I get
so giddy and excited I will try things
before filming with them and then I'll
be like okay I already tried it not
filming it so these I was like okay
we're gonna put them aside and here we
are so today we are going to dive into
them I actually have all the colors here
but I feel like if most of them work do
we need to try all the damn shades I
know at home you guys are like my mouth
is saying no so we will do 5 out of
these 7 but I do have them all here and
I guess basically if you want to see me
try these out - keep on watching alright
so they all of course come in these unit
cartons and there is of course I just
said it's seven shades and they all
retail for and nineteen dollars a piece
I think that's pretty fair for this type
of brand now on this side of the box it
says that this is a transforming glitter
liquid lipstick now I don't really think
this has ever been done before as far as
this type of formula so you know I love
when a brand makes something that is not
out yet so this says glitter lips made
easy with cia's a glitter flip simply
press lips together and watches metallic
matte liquid lipstick magically
transforms into a dazzling multi
dimension glitter lip with none of the
mess and a fraction of the time of a
traditional glitter lip look now of
course we all know when you want to do a
glitter lipstick you put down a normal
base you take glitter in a pot you take
it and you press it on your mouth now
over time does that look good
no because after 10 minutes it's all
over your face it's just a mess and it
doesn't really last throughout the day
if you go to eat with that goodbye
this extra sounds are pretty cool
literally
apply dry press and pop so it sounds
pretty easy to do this product says that
it has zero point one zero one fluid
ounces okay and let's open it up and see
what's inside all right okay so the top
of it is glitter and this reminds me of
the Mack mariah carey collection anyone
else got that last year very similar but
the packaging is cute we got the stars
on there we have the logo of course and
this shade is called candy okay so I
think um do I want to try the pink first
I kind of want to try this crazy purple
this because I have purple eyeshadow on
today so I'm just gonna unbox them all
and let's see if they work so I was just
reading on the website and I just want
to let everyone know that this product
is vegan it's cruelty free it's
formulated without gluten and this is
supposed to be a stay put formula with
non-drying and toward a little
comfortable wear will last all night
with no need for retouching well if
you're me you're gonna need some
retouching cuz bitch bra was on her
knees so this color is called fortune
and let's see if they smell like
anything crazy here is what the
applicator looks like it is kind of flat
has a little bit of an arch right there
and then let's see what they smell like
hmm not really anything which is
shocking cuz usually when there's
glitter in something it kind of smells a
little weird or a little intense but hmm
nothing all right so let's go in and see
what this is all about
oh okay coverage
all right so I dipped in once and I got
my entire bottom lip so let's finish her
off
all right here is the lipstick fully
swatched I must say I'm a little
surprised at how pigmented and full
coverage that went on like this looks so
pretty by itself of course I have not
pressed my lips together whatsoever yet
and you do see that there is already
shimmer and a little bit of the metallic
hue over the lip obviously it's a very
prominent right there and I really like
this color already now of course the
moment we've all been waiting for it
let's zoom in and press our lips
together and see what the is about
to happen so here we go one two whoa
okay that definitely activated a lot of
glitter let's do it a few more times oh
it's almost like a disco ball kind of
like that like blown on my mouth wow I'm
like hmm any of my teeth no okay you
guys so this definitely worked no ifs
ands or buts about it
I love this color here so I'm like okay
if you take your finger what happens if
you rub it I'm just curious
well nothing really comes off a little
bit obviously it maybe not be fully
fully dry yet but wow this is really
pretty I'm like ooh I think that these
are really light which is nice I was
afraid that there would be like too
thick but the lips don't feel like if
they're crunchy or that there's anything
really on them again when you close your
eyes and you're like it doesn't really
feel like there's that much in there
which is nice the glitter doesn't feel
chunky it's definitely sparkling I'm
gonna take my flash on my iPhone real
quickly here and let's put it on my
mouth and see hmm oh look at whoa okay I
might be obsessed with these let's try
another one the next shade is called
candy and it is this soft rosy pink I
thought let's try a lighter shade and
see if the glitter still activates as
strongly and then we'll move on so let's
give this color a whirl
all right let's see if candy has the
same metallic glitter moment it looks
very very match and there's not really
that much of a metallic sheen compared
to the first one we just did well let's
see right now whoa that is really pretty
I'm like oh okay I've never really seen
a formula like this so I am definitely
impressed and that looks really really
pretty
whoa okay this one is really cool
because it's the color subtle what the
glitter is stunning now I've been dying
to try this crazy mermaid teal color it
is called siren and close-up it has like
teal glitter on top of the teal so I
think this is gonna look pretty cute
let's see if the teal one works woah
holy huh
all right let's see if siren has the
same glitter effect which I think by now
we know because look how beautiful and
metallic that looks without pressing
together already I'm like who lowered
alright here we go
ooh this one packs a punch and it
definitely has a lot of glitter in it
which I love mm-hmm
okay this color is a really cool I know
it's a little edgy it's a little out
there so if you're someone that is a
little afraid of crazy colors I think of
course that last one candy would
definitely be good for you but this one
Lord Jesus I love it
alright the green stain my mouth a
little bit it looks like I've been
sucking off a dragon on Game of Thrones
but back to the pieces of watching this
one it looks to be like a crazy red with
like pink glitter it's called Hollywood
and let's see what she looks like
all right now this color by itself
before we even in glitter
Philippa tis so pretty I love the
undertone and that pink like metallic
who you already see the glitter wants to
come forward right in the fry it's like
let me out so let's let this dry for a
second and give her a spin all right now
let's give Hollywood a flip and see how
pretty it looks
oh that's silver that just came out with
the pink is spectacular this might be my
favorite maybe it's cuz my makeup I'm
not sure but I'm looking in the monitor
and I'm like what the hell this one is
obviously by now I think we know the
formula works the glitter looks so
pretty they all have of course different
hues of glitter different tones I'm
definitely really loving this formula so
we could stop here but then I saw this
one called iconic and it is a more
almost like a black version of this
purple one that we first swatch and it
has crazy amount of glitter in it so I
do want to keep this on but I will
swatch this one as well but don't do
this one's hot it last but not least we
are going to try iconic my mouth is
getting a little raw all the glitter and
the formula it does last Sonam we're
moving it in between takes you guys it's
a mess but we got one more to go so
let's see how does Kylie rocks holy
all right let's give this one a flip and
here we go whoa I'm like are we serving
some mermaid realness or what the blue
green and pink glitter undertones I'm
like holy hmm I don't know which
one's my favorite I'm sitting here
looking at the all the colors and I'm
like oh my god like look at the way this
glue door moves I'm like it's so
satisfiying damn it
all right you guys I think this is maybe
my second runner-up but I think the red
is stole the show for me I thought the
purple was like bomb as well and
the teal of course but this red one was
my favorite I think the glitter just
looked spectacular and I can't wait to
wear again now this finale though I'm
like looks like a fireworks on my mouth
and I'm loving every second of it all
right you guys I think it is time to
give my final thoughts now I wasn't sure
what I was getting myself into when I
first saw these but I'm pleasantly
surprised that ciate London Slade
killed deceased murdered this formula I
really loved it and if you guys have a
chance to pick up a few colors I highly
recommend the red and pink but if you're
a little more on the daring side wear
this wear to a wedding wear it to a
funeral and where to target but I'm
alright you guys I think it's no shocker
here that the CIA London glitter flip a
liquid lipstick is Geoffrey star
approved I am really really happy that
this brand is stepping it up and they're
trying new things and I can't wait to
see what they come out what's next all
right you guys thank you for watching
