channel today we are going to try out
some Korean skincare masks that we found
on the Internet
now I have seen this magnetic face mask
from a lot of Korean youtubers and it
looks so weird I'm like I'm gonna have
to try that and then I saw my girl bunny
aka a graveyard girl used it and I was
like okay we don't have to find one of
these so we found I know there's
different versions that just came out
but work okay so we're just gonna try
out a sheep mask for both of us and then
we're gonna move on to this quick
disclaimer
Nathan's contract ends with me soon so
he'll have to move back in with his wife
and baby when is it up like in six
months and he writes drats I mean having
someone's gate for pay is really
difficult to keep around you guys but
pretty hard you know I mean it's very
it's very up-and-down but hey at least
you're on a good salary and the
government's paying for my kids tuition
great I can't even take the internet
seriously just for the record in Nathan
has zero children and zero wives
- me and our $3 right and I guess people
just don't want to see people in love I
have no idea I know the majority of you
guys watching are so supportive and so
amazing so we're just poking fun at all
the Psychopaths that are flooding the
internet lately without further ado
without further ado should we get to
masking now we found these crazy sheet
masks now mine is called the baby pet
magic mask sheet anti-wrinkle hug I'm
excited to open this because I have no
idea what it looks like from the back of
the picture it looks a really funny now
my mask was only a few dollars and it
says after washing the face which we've
done open the pouch take out the mask
girl we fucking know how to do that
gently Pat the skin to promote the
absorb shouldn't have the residue okay
so we got to leave this on for 10
minutes and basically this one is
supposed to be an anti wrinkle firming
mask kind of okay
like baby's skin with its wrinkle
improvement essence girl we don't see
about this one I'll check that out and
then once you get baby I got the mummy
mud mask
okay and that's from my brain called
April skin and this one is from a brand
called Holika Holika clean your face
thoroughly and smooth the skin using a
facial toner okay we did that we are we
are toned thank you sizzle tone this one
was about five bucks all right well
let's open these I'm scared
we are prepped and already ready to go
so let's open these babies and see what
happens yeah
okay so first impression let's smell it
before we even look what's your smile
like my smell is it very fresh I don't
know it's almost like a can I tell maybe
like a little alcohol smell maybe like
champagne or like rubbing alcohol maybe
like champagne mmm mine smells really
like very fresh oh my god this is like a
dog it looks like a neutral oh my god
these are like yeah no I can't endure it
baton girl I'm gonna take my nails and
peel back oh my god there is so much
product on this which is a good thing
what that should just soak in how about
we put mine on and I'll help you put
yours on yeah I don't know what the hell
do I need help
alright it's my hair gonna get wet
whatever all right guys here goes come
on oh it's cold
come on pug oh my god look at these
brows though it was like almost look
like a little panda oh my god my hair
all 9 the mask is a little long so
obviously if you have a longer face
you're gonna be able to get all this
extra hanging but uh right now it just
looks like a medieval China yay the mine
is set and I won't let me set the timer
oh my god this is like a wet I'm just
gonna rub it on your chest alright let's
try your mummy mud mask oh my god looks
like a real mud look at this yeah no it
looks like there's just like a mud slab
inside of it looks like okay there's
like a protective film I remove the
transparent film from the upper mask
apply the mask on your face and peel off
the white mat oh I see so that comes off
oh my
okay let's do the site first so the
transparent comes off this is crazy you
guys is a lot of money so I apply this
to your face and then we peel off the
white but why okay we should see my hair
good you're good yeah oh my god I want
to make sure you can see our eyes look
at me and then you're supposed to peel
off this white thing this is so bizarre
my little mummy man hmm where does this
mask exactly supposed to do the more you
wait with a mask on your face the more
effective it is for the poor care oh
this is all about pores perfect
all right bottom half it's hard to talk
to you guys it's so wet feeling it's so
bizarre this is a really good look for
us so weak members of Slipknot now where
does that match your hair or like really
too good little it's a little cold I
feel like he's probably about the same
as yours
yeah not imagine feels fine like it's
mines like kind of hard to talk yeah
mine's a little hard to talk I feel like
you'll rip it all most of you open your
mouth too much
aren't you guys well we're gonna go hit
the bong and we'll be back in 15
alright guys so it's been 15 minutes
mine feels really cold definitely like
at every like sheet mask I've tried
before like I said like from ski or
anything like that it feels like
identical to that so should we peel mine
off let's do it okay
check you for head first feeling come on
hug mask oh my god it's like leftover
makeup from last night oh I bet I got it
all up okay why at least we did
something right alright okay so
obviously you guys do my face is very
glossed over it with the skincare now
what did the stay in the back I'm a
horrible listener gently Pat skin to
promote the absorption Pat are just like
panning around usually you guys
people say to rub in the access because
it just really helps it and it's just
wasted product if you wipe it off so
we'll just pop this into the skin
meaning rubbing I thought we're good
patting my skin I'm like
someone's gonna let these juices be on
my face for a minute all right so we got
15 more minutes of natives from punky
masks so uh go grab a red board we'll be
right back all right guys it's been 30
minutes my skin is still kind of glowing
I'm like hmm now before we take yours
off first impressions on mine my skin
does actually feel kind of like tighter
up here for some reason like my four is
kind of like oh my god okay what's going
on that blink pills are really smooth
and really nice obviously we'll have to
see what happens later tonight but I'm
what fill yours off let's do let's do
the top see if it goes all of it so it
says to take a washcloth and just remove
off the excess so let's do that so how
does it feel anything no I mean it feels
it feels fine I mean it's a little a
little tight right now cuz it's like
dried mud feels yep and came off feels
good wiping it off all right you are
good or skins like yeah all right and
then it says two-tone so we're just
gonna use the lemare of the tonic and we
love these cotton pads from Walgreens
they're our favorite ones for toning I
love that big area get everything please
hmm why aren't those kind of residue I
know I should probably leave it on but I
can't leave it on but wait we're gonna
do the other mask
I lied I'm gonna I'm gonna wipe this off
I'm sure people would be like oh my god
you shouldn't try to Matt's on one day
they both do different things and I look
at the ingredients and nothing's gonna
counteract and do anything wild and if
it does well you all get to see it all
right so how do you feel about yours
yeah it's pretty good I feel like it
looks a little red afterwards but I
think it's just my skin reacting from
wiping it so much the same mine is a
little bit red
in this area and kind of on my forehead
which happens with masks okay we're
gonna go take a quick little break go
let out the dogs and we'll be right back
all right you ready to dive into the
magnetic sound the box is intimidating
it looks like like your ashes after the
funeral comes alright so this says this
is by a brand called milky dress and
this is from Korea and it says moist and
shiny colorful luminous bypass let's
open it if it was really heavy which is
nice I love a face product that is very
heavy alright so it comes with all of
these items the face mask I'm guessing
this is the this is the magnet to remove
the mask and then it comes with like a
little spatula looks like a shoehorn for
an infant and this is probably to put
the punch all of your face horribly now
this mask is $54 so she's up there with
with normal skin care black and soft mud
from the Dead Sea contains 24 rich
minerals such as magnesium calcium
bromide ions potassium my god so I guess
this just has a bunch of good stuff
that's supposed to be good for your skin
so basically I guess we're gonna put
this on we're gonna let it have a moment
and then you take the mag I guess the
magnet and it removes all the dirt and
oil from your pores in primitive skin
tone deep cleansing moisturizing all
right well I guess we should dive in
this and see what happens
alright so I guess we take the spatula
apply a thin layer let it dry for three
to five minutes and then the magnet is
gonna take it all off and then we have
to massage the remains or the remainder
of the product into your skin for a full
minute I'm gonna put your zone first
alright yeah check it out how does it
feel feels expensive huh yeah no it's
heavy it's nice looks cool it's like a
pretty almost just like onyx or like
black crystal that glass what happened
oh wow it's like great Oh more great for
you yeah all right I'm just gonna dip in
oh wow it's like thick all right I mean
even layer
it looks like silver metallic close up
you guys this is so crazy it's not
spreading around like a normal mask it's
like it's taking a second this is crazy
look it like it won't move - how do you
see that oh my god it's like moving
around it's a bizarre it's a bizarre
I don't even how to explain it like you
try to move the product around moron
shut haha like there's not a lot in
there shit
there there's enough for two people to
breathe oh my god okay look toward the
camera so you try to move the product
around look and then it like doesn't
move all the way like no need here was
eight back what it's all over the place
you gotta fucking like spread it more
okay but you can put it on me it doesn't
spread easy like you think you think you
know you're talking about but you barely
move it and it doesn't stick to the skin
alright this apply is it so bizarre I'm
just gonna dive in the air and oh I
flick the spatulas not that amazing no
yeah I feel like you're see what I mean
help comes up but look right here it
almost feels like sand now that I'm
putting on my face oh my god smell this
I didn't really even let the set settle
in yet it's like a guy deodorant or bad
Cologne alright I could yeah it's weird
alright masks are on we used a lot of
product then layer but it was really
difficult to move around and get even it
was kind of making me frustrated yeah
and I think we just gotta wait another
minute and then we can get to it yeah
now I gotta say there's no tingling
there's no burning there's no weird
feeling it just feels like just feels
like there's nothing in my face to be
honest it feels really weird it feels
really lightweight like you know with
other masks better like a sitting type
of mask like this usually it feels heavy
like there's cold cream but this was
really light it's tripping me out so we
are ready to take this off you want to
do me first
hmm so it says to put like a piece of
paper towel over the magnet
that's the magnet my plate should be
bigger yeah maybe a little bit bigger
okay I'm excited to see how this feels
let's uh I hit my face yeah shake it off
all right get ready hit me oh my god oh
it's crazy oh my god it feels it feels
like a pillow almost like a peel-off
mask yeah oh oh oh my God look at all
that oh it's off my face is there any
residue no not really there's a little
bit like a dot yeah a couple dots I
don't see any in the monitor or not you
know okay I do more good morning I
figured we probably want to switch your
paper yeah that's a lot of product okay
hmm yeah it's pretty intense oh my god
oh my god you can't wipe it off oh my
gosh how that looks so cool I wanna know
oh my god I was a trip okay so it's it
to rub in the oil after and I was like
okay how does it even make sense but it
has like this almost like a Vaseline
like texture but it's not really oily on
my fingertip just so bizarre but it
feels it feels good I'm just gonna roll
it in bread shocker
okay let's do Nathan now oh this is so
oh my god I for it feels fucking somebo
like this shit okay let me get a fresh
paper towel for you oh oh come on magnet
this is a hole
that's so weird sorry my paper towel
skills look janky everyone
though isn't this such a weird feeling
yeah and that's oily it is that's why
really yeah yeah it's like hot clay or
something play-doh
how does it feel pulling it off it yes
it's so weird all right all of the mats
is removed I guess let's rub it in it's
crazy
my leg feels like a new one yes like oh
my god baby
guess I'm feeling my stuff yeah it feels
great uh-huh
look what extra steam but we're not
someone's kind of really fresh kind of
like that guy cologne smell but not
really strong like I don't hate it I'm
not like this yeah no no it's very nice
oh my god okay okay let's give our skin
a minute to cool down and give our final
thoughts oh my god I'm tripping out I
feel like this isn't this is like a
magic trick and like people are playing
tricks on me but my skin feels amazing
it's like bizarre yeah I haven't felt
this good
we just paused and we did it on my
friend and my videographer and there how
do you feel how do you feel guys it was
really good it's crazy
um yours the blackheads are definitely
minimized like Nathan's nose looks
really clean your forehead is smooth oh
yeah
it's a little dry yeah my skin yeah okay
overall do it last final thoughts on
everything so the sheet masks kind of
gimmicky yeah they're just more for show
I would imagine yeah I'm sure there's
some sort of hydrating probably like
aspects to that but um it didn't Wow me
no um but this mask this mask is crazy
it feels so crazy coming off it's
bizarre it's the clothing I know that a
few other brands have recently came out
with these I have not tried those but I
definitely will this one can just be
purchased online if you
