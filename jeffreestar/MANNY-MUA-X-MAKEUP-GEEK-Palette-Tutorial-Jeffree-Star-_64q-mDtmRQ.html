know it's been a second since I've done
a full makeup tutorial so today I
thought listen um it's time today's look
I'm gonna give you some dramatic winged
liner I was looking through my videos
and I'm like damn I haven't done a wing
in a minute so here's a wing I will be
doing plenty of them for you guys so if
you want to know how to create this look
keep on watching alright let's get
started today I'm going to be using a
new Kat Von D beauty product this is the
Lockett color correcting eyeshadow
primer I got the lightest shade for me
now these are supposed to prime your
lids and also color correct in case you
have any dark circles ooh damn so I'm
just gonna take a little bit of this and
and now I'm just going to take a little
brush with no product and just drag that
around so we make sure it's evenly like
alright now the star of today's look is
BAM the many mua makeup geek
collaboration palette I am obsessed with
this out um hi
when I first saw it the red one Mars
immediately was like oh my god I love
all red eyeshadow I'm going to start off
this look by using some of the light
shades for blending purposes for my
transition color to start I'm going to
be using this ole Mac two to four brush
this is my favorite as you guys know and
I'm going to be dipping into frappe and
Sora and we're just going to mix these
two together and I'm just gonna put this
right in my socket and
lend the lend the lend now we are gonna
do a really dramatic wing today so I'm
gonna do really dramatic eye shadow I
mean it goes hand-in-hand right before I
get read for these lashes I've been in
Hawaii for a week I wore fake lashes
every day so my real lashes are pretty
janky right now I think I definitely
need to take a break on wearing makeup
but that's like removing my arms and
legs so hopefully my lashes will get
over it and not hate me too much now the
cool thing about these shadows as they
are really pigmented and they blend
quick so you don't have to spend a lot
of time blending it kind of does the job
for you all right now I'm going to take
this Mac to 1-7 brush and I'm gonna dip
right into Mars now a high pigment this
is like it's just a deep red I love
Red's every time I see red I'm just like
oh my god I'm gonna take this and
remember we are going to do a really
drastic black wing so I'm gonna take
this red I'm just gonna start putting it
in the crease and a little lower on my
lid as well so we can really smoke it
out and get that rusty dramatic effect
and I'm going to take it and go all the
way to the lash line just not all over
here we're just gonna stick it to most
you know the corners and then I'm gonna
go back in with that same brush and dip
into these just like and soften the line
and blend up now oh my god I felt like
Jesus just part of the Red Sea because
I'm obsessed with this look already okay
so now when I saw Luna this metallic
foil one right here I was like whew so I
am going to wet brush you can use any
synthetic little brush you want and I'm
going to dip into that one oh my god
listen here it's not even on my skin and
I'm like oh
and I'm going to take this and drag it
all the way to inner corner and half
white hand so it's like really blended
now you guys know I like to pack on
those metallic so I could have stopped
but you know I have an issue with that
so I'm just gonna keep on packing it and
I'm gonna also drag it a little bit down
here because you know we are gonna do
that bottom shadow eventually so I'm
just gonna start now and then of course
to blend you want to take Mars one more
time and just kind of Pat and blend in
that shimmer so it just flows nicely
together and notice how I'm just
connecting and popping that color right
in there course if you want your red
back one more time we're gonna go in
there and just kind of Pat it in and it
should create a little bilenda effect
because what I like to call it okay now
you can save the bottom shadow for later
I like to just do it now before the wing
okay before we add any more shadow let's
get to cutting that fierce wing alright
to get that crazy bitch I'm gonna kill
you wing liner I like to use two
products
I swear I'm sober I like to use two
products and that is the YSL babydoll
liner and then to fill in I'm going to
be using my Tarte black clay liner I
love this stuff this is like waterproof
it does not move to begin let's get the
black out now I love this because see
that see that bristle so then and it
just really helps you create your shapes
so let's start now I like to start from
kind of the middle and just create a
shape of what I want and I just kind of
start carving it out now I do want to
follow my lash line and create a natural
you know like a up angle and that's
where my wings gonna start does that
look beautiful right now hell no looks
like shit but I got it it has to start
somewhere so as the liner is drying I'm
gonna take some and just drag it up
now you definitely need to have a steady
hand so if you drink in too many Red
Bulls
or your adderall hasn't kicked in yet
just you know wait it out girl because
you really gotta focus on this part it's
a lot of back and forth I get asked all
the time what's a quick you know trick
for a wing and I'm like it really isn't
one I like to really get up close so let
me just use this palette has helped some
guidance wings take time so do not rush
this stiff or you're gonna regret it
okay so let's flip that back for a
second and now we're gonna go in with
our liner and you can use any little
liner brush you have this is a Sonia one
from Target I love how sharp that is mm
and I just like to dip in the pot hide
this a million times and then the
product dries fairly quickly so you just
want to get it on that damn wing and
blend now why didn't I just use the
liquid because this will really make
sure it stays all damn days there we go
just gradually adding and prata from
dragging up all right now I'm just gonna
clean up these edges old bring it out
even more hmm there we go
alright now that the wing is done before
we do lashes I am going to do a little
bit of light smoky on the bottom so
after that all right now for liner I
wanted to do like a weird burgundy
purpley kind of look now I know some
people don't like that they think it
makes them look - like drugged-out but
the first eyeshadow I ever wore was a
rusty red when I put it in my waterline
and I think everyone thought I was on
heroin or something but I'm having a
little flashback Friday so I'm gonna be
using the Rihanna Mac Talk That Talk lip
pencil for my eye
hopefully I don't go blind and if I do
is just the last time I'll ever see you
guys alright so you know what you know
what it is we're gonna use a Beauty
Blender and pull the eye Dan'l and then
this looks cool actually I'm like
being on this and bam easy of course I'm
going to butt out some of that with
eyeshadow so we are definitely not done
all right now I'm going to take a little
Tom Ford pencil brush and I'm going to
dip into Mars BAM
and then I want to do a little bit of
insomnia it's like such a pretty like
duochrome medal I got to try it
so first we're gonna take a little
pencil brush and we're gonna lightly
just drag under that liner now you can
obviously skip doing liner you can do
black liner you can do Brown you can do
anything you want so don't feel like you
have to do a red with this look I'm just
being a little you know have a little
arc tube of it here but I always do
black in my waterline so I definitely
want to change it up today and I'm just
gonna smudge drag I'm actually gonna
take that and put it under the wing just
the hair okay so we got the red down now
I want to dip into you and saw me a
little bit like I feel like I got a
swatches with my finger so you guys
could really see it at first oh my god
it's like a brown green metallic heaven
I'm like I'm just gonna put some right
little ear just like an someone got my
bottom even more okay okay
over the Burgundy the red I'm like itchy
ones now I'm just taking a brush with no
product and just kind of merging
everything together so it was like a
flawless blend alright now it's time for
lashes I have been obsessed with these
the Vegas nay lashes you can give use
the Ulta I'm obsessed
they called brand glamour and hype you
see those they're big so let's start off
by coating our lashes with the Too Faced
better than sex mascara and you guys
know how it go how to do it
let's coat our entire bottom and top
lashes so they are ready for the falsies
all right now these lashes are so
luscious it's almost like two lashes
together I
um hooked on these ones and I'm just
gonna use my duo glue you know I love
this smell oh so fresh wave and below
just how you goodbye sign goodbye with
life let's slap these on I'm just gonna
put these in like the middle of my eye
and move them around to my liking
alright the lash is are done they are
bold like these I'm feeling these now
it's time guys time for a semi light all
right so I'm gonna go with champagne pop
and pearl from that Jacqueline Hale
Becca cosmetics collab and I'm gonna be
using the Seurat Beauty highlighting
brush if you have never heard of Seurat
before it's expensive but the brushes
are just like oh I don't have to explain
it I wish I could reach through your
phone or computer and let you feel this
because oh girl so as usual I'm going to
dip into champagne pop and pearl just
kind of you know let them have a moment
together and then voila I don't know why
I never gets old up in on I light I'm
like this is just so now I did I did a
little light on my contour today I'm
purpose since I wanna you know try out
something new I've been doing my contour
the same for so long I've been kind of
changing up in my videos as you guys
have seen so this is today's
experimentation now I'm gonna put on a
lot of highlight I mean what's new now
this brush you just got to glide it once
and it's like oh I just like to go back
and forth because I love the feeling of
the brush like I need rehab for real and
then you guys know the drill
Cupid's bow always don't fuck with me
you know I let my Cupid's bow and then
for this look I'm gonna leave my nose
alone and just let its have its own
moment today so we're just gonna really
focus on cheeks Cupid's bow and then I
like to take champagne pop by itself and
just kind of do a little bit up here a
little highlight above the brow if you
will all right and then last but not
least let's put some lifts on alright
for lips today we're actually going to
do two products and I'm just kind of
feeling a little 90s Pamela Anderson so
I'm going to take
ACK Spice liner and then we're going to
use the Tom Ford blush nude lipstick I
have always loved this one I just
haven't used in a while so let's fly
these lips
all right liner now we're going to take
some blush nude and I just pop my lips
together I just love that it's very
Baywatch very 90s now if you want to
define the line you can go back in with
your liner and kind of buff up so you
get that nice gradient all right lips
are done now you know I cannot leave
this room without some setting spray so
let's set this mug all right guys this
look is complete so now that this look
is complete I'm obsessed with it I I
love it I'm like damn like I I wasn't
sure how that liner was gonna pan out
because it's kind of very toned but I
love it so maybe I'm gonna stop doing
black liner for a minute and start
experimenting with more stuff I hope you
guys enjoyed this look so if you love it
give it a thumbs up or if it made you
throw up you can skip to the next one
