channel
now today you see this mouth girls I
have been out all day and I came home
and I'm like you know what I want to do
a swatch video on a new product I just
got the mail and then I took off my
lipstick that I'm wearing it was like
this bright red and it left a stain on
my mouth I was like should I still to
the video I put foundation all over my
mouth I covered it I will exfoliate with
a lip scrub and I think it's pretty good
I don't think it's going to change the
outcome of me doing a first impressions
or trying something out so we're just
gonna dive right into it now today I'm
going to be doing a first impressions on
the new Marc Jacob Beauty liquid
lipsticks they're called de la Marck
liquid lip cream so this is Marc Jacobs
a version of a liquid lipstick of course
you know by now that every brand on
earth has a liquid lipstick and of
course there are different formulas
finishes smells there are so many
different kinds now I'm like oh my god
first of all I am a huge a Marc Jacobs
fan in general I think he is a merging
designer and when his beauty line
launched I was like wow quick little
information about these guys they come
in a unicorn that looks like this
similar to all their packaging it's all
that standard black and white very
iconic for them I love it it's very like
I don't know it's like business
executive glamour it's cute now
this has a zero point one one eight
fluid ounces in here which is 3.5 ml for
all you people that like to compare
brands now these is really weird because
I logged in to Sephora the other day and
VIP Rouge had early access to these and
I went back on the website and they
vanished so I think that they are not
online yet until they launched now this
says a little disclaimer that they are
formulated with Brazilian butter and
collagen so a lot of the times we'll see
brands put shea butter in their stuff to
keep it moisturizing but this one says
that this is a luxurious liquid formula
that glides onto the lips so that they
stay looking plump and full all day long
that's a bold statement so we're
obviously going to put these to the test
see if they're amazing
so they come in six shades they are a
range of bold nudes and a delicate
vanilla scent oh so they're vanilla
scented they're already telling me and
each stroke of the velvety doe foot
applicator delivers unexpected full nude
coverage with a subtle satin Sheen oh my
god that's a mouthful all right so I
bought all six shades and of course I
will
thank God this branded the names are not
crazy and I can actually put on some
haul today so I'm gonna be swatching all
six of these guys and um let's dive into
it now I do want to make a note that you
can see the colors at the end of the
component that gives you like a little
window which is cute it's like a little
circle and you can see what color you're
about to try which I love because at
first I was like oh my god they're all
black like the packaging how am I going
to find the color but hi it's right in
front of my face so I am going to be
trying out truth or bear okay I see I'm
gonna be trying that one first and first
of all let me open it see even what they
look like ooh fresh baby ooh I love how
the wand is really long I hate really
short applicators kind of more hard to
get in there and very vanilla um smells
like a yummy candle but not too strong
you all know sometimes a strong one
that's like it hits you in the face and
you're like booj booj booj booj but uh
these ones are very subtle which I love
so I'm just gonna this was just pulled
fresh out there with just a little bit
on the dough foot so I am going to try
that and if I have to dip in twice then
I will so um let's give it a whirl
all right so all righty I'm like oh wow
they are really full-coverage which
thank God because who likes a
astray key lipstick and nobody all right
so I've dipped in one more time so that
first one coated my entire bottom lip
now let's try this out hmm I really love
the color I'm like gold I mean you guys
know nude lipsticks we all love them so
I think I want to give this a minute to
kind of dry down now it does not fully
dry down to a full matte kiss proof
liquid lip which is totally fine I just
want to put that out there in case you
guys are like oh my god because remember
there's been other brands I've tried
before and they made that disclaimer and
it never happened
so this one is supposed to be full
coverage but still have that kind of
satin moment so I'm just going to
quickly I don't know what am I gonna do
take a hit like a big I don't know but
I'm gonna go downstairs for just like
five minutes and see if there is any
change but she cute all right just came
back from being downstairs that
literally was gone for like three
minutes just want to see if there was
any more drying or how it was gonna look
now I have no complaints that might
shock you all yes the shady bitch has no
tea to spill so far they feel really
lightweight like I think that's the part
that's tripping me out like lips don't
stick together
it feels very it does feel hydrating
does feel moisturizing I feel like it's
doing everything that it said it was
going to do thank God because a lot of
brands girl and looking close-up it's
full coverage it is full pigment and of
course it covered that little horrible
red stain that was on my mouth and when
you touch it comes off a lot came off my
finger
but like none came off on my lip damn
okay let's go into the next shade this
next shade it looks to be like a soft
nude Brown it is called a fawn over me
let's give her a whirl woo
I feel like this lip looks so pretty
with my eyeshadow I'm like hi here
alright so this one has the same
consistency same formula the reason why
I say that is because a lot of brands
will have like a few colors and they're
like unreal amazing and then some of the
shades you're like what happened so so
far this mmm I'm looking I said but mmm
this color is so pretty I'm like oh my
god hi nudes
I just love new to lipsticks okay so we
have a four more to go let's do some
more the next shade is called hot cocoa
it looks to be a darker shade of brown
my Christmas tree actually just got
delivered while we were filming these
videos so I am all giddy I'm in the
holiday spirit baby alright
let's swatch hmmm alright this is hot
cocoa hmm I like this one a lot I know
my eyeshadows neutral so I try to like
what I do swatches you guys I want my
eyes to try to look as neutral as
possible so you can all see what the
colors are gonna look like mmm my teeth
um this one's really cute it's giving me
like 90s porn vibes I'm living all right
let's move on to the next one the next
shade is called shush balázs that's a
tongue twister it looks to be like a
warm rose terracotta type of color she
looks a little something like this
and let's put her on the mouth
I don't know what color is my favorite
so far but this one is gorgeous I think
this one would look good on literally
anybody not that the other ones didn't
but I'm like really gravitated towards
this so we got two more
let's give them a go all right the next
shirt is a soft nude looks like this on
here now this shade is called yours to
try that's alright let's give her
a go
okay I think I definitely lied because
the last shade it was it was amazing but
this one it's almost like a beige
creamsicle if they like mesh had sex
this would be the outcome and oh my god
you guys I'm like actually living for
this one I think I'm being way too
positive in you guys gonna lead ooh I
really love them all okay one thing I do
want to say is that I noticed that the
nudes I needed like one more dunk into
the product to get the full coverage now
it's a full coverage lipstick but it's
like the other ones that were a little
darker or more pinkish had like maybe
they a little thicker like nothing too
crazy
obviously it's fully pigmented and it
worked great but that's like the only
thing I've noticed thus far but smell
formula they're all really consistent so
we have one more to try let's slap R on
this next shade is called slow burn I
love all these names they're cute all
right six shade my mouth is like girl
give me a book in it all right that's
wrong you know that moment when you over
draw and there's no turning back
that's what just happen to me
all right this is the final shade I love
that warm like rosy toned color alright
now that I've tried all six let's give
my final thoughts so after trying out
all of them I'm actually really not
actually like I didn't expect to hate
them or anything I'm really pleasantly
surprised with the formula now every
brand has hit or misses this one is
definitely an A+ jeffree star approved
formula I love the full coverage I love
how they feel mmm it literally feels
like there is nothing on my lips which I
love I don't want to have to deal with
it or touch up later so I am a huge fan
of E I'm excited to put them in a few
tutorials and see how they wear
throughout the day but if there are any
other crazy lip products or anything new
that you guys are like girl why haven't
tried it yet just let me know in the
comments down below and real quick
before I leave I'm gonna give a little
shout out to my wig master webster wigs
