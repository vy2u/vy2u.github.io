channel today we are doing my march holy
grails and fails now so everywhere you
flew by you guys I know I did not do a
February favorites or I need to have a
video like that I don't even know what
happened February it just vanished it
went by in a flash I just remember
blinking and all of a sudden it's about
to be April and I'm like I can't I can't
breathe so in today's video we're going
to talk about some of my favorite makeup
product some of my favorite fashion
items and I'm also going to talk about a
few products that I tried last month
that mm didn't really work out for me
besides that you guys recently some life
changes have been happening with me and
Nathan we hired a personal trainer oh my
god mom I was trying to get a little bit
more fit I kind of slacked off on
working out half of last year and I just
miss the feeling of working out and
having real energy throughout the day
and not always needing energy drinks or
that type of so I'm back on my
health kick and I just feel mentally and
better as a person a lot more even if
happier with life I think that Fitness
is so important I think I want to make a
separate video about weight issues and
insecurities let me know if you guys
want that because when I did the video
where Nicole covered all of my tattoos
there was so many people just being like
really evil and crazy about like oh my
god you look too skinny you look through
this you look to that and I'm like
really but we're still like really going
in on people too hard and now personally
I'm really happy with myself and how I
look of course how others view me is how
others view me but I think it really
brings up a different topic of self
worth individuality weight issues
whether you are overweight or
underweight and just how society judges
us so I definitely kind of want to just
sit and turn the camera on over the next
few days and maybe just kind of talk
about stuff so if you guys would be
interested in that type of video let me
know down below so recently like
literally a few days ago I just got back
from Necker Island which is owned by
Richard Branson oh my god I'm sure you
guys saw their snapchat was lit from so
many different youtubers and beauty
influencers I
what was Benefit Cosmetics and I got to
take Nathan we filmed an entire vlog for
my channel so that will be up hopefully
in the next week or two and it was just
really fun everyone was there
Manny Nikita Gabriel Pasteur egg Niki
like literally everyone was there on a
tiny little island in the middle of
nowhere it was a wild but um so if you
want to see all of our adventures that
will be on my channel soon and besides
that you guys a few days ago me and
Nathan just had our two year anniversary
holy I feel like we literally just
met and I don't know I'm kind of having
this reminiscent just a moment of the
first time me and Nathan ever locked
eyes and we met I just felt like he was
like an old friend and I literally I
don't know I like my my heart and my
body my whole entire soul was just like
so like comfortable and he's probably
one of the only people in my entire life
that has genuinely loved me entirely for
just me and two years have gone by in a
flash it was really cool to celebrate
our anniversary on the island as well
also we are literally one week away from
the many MUA jeffree star cosmetics
collaboration it is around the corner I
am so excited for you guys to see
everything and just touch it steal it
play with it if you guys haven't seen
the reveal yet and you've been busy you
can check it out on many's channel of
course I'm going to link that down below
but um yeah
the first makeup items I'm going to be
talking about today is no other than in
the anasazi at Beverly Hills Nicole
Guerrero co-locate now I did a review on
this about a moment a month ago and you
guys really loved the review it was
really fun to see everyone just excited
about highlighting you guys know I am
highlighting God and I just I don't know
I love basing highlight now this palette
alone let me just it speaks to my soul
now I got to be really real with you
guys nothing new here kitty kat might be
hitting pants soon because i've been
using her a lot recently I love layering
this with my ice cold or with any other
highlighter I just wear to god it's like
like amplified to the extreme and this
one though I've been using forever lit
on the brow bone in the inner corner it
is one of my favorites I think that this
palette is William
I know that so many of you have been
loving it so I definitely had to put
this number one I love it this palette
now let's move on to something a little
more glossy now this is on my lips right
now BAM this is from a Chanel now their
lip glosses have been probably one of my
favorite formulas just throughout the
last few years because it is very
lightweight and is not sticky it's
almost like a wet type of feeling that
just kind of goes away is really no
crazy fragrance on this one now this is
like a beautiful golden glittery type of
clear gloss and this shade is called a
melted honey
I love that name now I am wearing this
over nothing these are just my bare lips
no liner no lipstick but this over a
lipstick though or like a light liner is
everything I know I don't really talk
about glosses a lot I am a matte queen
but this one though is just fabulous
alright the next item is from the brand
of our Sally and this is their makeup
primer serum it is amazing I don't know
what it is this like this is like a
magic in a bottle when you put it on and
put it on rub it in all over your face
wait a second put your foundation on and
it is so soon a it on for like mmm like
seven eight hours and my skin looks
amazing now I love this brand I can't
wait to see what they put out next let
me know if anyone has tried this down
below not much to say about it except it
is amazing as a primer and that's why I
use it for I think I'm alone next up is
from any brand iconic London and these
are the illuminator drops now they are
blinding now the other day I literally
wore moisturizer and just lipgloss and I
mix this with the moisturizer and it
just gave my face it's all over like Q
of like metal I was feeling very akin
man very snatch and in case you guys
have never seen as an action I talked
about these in a video called Instagram
made me buy it which I will put down
here these are everything you guys let
me just demonstrate a little bit on my
hand hi there now a little goes a long
way so it's going to take to finger it
here and
I mean hi do we need to say anymore
anyone I mean this is just great for by
itself in a moisturizer in your
foundation you can drop it on your
cheeks and bust out with a Beauty
Blender it is very versatile and you
know what's crazy is literally the day
that I posted the video I talked about
how I wish they made other shades and
they literally put out two shades that
same day coincidence yes God so there
also is a few more shape and hopefully
they expand the next item is BAM this is
a blush called a bumpy ride from the
brand NARS now I've been wearing NARS
since high school oh my god I just got
highlighter all over that this blush is
really really gorgeous it is very soft
and peachy which I know everyone has
been into those colors lately including
myself and I love a denim moment with
some peach blush I mean it is everything
now these blushes are a little bit on
the pricey side so of course there are
other dupes for you know this brand but
I feel like if you can get the real
thing and get the real thing
because this formula is a balm it blends
and melts into the skin it's not chalky
probably one of my favorite blush
formulas ever and not the interview are
shocked a little product placement here
but my androgyny palette has to be in my
favorites it has been out for almost two
months now and the response has been so
incredible I love seeing everyone's a
look if you're on Instagram hashtag
jeffree star cosmetics I can see all
your looks I love reposting everyone but
my poly guys I'm going to open her up
because she is worn and I love seeing
pans that are really worn in now this
one I've been using for contouring my
face and this for a highlighter I don't
know what it is you guys but greens I'm
wearing military right here in the
crease I've just been loving greens
lately definitely different from what I
normally do but this palette just means
something is so special to me as the
second palette that I've ever created
and just to see you guys love it so much
is just so unreal so thank you guys so
much and I might have another eyeshadow
palette lunching in the fall we'll see
all right now let's dive into some
fashion items now sunglasses if you've
been watching my channel for a while you
know that I always put sunglasses in my
favorite
I'm obsessed with them not also for
Italy list but for anti-aging whenever
I'm driving in the car I always have
sunglasses on all those over at someone
and when the sun's hitting their face or
it's bright out I always see people
squinting and on the cup some crow's
feet girl not today
so recently a Gucci just put out some
new sunglasses first of all the case
though that teal velvet I'm like hmm I
love kind of messed my eyeshadow -
mm-hmm now these glasses I've been
wearing a lot lately let me just put
these on for y'all for a minute please
why are they so cute
if you're not in stupid glasses and you
think you look ridiculous you can
fast-forward to the next item but for
someone that appreciates huge glasses I
live for these the zorroski crystal
border is kind of everything let's be
real
I just love obnoxious fashion I think
they're so fun and maybe these might not
be for everybody but definitely they
maybe they were made for me no but I
just love outrageous things and they're
really fun and giving me a lot of 60s
vibes and I don't know it's anything
pink though you guys know if it's pink
I'm gonna buy it so Nathan's here real
quickly because we have something that
we've been using for a few months and
everyone's like what the our iPhone
7 plus cases we put kind of all over the
internet you know they're pretty tight
and we're obsessed with them they are
from a Louboutin we have three of them
here today whoo of course Nathan got the
dude version he has a black and gray the
annihilator and as they call it yes and
I got the reverse monogram I use that
for a lot of March and then I recently
just got this gold crocodile and I
 live for it it is so heavy
yeah acknowledging them yeah you can use
this as a weapon probably I'm in there
we Campbell something to come from me
this is a brick yeah whenever anyone
sees it they're like oh my god can I see
that and then I like throw it and then
you remember it's like this thing is
like it's huge it's quite big it's like
my face you can't even see anymore
exactly it's like but it's heavy yes
eyeko literally it took our wrist a few
days to get used to it yeah like
being able to grip it you know and when
you're in bed laying on the pillow and
you're up oh my god you have to double
hanoar you're like if it drops on your
face Mama's gonna need some extra big
concealer for the day all right
but um yeah I love these of course a lot
of people ask we believe a ton of girl
the only place that I believe Adan is we
leave a dime so if you want these um I
know that they're floating around they
sold out so quickly so I know that
they're really hard to find and also
really pricey for a dumb cellphone case
so I know a lot of people are like you
mean that give me anything in
life except food and water right but um
maybe some love but I'm obsessed with
these and hopefully they put out more
soon yeah my last fashion item no shoes
backpacks you guys know that handbag or
but backpacks has it speaking to my soul
lately I don't know why I when I'm
traveling I'm loving just storing things
on my back instead of carrying a heavy
ass purse all the time so recently
Chanel just put out this beautiful
classic backpack now I just love Chanel
when I was a little girl I always
dreamed of carrying Chanel bags I would
watch Sex in the City and you like this
little pink pot I want one and now that
I'm a handbag collector I am obsessed
with these type of items they are like
pieces of art to me I don't take these
for em it is what it is like to me this
like speaks to me and they're just like
I know I just love collecting I'm
definitely collector but this backpack
is perfect for traveling from the go for
all those long flights of mom would be
taking a lot recently and I'm obsessed
MA all right guys now we are going to
talk about a few items that kind of
sailed for me last month and every
product that I mentioned throughout this
year that is a sale I will always
explain why and why it didn't work out
for me
if you had a great experience with this
product congratulations you definitely
saved money by not a you know not a
reducing engine but all right so the
first product I am going to be talking
about today is the kind of a cosmetic
Skyliners now you guys know I mean look
at my face
I am a blinding highlighter lover when I
tested these out of my channel there was
such crazy feedback and opinions a lot
of you were like look
is just not stunning it looks cheap the
highlighter was not blinding for $22 and
I totally understood all those concerns
I had these same issues now this one is
a strawberry shortcake I love the pink
hue to this but it just really wasn't
blinding for me and then of course the
banana split one which was talked about
a lot in my channel it was cute they're
just not blinding and I think for $22
there is definitely a lot of other
products out there that work a lot
better but if you're someone that likes
a subtle glow these will probably work
for you but for me it was a sale all
right now my second and last fail Oh
Lord Jesus this is the Too Faced
chocolate chip palette I'm going to use
the word palette loosely because this
thing is so tiny now when I saw this
online I got the illusion that maybe it
was like bigger like their chocolate bar
palette or maybe slightly larger I'm not
sure what I expected but when I got this
from the mail I was like it's like when
you finally hook up with the hot guy
even wanting for a long time and you got
a zip his pans and it's like that all
that's kind of the moment I have with
this product so let me
open her up now look when I saw that you
guys I immediately was like am i doing
the full face using only kids makeup
challenge because this looks tiny look
how small those bands are and here's the
main problem let me get a brush and let
me just tap so let me just tap into the
shade right here once or twice there is
so much fallout it's unreal every shade
you guys is literally just like oh my
god can you feel it my lighting let me
just click it a few more times oh it is
in 10th the one good thing about it is
it smells really yummy like most of
their products now they all smell bomb
as but the actual formula and the
product itself I'm not really loving and
it's like you can definitely create a
full look out of here is just a lot of
light it's like these two all kind of
looks like the same shade to me and they
threw in the classic white and the black
but yeah it's so really sad for me and
the fallout I'm like I literally taste
the like the powder in my mouth right
now which kind of yummy but maybe
dangerous
besides that you
those were my only disappointment for
last month there was a lot of amazing
things I also tried out a lot of stuff
and if I don't use something more than
once I really don't talk about it again
unless like if I reviewed and I hate it
it's going in the makeup archives and
one day I'll just make a tour
I rise all right you guys thank you so
much for watching my March holy grails
and failed I am really excited to dive
into April I'm so excited for my collab
with Manny to come out and we're about
to start off spring strong and then
summer wait till you see that limited
edition jeffree star cosmetics packaging
there is a huge bundle coming out oh
thank you guys so much for watching me I
will see you on the next video mom ow
