channel now I'm finally doing monthly
favorite videos I asked all of you guys
on Twitter if I should start doing them
you know corporate makeup skincare
purses and that type of stuff and
everyone is like hmm
so I'm finally gonna start doing some
favorite videos so the month of May went
by I feel like in a flash like first of
all I can't believe like the years half
over I thought we were just starting to
celebrate New Year's and yeah fresh
start now I'm like oh my god where the
hell like has time gone it's crazy I've
had so many launches from my own
cosmetic brand life is moving too so
quickly me and Nathan hit our one year
and five months at a bursary it's like
life is just hectic so if I want to slow
it down for a minute take a breather and
tell you guys all of my favorite things
from the month of May so let's get
started now I gotta say this tatcha dewy
skin mist is everything I know you guys
have all seen me use it in a lot of my
videos I go between setting sprays like
all the time sometimes I like the fix
plus sometimes I like the urban decay
but after discovering talk to skin care
I was like oh okay okay now this one is
very hydrating the ingredients are very
expensive it's all made in Japan and I'm
just such a fan of this brand now
everyone is making fun of me for
spraying half the bottle in a few videos
ago girl you would do the same damn
thing because it's a must this gives
your skin such glowy luminosity
afterwards I was just like oh my god I'm
gonna douse the whole bottle on my head
now the one thing that I do wish could
happen is that I could unscrew this and
literally just douse it and have it rain
down my head um you know so we'll have
to get in touch with them and see if it
could help me out but you guys this
spray I'm like I'm even gonna just spray
it on my face right now this is just
everything ah it just smells amazing it
feels like heaven
I am such a big fan of this so my final
thoughts on this guy I am obsessed with
you all right now let's get to
highlighting we live in a highlighting
obsessed world and I couldn't be happier
so when I discovered this sleek makeup
compact I about fainted because I will
buy anyone's highlighter from drugstore
to chanel I don't give that H we wore if
you guys had a highlighter I'm buying it
I saw this on Jacqueline's snapchat and
she's watched you on her cheeks and I
was like ah it was blinding literally it
was like a satellite had just bounced
off her cheekbones and hit Calabasas
because damn yeah I was like so I
googled this brand and they are from UK
and I gotta say something I bet it's
just heavenly like I'm just gonna swipe
this is my favorite one that's just a
little one to swipe it is so pigmented
it's like a mirror is on your cheeks and
then this lavender one it's just oh it's
so pretty now it also has a yellow one
which I know nikkietutorials loves to
use this one is really light and then it
has a cream shade at the top which is
fun because you can do the cream first
and then put the highlight on top it's a
religious experience I promise you that
so I know that you guys can find this
online just Google so leak and get to
blinding time for little shameless plug
because my skin frost highlighting
powders debuted in May and I couldn't
believe how astronomical my first launch
was I was just like oh my god so my
favorite shade from my line is ice cold
it is that just blinding white gold
platinum highlighter we're just going to
do Skippy little just give you guys a
little swipe right there it is
full of pigment I'm just going to do a
little swatch on my hand here oh I mean
it is reflecting off of my entire
existence right now these retail for $29
and they will be back in stock or really
soon the demand is
been so real like so real I'm like damn
I really need to fire up the machines
and make a billion more because y'all
cleaned me out
so if you've tried my highlighters thank
you so much for supporting me and if you
are waiting for them you can always
check my snapchat in my Twitter which
will be linked down below that has the
quickest updates for what the hell is
going on in my life in my brand okay the
next thing because we're gonna stay in
the little makeup room right now is
something that I really don't wear on
camera a lot but a lot of the time can
you guys see me on snapchat and I just
have sunglasses on and no makeup out I
kind of have a little glossy lip I love
using Revlon glosses I know you guys are
like drugstore don't lie to us I swear
on my life this gloss is everything this
shade is called sky pink and I really
love it because it's very light but it
still has that kind of like I'm just
gonna swatch it on my tattoo right now
it still has a little luminosity and
color to it so it's not exactly clear on
the lips it just kind of gives your
natural lip color a little boost of
confidence and energy and I'm a huge fan
so you know when I don't want to go out
with a full face mask on like whether
I'm going to you know Cheesecake Factory
or McDonald's I just throw in some gloss
so these can be found at the drugstore
they were very affordable and very
sickening now let's dive into some
skincare now right off the bat I gotta
say Burt's Bees makeup wipes these are
facial cleansing towelettes it's a
makeup wipe these are so hydrating they
are 99% natural I don't know what that
one for some that is a natural you know
whatever yeah whatever but um these are
they're just amazing like I don't use
these to take off my entire face I think
I'll do a whole video on that but you
know I have to swatch eyeshadows and
lipsticks all day long from my lab and
we're testing stuff all the time these
just get stuff off really easy now this
is the cucumber and sage flavor they
also have pink grapefruit and they smell
divine especially if you want to get off
highlighters liquid lips they're really
gentle and they don't really hurt you
which is nice some wipes I'm like hi my
mouth is gonna send you the medical bill
because it's so these are really good to
get off stuff and
they're really hydrating so it's like hi
my tattoo even looks a darker and
fresher after that which is nice so I
know you're like okay what can be so
special about a makeup wipe I just love
how these feel they're really gentle and
nice so I'm sure there are a million
other makeup wipes that you guys love
but this is my personal favorite i buy
them religiously at the drugstore and if
you guys love these tell me below or if
you haven't tried them just give it a
whirl I know you guys have seen me use
this guy on snapchat a lot for the last
few months this is by Sicily and this is
called the Black Rose cream mask as a
mouthful huh now this is a mask that you
put on when you have no makeup on and
your skin is fresh and clean and you
actually leave this on so it's like a
topical and you just put it on entirely
it's like a cream here I'll show you
guys a tiny little bit right here it is
a Corinne mask this one is literally
like up to you guys look it's like hi
there's none left please stop I mean
Nathan use this all the time there we go
so it comes in the cream form and you
just want to like coat your entire face
with this and then say you know go play
a video game go smoke a bowl and in like
ten minutes your face is like sucking in
all this moisture it's crazy now
depending on your skin type if you're
dry you are gonna love this and if you
have normal skin amazing oily I don't
have any friends that are oily that have
tried this so I cannot contest if you
have oily skin do not say I said it was
amazing for that but normal to dry this
is a godsend now this item is a little
on the pricey side it retails around
$100 but you get a lot me and native use
this probably like 10 times and it's
finally empty so I definitely need to
get a new one
it basically smoothes out your skin
almost kinda like plumps it up and it
just gives it a little just a little
breather of life remember not to give
yourself expectations or be let down if
something is not like a miracle worker
now the last thing I want to say about
skincare is I get asked all the time how
the hell do you take off your makeup
that we're gonna do it for a whole
nother video but once the makeup is off
I love to tone my skin moisturize all
that jazz
I'm talking about my favorite toner this
one is by Dior this is the lotion tender
I don't even know how to pronounce that
so we're just gonna not even try it at
this is the gentle toning lotion and
this has a velvet peony extract now this
one is almost empty as you can see from
the bottle now I love this because you
get 6.7 ounces which is a lot for skin
care and this is like a tower if you
want to see my hold up to my face it's
like whoa this is a big bottle so she's
running low I use this every morning at
night now this is not the only toner I
use I have a whole crazy regimen which
we'll get into that later but um this is
my favorite I found this on Sephora
because I'm such a Dior makeup lover I
was like you know what I'm gonna try
some other skincare I've been using one
of their moisturizers for about like two
years now and then I'm like into what
I'm gonna try more their products so
this is a must-have hey babe Hey so one
of my favorites well I know you guys are
like is Nathan you're here hey favorites
he's my favorite every month we're gonna
talk about our favorite thing to smoke
now medical marijuana is very big in
California if you are not a marijuana
user anything marijuana sucks just fast
forward to the next thing but ah this
you guys listen Jack Herer is our
favorite strain for the month of May it
is so good we've been buying a lot of it
now this is like finely milled little
pieces it smells so good our whole
studio just smells like wheat now yeah
it smells great in here now the reason
why I love this is because it is a
sativa strain so what that means is that
it keeps you awake and bright throughout
the day and also takes away your anxiety
and any anxiousness you might feel and
I'm just obsessed so I think we're gonna
fire up the vaporizer and now the
vaporizer for the month of May this is
my favorite thing to smoke out of I know
we smoke out of pipes and bongs all the
time on camera but this handheld the
vaporizer we found this online how much
was like 300 bucks right it's amazing
because you put the weight inside here
so we're going to lift it up for you so
you basically take out this glass piece
and you put the marijuana in there
and in here and it basically cooks it
for you so what is it doing it's
basically just cooking all the little
crystals and we're basically excluding
the plant matter in it so you don't ruin
your lungs as much so basically you just
let this heat up and hit just six we
don't like to hit to seven because
you're kind of overcooking and it could
burn
yes I'll burn it and then that will
defeat the purpose right all right let's
wait for it to get cooking Oh sounds
like cooked popcorn it's so good so you
basically just suck on this can we get
remember this is vapor this is not smoke
so light but like it's amazing
excuse my lipgloss all right come on
vaporizer if you guys smoke weenie don't
vaporized what's that H you guys the
best way we're down to the last few
items now I'm going to jump into some
accessories because when I wear stuff on
Instagram or snapchat I get asked all
the time what the hell is that so I
think my most requested like tweet and
comment of May was these glasses now I
wore these in my Birkin bag video and I
wear these a lot on snapchat
oh I'm obsessed oh I think I got some
tacho spray on them but it's okay Chanel
doesn't mind now these are from the
runway collection these are called the
Chanel shield glasses and they come in
four colors when I saw this like weird
gold red tint I was like but Seth so
these are from Chanel I know they still
have them on their website and in stores
because when I was in New York a few
weeks ago I saw them there and on the
website I know they sell quickly so if
you want them get them before they're
gone because Chanel once they make them
they make them once and then they're
like you had a chance and bite now I
know a lot of you are not into
sunglasses that are like luxury items so
it's all good you don't have to like
them but I love them now the
last thing is also from Chanel I think
in the month of May I use this for about
probably three weeks out of the month
and this is the canary yellow boy bag
now I saw this at the Chanel store in
New York when me and Manny were there
for the Urban Decay event and I was like
oh girl I had to have this color I
collect bags probably for about ten
years now I have been collecting purses
and I'm just such a Chanel lover when I
was little I would read through my mom's
cosmopolitan magazines and I would see
ads for Chanel we were just a normal
little lower-class family from
lannington Beach and my mom did not have
these in our closet
she went to Ross and so did eyes oh when
I would look at these ads that would be
like oh one day so now I collect bags
I'm obsessed with Chanel and I know a
lot of my girls out there in the makeup
world
I love Chanel I mean how could you not
it's just so pretty I think besides that
the month of May is officially over and
done with I hope you guys enjoy this
