skincare I really didn't update my
skincare routine or change it or really

be diving into strictly strictly dickly
no strictly makeup and some fashion
items I know I didn't do an April
favorites video where like where is the
time going you guys the year is half
over we're about to be in like we're
about to be in summer I cannot believe
June is like around the corner it's here
I can't breathe I'm just like what the
 but the good thing about June is
that my summer collection the chrome
jeffree star cosmetics full collection
will be launching around the end of June
I feel like I suck another day and I
feel like I should just tell you guys

so June 24th of the summer collection
will be launching on my website and of
course all of my retailers will have it
as well I will be doing a swatch reveal
of everything next week I know you guys
are watching and you're waiting for it
and you're like besides that you guys
April and May have been so insane my
collaboration with many MUA exceeded our
expectations and it just exploded and
it's sold way quicker than we thought
so I just want to say personally thank
you so much for all the support on that
collaboration I know a lot of you are
asking us to please bring back the
Eclipse highlighter and the daddy
lipstick if you do not know I'm shook
liquid lip is still on my site there are
some left but the other two items are
gone so maybe y'all should tweet Manny
and say Brooke also I was just in San
Tropez which is the south of France and
I went with the brands away which I'm
going to talk about them later in the
video but I had such an amazing time on
that brand trip so I got to bond with
other amazing Beauty influencers and it
was such an incredible trip you guys I
think that traveling is just so
fulfilling so a lot of you have been
asking me to do more videos with Nate
and those are definitely coming we have
a lot of cool stuff in the works but if
you guys have any video ideas or
anything you want to see me and Nathan
tweet me or sound off below and I know a
lot of you have been wondering
zach is going to be returning on my
channel sadly he moved back to Michigan
California did not really work out and
me and Nate you guys no tea no shade
though I just love living alone I mean
for dogs is amazing those are our babies
but there's nothing like living alone
and it's having sex whenever the
you want on a couch on the floor on a
kitchen but anyway yeah but good news is
you guys me and Nate have been traveling
a lot and we've been visiting his
hometown of Grand Rapids Michigan and I
don't know I might want a house there
we'll see what happens
everyone in Michigan watch out bitch the
Geoffrey Charles coming all right you
guys if you want to see my may holy
grails
and fails then keep on watching but it's
not you will next one all right you guys
let's dive into some makeup I'm a little
shook to the ground at myself because I
am obsessed with the Maybelline Dream
liquid mousse foundation now listen for
a foundation to be $8.99 and drugstore I
am like shocked at how sickening this
formula was I know so many of you wanted
me to try the it fit me
Maybelline Foundation which I have and I
did buy it Alta but this one spoke to me
and I have been wearing this in like
five videos y'all will never know
because it looks so snatched but you
should know because this foundation is
so incredible I don't know what it is it
just looks so airbrush and pretty but
not matte and dry it's like very like I
don't know doll like and just stunning
and I'm obsessed with it I have been
using shades 10 and 20 now for the last
three weeks and I'm hooked this one it
definitely number 20 is like my exact
shade and I'm such a fan of this so
shout out to Maybelline girl work
alright you guys so Marc Jacobs Beauty
has this new highlighter that came out
about a month ago it is infused with
coconut and I'm just going to show you
because I can run my mouth all day but
until you see this in action so
basically this is a liquid of course
obviously you can see that it is for the
body space you can put in your
foundation but just look at this finish
that is literal pure metal now imagine
it on your neck on your body on your I'm
just going on my neck anyway like are
you kidding me it's just so stunning in
the Sun
light I mean I put a lot on my hand
because I'm a sick bitch and I love the
bling but if you just subtly do this or
rub it on your legs for a photo shoot or
you're just on the beach and you want
everyone to stare at you like look at
that oh it's just so stunning and it
smells so good so this one is the this
one is called do you question mark so
these are coconut gel highlighter drops
and these are limited edition I think so
if you're watching anyone from Marc
Jacobs duty please make them permanent
all right now listen for the month of
May I use this a lot now the brand
Natasha Genoa which is pretty bomb I
will say that I've been using it for a
while now for like two years and I'm
obsessed with the formulas now I know
Natasha is finally among sephora.com and
in some stores which is so amazing girl
I'm so proud of you congratulations her
eyeshadows are unreal the formula the
pigmentation are just on point so once
you put out a new palette you know mama
had to have it so this is the sunset
palette and now besides the astronomical
price point now I'm just going to keep
it with you guys this palette is a
hundred and twenty nine dollars I know
let me let you all roll your eyes right
now let me give you a second you guys
done okay so after you get past the
price point I swear to God I don't know
what it is the formulas are just amazing
you see I've been really going in on
these colors a lot when Manny did my
makeup for his channel he used his
palette I've been using this a lot I
didn't know brow like a few weeks ago
and you all were like where's the
tutorial so I think I will definitely
have to do one I just love this brand I
think it's really cool and the colors
though I mean hi all right you guys now
let's talk about some blinding
highlighters I'm sure some of you were
like bitch what the hell is on this
cheek it is from the brand's away and if
they have these amazing powder
highlighters and girl let me just tell
you something about this company I love
indie brands that create amazing
formulas and have really cool packaging
I've met the owner Christina about I
think a year ago and we've just really
bonded and our love of makeup has
brought us really close so I am about to
before I even show you these
highlighters I am well yeah let me show
you the highlighter but I do have
something to say for the first time ever
I don't want anyone to fall off their
damn seat but for the first time ever I
have asked a brand if I could have a
code for all of you guys because I
really believe in this brand I love them
and they are a smaller brand you know
they're not in Sephora and Ulta they're
definitely like me where they are
you know they do have some retail but
they are very online driven and they are
a really cool company so after trying
all their products for a while I saw
that mani and a few other people had
codes and I was like you know what I
know I am never about the code life I
really don't ever want you guys to think
oh my god Jeffrey's doing this for money
or he's doing codes to get more money
like on the realest to you guys my brand
has blessed me so much and the reason
why I don't do codes it's because I
don't need to make the money and I know
that I don't want that to come off as
pretentious or sounding in any type of
way and regardless of anything I say
people are going to articulate it in
their own tone and their turn their own
way but I don't do codes because I
wanted to always keep it really honest
and I always wanted you guys to you know
but you know what Jeffery is the one
bitch that isn't getting paid to say
this is cool or this is great so I think
the only way to achieve doing a code was
one simple route so I asked is your way
if I could donate all the money that I'm
making from a code to a charity and they
were like oh my god are you for real
that would be amazing so I am NOT going
to keep any of the money I want to
donate 100% to a charity that I believe
in and in Los Angeles there is the LGBT
community center basically this Center
in Los Angeles I have visited it I am I
used to live around the corner from it
it is the world's largest provider of
programs and services for the LGBT
community and they help people from all
around America and I just think it's
such a cool place that I've even visited
myself I used to live around the corner
from the center a long time ago when I
first moved to LA and it's just
something that I'm really passionate
about so if you want to try the brand of
course I am giving you this offer to use
my code and it will of course be going
to a good cause and I will be filming
going there soon and I can't wait to
surprise them so if you use the code you
do get 15% off and they just released
this new line called the skinny dip
collection if you guys saw me on the
trip on snapchat in San Tropez about a
week ago you saw my cheekbones look into
something like this
and this is one of their highlighters it
is called the skinny dip as you see
Mama's been going heavy in the pan now
this formula let me just take a clean
finger here like you see that Oh itch
I'm just going to put this on my hand so
you guys can really see what's going on
hi so if you risk someone that loves a
blinding metallic glow you're going to
love this let me do a few more swatches
this is shade citrine girl first of all
there's that second of all there's that
oh they're so pretty I'm like obsessed
with the formula I mean look at the way
that glows you guys I am obsessed all
right last but not least is from one of
my favorite brands Benefit Cosmetics now
they recently put this cheek parade
palette out about like a month and a
half ago oh my god I have been using it
ever since and let me just show you what
it looks like so of course it has its
classic hoola bronzer here and now there
is a new shade B hoola like I love
mixing me all over forehead cheeks jaw
nose tank feet whatever you want to put
a baby recently they also put out this
new blush called California I mean as
the California native I love the names
and it is just such a beautiful like
rosy peachy type of tone I love it I'm
wearing it a little bit right here and
dandelion why have I been putting this
in my crease and kind of living for it
and as someone that travels a lot I love
bringing this because you have bronzer
than blush in one and you don't have to
have a bunch of compacts around so I'm
into the travel things I used to not be
into this type of like packaging and now
it's convenient bitch
alright let's dive into some fashion now
oh my god girl first of all sunglasses
every time that I wear big sunglasses on
snapchat I get so many people
screenshotting it and tweeting me what
brand what brand or bandit is oh my god
so the top two I'm going to pick them
today they are one is from Chanel these
are the matrix glasses let me just put
them on for you and basically as you see
as you move your head they look like the
intro to the movie matrix where all the
green numbers are falling down and oh my
god I love them they're huge and
obviously if you don't have a horse face
like me and no eyebrows you may not like
them but I love big glasses I love big
anything
really second pair of glasses that I got
such a like high number of requests of
like what the hell were they were these
beautiful huge silver chrome aviators
and this is from the brand of Versace
oh my god I love these now sometimes I
like glasses that have an opening
because you can see the highlight so
when you're doing selfies or pictures
your glow Willy gets to have its moment
what these tickle is covered so you're
going to sacrifice the glow or I don't
know but I am obsessed with these ones I
think I've been wearing them for three
weeks straight and they also come in red
and black so I might need those and now
it's time to talk about the elephant in
the room so this is the
Chanel boomerang which here's what's
crazy about life now look some may call
me controversial some may call me I
don't know what people call me well I do
but I've heard it all so I really lost
track the other day I bought this from
Chanel on Rodeo shut out the Gabby I
love you girl first of all it's a
boomerang okay in my head as an American
citizen I have seen in boomerangs since
I was a child and they have been used
for leisure activities from dawn till
dusk girl so when I bought this I did
not think anything of it I snapped it I
was throwing it around in my back yard
I even chipped it let's just zoom in a
rat there look at those chips girl mmm
that's what happens when you throw the
boomerang and lands on your roof which
was kind of hilarious but hey suck it
now I bought this because I love Chanel
I am a fashion whore and I just love
anything fun or unique so I also bought
Chanel tennis racquets
tennis balls paddle balls but of course
the boomerang just turned into a circus
now I am really sorry if anyone was
offended by this at the end of the day I
bought this with my own money because I
thought it was cool and me and Nate
loved to do outdoor activities what I
didn't expect was for TMZ to follow me
at the airport asking about it
cnn.com emailing me asking for a quote
of what I think about this and how it's
a culture appropriation and I'm sitting
there like oh my god I literally woke up
the next morning to literal hell you
guys and here's like I had no idea it
was going to be this big of it's like
anything
even a big deal anything at all I really
thought cool I'm just showing something
Q on Instagram I know a lot of you were
like girl that's from an indigenous
Australian culture that has a whole
thing for hundreds of years and I did a
lot of googling and I'm like okay now
the price point was a little crazy yes
did I spend $1300 on a piece of wood
yeah but that's my own money that I
worked for so who the cares what I
buy here's what I don't like is that
after doing some deep research because I
am NOT a boomerang educator or you know
that in tune with the subject
walmart.com has been selling bloomerang
for twenty years for ten dollars how
come no one cared boomerangs have been
sold at towards arrest for years
boomerangs are for sale at Target
everywhere every store in America they
are literal like theirs they're common
things here in America but I think
because it's me because it involves me
it's always going to be a circus and
people always want to try to drag and
make this into like a thing we always
call it like the thing in my house like
oh here we go girl so I'm sorry if I
offended anyone that was obviously not
my intention I'm sorry if anyone took it
like that but I think that there are
other horrible things going on on this
planet and in this world that I think
people worrying about a piece of wood is
just really sad there are so many you
know horrible tragedies happening every
day and so many horrible things in the
news you know I think that we live in
such dark times there's always something
so horrendous on the news I'm like girl
like literally me buying a piece of wood
should not be on TMZ but hey people love
entertainment and they just love trying
to with me so great you had your
fun moving on next
all right you guys last but not least
I'm going talk about another Chanel
product because they're one of my
favorite brands and just some little
news drama is not going to deter me from
shopping so Chanel is one of the first
luxury high fashion brands to make an
LED purse what the does that even
mean maybe you thought on my snapchat
which if you don't follow me it's linked
down below but Chanel recently put out
these gorgeous boy bags and they are LED
activated I'm going to slowly dim the
lights for you guys you can see this
bitch in action oh my god it is so
amazing what technology can do nowadays
it
so cool I am such a fashion lover when I
first saw these I was like oh now you
open a bag like this and it has a switch
inside where you can change the patterns
of the LED so let me change one for you
guys oh my god you look so sickening
alright so I change the pattern and I'm
going to turn off all the lights you
guys can see this in action oh yes so
basically it does like a million things
it changes different colors and when we
just open it and I will switch it again
I mean come on you guys the other day I
was in the club and I turned this on
people were gagging and by the way I go
to the club about once a year now
look how cool this is it's like raining
down I don't suppose like I'm not like a
Vegas like a nightclub or like an EDM
show I think this might be one of my
favorite ones like all the little C's
bouncing around alright let's talk about
a few things that didn't really work out
for me over the last few months oh my
god girl now listen y'all though
Christian Louboutin is one of my
favorite shoe designers on earth I'm
beating a dead horse by by saying that I
have a closet full of red bottoms but
when it comes to makeup you guys it is
very on the Misses for me it is missus
oh my god no thank you
now this mascara $70 underwhelming
nothing special and I'm not just being
like shady I'm not trying to sound rude
it's just the facts and I think people
are a little afraid of honesty nowadays
but listen I don't care who watches this
video at the end of the day this for $70
no ma'am and the second item that
definitely flopped for me oh my god
Jevon she beauty girl now the foundation
that they put out recently was very
pretty it was very on the more like
light coverage side so I've only used it
a few times since reviewing it but this
beauty sponge it looks amazing when I
saw it online I was like ooh it looks
dangerous like I need you wet it expands
but for some reason it did not
distribute the powder and the foundation
correctly it was very streaky on camera
you could really tell and sometimes
beauty lights are a little more
forgiving girl
there was nothing forgiving about this
except my skin and I just it just was
not a hit for me I was really
disappointed I love the shape of it but
it just did not work
for me all right you guys those were my
Holy Grails
and sales for the month of May I am
ready to dive into summer I'm sure all
of you are so I will see you guys as
very soon in my next video so watch out
for that summer collection everything
will be revealed soon all right you guys
I will see you on the next one mwah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
