be ending April 4th all right bitch
let's jump in to this review this is a
fish early called the maybelline
superstay full coverage 24 hour
foundation now I am someone that doesn't
really like to wear a foundation for 24
hours but there some of y'all that work
late you sleep on your makeup you wake
up and you just literally rub your eyes
and you're back ready to roll so this
may be good for you my skin will not
allow that but I bought three shades
today we have shade one zero to 110 and
112 now one eye you know how it is you
guys are in the drugstore you're trying
to shade match yourself or attempting to
and you know it's not gonna work so I
bought these shades and I think this is
oh my god bitch this is way too light
this one now that we're in the light way
too yellow so I think that 112 actually
is going to work and maybe we'll do a
drop of 102 and mix these two so today
on the right side of my face I am gonna
be applying it with this damp Beauty
Blender and then on the other side I
will apply the foundation with and our
teeth brush so we will see which one
works hey are you gonna disappoint me
today so let's pull up the factsheet on
the foundation and let's see what the
fuck is supposed to do we are on the
Maybelline website and this allegedly is
a concentrated full coverage foundation
that's gonna leave a flawless finish
that doesn't fade or shift all day all
right that's a big claim now a lot of
people have said this is better than
George or Armani it could be a Dupree
hood of beauty and I'm like
okay let's see now the benefit it says
saturated color pigments provide an
ultra transforming effect in this
long-lasting formula the lightweight yet
high-impact coverage formula glides
under the skin for a flawless makeup
finish that lasts all day oil-free
doesn't clog pores derma logically
tested okay we're gonna see about that
today
all right it says apply to the face
maybelline I know that well I might
apply this to my taint if it's you know
apply to the face and blend with your
fingertip sponge or Maybelline blender
alright baby we're just gonna let's get
going we're gonna shake this up I might
do a drop of this light one hair back
don't try me let's just go right here
oh girl that was a lot okay let's drop
oh but this one was 102 now before we
even mix this on our face I am gonna say
that this foundation is one fluid ounce
which is a very standard most
foundations come in a fluid ounce bottle
for a drugstore already I'm like damn
that looks thick and kind of sickening
so comparing to the lemare you guys I
mean both glass bottles ones a hundred
and ones 1099 I'm like goddamn so this
foundation does retail for 1099 there is
sixteen shades and there's a lot of
reviews all over the internet so many
people are having different experiences
but what jeffree star gonna experience
let's find out so I am going to quickly
before I apply this I am going to put on
some primer at the new Tasha silk canvas
primer god I'm obsessed I can't stop
using it so yes we are gonna be bougie
today we're gonna use this primer now I
like to just take some like that rub it
between my fingers and baby our pores
are gonna be so natch
all right primer is on now let's take
this I'm gonna take actually the end of
it and just mix in those colors
oh girl you can't even see my tattoo so
we already know this is about to be
something different okay so we're just
gonna take this I don't know how much to
apply
I don't know how full coverage this is
so let's just dam a little one a long
way honey okay now I know we're gonna
put a brush over here I'm just kind of
dabbing it for fun let's take this and
let's bounce
oh she's full girl just better be so
full coverage where it covers up my
anxiety and my motherfucking pores oh my
god my other side of my face looks a
little spooky now wow my your net my ear
needs some that's my first impression
okay let's do a little close-up I'm
gonna put my hair back for a second here
is the right side of my face blend it
out with the Beauty Blender and this is
how this side is looking and of course I
know I dotted a few dots around but look
at the difference you guys it's like you
can see my discoloration you can see
freckles you can see some redness and
then you go over here and it's like hi
all right now we are going to take a
little bit more I mean girl a little in
a long way we're gonna do the exact same
amount again um I'm just mix this up
with the brush right here Oh BAM all
right now we're gonna take the oval-8
brush from artis I mean this brush
covers it very quickly so let's see what
holy shit oh Lord
now if you've never used in our teeth
brush before you guys they put the
product on very fast
I mean if you are someone that like is
on the go all the time and you just want
to slather on foundation quickly I
always recommend this brush because look
at that already done and done alright
you guys so here is the side with the
artiste brush blend it out and then here
is the of course Beauty Blender now let
me grab a mirror and let's really see up
close and personal we're also gonna zoom
in a little bit let's see how the hell
my pores look my skin and everything
first impressions which side do I like
better let me try to put this mirror
down here and really look huh no
normally I can tell you guys right away
a really big difference but hmm now if
you've watched a lot of foundation
reviews on this channel you know usually
I'm into the Beauty Blender side somehow
it's just more softer beautiful and
pretty it just applies it really great
here can we stop but then we're gonna go
over here to the artiste side and I'm
like are chase and I'm like I keep
patting my face because I can't help it
just I'm like Oh more give me more give
me give me more give me more
I am kind of indecisive I almost like
how the artists brush side looks and
that is a very unique and different for
me to say that so I'm like wow aren't
you
now of course it could be whatever is in
the formula alright you guys so this is
definitely a medium to full I could
probably add more and even do more full
coverage but I'm pretty happy with how
this is looking and I'm like huh okay so
I definitely want to finish the rest of
my face and do a few more things but so
far I'm like when something's hyped up
on the internet I'm over here rolling my
eyes like uh-huh
cute but first some reason you guys were
not playing me said please review this
Maybelline foundation I'm like
pleasantly surprised so far so let's add
some concealer on camera and see how
that will look now the only thing is
Maybelline if you're watching this baby
I really thought there was a lighter
shade and I bought at the drugstore this
thinking it was this but lighter no same
shade so if you were someone that wears
110 fair in there
age rewind it's still a little too dark
for me so please can we get the one zero
one maybe all right now we are going to
pull out the makeup revolution conceal
and define which are used in a video a
few weeks ago really loved it and was
pleasantly surprised at this as well so
let's see what happens
mmm okay we're gonna conceal our fucking
lives right now let's just do one side
and see what happens with the foundation
of course we are gonna take our Beauty
Blender look I could do more concealer
no we're okay now I like to take the end
of it and really go in the corner and
also take some and just put it on my
lids so it's like a primer for the
eyeshadow and then I'll flip it and use
the bigger side of course to cover a
bigger area on this horse face of mine
first of all this side blend it out so
pretty I'm feeling 12 again I'm like oh
my god hi this is the first time I've
ever putting on makeup just feeling so
youthful and just so kind okay the fact
that I am wearing a drugstore foundation
and a drugstore concealer this is $6.99
by the way Haller and I'm actually
living for it I'm shocked in a good way
and the best way possible
all right we're buffing this chin out
mm-hmm thank you chin no do we need to
do an artiste brush on this side just to
be even-steven over here or what
now obviously the sponge is gonna soak
up some of the product this one will
really not because of the bristles and
the way that it's designed so we will
seeing oh wow yeah this bitch is fucking
oh all right so it's safe to say that
these two together they work and they
work really well I'm pleasantly
surprised again and how nice this is
looking together now of course our teeth
brush side does look a little more full
coverage than this blended out but we
already know why now we definitely need
to set the face before we move on and
I'm going to take this Beauty bakery
full hour a setting powder today I've
been living for this and I really love
how it applies now I do love to apply
you and you guys already know with a
damp Beauty sponge so we're gonna open
up with the sifter put some on here and
fake
oh girl I don't know how to cook in the
kitchen but a bitch knows how to bake
all right I'm gonna go swallow and be
back in five
all right now we are going to dust this
off mmm-hmm
keep that concealer looking really cute
no I love this because it just sets that
concealer so nice like they did that
with this formula now you guys know I
love a brightening powder as well but
with all this combined we don't want to
look dry or cakey so we are going to
stop here and I am going to finish off
the rest of my face but we are going to
be doing check ins today and we're gonna
see if this foundation actually lasts do
a long day of love and fornication all
right you guys how are we looking what
do you guys think
sound-up although even before the video
is over because I want to know what you
guys think right away is this sickening
up close we are going to punch and even
closer so you guys can really see the T
I think at this stage in the game this
is my skin now I'm just a human baby
take it or leave it but um yeah you guys
wow I don't see anything to complain
about I'm kind of surprised because you
know this bitch has some shit to say so
far so good so I'm gonna do a little
contour mascara and I and I will be
vlogging and checking in later alright
you guys so it's been a 45 minutes only
since I put this on but I want to do
check-ins every few hours so you guys
can see the real T so we're in direct
sunlight right now and okay
only thing I'm noticing is a little
crack alright in there but that's where
I've been smiling non-stop today so I'm
not that surprised I didn't do a heavy
setting powder there so okay oh my god
under eyes are looking good we're
looking youthful foundation yeah it's
actually looking really good so far no
oiliness I do have a brush hair right
there in my eye
hello thank you bye
see that right there you go with the
thug let's take a little closer look oh
my god she's looking good so far
but will it look good in a few hours
we'll find out Nathan just surprised me
and I want to show you a little bit of
our house too so come take a peek at our
anniversary so this is what I woke up to
this morning
never seen this many roses before I'm
like I might leave this here forever so
since we are doing a foundation Raviv
Nate has seen me try out a million
things in the last three years now so
yeah
what are we feeling I mean thanks very
Matt it looks very I mean don't see me
many creases anywhere no that's good so
far it's gonna be like an hour right now
probably yeah so far so good you know
but we'll see what happens later we show
one three four bye
I'll write you guys so it is let's look
on the clock almost 6 p.m. now I've had
the foundation on for hours me and Nate
just had a cute amazing magical
anniversary dinner on the beach for a
few hours and it's still bright out
daylight savings time I'm not mad about
it but let's check in right now and see
how the foundation is wearing let me
grab a mirror right here now more most
importantly this little girl look at
that I did eat but this is the
Maybelline Super oh god I don't even
know the name it's awful the super ink
the liquid lip that lasts a long time
this is in shade poet and I love it but
eating all that food girl most
importantly the foundation now let's
look here Wow okay I'm like pleasantly
surprised
only thing I'm noticing and I would have
touched this up if I was not testing the
foundation you guys know when I'm
reviewing something I don't like to
touch up but it is Sunnah yeah yeah it's
kind of severely cracking just right in
here but I've also been smiling
ear-to-ear all day not that that is an
excuse but I do want to know that I've
been a little bit more happy than usual
um just in general today has just been
so cool and I was just like like I'm
just Dumbo all day right now so besides
that under-eye looks really good around
my nose there's really no breakage
except a little right around here which
is normal I think it's been about eight
hours but it said 24 so I don't know you
guys what's the T what do you guys think
besides that I think the forehead looks
very smooth face looks good just a
little cracking there and a little bit
here but this is normal for me always I
always touch-up right here I'm surprised
it's not really coagulating it's not
breaking up apart it's doing the job so
far so I guess we'll see what it looks
like in a few hours so we are upstairs I
turn on some of the beauty lights oh it
is getting late I'm like vampire okay so
Foundation how are we doing
let's take a peek right now you guys and
ooh my nose is looking rough okay
overall though
a little rough I did wear sunglasses
earlier maybe I bought myself I have
five dogs who knows but it did wear a
little bit right here oh my mascara look
at this overall forehead is actually
looking a really good we'd have this
foundation on for hours now ooh bitch I
look a little rough right now I'm tired
it's been a long amazing day babe yeah
yeah you guys it's actually holding up
pretty well for how long it's been
I'm like it's not really cracking on my
face it's a little here like we said
earlier a little here a little there but
not bad what do you think looks good
I just want a problem or highlight is
that bad I'm like no sarcophagus Hey BAM

our final check-in now I'm looking in
the mirror whoa okay Maybelline you may
hunt like you maybe that's the magic on
your hands

long time and it looks really good for
the wear and tear of the day I am very
shocked at how long it's lasted and I'm
