channel today I have a pimple and I
don't know if I want to live anymore
alright so let's address the elephant in
the room for the first time on my
channel maybe the second time ever I
have a pimple yes sometimes I am a human
being I tried three foundations this
past weekend and my skin said bitch what
the hell let's not do that ever again so
today we are going to be testing out
some brushes inspired by the movie Mean
Girls
y'all know I've been a huge Mean Girls
fan since at the beginning that is one
of my favorite movies I used to sell
hats for my clothing line a few years
ago and it said of the plastics but I
also have a Regina George highlighter
from my brand so when I saw these
brushes were coming out I was like whoa
Lord Jesus I order them immediately and
I think there are actually out of stock
now we're gonna hop on the website in a
second and check but we're going to test
those out today so if you want to see if
these crazy brushes at work they keep on
watching so this brand is called a
spectrum when I saw this float around on
trend mood on Instagram shout-out to you
hey girl and on the internet I was like
I have never heard of this brand this is
so crazy
and at first I was like is this real
because I'm like why would Mean Girls
license out their brand to Indy brand
not that's a bad thing I think it's
really cool that they got the license
but I pictured like a Mac or someone
crazy doing a Mean Girls collab but here
we are with this indie brand so as you
see we have the little emblem on here we
have the detailing and this is like V
burn book we all know we've seen the
movie if you haven't seen the movie you
might want to pause this video go watch
it and then come back and talk to me so
when you buy the brush set there are
several options this brand is giving you
on their website right you can buy the
burn book by itself which is of course
then a just a brush holder you can buy
the brush holder with all the brushes
inside of it and that retails for a 94
99 so that is what I bought today it's a
little pricey but then you are getting a
full wou leather case with a strap by
the way I do want to mention that this
does have a strap with kiss marks on the
back if you just want to buy the book by
itself or the brush is so low without
this that is both 64 and 99 so I think
right now the brush
that with the brushes and the case
they're they're sold out right now you
guys but I'm sure they're gonna restock
because this is a hot item let's open
her up
and let's see what the hell you get here
is the brushes I'm gonna hold them up
like this so they hold its easel there's
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten look at me counting on camera
all right so you get ten brushes I'm
actually take this out this is a
removable pouch I don't really like
pouches in my stuff I don't mind just
the brushes so here is what you get now
of course these are synthetic brushes on
the website it says that it is the
highest quality synthetic which of
course we're gonna try a few of these
brushes out on the face today I can't
wait to put on foundation let's go on
the website and see what exactly you're
supposed to get in this kit all right so
I'm gonna take some of these brushes out
I'm gonna assume what a lot of these are
so I'm assuming this is a foundation
brush of course to apply foundation each
brush does have a quote on it this one
says she doesn't even go here so if
you've seen that movie of course you all
know the famous quotes are very cute and
very kitschy now just from looking on
Spectrum's website they obviously make
other brushes which I didn't know that
so I think some of the brushes or the
styles that they already sell are going
to come in this so they're all numbered
of course okay we got a fan brush you
can do contour with this you can do a
highlight I mean you can really go in on
this one now the brushes do feel soft
they feel a little plastic II of course
synthetic is going to feel that way
since it is not real hair but it doesn't
feel bad like when I fill this it isn't
like you know some of the drugstore
brands y'all have felt some synthetic
shit and you're like oh this one feels
soft but a little plasticky not you not
too bad it feels nice I'm just gonna
pull out all of them where does this one
say you can walk home bitches oh so I
sat here you guys and I'm like overall I
don't know why I feel like the brushes
are giving me a little bit of a Lisa
Frank vibe maybe it's the purple when I
think of Mean Girls I think of like
everything pink black white I don't
really think of purple so it's I think
it's a cute idea I thought to myself
okay what can you really do with Mean
Girls with brushes I mean there's not
that much to do so I'm not mad at these
I'm just not like obsessed with them
they look a little like more childlike
instead of like I don't know I just wish
they looked a little more bitchy a
little more princess a little more Kunti
no see like that no purple huh
I love others look we're moving on all
right so I think I need some foundation
on my skin you guys so I'm going to go
in with some of my favorite no poor
bloom primer from touch and soul so I'm
just gonna put this on my skin and let's
see what happens all right now we're
gonna go in with one of my favorite
foundations the new YSL all ours I have
been using this for a few months now and
this might be in my favorites coming up
because a bitch is hooked so I like to
mix two shades sometimes brands just
don't make your exact facial color
that's sometimes a lot of the times I'm
gonna go in with a be 20 and then we're
gonna go and be 40 and do a little
mixing now a lot of the times you guys
all just go like this I like the high
pimple and by pimple huh
what if it just doesn't cover you guys
it's like oh let's take this brush of
course this is a foundation brush this
is the B is 0-1 and let's see how this
handle is my skin
first impressions while we blend it
definitely like let's the product
distribute thickly which I love because
I am a full coverage Queen so so far so
good let me buff out this forehead so I
don't look crazy anymore
sometimes a product will get eaten into
the brush or it will blend a little
weird you never know a synthetic quality
of what you're gonna get but so far I'm
actually pleasantly surprised because
this is putting it on really nicely so
I'm just going to buff this in and we
will see how I look alright so let's
take a little zoom in look this brush
applied the foundation it very nicely
now twice L it's a full coverage type of
liquid so yeah the foundation that's
were really really nice okay so we're
gonna move on now and let's try out I
had a lot of brushes here cuz I
definitely want to try to do some
concealer there's not really a concealer
brush here it's so oh okay well we do
have this so okay we're gonna take a
little bit of some Tarte shape tape for
a second let's put some on here alright
now I'm just gonna use the same
foundation brush and we're gonna see if
this works for concealer now obviously
you guys this is not a concealer brush
but I know a lot of people who just use
the same brush for foundation now you
guys know I love a good beauty blender
so I normally do not do this but look at
her buffing out all pretty what's uh
now to set the concealer we are going to
use this brush right here this is the a
21 brush so we're gonna go into the
little Laura Mercier powder I'm just
gonna go directly in and put some of
this all over now you guys see it is on
the brush
let's go directly under the eye
something that I've also been doing
lately is after I've set the concealer
or whatever I want to do instead with my
face I go in with the venti Beauty this
is the Universal Bellotti powder a girl
this makes your skin look like blurry I
don't know why or what is in this but
I'm obsessed with this so after I set
the skin I'll go in with this powder and
then I'll put it right on top just for
like an extra little like hmm alright
now we're gonna take this crazy fan
brush which a lot of people use for
contour you can you can use it for a lot
of things highlighting foundation so
we're gonna go in with some bronzer here
and a little bit of contouring we're
gonna go in with the KK beauty kit and
let's open her up now I like to mix and
match so I will go in like this and I'll
just kind of go back and forth
okay now that has a lot of product on
there so we're gonna knock a little bit
of it off and let's see if my cheekbones
want to carve out today oh my god let's
take off some of the product and let's
try buffing this out okay now they
weren't lying about these bristles
because this put it that was a little
shedding which is normal for synthetics
I'm not mad at that this product applies
really easy to the skin is it blending
good on camera yeah it actually ain't
too bad you guys I was a little scared I
put too much but now that this is buffed
out hmm
I'm liking it okay so let's be a little
more a light-handed for the other side
jesus take the wheel
now we're gonna take a little bit of
Chanel powder and kind of set the rest
of my face and go around the contour
make sure it's really soft and we are
going to go in with this guy va0 one and
let's see how it works now the contour
went on really nicely okay you can tell
this has some product on there and I
like to just kind of go around the
contour and make sure it is flawless
voila alright you guys so after oh wow
after looking at clothes right now I'm
like okay these brushes are actually
killing it and I'm shook alright let's
try the highlighting brushes well one of
them is definitely a highlighting brush
it is this guy right here I don't know
why it looks like it's crying right here
it kind of fell over but this is how it
looked when I opened the box so we're
gonna try out this little guy today and
we're also going to use this one you're
like really pretty so we are going to
use this one for a cream highlighter and
this one for a powder alright so first
we're gonna take this guy which you
could have used for contouring a really
sharp line as well but we are going to
use it for a little cream contour we're
gonna go in with the Stila heavens hue
highlighter and shade kitten it looks
something like this it is a putty
highlighter if you've never seen this
before I reviewed this on my channel a
few months ago so we're just going to
take this and we're just gonna go right
into this highlighter and let's see-oh
somes on there okay now this is a
blinding highlighter if we all remember
from the review she worked this is a
Jeffrey's or approved moment so let's
see how blinding we're gonna get today
we'll do some all over the brow since we
have no eyebrows today
this brush put this highlighter on
really pretty now we're going to go in
to the jeffree star cosmetics a Uranus
highlighter my collab of course with
mani MUA
she looks something like this yes she's
been swatched let's go in here and let's
see what happens
I don't really like fan brushes anymore
for highlighters but I swear to lower
Jesus this one is really cute not that
this is a bad thing but like y'all
spectrum really came through with these
brushes I did not know what to expect
there is a few brushes left I mean we
tried most of them on the reel we've
tried all of these now I think I can
obviously y'all know what I'm gonna say
you know I like these brushes already
now there are a few eye shadow brushes
and there is a lip brush course already
have lipstick on and I know a lot of
you're gonna be like what is it it is
the pink print lipstick which is the
clap from Nicki Minaj and Mac and of
course just put some uranus on top I
don't even know why I mean you touch
this up it stayed on throughout this
whole video already so we do have some
eye shadow brushes I could take a dip
real quick and see if they work but I'm
gonna assume and that they work so let's
pull out the androgyny palette and let's
just put in a little bit of safe word
and let's see what happens
BAM like all these like brushes really
blend out the product I am like a little
shocked at that there hasn't been one
that I'm like I mean it's alright it's
like you don't want to blend some
motherfucking eyeshadow here we are this
blended out really pretty so I mean I
don't even think we need to pause and
say what are my final thoughts y'all
know my final thoughts the spectrum mean
girl collaboration brushes are amazing
they blend it out like a dream and I
can't believe it y'all know I do beauty
blenders only for my foundation and this
brush really like it satisfies my needs
is it a little pricey yes but you do get
the whole kit and caboodle you get this
you can use this as a book bag or a
chain or to hide your weed in it I don't
know what the hell y'all want to do with
this but it's definitely cute and the
brushes worked like there's no other way
to say except they worked they were
great so if you want an entire set or
you're on the fence and you maybe want
some new brushes definitely check these
out I think 10 brushes plus the kit wood
that carries them all it's you know
you're you are you are gonna pay for
like kind of like a little collector's
item in the makeup world so I think this
is a cute idea the packaging was not my
favorite on earth but it's still pink so
anything pink I'm gonna buy alright you
guys I will definitely use these in
future videos and
um yeah bitch I'm like Dan about
highlight though what girl get your
sunglasses ain't going anywhere thank
you so much for watching another review
these brushes are Jeffrey's are approved
are you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
