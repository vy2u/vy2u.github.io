channel today I have no eyebrows and I'm
pregnant but on a real level we are
going to dive into something really
exciting today the drugstore brand
wet-and-wild has a brand new
limited-edition collection and today I'm
going to exclusively reveal the entire
collection for you guys and we are going
to do swatches we are going to do it a
little demo we're going to go over all
the prices now I just want to say a
quick shout out to all of you guys
because when I started my channel a year
and six months ago I had no idea it
would turn into this crazy like insane
thing already so a quick shout out to
everyone out there I just hit 5 million
subscribers mmm wow so thanks to you
guys for making it all possible it is
unreal and also thanks to you guys for
actually pushing me to try and use more
drugstore brands I know I am a very
intellectual but shockingly wet and wild
over the last year has like shook me to
the ground because they have come out
with really great formulas we all know
the highlighters that I have been
promoting for month you guys have made
them sold out in every drugstore across
America and it's just really cool to
discover brands that you guys have
recommended like Jeffrey stop being so
damn bougie and get into the drugstore
and I'm really happy that I have been
because some of the formulas girl that
wet-and-wild foundation the photo focus
like my wigs about to come off oh wait
this is my real hair but you all know
what I mean so today we are going to
unveil the midnight mermaid collection
of course it is for the fall and there's
a lot of cool stuff in there it's kind
of dark and glittery and dramatic so if
you want to see me and dive into the
crazy box and keep on watching
now of course rewind to a few months ago
wet and wild put out the first ever box
from their line which was the unicorn
collection and it did really really well
for the brand I heard and I think it's
really cool that this brand is doing
like the whole entire collection for a
discounted price I think it's kind of
cool because so many people are like
girl want the whole entire collection
and if you don't that's all good but
here is the midnight
a mermaid collection of course it has
this cute little mermaid on it the box
has scales on the side has the moon with
the ocean here's the little mermaid
scales
now of course unicorns and mermaids have
taken over the beauty world I think
unicorns are like girls we don't need
any more unicorns in this world but
mermaids are something that people are
starting to kind of become really
obsessed with as well and who wouldn't
want to I mean come on let's flashback
to my childhood
Ariel was everything and so it's Ursula
that pitchfork I still want it okay so
let's open up this box and see what is
in the collection whoo so as you guys
see there is a lot in here we have a
metallic liquid ice shadows we have
metallic liquid liner everything is very
metallic for the Fall and of course
there is a brand new highlighter listen
I am so excited to put this on my face
today and there's a lot of stuff in here
so I'm going to be doing a lot of hand
swatches I'm going to be doing some of
this stuff on my eyes we're going to do
a little demo if you will and we're
going to try out all four of the liquid
lips on my mouth I do want to give you a
some quick little tidbits about this
collection it is launching August 13th
and you can get everything individually
on all PSICOM I love that wet-and-wild
is now on also calm I'm praying that
they'll be in store soon Ulta if you're
watching this pay attention but I think
it's cool if you want to use your also
points or get some more you can buy the
entire collection there also if you want
the box and also you can buy the
individual stuff on August 14th on wet
and wild calm so if you want the bundle
you got to go on their website besides
that you guys we are going to dive into
all of this so let's start playing also
I want to announce something really
exciting that I have teamed up with wet
and wild and I am doing a giveaway of
the entire collection so I actually have
five of these boxes here at my house and
we are going to pick five lucky winners
to get the entire box so what do you got
to do of course let's start number one
you have to follow wet well beauty on
Instagram their handle is right here so
please follow them
you got to be subscribed to my channel
if you aren't already if you are why are
you watching me and not subscribing girl
get with it now I normally never say
that but when it comes to giveaways you
do got to be subscribed and besides that
if you want to leave a comment down
below say hi say what's up give me your
thoughts on this collection but you do
have to leave a comment and there's a
way to track if you're following us so I
think it's only fair that we do the
highlighter first I'm feeling a little
matte and a little bare and I don't like
it so let's talk about this is the Wet n
Wild mega glow highlighting a bar now
you see the little mermaid on the front
it is a really cute and now the name of
this one ie midnight moon of course I
was a little mermaid on the front which
i think is so cute I do also want to
know really quickly you guys that
literally everything in this entire
collection is vegan but one liquid
lipstick so literally over 90 percent of
the collection is the vegan and
cruelty-free there's just one shade and
I will mention it when i swatched them
that is cruelty free but the formula is
not vegan now wet and wild is I think
working on making their entire line of
vegan but until now there's one that's
Ravine you ain't using now we all know
what V mega glow highlighters usually
look like they look like something like
this I have reviewed them before I'm
obsessed they've been in favorites
videos not to toot their own horn but
they really killed it with this formula
now this one of course you see is more
rectangular let's open her up it opens
like this and we have a mermaid fishtail
with the scales on the imprint which I
love now this color I'm just going to
take my clean finger right here we're
just going to just watch her okay first
of all it feels really soft and creamy
now this color is like a wet pale Goldy
like white gold let's just do a little
swatch right here BAM oh wow that's
blinding okay of course I'm going to put
on my cheeks we're going to grab a
little highlighting brush if you will
alright so I'm going to turn the
flashlight on my iPhone you guys because
when you look up really closely there's
little fine pieces of like glitter
throughout the highlighter it's almost
like a baby pink lavender it's really
pretty hopefully you guys can see that
sparkle on camera
now let's try it on my face all right
now the factsheet about this one says
that it is fragrance free gluten free
this retails for $6.99 which is very
affordable formulated with nylon which
helps to promote bendability and have an
elegant silky texture it also features
micro-fine pearl pigments which combine
for a targeted multi color highlight
let's just see if the damn thing works
now I love wet and wild highlighters
because when you go in with a brush you
see like girl you got some damn payoff
about to happen that is really really
pretty and girl she's pigmented but like
on a real level you guys maybe I
shouldn't have gone so heavy-handed but
it's me we're talking about so I might
do 10 more layers but if you're someone
that does not love a severe glow you
really barely need to touch into that
pan there really was not a lot of
fallout it looks good on the skin though
oh my god I kind of lived for this color
now I am about to do lip swatches so I'm
not really going to go heavy on my
Cupid's bow but I will just do it over
here and yeah that is like blinding I'm
like oh good morning next product is the
metallic liquid I shadowed now I'm
normally not a fan or really use shadows
that are in tubes that you can paint on
I definitely have used some in the past
but I've been counting now I haven't
tried this formula yet so I am excited
to see it it comes with a four color now
it says on here that these are retail of
for $4.99
these are high-impact glitter shadows
that leave a shimmering multicolor shine
these also have pearl pigments to anchor
down the highly pigmented metallic color
keeping the shadow in place cruelty free
everything as well vegan great okay cool
so of course there is four shades and I
only have two eyes so we are going to do
some swatches on my hands now a lot of
the times with something like this that
is dark I love to have a dark base down
I normally would not go in with like
this black glitter and put it on my bare
lid
I love to have a base down so I did do a
smoky eye today of course here is no I
did a smoky eye so we're going to try
two colors on one lid here one lid there
and then I'll do some hand swatches of
course so let's get into it so I'm
really feeling this blue one first this
one is called aquatic prism it is really
pretty well in the bottle it is so let's
unscrew her not really smell so here's
what the DOE foot looks like excuse my
crazy backdrop it is a very flat which I
love which probably means it will be
easy to apply I mean let's just go in
and see what happens
oh okay so it's gonna act like almost
like a liner I didn't do lashes today so
you guys could actually see what the
hell I'm doing I'm looking in the
maunder and I'm impressed sorry I'm like
sitting her like okay drugstore how in
the hell are you doing this to me all
right the next shade is called moonlight
majesty and it is gorgeous
like almost magenta with like a green
reflex to it looks like get on my highs
bitch
I'm like really impressed with these now
of course you guys can see that this one
does not have a crazy glitter effect
like this one does it's still glittery
but it's a little more subdued obviously
this one has like really crazy like aqua
reflex I'm going to dip into here one
more time and just add in a little bit
more I think I wiped off too much from
the brush there we go now the base of
this one does seem to have a little bit
more like a darker pigment so it's not
as like blinding as the blue one but I
still like it pretty now of course I
would probably recommend to use a base
under these but I am going to swatch
them on my hands which of course I'm
going to have an O base down but
actually I'm going to show you if you
put a base on the hand and if you don't
I think that's only fair let's be
thorough shall we so I'm going to take a
little it's like a Mac Pro Longwear
Paint Pot normally I use the painterly
to prime my lid
today we're going to use this black and
we're just going to go in with my hand
so I'm going to take a little brush I
know I have so many tattoos but we're
just gonna use the back of my hand and
just pretend this is my lid and this is
weird we're schedule a little arts and
crafts moment here this is my eyelid
right now people alright so the other
colors are Laura's necklace and so we
have mysterious nights which is this
black one with gold glitter so here is
my base which would be like my eyelid
and I'll just swatch the black one real
quickly
this one looks something like this wow
look at that holy and then here is
a swatch on bare skin if you were to put
this on your lids it's still really big
mented like bitch they are not playing
okay girl is it a tiny bit streaky err I
mean barely that's pretty damn close
here is of course it's like a Jade
almost like very mermaid green called
Lara as a Lara Laura la RA Lara's Metis
and here is the shade with the base
there is that one I mean she green and
then let's dip in one more time and do a
swatch with their skin cool
here is a moonlight majesty which of
course is on this eye I'm just going to
do it on my bare skin so you could see
what it looks like it is still cute I
love that pink glitter in there so there
is that color and here's of course the
blue one aquatic prism and just put this
right in there sorry this is like kind
of awful the do hand swatches on the
back of your damn hand so sorry who does
not look the best but as you can see on
camera pretty good all right now let's
dive into the mega last metallic liquid
cat suit lipsticks the user let's hold
them up they look like this interesting
color selection for wet and wild I will
say this I was a little shook at the
metallic green and blue in here I was
like okay drugstore weird like a
venturing out I love it now these you
guys are supposed to be a weightless
metallic formula that glides on smoothly
and offers a full coverage pigment
providing vivid color with an ultra
matte finish now obviously these are
metallic so they're going to look a
little metallic also allegedly these
have vitamin E in it to improve the
appearance of texture and moisture also
you guys this is um cruelty-free
gluten-free everything is vegan except
this shade right here called Harbor a
crush so we might as well just watch
this first I mean yes I'm reading all
the info on my phone right here so I get
all correctly let's dive in
so here is Harbor a crush so watched all
right now let's try this crazy green
it's hard to tell my backdrop it is like
a emerald green and it is called siren
jewel
alright now let's dive into the next
trade it looks like a bronzy type of
metallic color and this one is called
coral crown so let's see what she looks
like
all right now I felt like what this
shade it might need a little bit of a
second layer obviously it is opaque but
it was a little streaky in some areas so
I'm just going to take a little bit more
and put it right on top this close
actually really wearable maybe a little
more than I thought I wasn't sure how it
looked in here but on here even with
this eye look I'm like okay girl alright
let's watch the fourth and final
metallic shade this one is called a sea
seduction and it is a deep metallic blue
let's see what this bad boy looks like
all right and here is the seduction
still watch I really love it now overall
all four did have the same consistent
formula very lightweight feels good not
weird this one for some reason I feel
like is even more opaque than all the
other one and it went on so good I mean
the other ones were great but this one I
think is my favorite obviously it's a
little weird not every was going to be
into the blues but I am digging it all
right you guys the final product in this
collection are the metallic liquid
aligners now my eyes are already like
smoke out to hell so I am just going to
take the metallic shades out of the box
there is three of them and it let's
learn about these liners they are vegan
they are going to take you from day to
night with this highly pigmented
eyeliner offered in rich metallic
finishes as deep as the ocean each shade
of course is going to have great shimmer
effects pearls high impact three long
lasting shades so these are supposed to
be long lasting I'll have to wear this
in a different video when my eyes do not
already look like an alien but I do want
to swatch them for you guys this green
one is called sea cemetry of course the
component looks something like this it
has the color at the top like it's been
dipped in metallic I love that finish so
you know what color you are grabbing if
you're in the dark or who knows what
you're doing okay so you can see the
brush is a very thin which I love for
creating wings and I was going to do
right here as normal and let's see what
this looks like
oh wow I was not expecting the liner to
like have that much payoff I go straight
away a lot of the times colored liners
are like streaky and at the end of the
day even though I do judge drugstore
brands are really hard because I expect
a lot you know and sometimes I'm let
down but I'm like oh okay the shooting
bad y'all I'm a little shocked this gray
shade is called
Trident shimmer and I've never actually
really seen like a grey metallic liner
let's just watch her next to this one
that's pretty cool for a gray liner I
guess we'll see how it drives in a
second but my bad and the third one is a
it looks like a deep blue and it's
called the C dream okay so as you can
tell this one is a little more on this
tricky side compared to the other two so
I'm just going to take this out and do a
second layer and let's just see what
happens okay so as you see layering it
right away what the second coat did make
it opaque so you will have to probably
go in twice with the blue one but the
other two look really stunning I'm not
really into dark blue liner but that
green though is probably my favorite
just because it really pops em and
stands out alright so I did wait five
minutes because these do claim to be
long lasting so I'm just going to take a
clean finger I got no make about my hand
let's just see what happens like I am so
lapping my hand huh nothing really came
off okay when awhile you better work all
right you guys now that we have
basically swatched and tried out the
entire collection
let's give my final dots now here's the
deal
434 and 99 that's a lot of makeup for
that price point I guess it is a 59 like
$60 value if you were to buy them all
individually so if you get the box you
definitely are going to save some coin
girl so let's go through it you guys I
think my favorite product from the whole
collection is the highlighter I am a
highlighter whore and I love how this
looks I keep looking in the monitor and
on my camera and I'm like oh my god girl
second has to be the blue metallic
liquid lip I think that was my favorite
shade also these are really great on the
eyes I think the blue and the green one
stood out the best to me
I'm oldest black when it's pretty dope
as well but I love how this is looking
like I want to do this on this eye now
it looks really really stunning if it's
gorgeous I'm a little taken aback at how
well this collection has works not that
I've ever really doubted wet and wild
well no I'm actually lying I have
of them in the past definitely years ago
I doubted them but they have come back
so strong and they're like doing some
high-end formulas for very affordable
price points which i think is awesome
because you guys always push me to try
more drugstore products so I hope you
guys enjoy this collection there really
wasn't any cons for me except that one
liquid lip was a little tricky and you
guys saw the blue liner here it needed a
second layer but overall the collection
its Jeffrey sour fruit yeah
the drugstore brand they are coming hard
and I cannot wait to see what happens
for the rest of the year but this
mermaid collection bitch it's on point
are you guys thank you for watching
another first impression swatch video I
will see you on the next one bye guys
