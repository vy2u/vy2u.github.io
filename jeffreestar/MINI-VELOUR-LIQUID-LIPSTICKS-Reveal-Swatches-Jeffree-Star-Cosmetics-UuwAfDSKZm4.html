channel yes today we are talking about
the velour liquid lipsticks and they're
many and they're from my brand and I'm
really really oh I'm freaking out I'm
really really I'm really really really
really right excited because today we
are going to be unveiling and showing
off the mini velour liquid lipsticks now
I showed a sneak peek on Instagram a few
weeks ago and the internet went nuts now
I have gotten to so many requests over
the last few years Geoffrey where is the
mini liquid lips and I always think
around holiday time like we are now
three years into my brand almost
November will be my three year
anniversary and I'm like it's time to
switch it up a little bit and let's give
everyone what they want if they're
asking for baby we don't give it to you
so today we are going to be talking
about this is a volume one of the nude
collections indie mini forms now I say
volume one because later I will put out
volume two maybe even volume three with
other shades but for now this is what
the bundle looks like it comes in a
beautiful this big y'all let me put this
over my face you guys see how big this
box is so it is large and in charge and
it says open here for nudes it is soft
matte touch so it feels really silky and
let's open her up shall we oh alright so
in the bundle you get eight shades you
guys and seven of them are my top
sellers that have been a staple in the
Jeffrey star family and the first one
right here is called skin tight and you
may recognize her she was a lip ammo
from the summer chrome collection which
was of course in a stick formula now we
have transformed it into a liquid
version and you will be able to try out
that formula
exclusively here so we do have that
shade and let's go down the line shall
we we got mannequin which is what I'm
actually wearing on my mouth today you
guys my favorite noona
ever made I think besides the next one
which is a celebrity skin and then we
have posh spice rose madder gem
leo and last but not least androgyny now
quick tea androgyny has been my number
one most bought in shade
second is unicorn blood third is
celebrity skin so y'all love the nudes
and the dark reds so of course I've had
to include androgyny in this bundle so
today we are going to go over how much
is in here how much is in each
individual item we're gonna talk about
the price we're gonna talk about
everything we're gonna do some swatches
so let's dive into it we bundle will be
retailing for $52 now a lot of you're
gonna ask about the prices now here's
the thing with minis it is a little less
than half of what you would normally get
in a velour liquid lip full-size now we
all know this retails for $18 this has
been the like staple in my brand and
this is what really catapulted the brand
to the next level is this formula so of
course the minis were inevitable so let
me compare at full size of course here
is shade leo and here is the mini so I'm
gonna hold it up so you guys can see the
sizes now I know a lot of you're gonna
buy a girl is there a lot of product in
there that was the number one most asked
question on the internet and let me
explain to you guys the fill weight so
this has zero point and nineteen fluid
ounces in there and now the mini has 0.7
it is a little bit less than half
let me explain I'm sure when you look at
it in my hand you're like girl is this
only it the product is actually I'm
gonna show you guys and I almost want to
break one apart but I'm gonna have to
get a hammer for that but when you open
this up okay you're gonna pull it out
this is a virgin one we've never been
used before
and of course you have the same wand you
still have the same base top as this one
so it will feel the same if you are used
to having a normal one and they go right
on the mouth now here is what I haven't
really explained before is that
underneath this pink plastic the product
is filled up almost to the very top of
this so there is the illusion of you're
only getting what you see in the clear
part but there's actually product that
goes almost all the way up I love these
because they're so good for just being
on the go you can take one or two and
throw them in your purse
a lot of times I like to bring three or
four colors with me so if you want to
throw them on your bad girl they're the
perfect size for traveling this
bundle will be for sale on jeffree star
cosmetics dot-com and few of my other
retailers will have them so if you guys
also ever want to know like hey does
your brand sell in my country or are
there any e retailers meaning like
Beauty lish calm or morphe brushes calm
that also carry my brand there are also
other countries that carry it so if you
go in jeffree star cosmetics dot-com go
on the top you guys and click the FAQ
section at the bottom it will show you
what websites actually carry my products
I know there's a lot of counterfeits out
there besides that this launches on
September 30th at 10 a.m. Pacific
Standard Time if you're watching this in
the future maybe it's out so you better
go cop 1 the last but not least we
should swatch all eight on my hand now I
have used these shades in a lot of
videos throughout the last year and a
half on my channel so you can find them
in tutorials but I thought if you've
never seen these colors or you want to
see them swatched again I will swatch
them on my hand you guys know I'm
infamous for the damn hand swatches
let's dive into it skin tight is a very
peachy nude it is a very pale now I've
been wearing the lip mo for a long time
and on my girl we need it in a liquid
lip so I'm gonna take these now you know
although this is not gonna be the best
swatches on the planet I'm not doing no
tape no nothing I'm just showing you
exactly what the color looks like so
there is skin tight now if you are
someone who have used my liquid lips
before there's no explanation needed but
if you are new my liquid lips are vegan
they are cruelty free
they are paraben and gluten free and
they are also very full coverage they're
very light on the mouth so it really
feels like you're not really wearing
much and of course they are long lasting
if you're gonna eat oily foods I
definitely recommend grabbing it and
taking it with you because oil will
remove most or if not all liquid lips
alright next shade is mannequin of
course I am wearing it on my mouth but
we're still gonna swapped her on my hand
real quick this is a darker shade than
skin-tight of course you're about to see
in a second BAM and there is I'm gonna
try to make it the same width because my
brain is like a little more there
we go alright so there is mannequin MA
next up is celebrity skin this is one of
the top selling shades of all time for
my brand right below and drogyny and
this looks good on every single skin
tone it is in the more dark family so
it's a little darker than mannequin as
you can see on my hand let me bring it
all the way back there we go
it is a shade darker so if mannequin is
too light for you it definitely go up
and do celebrity skin or use it with a
lip liner and put some in the middle
baby
mmm next up is posh spice which is like
a Grey's nude it has more of a grey tone
to it it's kind of a little more eat the
roll I love this color
let's swatch it I think when I first
came out with this I wore this for like
a month straight could not take it off I
just love the tone of this one as you
can see it is darker than the previous
three next up is a rose madder which you
all know I've used this shade in so many
videos I love it it has a different tone
it's not your typical nude but it's
definitely in the nude family oh girl I
am obsessed and I kind of feel weird
saying I'm obsessed with this color
because it is my own brand
but maybe I'm obsessed next up is Gemini
and I know this is so many people's
favorites like I see this tagged all the
time this is a more of a warm tone
almost like a peachy celebrity skin and
I think this shade looks flawless on
anyone alright now next up is Leo which
of course we just mentioned and this one
is such a beautiful warm terracotta nude
this looks so beautiful on medium to
dark skin tones and let's swatch her my
hands running out of room but you guys
will get the gist sorry for these
swatches I know they are a little weird
and unconventional but hey the hand
works so as you see it is a little
darker than these three and I just love
the undertone last but not least is
Enduro Janee this was one of my favorite
shades of all time
and it has been like number one ever
since I put it out it doesn't matter
what color I put out this is still top
seller it's insane so of course we are
going to swatch androgyny right here
this is such a cool dark plum Mavi type
of nude and you guys have made this such
a hit so thank you so much for
supporting androgyny so here all eight
of the minis swatched I know a lot of
you have these shades already and if you
don't this is a perfect time to grab
them and try them all so oh Allah here
they are thank you guys so much for
