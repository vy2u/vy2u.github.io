channel now today I am bringing you some
warm toned
sultry smoky eye drama I thought I'd
give something a little different than
what I normally do
meaning color wise now today I used a
new primer and a new foundation there
are so many makeup products coming out I
really can't keep up so I'm going to be
trying new things in every upcoming
video if you want to see my previous
face routine go back and look through my
channel and also I want to make a big
announcement right here because I get
asked every day about when I'm
restocking certain liquid lip shades
from my brand now February 12 you hear
that bitch February 12 I'll be
restocking androgyny masochist and
dominatrix so now that there is official
date write it down and don't be late
because if this sells out again like
last time oh my god I hope you guys
enjoy this look I had a lot of fun with
it and if you want to recreate it please
hash tag me on instagram snap me
facebook me you all know how to find me
alright enjoy guys alright let's get
started now I'm gonna break away from my
usual priming routine and Foundation and
try some new stuff now everyone has been
raving about the lemare the mist primer
I'm just going to take this and mist it
all over now for foundation I have seen
so many people using the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD Stix I know Nicki is a big
fan of them got our 2:30 and y22 5 so
I'm going to use the lighter one on the
middle of my face and the darker one on
the outside this is a full to medium
coverage foundation so let's see what
happens and then we'll take the darker
one will disturb you outside
of the face as always i'm going to be
taking my damp Beauty Blender and we're
just going to be tapping this in I'd
love to put some on the lid it's like my
pre primer for the eyes hit those ears
and then blend that color all the way
down to the neck now before I set it
with powder I'm going to try the Make Up
For Ever Ultra HD anti-crease concealer
got a really light shade this is y21 tap
some under my eye area I'm not a big fan
of concealer under the eye as I
personally don't need it but I love it
for brightening alright now I'm going to
take the Beauty Blender again
and blend out this concealer
all right now I am going to do my usual
face routine and finish soft with
complete powder little contour and my
brows off-camera if you want to see that
go back through my channel look through
my videos and look for the face routine
I will be right back today I'm going to
be using the morphe 35o palette if
you've never heard of this you must have
been sleeping under a rock if you have
never used more feet shadows they are
really pigmented at a really amazing
price I also sell my liquid lips on
morphe brushes calm not just sound like
an advertisement but they are brand that
I actually believe in love the brushes
and I now sell to their website so check
it out first of all I'm going to be
dipping into these light colors so I'm
going to be taking my Mac to five to
brush my go-to and we'll just gonna you
know take this color and put it right
below the brow I am going to add some
shimmer in a little bit this is going to
act as like my primer I don't really use
eyeshadow primers a lot so I love to put
down a shadow and I like to drag this
past the brow for the transition color
I'm going to be dipping into this orange
one I love this shade and it is really
pigmented this is that Gucci blending
brush number 20 and I'm just gonna place
that right in my crease and blend out
I'm gonna take that and bring it into
the brow bone and we're just going to
take the brush and start buffing up to
get it that really nice blended out look
I want this to look seamless and
airbrush like my vagina getting there I
do like to bring it into my contour on
the nose so it has that dramatic look
alright now I'm going to take this
amazing copper shade right here and I'm
going to be dipping in with the little
bobbi brown eye shadow brush just start
placing this on the lid now what I love
to do is take the mac fix+ this is the
coconut flavor and spray the brush a
little bit
for that full metallic moment and then
once you go on the lid Oh hot hi there
we go so I'm just going to take this and
start buffing it on the entire lid all
right now I definitely need to add some
depth and dimension to my crease so I'm
just going to be going in with this guy
and see how that looks at first
now these shadows are very pigmented so
you definitely want to knock out your
fallout BAM this is a matte shadow so
I'm just gonna tuck this in my crease
right above that copper shimmer just my
lids look really dark and dramatic
alright now we're basically merging the
two shadows with this together and we're
just gonna take it down a hair here I
don't really want it on my lid so I'm
just gonna really gentle and then you
can take your blending brush and go back
in with that orange color and just kind
of go over that darkness again just so
it blends up nicely now I'm gonna start
on my under eyes now for the inner rim I
am going to be using the UH Nastasia Pro
pencil I love this it's not stark white
like I normally do it's more of a nude
color and I'm just going to take my
Beauty Blender as always to get into
that water line so my elasticity on my
eyes does not fall apart
see it's subtle it's not too crazy but
it definitely opens and lifts the eye
okay now that the waterline is done I'm
going to softly add some shading under
it I'm going to take this Mac 239 brush
and I'm going to dip lightly into that
transition color that we used earlier
which is this guy and I'm going to
actually mix it with this other bronzy
color so it's creating its own color I
want to lightly just go under where I
just did the liner now you can actually
skip this part and just do mascara if
you're not feeling as dramatic but if
you don't like drama why the are we
even watching this together it's going
to take it and go all the way always got
to go all the way we're going to
basically connect this inner part with
the below there
we go and I'm just buckling about in
really soft motions now with the same
brush I'm going to take a darker color
dip into this guy right here and I'm
just gonna lightly buff it under my eyes
in between that light and what I just
laid down so it's almost like a second
liner I'm just gonna do it really in
like the middle now I'm going to take my
blending brush from earlier and without
any new product on it I'm just gonna
blend it out little softer now I'm gonna
highlight the eyes and I'm going to take
the same Mac 2x2 brush and I'm actually
going to dip into this metallic shimmer
up here a low metallic now I'm just
gonna take it under my brow bone and
just buff it on a little bit just have a
little bit more depth and shine yeah all
glow now because the lids are really
dark I want to brighten them up a little
bit just add some more dimension you
guys know I'm obsessed with shimmer and
glitter so I'm gonna add this Stila
magnificent metals these are really just
metallic and you can use them with your
finger this one is called metallic peach
and I'm just going to apply this on the
lid and I just love that soft metallic
love mmm how can we make such weird
faces while we're doing anything near
the eye when I'm doing my Skara I'm like
before I apply my false lashes you all
know I can't do without mascara so today
I'm gonna be using the ultra noir black
black mascara from Chanel I love Chanel
makeup they are amazing and I'm just
going to coat my entire top and bottom
lashes with this I love how this mascara
separates the bottom lashes very cute
alright now I'm going to take my trusty
duo lash glue as the glue is getting
tacky I like to really bend the band so
it will form to your eyelid better you
never want it to just be straight how it
comes out of that box you want that
slight curve now I always apply these
with tweezers it's a lot easier for me
of course if you don't like tweezers you
do you and I like to just place them in
the center of my lid and while the glue
is still tacky and drying down you want
to move them around to the desired
location and if the corners are ever
giving you trouble just hold them down
and press in alright now that the lashes
are on I am looking at my eye look and I
think I want a little bit more shimmer
in my inner corner I'm just going to
take the same steal of stuff with a
brush I already used for under my eye
and I'm just going to lightly Pat it in
just a tiny little inner corner moment
yeah nothing too crazy I know you guys
were like oh my god really
more glitter I can't help it it's like
my soul mate glitter
now it's time for the main event
highlighting now there are so many
brands coming out with highlighters so
it's hard to keep up now even though I'm
making my own I'm still a consumer at
heart I am a makeup lover so when I
heard that Chanel put out another new
highlighter I was like okay let's see
what this is all about now it has like
two colors in one so I'm just gonna
swisher that brush around today I'm
going to be using my trusty morphe M
five-10 brush for this I am obsessed now
I'm just gonna mash it around in the
pink and the pearl and create that own
little look let's see if this
highlighter works oh it's really soft
and pretty it has a tiny little reddish
pinky hue in it if my mom in Orange
County 60 miles away can't see this
highlight from her balcony we're gonna
have some problems to add a little um of
color I'm going to be
seeing this color pop highlighter in
shade of lunch money I love this formula
it's really soft and velvety and I'm
going to take the same brush actually
and just put some on it and put it right
on top of this other one so basically
our highlighters are having 4G right now
there we go
whew like when I step outside I want the
Sun to go hiding because it's so scared
of my highlight all right now that my
highlight is complete let's get on to
lips I was looking through all my liquid
lips and I was like look how I haven't
had worn in a while and I think that my
shade 71/4 would go perfect with this
this shade was limited-edition it was
actually one of my top sellers and so
many people have been emailing about to
bring it back so I might have to bring
this back to summer if you want seven
one four and you've never tried it leave
me comments below and let me know if we
should bring it back no lip brush and
just go straight on oh oh my god I'm
dying
all right the lipstick is dry now it's
time to set the face and I'm gonna go
back in with that Mac prep and prime and
I'm just gonna well I'm just gonna bathe
in it all right and this look is
officially come leach all right now that
the look is complete I am actually
loving all the warm tones I use for the
eyes I know I don't normally do that
since I had a cool undertone but I love
it I think I'm definitely going to be
playing with more color and trying
things out of my comfort zone I'm going
to be trying a lot of new things coming
up so if you have any suggestions on any
looks you want to see leave some
feedback below and I will see you on the
next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
