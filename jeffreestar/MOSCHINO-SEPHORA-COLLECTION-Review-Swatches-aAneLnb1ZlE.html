channel now today's video is highly
anticipated the whole makeup community
is so excited for the Massino Sephora
collection including myself now I know
we have all seen where is it where is
the infamous bear do you guys click the
video for the Massino bear eyeshadow
palette when I saw this girl when I saw
this on Instagram I about died this is
the cutest packaging I've probably ever
seen and I know this is going to be such
a hot item for the fall and holiday
season now so 4 has teamed up with one
of my favorite brands of course you guys
have seen me wear you know clothes all
over my channel I love the designer
Jeremy Scott he is a fashion God and he
has turned fashion upside-down with
Barbies and bears and fast food and just
turned it into a whole pop culture
phenomenon and I'm living for it am i
cute shirt you know I had to wear it
because of today's video of course we
are going to go through the entire thing
from the lip glosses and the brushes to
the palettes to the highlighter and
we're going to see if it's jeffree star
approved but before we get into that I
do want to quickly announce and talk
about something really really exciting
if you have not already seen it on
social media
I did a really cool project with some
other Beauty influencers and Benefit
Cosmetics BAM here is the beauty
stowaways influencer kit I am so excited
to be a part of it you guys so if you
have not heard me man emu a Laura Lee
Nicole Guerrero and Karen have teamed up
with benefit and basically this isn't
like a collab like we created the
products this is more of like an
endorsement so we all got to pick our
favorite product that we are obsessed
with from benefit now let me turn this
over I'm sure know not a lot of you are
going to be surprised that I am a roller
lash mascara now the cool thing about
roller lash you guys besides it actually
being amazing and working is that it was
one of the very first ever jeffree star
approved products on my channel and it
really holds a special place in my heart
so you can get this kit and you could
get the roller lash by itself with the
limited
geoffery packaging now of course you
guys know this is my favorite mascara on
earth I was kind of in like a crazy
flashback moment because literally 10
years ago I was buying some of my first
makeup in a Sephora in Orange County
California and it's just surreal to
remember like scraping up dollars to buy
an urban decay lip gloss and here we are
literally 10 years later and I am
teaming up with a brand and my face will
be in every Sephora in America it's just
like a surreal insane moment so we
recently flew to Vegas and revealed the
entire thing and it was such a fun and
just surreal moment for all of us they
think so right now these are available
on Sephora calm and then starting August
17th they will be available in stores
now the kit is really cool because it
comes with a mini travel size so you get
this whole thing for $32 and let me just
pull up the mini you guys look how cute
the little travel roller lash is it is
stunning
so adorable and I just can't wait for
you guys to play with it so if you want
to see me try out the whole entire
bastino so for our collection and keep
on watching all right there is a lot in
this collection so we're going to slowly
go through it all and of course I think
we should open up the brushes first and
use a few of them when we create our eye
look now here is what the brushes look
like now this set comes with five
brushes they are all gold of course as
you can see they have the amazing the
ski note bear heads on the end and this
set retails for $54 okay so here's what
I was afraid of which is not the case as
I was afraid that they were going to
feel really cheap but girl with the bear
and even this feels heavy and nice I
love the bear it's like mmm oh okay
these are soft for synthetic bristles
Wow on the back of the box you guys it
says that there is an all-over face
brush a cheek brush a highlight brush
and a crease and shadow brush okay so
I'm going to assume this is the all-over
one of course now you guys know I did my
foundation contour lush brow
and powder today and then we have the
this must be the cheek brush love it and
then of course the highlighting brush
which is what I'm most looking forward
to today is this little guy okay and
then of course we have the crease and
shadow brushes now these do feel a
little more lightweight obviously
they're way thinner and smaller but they
still have a good weight to them next up
we have this mosquito bear highlighter
now this retails for $22 that is not bad
at all
it has 0.35 ounces in it which is 10
grams of product now in the back of it
that says this highlighter duo
boasts 2 shades that radiates nothing
but love so here's the thing about this
collection is a lot of stuff on the back
doesn't really say like it's supposed to
be blinding it's supposed to be subtle I
am on the website and let me just click
here as we unbox this baby by the way
the packaging and all the stuff is
really really cool you guys it's very
personal from the brand and I love all
the accents of the bears to the logo -
this is not a mosquito toy on the side
it just really fits with a brand and I
love all the little details alright and
here is what the bear looks like now on
sephora.com there is no really info
about this product it really just says
that this limited-edition collaboration
unifies a playful essence of mosquito
with the beauty expertise of Sephora
let's just open this up of course we're
going to put this on our cheeks I'm just
going to take two clean fingers and just
go in right here
bear dome and here is what they look
like okay so there looks to be a little
bit more on the subtle side I guess we
can do little moments right here BAM
that is what that looks like and of
course on the skin it could look
different we will put that on in a
minute but it looks to be like a soft
kind of diffused highlighter which you
all know I'm more into the blinding ones
next product is BAM
this is the mosquito bear eye mask now
on the back of this it says a perfect
sleep mask to wear while jet-setting to
the Milan fashion shows that's cute this
is actually really really adorable
definitely might be wearing this to my
trip this week to Bora Bora now I don't
want to mess up my face makeup so I'm
not what we're going to put this on
might as well you know I'm gonna be on a
plane with this on my head and
everyone's going to be like well the
next product which when I saw this you
guys I about fell out of my seat this is
the Massino bear lip gloss chain BAM
look at how beautiful this is
now I haven't opened it yet but that's
that's some real jewelry this lip set
includes six shades that represent all
of the cities that were held near India
Tyminski knows heart this is actually a
really good value I know that the lip
glosses are more on the mini side but
this is only $32 I'm like oh my god how
the hell they do that alright so here's
what it looks like pulled out let's take
out the Garba so this is this bear chain
oh my god this now I knew the box
is heavy when I was holding it but this
is heavy like it's nice it feels really
nice now here's the thing that you guys
or I didn't even know when I saw it was
actually a lip gloss goes in the head so
if you want to wear a lip gloss around
your neck you definitely can so here are
all 6 shades of course I'm gravitating
towards the hot pink one think all you
do is put the lip gloss right and pop o
it like presses in like it's there like
it kind of clicks in really nice now
once we do the eyes we will test these
out as well and see if they're any good
now let's get to whatever one really
wants to see all right now I think what
everyone is dying to see if it works or
not is the crazy viral mosquito bear eye
shadow palette now of course when I saw
this I was like why is this the cutest
thing I've ever seen in my life this bad
boy is a 48 dollars retail this palette
has 21 shades I'm like damn for that
price point that is not bad with matte
satin and shimmer finishes alright so I
think we got to open her up right now
and see what the hell is in this box
here is the bare eyeshadow palette I do
want to show it off and let you guys
know how thick it is so it is a sick-ass
palette so this entire thing the bare
part just has a mirror and then of
course the eyeshadow
are all on the bottom so this is a bulky
ass thing let's open her up boo boo and
here is what you get the mirror is
honestly a Norma's and let's zoom in on
the eye shadows of course that is what
you guys all want to see here now there
are 21 shades of course they all have
the names under them they range from
pure mattes to shimmers - I guess full
metallics I'm not really sure I do want
to mention that it came with this little
book which i think is like how to get
looks or it's a suggestion of what
colors to use oh yeah definitely
there is Hollywood Paris Milano and
Miami okay so it's basically like an
instruction manual it says prep under
eye with eye cream prime your lid
obviously I'm going to make my own look
and I would try to use as many shades as
possible
all right let's dive into the bare
palette all right now we're going to
plan the lids with of course my favorite
Mac painterly Paint Pot and if you have
your favorite eye primer go ahead and
use that of course lids are primed I'm
going to go in with the top shade here
called a door actually use the Bayer
brush and see what happens okay now
there is not that much kickback on the
fallout did not rain down the palette
let's see it is actually any pigment I
am like so curious like I was going to
do finger swatches before I even applied
it to my lid and I'm like what the
for girl no this is a very light beige
crease color so let's just place her
right in there that blended very quickly
so first impressions on the very first
matte that I've ever touched or any
shadow it blend really easy it's one of
those formulas that reminds me of if any
of you guys watched the storybook
cosmetics Harry Potter I shadow palette
review I did that a few months ago
formula reminds me of that where it's
not really chalky or powdery it's almost
like it's in the pan but then you hit
the brush there's great payoff and that
doesn't cause a mess and I really like
how it just really blended it easy so
let's go in with shade fantasy right
below a door it is a like cranberry red
color and just hitting the pan there's
not a lot of fallout which is great
let's see how it goes on the eye
I'm just going to take this with no
other color real quickly and just kind
of blend that into each other so they
become best friends that color did blend
out good so I think the mats are
probably pretty good I want to put
something metallic or shimmery on my lid
so maybe this one up here it's like a
kind of weird orange let me let this
 take it there you guys this one
is called pennies from heaven oh wow the
brush is very coated she may have some
pigment now of course I love using
metallic shadows wet but we are going to
try a drive first and see affinity
pigment this is so subtle I'm literally
just going to take this on my finger
really quickly and just do what happened
here
okay so you guys see my finger is
covered we're just going to go right in
now we're getting a little sunset vibe
here I don't mind that at all so going
into my finger applied the metallic
pigment way easier than the brush
obviously I'm sure if the brush was wet
it would apply way easier but we will
see you momentarily so I'm going to wet
the brush with some setting spray from
morphe and now we're going to go in with
wet on this side and let's see what
happens
this brush is not living for me let's go
in with a different brush you guys I'm
not feeling this one I'm like I swear
this shadow is going to work for me hey
maybe it doesn't let's try it out
alright so this is a really wet on the
garage let's go in now maybe it's just a
color I'm not really living for it it's
definitely not as metallic as I
personally would want so I wasn't
obsessed with that metallic shade but
it's cute it blended nice so at least it
did what it's supposed to do
I just thought it's going to be a little
bit more metallic so I'm going to do a
little bit of a little inner corner here
we're going to go in with shade angel
wings right here and I'm going to take
this tiny little morphe detailing brush
and we're going to see how it looks that
shade was really cute I also just kind
of drag it down a little bit under my
eye I love it it's a little bit more
brighter than this one on the lid so I'm
happy so far I think it's time to go in
with Prairie flower right here just
because I'm so curious on if they made
this a good formula or not let's do a
little pencil brush here and let's go
you guys this is not bad now usually
these colors are like really likes
tricky or chalky or they don't really
have a lot of pigment right away but
this one is good so far this is looking
nice I'm actually going to use the Bayer
brush and go in to that color and just
kind of give it a little more like a
smoky drama effect I'm dying to try this
black matte shade called magic I'm just
going to put a tiny little bit of black
in the crease here and I'm going to be
very light handed here because I don't
know how pigmented this black is so I'm
just tucking the color magic right in
here now I'm just going to tuck it and
stop it right there all right you guys I
think I've used plenty of shade I'm just
for this look I wish I could use 20 more
colors but I haven't gotten no damn room
so so far so good I was pleasantly
surprised with the formula with this
definitely was not expecting everything
to blend as nice as it did and I kind of
liked this look um okay I am going to
quickly put on some mascara and lashes
to finish this off so I think it's only
fitting that
this is surprising that we go in with
the benefit roller lash mascara this
damn wand is so good it just literally
just grabs the hairs and makes them like
BAM if you are someone that is really
not into false lashes I think that this
mascara is perfect for you because you
literally don't need me and sometimes I
get a little insecure where I feel weird
without beautiful lashes and then I put
this on and I'm like oh I'm fine
so mascara is done now I was going to do
false lashes but I really don't think I
need it and I kind of want to show off
this eye look if you will so mascara is
done now I think it's time to move on to
the cheeks now let's take out our bare
highlighting brush and let's take out
the bear duo highlighter the shades are
called
uptown and downtown now the thinker's
watch earlier was a little underwhelming
but we did not try it on our face yet so
let's get into it and let's see what
happened oh okay it ain't that bad y'all
I'm going to do a second layer and I'm
going to take it all the way back to the
hairline nothing new here this is Q you
guys I am not mad at it let's do the
other side and then maybe just for fun
I'll take the other color which looks to
me a little more darker on the brush so
maybe if you are more on the medium to
dark skin tone it will pop more on you
oh I see kind of it right here it's a
little little duo pink type of moment it
ain't bad alright now I think it's only
fair that we do a little bit on our
Cupid's bow let's mix them both after a
little bit on a nose and then we'll just
do a lid on the chin so first
impressions on this highlighter
definitely was not expecting it to look
this pretty on the skin I think that
finger swatch earlier I was like oh girl
I definitely thought that that was going
to be one of the misses of the
collection but shockingly enough
I'm surprised all right now let's move
into the glosses now of course you know
I got one right in the barrel here so
I'm going to pull out my
Emme and I don't know what kind of
formula this is there's really no info
on the website yet so we are just going
to go in it could be sheer it could be
fully opaque I don't what the hell I'm
getting myself into but there is the
Virgen wand untouched now let's see this
is a fragrance none really it's kind of
smells a little like you know makeup II
like it smells like makeup but there's
no like cake smell or anything wild all
right well let's see what she looks like
alright I'm a little shook at how
pigmented and beautiful this glosses i
am like stealing my Barbie fantasy right
now only thing was little I call these
minis of course that I did have to dunk
in a few more times and maybe with like
a bigger wand but the dough fit was not
bad you see it's like that flat tip
thing so I did have to go in a few times
to get it fully opaque but it did an
amazing job and nothing's on my teeth I
love it yeah I mean not everyone is into
like full pigmented Colossus I know that
but if you are girl
this one is stunning now I think it's
only fair that I quickly swatch the
other four on my hand just so we can
kind of see what the colors look like so
of course there are four more BAM and
let's just swatch them all now so we
have Paris pink Hollywood Malibu and so
hold it let's see what you look like
here is Malibu it is a gorgeous light
nude color here is Soho it looks to be
well let's see oh my god okay pigment
damn now this does have a little bit of
glitter through it which looks really
pretty close-ups almost like a metallic
wow that one is stunning and definitely
has full coverage here is Hollywood of
course that is done name all right here
is all five sludge I am pleasantly
shocked and surprised by the mosquitoes
Sephora collection overall I do want to
give you my box real quickly so let's
just start from the top obviously I'm
wearing this damn look lost chains I
love it I think obviously if you are
into this collection you are into
designer stuff or really really cute
packaging either way you of course are
going to get something really unique and
special now the cool thing about Sephora
teaming up with this brand is that
they've made it affordable it's not
astronomical when I saw the price points
I was like damn
I'm not mad at it usually you guys know
what I say about luxury stuff you are
paying for the name whether it's Gucci
or D or or YSL but with this one it's
kind of cool that they tame it with
Sephora because you're not getting
gouged by like a $60 highlighter so
let's sound off the lipgloss chain I'm
obsessed to it it's heavy its luxurious
and I love the glosses right here I
would definitely wear this and put this
in here this amazing the highlighter
pleasantly surprised on the skin I think
it's really beautiful and if you're
someone that is not obsessed with the
metallic glow I think this is a good
medium and it was creamy it was
buttering and come on the bear compact
disease let's move on to the brushes now
I only use 3 out of 5 of course I will
use the other two in the future just
because they're so damn cute they do
feel soft they feel nice of course
they're heavy I love heavy packaging so
overall I am obsessed with the quality
of these now of course we have the eye
mask of course of an eye mask how do you
really review this you put it over your
head on a flight and you see if any
light gets in and hopefully not so I
will bring this on my trip this weekend
and of course the final thoughts on the
bear eye shadow palette it's different
our approach yes the mosquito Sephora
collection is Jeffrey star approved and
I'm a little shocked like you know me
I'm all down for not working
because I don't think that everything is
always going to be great but this
collection overall is consistently
amazing I'm like now this palette of
course is it practical for it everyday
use yeah you hope you put it on your
nightstand and you open it I love the
packaging I think this is so unique
obviously I know some people are going
to be shady about it at the end of the
day it is a very unique adorable amazing
and very different and I love a brand
that steps it up and just takes it
they're definitely inspiring but has my
brain cooking for some future stuff if
you want to snag a few of these items
from the collection when it goes live I
suggest you run and get it because I
feel like this is going to be something
that will be gone very quickly so thank
you guys so much for watching
first impressions and I will see you on
the next one mwah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
