going on oh look at here my favorite two
patient we're glad they are here with
three patient is this kindnesses nice
brother - how are you is here from wall
support yeah you may drive us home we'll
see you know calm and how can I help you
guys Pepsi today mates go first ok tell
us what's going on over here
sweatin like crazy ok why is that so no
there's got to be the jeans it's
something because we going off for a
long time oh yeah no I mean I can sit
down on the couch a search button ok
mostly an axle on market mostly a target
a few comments here and there randomly
ok saying I spend some you know ok you
have that no leakage are in hillock
vacuum of square on the living room and
what yeah it's ridiculous
yeah and especially with summer
approaching is going to be hot too
literally will jump on we're not in
Michigan anymore now it's going to be
hundred degrees and you're my type of
problems
yeah fair enough the conditions called
hyperhidrosis I'm exceedingly common
hyper meaning above and hydrosis being
just sweat so you have to pay you know
above normal amount of sweat it's not
pathological and not dangerous if it
doesn't bother you it doesn't bother me
but it sounds like it bothers you a
little video so there's a couple options
I would some people the simplest option
is often the best choice in this case
what I recommend and it might not crazy
to you is we inject a little bit of
neuromodulator in there a little bit of
Botox in the armpits but it sounds right
knee a little great then I was like
little house leg majority what happens
is sweat is secreted by muscle and
little tiny microscopic muscles push the
sweat out so by temporarily paralyzing
those muscles you don't sweat and when
you don't sweat it you don't smell so
you what are you mean typically it's
pretty remarkable but with a few
injections in each armpit takes about a
week to kick in you'll have 95 to 100
percent
eliminated for about a year blows my
mind yes we all now the only thing is it
it's a weird procedure a kid I can
imagine yeah how does that work so what
we need to do is shave your armpits that
we have to put on an iodine color okay
we dab on cornstarch and then you need
to sweat so we need to come up with a
way means by which we can get you to
sweat then we are going to notice a dark
visualization a navy blue color where
the sweat interacts with the iodine in
the cornstarch and they'll be able to
see exactly what your economic glands
are we sweat going and then we're going
to check right into them Wow interesting
30 down for that I'm down let's do this
let's do it we need your happy reset
worked on competitors all the exact does
everybody like Daddy or he's like we're
better then we wanted to remove the hair
just so we can really visualize the area
that we're going to treat they have a
little bit of irritation here it's
probably nothing more than mechanical
and what we're going to do is we're
going to clean this area really well
with alcohol we're going to cover it
with iodine and then cornstarch and then
we have a connection
12 years of formal training I'm an
associate clinical professor of
dermatology at two different medical
schools I'm on editorial advisory board
to peer-reviewed journals and right now
shaving Nate's armpit this is much more
than just iodine okay once the iodine is
dry we paint the cornstarch over the
iodine and we're gonna be able to see we
will visualize it this may turn me on
blue or purple almost wherever you
started sweat and you can see it oh wow
look at that I mean oh wow
this side works perfectly we're gonna
have to do this side again or actually
have them start sweating so we just need
to sweat now great all right Nate what
do we have made news going back you want
to run on a stream
yeah but I got to hold my arms up up
yeah come on all right what about mating
to light down without into the block and
then run back to the jewelers that
little Berkshire yeah all right plenty
laughing don't get into a free show yeah
okay you can do it that's exactly what I
want to see long oh that looks crazy
ready to inject and once I get in there
I'll circle anymore
okay great why don't you say goodbye to
those nappy our pizzas we're getting rid
of that they look good on you
thank you God we have a beautiful
visualization of where this eccrine
glands are I'm ready to inject I just
need to clean this demarcate where the
needles need to go series of little
pinches and then you'll be done a little
bit quarters I'm sorry I think I'm good
Oh everybody's a comedian okay here we
go
so this is right where Whoopi and
business a little griddling is it really
helps me space with the injection site
we're just cleaning up the area removing
some of that start some of that iodine
so that we have a clean slate -
objection - we shave the area clean it
with iodine use the cornstarch to
visualize where you're at crime sweat
glands are and now time to inject so
with your permission I'll get started
writing I'm ever gonna be
yeah you're not going to set that I
promise you will pinch sorry sorry when
I open a couple more little pinches okay
full of fusion nice and comfortable
mm-hmm this is it three groups of people
that request this procedure one is
people who have to work in hot climates
within nice clothes
so as an example have a lot of people
who come to seeing from Palm Springs for
real estate agents they're going to be
showing houses and
how to candy and they don't want to
sweat in from the client the other one
which is very timely because the Oscars
just occurred we have a lot of actresses
who wear strapless gowns and they don't
want to show their armpits with the
other anonymity and then third category
is people like you me who just want
gorgeous armpits is that done with one
side head of that field not too bad at
all not terrible i the initial pension
and doesn't feel like there's anything
in my armpit doesn't feel like even
anything went in it's not you can relax
I'm pretty much done torching it I'm
gonna clean up in a second I'll let's do
this I tripped over yeah I'm ready
Nate I'm not torturing you I just want
to clean up a little bit and then you're
going to be on your merry way
yay a consulate yeah link you go
neuromodulators take a couple days to
kick in so about four days from now
you're going to wake up and you're going
to go through your normal routine you're
going to brush your teeth you go okay so
talk to me to put on yet oh I don't need
to prompt you ever know you're really a
like three operation now you're going to
notice you don't need to do it anymore
tonight
can't wait you're going to really it's
the weirdest thing
it's so weird Nate I'm done torturing
you your armpits look absolutely
gorgeous what questions do you have for
me I think I'm great you keep them
looking beautiful and you know don't be
afraid to go out maybe Venice Beach this
number just flexes yeah nice to see you
my daddy too
gender what's happening to the oh right
so it's been about a year since the last
time so I feel like I was losing a
little bit of volume I just want that
external drama for 2015 so let's let's
go I like to be anatomically correct
yeah and go area by area let's take a
look together your nasal columns and
your filter they're beautiful and they
make excellent and they frame a nice
Cupid's bow right here yeah Vermilion
border is really nice we can always shop
in that ever-so-slightly on both sides
but it looks really good okay you're a
little flat in the front here so we
always could consider building a little
typical but they look really voluminous
and yet and what's really important is
the lower lip needs to always have a
higher volume in the upper lip the ratio
should be about one to two or more
specifically if you really want to get
granular one two 1.618
okay and your volume you have a nice
little subtle concavity or your tubercle
fits in all things considered it look
really good I mean you want to make sure
that I see what you see right if you
want to go oh look you in a room named
Porter's field Harper I think I'm gonna
wipe this off I just want it a little
over drop today and then we'll look
through the real truth you're a little
flat upfront but not bad at all volume
down below again look straight is it the
Vermilion border here you want just a
little sharper a little bit yet and
maybe a little in here okay so this is
the belly of the lip yeah and you're
pretty voluminous there but we certainly
can put a little bit okay come on what
questions you have take up there little
down here I know I like the bottom lip I
think it looks great I think just a
little so where'd you see I'm pretty
juicy already but let's put a little bit
and we'll stop and always take a log
here cool I need to get you end up
because yeah well so we're going to put
on the lemon cream okay here leave it
for about 30 minutes okay wipe it off
and that's going to take away 50% of the
pan thank god that's perfect
and this is the final result
No so we're going to design it for what
like wearing at less than 39 it's just
simply not going to work and as you know
the parlament ation is uncomfortable so
yes up to you I'd recommend a 30-minute
session animal okay perfect do another
cream for about 30 minutes let's go
ahead and wipe it off okay starts
perfect I'm feeling down wow they look
amazing I'm so glad we did it it needs a
little extra something for the new year
but they look amazing I'm so glad to
hear you say that it's always great
seeing my favorite ocean yeah and when
you with jeffree star cosmetics when you
buy that island which is probably six
eight months away yes please come visit
during a groans a row taps on islands
that's all you do that I don't want to
buy that it is only a few</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
