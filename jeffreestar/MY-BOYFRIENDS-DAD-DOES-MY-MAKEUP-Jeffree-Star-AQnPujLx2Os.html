channel today we have a special guest
say hello to Nathan's father hey Bill so
Bill's never been on YouTube before have
you never he's never done anything
makeup related and today I brought him
here so first of all we were just on
vacation you know he lives in Michigan
so now he's in LA and I thought you know
what I think you should try to do my
makeup yeah well so it was uh it's been
cooking for a minute and I'm like okay
boyfriend's father does my makeup that
is genius I've hardly ever seen that on
YouTube and when someone knows nothing
about makeup I think that's what makes
this special yeah so what is all this
shit mean to you
we have no idea nothing he has no idea I
was telling him what this concealer was
doing and he's like no I dumped him so
he's gonna attempt to create a soft
Beauty look today and Yuri to dive into
it let's do it let's take a shot I don't
drink he's taking a shot Bill's wife
Cathy of course Nate's mom she's really
worth a lot of makeup huh
I don't think so have you guys been
together 28 years 28 I'm 32 so that's
like my whole life alone that's why it's
high school sweetheart yes so Cathy
doesn't really wear a lot of makeup we
get we give her all my stuff and she
loves the nude lipsticks she likes some
highlighter but she's more simple so I
don't think that he's seen half the shit
at his own house the Shane having a
million looking stone is she and again
I'm not in there what she's doing
exactly so this is gonna be really fun
fish-out-of-water we're just gonna have
fun and if I look crazy good let's go
later we'll go to Cheesecake Factory and
we'll see what happens so we're going to
dive into primer what does this remind
you of Goldschlager so first of all I do
want to know he doesn't know any of
these products are so normally you guys
know like Nate will grab shit I'm gonna
pick the stuff for Bill or he will never
know what's going on here so this is
primer you got to put this on before
your foundation so it sticks all day
yeah so you can do anything all day you
can sway you can go to the gym you can
do an orgy which is very Michigan you
know it's a lot of were just going on
over there fuck the brush just what I do
is I just take it like it's lotion and I
just put all over okay so just try it
and then there'll be little gold flakes
on my skin
right now fuck I'm gonna need more two
palms no oh yeah oh ha ha ha let the
artists work let the artists let it go
Kwon Do sting oh it's sticky the
foundation's gonna be good miss very
luxury we're only gonna pull all the
good shit out for you where's the smell
of smoke vice it's like kind of like old
ladies didn't careless but it's no rush
maybe maybe more maybe I'm being evil
you you're a little bit all right so now
BAM
Beautyblender so when I told bill the
price of the Beautyblender sponge he
almost slapped me he's like $20 for a
damp sponge um I know the makeup roll
it's crazy so we're gonna apply
foundation with this good and we're just
gonna gonna do a little makeup less than
what foundation do we want to use today
everybody out there in the Internet
let's do let's do some YSL this is a
full-coverage foundation give it a
little shake and then with the Beauty
Blender you're just gonna bounce it and
you'll see what happens and it just kind
of blends out and looks flawless that's
it you can use that into like smear some
on and then the the butt of the sponge
to listen it out the entire face with us
with this yeah yeah really give it a
whirl it's a little more darker than my
normal skin tone is more tan hmm Jenny
flick Picasso have you ever met anyone
without any eyebrows and tell me I'm not
everyone in Michigan has eyebrows I've
noticed we're gonna have to change that
next year oh shit I just whacked it
right on the lip you can do that okay a
lot of girls will put foundation over
their entire face and then it makes the
lipstick stay out more man I might run
some of this on my face in the morning
huh
flawless have you ever had a full beard
I'm thinking I'm never seen it but have
you I don't like it

I don't have any brows to conceal you
got nothing to conceal up there you see
any imperfections any wrinkles or dark
circles Jesus it's a rock up here what
are you talking about putting concealer
