channel now we all know I love makeup
but my other passion besides dick and
marijuana is cars I am such a car
enthusiast and girl give me a sports car
and I'm ready to roll baby
so when BMW introduced their first ever
plug-in hybrid sports car I was like woo
when I saw this vehicle you guys my
heart stopped I just want to see you
guys before we even start this video
that it is so crazy for me to even own
this car and be sitting on it because
growing up my first car ever was a 1991
Nissan Sentra
and I think two people hit my car and
this was like when I was 18 and I gotten
to accidents people completely bugged up
my car it's just crazy to like come full
circle so I'm definitely having a
full-circle moment right now I know all
the dudes out there that are watching
 hate pink cars but guess what go
get your own and you can do what
everybody well with it but I turn this
BMW into a bubblegum dream and shout out
to West Coast Customs for transforming
my beautiful car into what you see now
the white rims the trim it is gloss and
matte I'm just going to give you guys a
little car tour so we're going to talk
about the car now this car does fully
take gas but it's also a plug-in so it
is a hybrid which I know we all know
what Tesla's are now Tesla is a full
electric vehicle this one you can put in
a full tank of gas and plug it in and it
just works amazing so before we even go
inside you guys I just want to say that
what made me fall in love with this car
is the ass the butt yes bitch know when
I first saw this on the lot and I looked
at that ass I was like uh I was dry heat
with excitement it was so just beautiful
so I mean you see it has the beautiful I
eight logo I also turned the BMW logo
pink which I thought was cool because
never really you never see that ever so
I thought that was really cool
above the taillights you can see it has
this like space in between it is so
futuristic and just done
and there is a lot of carbon fiber on
this car which we of course had to turn
pink don't play me everybody here's
something that I find a little comical
the trunk you guys ready for it first of
all we're gonna open it this is what the
key looks like for everybody out there
so we're going to call this a trunk
because it is very tiny now I do have a
Tesla SUV so I don't mind the trunk at
all I'm not going to show up to the
grocery store in this and if you're not
filling the grocery vibe of course you
can just put this down and that's it and
you have zero truck so you can
definitely fit like I don't know a bag
of carrots and some cookies in there
besides that there is really no trunk
alright I think it's time that we take
this for a spin and show you guys the
inside of course one of the most unique
features about the car is the doors
which are beautiful got them butterfly
doors now not a lot of brands besides
the Lambo and McLaren have doors like
that so it's really cool and we're just
going to grab the handle and close it
now that we're in the vehicle you really
don't need the key anymore the car will
turn on when you just put your foot on
the brake so I like to put my keys in
one of the little compartments in here
actually is a lot of room so I keep the
clicker to my garage in here some straws
for my Red Bulls or water the crazy
thing that trips out a lot of people
when they come in the car with me or all
they're always like is so silent now
remember it is a hybrid so you're really
not going to hear it that much noise
unless you put it into sport mode and
really hit the freeway so now other cool
things about this car is that it is very
sleek the leather interior is just
stunning and very luxurious like you
just feel like yes bitch I'm ready to
 roll now I love to listen to
music in the car so in this little
compartment here I keep my little ipod
cord you can do Bluetooth of course but
this is just really easy so I just click
in and I'm ready to roll
No
so crazy store you guys this is actually
my second time buying this car I know a
lot of you're like what the
so if you've been following me for a
while you know that earlier this year in
May I got into a really bad car accident
where I walked away pretty much fine
except some back pain but might this car
the first one was completely totaled I
was going through an intersection and
someone decided to turn and try to turn
left before I went through the light and
they completely smashed into me so hard
they totaled the entire vehicle it
smelled like it was about to like catch
fire and I was like scrambling the
airbags went off of my face was a
traumatizing moment like it was crazy
after that I bought a different car
because I was like you know what I'm too
shook to be back in the same vehicle but
um as the months progressed and it was
right around the time that my birthday
was coming up I was like me
I really miss driving the i8 like it is
just such a unique different vehicle so
I made the decision to you know
celebrate my birthday and treat myself
to a second one so you know hi knock on
wood knock on the steering wheel that um
you know know what sit this
 car
it's crazy sometimes like life has been
moving just so fast lately it's hard to
just sit and reminisce about you know
the things that we've accomplished and
you know I always say that you know
materialistic things they don't really
matter obviously they're fun and they're
exciting and they're cool but you know
at the end of the day this does not you
know mean anything no one's cooler no
one's better than anybody but when you
work hard and you treat yourself it is
just cool validation like yeah like I've
 put it in some blood sweat and
tears and you know we all like to treat
ourselves differently some people like
to go on trips
some people like diamond rings some
people I don't know every we're all
different and I'm just such a car lover
now what I find so stunning about this
car is just the way it's shaped the way
it looks it is so like I don't know it's
like a female version of like the
Batmobile when I saw it from behind I
was
oh my god it's just it's up it's like
breathtaking it's like very eye-catching
I think one of my favorite things ever
is because I've posted my car on
snapchat and Instagram is like I'll be
driving down the freeway and I see
people honking their horn now there's a
lot of people just take pictures of
course it's a crazy big car but it's so
cool to see my customers and subscribers
like I'll hear like a honk and I'm like
oh my god like am i doing something
wrong and then I look over and there's
girls waving my lip sticks out the
window like screaming and I'm like yes
it's always like such a cool feeling to
even though it's like a you know 20
second interaction on the freeway it
just like makes my day so if you do see
this car out and about in LA or Orange
County please honk and wave at
me because I love it I think it's so
cool so shout out to everybody that I've
seen this past year I mean I can't hide
I'm on a pink card
I've got your hand and now we're way
down no was it your plan can't
understand
and you bring
everything
and a fire
nigga tell me to hold on time
we could savor
and me makes me walk alright guys I will
see you on the next video and time to
get back to playing with makeup
