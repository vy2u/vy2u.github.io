channel today we are not reviewing
makeup I am unveiling my brand new
rolls-royce Wraith black badge edition
this is a 2018 and we have transformed
her into a Barbie Dream car this was a
dream of mine to own when I was a little
girl growing up playing with makeup and
watching music videos and MTV Cribs and
seeing all this crazy shit on a screen
and then to have a translate in to your
driveway is a little fucking crazy but I
do want to show you guys before we even
dive into anything that you can make any
dream a reality as long as you stick to
being who you are and never taking no
for an answer the sky is the limit
so besides giving you guys that car tour
I also filmed some vlog footage of me
trading in my old rolls-royce for this
brand new one so we see it getting
carted off and me crying no miss gate I
didn't really cry but almost and then we
also showed the windows of getting
tented because bitch TMZ never leaves us
alone around here so
yeah
all right you guys I just said goodbye
to my old rolls-royce it is a it wasn't
even that old but baby when they come
out with something newer and sicker the
car junkie inside of me was like oh Lord
I just had to have it so my pink rolls
is off to the sunset we just traded it
in and we now we have this brand-new
beautiful black bag limited-edition
Rolls Royce rave so it is kind of like
my car but more stuff
so we're doing a window tint where's the
Barbie play tonight so I took off my
Barbie plate from my other car of course
we're gonna put it on this new one soon
it's gonna look so cool it is so
stunning are you guys so today we
brought junior here he is you're the
owner I'm the owner of window baby and
we've been friends for how I met you in
2009 there Wow that's vintage okay
he tinted my first ever pink Mini Cooper
back in the day okay the first one only
so now we're here today doing the
rolls-royce and a few cars because you
know the paparazzi never leave us alone
so what kind of ten are we doing today
we're doing the ceramic team all the way
around if you guys want to walk through
a real quick walk through Geoffrey likes
his tint really Thornton is like anybody
seeing here you guys only be able to see
the pink hair so so we do all the way
around
clearly not legal but at end of the day
we go we have ways around it and then we
go ahead and do the windshield as well
we go ahead and do something very light
nothing too crazy dark but just enough
to give them shade so that he doesn't
get too much Sun in his on face the
benefits of doing window tint is not
basically you get your privacy and also
with the ceramic film you get the key
production that comes with it so you
know that's the difference that's the
difference yeah we really don't this the
difference between like the regular
films that most people get and then when
you start getting to these kind of cars
you want to try to go and use a little
more expensive film to reduce the heat
from coming into the car and this is
like one of like 15 cars that we've done
for Jeffrey already so I kind of know
his like dealer
and a world
Oh
please
nice ride
all right so I think the most iconic
thing about a Rolls Royce is of course
the Spirit of Ecstasy
now usually everything is silver chrome
but baby not the black badge everything
is black chrome including the grille the
emblem and everything you see here now
this paint we're gonna come a little
closer here is all black with mica
glitter and it is so stunning Advocates
rainbow glitter effect and I am just
blown away by it that of course we did
wrap the car West Coast Customs did
transform this Nate surprised me on our
anniversary and I was like oh good
morning so it is now of course black and
pink got to have that signature Jeffrey
star a look to it and Nate knows me so
well now let's look at this engine
because this is insane and I am fine
look at that beautiful 6.6 liter v12
engine baby this is like orange me right
here so this car also has a horsepower
of 624 that is six hundred and forty-two
pounds of torque so there is a lot of
power in this car and I heard that it
might out race every other car that I
own we'll have to see about that another
day all right now if you were someone
that has inter cars you definitely know
that rims are very important now these
are actually the stock wheels that came
with the car and they are 21 inch carbon
fiber and they are just stunning
I feel like I'm in a rap video right now
and I'm just like oh hey but as you guys
can see they are beautiful with the
iconic are are of course in the cab we
have to take my old plate from my first
rolls-royce and put it on here so now
Barbie version 2 is here and the black
and pink together it looks so sickening
now I know a lot of men out there that
are watching this whether you're jacking
off or throwing up I know a lot of dudes
do not like pink cars but you know what
who fucking cares bitch cuz it ain't
yours but I
or just get people saying you ruin the
car with pink bitch it's a world voice I
don't think you've been rolling in if
you think you can bear me all right so
let's hop into the car and give you a
little tour of the inside
the most bougie-ass thing about this car
is the button to close the door now of
course if you're gonna own this car do
you want to close the door yourself I'm
just kidding but apparently some people
don't so there is a button here where
voila the car is closed now this is
basically soundproof in here everything
from the outside world I hear zero up
now which is nuts but let's turn on the
engine and see what happens
another favorite thing about this car is
the fist this button right here is a
seat massager yes that is real basically
it works your back and it is all through
here and also the seats have a cooling
effect so when it's really hot out like
right now it's literally eighty degrees
out in LA everyone else is frozen but
somehow it's hot here but this button
right here will actually cool the seats
when you're driving and you're back
sweating you're in traffic you're just
like not feeling yourself this really
helps with comfort and it makes me feel
like it's not really that hot outside
now in here we're just gonna open this
up and hi in case you're ever feeling
like you know doing our makeup or
someone else wants to always keep it dry
first our mirror handy we're about to go
for a drive and I'm gonna give you guys
a further in-depth tour of some really
cool stuff that I love about this car
looks the goes
Oh
please
making
now I love that Nate helped me transform
this pink because it is definitely mine
now and it is a showstopper when we go
out people are like oh oh okay so it
gets a lot of attention which I don't
mind at all and it's also fine because a
lot of you guys and people that watch me
notice me and I love when you guys honk
at me on the freeway and wave and say hi
whether I'm in this car
the pink Tesla or anything pink all
right now I think the most iconic thing
about a Rolls Royce
besides the Spirit of Ecstasy emblem on
the front is the beautiful stars in the
sky and now these are all fiber optics
and they are unreal you can adjust how
bright they are
you can dim them down at night when
you're driving they're so stunning and
probably my favorite thing about the car
besides the engine
Oh
please
a surreal feeling you guys to come from
nothing and drive this around like some
days I just like pinch myself and I'm
like is this real like four years ago I
was as depressed I have no idea what I
was doing with my life I quit my career
that I had pursued for eight years so to
be sitting in this vehicle it's just a
very bizarre you know like me and my
family the other day we were just crying
because life has been just so blessed
for all of us and my mom you know she
comes from nothing and she worked her
whole life single mother raised me by
herself
my grandparents helped sometimes but you
know it's just nutso to just be able to
experience these moments like they're
just they're unforgettable
you guys thank you so much for watching
this crazy car tour I am obsessed we are
about to go is celebrate and go on a
date so I won't catch you guys on the
next one ma bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
