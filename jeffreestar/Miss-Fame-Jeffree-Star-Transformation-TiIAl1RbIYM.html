channel today I got transformed by the
one and only miss fame hi thank you so
much for helping today I'm so excited to
be able to paint you again I can't
believe it he painted me last year and
it was one of my most viewed pictures
ever on Facebook when I posted it so I'm
like okay you better come back you're
about to see him do a full
transformation from start to finish so
saddle up grab some starbursts and a Red
Bull and get running I can't wait I'm
priming your eyelid using Mike go-to
product for the lid for a shadow which
is Paint Pot painterly I'm gonna mix a
lip liner by Mac it's magenta and I'm
makeup forever product I don't know the
color of this 11 L I don't know if it's
I or lip it doesn't matter do whatever
you want it's maybe a girl line I do
this because I like to map out what I'm
creating and I learned this from like
the classic painters of our time so you
could just see it's a little bit of
structure it it doesn't need to be
perfect because we're going to blend it
now the reason I put this product on
first is because it's this won't dry
this will blend it can move around this
on the other hand anytime you see a
pencil that has black would usually that
means that it's a long wear product and
it's going to dry on the skin
immediately so it doesn't have blend
ability it goes on and it starts to lock
in immediately lay this down and then
blend it as soon as I can so I don't get
that tacky do I effect from a long wear
liner and I find it important to even
blend that first step like you really
want to make things look good as you go
along because the better you take care
of that makeup as you progress through
it the final product is just going to
like look phenomenal okay so we're just
gonna take the product off the back of
my hand on the loaded brush and then
smudge through so we got these eyes
blended ever
setting Li and once you overlay this
over the top of the color that's already
existing it's going to just complement
they're going to be very pretty together
and if anything falls out because I am
using glitter and I'm using a lot of
color we're going to take a makeup wipe
and clean right underneath the eye and
keep it very simple
that's all it doesn't have to be a big
ordeal yeah people freak out they're
like oh my god
using sketch eyeshadow you can buy this
it still exists that have not been
discontinued and a smaller shading brush
by the same company basically will
primarily use the brush the Cosette II
brushes today because I'm familiar with
them and I've gone got very comfortable
with them I'm just putting a little bit
of black to anchor down the outer corner
of the eye but this black isn't just an
ordinary black it has a little bit of
blue in it so it feels with the cooler
story and I'm getting this fantasy
behind me so unintentionally that's
helping me create a color story for you
now you're about to start your journey
of teaching makeup cleitus yeah I'm
going to be all over the u.s. I'm
tempted to go to Brazil I haven't set
that one yet but resilience love makeup
and they love Queen I'm coming with this
is pure white right here this is like a
hundred percent full coverage foundation
powder no I never get to play with this
because I don't even have this in my kit
and I'm gonna blend that but the fact
that it's you can get back like I didn't
have to do anything I'm not even trying
to reach back for more product as a
returning more product so I'm mixing
this is a helium that's helium helium
Mac pigment it's this beautiful pink
that's so good and I mix it with a clear
liquid glitter base I've never tried to
let cosmetic Ryan it out unreal okay so
we need to create a little impact
reading on camera this is also really
good to redefine your your socket line
when you really want that to the
decision lid that that's more ideal for
somebody that's recreating an eyelid
that doesn't have a giant eyelid little
product I'm just going to press over the
top with more pigment I'm just trying to
get as much on there as possible yes mmm
your eyelids going to be my good at good
Ivan's chin up slightly I'm just going
to press looking down a little bit
further right on the center of the eye
ah so a little quick and dirty pro tip
when you're doing
smokey eye and you have fallout use a
makeup wipe of your liking I'm using the
back wipes right now and I'm just going
to fold in half create a nice strong
line I'm just going to go along that
extended shadow that I'm creating to get
a really nice precise shape okay so
basically I put a little bit of Telesis
which is a prosthetic glue on the skin I
wiped with alcohol first and then I put
the tapes with Telesis on the backing so
that they have more long wear and then I
take a little alcohol and iy from the
edges so that you don't get any patchy
glue through the foundation so those are
on I'm just going to use a theater
primer this is cinema secrets lesson
silicone silicone base your skin really
is fantastic so you make makeup look you
make makeup look good and for people
that struggle with maybe gary say pore
size or texture using a silicon based
primer is just going to create a little
bit more of a barrier and smooth those
areas out so that you can go in with a
heavier foundation now we're going to
try the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation stick it's got a it's like a
to me it's a medium tool yeah so gonna
go here throw some paint on it
I'm through pain pain if ready this is
really natural love yeah me soft okay so
I'm just gonna use a Beauty Blender a
brand new Beauty Blender ha never been
touched before never been worn
and we're just gonna tap it there
stipple whatever you want to call it
whatever makes you feel happy inside
so I flatten it and I get close to that
edge and we're good and we're blending
this is the subtle beat we're working in
our beating process and mixing these two
products Kevin a Kwan sxo one sensual
skin enhancer heavy duty cream concealer
and then I'm following through by adding
a little bit of this TV paint stick and
I'm using a spatula I'm going to scrape
that product like so just a little bit a
little bit and I'm mixing it on the back
of my hand and I'm going to use my
little ring finger I'm going to bounce
underneath the eye I create a bit more
of a triangle
I'll go right toward where we get a
smile line where Jeffrey
not half a smile line I haven't smiled
in year yes so I'm just swiping the
collar down the center of the bridge
your labial folds so basically I'm
creating like central and we're back to
binding people and I fold it I squeeze
it like so and then I go to the bridge
because if you keep it very wide it's
going to blow out that high lines your
ribs are yeah okay contour we're going
to stipple this is TV paint stick I'm
using a lot of Kryolan this is all drag
makeup today like heavy-duty bulletproof
going in hard and we're going to just
lightly apply we're going to carry from
the top of the ear and your natural bone
structure when the brush lifts off is
when I flick it out it lifts out from
like the center of your eye and that's
where the contour wants to light on your
face for me like that's how I contour
one of my favorite tricks to minimize
the size of a chin is to do a little bit
of a diamond shape that little B right
there is going to just create this tiny
little pinch of canvas and then the nose
you have a very narrow nose so I do this
because I do it on myself and I want
people to see the trickery though I do
decide to the nostrils because when I
blend that out it makes it super pinched
if we have a white bridge that's the
best way to get that narrowed and also
what is this called with the width of a
nose basically if your nose is a bit
wide at the nostril area this is going
to get a nice pinched finish and now
we're just blending so I'm setting the
face first your highlights with a custom
blend of NARS loose powder and snow
mixed with super white by Ben Nye so
basically I'll take like this another
coup City brush I love the shape of this
brush and I'm using it under the eyes
and just on all the highlighted spots
alright I'm going to take that product
on a powder puff and I'm just going to
beat this is just kind of establishing
longevity in this face because those
creamy foundations actually move around
on the face if they're not set properly
and then you end up getting like a hot
spot that shines or creasing some just
cut
those cheekbones we're baking so now
we're going to be using the benaiah
powder so I'm going to use to set your
contour and I use a big stippling brush
and I'm just going to tap that right to
the foundation to lock everything down
yeah we're using a cabinet Quan
sculpting powder thank you it looks like
this it's like it is it's very fair suit
so I'm just going to dust this for a
long hair line and just going in and I'm
cutting the cheek bone further so I'm
going to take a medium to small eye
shading brush using the Kevin of Kwan
lightly like very light handedly is when
you get a little heavy-handed or if the
shading is if this is too dark it'll get
really hard to work out after the fact
you're like okay my nose is like to
handlebars in prison okay and then we're
going to just dust the tip the nose and
almost like what I did with the chin
that kind of triangle I'm doing that
right here the sides of the nose and I
do the sides of the nostril to I'm going
to do the same thing with the smaller
brush to create a little bit more
definition what's happening I'm giggling
nikoline and I'm sober now I'm giggling
this month remaining two shades the
matte has your ring white yeah you got
this is discontinued so good luck you
could use a white eyeshadow if you
really want to get creative and this one
is number 113 by Make Up For Ever it's a
powder foundation it's fantastic so
mixing them evenly going underneath the
eye and you're just going to go and
reiterate the highlights of the face you
really want to just make it bulletproof
go down the sides of the nose and create
more definition when you contour keep
your contours high and tight you're good
military fade or an ass and Mel's
kitchen Amen sister you need to also put
a little bit of the white where the
nostrils are and that's going to give
like a little light that looks like your
nose is literally the size of a small
Mouse hi hand my brand is that oh my
gosh oh my gosh you see do you know oh
my gosh I'm mixing the shadow we used on
your lab with a little pinky blush from
Elma
gosh so we're gonna just try and do a
really seamless do you wear blush yeah I
do a lightly under my contour sometimes
under my eyes
right and then I'm gonna blend it out a
little bit because it's blush is one of
those things you can get really
heavy-handed real quick you're like whoa
80s all right let's highlight as a
makeup artist I love new things so tell
me about this product this is my
highlighters that are coming out in a a
few months they're called skin frog are
going in I think you had mentioned you
could wear it I'm putting on the eye by
a wet application as well as it's true
it is you wet the brush oh my god she's
mixing a lavender shade with princess
cut the pink metallic one that I used in
my neon tutorial a while back it's
catching a light lowering imagination
where that sheep the formula is very
buttery it's yeah it has bounce to it
oh very packed on that highlight holy
 well I've never use a product
before slits the just eyes are not a
little bit using the brow tines brow
time just always helps me be very God
get it now right now using a lip liner
by Mac cosmetics
I'm just going to and I like it because
it creates this fleshy tone like brow or
blonde brown I like to gradiate the
shading of it out so I'll leave it a
little bit brighter on the inner corner
so it doesn't create a harsh line since
I'm all about blending all these little
things really really seamlessly now I'm
going to set them using you can use any
neutral beige shadow that's light and
this is just going to set and hold
everything in place I'm going to use a
little concealer this morning one that
was check it that's use this Anasazi a
brow pencil brow pencil brow brush a
brush okay so a little pro tip as you
know put white powder underneath your
eyes if you're concerned a fall out I
just experienced it I do not want to
mess with this makeup needs to be
beautiful work that shadow right
underneath the lash line and connect it
to the story line that's happening about
I'm going to use a smaller shading brush
again with a little bit more of a deeper
shade of violet right hundred
information and then another smaller
brush this is pretty flat so I can
create a bit of a line with it going to
take Makeup Forever aqua liner and
number eleven which I use quite often
it's one of my favorite colors I'm going
to tip line that's a tattoo liner in
trooper there we go right and I'm just
throwing in a very fine black line
okay we put some mascara on this lash
and I'm going to highlight the inner
corners of your eyes I usually use a
pigment but this time I'm going to use
glitter glue and this happens to be
heavy metal by okay Midnight Cowboy we
got a more Midnight Cowboy I'm putting a
beauty mark on your face what a
coincidence I have an album called
beauty mark
available on iTunes ding I like doing
this little trick because you know an
iconic beauty always has to leave her
mind zero it just means like it's the
mark of Fame so we're gonna do the lips
we're going to just mix these two
products as a base because I want more
gradiation in color guess what we're
doing I'm using liquid lipsticks on
camera for the first time are you really
I am I'm a classic like lipstick liner
in Bluffs girl but for this I really
wanted to play with your product so you
chose blue honey and I'm new which is
amazing combo let's do it let's see how
it looks
I'm really concentrating this color on
the help skirts of the left it's so full
coverage mm-hmm I'm just going to try to
keep everything in the center right
second wow I'm going to use some black
eyelash glue duo these are from alcone
alcohol calm three hundred and three
hundred t I use them on miss fame every
time and sometimes I add a bigger lash
if I want to go more dramatic make sure
that there's a Bend so fold it a little
bit so that they don't get wonky and I
always lift the outer corner of the lash
because I want it to create more
elevation so I'm not trying to go with
the natural shape of the eye for the
final product it's really important that
you keep lifting everything that the
liner and every application is about
elevation and I go back and forth I'll
do the left the right left right or vice
versa and then you just kind of work by
pinching and pushing and making sure
they're anchored down and elevate it and
I'm just doing with fascinating you use
this now my go-to I'm going to spray you
with some severe up in here marble which
is what
he used to go underwater and make your
makeup not come off it's rated Marvel a
tough film forming barrier to seal 3 at
Racal makeup so you can hold tight wow
you guys I've never heard of this I'll
be buying 20 fees once he leaves my
house thank you fame what are we doing
I'm just grabbing the shortest one with
one of the other end adapters and I'm
going to pull as much as your face will
allow me to oh hi there like yes
basically I fetch it for my grandma yes

final finished
miss fame creation it took a minute but
we got there isn't it gorgeous I can't
breathe I can't think like I feel like
I'm dying I'm dead you are so good I
love looking at this face it was a
pleasure to paint you again thank you I
wish you'd do this more often
honestly I can do this often oh you want
to move in yeah there's a room available
for me below me yes I love creating this
color story I've not worked with this
specific family of color and look at it
it's like its cohesion
it's from the lid down to the cheek and
it's brought in to deliver I got to play
with your products today I did add a
little bit of gloss because I'm a gloss
girl for personally but I'm not afraid
of going mat now and your lip things are
off the hook thank you so
