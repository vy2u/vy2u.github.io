high the spider Club Paris Hilton the
whole nine the whole thing you know II
mean so I'm tired I don't unless we're
getting paid we don't leave the house Oh
about getting there kind of I know I
think for me I've just seen so many kids
like better in the entertainment
industry and that are similar ages mine
start drinking and circling out and
really like lose themselves in
entertainment and nightlife and I'm just
so business focus that I don't get not
to happen to me yeah good for you I just
have no like yearning to try it at all
but business is fun oh yeah like
people's people that are like I I'm in
show business but I just like the show
I'm like
break the business the bracelet but some
people I'd rather be up until 3 a.m.
like refined a business emails and like
planning out new video concepts linking
show concepts but see a lot of yeah
no not wait site now hmm too much bread
interesting so brave so full meat cheese
in the bunt playing you know about
skinny legend right oh I heard about
that
and Mariah wait we're not going to try
to be like those kids that want to kill
Slenderman or whatever is that a thing
where's that it's a like it's like a
whore it's like the boogeyman
ok no this is not that no okay go go off
on Feeny legend give you okay so right
Harry
this kiddies legend in the entire world
do you miss teen legend means if you're
talking to miss about Miss Mariah Carey
and you're gonna apply that she is not
emaciated I'm gonna slap you in your day
face right now Anthony Hopkins he
reached we're just I'm just making fun
of the idea are you implying that Mariah
thinks she's too skinny because no no
it's just it's a meme of Widow right is
this Kimmy's first in the world there's
not much skinny I agree I'm a backup
dancer in the whole the millionaire the
whole thing Photoshop
no no forty she kept it in between the
raindrops but according to Harvard
scientist Murray has officially
subliminal it into a guy making her the
office Errol she is a gaseous mass and
she is ethereal literally she's girl
mmm-hmm she's she's transparent hosting
that event word I know that you could
use yeah go stain yes yes she's ghosting
no but she's so thin she could be a
ghost sentence put a ghost on the left
didn't need to teach me and James
anything um yeah Allah Allah
we'll just start from the beginning okay
um first of all let's see I would say
that I am genuinely worried about the
community under this administration for
reals uh-huh I love that young people
are becoming real live activists okay is
that so freaking important and I am one
of the people that will say like yes
it's your generation that's gonna fix
the world and I admit as a baby-boomer
that we did kind of fuck it up because I
think during Bill Clinton who I know it
could be a dirty dog but he was a good
president who so can I think during
Obama we've got a little complacent and
I like thinking like okay like we're
making progress and then it turns out we
went back to the Nixon era sure did
which wasn't so good for women or gay
people no it's insane yeah it must be
crazy honestly for James to be in a
world where Donald Trump's the president
he said at such a young age like I would
have never imagined me at 18 this would
be going on I mean all the stuff that
they say it's it's not it's really dark
yeah it's very alarming on the eye and
growing up in school history was a class
that was really good at but never found
interesting at all yeah I was very
I was gauger things in it but I
personally felt that I was bad at it
yeah it was my least worst performing
class out of all that I guess you would
say out of it because like I've never
cared all about politics up until this
year yeah until last year rather right
like once this all started going down
I've tried our best to learn as much as
I possibly can because you have said
yeah I was instead of obviously
balancing everything else so I do try to
always read articles and do this much
research and my free time because it's
so spooked I'm just saying like as much
as is Trump is doing this or that shiny
object
Jefferson Beauregarde sessions in the
Department of Justice they are busily
chipping away at equality rights gay
rights rights so people like to act like
oh this will be over and it was a phase
yeah but some of those like Supreme
Court justice gorgeous as Gorsuch is
known to be anti-gay and he's not a
progressive person in any way so I just
love that you guys can talk to people
and go yeah you have to get involved
because they're coming for you you know
anyone who's considered disenfranchised
gay first of I almost think people think
it's a joke like Trump's a joke but I'm
like no all these laws and things that
he's doing a real and
reality and I know people here's what
I've noticed from just traveling I'm not
gonna speak for everyone we never can do
that but a lot of people are just so
sick of seeing him on the news every day
they literally just don't they check out
check out what I don't care and they
think oh it doesn't it doesn't matter
nowhere let me over too much every day
they're tired of seeing it it's a lot
the news or it's just constant hell yeah
I can't even remember what happened a
month ago I know it's fucking brutal I
want to get back to one news less boring
I want to get back to those days like we
didn't really even know like what
religion the president was and yeah it
doesn't matter yeah that's right even
like you yeah that's what you're
horrible if you're not like me now that
is the new for being on makeup it's like
half the world loves us half the world
things that's wrong like wrong all right
they're bad wigs
let me try you nervous does that of
course we've never met god I'm getting
I'm getting a real grasp on that term
yeah so I'm not picky who would like to
anyone can put anything in my mouth
so okay all right so sorry I'm spelled
literal okay so me and you at the same
time they're having yeah
I mean that was wig and I don't want to
hear your arguments that way it was full
wig wag wag I'm bull anyone pull I'm
very fucking fall oh oh oh oh my gosh oh
look at that it was like the Beyonce at
the VMAs things that big reveal big
reveal big reveal how do you go by
James's die
how'd your sty swollen is it good for
the baby yeah mm-hmm it doesn't look
that bad it doesn't you I really so
could only see it but I think way
tomorrow it'll be gone okay but look at
the fucking monitor both guys are both
completely open right now don't blame
the monitor the monitor would does not
deserve that I did nothing to you
no let's say when James is on the way
here he said that yeah if you rub a gold
ring higher than 18 karats on your and
for some reason it's gonna make this
that go away tomorrow so we might try it
away we have a lot of videos to film
tomorrow so I'm praying
he's got compresses going he's gonna
have saline solutions he's gonna be
buying gold rings I'm gonna be careful
yeah you see I'm just running through
Rodeo Drive taking all the Rings on the
street
everything party day is shaking mm-hmm
wait you think white gold counts I am
NOT doing this James I don't know if I
can go away legally applying this is the
least likely glebe like it that's a good
movie if you wake up science worse what
we can't don't I think we can make an
eye patch we've got to make something
work no we'll do two but we can do four
with an eye patch that's gnarly
yeah what if you do want me to eye
patches just think about it I'm just
saying it that's blindfold makeup
