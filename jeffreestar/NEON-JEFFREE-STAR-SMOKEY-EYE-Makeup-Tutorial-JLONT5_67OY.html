I have so many makeup tutorials coming
for you guys I wanted to start the new
year off with a bang and do one of my
signature neon looks now I have been
getting so many requests about a lot of
different looks so cool thing about the
my channel we have all day I'm here to
do them all so today I'm going to be
bringing you some neon fierceness this
is one of my signature looks I have been
doing since the beginning of time and I
wanted to update it and do the new 2016
version so enjoy watching this look and
I also changed my primer and foundation
for this video because the weather is
changing in California and things are
just a little different on my skin so
enjoy watching guys I want to have zero
fours today so the other day I bought
this new YSL primer it's the two Shekau
blur primer now this actually has real
flakes of gold in it and it felt really
nice it dries quickly and my foundation
looked flawless so I'm going to be
getting this on today and I'm just going
to apply this with a Gucci foundation
brush
don't forget the neck y'all and I'm
going to do a little bit on the ears
okay now the drying time for this is
like five seconds already dry it already
blurred my pores now today I want a full
coverage foundation so I'm going to be
going in with that Kat Von D locket
tattoo foundation this is my old school
favorite it stays on so if you're caught
in a rainstorm your foundation still
going look cute and I'm shade 46 light
so I like to just put this right on the
Beauty Blender
a damp one of course and we're just
going to dot it around now the cool
thing about this is you do not need a
lot of product this covers your entire
face so let's get to blending
I'm just going to set my foundation and
do my brows off-camera which you can see
how I do all that in my official face
routine which is on my channel so I'll
be right back alright now that my face
is officially on let's get down to the
look now because I'm going to be doing a
lot of bright neon today I'm going to be
using the Kat Von D high voltage
eyeshadow primer I love to apply this
within back to 5:00 to brush and I just
use a dot if you've ever used this
before you know a little goes a long way
with all of her products so I'm just
going to dot my lid and then take this
brush and start sweeping it all over so
my neon eyeshadows stay put
and as always I'm going to sweep a
little bit under the eye but not too
much now we can get to our eye shadow
now I'm going to be using this busy art
editorial eyeshadow palette this white
color you guys I've used it before this
is my favorite it is a nice base for
bright shadows and I'm going to be using
this pink on this one and for the yellow
I pulled out one of my old Mac eye
shadow palettes that I made myself so
this yellow is called chrome yellow so
we're going to be dipping into this
color today as well with the same brush
I use my primer for I'm going to be
going right to that matte white and I'm
going to highlight my brow bone with the
shade and also put it on my higher eye
area now notice how I am doing packing
motions I want to pack this eyeshadow in
so it does not leave me and we're just
going to pack and pack and pack all
right now the first color I'm gonna be
laying down is this bright pink now I'm
going to be using a morphe for one one
brush to pack some of that in I'm gonna
saturate this brush completely and then
if you want to avoid fallout BAM now I'm
going to start this look since I'm going
to be doing three colors pink yellow
pink I'm going to start this by just
pack
on the pink on the outside all the way
to the lash line and then backing up a
little bit
and once again I'm doing a lot of
tapping motions so it packs in that
color and it has minimal fallout and
this is just going to be our guide so
this does not have to look perfect this
is just to start the look then we're
going to take that pink then tuck it
inside so notice how I'm leaving an area
in the middle for that yellow color if
my eye doesn't look like a unicorn threw
up on it in ten minutes we don't have a
 problem now to create this
trifecta we're gonna pop a color right
in the middle and start blending back
and forth so I'm going to be using this
morphe bullying that brush this doesn't
have a number but it's from the bling
collection I'm obsessed with this I'm
like I just want to eat it I'm gonna
saturate the brush so it's like neon on
there and then we're just gonna place it
in the middle and you want to buffer it
back and forth and really press it in
there so it sticks and if you blend good
enough it should turn a little bit
orange around the corners so that pink
and yellow are basically like getting
married and having a baby in your eyelid
then you can take some pink color and
start blending more so if your eye does
not look like a sunset by now you have
some issue girl okay now to soften the
lines up here we're going to be taking a
Mac two to four brush and we're gonna
dip into the pink and lightly merge the
top together so I do not want this black
raccoon rainbow eye I want it to look
very soft and pretty so we're just going
to take a little bit of pink on this and
follow the line that we've already
created and just start blending up and
just softening it
now if you want to make the top even
more blendable we go back in with that
white color and we lightly go over the
pink again and that looks very airbrush
I know I say airbrushed a lot but that
is the effect that we are going for
before I add any darkness to my
under-eye I'm going to be taking this
more feet III brush which by the way it
feels like the velvet lowered and I'm
gonna be taking this Laura Mercier
pressed powder and I'm gonna just place
a little bit under my eyes so only
reason why I'm doing this and you
haven't seen me do this in other videos
because I'm going to really smoke out
that bottom and I don't want to deal
with any fallout
I was always I'm going to be going in
with my Mac smolder I pencil this has
been my favorite black eyeliner since
like the beginning of time so I'm just
going to take a damp Beauty Blender and
as always slightly pull down so I'm not
ruining the elasticity of my eyes and
I'm just putting this directly in the
waterline doesn't have to be perfect
we're gonna smoke it out in a second now
my eyes are very bright so I do want to
create some darkness underneath so I'm
going to be using this on a stop see a
shadow in shade peacock it's like a
forest II jade green and I'm just gonna
be taking this Mac 219 brush and
basically smudging the black out with
the green on a brush BAM
fallout is gone let's start blending I'm
just going to start from the inner
corner and a lot of little small back
and forth motions almost like I'm
drawing it on and I'm just gonna lightly
start dragging across the entire under
eye
now notice how I'm taking it a little
past my actual eye so it gives it that
really dramatic like BAM moment blending
leg forward you lashes and mascara I'm
going to add a little bit of glitter in
my inner corner and I found this glitter
from lit cosmetics and it's called share
sea HP are y'all not like I'm gonna
share a piece of candy we're talking
share the icon is like a silver rainbow
disco like I don't know if I could have
sex with a glitter it would definitely
be this one it's a little Tom Ford eye
shadow brush and I'm just gonna directly
place this on my lid and see how
up I did it now I know some of you are
gonna slap me in the face we're not
using any glitter glue or adhesive and
I'm just going direct from brush to face
but it's staying on there
okay let's start our lashes mascara I'm
going to be using the benefit roller
lash mascara I recently tried this and
now I'm like I'm hooked and I'm just
going to coat my entire top and bottom
lashes
alright mascara is done okay now for
lashes today I'm gonna be trying put a
beauty's Carmen lashes I've never used
these before so let's try them
as always I'm going to be using my vegan
lash duo glue now I'm going to just take
these with some the lower lash tweezers
and just lay these right in the middle
on my lash line
and then play around with the placement
whoo these are dramatic
I'm obsessed already all right thank God
the first lash is perfect but the second
one is giving me a little bit of
problems so I'm gonna take a quick
little smoke break on my one hitter
all right Gandalf don't do me wrong hmm
let's start now I'm gonna be using one
of my brand's new highlighters I have
been creating a bunch of new shades in
the lab some of which I'm gonna use some
which I'm not I am in the testing phase
I created this pink metallic shimmery
goddess gonna be trying this out today
with the morphe 510 brush this is my
favorite for highlighting right now you
guys know I love my metallic glow I want
to be brighter than Luke Skywalker's
lightsaber and by the way I wore one of
these the other day and my grandma is
like almost blind and this bitch was
like back to 20/20 now as always I'm
gonna put this highlight right above my
contour and almost merge them they're
gonna have intercourse right now if you
can't see how amazing this glow is at
home turn your damn phones and computers
up oh my god we're gonna add a little
bit over here I'm gonna apply a little
bit right above my Cupid's bow so my
mouth is like hi how you doing hi now
I'm gonna do a little bit on my nose and
we can do a little bit right above the
brows so they can have their own little
moment highlight is like past being on
Blake on deck it's on everything now I
was just looking in the mirror and I
want to add a little bit of color to my
cheeks to finish the look before the
lips so I pulled out that big blush book
from Tarte
and hi packaging everything I'm obsessed
but good morning I'm going to be using
this beautiful orange e glitter shade
with gold in it and it's called glisten
and I'm going to be using this NARS
kabuki brush dust a little bit on a
little back and forth motions I think
too much I'm kind of gonna create just a
little bit of color cheeks on plate now
last but not least the lips now since my
eyes are really bright and crazy my hair
is neon I'm gonna tone down the lips and
I'm gonna be using Kat Von D's liquid
lipstick and shade Requiem my girl Kat

lavender but it's a nude so you're like
