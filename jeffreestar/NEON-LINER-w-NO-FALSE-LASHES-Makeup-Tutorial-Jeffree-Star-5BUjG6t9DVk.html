my channel now today I'm going to be
giving you a little nyan liner bright
neon liquid lip type of vibe now I did
this look in my June favorites but I
have that hot yellow liner and everyone
is like oh so we're gonna recreate that
whole look for you guys in this video
and I swapped out the yellow for this
neon green it's summertime it's
scorching out here in America and I just
want to be radiating now you see that
highlight I used a highlighter that I've
never used before on camera so besides
the highlighter what else is going on
you guys so as you can see my hairline
is really growing out I got to bleach
some of it I'm going to show you guys
right now so a lot of this is still my
brown hair but I got to bleach some of
it so I'm so excited I have my real hair
back of course I will never stop wearing
wigs but I am really feeling myself so
if you want to see how I created all
this then keep on watching let's dive
into the summer good enos now let's talk
about skincare for a second I have tried
to not age for about 15 years now and I
mean I can say I've done a pretty good
job I'm trying to like just stay away
from the Sun all together so I know
normal people leave the house and they
don't hold umbrellas over their head and
they don't wear 20 layers of sunscreen
but I'm not normal first to prep the
skin I'm gonna be using that Giorgio
Armani maestro UV primer now the cool
thing about this yes you can really read
that SPF 50 and that is not a lie it
really does have that so I like to shake
this guy and as like a dropper and I'm
just gonna put some all over my fingers
I'm like I'm just gonna touch the
dropper and you're just gonna blend it
into your skin okay so we have our
sunscreen on now of course what are we
gonna do we're gonna do a little bit
more primer and I'm going to be using
that grill an L ' oh our I never got to
pronounce this and everyone tries to
read me for it so this one does have
real gold flakes in it we are going to
be a little just a little BAM on the
cheeks now wherever I hate my pores I'm
really gonna let that soak in and I'm
gonna
drag it all around all right face is
feeling snatched let's dive in the
foundation what the f are we gonna do
today y'all I'm feeling a little
luminous silk foundation I mean it's
summer hello we're gonna shake that up
and then I think I'm going to mix in
this foundation that has SPF and this is
baile Mayer this is called the treatment
fluid foundation and it's a little
darker than my usual color so I like to
mix it and just give me a little a
little added warmth a little summer glow
a little tan we're going to use the back
of our hand and just do a little one two
three and then we're gonna take the
lemare and we're gonna do a little one
two and that is enough to cover your
entire face neck ears chest and mouth
obviously you guys know I have my damp
Beauty Blender on standby but I think
I'm going to use our teeth brush and
this is the oval-8 I'm just gonna there
we go so I'm going to take that same
brush and just kind of got this all
around now that is a lot of foundation
but hey I'm going to the pool I don't
want any Sun to penetrate it's time to
blend
oh right we are blended I mean we are
blended now my real face is and not this
dark so my chest area is like albino so
I'm just going to take the leftover
foundation and just kind of dot it in
there and try to watch my jacket my
chest is like okay now for concealer
we're gonna do the Too Faced Born This
Way and what shade are we we're very
fair okay but for real this concealer is
so amazing basically this concealer is
my new favorite I've said it a million
times since I've used it and I'm saying
it again let's get to blending now I'm
gonna be using the oval 7 I use the 8
from my entire face now we're going to
use the 7 for this concealer and let's
buff it out
all right we are blended to perfection I
am obsessed with these guys for
concealer I'm just like oh even though
our face is snatched it's time for some
setting powder because we got to make
sure that meninist moves some go into my
trusty LOM RCA and my damp Beauty
Blender and we're gonna get to setting
no you guys know what I love to do dip
in it's just gonna melt into the skin
and then for the bigger areas of my face
I'll take the end of the Beauty Blender
and just kind of bounce in there and
then alright we are all set now let's
get to contouring all right now for
contour today we're gonna be using that
Kevin tequan sculpting powder and shade
medium with a little morphe 5 to 7 of
this guy we're just gonna give it a one
two three on these cheeks
alright now for that look that we're
recreating from the June favorites I
didn't do my contour all the way down
and severe I kind of stopped it here
normally I like to go a little sharper
and just cut down my whole neighborhood
but today we're just gonna softly go up
and Adam Jack home already doing my
forehead like I'm just gonna do the left
side of my face today and see what
happens and then I was gonna take a
little morphe brush with no pigment on
it and just kind of really define it
like oh wow
then we're gonna really dark in that
forehead and let the doctor know that
we're not playing today now we're gonna
hit that chin and kill that jawline oh
now last but not least or Willie get
that fucking look down we're gonna be
using the little artiste brush for
contouring and I'm just going to hit
that once BAM that's really all you need
and I'm really gonna chisel the nose
like so weird today we're like people
are gonna think I had surgery when we're
done with this look honey
all right now we're gonna leave the nose
that crazy of course we're not but we
are gonna buff it out real quickly and
I'm just going to use a little damp
Beauty Blender and I'm just gonna press
up and down those lines and soften them
but still keep them harsh just not as
crazy as they look right now now I like
to stare at myself for as long as
possible with a blinding highlight so
I'm gonna do my highlight right now
right right right now
now I discovered this new little Kevin
Kwan highlighting brush look at this guy
who is like a dome girl now I'm gonna be
using my sweets glow kid from Anasazi of
Beverly Hills today these just came out
in hello summer
look at that color this one is called a
marshmallow and I'm like ah get on my
face
but we're gonna take this guy we're just
gonna do a little one too oh this has a
lot of pigment thank you Jesus
now this brand never lets me down and
this guy I'm just gonna pop on my entire
oh wow
cheeks come on Kevin upon with this
brush and I'm just gonna tuck this right
here this is like a ball lightning come
on sunshine when I see you girl I am a
loving it we're just gonna hit that
Cupid's bow right now so I'm talking the
whole time my mouth has a little more
character oh I love this and now do I
need to hit the nose just a tiny bit so
we're just gonna go back and forth on
the tip of the nose
joint even more highlight I mean this is
Geoffrey here without we're talking
about so of course we do so I'm gonna
bring out the other new honest hacia
glow kit and this is in palette
moonchild I love that name now these are
like pastel with reflex they are so
pretty so this one is called Lucky
Clover and I'm just gonna hit that one
up for a second and I'm only gonna put
this on the high plains of my oh my
highlight was so severe my voice in a
way the high plains of my cheeks now
this just gives it kind of a whole
otherworldly dimension which hello it's
summer can we have some fun people now
what do we need to do we need to give
some brows on so for brows today what
gonna do since my hair is back to being
fully pink I'm gonna use the anasazi
beverly hills dipbrow shade auburn which
is for redheads and it kind of has like
a brown reddish check which I love when
you have darker pink hair and I'm going
to be using that brow is in shade taupe
that's what I'd like to do to define the
shape and of course there's no stencils
involved there's no tattoos there's no
magic I just freehand them on and let's
give it a whirl
now to make this look really dope we're
going to be using some Willie stark
white eyeshadow this is from that visi
art editorial palette I love this yes I
accidentally dropped this but thank God
none of the shadows cracked I'm gonna be
using a little Mac - five - brush and we
are really gonna highlight under the
brow so we're just gonna drag this out
and just merge that in and look at that
this is like a little full full drag
brow today next step is really easy
we're just gonna take a little blending
brush and another blending brush and
we're just gonna dip into the lower Li
violet Voss palette now this has really
great neutrals I love these colors the
look that we're gonna recreate I
basically had like a transition color
coming all the way in here cutting out
my crease and I left that blank and I
did that really bright neon liner so
we're just going to take a topi color
and we're gonna take it all the way in
and cut out that lid and then we're
gonna leave this all blank for that neon
liner to have its own moment so I'm
gonna be dipping into a ragamuffin right
here and we're just gonna tuck this
right in here
take this color a little more and then
we're just gonna tuck it in put a little
bit on that lid just so it kind of all
flows together so I am going to blend
this out of course we are not leaving it
like that but I'm just going to sketch
it out on the other side as well and
then we'll get to buffing and blending
now we're going to take this latter
shade called mama bird we're just going
to dip into that and then we are going
to blend out and make this look really
airbrushed and then I'm gonna dip back
into that white eyeshadow with the first
brush and I'm just going to tuck that
white right in there so it really cuts
that out like hi come back and we're
just gonna leave that blank and then the
same thing for the top we're just gonna
go over and make sure it looks really
blended alright now let's get to the
neon liner last time I use this hot
yellow which looks so stunning this one
is called dance party and I think it's
sold out like immediately if you guys
were like hi I need that too this is the
hot green one what's this one call this
one's called fanny pack
hi really cute so these are water
activated now last time I use this
really really tiny brush this is the 202
liner brush from Smith cosmetics I love
this guy and this is water activated I'm
just going to take a tiny little bit of
water from this hi I've known strata
Atlantic before you got the wrong one
I feel like a Super Bowl commercial but
this is just my favorite water I am just
gonna pour a little bit in this cap now
we're gonna take that liner and we're
just gonna move it around huh oh so
pretty I want to scream so I poured out
some of the water and now I'm just going
to kind of move it around and then it
gets really pigmented
so you're just gonna want to take the
liner brush and oh my god alright now
I'm going to bring this up a little bit
and just kind of put it over our
oh all right the liner is done and these
also come in a lot of other shades so I
can't wait to get more under there's
like a hot blue there's like a pink and
they also have like black silver and
other cool colors so definitely gonna be
getting a million of these this is gonna
be like my new staple color I'm like oh
what is next
mascara and you're probably like what is
that it that's all I did the other day
now you can take something in the
waterline if you wanted to add a little
pop for mascara today I'm gonna be
taking that iconic mascara from Gucci
this is my new favorite I love the brush
on this guy it is so easy to work with
and we're just going to coat our entire
bottoms and top
all right now for lips today I'm going
to prep them with some lip scrub this is
my own of a lower lip scrub and flavors
spearmint and I like to just take some
on my fingers and just go to town
all right lips are smooth and ready now
today I'm going to be using my own the
lower liquid lipsticks in shade a
watermelon soda and we're going to dab a
little bit of the nude beach in the
center for some extra dimension of
course I'm going to leave a little bit
in the center for nude beach so I'm not
going to fill it in all the way
and now we're going to take a little bit
of nude beach and we're just going to
press it right here and then we're gonna
take a little more key eyeshadow brush
and we're just going to blend this in I
love how this looks now of course if you
want you can do a dot in the center on
your top lip I kind of like to just
leave it on the bottom so it gives my
lips that extra like alright guys so
this look is pretty much done you really
don't need anything else of course if
you want to add on more highlight
because you have really bad crazy
obsessions with highlighters you can
always dip in and just you know do a
little bump it's been you know probably
like 20 minutes since we've put on you
know the highlighter so of course if you
want to read you more of course you can
but besides that I think we're gonna
need a little bit of setting spray okay
so since it is summer we're gonna bring
out our taught jet dewy skin mist and
we're just going to shake and shake and
I wish Nathan is here to help me with
three more setting sprays but um let's
get our engines ready and let's get to
spraying all right I think this look is
complete alright guys this look is done
it is probably one of my quickest looks
I think taking away false lashes and
tons of eye shadow obviously saves you a
lot of time so of course if you want to
tailor this look do some black wings
some silver some gold some yellow any
color will work I think it's summer it's
fun I mean I don't even care if it's
Christmas time I just want to wear
bright colors all the time and for lips
it could really swap this out with
anything if you're afraid of bright
colors just to a straight-up nude and
you're still going to slay or just do
some light gloss and call it a day now
one last tidbit I will have for new skin
Frost high lighter shades coming out in
August so saddle up and I will see you
guys on the next video bye guys mwah
I'm holding this brush so weird like
what's up grandma let me let me cover
that your little for a girl
thank you it just blends really
effortlessly oh yeah
shut up um um food so last time I used
the hot you hear that word to use what
just watch I like douse it everywhere
mmm
so oh my god sorry my dildo machine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
