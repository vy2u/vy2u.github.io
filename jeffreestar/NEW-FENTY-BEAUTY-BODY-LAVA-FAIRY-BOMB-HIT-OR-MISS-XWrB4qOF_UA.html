channel hi how are you are you ready to
glow today because today we are going to
test out the brand new Fanta Beauty
highlighters there is a liquid one and a
puff literally a puff full of glitter
that is allegedly gonna make us look
mystified and maybe like we're in the
Twilight series but I am very excited
for new highlighting products anytime
there is something glow beyond the
market I have to test it out I know some
people are over the highlighting craze
can't relate so today we're going to
test out everything on my body and we're
also gonna go outside and see how it
looks in the Sun I know it's snowing in
half the country but we do have to get
ready for summer so I am very excited to
test these out today now I was in
Michigan literally last night just
landed and I grabbed these from Sephora
because the pr boxes aren't even sent
out yet but bitch do you think I want to
wait to review this no I gotta try it
right now and I'm meeting tweets all day
if spent you check first are approved
and I'm like yes venti is but are the
new highlighters I have no idea so if
you guys want to see some highlighting
action keep on watching so the first
product and I have seen this all over
Instagram everyone is talking about it
it is the new body lava body illuminizer
now this is a liquid highlighter hybrid
it will go online and see what it is
supposed to do exactly before we test it
out and of course we've all seen the
viral video of Rihanna turning her
shoulder and putting the highlighter
right here so we will definitely test
that out and see how it looks today so
we have the liquid highlighter we also
have the brush today of course had to
get the brush to try it out and we also
have the berry balm which I cannot wait
to try this it says it's a glittery
pom-pom so first of all what are we
waiting for it we need to dive in right
now alright so let's pull out the body
lava first of course this is the box now
this has three fluid ounces so let's
take this out now this shade is called
who needs clothes I'm fucking living for
that name by the way
BAM look at how big this bottle is now
- the Fenty foundation you can tell
there is a definite size comparison if
this looks like my ex this looks like
Nathan as we can see Rihanna is a size
Queen just like me and she was not
playing when she was giving us a lot of
product in this illuminizer so what is
the body lava
supposed to do well first of all the
packaging let's just talk about that
it's glass it feels heavy it feels good
it's solid it's amazing of course I love
all the rose gold accents on everything
the packaging is very out-there and I
love that it says that this is a silky
sublime shimmer dewy ultra lit finish
now when you go online this retails for
a whopping $59 I was like but it is
glass and it is a lot of products so
you're definitely getting your money's
worth now there are two shades the other
shade is called brown sugar and it is a
more lustrous darker bronze shade this
is a more peachy shade this is a gel
based body illuminizer made to veil skin
in a gloriously dewy high shine finish
for sunlit radiance any time you please
this is basically gonna give us a glow
year-round and you can put it anywhere
your cheekbones at your whole body it
says that there are micro pearls blended
in here with a sheer tenth of color to
accentuate all skin tones for a silky
sinus coos you guys sorry mom was high
it's gonna give us a sun-soaked sheen
any time of the year
all right so let's dive in here first of
all it also says that it has an
addictive floral vanilla scent which I
live for
of course spent a beauty is 100% cruelty
free and let's see if we can apply this
right now all right so you know I had to
get the makeup brush as well now this is
a face and body kabuki brush it looks
like this with the chrome and the baby
pink rose bristles I'm sure this is a
synthetic it definitely feels like it
but it feels like a soft synthetic not
rough or cheap it definitely feels
really nice all right so the box says it
is a custom angled design for face and
body effortless blending for liquid and
powder formulas okay now this brush
retails for $34 and of course it is
forever
it's for the highlighting products
obviously and let's get this started
let's try it out you guys so let's turn
this way let's channel our Rihanna we're
gonna take off the lid and get this pump
right here no Breanna used a lot and I'm
gonna use a lot because I'm a
highlighting queen so first of all
before we even use the brush I got a
touch with you guys let's touch it for a
second we have to oh wow it's like oily
okay oh bitch I'm hungry whoa oh my god
that is yummy
okay I'm gonna rub this on my hand real
quickly oh it looks high shine okay see
there it is on my hand rubbing it in
okay oh wow it's definitely like very
oil-based it's like sleek okay let's do
the brush first because that's what
we're here for
let's turn to the side and let's see
what happens everybody wow it's
glistening now the brush works very
quickly as you see it is synthetic so
it's really not gonna soak up their
product is gonna move it around nice and
quickly so let's just move it up top so
there's how it looks now of course I am
in the studio so we will go outside in a
minute and see how this looks with pure
sun shining on my body but for now this
is how it looks in the studio now you
guys know I like to turn on my phone and
turn on the flashlight so let's see what
this looks like oh girl look at that
shine bright like my bus let's do a few
more pumps shall we let's do let's just
cover Michelle Pfeiffer what's up
Catwoman yes girl
how about right in the mouth girl I love
it okay so let's put it all over our
bodies oh wow
it's like so satisfying to watch it
blend out okay Wow well that went on
very easy let me stand up a little bit
you can definitely see the shine right
away okay Wow now I'm gonna put on a
little more I notice it's kind of hard
to do because I can't see myself but go
big or go home right I have a mirror duh
you can definitely see it covering over
my tattoos it looks a very luminous it
is definitely pretty like mmm
oh girl look I just want to coat my
whole body in this do you think Nate
will do it
coating my entire body in body lava all
right you guys Wow okay so you can
definitely see it has that silic type of
look it is very glistening and it looks
really pretty now I don't know how it
feels yet let's let it dry for a minute
and then we'll see how it feels so let's
put the cap on back for a second and now
let's move on to the ferry bomb BAM
here is the ferry bomb this is a
glittering pom-pom and the packaging
looks like this I love it it's very BAM
now this says it is a plush shimmer
packed puff instant body glitz alright
so let's open it it comes with the
sleeve thing on it okay it looks like
that now it does of course come sealed I
already took my nail in a way so let's
open this up oh wow alright so once you
pull it off the puff is already like BAM
it's there wow it smells amazing okay so
here is what it looks like now let's
pull it out I just have this little
moment here so there's no that's a big
look at you compared to my face mm-hmm
it's more like a tea bag right now I'm
like okay so let's go on the website and
see what this is supposed to do okay
this is an oversized glittery puff pari
packed with superfine 3d rose gold
shimmer designed for dabbing directly
all over the body how do we do how do we
apply this let's see this shade is
called a rose a on ice but this is
smelling like a vanilla coconut it says
and we're just gonna put this on this
side of the body and then we'll see I
don't think you're supposed to layer it
does not say put over this so we're just
gonna try it by itself so let's just
take it I don't know how much shimmer is
supposed to come out let's just try my
hand first I guess and let's just see
what happens you guys I'm like are you
supposed to hit yourself is it you're
supposed to like shimmy all over oh okay
I see it I definitely see it alright
some it says to dab it all over we're
dabbing and what's really light like
it's very its sheer I think it's cheered
all right let's look I did a lot on my
arm so let's do the flashlight test it
might be really hard to see in the
studio you guys we will step outside in
a second bye
okay look we're gonna zoom in on my hand
it's definitely there it's just a little
more sheer than I guess I thought it was
gonna be I don't know what to expect but
yeah it's definitely there it's just
it's sheer so let's take the puffs again
and let's
oh yeah it's really share compared to
the body lava it is definitely shake
away shear so let's take this all right
so we're gonna zoom in on the tattoos
you can definitely tell that it's a you
know waiting more fainter than the other
one but it is pretty it smells really
good I think I'm just fucking hungry and
have the munchies
alright I'm gonna put on a little bit
more because I really want us to get the
full effect when we go outside you just
definitely have to like do another layer
and pack it on I think so let's do that
okay it's showing up more now maybe it
also has to be activated you guys like
it's been sitting in its box for a
second it needs to like have its moment
there we go alright so we will do that
there is that and then this arm over
here is looking bare guys I can't stop
body lava alright my arms are completely
covered wow it definitely has like that
wet look now I have not touched my chest
yet my fingers are clean since we just
applied the fairy balm over here I want
to touch and see how the body lava is
doing so it's been about five minutes
and let's see oh wow
it is sticky like definitely came off
and it feels really tacky like something
would definitely stick to my skin like
quickly you know what I mean so okay
we'll give it another five minutes to
see how it feels but let's go outside
and see what this looks like in the
daylight right you guys I'm in the
direct Sun it's a little hard to open up
my eyes but I want you guys to see the
real accuracy of this review so excuse
my star shadow but here is the body lava
all right here Wow it's definitely wet
looking it's very BAM and let's turn you
can see my arm oh wow
that looks crazy on tattoos it looks so
stunning Wow
so let's turn my body over here to the
fairy bomb now I'm actually a little
shocked and shook because why does this
look so pretty in the daylight but in
the studio it was a little diffused and
I was like where is it outside I'm like
oh hello
it's like very pretty it's very shimmery
I'm actually gonna take some right now
and do a little more so I'm just gonna
dab a little bit
Wow you can see the glitter particles in
the sunlight and it looks really really
pretty I'm like wow definitely shocked
because I was a little unimpressed in
the studio but now that I'm out here I'm
like bitch okay now the only thing is
this has been on for about 20 minutes
now you guys and it is really tacky like
sticky so let's go inside and give our
final thoughts but you guys what do we
think so far I'm like damn let's give
our final thoughts on this review so
going outside definitely change my mind
about the fairy bomb at first I was like
girl but outside it was like oh like
definitely could see it so when you're
in front of a bunch of beauty lights
sometimes things can look a little
different so I'm glad I went outside
it's still yeah in the studio the
glitter is not like really really
powerful even with the light I wasn't
living and breathing for it but outside
it is stunning so if you're about to go
to a pool party if you got to lay out
and just smoke lying on the beach it's
it's a moment alright now let's talk
about the body lava
oh hey Oh perfect okay you guys naked
mirror he has no idea what's happening
alright so I'm reviewing the new Rihanna
stuff oh yeah I'll skit over you good
all right so only thing I'm about to get
my final thoughts no this wasn't was
really cute look at this smell it hmm it
smells pretty good
I see your hand - the glitter is really
fine oh wow yeah - light test this
sparkles - sparkles okay so anyway this
one is what we're about to do the final
thoughts on and to me touch my chest and
tell me how you'd feel if you're hugging
me if that was covering me oh wow
what does it feel like to you that's
like really sticky it's really sticky
huh
so that's my only complaint like I just
can't do that like hold on the scandal
yeah so if you're gonna go outside and
do a photo shoot or just not have any
guy touch you this would definitely be a
very cute Luminizer here touch the touch
Catwoman but it's really sticky so I
couldn't imagine trying to lay next to
Nathan or like rub on him because it
would like be kind of you can imagine
what that would feel like once it gets
wet either if you were
jump in the water or something oh I bet
you would get like super their hand like
what's gonna be kind of here like touch
me for a second oh yeah your hands wet
oh yeah it's all over uh-huh so to me I
love the effect it looks so stunning
I couldn't imagine covering myself with
it and then going to the beach like I
think sand would just oh yeah you it'll
you'd get covered in sand
yeah so definitely good for Instagram
pictures and if you're just living your
life and at the poolside not near any
sand or dirt all right baby love you
mm-hmm you know where liquid lit men are
not into that lip gloss all right so the
final verdict is the fenty beauty fairy
bomb definitely really cute I liked it a
lot you guys know I was a little nervous
at first but it is really pretty I want
to put this over and we can't because
what if it gets might get wet on here
and I don't want I don't want to ruin it
it smells so pretty I'm like hi moving
on the face and body brush it was cute I
don't personally use brushes that come
with products I think we already own so
many brushes it's like come on girl but
brands always do that so it's definitely
a cute accessory for someone that likes
to collect definitely love putting
little brushes on my vanity the brush
worked it was great did an amazing job
and bam like a I am glistening all right
so the body lava you guys I'm on the
fence I'm not sure about it only because
of how it doesn't dry down I think it
just feels a little too tacky for my
taste so I will not be wearing this if
I'm going to the beach but if I'm just
going to the pool and hanging out I will
get my chest a little moment so I'm on
the fence you guys what do you think all
right so the Fenty beauty face and body
kabuki brush and the fairy bomb are
jeffree star approved but I am a little
guys I don't want to disapprove this
because it looks amazing on the skin but
with how it dried down I cannot say I a
hundred percent live for it myself but I
want you guys to sound off below so
we're not gonna disapprove and we're not
gonna approve so for now it is gonna
stay in the middle and I want to hear
what you guys think what type of formula
do you guys love and what would you wear
or would you even wear it so besides
that you guys fancy beauty is on a roll
from packaging to aesthetic to how they
present the new products I am living for
and I cannot wait to see what is next
are you guys thank you for watching this
review I will see you on the next one
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
