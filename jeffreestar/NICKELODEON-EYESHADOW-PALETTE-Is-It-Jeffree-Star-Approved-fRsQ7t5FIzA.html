channel hi how the hell are you doing
alright today we're gonna dive into a
brand new eyeshadow palette I gotta show
it off right away so first of all today
was not planned I was gonna film
something totally different
I was about to mix 25 foundations
primers and concealers and fuck up my
whole face do we still want to see that
video let me know but besides that I was
sitting down to film and Nate pops into
my filming room and he goes baby I found
something that you need to review that
you don't know about and I was like what
your dick and he goes BAM and he hands
me this palette and I was like
Nickelodeon first of all I am a 90s baby
I grew up literally watching Rugrats
every morning before school I was
addicted to cartoons I loved Nickelodeon
like this is such a nostalgic moment for
me I'm staring at this like holy shit so
when Nate handed me this I was like okay
mr. reviewer you found something that I
have never heard of I didn't even know
this existed so today we're going to be
reviewing the Nickelodeon 90s nostalgic
eyeshadow palette I made that up it's
just called the Nickelodeon palette I
want to see what the Realty is so if you
guys want to see if the Nickelodeon
eyeshadow palette is Jeffrey star
approved then keep on watching so this
palette it's pretty big actually for
what it is I'm not mad at it at all this
comes with ten eyeshadows now this does
say that it is made in China so it's
either gonna be really great or really
bad
now this palette retails for sixteen
dollars and ninety cents
that is such a random number each pan
has it says two grams / 0.07 ounces per
unit oh maybe that's like the tire
that's the entire thing so it says
directions external use only keep out of
reach from children okay girl now the
ingredients are very minimal it's like
talcum mica mineral oil and a few things
that you create to make eye shadow to me
there has to be more ingredients it
feels a little weird having literally 1
2 3 4 5 6 ingredients to create all this
shit the palette does come saran wrap
only right here which I find very weird
but it lets you open it and see inside
so it does come protected I mean I guess
it does make sense but the fact that
other people can just open it it's kind
of weird for sanitary reasons
but hey so what do you open it you see
all the cartoons we got Ren and Stimpy
we got Rugrats there's just so many
iconic moments like I oh my god this is
so cool it looks to me oh my god that is
so cute all of the shade names represent
parts of different shows which i think
is really cute it also comes with this
brush girl that brush looks sodium cheap
I am done but let's open it we don't
wanna be too judgmental now first of all
I think that the packaging is amazing I
love the orange I love all the cartoons
besides that I think it's time to open
this up how do we do that
let's just that easy Oh wallah of course
we saw this is protecting it BAM oh and
it has another protector which I do like
okay I'm not mad at that okay so we do
have two protectors now the brush you
guys well or jesus take the wheel I wish
you can reach them to the screen right
now and feel this okay look at this
brush you guys oh okay sorry that this
brush feels so cheap it's almost like it
didn't need a brush or if you're gonna
make one make a better synthetic this
literally feels worse than like a
child's paint brush it like Ojai hurts
like girl that we're gonna use this
brush for one color just to see I have
to see why they even included this okay
moving on from that we got to see if the
shadows are pigmented do they blend are
they amazing let's find out
alright now I will say this the pen size
is massive I'm gonna take out this
little mac eye shadow I have bitch they
come in from me they got like beauty
killer size pans up in here so I love
the shape of the pan it's very cartoon
and very Nickelodeon so cute I don't Ram
bling we're gonna dive into this palette
and I think the first shade that we're
gonna do right here it's called
Oh fish sticks now I think it's fair to
lay down some primer I do that with
every video obviously so we're gonna go
in with the Mac painterly primer of
course one of my go-to s and we're just
gonna take a little she's getting low
we're just gonna take a little Mac
synthetic brush and apply some primer
right to the lid right there because
baby we need to prime our lives alright
now that we're primed we're gonna take
the same brush and dip in here - oh fish
sticks let's see a little 1 2 3 oh my
god bitch there's zero follow you better
work
loading in okay Wow I'm gonna go shook
alright let's put this on the lid and
see if we have any pigment so I guess
let's see what happens
oh okay
alright that actually worked I had no
idea what to expect you guys I'm like
what the hell
first of all this shade actually works
amazing alright so looking on the back
of this it says that Viacom of course
who owns Nickelodeon did license is out
but it says that tastes beauty LLC which
is a New York company now I googled them
and they do a lot of manufacturing for
random stuffs there was like ice cream
companies and all this stuff so this
company does put out a lot of beauty
random products for other companies so
who knows if the rest of the shades are
gonna be poppin but so far this one is
not bad so let me just finish this on
this side and let's see if the other
colors work now we're gonna take a
little Gucci eyeshadow blending brush
and we are going to dip into shade hi ho
diggity it is this macaroni and cheese
orange right here and let's see oh that
one has a lot more fall out
not bad but look at the brush baby it is
coated I just want like dipping again
and have to stop okay
now let's see how this is gonna look
we're just gonna pop this right into our
crease let's be really dramatic here we
have no eyebrows we're just trying to
live we're just trying to survive on
this planet oh my god pigment what the
hell okay orange I am not mad at this at
all now it's blending nicely with that
kind of like topi white shade oh fish
sticks so I'm just gonna be really
dramatic and take this all the way in
and just leave space on my lid for
something else
maybe we'll buff in some of that pink I
love a pink and orange moment so the
only thing I'm seeing is as I'm blending
out it's not like sticking fully if you
guys can see what I'm seeing like it's
not bad it's just kind of getting a
little blending some more and see what
happens
not too bad I'm sure I see if the
shadows are mixing well together I am
gonna take this we're barely dip into
that and we're just gonna go right over
that orange let's soften her all right
we're looking range we are definitely
fully orange okay you guys the only
thing I'm noticing is that when you're
blending these out they're a little low
quality in the sense that like that's
gonna be a little tricky because my
lighting is crazy but you still this is
really dark here and when you try to
blend up it doesn't blend the best but
it's not that
video cuz I'm blending my life away and
I'm making it work it's just a little
more difficult than normal but hey it's
not bad okay moving on now I was
thinking of dipping into coffees just so
many options I mean look we have full
orange you guys it's like pink sand and
probably this one let's try this one
this is called all dolled up the very
pink so let's see if that one wants to
work and maybe I'm just gonna pack that
on my whole lid maybe know that maybe
let's just put it right in there I
wasn't sure what kind of formula this is
it appears to be like a metallic but I
guess we shall see all right so let's
just a little off it'll most of it came
off now let's just place that right in
here and let's see what happens is it
April Fool's because where the hell is
the pig man the orange one was like holy
shit this one okay y'all see what I'm
saying hmm okay and look at the mess
this pink one made just for the record
girl I'm blowing on my palate I'm gonna
try thy finger literally which I hardly
ever do but with world Shadows I've been
doing that more and more now that I have
short nails it's a lot easier okay this
is almost bunching up on my finger but
let's just press it near my lid and
let's see what happens
okay so although the is flopping not
living for that shimmer shade at all I'm
kind of offended like it's a pink shadow
I was like this is the one let's pop it
over here to make it even
okay this brush is working slightly
better but not really okay we are going
in with our finger one more time right
in your guys like it looks cute for a
second and that cock evaporates like did
Houdini make this palette and they
didn't label him as the creative
director all right I got a dip into
another shimmer shade the shade is
called I'm beautiful and I swear to God
if there's no pigment first of all I'm
no highlighter on I feel naked I feel
ugly I feel disgusting okay for real
though let's try our drivers of the
highlighter does that pink one was so
offensive my brain can't compete what's
happening okay we're gonna go in with
this little anasazi a highlighting brush
and let's go in with I'm nude okay I
mean I'm not mad at this as a
highlighter baby oh she looks cute
Nickelodeon you better get that fucking
glow all right so I'm finessing this
into the skin it looks a little chalky
in person but not that bad like I would
probably wear this over the fallout on
this one my whole nose is like a disco
ball Jesus well we're getting through it
I think the highlights kind of pretty
it's like streaking out like didn't
stick to my face that is so weird so I
think we should dive into another matte
shade I want to try this one you idiot
right here with that's cute
sorry I need to fall out y'all alright
let's grab a little brush right here and
we're gonna dive into the dark burgundy
you idiot so we're gonna take this color
and put it in the crease where that pink
should have stayed and it let me down
um okay I mean the matte shades cute not
tested on animals I was seeing if this
formula is vegan it might be there's no
carmine or anything to make the red
shades like work better but there's also
no red dyes some confused of how they
made this color but regardless it's
working a little bit better than that
pink one because oh my god that mm-hmm
all right you guys oh it looks pretty
from far away but once you get closer
its oh it's a little messy okay let's
keep moving on in trying a few more
shades I think I want to try to put in
some sort of color right in there I mean
I would probably keep it really light
and white but we do need to try out some
more shades now this blue one is
speaking in my name but blue and orange
we all know I'm scared the test is
purple you guys I gotta be honest I'm so
scared of these shimmer shades like I
got a touch one let's try it okay that
looks pretty there but maybe it's cuz of
my finger sometimes you guys when you
swatch things with your fingers they can
look great and on the lid they look
awful or vice versa like I'm not that
mad about it but it just feels a little
thin like sheer I guess like it kind of
looks opaque and then when it settles
it's like yeah I just want to try this
stunning green one it's called a rawr
and it looks actually have glitter in it
where the other ones don't this one is
beaut if we zoom in here you can
actually see the glitter so I'm gonna
take this clean finger right here let's
go right here
oh okay let's try this
I'm not doing this you guys we're gonna
zoom in right here on this finger this
is what's going on right now now I know
trust me even some of my shadows when
you swatch them with your finger they
can look a little weird because it
really meant for brush isn't on your lid
I get that so I'm gonna try this but I
was very show and how that looked I'm
like oh all righty so we're gonna take a
little Tom Ford blending brush and let's
first of all try this because maybe this
needs a brush so let's go in let's see
what this looks like on okay let's try
that again I'm digging in this fucking
pan right here you guys digging okay
let's try it again hmm my powder brush
really blended that out okay we're gonna
scratch another shade first of all since
I'm just on a roll we got to try out
this stunning brush that came with the
palette I think we should use a matte
shade or maybe only we're kind of
running out of matte shades besides this
blue one you guys that's it we've used
this one this one and that one and the
rest of them are all shimmers which I'm
a little shocked at the shimmers I gotta
be honest okay that's going with this
one this is called we loves me okay and
let's go in with that oh the brush maybe
holds a little bit of pigment okay girl
let's see what happens
I mean just with the brush it actually
shows up better than that green one I'm
kind of shocked let's go in with the
finger okay we're gonna go in right
there
okay I mean this review is a little
shocking we're gonna go in a little bit
more with the finger on the lid huh did
that invisible bitch from Fantastic Four
create this alright you guys I think I'm
ready to give my final thoughts but I am
dying to try this blue and I feel like
if I don't try it you guys might hurt me
so let's go in here there's this shimmer
has rained down everything it's like
girl oh okay so the blue looks to be
like we might have some pigment here of
course there's a little bit of kickback
but not like anything crazy now I'm
gonna take this blue and I'm gonna put
it under what's through this side cuz
that green is just offensive and let's
just see what happens okay I mean
something
I mean at least there's pigment on this
one right alright we're just gonna put
this blue right over that green I'm
having a rough time and I normally don't
say that and lest the cameras off and
I'm in bed but fuck man this is just oh
I was gonna do lashes I was gonna do a
liner I was gonna do mascara now I just
want to go home and cry so I thought you
guys let's give our final thoughts okay
I didn't expect this I did not expect
this outcome alright let's just break it
down the nickelodeon eyeshadow palette i
had high hopes baby for $16.90 i said
girl this formula is gonna work it's
gonna be sickening it probably should
have been like ten dollars or eight
dollars now the packaging is literally
ten out of ten like bit killed it looks
like a cassette it's fucking cool there
is cartoons everywhere at the orange
background of the pallet below um behind
the shadows is amazing everything is
really cool aesthetically wooden eight
gave me this I was like oh my god
gagging living breathing deceased
cremated quaking shaking you know the
drill but after playing with this I
realized that they maybe should have
done an all matte palette the matte
shades for the most part we're great
obviously the blue the blue looks cute
on camera I'm looking in the monitor but
overall it's not like rich in pigment
like to me it still looks a little like
Airy or faded or if you were to touch it
Oh actually doesn't really come off it's
kind of shocking I'm like let me try to
rub it away
barely it's just not like rich it's just
not as pigmented as I would have loved
now the shimmer shades metallic shimmer
frost whatever they're calling it
they're a flop they're not good at all
the fallout was extreme I think this is
kind of cute for a highlight but it just
went everywhere it's like all over my
lap all over my face whoo it was rough
this pink one get it I'm offended Pink's
my favorite color I'm offended the
orange and that one were probably my
favorites the orange is actually really
cute the more that the orange is on I
don't mind it at all
I think that you idiot was really cute
the
dark kind of wine color but everything
else oh I just can not so I pause the
video and I said where did Nate buy this
and he goes oh I bought at Hot Topic
at the mall in Topanga and I was like
baby Hot Topic is selling this I know
the Hot Topic has a make up it is very
lackluster but I had high hopes for this
I thought maybe Hot Topic would find any
lab or something and mmm I'm highly
disappointed I'm such a 90s I mean I am
a 90's kid I love the collodion
so much but I'm speechless - guys I'm
like trying to find something nice to
say it I just can't when you guys saw
the shadows perform it was bad so I do
have to say that the Nickelodeon
eyeshadow palette is not jeffree star
approved like literally a Maybelline
palette or an elf eyeshadow palette from
the drugstore had better pigmentation
and payoff than this I think the mats
were great like I said but there's only
four mats and I'm like I can't even
count I'm so shook there's seven out of
ten shimmers so I think that should have
went the other way
and whoever made this and if you're
watching this please work on the
metallic formula cos girl I can't
believe you even approved that to put
this in here but alright you guys
actually a lot of fun trying this I love
just staring at this I think it looks so
cute is it worth $16.90 no it ain't
well over that price point I can't I'm
done all right you guys I'm sad I'm
actually sad I'm really upset that
doesn't work this one's going in the
drawer oh my voice just cracked I'm
upset alright you guys thank you for
watching today's review I gotta put my
hood on I'm sad I don't like it
alright well I'm gonna go uh smoke away
my sorrows and I will see you on the
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
