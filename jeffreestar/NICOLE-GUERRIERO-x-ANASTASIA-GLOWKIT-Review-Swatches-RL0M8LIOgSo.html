channel today I'm really excited because
we are about to turn up a glow well I
think we are and today I will be
reviewing and doing a little first
impressions on the new anastasia beverly
hills nicole guerrero collaboration
now they teamed up and combine forces
and they create a glow kit now what does
that mean if you've never heard about
Sophie before which you must be living
under a bridge if you've never heard of
her or her brand but they make amazing
amazing highlighters and of course you
guys know I've used this brand on my
channel a million times cannot go a day
without using the dipbrow for my
eyebrows and they're just an amazing
brand all around but of course we are
going to test this we're going to swatch
it we're going to put it on my face and
we're going to see if this is Geoffrey
star approved I've never personally met
Nicole Guerrero myself but I know that
she has been a beauty youtuber and a
lifestyle like blogger for a minute and
I really like her videos this is really
amazing series on her channel where
she's in the car talking almost like a
confessional type of thing and she also
does really dope makeup so if you guys
want to see me swatch and dip into this
palette and then keep on watching so the
palette has a slipcover that comes off
whoa BAM now on the back of both of them
it has all the information so I did a
little research on this myself and I
found out that this product will be $40
and I know that it's launching on their
website and I think Sephora on March 3rd
and I think it's in stores on March 15th
so if you're not an online shopper which
who the hell is not an online shopper
girl then you try to go in stores the
pick this baby up
so this palette comes with six gorgeous
shades these are all metallic
highlighters of course now the normal
Glo kits I think it's the same weight
for everything but these are actually
six circles and I know the how it's very
sometimes or squares hands sometimes
there's only four so this one comes with
six which I'm like oh okay be sure to do
a collaboration we're going to do a
motherfucking collaboration now right
off the bat you guys kitty cat and
forever lit I am dying to like mix them
together on my cheekbones it's like
speaking to me the net weight is 4.5
grams which is 0.16 ounces each which is
a really nice amount of product and also
I want to note that this palette is
vegan and it is cruelty-free haller
and i guess let's just dive into some
swatches you guys now I'm going to flex
them on my finger than on my arm and
then I'm going to test out some on my
cheeks and we're just gonna glow so I
think let's dive into this and let's do
some punches alright so you see the pans
are untouched I have not even swatch
them with my fingers yet which we will
do in a minute but I do want to rub a
few of my cheeks and see how much the
glow is if they're good or not how the
formula works on my face I really want
to try kitty cat purrs I think it is
such unique shade it looks like a peachy
like I don't know it's like a peachy
warm vibe I'm living for it and I see
that sparkle I'm addicted to the sparkle
so I'm going to use the Anasazi at
Beverly Hills a 23 brush you want to
pack on the highlight and you want to be
in from outer space then this is for you
so I am just going to take the brush and
first of all let's do a pigment too this
is with a bull swirl oh you want to see
that pigment okay there's really no
fallout which is amazing just twirling
it around
it didn't go everywhere which I
appreciate let's go on these cheekbones
and see what happens
Oh oh my god holy oh it almost looks wet
it's so beautiful I'm sitting you're
like oh okay oh my god okay I'm adding
one more you guys thought that was it
I'm sorry I'm like contour what I really
need Khan for today like this is okay
mom is a little shocked and shocked I am
choking what does that mean I am shocked
and shaken off as I'm dying
okay I'm gonna add on a little bit more
because you know this visual like the
real severe blow it goes on instantly
there's not a lot of fallout so my nose
is not covered in glitter it's not
chalky thank God I do not like chalky
highlighters I'm claiming you guys it is
alike and this looks like wet metal it's
kind of just dripped down my face wow
this is beautiful okay well I want to
try to defecate on my cheek and then I
want to put a note on top
because you think one highlight isn't
enough so this color right here daydream
is basically like it looks like an
orange highlighter which i think is
really unique and really fun I've never
really seen a color like this done so
anything unique you know I'm all about
so I also have you know I have expire
these brushes before the record so this
brush is clean as you can see and I am
just going to dab into there I'm a
little scared of orange like I don't
really wear orange I am a very cool tone
today I have on warm toned contour and
warm tone eyes so let's see what this
looks like whoa okay I'm going in for
the second time
whoa you guys I don't think and I'm
gonna say this on the record I don't
think I've ever worn a highlighter this
shade before it is really different it's
almost like a sun rise on your cheekbone
now to me this shade daydream is not as
blinding as kitty cat
but it's still blinding like it's all
like oh it's subtle it's there it's
really there I think it mesh really well
with my contour so I do want to note
that when I did dip into daydream it was
a little more fall out but high if the
highlighter is powder things are going
to have some fallout some time so I
don't really think that's the negative
I'm one of those people that just goes
like this next now before I do any
swatches on my hand I do want to take a
clean brush we'll take this little fan
brush and I want to dip into the shade
forever lit now I hope my lights are
doing the shade justice because forever
lit is like this beautiful icy white
tone but it has this reflex pearl almost
like a baby blue lavender
so let's dip into her and see what
happens I'm going to coat this brush
okay you guys thought we thought this
glow is crazy
wait could we add this bhishan
oh holy shit when I tell you the watts
of the glower fucking turned up
I read your lips I'd turn a little if
you will
Wow those two together though okay I
think I know what might go true summer
looks going to be from for a minute
let's keep it really real here
all right this side I think I want to
add on another color because why not I
mean honestly
now this shade glow get it right here it
looks to be a really pretty golden
highlighter so I am going to take this
fan brush BAM and I'm going to dip into
her and then we're going to layer it
just a tiny bit on top of the paid Reem
oh wait a minute
these two though these two though you
guys didn't go home or what these
combinations though if you're someone
that just like one highlighter I want
you to please do me a favor next time
you get ready add on two maybe three if
you're feeling daring but at least try
to because I think mixing and matching
colors like it turns out like I still
can't get over this it just turns out
amazing alright now if you want to take
a brush and I want to do a little bit of
brow highlight because we can not we
can't just not do the brow highlight now
I'm going to take kitty cat one more
time with this little morphine detailer
brush and I just want to put this right
under my brow bone and see what happens
so that's how that already made my brow
look a little lifted I'm like oh okay
wow the reflex on that is really
stunning I'm not over it okay a little
more
now this straight up here forever young
I haven't dipped into it yet it looks
like a almost like a champagne warm tone
color what kind of some silver I see in
there so let me just put this below the
brow see how it looks
the reflex on this one not that any
other previous blow kids were like you
know subdued or anything but I feel like
they really turned up the glow for this
palette I'm like I can't get over this
I'm like huh alright I think it's only
fair that we do the Cupid's bow because
you guys know that is the jeffree star
staple so I think I'm going to go in
with forever lit you know to look tiny
bit right here hmm
even a little maybe on it you know keep
its bow and the lip uh-huh oh my god
look at the highlighter over this length
it's like Barbie is having a moment I
think I'm going to do some swatches on
my hand just so we can see all the
colors right here and I mean we tested
up the face I'm I can't get over and I'm
like wow okay my life might break my
camera is like what in the hell is going
on so I'm going to take this palette you
guys and I'm just going to swatch them
with my fingers as well and just put
them on my hand because I didn't try out
the shade 1:43 I think it's a little too
dark for me I'm a pasty ass bitch so
maybe I can use this for on the lid
obviously highlighters can be used for
eyeshadow for the inner corner so I'm
doesn't going to be using this in you
know in the future for smokey eyes but
right now momma's we don't test them on
their fingers all right this is shade
kitty cat such a gorgeous color I'm
looking on over it and then here is
shade Forever Young and then here is
that beautiful orange daydream oh yes
and then we have the lightest shade
forever lit the reflex on this we'll
know is like in saying off-the-charts
I'm like holy shit and then we have the
fifth shade which is glow get er that
beautiful gold we'll just going to put
this one right here ma'am and then here
is the final shade it is like a
beautiful more dark toned gold and oh
yes so here are all six of the shade
swatch on my hand I really don't know if
I have a favorite yeah I really think
that forever
lych and kitty cat are I think the
winners for me I'm obsessed with this
combination I'm kind of in love that you
guys not gonna lie so obviously this is
going to be no shock to anybody but the
honest sake of Beverly Hills the cult
Guerrero glow kick it's Geoffrey start
proof duh I mean you guys saw it
firsthand on camera it's blinding
there's no smoke and mirrors it's just
fucking sickening and I appreciate a
product that does exactly where it says
this will be my makeup kit for the next
few months and I can't wait to see what
else is brand put out next so final
thought Nicole and nor Vina
you guys fucking swag this palette so
thank you guys so much for watching this
video I hope you loved it and like Manny
says you know what the drill is I'll see
you guys in the next one
