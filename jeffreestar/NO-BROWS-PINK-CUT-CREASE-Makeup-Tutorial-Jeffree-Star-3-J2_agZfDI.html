channel
oh girl I'm thirsty so for it's a
daisy tutorial we're gonna be diving
into the far deep end of the golem now
I'm I'm kind of missing being a little
extra I think I've been toning it down a
little bit lately so which was scary
territory for me but now I'm gonna turn
up the waters or glamour and I'm gonna
give you a little space-age pink crazy
winged glamazon tutorial I don't even
know what I'm gonna call this yet but
the highlight is churned up it is a very
pink very just I'm feeling it it is a
very Geoffrey start 2009 she's back and
she's feeling herself quick reminder
that we are very close to September 30th
when my lip ammunition is stick a
lipstick comes out finally today I am
wearing one of the shades called X
supermodel with a little gloss over it
but um you'll see all that in the
tutorial in a minute but um I'm just
excited for everything to finally lunch
um besides that you guys I hope everyone
has been amazing I miss you I have been
traveling a lot so I am pre filming a
few videos and I think right now when
this is uploaded I will already be in
Michigan we are visiting Nathan's family
and just doing some sightseeing some
shopping and just some just some hang
time for a minute because it's hard to
see your family when you get work so
goddamn much alright if you want to see
how I created this alien sex doll look
then keep on watching let's dive into
some glamour now I'm gonna be using a
new primer today that I found at the
Gucci store this is called the Gucci
face silk priming serum first of all
this bottle girl it's like metal it
feels really luxurious and heavy now
there's a lot of nice ingredients in
here allegedly so let's give it a whirl
I'm just gonna put this on my Beauty
Blender oh my god it looks like Tom and
I'm just going to top this all over this
face now I've already pre moisturized
with my favorite lemare softening cream
so see if we contain this alligator skin
today because I am
damaged and hurting now lately I had
been doing as so many first impressions
and trying out so much makeup especially
foundations I'm gonna wind it down a
little bit and go back to my true love's
the G or air flash I have been using
this for years one of my favorites ever
is literally like literally I can't even
speak I'm so excited it's literally like
airbrush in a can and then we're gonna
mix it with my Giorgio Armani luminous
silk foundation now I've been always
asked what shade I am if you are similar
to my skin tone I am shade number two
both of these require a little shake so
uh let's get to it all right now what
I'd love to do first is take this and
hide that new hairline I like to spray
it directly on the skin you see the
difference already I'm like yay and I'm
just gonna do the same thing and put
this on here like so and then we're just
gonna dot it around the face
you
now that we look like a mannequin let's
get to concealing now today I'm gonna be
using a concealer I have and never used
before and never off camera and never on
camera but I have been dying to get the
Tarte shaped tape concealer I have heard
so many rave reviews from everybody on
YouTube I really haven't heard a one bad
thing about it so I'm like girl let me
get on this chip so I am using shade
fair today I heard that this concealer
is like full coverage but it blends like
butter so let's see what happens once
your concealer is shaped and ready we're
just gonna use that same damp a beauty
blender to blend it out and real quickly
this is a big-ass concealer light
compared to some other brands I'm like
alright Tarte you better work all right
let's get to blending
I have to say right off the bat yes you
know I always say that this concealer
mmm it really blended fillol ously
alright so we're gonna set our under
eyes with a more foundation I'm gonna be
going in with my favorite Shivering a
white Studio Fix from Matt and again
this is gonna be really easy the same
damp the Beauty Blender but this time
we're going to flip it and use the more
triangular side and we're just gonna dip
in and press this into our skin and the
powder is going to melt and just set
those under eyes now to set the rest of
the face I'm a sick-ass bitch I'm going
in with more foundation I'm gonna be
using my Giorgio Armani a luminous silk
compact so this ties in or right with
that foundation we used earlier I'm just
going to be going in with a little more
feet II three brush this is one of my
favorites for just putting powder all
over what I'm doing is basically just
pressing in the powder into the skin
really harshly we're just going to go
around all those moments I just
highlighted but I'm not just gonna you
know go like this we're gonna press it
into the skin
for contour today I am going to be using
this Tom Ford blush in shade and
narcissist how fitting I'm really gonna
just do something a little different
today I'm not gonna do the usual Brown
everywhere we're just gonna have a
little bit of fun today and I'm gonna be
going into my Surratt beauty contour
brush I was such a fan of their
highlighting brush I had to pick up a
few more from Sephora the price point is
a little ridiculous but being a makeup
artist I thank God for the tax
write-offs alright let's try this out
alright I'm feeling a very airbrushed
very 80s I actually used to do this all
the time you guys like 2007 and on I was
using blush for contour for years so I'm
bringing it back and if anyone wants to
join me please feel free alright so now
that these cheeks are snatched I really
don't want to contour the rest of my
face I think the focus is really going
to be on the eyes today so let's dive
into them I actually have the Liberty to
not wear eyebrows because I don't have
any so I'm just gonna do a really
dramatic fun look since we're diving
into fall I'm gonna get really neon and
really deadly
so for eyes today I am going to be a
using my busy art palette I love this
one this is the editorial one so I am
going to actually just prime these lids
because we're going crazy today and I'm
gonna be using that Urban Decay shadow
primer potion then we're just gonna dot
this on the lid
so I am going to dip into one of my
favorite matte white shadows ever
invented come through a busy art and
we're just going to press this all over
the lid this is really going to make
these neon shadows pop and I'm going to
take that and press it all the way in my
inner corner
come on bone structure the get started
with these eyes they're slightly
complicated so we're going to be going
in with that jeffree star cosmetics
beauty killer palette and we're gonna be
using shade star power today and I'm
going to be using a little blending
brush from sugarpill so we're just going
to kind of outline our lids and cut out
a little moment of what we're gonna do
so you see where my kind of eye goes
right there where that crease is we are
going to add a lot of darkness in there
but for now we are going to start by
adding in the hot pink
we're gonna do a cleanup with concealer
in a second but first we are going to
take a little Bobby Brown blending brush
and dip into princess it is a really
just pretty little metallic moment and
we're gonna take it and really put it
right on top of the pink and blend it
out a lot more oh my god I'm already
living for this okay so now we're gonna
clean up the eyelids a little bit let's
put her away so these nails don't gouge
the pan so I'm gonna go in with a little
more feet II 19 brush this is a tiny
little concealer brush I'm just gonna
take a tiny amount and see what happens
just like so and we're gonna take this
and put it on the lid now we're going to
start creating some depth depth depth
and shadow and I'm going to be going
into shade of vanity with a little more
feet 5:07 brush and then we're just
gonna go right in that crease like we're
bringing the full drama today so notice
how I'm not gonna bring it all the way
down we're just gonna merely gradually
blend that in and out and then we're
gonna drag her down now I'm gonna be
going and back in with star power and
I'm just going to go over that dark a
line with some pink and now I'm gonna
keep this very open and maybe we're
gonna do glitter later I don't know what
I want to do but it's definitely time
for a wing so I'm gonna be going in with
my makeup forever ink liner and it's
just a pitch black eyeliner I love it
and the applicator is a very long and
we're just gonna go in here and see what
happens
the liner is done she's a little sharp
the little Kunti I'm feeling her we're
definitely gonna be doing huge lashes in
a minute but we got to get this bottom
part done I'm gonna be going in with my
Mac some older eyepencil what's new
right and we're just going to put this
right in the waterline all right now
we're going to go back into that beauty
color palette and we're just going to
smoke out this a bottom part I'm going
to be dipping into shade of violence
this is such a pretty shadow you guys
I'm just gonna start to buff it under
the eye and see what happens now I'm
going in with a Mac two to one a little
detail brush and I'm just gonna barely
touch the starpower and I'm just gonna
put it right under the violence shade
and just you're barely gonna notice it
but it's just gonna kind of buff it out
okay now it's definitely time for some
lashes so I'm gonna be going in first of
course with my benefit roller lash
mascara hmm all right now we're gonna
coat our entire lashes in this pitch
black mascara
all right four lashes today I'm gonna be
using the Artemis take a moment lashes
these are really pretty and why am I so
obsessed with their packaging it's like
let white leather girl okay so I'm gonna
be using some tweezers and of course you
all know how's it going with my Eschete
OA latex-free lash glue lashes are on
now it's time for some extreme highlight
today I'm going to be going in with my
Pat McGrath skin fetish in shade golden
I love this now this side has a balm
highlighter on it now I like to take my
Beauty Blender and just really go in on
there you can take this and go if you
want but sometimes it can mess with your
foundation so I'm just gonna yeah
it Who am I kidding let's just go in
strong so I'm just kind of like I'm
going over right on top of that blush
contour all right now we're gonna go in
with her own brush you better work Pat I
love this little dome I love this
because the brush just kind of goes like
this and it fits perfect and we're just
gonna go in oh jesus take the wheel
this yellow tone highlighter with this
pink I'm done I'm deceased
I'm cremated oh my god this looks
sickening since we don't have brows
today we're going to take the highlight
and we're gonna even go above that pink
while we're before you - all right now I
may be going into my upper lip area mmm
and we're gonna do a little bit on our
nose let's just go in with the finger
let's keep it real here and if someone
doesn't like your glow pop now when we
do the highlight it doesn't mask your
contour a little bit and for this look I
want this a little more defined like it
was earlier so I'm just gonna barely
touch the brush and we're just gonna
redefine that pink
oh one more time just give her a little
revision and bring her back to life
mmm there we go all right for lips today
I'm going to be going in with my lip
ammunition in shade X supermodel it is
like a cool toned nudish pink color
really gonna set the tone and finalize
this look
you could add a little gloss okay let
that little gloss now I'm gonna be going
in with a little assist Lee Fido lip
star this is like a liquid glitter for
your mouth it's really pretty by itself
if you're not feeling any makeup just
throw on some sunglasses and some lip
gloss but this is a really good topper
oh you see that already I can't breathe
and this is in shade number one called
Diamond I don't like my dog cute all
right so I think the only thing left for
this uh look is you know you know the
 drill where's my setting
spray for the final touches I'm gonna be
going in with my skin Danai via the
makeup finishing spray and this is in
the formula Bridal I think this is a
really soft Bridal look so let's see
what happens
hello hello there we go I'm Mike oh and
actually also see the makeup finishing
spray normal not Bridal I don't know
what the I am today so let's do
both oh girl that's like a
geyser I can't wait all right
this look is complete this is the final
look I'm looking the monitor like oh I
really love this um pink has just always
been my favorite thing and just growing
up I used to always do blush color for
contour I'm loving it it is a very old
school Geoffrey and I'm bringing her
back um I think we definitely all kind
of gets stuck in doing the same kind of
makeups a lot of the time so be inspired
go read through some magazines look
through Instagram find strangers and
people you've never seen and just be
inspired we're all here to create art
and have fun and I think a lot of people
just kind of recycle the same so
try something different

love you so much

sex goddess I'm sorry again it really
blended effortlessly and
