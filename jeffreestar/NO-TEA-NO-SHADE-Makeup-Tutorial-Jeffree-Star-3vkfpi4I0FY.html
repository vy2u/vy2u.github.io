crazy alien monochromatic burgundy
glitter unable to folks kind of like
this but this was definitely a no T no
shade top a look and today we are
serving it up yes so before we dive in I
just want to give you guys a little
hello a little recap a little how are
you last weekend myself and my brand did
the eye mask makeup convention out here
in Pasadena California was up it was so
just amazing beautiful unreal I teamed
up with my retailer Beauty lish and we
did a booths together I had pink furry
covered walls there's pictures
everywhere it was so cool and that was
my first time really doing a real makeup
show I've never done I maps or anything
like that or fame Expo or you know all
any of the beauty shows I've really
never done them so it was really cool to
finally do it and thanks to you guys it
was such a massive crazy success I'm
still just like shook to the core so
thank you guys so much for coming out so
right now I am in New York City and then
in a few days I am jet-setting off to
Paris where I will be at the Men's
Fashion Week and I got invited by one of
my favorite brands ever which is a balm
on size that I am really excited to just
finally start releasing new products so
I'm sure you guys have heard all over
social media the rumors are true that in
March I am finally releasing a another
eyeshadow palette and here is a little
sneak peak this is the in drogyny
palette is my version of a neutral
palette it is very its neutral but it's
also really dark it's fun it's different
and this will be revealed very soon so
stay tuned to my channel and my god told
me to open it right now but
I'm not going to do the right now so if
you guys aren't mad at me for not doing
the sneak peek and you want to see how I
created this look then keep on watching
now here's the thing I'm going to let
Jesus take the wheels because I have no
idea what look I'm about to create
obviously you guys just saw the look and
saw the look at the thumbnail but right
now I don't know what the hell I'm going
to do so I'm going to do it with two
primers today I know that's like Oh -
all right she's not playing but I just
had so many new products that has been
coming in the mail and I've bought a lot
of stuff off the for us so I'm like you
know what we're trying all this it
is January let's get rolling so I may be
going in with the glam glow ball cosmic
mask
glow moisturizer this is a brand new
from the brand you guys know I'm a glam
glow mask whore and this one it has that
signature creamsicle scent just like the
glow moisturizer that I set out last
year and then I'm also going to be going
in with the Urban Decay optical illusion
what is this the complexion primer so I
am just going to use a little bit of
that now this feels so crazy it almost
feels like it's almost like clay with it
melts in your skin so I'm just going to
put it in my t-zone area mmm looks like
a play-doh set not a bad one but it
reminds me of like childhood now I'm
going to go in with this guy and I'm
just going to swirl it around all right
now I don't know how much to use at the
stuff this is to put on all over your
face to neck so I'm going to lather it
on and my neck is covered today but I'm
still going to put a little on because
the skin that's showing needs to
moisture for foundation today we're
going to be going in with the hourglass
vanish foundation you guys know this is
some full coverage and that's what
kind of mood I'm in so I'm going to go
in with two shades because I want my
under eyes to be beaming now the cool
thing about this is it is so full
coverage you don't need a concealer you
really don't need to like this is
full coverage a little goes along I'm
also going to be going into this shade
belong and this is a really pale I love
it for the under eyes it's like come on
glow now we're going to take our
damp beauty blender and get to work
all right we are blended down and now
I'm just going to zoom in on my own face
because I want to see how those primers
did and that's really good especially if
it's full coverage foundation and want
some extra moisture to the space and I
think we achieved that
all right now I'm actually going to skip
concealers like I said these are so full
coverage I'm like oh what discoloration
I even put some on the lid you guys
notice I blend the mat in there now I'm
going to quickly take some Mac Studio
Fix in shade shivering white my all-time
favorite tail under eye highlighter and
I'm going to just use my dance Beauty
blender because powders and a wet sponge
equals heaven this literally will melt
into your face
alright now I'm going to go in with a
little Georgia or money luminous silk
foundation powder and I'm just going to
use my big fluffy linear brush I am
obsessed with this it feels so soft and
a little bit brush picks up a lot of
product I'm just going to beat my face
into submission and garetty the contour
all right now contour it today I'm going
to be going in with the Curt cosmetics
Chartist contour palette this is number
one they now have three different
versions which i think is so cool I love
this it smells like a vanilla
that's like vanilla chocolate something
amazing now I'm going to use my makeup
forever fan brush it does meet well if
you want to do a quick nose contour it's
flawless so I'm going to use this shade
mainly and dip into this slightly and
let's carve this face out now it's time
to carve out this jaw what's up
jaw how you been it's been a really good
new year so far thank you for asking I
just love a heavily contoured forehead I
don't know why it gets me off alright we
are contoured everybody now I think I
just want to dive in to highlight
because usually I like to save it after
the eyes I want my dessert now who the
hell doesn't want to see a highlight so
what are we going to do today I am going
to try something that I've never dipped
into before it is from a brand called
makeup revolution all the way from
London a lot of people have been telling
me to buy this on also calm now what I
thought was really amusing is if you
zoom in on a highlighter it looks like a
vagina I might do only one seeing this
or and that's not a bad thing I'll I'm
down for a vagina highlighter you
you know I review the real one it is
belonging by the way so I'm just going
to go in with a little more fee rose
gold at 36 brush the r36 if you will and
I could wet this with a brush but like
wash my hand is clean right let me just
do a little swipe oh I'm like what the

now we're gonna really dip in here oh
wow well let's see if this is pigmented
on the skin ooh
oh let's take it all the way to the
hairline done nothing new here now we're
going to our keepers go right now and
then I'm going to take my finger and
just put it along my nose hmm all right
bitch we are highlighted now I'm going
to do a little bit of blush because I
want a little bit of warmth to my face
it is very pale winter is in full effect
now I'm gonna do something I've actually
never used before this blush came all
the way from Japan and my friend and
youtuber J Cosette picked us up in Tokyo
and look at the packaging I'm
like why is this in America and she also
brought me this brush matching brush so
stunning you guys know I'm a stickler
for packaging this is so cool
now I actually don't know how to
pronounce the brand you guys know I'm
going to ruin it it is crazy we're gonna
put the spelling right here I have no
idea that pronounces and also in case
you guys forget every product that I use
in today's video will be down below in
the description box kind of show you the
powdering because oh look at that it
looks like a cameo brooch and it is so
beautiful and this brush though I die
so I'm just gonna put a little on there
I don't know how pigmented this is and
it's hard to tell because the brush
itself is also pink so I'm like oh I'm
just kind of lightly brush this on my
cheek bone oh my god it smells like oh
the grows like lotion it's so pretty
ah I like this cuz it's subtle it's not
like you know some blushes it's like oh
 I need to definitely take them off
but this is nice let's move on now we're
gonna do these eyes right now and I'm
going to shock you all by doing 0 brows
because guess what I shaved them off
every day and I don't
I'm on today I am feeling the alien
vibes today so I'm going to plot this
Natasha at Danone a star palette which
everyone kept telling me to review this
last year and I use it a few times but I
didn't do a review there was just I
don't know what happened you guys but
it's here now it is a stunning palette I
love this brand this is actually the
same brand that Nathan used on me when
he did my makeup last year which was so
long ago now where does time go every
 time go so the palette looks
like this I was Claire thing that says
all of the names which is cool that it
kind of stays in there because it's not
how the hell are you going to really
know them and then you flip it up and
there they are there's a bunch of mats
and the mats are really supposed to be
like non like no fall out like no
crumble which is okay we're going to see
in a minute and then these crazy ones or
like I mean I was going to touch one oh
my god they're so like bull line ding
because if I click on my hand I'm just
curious right now I'm like do I need to
put this on my cheeks to now let's
get started we're going to prime the
lids with the Mac painterly paint-pot
with a little synthetic Mac brush I'm
just going to put this all over the lid
because today we're going to dip into
some color and some glitter and some
glimmer and shimmer and we're going to
see what happens
alright I'm going to dip into this dark
kind of barfi color it's called Electra
and now this formula is supposed to be
really non powdery and I mean it's a
little powdery though it's staying in
the pan but let's see how it looks on
the skin now because I have no brow I'm
gonna really focus and do really
dramatic eyes I'm the focus of products
and go down so you're going to make your
nose look even so lender when you take
the shadow like that
all right let's go with a clean brush
there we go this is the max two to four
and I'm going to go in with this shade
it is called GA l.a.x ia I know the X
has to be silent and I'm not going to
push it so sure it's called gala X I and
I'm just going to take this on the brush
oh wow
these shades are a little more crumbly
than the matte and I'm just going to
take this and put it over that color and
just kind of blend it on the edges so it
softens it and makes it really
highlighted alright so I'm putting this
on my brow bone in hopes is it being
really blinding like my finger and maybe
you're supposed to use this with your
finger or maybe I should like dab it on
but the brush is not like killing it it
is really like really powdery I'm not
living for it but that matte shade was
great so I'm gonna try to pack a little
bit more on but this brush is not doing
the job for this alright now it's a
darken that creates a little bit we're
going to be dipping into this shade so
it's like a dark brown almost across
it's like a dark brown let's see what
look how it looks on the brush oh okay
cool and this one is called Gemma and
I'm just going to coat this brush this
is a little Chanel eyeshadow blender
brush I love this one and I'm just going
to tuck this into my crease just to
darken my socket and make it really
dramatic you know nothing new here all
right now for my lid the other day I use
these Stila they're like the Magnificent
foils I used to always use and now
they're like a liquid version and the
shade is called kitten Karma and just
watch I'm just gonna put this on my lid
you tell me what y'all think I mean are
we kidding me
it's a literally like liquid glitter
shadow I am so obsessed with this and
it's really cool to like kind of cut out
your lid as well so now it's kind of
like whew you really don't need any more
but one swipe so I'm not even gonna go
and I'm just kind of like touching up
the edges right there this is done that
was so easy and so blinding now I'm
going to take a little Mac smolder eye
pencil and put that
my waterline because I want some smokey
eyes today I'm going to go in this shade
called
Phoenix and we're just going to smoke
out the under eye with this a little bit
and let's see what happened I don't know
why but like when I'm blending this out
it looks identical to that even though
this was supposed to be lighter
definitely is lighter in the pan but
it's not really like translating how I
want it to even though the color looks
similar now that's done I really don't
mind it I'm going to kind of leave this
negative space here and I think I'm just
going to do some latches and if I can
call it a day if you want to add some
glitter under here you can now that I'm
sitting here I'm like or maybe we can do
that right now
okay let me just try little Bellatrix
I'm just kind of dip into this for a
second see what happens you'll cool it I
might pop this in my inner corner oh my
god I got and there's no pigment anymore
what in the hell maybe it's just too wet
these okay let's try that oh okay
next time use fix+ night or town Bonet
we're improvising today and I'm just
going to tuck this in here and see what
happens
oh okay these shadows work oh wow
okay I'm going to stop it right there so
it's like barely like huh now we're
going to go in with my favorite roller
lash mascara from benefit cosmetics yes
ma'am and we're just going to coat these
lashes from top to bottom
all right so actually I'm really happy
how this looks with just mascara because
it's false lashes it's going to hide the
glitter and I really want the glitter to
have a moment so false lashes are not
always a necessity even with this amount
of makeup I just kind of let my eyes
shine so I think it's time for some
lipstick what are we going to use today
I am going to go in with oh yes this is
perfect okay we're going to be using my
velour liquid lipstick in shade no tea
no shade and this is like a burgundy
plum hybrid it made into a metallic it
is so pretty so let's go at it oh I'm
sorry
hi you're going to be very monochromatic
and I'm kind of into it all right I
think okay even though this is my own
color that I created I notice oh it's so
 sure you but I am obsessed with
this color this is so perfect for winter
and even the fall is kind of behind us
we are in a dark mood still I am right
now and this just sets it off I love the
monochromatic everything is whoa all
right you guys yes now I think the
listen we need is a little setting spray
if you will I'm going to be going in
with the Armani Prima refreshing makeup
fix this is this really worked last year
like I'm kind of in love with it so give
it a little shake and let's get some
blasting this first alright now that I
am dripping I think this look is
complete alright guys I am really loving
this look I know it's a little wild a
little out there for a lot of people but
hey I'm out there and weird
aren't I so if you guys want to recreate
this look or at least try this lip out I
don't care whether it's my brand or any
other brand that has a metallic metallic
lips are just so fun and it gives your
lips a little added like dimension and
I'm loving it I'm kind of like oh hi I
am really happy with this and now I'm a
have to go out with Nikita and have a
little a night on the town a little Rose
night if you will so hopefully I don't
get abducted by aliens because they're
probably like hi can you come back to
our planet you're missing but anyway
thank you guys as always for watching
this tutorial I hope you guys had fun
with me I had a lot of fun creating it
and also what other tutorials do you
guys want to see next really soft really
subtle more dramatic more crazy
do I need to like stacks by the latches

about to so I will see you guys up next
