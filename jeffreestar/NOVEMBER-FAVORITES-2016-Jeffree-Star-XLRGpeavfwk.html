channel now
was that really stoned or did I miss my
October favorites I definitely did but I
have been traveling so much and just I'm
really overworked in the best possible
way
so I didn't do an October favourites I
am so sorry but I'm back the bitch is
back and we're gonna dive into a lot of
good stuff today we got makeup we got
skincare we got shoes we got bags and we
even got a little cameo from my new dog
daddy besides all of that October and
November have been in saying I went all
the way over to the UK and me and Manny
and Patrick all went to London and we
got to celebrate this website called
Beauty bayt.com
they are one of my official retailers
that sells over 200 American brands so
if you are a UK customer or you live in
Europe definitely shop on that website
for not just my brand but for any brands
you have a hard time finding in your
country I know America we always get a
lot of stuff that some countries don't
get so the cool thing about that website
they ship everywhere so if you don't
want to wait 10 days on any American
website you can hop on over there and
that's just me trying to help you guys I
also want to kind of mention something
that has been floating around the
internet there has just been so many
people making so many videos about
conspiracies and sponsored videos and
all this I'm like you know what
look the bitch chime in for a minute
because I just want to put it out there
for the record yes your honor
I have never posted an affiliate link
code website or anything like that ever
not but that's a bad thing I just
personally don't need to and don't have
a desire to do that now I like to be a
hundred percent honest with all of my
reviews and all the stuff that I talk
about not the people that sponsor aren't
but I just want you guys to know that no
one is ever paying me to talk about
something I just want to put it out
there that I do not make any money off
of obviously you guys know there's no
codes um I love brands that offer codes
I love morphe I love shui I love a bunch
of stuff that even my fellow friends
have codes for you guys and I think
that's awesome so here's the big
question do you my subscribers my
customers and my followers do you guys
want
they're to be jeffree star codes for
anything because right now I don't want
to I just want to keep it real with you
guys and always be honest I don't ever
want there to be one inkling in your
brain or bones that you're like was he
paid to use that I don't fly like that
um no shade to anyone else that does it
that's just not my thing but if you guys
want me to ask other companies or brands
for Jeffery code maybe we could
entertain an idea for 2017 but I'm
moving on
besides traveling a lot what do we do oh
yeah we went to London oh my god Rob
there's been so much going on you guys
my head is spinning like The Exorcist I
also went to Vegas for the SEMA car show
with West Coast Customs which was unreal
like the guy part of my brain like just
for the record I feel like I have a
female and a male brain up in this head
and they're merged together so the dude
side of me loves cars I'm a car whore
besides being a makeup or I love me some
cars so the SEMA car show was so
cool and also it was my birthday last
month shout out to all my Scorpios
November 15th whoo
I flew to New York with Nathan Manny
Nikita and my best friend Alicia we had
an amazing time and we also got to
celebrate with Marc Jacob for his
holiday party shut up - Marc Jacob UT I
love you it's been crazy so I'm glad
that you know Christmas is around the
corner I'm gonna be home for a few weeks
and then for Christmas you guys me
Nathan ends brother Zach are flying off
to Maui Hawaii I had such an unreal
beautiful time earlier this year if you
guys want to see that Hawaii video where
me and Nate travel all over the island I
will link that down below for fun but um
I love Hawaii so any my Hawaiians out
there or anyone that lives there I love
you we'll be seeing you soon now I know
a lot of you have been asking about
where is my androgyny eyeshadow palette
that I talked about way earlier this
year there was some production issues
and I really wanted the formula
bomb so that is going to come out like
before April so probably March is going
to be the final date I want the New Year
to happen and I want to really perfect
it and then I think March you guys
finally another eyeshadow palette is
coming and the colors
girl I wish I could show you a preview
but I can't right now
I'll get I'll get myself in trouble
because you guys are gonna slap me for
it coming out in a few months and I keep
getting asked about my collaboration
with morphe brushes you guys all saw
these crazy pink chrome brushes months
ago and all of you were like so I am in
talks with making it all work there was
a lot of stuff that I had going on
personally this year that I wanted to
let have its own moment so that is still
in the work so don't think it ain't
coming cuz bitch watch out for next year
but besides that you guys let's dive
into some favorites now this guy has to
be in my favorite this is my fourth
Pomeranian his name is daddy hi-low Mian
he's like what are all these lights what
are you guys doing to me daddy is a four
month old wolf sable Pomeranian shout
out to all my dog lovers out there since
I bought my home in Calabasas I
definitely wanted some more animals so
besides the stingray and the shark tank
that I want one day now I'm just kidding
I really wanted another dog and me and
Nathan have had such an amazing year
with delicious and you know of course a
diva and diamond are my oh jeez I had
them before me and Mae got together so
we felt like it was time to have another
baby so um like a lot daddy I think all
the beauty lights he's like um are we
done yet he is definitely my favorite
not just for the month of November but
for my entire world on my little baby
mmm he's like girl let me go back to
sleep so I'm gonna go um here baby I'm
gonna get him to Nate I am such a
Pomeranian lover
okay now let's Agnes the makeup all
right the first makeup item I'm going to
talk about is barium this is the Wet n
Wild highlighting gold bar it's from
their mega Glo collection now let's
recap wet and wild put out highlighters
this summer and I think there were like
oh okay people are really into this
highlighting thing yes bitch we are now
they just released their winter
collection like a few weeks ago and
listen I have been glowing to filth with
this guy and hello these are only 399 so
you can find them on their website I
know they haven't met all the drugstores
I got mine at Walgreens so
get in the car and go check this
out because it is affordable and it also
works all right now let's dive into my
favorite foundation for the last month
oh my god you guys when I say that I
think I might have found my new favorite
foundation which is scary because I I
said that way earlier this year and I've
been using the same kind of like
over and over now I've tried a million
foundations this year and this one came
out about a month ago it is called the
soft fluid long wear foundation it is
from my favorite skincare brand lemare
they also dive into makeup and they
reformulated their foundation it just
released and I am I'm hooked let's just
say that for some reason this it's
medium triple coverage but when you
apply it with a Beauty Blender it just
like looks really skin light but it
gives you that mannequin doll look that
I am very well known for looking like
but it doesn't make it look cakey a lot
of the times like trust me I like a full
mask a lot of the times it can look kind
of cakey like later on throughout the
day but this one mmm girl mmm ah it
looks like real skin it's like Barbie
skin I know I have said that in the past
before but this one is like oh really
amazing it fills in the fine lines it
fills in the pores and it just looks
sickening so now of course the price tag
for this one is a little hefty it's
about $100 so if you're like girl you
got the wrong one I would go to a store
like sex with a veneer or Neiman's and
just get a sample just try it out I
think that you know these bottles are
big I've been using mine for alum me so
I think it's like on week 4 now and it's
like right here only of how much I've
used so I think that foundations are an
investment if you want to look
flawless of course there's obviously a
million other alternatives this just
personally it works for me and I'm
obsessed all right so my next favorite
is I'm gonna be a shameless
whore right now and talk about my own
velour at liquid lip Holiday Collection
now these came out on Black Friday and
oh my god I just like like it takes me a
lot to get emotional and I was blown
away at how hard you guys came on Black
Friday and Cyber Monday and
our weekend it was so surreal I
definitely had a few moments where I
cried at my house happy tears not of
course sad but like I was crying happy
tears of joy because you know it was
crazy only two years ago I started my
brand and I was celebrating the two-year
anniversary I was I just celebrated my
birthday and this it's like you never
know who's gonna be into the colors you
know like for people that do not know a
lot about makeup manufacturing you don't
just like come up with an idea last week
and then it comes out next week during
the summer I was already working on
holiday and also spring of next year
because makeup manufacturing does take
longer than most people think so I
created these months ago so when you
finally see your babies out there in the
world and people are seeing all the
colors and the swatches it's
nerve-racking it's like Oh anxiety and I
just want to say thank you guys so much
I want to give you a big hug to the
phone and the computer right now I have
oh my god hi Claus I haven't never had
that many orders in one day so you guys
broke all my records I thought summer
was poppin but you guys came so
strong and showed me so much love I
don't even know what to say I'm like
coming to ramble because I'm speechless
it was just so unreal to see I mean my
shade just ceased sold out in under one
day I thought I'd have enough for at
least a month and I was like oh she's
gone great so I'm definitely working on
making more of these right now and I
don't know like last year I put in
drogyny in my permanent collection
because you guys asked for it so if you
guys want to cease to be in the
permanent line next year let a bitch
know but I just want to say thank you
again I could never explain how just
beautiful that moment was for me so
mwah I love you guys and there's a lot
more coming so I can't wait so I never
talk about like lip conditioners but I
finally found one that I am literally
obsessed with and Nathan loves it
because men always have chapped lips
y'all my girl use a lip scrub but
besides the lip scrub girl
I found the wine I am this is the
essential lip enhancer from the brand is
away cosmetics and it's basically like a
lip conditioner now I have like five of
these I keep one in my car in my purse
and Nathan's pocket I always like to
have my lips feeling a really smooth and
I feel like this is like top tier of lip
balm so if you guys are looking for
something new for the holidays and it's
 cold where you live
try this bitch out my next and last item
for makeup and this is kinda like a
little skincare thing now whenever I see
a youtuber use something that I've never
used before it definitely brings out the
curiosity and me like don't do I need
that so I saw mani do a video a while
ago and the thumbnail was genius
it was his makeup smeared everywhere and
he was just like I thought I was
a-hole like it was really funny so I
clicked it and this item for removing
makeup appeared and I was like oh my god
and he was like hey everyone this is the
 that I'm using la la la and I was
like okay like I've been taking off my
makeup the same way for a long time was
at the timer for my transition I saw him
use this cleanse
take the day off it's like a cleansing
balm and I was like oh my god really
like I've been using makeup wipes and
cleanser for a really long time so this
stuff is literally like a bomb I've been
using it a lot and I love it to take my
nails and get a big old scoop and it
literally dissolves your makeup off so I
was like okay like you y'all know that
this bitch likes to wear a mask of
foundation and powder and makeup and I
know I get asked all the time how the
hell do you take it off at the end of
the day well this accelerates that
process and it literally like you takes
them off you rub it you can rub it
everywhere your eyes brow everything
just like gets almost like a rainbow
like when you mix
seven colors together and you get like
this weird color that's what happens to
your face and it melts it off I take a
makeup wipe and I just take it all up
and it just really makes it quicker and
it's amazing so clinic thanks bitch okay
so let's dive into some fashion
everybody now you guys know Jeffrey is a
handbag whore and I collect
I've been collecting handbags
and that type of stuff for I think going
on almost 15 years now so I love Hermes

tier of high-end and you guys all know
what a Birkin is by now I did a what's
in my Birkin bag video months ago which
I will put up right here key so I love
Hermes Birkin bags they are so stunning
they're beautiful they are hand crafted
and it takes about two days to make one
purse so I'm like a girl okay I love I
love detail now I love the color pink

my middle name and they came out with
this mini sized burkinwell mini for me I
usually get the 30s and this is a mini
Birkin in a baby pink Barbie white trim

my BMW i8 oh my god it's like almost the
