channel now today I am bringing the
drama I've been really inspired by color
lately I know sometimes I stick to like
soft neutral looks but I mean come on
it's Geoffrey Mother star we gotta bring
the color so today I'm giving you a
pastel goth cotton candy inspired glam
look I hope you guys enjoy it and also
coming soon I will be doing some videos
on new products I know it hinted at the
highlighters which you'll see later in
this video
I also have an eyeshadow palette coming
out which no one has seen yet so we're
gonna be filming a swatch reveal on that
and I have even more liquid lips coming
out you guys thought I was playing for
2016 because I am not slowing down so in
April we got new liquid lips and the
highlighters towards the end of May I'll
be releasing my first ever eye shadow
palette I am so excited if you live in
the SoCal area I will be debuting my eye
shadow palette at RuPaul's Drag Con
which is at the LA Convention Center if
you use code Jeffries jar you get 10%
off on your tickets so I will leave all
that info below I hope to see you there
first-come first-serve for my palette so
if you don't want to wait on line and
you live in the area you better be there
alright now put on some sunglasses crack
open a Red Bull and enjoy this look now
to start I'm actually gonna leave no
brows today now that I have these
amazing bangs I don't need brows so
we're gonna stick to the very goth alien
jeffree star 10th grade look that I used
to do and to start this I'm gonna cope
my entire lids with a white skin color
base and today I'm gonna be using the
new Kat Von D shade + light contour quad
oopah is a mouthful and this is the rust
palette I love her new packaging like hi
this is very high-end and these are the
four colors that come with it these are
not enough so we're just gonna stick
with this light one today just for the
base and then we'll move on to a
different palette but let's see if these
are pigmented oh and hi
cat never fails to deliver so I am
already excited about the entire lid and
I'm actually going to bring the shadow
up all the way and I'm going to take
this and pull it all the way back so it
would be a lot easier to blend later
Google pastel goth there is a different
like variation of the looks that
everybody gives it's like mainly a dark
lip and kind of light eyes or sometimes
it's like a pastel and really dark so
I'm gonna give it a little Geoffrey
twist and I'm just gonna dive into this
sugarpill heartbreaker palette and we're
gonna go right in with this hot blue
called velocity oh my lower they are
really highly pigmented you touch your
brush once oh good morning and they're
ready to play so I'm gonna using my
Chanel eyeshadow dome blending brush I
love this one and I'm just gonna dive in
and start sketching out a little bit of
a crease if you want you can sketch it
out a little higher or you can stick to
your natural crease line since I have no
brows I have a little bit more room to
play with and I'm definitely gonna be
banking on that today so I'm gonna take
this and since I have no brows I want to
create a long like feminine definition
to the eyes so I'm gonna be taking the
shadow and going all the way in and then
we're gonna drag up and this doesn't
have to look perfect because we are
going to use another brush to blend up
but the base shadow that we previously
just applied is definitely gonna help
blend everything out already so hi
thank you all right now I'm gonna drag
that all the way down to my lash line
just a little bit in there notice I'm
leaving some room for color right here
and color right there I'm going to add
in two more colors actually so you don't
want to take that blue too far and I'm
just kind of doing it half way into my
eyelid and of course we'll buff and
blend out that better so no worries
today we're going to be pulling out this
makeup gem this is that Natasha de Nonna
palette it's one of the palettes she has
like a million these calm wife you know
just like you know one or two shades
good morning so I'm looking at this
palette clearly this
one this one and this one it needs to
get all on this face so first we're
going to take this sky-blue amazingness
and I'm gonna be using that sugar pill
blending eyeshadow brush and I'm just
going to be dipping into that one
alright now I'm gonna take that color
and merge it with that darker one that
we just put on and I'm just going to
kind of blend up and out I'm going to
merge those two and use it as a blending
color and then we're gonna go back in
with our first blending brush with a
little extra product of that cat palette
and we're just gonna blend come on sky
blue and this is where I'm gonna drag it
out a little bit more blue Oh Diana I'm
gonna add in a little pop of colors so I
mean look there are so many options I'm
looking down in all these eyeshadows and
I'm just like why did you do this to me
why now there's this really pretty
cyborg foiled silver now I've used this
once before and I wedded the brush I wet
the brush whetted went wetter
whatever I'm gonna use my mac fix+ this
is the lavender flavor and I'm just
gonna coat this Bobbi Brown little
blending brush and we're just gonna dip
into that silver and oh my god it's like
whoa alright we're just gonna take that
silver right on the lid
oh yes and just start packing that in
there now if you don't want the brush
you might not get the desired intensity
that you want so I definitely recommend
doing that and I'm gonna take it all the
way down now we are gonna blend out this
part a little bit in a second so if
you're like girl that looks a little
janky I am definitely not done and
because my sockets are so big I'm
actually gonna bring that silver all the
way to my like nose basically in there
and see that when I turn to the side it
looks so pretty now my lids don't look
like terminator I me then we just
didn't do it enough so I'm gonna keep
layering and layering
now that the silver is down I definitely
need to go in and blend out a little
more so we're just gonna go back in with
our first loop I like to press a little
bit around the edges of where that
silver was so we're just kind of having
them merge become besties or you know
lovers
whichever way you guys want to do it now
to adding a little bit of death and
drama I'm going to be going in with this
really dark dark blue shade in here and
I'm actually going to touch this little
duochrome moment right here I'm going to
take the dark blue actually and do a
little bit under my eyes as well but
let's do the crease first so I'm just
taking a little Mac two one seven and
that dark blue is so pigmented like you
really got to be careful so I'm going to
be really delicate and just start
tucking that dark color a little bit in
there this is for depth and drama if you
want it a little lighter just skip this
part but I'm gonna take that sugarpill
brush one more time and just help blend
and blend alright I actually switched my
idea so I did the darkness on here with
my crease and then I'm like do I need to
add even more color I think it's pretty
good for now until we do lashes for the
top I'm like okay I'm loving this it's
very like alien cyborg sky-blue like I
don't even know Titanic drowning sexy I
don't know what the I'm saying but
you guys get the drift I'm loving it
let's move to under my eyes okay so I
was looking all my makeup trying to find
a good pink and of course I pull up more
sugarpill this is the pro palette you
can usually get these out like the imap
makeup trade shows or that type of thing
I don't think they sell them online but
there's a pink in there right there and
I'm like ooh girl so we're gonna dip
into
and I'm also gonna do a little more
inner corner under and I found this
engli pigment eyeshadow it is so pretty
so I am going to give that a whirl today
and I'm going to be using my little Mac
to 19.8 brush I know what I normally use
Inglot a lot on my channel but I am
obsessed with this pigment so once again
we're gonna wet that brush a little bit
and I like to just pour some in the
pigment into the cap like so so I'm just
gonna take this and put it right at that
inner corner oh my god I'm gagging this
is so pretty this is the definition of
like esta drama I'm being really
delicate as usual I'm barely touching my
skin imagine this as like a highlight on
my cheek ooh I might have to do that
like every day now and because I have
OCD and glitter obsession I'm just going
back over and over honestly I think one
layer is enough but this is the Jeffrey
show here we're gonna do like 16 layers
all right now we're gonna dip into that
sugarpill paint with the exact same
brush let's keep it moving and I'm just
gonna continue to drag this out now this
pink is very pink so be careful we're
just going to merge these two together
and notice how I'm not gonna go all the
way because I am going to take that dark
blue that we put in my crease a second
ago and we are gonna bring a little bit
of that down so I'm not gonna do the
entire thing oh my god like Pinker than
my okay now the pink is laid down
gonna go back in with this really really
dark blue and I'm gonna be using this
little more thief 5:07 brush hi little D
Taylor what's up girl I love this little
guy so we're just gonna really lightly
just dot in there and I'm gonna take
this dark blue and just merge it with
that pink really thin like we want this
under eye to look like a cotton candy
orgasm you want those eyeshadows to
merge together so it should create a
little kind of purple moment which is
what happens
blue and pink get together hi color
wheel all right now I'm not gonna do a
wing for this look but I am gonna smudge
a little black liner where the lashes
are gonna go I think there's so much
color going on here that just needs a
little bit of depth so I'm gonna take my
max smolder pencil and I'm just gonna
really lightly like we're talking barely
there so I'm just gonna kind of tight
line in there so really minimal that is
now obviously it's not smudged out yet
somebody's my little more feet 5:08
brush I love this and I'm just going to
take that and smudge out that top liner
just a hair all right now before we do
mascara and lashes I'm gonna do some
white eyeliner and I you're like oh my
god so more liner girl we are not done
this is an intricate little look so
we're gonna take max fascinating white
pencil this is my favorite for the
waterline whoo you gotta hold your
breath and just get through this one
real quick if you hit your waterline so
we're gonna take this pencil and we're
just gonna put it right in the waterline
now because of all these bright colors
you've got to be careful because this
liner can hug onto color as well and
like take it and turn like pink so
you've got to be really careful now I
think this really completes the look
it's like that extra subtlety
hi all right now for lashes you
definitely want to look like a doll so
we're gonna first coat our lashes with
the new Too Faced waterproof better than
sex oh my god I told you guys I had been
waiting to try this this is one of my
favorite mascaras so let's see what
happens a same amazing wand as before
let's see how this works now I got so
excited I blinked and got mascara under
my eye so I'm just gonna use a little
primer to wipe it off off camera I'll be
back in two seconds all right I did my
whole entire mascara off camera actually
got it on my hair like girl I was having
a moment I told myself deep breath and
then I got too excited and got it all
over myself so mascara is on now it's
time for lashes we're going to do
something really soft and wispy and
natural haha
just kidding we're gonna go in with the
new sugar pill heiress lashes oh my god
I saw these and I was like these are
made for me let's put these babies on
and let's see what happens I'm just
gonna put these right on the lash line
oh my god and I'm gonna take tweezers
and help press these on so they stay
fabulous oh holy
these are some of those lashes but you
just got a hold in place for a second
let God do its its magic and I'm just
gonna wave and blow
oh my god Amy from sugar pill if you
were watching this you have created my
new favorite lashes these are so dope
I'm like hi I'm obsessed okay I can
start these eyes for like six more hours
but you guys know what time it is it's
time for the main event highlighting
alright now I'm gonna stick to the true
Gulf pastel look so if you notice today
I don't really do any contour which is
so weird for me I'm like huh where's my
cheekbones oh there there I'm going to
be using this blush highlighter from
Burberry now you guys know I'm ever very
poor I am living for that packaging it's
just so cute so basically the white part
the highlighter inside the blush it's
more subtle than it looks and mmm smells
like a lush bath bomb
that is so crazy yummy okay so I'm gonna
be using this Chanel powder brush and it
says just just swirl around oh wow hmm
let's pray and this is not too pigmented
because I do not want rosy ass cheeks
I'm gonna really finely just kind of oh
wow okay we'll be sharing that down in
like two seconds
so okay hyper very at least we know you
have pigment thank God the worst is when
you spend money on these higher end
brands and then they just suck dicks so
thank God that is nice so I am going to
take that all the way and let's just
blend out
more now if you if you put too much
blush on like I just did and you're like
oh my god you can just take a powder
brush and like a little bit of your
powder so today we use that kavanah Quan
I'm just gonna dip into there and then
I'll go back in with that blush I put it
on top
I'm just kind of there we go just want
to share down cute now it's like my
cheeks are flushed and ready to kill
okay now I haven't done just blushed
without really any contour and so long I
forgot the contour has become such a fad
the last four years that I didn't really
do it before now a few videos ago I
showed you guys a new product from my
brand that is called a skin frost it is
a face and body highlighting powder that
I developed and when I said that I was
going to make highlighters I got an
overwhelming response this is the first
time I'm ever showing the inside of the
compact this is the inside we have the
jeffree star cosmetics logo really big I
know the sparkles are intense too my
camera's probably like oh my god we are
going to use my favorite more feet 5 10
brush now a little goes a really long
way I know I've said that before in
other videos and your public bitch
please listen we're barely gonna touch
this that's all you need and we are
going to put this highlight right on top
of that blush now this shade is called
ice cold and it is for really pale
people so you see that I've barely even
touched my cheek it's already like
barium so you really don't need to use a
lot now obviously if you're me want to
use more than the average bear but I am
just so except for these to finally come
out I know I've been talking about them
for a few months I really wanted to
perfect the formula you guys know if my
liquid lip I was not playing games and
that does not mean that will change for
any future product I've never used this
for like a full-on look like this before
so I am
loving it okay now you guys know we
gotta do that Cupid's bow now you can
tell hi this is really light show we're
gonna just lightly do that on there if
you put too much just to a beauty
blender I don't want it to look like
I've been sucking off a pixie or a
unicorn so it's gonna do a little tip of
my nose like alright oh my god my nose
looks like it's the control tower at the
airport so we're just gonna share that
down a little bit since I didn't have
any contour on I don't want my nose to
look really insane but I definitely want
that really cool glow moment there we go
hi knows you've been dipped in metal now
that highlighting is done we need to do
lips all right now for this look I'm
gonna keep up with the whole pastel goth
theme if you will and I'm gonna be using
my own brand today hi Shan --less plug
and I'm never using shade abused this is
a really dark navy gothy it's inspired
from a Marilyn Manson song so we're
gonna keep with that dark makeup theme
this is a really unique shade not a lot
of brands have Navy this is like dark
black blue and let's start painting once
web coverage hope we're not playing
today oh wow oh Lord I always hold my
breath when I do liquid lips because
especially with dark shades you've got
to make sure those lines are perfect
alright the lipstick is done and dry oh
my god it's so crazy how a lip could
like change your entire like the whole
look is like whoo you guys know I cannot
finish or complete a look without some
setting spray so let's see what we got
today we got a jumbo mist and fix or we
got the Urban Decay all nighter I think
I'm gonna do because I really can't
decide today it I'm gonna be the
first person to do a double setting
spray y'all bitches don't even try me
after this one because I'm doing it
alright let's gear engines set and ready

mix thank you Oh whew look I just took a
bath all right you guys this look is
