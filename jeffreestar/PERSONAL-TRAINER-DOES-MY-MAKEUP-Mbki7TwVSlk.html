channel today we have a special guest
this is Aidan guys I'm sure you can tell
by the title and you've seen 18 in my
beauty campaigns before you've seen them
on my Twitter y'all are thirsty as fuck
but Aidan is Nate's personal trainer and
sometimes mine so Aidan and Nate we're
working out the other day and I stopped
there and I go hmm I think Aidan should
try to do my makeup so I asked you guys
all on Twitter and Twitter blew up
shouldn't move up they were like yes
please they believed in me they believed
in you they wanna see what you can do
they know you can bench press I can I
will be able to hold the makeup I know
that for long periods of - yes you'll be
able to hold these heavy brushes yes I
can handle that we're gonna put weights
on actually all of them let's do it I'm
down to get a pump okay so let's let's
recap okay me and you met 2016 yeah
Aidan was in my lip ammunition campaign
for jeffree star cosmetics that's where
a lot of people saw him for the first
time and we've just stayed friends this
whole entire time but you've never done
makeup on anyone never done makeup on
anyone at all anyone at all have you
ever personally worn makeup like for
Halloween costume for modeling I have
okay yes before but never that's it yeah
I mean just the modeling has been makeup
okay do you have any sisters I have a
little sister yay and then what how old
is she all that is graduating she's 18
okay the she need a makeup or not into
it all natural natural I love that okay
and then what about mom mom got bail
match okay this is gonna be a full
free-for-all there's no experience today
and coach put me on I love that so I'm
gonna just show you some products and
the steps cuz obviously I don't think
you're gonna know what step to do first
and looking at all this how do you feel
anxious really anxious it's just it's
overwhelming this is a foundation 100
dollars that's 110 dollars sure it's and
that's but then you can also go to Rite
Aid and find one that's nine dollars and
it actually kind of works the same well
that's the way to go
balling on a budget right so
you know so we like to do both on this
channel it's also all about the extreme
now I'm just gonna pull out a bunch of
products and you're gonna just try to do
your best masterpiece
I'm gonna get everything I got okay all
right you guys if you want to see this
are we calling it debauchery no we're
gonna be positive
Ruby positive oh you're gonna kill I
might kill it okay I mean oh I'm going
to kill you're going okay all right so
if you guys want to see Aidan transform
me then keep on watching all right so
we're gonna get started here now Aidan
has no idea what's about to go down
no so we're gonna use a primer first so
primer is something you use to make sure
your pores and everything kind of stay
away from the environment from pollution
from all the chemicals you're about to
slap on yeah and just gives you a
barrier so we're gonna go in with this
one look at this crazy guy oh wow this
is touch ah touch ha yep this silk
canvas all right so all you're gonna do
this is like a bomb and you just kind of
like take some and you're just gonna put
it on my face like aftershave right how
much would you say less you would know
that's a lot that's a lot that's that's
that's for like 10 faces okay let's
let's you always match your round I've
it down uh-huh there that's a good
amount right yeah I'm just gonna mix it
yeah you just put it all over here we go
I want to match all right yeah the owner
of talk shop might die when she sees how
much you were gonna put on me but it's
okay I mean I like to talk to her and
you can go a little bit neck if you want
no I got a cheese down there that's
grandma that's grandma hey I'm Graham
how are you getting with something mrs.
star there we go all right I feel you
feel like it's in I feel almost pretty
good about it okay I'm getting there
how's my skin today up close some people
thinks good all airbrushed in photos now
it's the real deal guys it's the real
deal
all right so Foundation Ayden wants to
stay on a budget today so we're gonna
use the maybelline superstay actually
really love this I know you're like
great are you wondering why I have two
shades yeah what's with that so
sometimes brands don't make colors that
match you exactly because there's so
many skin tones out there from the
palest person to the darkest person
right so you never know how is it gonna
look at home and sometimes it like
oxidizes you know
you put on your face then they can get
darker like changes and it's just like
it's woman's number one like complaint
is trying to find a foundation match we
like to mix so we're gonna just put a
little bit I use the table Aidan is
never obviously play to think it before
so we're giving him a morphe beauty
sponge and then that's it so we're gonna
use what shades are these because
everyone's gonna read me to the ground
102 and 112 you're just gonna buff and
see what how can I go for it yeah all
right here we go Jeffrey I'm going in
okay I'm scared okay it is Darnell we're
going for it this is the best I've ever
looked oh so you just smear it around
and make sure that I'm covered who works
harder than Jim me your name oh right on
this bye Nance both go I mean Joe's hard
he does actually does really hard every
day like yeah Nate gets that point where
he's like gonna vomit like he works yeah
and then it's happened a couple times
but it had you know we're making
memories so when someone works out and
they do throw up a lot of people may
think that's a negative right I mean
usually what ends up happening is I mean
throwing up it wasn't positive but but
usually I will say the number one thing
is the client hate 30 minutes before it
came and then it just comes out and it
fully or last night you had a really
rough night
you know maybe ate like a whole box of
pizza some Top Ramen
yeah getting drunk the night before you
work out hard is probably a horrible
idea yeah it's probably not the best
idea but if you do get super wasted I've
noticed that people react a lot better
working out the next day at least they
sweat out some of the tongs oh there's a
gym every smell like vodka or tequila
never happen okay it just smells like
ass never right never alcohol are we
looking at her brushed and like Tara
being glorious alright so before we
start concealer my whole entire channel
would love it if we could continue this
episode
shirtless oh I've been sure there's a
million times on my channel you haven't
so give the people if they want yeah
time for an outfit change
I look so pale compared to you all right
so now it's time for concealer we're
gonna go on with makeup revolution this
is a really cool drugstore brand cheap
and really great sweet so you know what
to conceal no my bad mood my anxiety so
people left the book concealer like
under their eyes like just to like
brighten and like fix dark circles okay
okay yeah yeah I feel more free with the
shirt off okay good good I feel like
this is gonna give me more more of an
edge yep
put that on anywhere and then you use
this again to do that to blend and down
yes sweet okay we're going in we're
going boom Wow let's just go a little
all right there a little pop uh-huh oh
maybe ha okay highlight on the
cheekbones okay boom when you were
telling everyone that you were gonna do
makeup they told your highlight wasn't
the key I said do the highlight pop now
it's time to dab mm-hmm I like the
dabbing part I loved you like you didn't
do a lot of concealer just like light
and cannot really yeah okay we're Dabba
yeah I just blend it out and I mean you
said to dab pretty hard
good my face can take it boom boom boom
things are happening okay what if you
replaced everyone on YouTube like you're
the new guru I've gotta be crazy all
right so now so now we're gonna set the
concealer we don't want to crease right
right no creases it is you're actually
gonna use this again same tools here I'm
just gonna dab into the powder and then
press it onto where your concealer was
purchase and where that was but you
meant don't you worry okay we're going
in before this concealer sets you just
place it wherever you want just what the
concealer was there we go you can get a
bright under the eye if you want don't
be afraid okay alright because I look
like Casper it's time for some contour a
little Kella
we need a little color so your first
brush no more sponge I'm moving on
you're moving on up we're gonna go in
with the Marc Jacobs which one is this
one the tan tastic Omega bronzer now I

I think that's a lot all right how do I
look guys damn good alright alright so

contour and I said you could use another
brush and you kind of said go over it I
think more is better
okay I always love more yeah fused fuse
diffuse oh well that's cool that's cool
okay yeah love it I like that decision
highlighting is everyone's favorite part
a lot of people take the desert of the
face so you can put highlighting
anywhere you want to like really
accentuate and blind the world so we're
gonna go in with this new glow kit from
Anastasia Beverly Hills called dream I
love the packaging dreamy dreamy here's

highlighting on the nose yeah it's like
a like a lighthouse that people know oh
yeah you walk into a rice white people
do it on your nose is like blinding yeah
man you're definitely making like a
statement now do I gotta hear all right
time for eyeshadow this is where we
really determine whether I'm gonna go
blind
no Michael I've fought some pressure no
pressure
okay so I pulled up a look that my
friend just did on me um a little soft
bronze eagle and ice that's the easy one
this is an easier glam I said or we have
you can do this look on me yeah yeah

darker shade I don't know that's pretty
cool then I close your eyes I'm gonna

let's close her up
sorry here you're already sorry no like
I felt good about the foundation
foundations like a breeze right yeah
foundation easy okay eyebrows you know
it's hard but we got through it together
I shadow that's something okay next step
would be mascara look my neighbor's
laugh okay so just close your eyes right
yeah so for the sake of no injuries yeah
I'm gonna give you a tip yeah okay this
is like that so when you're one of when
a person's looking down so right not
closed
looking down then you can take the wand
I'm just kind of like oh go up yeah so
they just kind of look angled down
mm-hmm and then you want to look up when
you're doing the bond at the bottom here
okay yeah so let's angle your eyes let's
do this BAM
all right so eyes are angled down mm-hmm
and then if you can just turn right
there oh this is the weirdest sensation
ever isn't it crazy yeah you want to
take the one and go from the other side
too I want to go up yeah not down either
way you want you just want okay yeah
okay
look down and then you're yeah I'm gonna
go on yeah exactly whoa whoa god that's
crazy
uh-huh yeah I can actually blink into
the browser okay yeah yeah team effort
um I'm gonna get the lowers it's okay
it's okay
you got this I have Tom interest it's
shaking
boom difference you can tell us a
difference okay definitely a differs not
add more all right let's put the mascara
back we don't want it to dry yes mm-hmm
I'm feeling in this fantasy so I felt
like when you were doing my makeup that
you did a lot of more eye shadow on this
side but not this side I was what's your
technique it's just a certain type of
look okay what are we going for my best
friend out a Dalmatian and oh I love
that yeah okay it's kind of channeling
crow deville I love that okay um now a
lot of people um do false lashes I think
we're gonna skip that today yeah that's
a different level isn't it yeah yeah
I'll just do less push-ups later if we
can try this part do you got a BAM okay
now the main focus of a lot of people's
looks and what my brand is known for of
course is lipsticks so when a girl is
wearing a lip what is your favorite
color on a woman does it depend on the
mood definitely not black okay a lot
kind of scares me black lipstick this is
really intense okay no goth moment no
you see so many hues here we got nudes
we got red like it's like a red would be
cool like okay but for this maybe with
the one eye thing let's go with the nude
okay a nude now here's the thing about
makeup there's like 25 nudes so it's
like what tone oh just look right here
in his grab one fell off the bottom skin
tight perfect wow that's cool okay great
this is a little more yeah it's liquid
lip it's a liquid and it dries matte it
socks it's not like a lipstick like the
old school like with the big yeah so if
we remember the lip ammo which oh yeah
standard bullet right
and then that is like a liquid version
okay this is gonna be cool mm-hmm so
give me a like the palette right you go
ah forget color huh yeah it's not like
too intense
uh-huh but it's still there and then the
top mm-hmm a little bit more you look
good
no yeah I'm saying I'm gonna stay
confident here okay we got ya tight on
the lip now a final step that everyone
does here on YouTube and a lot of beauty
gurus is that we like to set the makeup
so you spent all this time doing it it
looks flawless you got all you got to
lock it in right behind you here's a
bunch of setting sprays okay let's just
grab just grabbing all nighter mm-hmm
are you gonna know they're all night a
different one Oh another all mm-hmm he
already slayed the skin now we need to
stay on well lovely know how to shake
Gayle you guys shake it you actually do
need to shake that one and then you just
give it a few sprays on the face to coat
it
I think that was a little more a little
bit more actually okay one drink
that might have been too much I feel
good you're like saturated oh I am okay
then you just want you want to take
something and just like ban it okay I
don't want to ruin your work but you
could just like politely Preston and the
foundation stays amazing okay Wow look
I'm so good okay you know I don't feel
like amazing but I feel like you know I
did pretty good with what I have okay
before I looked at Nate come see if it's
let's see what Nathan proved yeah okay
all right so I haven't looked yet I'm so
excited to see the final results but I
wanted to bring me in to get his first
reaction so Nate has his eyes closed
Nate go behind the camera good thing
okay look now you guys am i loud Oh
Aidan you think it's different
YOUnique could my god this jaw contour
is the best I've ever really yeah okay
this is honestly a fucking luck look oh
my oh what happened here
Matt mascara not a thing okay um mate
this is the new brow look yeah I won't
have to call the tattoo artist I want
this tattoo oh I'm spilling I'm
speechless I love the like smokey eye
and then like soft glam over here yeah
okay let's do a quick recap together
okay let's go what was your each easiest
easiest thing that you did on me today
by far foundation I felt like a
foundation the dabbing I like the
dabbing but that one was cool the brow
like I felt like I started strong and
then when we mentioned the word tail I
lost it which one started strong this
one yeah I started strong on the outside
and then when you said tell like give it
a little Talon okay and then from there
I kind of just lost lost at all you lost
focus oh yeah it's just didn't have it
in me the highlight on the know this is
maybe my favorite part I'll take it and
I'll take what I can get and then what
happened with the lip here it looks like
lip I was a little confused like with
the edges
all right here do you have them go like
would you open up do you power cuz I
feel like I put it where there is no
like whether my skin yeah like you're
not supposed to have alaya
it's okay a lot of a lot of people over
draw these days we're being positive
right trying to do pop okay most
difficult thing you say was brow brow
and that's just where I kind of lost it
okay that's where you've got off kilter
yeah overall this is a really good art
piece I think I feel like I was going a
little bit artistic creates a good
installation piece too like we could do
a lot with this you guys I am officially
cremated now working people find you if
they're in the Los Angeles area give us
the team so mad a gym
viii true in Hollywood okay the private
training facility okay we worked on
weight training we have group classes
okay making people stronger for their
everyday lives I'm someone that likes
more like a one-on-one or of course but
Nate's there I just don't see I don't
think maybe I'm one of those people that
maybe a lot of you out there can relate
where you don't want to like work out in
front of like 75 people on in jindo and
it's super important like that's what I
love about the private facility is it is
one-on-one
everyone's programs different everyone's
needs or different people's different
yes and so that's what we do we really
take it in we see what you're eating
what's your daily habit like what time
do you work like to work out in the day
with MB of energy what time do you not
so that we can stay on track that's the
biggest even though I assume people know
a lot of information um I've been
noticing a lot lately that people they
want to work out they have goals but
they're still eating really horrible
yeah and I get that a lot everyone's
like Jeffrey how do you stay so thin
like - the Red Bull and the cupcakes I
do eat healthy yeah I'm working out is
very important it's half of what you eat
no and you have really strong like with
cardio like you're super strong like you
did the Stairmaster all the time I think
also for you some people do have that
jacked metabolism and yeah fortunate and
a lot of people don't hate me because I
eat what I want right 25 people start to
really like lose the metabolism but they
do there are those people that you know
what everyone think red and Sun Life at
the same time yes haha but a lot of
people I think miss interpret like well
I can eat all this bullshit and still
work out but I'm like no you're not your
body's not gonna get to the right you
want you didn't look physically
appealing but your insides can be dyed
yeah and that's the thing you don't want
you know I want to I know and YouTube
had that problem right just kidding
Jeffrey reading every would have built
for five minutes straight I agree okay
so you do private training people can
find you I'm gonna link everything down
