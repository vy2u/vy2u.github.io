the force values brand new crazy pro
palates which are insane here we'll hold

has 28 shape there are three versions oh
my god they're huge so today I thought

them on our eyes and we're going to do

Nellie what oh come on I love the warmth
and the cool tone one I mean I'm not a
cool tone yeah lover like upset yeah I
think it's a cute palette very cute it's
a little boy well okay a bit cool tone
yeah option but it is a boring palette
and like even the pretty gold is in this
one so thank you so from someone that
has been making makeup for a few years
now it's really hard to perfect and slay
a neon eye and for someone that reviews
a lot of makeup or or does the nails are
hard they're very hard and I honestly
never expect that much from a neon I
don't either but there's a lot we got 1

hello yes so besides that um of course
do not forget to subscribe to my channel
well you me you for listening to doesn't
headphones I'm sorry are you guys
besides that if you want to see if you
fucking Sephora bro balls are worth it
keep on watching alright so when you buy
the Sephora Pro palette it comes in this
unit carton like this and on the back it
does say all the shade name I liked it
it tells you which palette you know I
think you and you can see what colors
you're going to get you obviously can't
see on the outside basically this says
create endless looks featuring rich
velvety warm pigments and golden
textures that light up your eyes so this
is the one that lowers about the dress
mine has more neons crazy vivid so
besides the box which is a nice by the
way it is expensive paper in my opinion
I comes with this little plastic insert
which can I be real with you yeah I love
you wash through it but I feel like it's
a little Natasha Giannone with the
plastic insert
it really does okay and no tea no shade
you guys when I first saw them I thought
it was a Natasha palette which of course
no tea no shade
Sephora does carry Natasha's line if
you're unfamiliar with it me and Laura
have used these before yeah they look
like this and I was honestly a little
shook because let's open this up it
comes with a plastic thing that's what
just like you know we aren't my thoughts
but at least that one says the name oh
yeah right but honestly this looks to be
side-by-side yeah they're so similar
yeah unreal these pens are a little
rectangular these a little more we're
over here but still it's just the setup
at all very very familiar I was like
okay girl but hey Sephora carries
Natasha so and honestly at the end of
the day I know a lot of people read the
this brand to self because they are very
pensive
yes sunset palette that is kind of going
viral I mean the other $20 gee this is
over 200 by the way so if you're someone
that is like this you've got the wrong
one you might have a dupe yeah on your
hand
these are $68 so if you do the math you
guys and you divide them up it's like
two $42.42 percent shadow which isn't
bad at all and hopes that these are good
shadows but I mean it's not a bad deal I
do want to kind of mention that I mean
we did Ally matted eat food but I did
wash my hands
yeah okay there it is you can talk about
the negative mean makeup we get dirty I
have moisturizer yeah yeah a lot of our
palettes can still see but it is just
something to bring attention to yes but
I do love the hollow moment here your
this goal I like the goal and gets
pretty here a heavy winter night I agree
it's actually heavier than um let me
know I'm the same I would say about the
same whoo all right let's do it let's do
it all right so I'm just going to
quickly pry my lid with a Mac painterly
paint-pot like I would normally do I've
already done my lids I did soft ochre
Paint Pot by Mac so I am ready to go
unlike Sena bub oh all right so we're
going to kind of do step by step
together like all over color transition
I increase so what do you what are we
going to go in i go in with i like to
put a little cream color kind of all
over to lighten up eyeshadow primer same
so i'm like
lots of payoff weight coming out I left
it's all out I was great but so I'm
going to go on with shade porcelain
which is this white one okay
definitely powdery oh yeah but doesn't
have extreme payoff that's what I want
to see so I guess let's try it on camera
yeah whoa I would definitely say major
pay off so it doesn't has a lot of kick
back but they are I mean pigmented this
is fucking white like I love putting a
fake white down I mean there's a lot of
Fallout on here but on the eye it's fun
yeah okay what should we do next
alright next I'm saying I'm going to go
in with this transition shade right here
a little bit of a soapy tan color oh my
god I mean I might just be bold honestly
and you'll say anything I think you
should I'm dying to try this formula I'm
like does it pink work or not oh that's
a lotta kick back obviously you would
never hold this up in Riley so it did
fall down here I'm just going to die so
you're going to kind of go through that
I shed a little bit quicker okay I want
to see your anyway I do mine oh well all
right now I got like this not I gotta
try this fucking pink because I'm shook
so let's just see how it works
oh my god this is good I mean look I
don't really think that like fallout is
a negative and what palette doesn't have
fallout but this is a little extreme
yeah alright so the pink actually
blended out really nice I took the white
shade and I went over it to blend out
and I'm like looks like unreal actually
besides that I'm ready to keep moving
yes so we're going to do next I'm gonna
put a little bit of this crazy neon
maybe in here yeah that's another Matt
I'm gonna actually mix these two
together I love mixing a neutral
eyeshadow so to get that warm you don't
have a fear of is your nail to sliding
it huh nice like that one they already
ruined I didn't do that you did that
didn't really yeah I don't believe me
oh this I called Geoffrey in here ah
look this spelled your name wrong and
puke-green ami Eliza Helen another name
that's cute that's really sorry I don't
know any of
eventually what skin tight we're too
skinny
okay I'm gonna go in with Amy all right
I mix my to addition what just a lot
thank you I know it's the same it's the
same like when I'm blowing on mine y'all
boiling it okay mines blending great
yeah look at me ooh pretty
yeah I love loving any of you are with a
camera I was doing a little extra mess
but I will say this though you do got to
be really careful because I know the
neons are really key is that for a week
straight I know and I've literally just
opened it all right girl what do we want
to try neck I really want to go into
this deeper Brown this will be my last
Matt no I know I mean how many miles day
I've been dying to dip into these purple
maybe I have a little unicorn mama
underneath my eye so I'm going to be
going in with this guy right here and
then a little bit of this we're going to
mix and match see what they got
see if we got some pigment baby oh I'm
looking in the monitor now I see it yeah
oh yeah okay grow are for you I love it
all right China Lee to the shimmer I
know I'm feeling very like a little pony
you're like vampy smokey so we
definitely want to try the metallics
what are they actually calling them I
think we should probably look at that
let's see iridescent textures that
empower sophistication so a shimmer
eyeshadow I mean basically so we're
going to use them dry Laura I'm not to
buy it's fucking third colleague I'm
giving you that my nose will take you
know okay fine that was the planning all
right so of course we're going to swatch
them all with our fingers and our arms
later but right now I mean people wear
fucking eye shadow on our eyes
right right I like to see what it looks
like on the eyes mostly swatches you
know whatever your finger but you're on
servicing me okay so we can try it dry
and then if we're not living we could do
6 plus yes so I'm going to go ahead and
try the cranberry color dry and I'm
going to try this beautiful glacier
color I just have like this feeling
internally that that's going to explode
with like dust oh great okay
it might not hear ya that is pretty for
a dry brush yeah yeah tiny bit of follow
on your cheek but not the answer I
almost want you to wet the basically I
want to women I have to wet it because
like I don't care if it's like Natasha
janela the best eyeshadow or whatever it
is I have no wet is it work yeah we all
everything I have to do it as well I
don't give a fuck how good something is
dry I kind of miss a fall out - yes
Oh have mercy on myself that just gave
it that extra fire yeah that's why I
wasn't okay let's try it
what's your eye where am I oh yeah no
whoa
let's see oh Jesus whoa why this is dry
you guys okay now it is a little crumbly
let's say yeah I'm gonna lie I need to
fall out see the more than it moves
around its kind of not being put that's
been John it's like kind of exploding
everywhere a little bit okay we're gonna
wet the brush can now let see how it
looks
oh wow okay that's intense fuck it's
doing the job it's just messy as hell
okay Wow overall the link that just
changes a whole eyelid that looks crazy
alright so the shimmer it's pretty
blinding it's really pretty
no it is a little chunky it's like a
little intense yeah it was not going to
lie but it works all out yeah there's
Paul was intense but it looks pretty
uh-huh like a super blinding okay now we
are going to quickly put on some mascara
off camera and then we're going to come
back and do some swatches alright so now
that we've played with them on the eyes
of course you guys saw how they look
blend it out you saw how they looked in
the pan so now we're going to pick ten
shades from each palette that we haven't
tried and just do some arm swatches and
I'm covered in tattoos so working these
Laura's arms
and I guess we'll start with the neon
editorial palette and let's get just
watching alright so we will try

lot of color that is a lot of payoff and
city house our fans and that is a lot on

let me just go in with my actual
fingertip hey it shows up a little more
color sometimes you guys I'm going down

my nail how it's getting color because
you know I'm the queen of reading a
bitch when they swatch wrong and I don't
let you guys know that it was catching
on my nail yeah okay let's do this

alright first things first I really want
to swatch which one a peach I was dying
to do I was love yeah kind of sheer and
shimmery but it definitely has some
color
that's pretty so pretty yeah I think
it's beautiful alright next I'm going to
do the golden color okay just kidding
I'm going to do the bronze oh oh I mean
in the most pigmented one I've ever done
okay that was great yeah let's do clay I
love that color pretty whoa let's try
ochre whoa that's good that is a pretty
yellow really good next to each other
I'm kind of living for that I want try
Brad holy oh that's stunning looks like
this one too
uh-huh they're very similar honestly all
right let's try chestnut whoa all right
let's get a little more like a weird I
wouldn't say that the chestnut color no
definitely it's like a mommy purple
that's a mommy shade this is brown oh my
water thank you so and there's nothing
on your finger okay ready wait I want it
again oh my what happened to that
gentleman is the rough setting these two
are and it's like fucking but a boo-boo
yeah we had to move so let's do coconut
shell it's kind of seen formula yeah
just see you're gonna show the cute name
better oh it's better monkey was a
little chunky huh all right
sand sand is like a pretty like pearly
shimmer okay oh wow real look at this
like falling off your skin look
oh my god holy okay one more I wanted to
try the fucking obsidian boy yeah let's
get it you want to know if it's a black
big man is good because black shadows
are hit or miss for me I certainly are
okay right here huh whoa look at that is
fuckin came here yeah and look you can
even tell that this looks bad wow yeah
yeah I know
this is stunning brown sugar is a poop
yes how do you feel about this watch is
well a little in miss but mostly amazing
yeah they're mostly really good I know
we're all laughing at the last few for
you but overall I was a little shook at
how well they even finger swatch
sometimes you never know yeah and at the
end of the day I know everyone at home
likes watches but you have to try it and
go oh my because you're not wearing out
your arm like you bought it for your
eyes so let's try it on I I know and I
think in this Instagram like YouTube era
everyone is like so crazy about the arm
watch yeah
I think that like when you're buying
something in the store you're not going
to go like this and go like this and
like okay it's going to work great yeah
really have to take a brush yeah blend
it out and see if it works
and at the end of the day these really
worked good I think they were amazing
they look beautiful super great quality
and I think it's a great price for the
amount of eyeshadow that you get yes and
the packaging is nice it's heavy it
feels good now for the pros looks like
white approach okay love how highly
pigmented they were agree loves how
heavy this was love the big mirror in
here
you know we are here oh we're absolutely
loaded questions in there hey the shade
of regions is great yeah it really is
awesome I like it so let's talk about
some of the cons okay obviously they
were super powdery the fallout was
that's the biggest con to me like that
was unreal like the pink definitely went
a lot of places yes so that was a little
bit of a negative for me they were like
super super fallout yeah honestly his
whole mirror has like a cast of dust
over it because of the amount of fallout
so that was a little negative and then
I'm just gonna miss my brown sugar it
should be taking half a pound
I might hoop put that one in there girl
what was responsible is every other
shame pretty good balance yeah applause
so I think for the price they're awesome
neon shades are hard to do so - the
fallout problem yeah um they look great
like my eyes look great your eyes look
great they're like BAM like when you put
that red on I was like no pretty cool so
I approve these what about Jeffrey start
a teen Trinity okay all jokes aside
these are Jeffrey's are approved
I think for the price they're good yeah
they're great quality and blend great I
mean shadows have kicked back this one
was a little extreme so of course if you
do own this or you're going to just be a
little careful and don't gig like if
you're heavy-handed girl you better
smoke one before you do your makeup okay
all right well I'm excited that these
are like a hit yeah same Oh nervous
