get so excited before a launch I'm like
yes I just can't wait for you guys to
try them all out and create some crazy
looks so let's dive into this video if
you want to see how I created this
craziness then keep on watching let's
jump into this now I've already pre
moisturized my face with the lemare
softening cream I'm feeling good now for
primer I'm going to be using my Becca
backlight primer this height she's
almost like empty I love this one it is
perfect for summer it just gives you
that inner glow and of course on the
damp Beauty Blender is going to do a few
pumps and you guys know what I love to
do just dot it all around the face and
then
blend it in okay I'm feeling glowy and
now of course we also have to do one
pump for the neck
never leave your neck alone or she's
going to be really angry and I'm just
going to bring that all the way down
now that we are primed and feeling
ourselves let's jump into foundation
today we're going to use three products
yes I said it three I'm going to be
using the l'oreal infallible pro glow I
am still a really big fan of this and
I've been using it a lot off-camera I'm
also going to be using my georgia armani
luminous silk foundation which this is
one of my favorites of all time and
because it's summer and we're gonna
 glow until people are like when
they look at us we're gonna be using
some cover FX enhancer drops and we're
gonna use shade that's an actual and
we're just gonna add a little drops in
there now of course if you want to use a
little metal plate you can I'm just
going to use the back of my hand now all
three of these products say shake so
let's get to shaking thank you mmm I'm
gonna use our money a little one two two
a nap and then we're gonna use some pro
glow and I'm just going to do like one
two little BAM it's a little drop and
then we're gonna do one two
I'm just gonna use a little metal
spatula and let's see what happens come
on science it's like baking
I'm just having fun you don't really
need to put on your foundation with a
metal stick okay but I am going to use a
beauty blender take a little bit more
product and let's get to blending now
this was a lot of product to mix
together so you want to make sure that
your beauty blender is a really damp or
your beauty sponge I don't care where
it's from or you better blend that face
today for concealer I'm trying a new
product now Kat Von D recently just put
out her new concealer these are the
Lockett concealers I got three shades
now of course you're like what the hell
is this this is called this is a pure
white one it's just called white out and
this is to mix or if you are
nikkietutorials this is probably the
best thing that was ever invented love
you bitch I also got light one and light
five these are the cool toned ones that
were the lightest for me I've never
tried this formula yet so let's hope and
pray it works I'm gonna take light one
which is still pretty light oh this
component is very cute it feels heavy
and I'm just gonna oh my god this is
really light this is what I like for
summer those that very Golden Girls
stark white under I know I was gonna add
in a dot of the white just for fun okay
well let's give that a whirl now I'm
going to take my very damp Beauty
Blender and get to blending
now we're gonna set these under eyes
with the new Kat Von D beauty brush this
is number 25 and we're gonna set this
with her new a locket setting powder now
you guys know I am so hardcore down for
my Chanel and the laura mercier so I'm
like okay let's try a new setting powder
it just says translucent so right now I
think there's only one shade any powders
now usually I use my damp Beauty Blender
so I'll just take it like that and then
we're just gonna kind of press it under
the eyes let's let that sit for a minute
now I'm going to take this brush and
just kind of set that concealer all
right now I'm going to take another
brush this is number 20 this is a bigger
version of the one I just showed you so
this is where I'm gonna dust my under
eye off all right today for contouring
I'm going to be using that makeup geek
contour powder in shade love triangle
this is on more of a warm side even
though I am cool toned I just want to be
a little more warm for summer and I'm
going to be using this little more feet
5 to 7 so good for doing contour and I'm
just going to start on them cheekbones
and it's like okay so how severely do I
want to cut you today because I'm
feeling really severe no I always like
to drag it on my temples and I like to
go really fast back and forth and it
just kind of blend into that jawline and
I'm going to drag it out just halfway so
I'm never going to go past it I'm just
going to stop here and feather it out
and then a quick little trick I like to
do with the nose is I'll just take a big
fan brush this was from makeup forever
and I dip into the pan once or twice get
a little bit of product on there and
I'll just take it and I'll go directly
down the nose and it's gonna give you
really quick instant contour BAM
come on blend bitch below that would to
give my cheeks a little extra I'm going
to be using that NARS orgasm blush now
I'm just going to use this little morphe
III brush and then I'm just going to
dust my cheeks just to give it that
extra little peachy glow I've been
staying away from blush but now that
summer is like officially here like I'm
going to change up my local
add in some color alright I am feeling
flaky now off-camera I'm gonna go draw
on some brows really quickly and I'll be
right back alright now let's get started
on these eyes to create that copper
smoky drama I'm gonna be using my Urban
Decay eye primer and I'm just gonna do a
low one to swipe now notice I did do a
different color on my eyebrows today
it's a little more operan color it
matches the pink and I might be blonde
at the end of this video but for now I
love I'm just loving the brows I'm just
taking a little flat synthetic brush and
we are going to blend that primer into
the lids now to start I'm going to be
dipping into my own brands palette this
is the beauty killer eyeshadow palette
and I'm going to be using two shades
today first one I'm going to be using is
China white and I'm going to take the
same brush and I'm just gonna do my brow
bone and highlight that now this is a
very natural light ivory color so I'm
just gonna press that into the skin and
then drag down this is going to help my
shadows blend later and just gives a
pretty little highlight now we're going
to take a little Mac 2 to 4 brush and
we're going to dip into a little
transition shade called Courtney and
we're just going to put that right in
our crease
oh right now notice how I am just kind
of dragging this out a little bit right
here just to give that a little illusion
so now that this is done being blended
we are going to add a little darkness in
here with some copper shades now before
I do anything else I'm going to go back
into Courtney and just do a little on my
lids and there we go
now to create that really dark copper
moment I'm gonna be using auto stop C at
Beverly Hills Sienna oh come on first of
all the pigments amazing so I'm really
gonna darken my lid and start to blend
that color out now everyone wanted to
know what I was wearing on my lids the
other day for that really wet metallic
look so before we dive into that I am
gonna leave a space right in here to put
that where I really don't need to put
eyeshadow and then for a little touch of
a little more cop Ernest I mean we need
more warmth to this space we're going to
be using Anasazi as a blazing eyeshadow
as well it's a little more redder than
Sienna and I'm just gonna put that in
here as well we're just mixing matching
today people
now that this is blended into perfection
I'm gonna be using the steel at
magnificent metals now this is what gets
that wet effect on your lids and this is
shade kitten now it comes with these
little dropper things you could mix to
make it like really crazy I'm gonna be
really country and just show you what I
do yes I just lick my own brush because
hi I'm putting it on myself
do not ever lick a brush and then put on
her clients eyes but if you're doing it
on yourself who the cares so I'm
just gonna take a little bit of this on
the bridge sole you see how wet that
looks using this dry it's alright
wetting it a tiny bit I mean do you
 say that
whoa this is the definition of bullying
bullying so the product is a little
tacky you do have to move it around with
the brush and then I'm just gonna drag
it down and fill in that blank space
that we talked about earlier that we did
not need any shadow for and then we're
just going to take a little bit more and
here's where I'll start to kind of thin
it out and there you have it come on now
now they have these in like like 30
shades just like looking at on my lid I
want to scream I am gonna add a tiny bit
of a liner now usually when I say tiny I
do full drag not today
Too Faced has these new eyeliner pens
out called sketch markers and I'm gonna
use this brown one this is called deep
espresso this is like a brown black like
this cute little packaging I love it
it's like no this is one of the felt
tips and you do need to shake it for a
second there are a million colors which
I thought was amazing now what does it
say inspired by Japanese calligraphy
pens flexible felt tip allows you to
create a paintbrush like stroke for
clean lines all right well I'm just
gonna dive right in here and just drag
it on the lash line so our lashes look
very pretty later I'm gonna do the
tiniest little wing and chalk you all
all right now to smoke out that bottom
lashline and get that really deep copper
effect I'm going to start out with my
Mac some older eyepencil and we're just
going to quickly do the entire waterline
now we're gonna smoke out that bottom
lash line and knees Anasazi at Beverly
Hills shadow in henna now this one is
like a deep copper and it has a lot of
bling to it so I'm gonna actually use
the liner to help me deepen and kind of
create a more smoky look and I'm just
going to start here with a pencil brush
and just lightly really lightly almost
like we're doing surgery go under the
black liner now to avoid any fallout
you're just gonna be really gentle and
go all the way across now I like to take
the brush and kind of drag some of that
black liner down and just kind of mix it
in I love how this is looking
I'm just gonna deepen this a little more
make it a little more pop in and we
should be good now I just bought this
new Gucci mascara
I'll keep this packaging is I'm like hey
there now this is the iconic black
mascara I've never tried this before
really cute packaging and ooh the one is
cute so I'm just gonna go in here and
see what happens
For Lashes today I'm going to be using
the House of lashes iconic these are so
gorgeous so I'm going to slap them on
and I'll be right back
lashes are done now let's get to
highlighting what are we going to do
today for highlighting in the video the
other day I used my own brand and mixed
two of them and they looked so pretty so
let's just dip in first I'm gonna be
using my own skin frost in shade peach
goddess I use this one all the time in a
morphe 510 a few swipes is all you need
so I'm just going to take this and hmm
woah put this on the high plains of my
cheekbones
now this highlighter does have a little
peach hue to it which looks really great
with all this warm toned makeup I have
going on today so we're just gonna use a
skinny we can do a little up here oh the
glow the watch now wouldn't be right
unless we got that Cupid's bow really
bright right now this is my favorite
part because when you take flash
pictures for Instagram it's like oh oh
hi there just looks really nice and then
of course we're gonna do it just a
little dot on the nose just so everyone
just like okay I see you today and I
you're probably asking me like okay
you're good now right please I'm
definitely gonna be using one more
highlighter now was about to mix ice
cold but then I remember to use this Mac
Daddy artist Couture powder this is the
diamond glow powder in shade yes and
this has a little peach tint to it like
to the color it's really pretty so I'm
just going to be dipping in with a
morphe fan brush and just because this
is a loose powder and we're just gonna
add this on top of peach goddess oh my
god there we go
mixing highlighters is like my new
addiction I'm like oh you know once cute
and all but ones never enough this just
gives it an extra like now I am glowing
so I think the only thing that we need
to finish off this look is all lit that
makes a statement before we do any
lipstick I am gonna dip into my own
spearmint a lip scrub because this
weather has been
so dry lately I'm like hi my lips are
not loving me so I'm a wipe off some of
that highlighter hit there K put more on
and I'm just gonna exfoliate in circular
motion and get up all this dead skin all
right let's wipe off the access and then
we'll be ready for lips today I'm going
to be using jawbreaker liquid lipstick
from my own brand I'm like hi I'm just
going to use all my today I haven't
done a blue lip in a minute my own brand
actually has four different shades this
one is back in stock finally for
everyone that's like where the is

lockdown we're glowing we're blinging
