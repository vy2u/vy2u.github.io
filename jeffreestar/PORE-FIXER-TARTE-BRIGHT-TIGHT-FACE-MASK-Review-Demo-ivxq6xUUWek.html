channel now if you are a skincare addict
you are going to enjoy today's video
because we are going to test out the
brand new Tarte tight and bright clay
multi mask now I've seen this all over
Instagram you know people always take
crazy map pictures and when I saw this I
was like oh my god it's a clay mask and
a gel mask in one and I want to see if
it works today so I have of course in no
makeup on my face I may have woken up
this morning with a little bit of
mascara right here but hey who doesn't
I'm just going to tone my face right now
and make sure there's no dirt and oil
but this mask looks really exciting so
if you want to see if it works or not
keep on watching alright so when you
unbox it it comes in this a large jar
now when I saw this on Instagram I had
no idea it was this big so this is
definitely bigger than like a normal
face mask jar I am going to compare it
to the glam glow dream duo only because
when you open it there were there was a
similarity that I've really never seen
before in face masks of course I don't
mean that in any type of way I just
definitely noticed that this Glanville
one I've tried before this is one of the
few masks I've seen with a like a duo
type of mask thing of course these
products are not similar in the way that
they work or what they're for but I
thought it was interesting but when you
compare like this to this you guys like
this is this is big I mean what are the
ounces though that's probably the realty
sometimes don't let size for you this
one only has I think 0.20 grams of more
product so anywho we are going to of
course test this out today now when you
open this up you guys can definitely see
love the colors for this you have the
I'm going to call it lavender I don't
think it's like a bit yeah this looks
lavender I think it's a lavender clay
mask and then you have this gold gel
mask so weird of course we're going to
go on the website and see what the hell
this is actually supposed to do because
I have no damn idea
so for $40 that is what this retails for
you are going to
would get 0.88 ounces so it is almost a
full ounce but not quite and of course
there are two different masks in this
thing so on the website let's pull up
Sephora home shall we
this says you guys it is for normal oily
combination dry sensitive it's literally
for everyone and this mask is vegan
which is awesome they are both are so
basically you're supposed to mix match
and target skin concerns by tightening
pores polishing hydrating and
brightening Grum always down for a
fucking brightening please this is going
to solve our poor areas it is going to
help with dryness dullness and uneven
texture girls like my whole life has an
uneven texture okay so basically this is
a custom at-home facial with to target
formulas that work in a total harmony to
create your skin specific troubles zone
by zone both the formulas feature tarts
iconic Amazonian clay to restore a
gentle skin balance okay so what the
hell does the purple lavender one do it
detoxifies and purifies the face it is
perfect for oily t-zone and shine
control and it's going to help tighten
pores detox your skin oh wow it's a lot
okay now the gold one is a hydrating and
firming gel mask ideal for dry or
delicate areas like the cheeks and under
eyes it is going to calm redness and
inflammation so if someone sits on your
face for more than 10 minutes I want to
use this and then it basically is going
to boost my clarity and circulation and
supposed to restore my skin's and
natural moisture balance for a supple
soft and energized look well I think
it's time to apply this bad boy so what
I want to do is of course I've been
running around this morning I'm a bit on
the treadmill I'm a bit on my knees so I
am going to take this fresh rose deep
hydration facial toner and how cool does
this look with the rose petals inside I
think it looks so cool now this is going
to just really leave the skin calming
and prep it for a face mask so I love to
use these little cotton circles and I
just pour a little bit on here and just
remove all
excess oil that I have accumulated
throughout the day
now before I applied a mask I always put
on eye cream right before because I
never put masks fully up to of course
the lash line your skin around your eyes
is a very sensitive it's a lot more
delicate than the rest of the skin on
your face so I'm going to go in with the
tatcha deep hydration firming eye serum
I love this because it has this clay
applicator and it just feels really
cooling when you put it on so I'd love
to just let the eye cream settle in and
then apply the mask how to it says to
apply the purple mask wherever you want
to tighten pores and minimize shine
apply the gold mask where I want to
hydrate so it says to leave on for 10 to
20 minutes and then rinse well I'm sure
with a warm washcloth to remove it all
so I have to face masks brushes here
that I use whenever I apply face masks
do you need a face mask brush I mean I
want to apply all that with my fingers
so yes you do alright so for purple we
want to tighten and minimize the shine
so we were going to take this the clay
one is like thick I love it and let's
put it in our t-zone area and a little
on the pores
now we're going to go into the gold side
and we're going to put this where we
want to brighten in where I'm just
feeling a little dull so basically all
over my body and I'm just going to oh
wow
when I saw the gold metallic I wasn't
sure what it was going to feel like it
is very gel like it is not this is not a
metallic peel off this is definitely a
very gel like feeling now it feels kind
of cooling I'm just going to avoid where
I put the eye cream all right so the
mask is all on the face now I'm a weirdo
where I like to take some of the product
and do a little bit like on my neck area
I mean hi who wants their neck to age or
look old not this bitch and I'm going to
let this sit for 15 minutes and I will
be right back alright you guys we are 5
minutes and I'm actually zoom in on my
face a little bit here now obviously I
don't think this is a negative because
it's a face mask and it like a lot of my
other clay masks crack but you could
tell when I was going like mm-hmm
girl I look like I'm in Lord of the
Rings right now all right you guys so it
has been 15 minutes I'm going to run to
the sink which is behind this camera and
I'm going to wash this off but I do want
to say that this feels really hard like
my pores better looks a little different
after this because this feels like
really hard clay look at that woo girl
it's look at its cracking oh look at
that
woo and then this oh it kind of dried
yeah I did dry look you guys it really
did huh where's all my finger oh my god
if I owned dry skin in case anyone was
wondering great so I need some lotion
and it's off be right back alright you
guys so I'm going to quickly do a little
zoom in on my face right now the gold
part of the mask came off really easy
the clay mask it did dissolve with hot
water please ignore my inspected pour I
know you guys are like what the fuck oh
I've sugar on my mouth come on lip scrub
I do have I didn't have a break out here
you guys saw that when I try to
the Laura Mercier foundation girl it's
like still here I'm like boom but um so
there was a little bit of redness here
where the clay was barely though I mean
that's kind of normal with some masks
now let's see if my pores look any
different that's going to be the real
question so I'm just going to take a
compact here okay so I'm looking at my
face and I'll be really honest I really
don't see that much of a difference for
my pores like at all obviously you know
sometimes you do need to use masks
several times but just from like the
very first initial like wiping it off
like my pores look pretty much the same
now my skin does feel nice where the
gold is it kind of feels like a little
bit of a texture you guys see the shine
that's happening right here definitely
did something to my skin so it feels a
little more like I feel something I may
be and then your pores look any
different I gotta ask the person that
Facebook's me every day yeah how do you
look pretty much what do you think a
real normal real quickly so tight I
think the honest they look the same size
to me yeah I mean I didn't didn't go
anywhere
hahahaha alright thanks baby I mean if
you stare at me everyday I just really
had to ask really quick yeah let me you
like you baby thank you okay you guys so
I definitely don't like to approve skin
care if it isn't like a quick fix or
something that you have to use over time
I don't really think it's fair I think
that the mask is fun
I love base maps in general it's always
fun to just like let your skin have a
moment and it kind of is almost like a
psychological thing where you're like oh
my god maybe my pores are her tighten
maybe they are to me looking in the
mirror in front of me I don't see that
much of a difference my skin is a little
red still and it's been like ten minutes
so that hopefully that goes away you can
also see kind of like red splotchiness
right here who knows what that is doing
is it extracting is it doing something I
guess we will have to see I will leave
my final thoughts in the description box
now let you know what happened later
that night to see if the redness is
still there I'm soon
no but hey you never want to assume yeah
you guys I think that when it comes to
skin care there's not going to be a
Jeffrey Stehr approved moment unless it
is something that I can really know if
it works right away so I don't think
that that's fair
so the tart type and bright face mask
was cool actually kind of like the gold
more the clay was almost like too hard
it almost like I didn't hurt but it was
like really intense more than usual so
my skin is like girl give me some damn
moisture okay I guess we are done for
this video thank you guys so much for
watching another one of my crazy first
impressions and of course I'll see you
on the next one mwah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
