channel you see something different I
recently just shot the new makeup ad for
my shade and drogyny now that liquid
lipstick
I've never gotten a response in the
entire year that my brand has been
around that shade is just like exploded
all over the internet and there was even
a petition on beauty list to bring it
back so of course I can never say no to
you guys androgyny will be coming back
in February of 2016 so I recently shot
the ad for that and I had my hairdresser
do a few wigs for me so I'm playing
around having some fun I recently cut
off my hair a few months ago and I do
miss it so I'm gonna be changing up my
hair a lot trying new things trying
things out girl today we're gonna do a
full glam purple smokey eye with a nude
lip and bitch we're gonna glow to the
 gods so if you want to see how
to create this crazy mess
keep watching before I do any my bright
eye shadows I'm going to prime my eyes
with a Kat Von D high-voltage eye primer
and I'm just going to be using some Mac
two by two brush to apply it a dot
covers your entire lid so do not overuse
this product and I like to take a little
primer from the excess of the brush and
just kind of sweep it under my eyes all
right let's get started with the eye
shadow as always I'm going to take a
really light eyeshadow and put it from
the brow all the way to my lash line and
today I'm gonna be using this really
white color it is like pure coke and
this is from that visi art 0-8 editorial
palette I love this one if you've never
tried this brand bitch you missing out
because this blends alike coffee
cream now you all know I like to go all
the way to the brow bone so as I get up
top I'm gonna blend out this shade
all right now let's move on to some
purples now to start off I'm going to be
using makeup geeks high-wire with this
Mac 219 brush now I love these pointed
brushes because they easily get in the
corners so I'm going to just start
packing it on the bottom corner and on
the top let's dampen this a little bit
okay what's up silver and I am just
gonna pack and pack and pack this on
alright now it's time to start adding in
the purple we're going to start laying
down the foundation of our purple eye
with Caitlin rose now I love to saturate
my brush completely before I start and
then I'll knock out fallout ahead by now
I'm gonna bring this purple all the way
down to the lash line just a little bit
here it kind of creates a seat like
movement all right now we're gonna
soften these harsh edges on the top
we're going to be dipping into
masquerade eyeshadow now I'm just going
to take this on the brush and I'm gonna
go over what I've already done and just
start dragging it up so it just gives
you that more airbrushed appearance and
really nice soft blending notice how I
am bringing it a little bit down on my
nose now I'm gonna go back with that
light color from this palette and I'll
be going back and forth and just
blending and buffing it out until it
looks super airbrushed
now I'm going to be taking max smolder
eyepencil and I'm going to be just
putting black in my waterline and we're
going to use that to pop down and mix
the purple shadow so we get that really
grungy smoky eye we're going to take the
Beauty Blender we're gonna lightly just
pull really light you guys now this does
not have to be perfect as we are going
to blend over it basically so as long as
the waterline looks good you're good
alright now let's start putting some
purple shadow under the eyes now I'm
going to be using this Tom 4:14 eyes
shadow brush and we're going to be
mixing in Caitlin rose from makeup geek
with the busy art shade down here now
this is like a purple with a little red
undertone I love it I'm going to dip it
up first then we're going to go back in
here and we're going to dip in so my
brush basically has two colors on it I
am just going to start buffing and
dragging this over the black liner and
using it just smudge it out and create
some purple amazingness now I'm even
going over a little bit of the silver
just so it mixes in with the purple so
it stays looking really smoked out but
then as the purple effect to it and now
I'm going to take that same Mac to 2 or
blending brush and we're just going to
take it a little bit on here get rid of
that fallout and I'm just going to put
it right under the eye and blend and mix
those together so it looks really
airbrushed now I'm using a lot of purple
I'm trying to get my eyes to look
exactly like promethazine coating makes
it Barney having five children
voila now to create some dimension in my
lids because I do have deep set eyes I'm
going to be taking makeup geeks
eyeshadow in drama-queen
with this morphe five one for brush and
we are just going to add a hint of
darkness in my crease just right in
there I'm just going to tuck it in
nothing too crazy but I do like to give
it a little more
like Hello alright let's put on some
lashes before I put on my lashes as
always I'm gonna be using my Too Faced
better than sex mascara to coat the top
and bottom for lashes today I'm going to
be using league lychees 3d style in
Monaco I love these they are really full
really dramatic we're just gonna paint
on some glue and we're gonna wait for
them to get a little tacky wave our
hands like we just don't ok lashes I
love obvious look for highlight today
I'm going to be using that morphe m3 10
fan brush I love this this is really
nice to just chisel I'm going to be
using Mac Daddy's artist couture line
and this shade is called the gold digger
so as usual I'm gonna put this right
above my contour and in between my
highlight and I'm just gonna pack the
song oh this is vicious now usually I
would take my highlight and put a little
bit under the brow but I want to stay
really matte here and really glossy here
so I'm just going to take someone do it
right on my Cupid's bow and we're just
going to do a little bit down under the
nose now that we are shining bright like
a diamond I am ready for the lips her
lips I'm gonna be using my own below our
liquid lipstick from my line and the
shade is called posh spice this is a
really nice nude it's a very grey base
like taupe and grey mixed together and I
think it's perfect for we have bright
hair bright eyes let's tone it down a
little bit
and do a nice nude lip
lips are officially done and now I'm
going to set my face with the Urban
Decay all nighter setting spray and I'm
ready
this look is complete and I love it I
love purple I love color I really wish
my hair was really this color so I'm
gonna have to see what we could loo
