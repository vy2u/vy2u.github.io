channel today we are going to highlight
our whole bodies are assholes or cheeks
our mouths our lips our eyes or a
hairline we're going to highlight for
the cause asshole where does it come
from I mean I'm going to highlight it
there is a new highlighter that has been
out for a few months I have been dying
to try it it has been referred to as the
putty highlighter has a crazy texture
and its really blinding allegedly do my
friends have tried it out here in the
YouTube realm and I'm like you know what
it's time that I try it so today we're
going to be talking about the Stila
heavens hue highlighter comes in a
gorgeous gold a unit carton you all know
I love Stella I'm wearing it on my lids
right now this glitter is the
Magnificent metals glitter and glow eye
shadow uh-huh come on QVC commercial no
but these are unreal and I'm obsessed
with them they've been in favorite
videos you've seen them on my tutorials
now Cielo is back with something new and
I am dying to try it so let's open her
app when you open it up it comes in this
gorgeous a little compact and it has the
shade name on the back I got two shades
because there's only three and one of
them was like a really topaz and the
other two were more kind of iridescent
so I got kitchen and transcendence can
you open them up they come with a little
protector like a little plastic thing so
you can do away with that
now this compact is really pretty I just
wish it was like a little heavier I love
like really heavy things this feels a
little drugstore which is not bad by any
means but it does still really liked
when you open it up of course you do get
a mirror with it which I love and the
price for these retail is a $32 and if
you go on the website it gives you a
bunch of tips and tricks of how to use
it so of course we're going to read
those so let me show you guys the other
shade so of course this is kitten it
looks like a beautiful champagne color
and then we have a trend send
and it looks like this I did already
touch it with my finger on accident so
you're going to see a little fingerprint
in there but this one looks to me more
like a purpley light pink lavender type
of thing we'll see in a second so for
$32 you get this guy and you get 0.35
ounces which is basically 10 grams of
products of pretty good for a
highlighter now on the website it says
that this is allegedly going to be a
natural-looking radiance
enhancing highlighter with a unique
texture and a barely-there feel it is
supposed to melt into the skin for a
weightless feel ultra fine light
diffusing particles help skin look lit
from within with a soft luminous natural
looking glow I'm like natural okay I'm
still going to try it that word is a
little weird
now it does say shade descriptions which
I find interesting
so kitten the champagne one it says it's
Steelers iconic shimmering nude pink
which will brighten and illuminate and
this one transcendence is an opulent
pink for a bolder Easter roll glow okay
cool so basically I'm like how the hell
am I supposed to apply this I just want
to touch it before we even apply that's
kind of my goal so I'm just going to
take clean fingers right here and I'm
just going to press into it oh it's
almost like oh look at my fingerprint
you guys holy shit it does have that
like weird type of like click clay or
something okay so you guys could tell it
is a crazy I'm gonna do two fingers like
let's just push in there I'm like do I
want to break it huh whoa look at that
whoo okay I'm like how the hell are you
even supposed to apply this so let's
look on their website because I'm like
I'm shook am I going to kind of cracked
it a little bit okay so you guys can see
you can push on it and move it and then
like move it back whoa okay so a
suggested usage how the hell are we
supposed to use this it says apply with
a sponge or a dent stippling brush okay
got one of those or fingers blend onto
cheeks eyes and
can be a worn alone on bare skin or over
foundation well mama is wearing a lot of
foundation today
no no shocker here so we're going to try
it against every which way I kind of
want to go in with my finger and just
see what the hell happens okay so we
have a clean finger here let's swirl it
around whoa it just feels like really
weird it almost reminds me of the Kylie
cosmetics wet set but hers actually felt
like hold on I got her right here y'all
got it right here hers actually felt
like almost cooling to the touch where
this one is the more like Airy like it
feels a lighter if that makes sense so
let's just swirl it around I'm going to
go in on my bare skin right now let's
see what happens
oh okay is anyone seeing what I'm seeing
like oh okay let me just buff that into
my skin it feels so weird to use my
finger but the finger worked really well
as you guys can see
wow that's pretty let me slow it around
a little more oh my god look at that you
guys like a little mirror on my cheek
it's just sitting there like hey whoa
I'm like going in for the close-up like
this is really pretty
that definitely matches my lipstick girl
look at that cheekbone it's like glowing
for life if you didn't pay your
electricity bill just open up the
compact apply and bam problem solved
okay obviously this applied very well
with my fingers I do want to take a
brush for fun and make sure the products
on there and we clean or clean so this
is a little Kevin of Kwan highlighting
brush this can be used for powders for
creams for really anything and I really
love it so it said a dense little brush
this is definitely a dense brush and I'm
just going to swirl this around oh it
coated it instantly
so obviously I'm gonna have to
cheekbones or what else could we try on
my face you guys we can do a little bit
of nose we can do the chin I'll just go
on my chin like it's an alien fish craft
and then we will take this and just do
maybe the little bit of a nose oh my god
so obviously if you want a more natural
look you can take a damp Beauty Blender
or even your finger and just kind of
buff it out for those of you that do not
love you really really crazy crazy glow
you definitely can just use this and
make it more subtle if you will I think
subtlety is not
we don't like subtlety on this channel
I'm like a little shocked at how like
quick that shit worked hmm let's try the
other shade all right now let's try the
champagne shade kitten I think it looks
so pretty I'm already gonna guess that
it's going to be a little even more
blinding than this one because it's not
like a straight-up like metallic feel to
it so of course I'm going to touch it
with my finger yeah it's like when you
go to the police station and they ask
for your fingerprint that's kind of what
it looks like that's what I would know
that let's try this cheek I'm just going
to take a little hair clip and push her
back as I can and then I'm going to I
mean I guess we can do our fingers again
this shit fucking work last time I'm not
really about using fingers on your face
depending on the context but let's give
it a whirl so we have our clean fingers
now we have our clean fingers and I'm
just going to swirl this around Oh oh-ho
okay Stila look at that blinding rose
gold color I'm like a little shook right
now okay so let's just go in whoa it
like glides on to the skin so easy I
don't know what it is but this applies
like really easy I'm going to take the
pigment off of your last color and then
I'm going to go in on this brush again
just for fun this is really pretty it
gives you that kind of like sweaty
extreme highlighter type of glow and I
love it I think of course if you want to
tone it down you could take it and tone
it down but I could I'll live or how it
looks now I do want to take this and
maybe do a little bit on my Cupid's bow
without getting lip gloss all over
myself okay you're a little trickier
ones you have gloss on in this mouth
girl okay you guys the only place else I
could think to put it is like maybe my
body just for fun so I'll just take a
little bit of my collarbone maybe okay
it says put on the body so let's do that
oh wow okay I don't know how it's really
showing up on camera but in person when
I'm looking at this I'm like oh okay so
like bling bling alright you guys I'm a
little shocked at how easy like they
apply it it was very like oh and then
looking back right now on this side it
was definitely really really blinding
like watch this one Mord
on my finger it is like really blinding
but I think because it's really close to
my actual skin tone it's not I mean
though that's pretty bright its blinding
it may not look as wild as this one
because this in this course is lighter
than my natural skin tone and this one
kind of like blends and I'm like okay I
know the answer that everyone is already
going to be waiting for and you guys
already know you guys just watch this I
am a pleasantly surprised and shocked at
how well these applied I am going to beg
Stila make more colors the formula is
really pretty it glided on really nice
it was soft I mean it has pigment I love
how it looks it's very Airy almost live
like nothing's on my skin which I love
because momma already has a lot of full
coverage foundation powder concealer
contour so adding on something else it
just kind of weighs you down it's always
kind of like but I am really happy I am
pleasantly shocked at how well it just
worked I'm like oh okay
alright I think you guys are already
going to know the answer to this but the
Stila heavens hue highlighter is
Geoffrey star approved these are really
great I think they're fun $32 not too
bad now I think that Stila is like one
of those top tiers so for brands that
can definitely price their makeup a
little more pricey than others and the
formula really worked I'm like wow I
love brands that just try new things and
new formulas and just new innovation I'm
here for and I love it so Congrats do it
