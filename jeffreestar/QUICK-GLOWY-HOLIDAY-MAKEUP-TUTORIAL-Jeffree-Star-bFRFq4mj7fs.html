channel now today I'm doing a little
soft easy holiday look if we can call
this holiday I think we can it's holiday
season baby I really can't even get over
the fact that like my birthday
Thanksgiving it's over like December is
here and I honestly can't believe it so
I thought it'd be fun to do something a
little different let's tone down the
craziness for the week and just do
something that's just really like soft
and gentle you know and something that's
really quick so this is a quick easy
holiday look the eye look is so minimal
but I'm loving it I'm looking in the
monitor like oh my god it actually
cannot believe that I like myself um
with this amount of makeup on usually
you all know I'd wear 20 more pilots and
ten more highlighters but I'm like you
know what let's just scale it down and
do something that everyone could easily
recreate so today we're gonna be diving
into this little craziness so if you
want to see how I got all this together
then keep on watching
alright so I'm gonna use a new primer
today I'm like okay we got so many new
products that's just even happened this
year I am overwhelmed but the brand of
Burberry which I love their clothing but
they also have a beauty line which is
very underrated and I've used their
highlighters a lot but they have this
new holiday primer now this is called
the fresh glow luminous fluid base on my
girl it comes in this beautiful gorgeous
gold packaging with their famous plaid
and this is a makeup primer and it comes
in a little bottle like this and now I
used it once when I went out the other
day and I liked a lot so I think we're
gonna give her a little spin today and
see how it looks on camera so let's just
rub this all over and see what happens
oh it does have like a little bit of
like almost shimmer in it alright so
we're just gonna make sure this is all
settled in now for foundation today this
look is very easy like especially for me
sometimes I go really in this is going
to be a release just soft pretty moment
today so Pro Foundation I don't want
anything like too too cakey I know
that's kind of shocking to everybody but
I think
just gonna go in with I keep using this
you guys the lemare soft fluid it is so
pretty I just I can't stop using it so
we're just gonna give her a few pumps
now this one is kind of medium to full
coverage but it just looks really real
so if you're someone that wants a lot of
coverage but you're like girl it's way
to take you for me I think this is going
to be perfect for you and of course I'm
going to dot this all over and what do
we do next
we're gonna buff and bounce all right
now this skin is already feeling
snatched that primer made this
foundation even better I feel like I'm
like looking the mirror like whoa okay
very skin-like okay now moving on
concealer I'm gonna be going in with my
Tarte shape and tape which I love this
is one of my favorites and I'm just
going to dot it all around the under
eyes today now with the artiste oval
seven brush we are going to blend
all right this concealer is blended out
like mmm now quickly before the under
eyes try to play me we're gonna take
some Chanel setting powder and we're
just going to Pat that under our eyes
the someone's dropped everywhere so
we're just going to take this now I like
to take the little sponge in here of
course if you want to use a brush you
definitely can and I'm just gonna Pat
this under my eyes and let it so in for
a minute this is gonna make sure that
our under eyes do not crease oh yes
and it almost makes your pores kind of
like disappear so we're going to take
that on our chin as well and then dot a
little bit on the nose besides that what
else do we need to do we're not even
done setting the under eyes so you all
need to just have a seat we're gonna
take the of course Mac Shivering white
Studio Fix and with a little JD weighty
Alexi brush we're gonna and we're gonna
extra set the under eye and I'm just
taking this and I'm not just kind of
like swiping it around I'm actually like
packing it into the skin which is
something I've been doing for a long
time and it just makes the foundation
last longer throughout the day and make
sure that it doesn't move around all
right we are set and blended this is the
one eight six brush it's an old-school
match brush and it's perfect for packing
on foundation powders so we're going to
take another color of Studio Fix this is
NW 18 and we are going to a lot of
product comes off we're just going to
pack that into the skin avoiding where
we really highlighted of course and
we're going to do the entire neck hi
grandma was dirty girl
and once again you guys can see I'm like
packing this into the skin I'm not just
like maybe I'm like going in now time to
contour now for contour today we're
going to be using it be morphe 9c
palette this one is really good for
everyday use she comes in a variety like
this and I love to dip into this guy and
this guy just kind of makes and today
we're gonna be using a little Chanel
powder brush bambam now I'm gonna go a
little lower than I normally do and
we're just gonna sculpt this face really
really sharp today like do we have any
issues today you want to go on the
parking lot I have a
oh man and now I'm gonna go in with a
little more p3 and I like to go to this
top shade I'm gonna bring this up into
the hairline I just kind of sculpt
around my face and get that really
bronzy pretty look going all right now
to really snatch that forehead I'm
adding in a lot today because we're
really going to focus on skin contour
and highlight I'm using this makeup
forever brush because it just gets a big
area really quickly and it just blends
nicely so I'm going to go a little
darker than usual on the forehead if
you're afraid of that you do not have to
do it this dark but I like to play
around sometime you don't always have to
do your same routine switch it up
feeling wrong now I'm definitely going
to do the nose quickly now what I mean
by that is I like to take this and I
like to press my hands like this so we
make it even more and then I'm gonna
barely touch the pan okay now we're just
gonna go right down so if you want to
contour your nose in a flash and really
quickly just go down and go to ten girl
right now we're gonna take a little more
feet III again and go into that lightest
shade we're just gonna kind of go over
the jaw and soften her a little bit so
it's not so harsh I'm just trying to
have a moment today so we're just also
gonna take that powder again and we're
just going to go over the contour on the
forehead with it and just kind of soften
it so it's not too severe gonna go over
that nose a bit so we're not like too
crazy because it's hard to breathe right
now we are contoured now I'm gonna
quickly do some brows off-camera if you
want to see how I draw them on I will
put a link in the description box down
below so I'll be right back alright now
this eye look is probably one of the
most easiest I have ever done in my
channel so we're gonna take a little Mac
painterly paint-pot and we're just gonna
coat our entire lids with that really
quickly and just kind of give our eyes
second primer now the foundation in a
concealer that is on my lids is
definitely enough but is it now for
eyeshadow get ready for this one because
it is a really simple I'm gonna pull out
my little busy art palette I love this
guy
is it's been through a lot it's been
through some a lot of traveling
definitely broke this months ago it's
hanging on a thread right now people but
it's okay because guess what
it still works so I'm sure you can see
right here this is one of my favorite
shade it just hit pan the other day and
it is the perfect like ivory bone white
color to put all over your lids and I
like to take this and put it from my
brow bone all the way down and it just
gives you a really lifted look and this
is also gonna help that crease color
blend effortlessly all right the base is
laid down alright so this look is it's
almost done actually I know that's kind
of shocking so I'm gonna take a little
blending brush any blending brush that
you want will suffice and I'm going to
pull out the beauty killer palette now
the shade Courtney girl this is the tea
and the truth so we're just gonna go
into her for a second now this is where
it gets really easy so the other day
when I posted that look I literally just
took this brush and I had like 20
minutes to get ready before I went
somewhere and I was like you know what I
was gonna be really really soft and
pretty today and see what happens which
is scary cuz me me toning it down
takes a lot out of me so I took it and I
literally went all the way in we're
talking just right there so it even
though like makes your nose thinner by
the way it's a little trick I've been
doing forever you just got a flick up
and blend this crease color into the
white shadow that you just laid down now
this is where you can stop it here you
can go out more I like to take it and
even put it on my lash line and lit a
little bit so it almost like hugs it I
mean if this is not the most simple eye
I've ever done girl get ready and then
you're gonna go back in with that shade
one more time and you're just gonna put
in a little bit more in to the crease
and voila we are like there you could
stop here now I always say this if you
want to add more you definitely can but
if you really want to stop here it's
okay but I am gonna add in just a little
bit of dimension to my lids so I'm gonna
go in with shade vanity it is a dark
like blackened plum color and I'm just
going to go in with a little detailer
brush and I'm just gonna lightly barely
put some into my crease just so my lids
have like some X
drama so I'm gonna go back in with the
blending brush and just take it and
soften it so there's no extra powder
again on any of the brushes we're just
gonna really just make the lid have a
little Ojai so it's not so flat all
right now to make your eyes pop a little
bit we're going to take a little
fascinating white liner from Matt we're
just gonna take that Beauty Blender have
it lightly pull down our waterline and
then we're gonna pack in that white
liner and turn into a tall BAM okay cool
now it's time for a little bit of
mascara no no shocker here I'm going to
be going in with my benefit or roller
lash and we're gonna coat our entire top
and bottom lashes and this is really
going to make this look pop and look
just really elegant and slightly alright
let's put this on
now for blush today I'm going to be
using the new NARS unfiltered - look at
that pink packaging it's like a pink
mirrors so pretty
and it comes with six shades um oh hi I
see myself What's Up Girl hi yes okay so
I'm gonna go in with the new morphe
y5 brush these are all gold chrome I'm
like okay so I'm gonna go in with this
guy right here what's the name on the
back you better like look on the back
she's called fame okay that's cute BAM
and we're just going to these are
pigmented I should probably chill out
I'm just gonna lightly just a little
just on the apples of the cheeks to give
my face a little more color and warmth
mmm it's nothing too crazy it just gives
your face a little extra like flavor if
you will alright now let's
highlight because I forgot I wanted to
do blush today BAE um now I think for
this look I want to stay in like the
peaches and the gold realms so I'm
probably gonna do something blinding
alright now I'm gonna go in with the new
Mac extra dimension skin finish this is
in shade show gold and I'm gonna use the
new little more feet why 14 brush for
highlighting today and we're just going
to go in here now I've never used this
before
um I use it in my inner corner highlight
but not on the cheek so let's see what
happens oh oh I love that like pink
undertone it's pretty this really
reminds me of the pink heart shade in
the Anastacio moonchild um glow kit like
we're talking a really similar now this
definitely is not blinding enough it
looks really pretty but I feel like my
face needs a little bit more like ah
like the wow factor so let me just put
this on now on top I'm gonna go in with
my Mac Daddy artist Couture highlighting
powder this is in shade cocoa bling now
this I'm gonna use a little more if you
brush of course this is the morphe fan
310 brush and I'm just going to oh my
god this is like this is the blinding
effect that I need every single day so
let's um see what happens let's see if
there's a difference I'm sorry
what oh my god yes it just makes your
face look like almost like wet
King which is like mmm all right now I'm
quickly gonna do the Cupid's bow like oh
hi and then we're gonna do the little
tip of my nose like this is so pigmented
I'm just gonna like kind of massage it
in all right there we go I feel a little
bit more like myself I'm like maybe
doing a whole mat look I don't know if I
can even pull that off because I'm
 so shocked and scared I'm not
glowing okay I have a little bit better
now it's time for the lips all right now
for lips today I'm gonna be going in
with my own of a lower liquid lipstick
in shade chrysanthemum this is from the
holiday collection and I just love this
it's really soft and pretty and if you
don't want to do a crazy bold lip or not
even a stick anyone to last all day
definitely do a liquid lip so let's go
in alright this lipstick is dry I love
it it's so like just soft and like very
unjust are like but um I'm living for it
so besides that I need some
mother-effing setting spray now well I
want to keep this look very dewy and
very soft so I'm gonna be using my
armani
Prima setting spray and we're going to
mix it with a little touch of luminous
dewy skin mist so let's get our engines
ready and on the count of three one two
let's set and then we're gonna
do some more yeah c'est la vie alright
baby
this face is set and this look is
complete now toning it down for me is a
little hard I don't know if I can turn
down any more than this but I'm really
liking it I think it's different a
softer side of Miss star I'm loving it I
think this is a really cool for the
holidays it's quick and easy kind of
