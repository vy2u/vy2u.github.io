sit here and turn on the camera and talk
to you guys about some really serious
subjects some issues that I have been
dealing with for a long time and just
have a one on one with you guys this
video is something that I feel like I
owe to my entire audience through the
last ten years I have lived my life on
social media which is really crazy to
think about it's been a really long
journey from being a little musician on
a little website to my career now and as
I sit here I realized that I have a
bigger platform sometimes than I realize
myself and there are millions of people
out there that watch me that know about
my life that follow my story and I feel
like it's time that I get out a little
bit more of my story and this video is
mainly about something that is a really
 up subject that I've had to dealt
with for a long time and it concerns old
videos that were filmed of me twelve
years ago now I want to go on the record
and say that I know there's a lot of
people out there that love and support
me there are millions of you that watch
my videos that are out there and that
support me but there is also other
people out there that do not like me and
that's okay if you do not like what I'm
about if you hate me if you despise me
if you're not into what I'm about you do
not need to watch this but I would
really appreciate if you could listen to
my story and what I have to say with an
open mind and I think from human being
to human being YouTube all the
 the makeup everything that
we are so consumed with past all the fun
tutorials past everything I want to
speak to you as a human being that
breathes on this earth with you and
lately not lately for the last few years
as I have joined the YouTube community I
have been definitely subjected to a lot
of drama and I get it you know I am a
hot topic I have always been outspoken I
am
you know someone that looks different
and I realized that with all of that is
going to come the negative obviously the
positive is so unreal but the negative
can be very very dark and ugly and every
time that I get into an online and you
know conflict or confrontation or some
crazy feud whether it's with my ex best
friend or celebrity or other youtubers a
lot of stuff from my past constantly
gets dragged up it's been happening for
years in these videos I say some really
disgusting vile nasty and embarrassing
things and you know it's up the
past can never be erased it is always
going to be there and my past has been
recorded it's been video it has been
exploited all over the internet and I'm
sitting here and those videos were
twelve years ago and I look at them and
I see them resurface and it just makes
me sick to my stomach because I don't
know who that person was
I know who I am today I know exactly the
person I am today but I do not know who
that person was the person that said
those horrible vile things
that person was depressed that person
was just angry at the world that person
felt like they were not accepted that
person was seeking attention I was
someone that loved to seek attention
when I was younger I loved the shock
value I love fighting anger with anger
and I didn't know any better and does
that make it okay absolutely not I want
to look everyone in the eyes and let you
know that everything that you have seen
is so just wrong it's upsetting it's
nasty it really makes me sick to my
stomach to watch those old videos
because what I was saying is not what I
represent I think that racism is a very
serious subject especially in today's
world I'm embarrassed as a person
because that is not what I've ever stood
for I am all about self-expression
self-worth self-love and I think it's
also that you guys have to seem
not light because I don't ever want that
to take away the message that I have
always been about so I want to sit here
and I have talked about this before on
myspace back in the day I have addressed
this on snapchat I have talked about
this on Twitter in the past but that is
not good enough because for everyone out
there that supports me that believes in
me I owe you the truth
and I owe you an apology I am so sorry
for my words I am so sorry for
everything that I've said in my past I
can never turn back time and take those
moments away they happened I have owned
up with them and I have lived with it
for a long time
and every time that they get read rag
dup it just makes me just sad because I
don't know who that person was I think
it's really important to share that
growing up I I've always been a guy in
makeup I started wearing makeup in tenth
grade and the world was not how it is
today ten years ago there were no guys
and makeup on YouTube there was no men
and makeup parading the streets there
was no people like me and I was very
alone and I was also fearless I did not
care that the world was not accepting me
I knew that I loved makeup I know why I
was attracted to makeup I come from a
family of chaos alcoholism and abuse and
when I discovered makeup that was my
happy place I got to go and go playing
makeup for hours and escape the horrible
reality that was my life and my shitty
 parents and my crazy upbringing
and you know ten years ago when I left
the house I wish it was like today I
think that people don't realize how it
really was and I would leave the house
and people would spit on me they would
scream at me they would scream
freak and they would degrade me every
single day and what did I do
I fought back with rage and looking back
I am 31 years old now and looking back
at that person who had just graduated
high school who had turn 18 turn 19 and
then was just out to the world I was
emotionally abused every time but I
the house people did not accept me I
would be walking down the street people
would scream out their car every
single day I felt like a piece of
so what did I do
I spot back with anger I fought back
with rage and it's wrong I want to set
an example for the youth and the future
in front of me and I want to go on
record and let you know that that is not
okay just to get someone insults you it
is not okay to fight back but sometimes
that's how we handle things we're human
beings and I think that at the end of
the day people forget pass the money the
cars the clothes I am just one tiny
little person on this earth trying to
make a better life for me and my family
and I am nowhere near perfect I am
literally the furthest thing from
perfect I make mistakes every day but I
learned from them and the intent behind
my words back then it was not about race
racism does not live inside of me I
don't even know what the like I
don't know how that exists into people I
said really horrible vicious things back
to people to hurt them to harm them to
shock them and to let them know that you
you're going to call me something I'm
going to cut you back so hard and make
you feel like a piece of because
you made me feel low and that is not
okay it is not okay to fight words with
words like that and I have been subject
to a lot of stuff recently the last two
years has been so difficult it's also
been such a blessing I've never had this
much success in my career and all of you
out there that have supported me like I
will never be able to thank you enough
for the gift you have given me but I
also think that it's really important to
share things and let you know that I'm
not perfect I'm wrong all the time you
know and even recently when people were
saying some up to me or
trying to you know get a reaction
I do give in I am weak I am weak I'm
selfish I have anger problems sometimes
I lash out when people lash out at me
still to this day when someone wants to
try me or start something I'm the first
one that's like what bitch what you want
to try me let's go I've called people
stupid I called people rats I'd call
people annoying
I've called people every
in the book when they attack me back
because it's hard not to react sometimes
and I think that people forget you know
maybe once in a while the average person
will hear an insult but when you are
online the bullying and the extreme hate
that can come your way it is really hard
to deal with it is hard to log on and
every day there are people saying you're
great and then there's people telling
you you're an AZ message and you
look like the horse and you
should kill yourself those are things
that I have to read every day and
mentally process them as okay this is
how someone feels about me great can I
you know lose sleep every night worrying
about it no I can't but I need to learn
to just process it and get out my anger
some other way and not even respond to
people and let's go back to 12 years ago
because so many people have heard rumors
or they've seen a cliff and they don't
see the full spectrum and I am so sorry
that any of you ever had to see me like
that it makes me want to just I don't
know it makes me want to erase myself
sometimes I look at that and I'm just
like I can't believe I used to be that
miserable and that unhappy so I want to
let you guys know that I am so sorry for
ever saying those things that does not
represent anything how I feel that is
not who I am and I apologize deep down
to the core of my being and that
person does not exist anymore I'm all
about trying to bring awareness to
self-expression and love and I want all
of you guys to learn from my mistakes if
you take one thing away from this video
please do not make the same mistakes
that I did and I also want to say that I
know that there are millions of people
out there there are people watching this
right now that are judged by what they
believe in by who they are by how they
look by the color of their skin and I am
just one in a million that has to deal
with these type of prejudices every
single day so I don't want you to see an
old video of me and be like wow Jeffrey
says this but he's really about this and
it's embarrassing because I don't want
it to tarnish what I stand for right now
and we have come a long way with human
rights we have in the last 10 years you
guys it is crazy how life used to be and
how it is now but there are still so
much there's just so much growth to
happen this world is still so dark and
miserable and there are so many crazy
things happening that I don't know if
everyone fully realizes what it is to be
different life is too short you guys I
cannot spend every day thinking about my
past I have moved forward I know what I
stand for now and I want to be a better
person I want to be a better person from
the person I was last week I want to
learn and grow and I think that is
what's most important for all of us I
don't want to deal with anger and rage
and drama anymore I just feel like it's
just so unhealthy and it eats away at
you and whether it's a little online
food with a makeup brand or it's with an
ex friend or it's with this I'm just
tired of feeding into it and I am a
victim of that you guys I know I have
perpetuated stuff I have fueled fires
and it's just wrong and I don't want to
continue that behavior
I should be setting an example and I
have been completely doing the opposite
over the last few years and all of this
is just I think it's come to a point
where this video is necessary not just
about me bit but I want everyone to
learn from me and my wrongs when you're
being attacked or someone is bullying
you or hurting you it's okay to defend
yourself it's okay to respond but be
careful of how you respond because how I
handle things was not okay and you never
know how it is going to affect another
person and I know so many of you deal
with this on the daily basis but
remember what you say to the next
stranger could affect them in ways that
you do not know you just got to stay
strong and realize that hurting someone
else back is never going to satisfy
I had an empty void all through my early
20s I didn't know who I was I was always
angry I never you know I never felt
really accepted and I was always alone
and if you have those feelings that's
okay you will overcome them but it's
going to take time and it's going to
take a lot of self analyzation and you
have to want to change and you have to
want to grow I know what I need to work
on and fighting with people online and
all this is so unhealthy and
it's something that I'm going to
completely stop you know I get people
that try to get a reaction for me all
the time whether they make a video about
me whether they talk about my
relationship whether they degrade how I
look it's hard to process sometimes and
like deal with you know and I'm not
going to fit into anymore I am NOT going
to feed the fire of hate with hate I
just think it has to stop
you know I don't know what it is over
the last three years I just feel like I
am on a whole nother level of real
happiness I never let myself experience
happiness in my early 20s
happiness was something that was foreign
to me and I don't know whether it's from
being in love or being in a relationship
or actually achieving all my goals that
I ever wanted when I was little but I
have never been this happy and I don't
want other people and Outsiders to
affect my happiness and I have to stop
letting them so this is my story this is
what I've been wanting to say to you
guys for a long time if you are still
listening thank you for listening it
means something to me that I don't know
how to explain I don't want to sit here
and try it oh thank you guys so much no
but thank you just for listening and
hearing me out because you don't have to
you can judge me and say him
forever and that's okay you're allowed
to have whatever thoughts you want but
if you are listening to this thank you I
love you guys
