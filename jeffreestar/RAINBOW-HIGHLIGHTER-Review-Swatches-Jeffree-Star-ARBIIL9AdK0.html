channel today I'm doing a review on the
coveted rainbow highlighter the prism
highlighter from bitter lace Beauty
which if you haven't heard of the
rainbow highlighter yet you must uh you
must not on a phone so basically a few
weeks ago this little image popped up on
my IG and it was a pan with basically a
rainbow in it right which most of us
have all seen and heard about it by now
salt once and then an hour later I saw
it like 50,000 times later because
everyone kept tagging me so I guess if
you think of magical things and unicorns
and rainbows you automatically think of
Geoffrey star which I mad at that so a
few facts about the brand that I
discovered is the person that makes
these highlighters has an Etsy store so
if you don't know what Etsy is it's like
people make stuff at home or at handmade
or they have shops where they sell
directly to the consumer so I'm a big NC
fan here is the product BAM now I gotta
give you a first impression when I saw
this pan size I was like girl it's kind
of like that feeling when you have been
talking to a guy on Instagram for a
while and you finally match suck his
dick and you're like damn elf kind of
small
and then you fake that you're tired and
you go home that was kind of the feeling
I got when I saw this highlighter now
you know a regular Mac compact is this
size so this is more equivalent to like
a blush size now this is $22 $22 is a
lot it's a lot of money but it is
handmade and it is someone's Etsy store
so this is not being manufactured by a
machine or giant this is all hand poured
so I definitely get that you know the
indie makeup brand price tag so you know
take your tooth worth a lot of your
probably like 20 22 dollars okay
although I guess besides the size I've
heard a lot of people say no various
things about it so I'm like well I don't
like to listen what people say I like to
try it for myself so I am going to
swatch this now the pan it is small so
if you take your finger and you just
kind of like
run your whole fingers through you do
get that entire rainbow type of effect
so I've seen a lot of people use all
sorts of brushes now I'm just going to
swatch this on the back of my hand okay
really cute it definitely gives it that
prism like effect I'm addicted to shiny
things as soon as I see something shiny
and my eyes are like yeah okay so now
when looking at this I usually apply my
highlighters with you know my favorite
morphe 510 now is this gonna work for
this I don't think so
I've seen a lot of people use flat
brushes all sorts of stuff so let me
just grab a few brushes that I think
would work and then let's get just
watching so there's two ways to swatch
this of course the first one is using a
flat brush so you can get all the
rainbow effects now I was looking
through all my brushes I don't really
use those flat contour brushes or not
for me but I did find a morphe m45 9
brush which i think will fit in the
entire pan and we can now I've also seen
that everybody
swirl it around to get like that custom
color it created so we can definitely
try that as well so I think I'm just
gonna use the morphe brush first and I'm
just gonna take this and go all the way
down so I can hopefully get all the damn
colors alright it looks like a rainbow
on the brush let's see if this will work
so I'm literally just gonna take this
over my bronzer and just go down oh wow
come on rainbow bam
okay now it is a little more sheer than
I thought so I am going to do a few more
layers now the tricky thing is you got
to remember what side you put the damn
colors on so you're not fucking up your
shit there we go oh wow oh bitch okay
okay literally identical to real rainbow
damn her cheeks are all the leaf miss
thing first impressions it works
definitely works look at how when I move
my face you can see all those colors and
pretty Wow I think this is actually
really dope and even though I said the
pan size may be a little too small for
my liking I think with brushes like this
you really get the perfect size now of
course if the pan was bigger and sizing
of the colors were bigger it might work
with a bigger brush but I actually think
for this size it works pretty good what
I want to do next is definitely swirl it
around and put it on the other cheek and
see what happens so I'm gonna be using
little Gucci blush brush and I'm going
to just swirl this around that's the
color I got wooo
alright let's see what happens right on
this highlight oh wow
definitely a lot of fall out when I
swirled alright so when you swirl it you
basically get kind of like this pale
gold kind of shimmer
it's nice pretty definitely when you mix
it I would only wear if you are really
pale I don't think anyone with a darker
skin tone could pull this off because
it's really wide out me and bitch I'm
like a ghost so if you have a darker
complexion I would definitely watch out
for this I think she get the full
rainbow effect on any skin tone would
look amazing but definitely mix it well
I don't know but overall I really love
it I think it's pretty it is a really
dope idea it's really pretty it's really
unique
now of course was going to be the people
that were like well I would only wear
that on the festival and I wouldn't wear
that on a daily basis well if you're not
the type of issue was in the daily basis
I don't know why the hell you even found
my channel girl the hype is really all
the hype is real alright guys so that is
my first review I'm actually a big fan
of it and if you are dying to get hands
on it I would follow bitter laced beauty
on Instagram and check their store I
don't know when they were stocking but
they also have other shades and
different types of highlighters so I'm
excited to try them just before we leave
I want to say thank you guys so much we
just hit 1 million subscribers I I can't
believe it like when I stopped doing
music my youtube channel was dead it had
stopped a long time ago and when I
revived this motherfucker I can't
believe how quickly things are growing
so thank you guys for watching me thank
you guys for subscribing and for all the
love I
just I'm just kind of speechless right
now so I will see you guys on the next
video as you know there's a lot more
coming I'll see you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
