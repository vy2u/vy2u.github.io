back to my channel today we're going to
dive into this gorgeous feisty little
soft holiday no I'm just kidding that
was the last tutorial okay but for real
you guys today we are diving into this
beautiful glowy it's almost like there's
a fire or phoenix on my eyes it's very
dark it's very dramatic now the last
holiday video I did a very quick and
easy one and everyone was like but
where's the drama we want like whoa whoa
for the holidays so I'm like oh okay
let's pump the brakes here we are now of
course this is not the traditional red
lip brown eye this is my little Jeffrey
stars spin on the holidays so I hope you
guys enjoy I had a lot of fun creating
it so if you want to see how I got all
into this little gig then keep on
watching alright everybody we are going
to start this a little tutorial now I'm
really excited because this is the first
day that I'm using a new table in my
studio I know it's such a big deal but
it's different so cool I have so much
more room I am slowly transforming my
house right now girl it's a mother
fucking desk alright so we're just going
to prime these lids with a little Mac
painterly paint-pot
and this is going to ensure that our
eyeshadow stays on all night while we're
getting down and Fitzie
and sometimes before I finish I'll take
the left over and just kind of like
slide it under my eyes like get ready
for some pigment later I'm excited for
today because we're going to use a
pallet that I used the other day it is
from coloured raine and it's called the
Queen of Hearts palette and I got so
many requests to create the look I did
last week in my highlighter battle video
and this is what I use look at those
colors boots yes now the only thing that
it doesn't have is a really really pale
matte shadow to put all over so I'm just
going to quickly dip into my little busy
art basic palette you guys know this is
my tried-and-true
for just you know in everyday like
really bone white matte shade to put all
the way to my brow bone
oh right the whole entire eye is set
with this matte shade now let's dive
into that palette so when I did this the
other day I didn't really know what I
was gonna create I just really picked up
some brushes and was like you know what
let's just see what happens lord help me
now alright so I'm just going to take a
little Mac blending brush as usual and
I'm going to dip into shade air now this
one is a really easy light transition
shade just to get everything blowing and
blending now you guys know I like to
take my eyeshadow and go all the way to
the nose today I'm actually just going
to stop it with a brow is I know it's
shocking and so unlike me but we are
going to do something a little different
today all right now we're going to take
this darker orange shade called Empress
and we're just going to take a little
detailer brush from Mac this is the
two-two-one
and now I'm just going to deepen in my
sockets
now these colors really complement each
other so we're just going to be blending
up a little bit and if you ever want to
soften the line you can go back in with
that blending brush without any more
product and just kind of go over it and
bam now I'm going to take some a loose
powder because we're about to get really
smoky and oh really dramatic up in here
and we don't want any fallout doings
gonna take a little Chanel powder here
and we're just gonna dab this all under
our eyes and of course we're gonna brush
it off later so if it's messy and it
looks a little like cocaine or PCP that
will be brushed away later alright now
we're going to dip into this dark
metallic purple it is like a like a
violet purple the shade name is Queen
Mother and I'm just going to take us a
Bobbi Brown little shader brush and what
I'm going to do is I'm gonna start on
the lash line and just start dabbing and
and sometimes all you can turn my head
like this I know it looks a little weird
but it avoids um any fallout
alright now I'm going to take Empress
one more time and I'm just going to go
in between where the purple and the
orange are gonna meet yeah and you see
that I'm gonna tilt my head back like hi
I'm just going to take that brush and
just go back and forth and just slowly
kind of buff it upwards so it blends
together and then if you want a little
added blend ability you can always go
back in with your first brush you used
with the first shade and just go over
that again alright now you're going to
take the blending brush that we first
started with and you're going to dip
into emperess and then a little bit of
air at the same damn time and now I'm
just going to go over that purple line
one more time but now I'm going to just
kind of flick it out and just kind of
drag the eyeshadow and follow your
lashline and you're just going to go
like this and of course if you want to
subdue it you can go back in with the
flat shader brush from earlier okay all
the way back in time girl and just kind
of go over it with that bone matte white
shade now we're going to take a little
Packer brush a little shader brush if
you will and we're gonna dip into this
rusty cranberry shade called noblewoman
hmm
and we're just gonna coat that damn
brush I mean like you want it saturated
now we're just gonna take that color and
we're just going to kind of put it over
the purple but only in the middle so you
see that color already is kind of coming
through we're just gonna kind of spread
her out on the lid but only yeah really
only in the center we're gonna kind of
finesse her in there and say hi there I
need an extra pop on my lid today girl
and now we're about to really dive in
and we're going to use this topaz gold
shade called your majesty and I'm going
to use a little Tom Ford pencil brush
now this one is really pigmented so I'm
just going to kind of tilt my head and
lean back now I'm going to start it by
just putting it right in the corner
inner corner if you will and I'm gonna
drag this down the lash line a little
bit and then we're going to take that
shade and start applying it up here and
then you're going to drag it on your
and bring it all the way up and then
notice how I'm bringing it right up into
that crease or the darkness meets and it
is gonna all tie together now you guess
maybe all right now I'm going to take
the same brush and dip into that
noblewoman rusty red cranberry shade and
I'm just going to again follow and go
right over it and shade it in so this is
blended together it looks really pretty
and then I really just smoked out the
under eye with noble woman that
beautiful shade so that's really all I
did and then I connected it right here
just kind of bucked up and bam she's
ready for mascara and liner now to make
sure that it looks really a brushed I'm
gonna go in with that little detailer
brush that we used earlier and I'm gonna
go back in with noble woman for the
millionth time because I'm addicted and
I'm just gonna take this brush and just
really just shade the under eyes like
vinyl buffing them okay so I'm last but
not least gonna go back in with your
majesty and just take a little bit on
the brush and just kind of go right into
that smokiness again there we go BAM
she's feeling herself alright now we
need a little black eyeliner so I'm
gonna go in with my staple map smolder
eye pencil and put some in my waterline
now for mascara I'm gonna try something
new today I'm gonna go in with the Marc
Jacobs velvet and noir maximum gross
this is a long name everybody so let's
just pause this motherfucker major
Volume Mascara a velvet noir there we go
girl these tongue twisters I'm like ugh
alright so I'm gonna see how this one
works today I'm scared of leaving my mic
trust and tried now of course the test
for me is going to be doing the bottom
lashes because I'm particular about
those but here goes nothing like a one
dip is lasted this entire journey is one
is like coated heavy all right now I'm
quickly gonna pop on some big ol the
false lashes and I will be right back
the eyes are done now let's get to my
favorite part highlighting today I'm
gonna be going in with the new artist
Couture diamond glow powder in shade
slain ollie
it is this beautiful yellow toned
blinding highlighter and has a little
reflex of like lilac pearl in it it is
so stunning and I'm gonna do something I
normally don't do and I'm going to use
this bigger brush today because I'm
trying to fucking glow I don't know
about you but that's really my mission
so I'm gonna take a tiny bit of this
powder out and we're just gonna press it
right along my cheekbones Oh itch you
see that honey you see that she's not
playing today we're even gonna put some
about the brow because we want to shine
like no other I'm sorry I'm sorry oh my
god this is like one of those two
highlighters it's like I'm really not
here to play if you want to play me you
can try me okay so y'all know the drill

bow a tiny bit I'm gonna switch brushes
and use a little morphe rose gold offend
brush if you will and we're just going
to do our Cupid's bow like that oh hi
