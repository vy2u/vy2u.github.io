lipstick NYX in the building and I'm
lipstick Jeff reporting live so hard

I'm looking in the monitor like sisters
this is like meant to be I wish I had my
makeup done like that well actually I
should do my makeup like that and then
we'll really
we'll really take it there okay okay

take a little more orange bread yeah
well lucky enough but my entire lovesick
collection is all red so Nicole's
gagging over here but of course today we
are here to recreate a look that Nicole
created on me as well as David and we
used of course the brand new blood sugar
eye shadow palette now when you first
saw the colors months ago what were you
thinking oh I never know what's in my
crazy head right yeah no idea was gonna
look like this but I did get like
Valentine's Day vibes like it's very
like love it's like really wearable too
so I love like there's a lot of wearable
moments I think people seem neon colors
and they kind of freak out so it's like
you could just cover the theme neons
girl there's so many wearable moments so
for the shoot though we always like to
take it there and I really wanted Nicole
to show off as many shadows from the
palace possible with one look which of
course it's kind of hard to do sometimes
and there's 18 shades for this one so
I'm like girl do whatever you want to do
and this was one of the looks one of
like five of course you guys have seen a
lot of pictures online by now so where
are we creating of course I'm gonna call
it iconic I feel like this is the blood
sugar look like it's like full-on
full-on okay also pull shia so i'm gonna
say
we're dating this day yes Nicole is
actually on a makeup tour and you're
doing a lot of classes in the beginning
of the year and then again maybe in the
fall we'll see what happens okay now

dates so it's gonna go all the way into
May okay so it's way what kind of class
you're teaching so it's a demonstration
style class so I'm up there I have
different celebrity guests for every
class is my model right and I do a full
makeup tutorial and like kind of that
models classic like signature look that
I've read most of these people I've
worked with before yes for campaigns and
stuff so we got an influencer and she
just used AZ danger and jacqueline hill
for her classes so I'm like yes bitch
you better get the best of the best and
how fun is it to glam them because they
always do their own makeup yeah it's
always for it's always especially like
because you know they think it's a lot
of trust so it's not kind of scary but
all these people have developed
relationships with because they usually
will ask me to do stuff for campaigns
like that so it's fun it's just
especially doing for like a live
audience and like the class of people
that like love makeup
exactly cool and then of course where
can everyone buy a ticket
um you can buy tickets at lipstick NIC
calm and there is a tour section so it's
slash forward slash tour yeah and then

her models one day yay let me end girl
besides the makeup and the Scissorhands
its back again what up guys
alright so David girl you've been doing
so many colors on me we were like we're
gonna do red right yeah I was thinking
about like doing a bit of a older Nicole
 of your sister yeah really love
in that Valentine's Day that real
special yeah right I love it it's
sickening and then we also did a lot of
other looks
David is been having sleeking me down
lately I have some cool shoving off his
bones yeah give another girl next door
you know the realness okay so also real
quickly David I know so many people have
been asking you to start selling wigs
yeah David will have wigs a very soon we
will talk about that when they are
officially live but David's women
awesome damn wigs so you can finally
purchase some of his work and be coming
soon yeah I've just been working on it
takes time and I want to be a
perfectionist and make sure them giving
you guys the goods thanks you know steps
up this yep are you guys so these two
combined forces created this amazing
look it's so just like it embodies what
this whole entire palette and collection
is about so thank you guys for killing
it as always of course alright so if you
guys want to see how we did this crazy
magic thing keep on watching so we're
trying to remember you guys what we
actually did on set and I wrote down a
lot of notes while the Cole was doing my
eyes so I think the first Shane you
dipped into was sweetener sweetener lid
alright yeah let's dive in so what I do
with every metallic shade is I'll spray
a little bit of fix+ on the back of my
hand for that extra bob of I'm sure
little popped with all the metallics so
I'm just gonna lay a little bit of this
down now of course you don't have to the
shade by itself is great but if you want
this extra really rich metallic love a
little fix + or setting spray like you I
wanted a shade that I really didn't see
in a lot of palettes just something
different
all right now Nicole was gonna cut the
crease and she uses liquid lips a lot
which I live for and you guys if you
don't know my formula is a vegan and I
save so you can put these in your
waterline and let them dry you can put
them anywhere you can use a matte liner
so we're gonna use shade problematic
you're gonna cut your crease and then
we're gonna use some red rub some Red
Rum yes we might mix it elastic red cool
I love watching Nicole do this part put
it kind of you need to cut a
so you're blending out the brush I had
no product on it right yeah so I just
took I'm taking a dry brush with no
product on it and I'm just blending out
the problematic lip up onto the brow
bone mm-hmm
this will give me a really nice base for
what I start blending all the shadows
better blend all right so now what's
next next we're gonna use cherry soda
okay we're gonna do this all over your
brow bone and it's kind of gonna be like
the middleman in between tongue pop and
extraction beautiful yay and we're doing
no brows today everyone we're gonna have
full alien moment if you look sure sort
of matches your hair it does it totally
does I remember at the photo shoot we
didn't know if we were gonna do brows
either noise one for it
and before I take it up too high I'm
gonna take a little bit of tongue pop
mm-hmm
blend her down yeah pop I mean blender
up up and down yeah
Oh what I are taking some glucose what a
bit of glucose and just using that right
at the top here no this is like a
straight-up pure matte white which I
used to do all over my entire like whole
entire lid and face almost back in the
day is your head you're setting thought
that was my study powder
oh love it
are we dipping into extraction we're
gonna dip into extraction so we're just
gonna enhance the cut crease right there
so we're gonna make it a little bit
darker
Nicole is blending to filled it's coming
together what's that mean together we're
gonna take a little bit more glucose
okay so we're gonna build underneath
your eye now okay and we're gonna pack
this right here in the front holy
mm-hmm she has pigment so wait whoa girl
I love that now we're gonna cut your
bottom crease that's what we use here at
Brown don't you forgot you guys mid
tutorial we're like where do we put the
Redrum liquid lip yeah under oh we also
did this shoot like a couple weeks ago
so I forgot like yeah I'm pretty but
remember now we go right underneath that
white shadow
actually before it drives all the way
I'm gonna blend it out a little bit
so now right here at the base I'm gonna
take a little bit of coma the darkest
shade in the palette darkest shade in
the palette I'm gonna set this guy's
here dog barking its draw fun downstairs
yelling her head off she's in full play
mode so we're gonna take some root canal
okay this is one of my favorite colors
in this palette I'm gonna buff this out
right underneath coma
we're going to dip into prick which is a
sheet over here it's like this really
beautiful bright orange it's nuts right
it's like an orange trade red hybrid and
of course this has the needle and
stamped into the powder which of course
this one has the medical symbol over
here I had to switch it up a little bit
and I thought these very fittings I love
to name it prick yeah so where you gonna
put that again I'm gonna put this right
under here okay right in the front just
a little bit this for some detailing
mm-hmm oh my god it looks so sick it's
like okay eyeliner next all right
eyeliner liquid yeah got liquid yeah
favorite Tom word the best if you guys
have never tried this the little pricey
but it's so good its dual ended so it
has like a finer point for detailing and
then a bigger point and it's just like
it's quick it is so fast
I'm going to finish up the eyeliner so
I'm gonna pull this in to a little point
right in here oh you're gonna have some
black in there mmm bright in between
okay coos and sweetener let me hold my
breath all right it's almost time for
lashes so I'm gonna quickly pop in some
contacts before my eyes get crazy and we
do all the glue so I will be right back
contact lenses are in first of all look
at these short nails girl don't judge me
okay so I am going to quickly do mascara
and liner now I prefer to do this on
myself no matter who does my makeup
because my eyes they're not sensitive
but when someone's going in there I
don't know wise for some reason when you
do it yourself
it just doesn't water so I'm going to do
the mac cosmetics fascinating white and
smolder with of course the iconic
Benefit Cosmetics roller lash be right
back we got liner mascara on and now
it's time for some lashes my favorite
part I think like this is one of Nicole
signature moments it's just kind of got
flashes and slanging the face well we're
going to start with bottom lashes and
kind of even bottom me doing this duo
vegan lash glue so you're putting that
right where we started that shadow wine
so it's actually underneath your real
lashes damn just feel like I love it
like little butterflies like resting my
cheeks tickling all right what are we
doing it we're gonna do top lash we're
gonna use craze by flutter okay it was
very open in here I love these already
popped it mouth invisible yeah these are
sick
all right let's pop this lash
we're gonna layer a 301 a big crazy lash
I'm gonna cut it in half okay
and use the shorter half at the end okay
cool
no big they are oh wow
bitch like I'm sorry I'm not the flutter
away Jim look at that side shot where's
our photographer when we need to look at
that I look right there Bob oh my god
alright so now we're gonna dip into the
24 karat skin frost Pro palette and
shades sarcophagus
I can hear better I love a highlight in
here all right it's time for lips live
are we gonna do today
well today we're gonna use Romeo and I'm
nude but on the shoot day I think we
just did I'm nude yes in the picture
it's gonna be kind of an ombre lip
before Nicole does my lipstick since we
are gonna be using liquid lips today I
am going to do a lip scrub to make sure
I am a nice smooth and ready so today
we're gonna go in with my Avila red lip
scrub and shade cherry soda oh this is
so yummy girl when I have the munchies
at night half the jar it's a wrap but
today we're just gonna use them to prep
the lips you are gonna feel so smooth
they've been for a snack bitch I know
we're hungry and then sometimes if
there's sugar on my face I will take a
Beauty Blender and just wipe it off oh
yeah
mm-hmm such a good tip to to use a brush
if you guys pull real hombre love using
a brush all right now for setting
sprayer we're gonna use a little skin de
Naevia this is the bridal makeup
finishing spray I think it's fitting
yeah hose me down bride-to-be this is a
good look for like when the priest just
like does anyone object and I burst in
the room looking like this like I do
we're done you guys this is almost what
we need some hair on yeah because I look
like a bald bitch right now but I think
red to match Nicole I'm a red red
everything you guys this is a we're in
the season of red so sound a lot
I'm gonna go slap some hair on David
hook me up girl okay David you gonna
wink at me up wig it up baby
all right so he slicks down the edges
slicks me down yeah and then this is a
wig cap we already did the foundation in
so don't judge our wonder stands we
catch up the budget okay so the one like
they're probably yeah
so we put foundation on the wig cap so
they blend into what we're about to do
so just for the record you guys when we
do like photoshoots and this type of
stuff like I know real drag queens I
glue everything down I don't really do
that unless we're going to events now if
we don't know I had hair surgery like Oh
like almost two years ago actually which
there is a video on me having a whole
crazy procedure done so I don't really
glue down the edges so a lot of people
ask that so for events I will but for
like photo shoots video I don't really
do that because my hairline so the sort
