channel today we're going to talk about
espionage and self sucking no we're
actually going to dive it's just some
crazy ass shit here girl
I have been seeing everyone on YouTube
talk about review try and attempt to
work out the MAC Cosmetics roller wheel
liquid liner now when I first saw this
online I was like wow okay like of
course my gut which a cutting pizza
because I saw the applicator and I was
like girl Pizza Hut stuffed crust with
pepperoni
cinnamon sticks with extra icing and
boneless wings I don't know about anyone
else so I got a whole pamphlet here
y'all we're going to talk about this
crazy liner MAC Cosmetics did send me
this PR and I'm like okay I'm kind of
not really excited by Mac lately I don't
know about anyone else but this caught
my attention because it is something
that I've never really seen before I
don't know Mac's been a little stagnant
lately I think there was just so many
releases from other brands and there's
so many new companies coming up Mac you
better step the fuck up we are going to
attempt to try out this liner I got two
shades here today we have on a roll
black and roller Royale I already have
my makeup done I was reviewing the
Sephora mosquito collection and girl
show was bombed so I'm like you know
what let me just sit down here and
Travis liners so if you want to see if
they work or not keep on watching so
this part says as 0.3 fluid ounces in
here ok I don't even know if that's a
lot for a liner I'm about to go look ok
oh wow ok so when you pull out of the
box
it looks like this the applicator is
very long but then as the grooves in it
for your fingers I'm going to assume so
you have a nice tight grip alright so
let's open her up oh wow ok so it kind
of just pops off like a lid and oh my
god okay first of all in person this is
so tiny let me hold up my hand so you
guys can really see how tiny the wheel
is holy shit I've watched one other
person's review and it did not look this
tiny like on camera I don't know how it
looks to you guys and then look
it is thin let me just do a little turn
so you guys can see it that is razor
thin Wow
here's what the inside of the component
looks like where the product is and I
guess if you want to get more product on
the wheel we'll call it you have to dunk
it in again so let's just see what the
hell this is supposed to do okay so the
fact sheet says Mac reinvent the wheel
with our roller wheel liquid liner a
ground-breaking spinning disc applicator
absorbs the perfect amount of product to
provide a continuous smooth even stroke
of color skinny lined and defined a wing
effect or a bold geometric look let the
rolling applicator do all the work for
the perfect liquid line every time being
high roller on hot wheels with a roller
okay girl I get it these are going to
retail for 21 dollars a piece of course
I have two colors here but there are two
more shades coming that is a oh okay
there's a shiny black and a matte black
which one do we have we have the matte
black thank God and then there is the
warm brown and of course we have the
blue here oh yeah knowing you guys this
is going to be online August 17 and in
stores September 14 so literally almost
a month later you'll be in stores that's
kind of weird let's get into the damn
review and see if he's higher obviously
I don't have any false lashes on I just
have on the benefit a roller lash
mascara yeah we're just going to go in
here and see if this works I'll just do
like a line first and then maybe we'll
have some fun so I guess let's take this
wheel face thing alright so we're going
to take this and
let me tell my head you guys let's see
if we can get a better look here
okay that is what we have so far I mean
that was quick okay I don't know about
anyone else but when I'm doing a liner I
hold my breath so I'm like so excuse me
if I'm not talking while I am wheeling
okay I think I need a little bit more
product because it is getting a tiny bit
streaky but when I did it that first
time right away it definitely didn't
skip so let me dunk it again and let's
see what happens okay I mean that was
not that bad all right I'm dunking in
for a third time now let's try to flick
this out
she's looking a little fucked it I just
fucked if his shit up okay definitely
for trying it out the first time it is a
little difficult because when you turn
the thing a little bit it could get
product like that where I thought that
was the straight line but I turned it
too much and it got like wonky so let me
try to roll some more now I will say
this it doesn't feel bad isn't hurt or
feel like weird or anything the wheel is
smooth the applicator feels a nice we're
definitely taking it there with the wing
when she says she's just doing a subtle
wedding look this is what happened
definitely something that you have to
get a hang like get the hang of it's not
like okay BAM this is easy but it's a
little tricky now I did kind of
straighten it out it is very dramatic
but I can't look for it and just for fun
I want to take the wheel and just see
what happens if I go into my crease
right here oh wow
see yeah it's a little messy you guys if
you don't if you're not careful doesn't
like go completely straight you do have
to kind of manipulate it I think it's
like I'd rather just take a liner brush
and just do it quickly because girl I
just fucked up this makeup now that I
sucked up this side look at that shit
you guys what is going on
this is shade roller Royale and oh my
god it's hugging brightest blue so I
figure do you know what let's see if
this works
your suit I mean it's skip and the
pigment is really not there I'm just
mapping out where my chicken plants are
going to go don't mind me
as you see you guys the wheel it can be
fun when you have like 10 hits off the
ball and you're just trying to live the
wheel works when you're trying to really
slay a liner I don't fucking know but it
will tell you this okay the product
feels thick like when this is dry right
here in my eye my eye feels heavy this
on my mouth feels thick like bizarre
actually I'm like all right like Laura
Lee would say I think this product might
be a little gimmicky only thing I did
not like about it well there's a few
things I wish that the pigment was like
embedded into the wheel so it had
continuous non-stop coverage from it so
you can have to continuously keep
dunking because as you saw I mean all
jokes aside obviously I just paint all
over my face but as you go down it was
just really hard to keep a straight line
I think there has to be a lot of
practice sometimes when you try
something new you're not really going to
love it I'll definitely have to try this
out a few board times but the way the
applicator just kind of didn't stay
consistent and wouldn't mean by that
when you're it's that close to your eye
and you're trying to look at yourself
right I'm just going to it on my hand it
was hard to see like okay there was one
right but it was hard to turn it or even
try to make a line opaque it's just kind
of a little hard to get a hold of so not
my favorite thing in the world
definitely love that Mac made something
innovative and new I think that the
makeup industry can be a little stale
sometimes I mean what else can people
make when there is so much else out
there so props to them for coming up
with something new if you want to try or
give it a whirl obviously try yourself
but this was my experience now let me
call my doctor
I have some fucking shit to fix yes
hahaha how do I look
you look pretty crazy looks like a
surgeon just drawing your face okay Ted
oh yeah I'm gonna get all this done and
hopefully will be healed by the weekend
all right you guys thank you for
watching another review about to go what
do we love to do I need to go I don't
even know we need to go relax a long day
that sure has all right you guys thank
you for watching some makeup debauchery
we'll see you next see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
