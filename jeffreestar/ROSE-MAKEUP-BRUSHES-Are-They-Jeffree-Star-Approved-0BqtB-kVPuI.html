channel today we are going to be trying
out yes I'm holding one of the items
we're going to be trying out today we
are going to be testing out the new
storybook
cosmetics rose brush set I mean look
before we even dive into everything we
just got a look at this damn thing
because they are so amazing
storybook cosmetics is an indie brand
that I discovered on Instagram and I
reviewed their eyeshadow palette like a
month or two ago it was the wizardry and
witchcraft palette which looked like
this and this was Jeffrey star approved
I love the formula and I don't know I'm
just really into the shadows themselves
and of course the packaging is done
named so besides testing out the Rose
brush set in today's video I also have a
giveaway that I am doing now this was
just done on my own and I bought the
stuff with my own money
I did not team up with the brand but if
you want to enter the giveaway you will
be winning this eyeshadow palette so
this one is brand new obviously besides
the eyeshadow palette I am also giving a
way the entire brush set that I am
reviewing today if not the used one of
course so everything will be brand new
and all you have to do to enter the
giveaway is leave a comment down below
you can say hi you can comment on the
video you can give me an emoji whatever
you want to do but leaving a comment
down below will enter you and you have
to be subscribed to my channel but
besides that you guys let's dive into
the expression alright you guys so when
you get the rose brush set it comes in
as a beautiful a storybook cosmetic
pouch I love it and look at the little
bow you guys I think all the little
details that they do is really cool the
boat obviously is for pulling the zipper
and then it has a little charm on it on
the back that is a William Shakespeare
quote it says what's in a name that
which we call the rose by any other name
would smell sweet girl that's cute for
$55 that's what this retails for you get
the little pouch and then you get for
bone of the brushes now listen from a
packaging whore like myself who is so
into this type of stuff I was obsessed
when I saw this on Instagram I mean just
look at them the detailing you get a
little logo right here and you still
have you guys I know I always talk about
weight and stuff and it's always a
fucking like you know how I feel about a
heavy products please feel nice now I do
want to talk about what it says on the
website about these guys
the official name also quit for this
brush that you guys is called the what's
in a name rose brushes trademark work
and basically you guys for fifty five
dollars you get these four beautiful
brushes it says that's the stunning
scarlet ombre cruelty free synthetic
bristles have a gorgeous green rose stem
that is made out of metal alloy so it's
sturdy you guys these feel good
alright so in this set you guys you get
a tapered highlighting brush which I'm
going to assume is this one now when
they say highlighting they could mean
like a metallic cheek glow or they could
mean like putting you know setting
powder or powders over your concealer so
we're definitely going to test out with
that you also get a angled contour and
blush brush and that looks something
like this guy that is the angled one and
then you get a flat top powder brush and
a dome top powder brush which here is
the flat top and then here is the dome
top powder brush now I do go to say I
know you can't feel these through the
screen they feel really good bitch these
feel good so it does say that these
brushes can be used with creams and
liquids however the bristle density so
like how thick the bristles are in here
is more suitable for powder formulas the
brushes can be washed and the bristles
will maintain their beautiful scarlet
color well I like how they said that
because a lot of times you guys you'll
buy something you'll wash it and then
like the color kind of like comes off
and you're like but allegedly these do
not do that of course I've never used
them and I have not cleaned them yet so
we'll have to see about that at a later
date but you guys basically I am going
to try out all four brushes I do have to
put on primer and foundation with
another brush because there is not a
foundation brush in this set but we will
test out loose powder foundation powder
contour and highlight so if you want to
see me get down on this
face then keep on watching alright you
guys for primer I know I've used so many
primers on this channel I've actually
been using this off-camera for a few
times and I really love it it's from a
brand called touch in soul that I found
on Sephora this brand is kind of indie
and basically this is a smooth and pore
covering primer it is kind of like tacky
and almost like not play believe it has
like that weird human reminds me of the
Urban Decay optical illusion primer oh
my god its connect the same color that's
kind of weird so I'm going to take a
little dollop like that and let's put
this all over my face
now it doesn't leave your skin like
really tacky tacky but it just feels
very like smooth I mean that is a really
good word to describe it
smooth is fuck girl all right for
foundation today I'm going to be going
in with the Dior forever foundation now
Jacqueline Hill recommended this
foundation and I'm like girl if you love
it I got to try this out so basically
this is like a pore refining perfect
makeup everlasting wear with sunscreen
type of foundation and I really love it
I'm just gonna be real I didn't even
sell my first impressions because it's
been out for a while and I'm like
growing no I'm going to watch that and
maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm right I don't
know but I figure let me just turn off
camera and then I'll try it in the video
if it even works
girl it works now usually I apply it
with a Beauty Blender but because we're
doing two brush video I thought maybe
I'll try to do a brush now not a lot of
you're going to be like what a hell is
going on so I'm going to try this look
at Sephora dome like a little pro brush
and I'm going to do the foundation first
and then we're going to test out the
rose brushes
of course we got to do one more step
which is apply concealer before we try
all the brushes with the powder so I'm
going to be going in with the Make Up
For Ever Ultra HD and we're just going
to you see a Beauty Blender in my hand
y'all I'm just going to bounce this out
really quickly oh my god uses a lot
bitch where is it it was like Rob
Kardashian's Instagram Hank there
anymore there we go
all right the concealer is blended out
now let's try the brushes okay so the
first brush for you guys it says the
well we can do them in every order we
want I really want to do the powder
brushes first because I am going to do a
little bit of baking and some foundation
powder all over this face so what the
website says that there is a dome top
powder brush and a flat top powder brush
so of course this will be the flat one
which to me looks like you could like
pack on powder with it and then of
course we have the dome top powder brush
so I think you guys I'm just going to
first of all take some loose powder so
I'm going to go in with my favorite
lemare the powder now I would normally
use this one for the flattop one I'm
down to put in like powder foundation
but for this we're going to set our
concealer everywhere where I put the
concealer so let's oh my god I barely
dip that any girl the product adheres to
the bristles thank you Jesus dust that
off and I'm going to press this under my
eye oh wow all the product is like
literally in my skin that was really
easy I'm like learning magic tricks
going on here let me look let me look
closer wow yeah this side is like yeah
it's normal but this side is like extra
snatch
wow you guys durable of course we are
going to hit the chin come on chin and
then the little smile lines a little bit
on the nose and then the forehead
alright now we're going to try a V Rose
a flat top a powder brush now this looks
really dense it feels good so I'm just
going to go in what I'd normally would
do lately I've been loving the Chanel is
just the double perfection lumineer
foundation powder I'm going to hit pan
on this soon so we're going to go in
with this and we are going to of course
the brush is clean we're going to pack
some powder on that welcome bristles we
are coated now what I'm going to do like
I normally do is take this and we're
going to press and pack this all into
the skin I think the only thing that I
would say about this one already is I
wish it was maybe a little bigger just
because packing it on you see you
already need to dip it again
so you have to kind of go in smaller
sections and if you would have had like
a bigger brush but to me that's really
not the end of the world because hey if
you're said now I'm doing your makeup
unless you're in a brush you're good
girl that should have given me full
coverage of vibes and I am living for it
it really packed it into the skin and I
am a fan already okay cool and now let's
try to contour
okay only in the Geoffrey video will I
review one blog menu 16 other ones I was
just feeling a little corpse like so I
need some lipstick and before everyone's
that girl what the fuck is that
this is the new skin tight lip mo hmm
now we are going to try out the contour
brush so it looks like something like
this it is angled I love that so I'm
going to assume we're just going to go
and what are we going to use today the
first thing that I'm noticing is I have
this little I love this one this is the
Maybelline master contour you've seen me
use this plenty of times and I'm just
going to go in and let's just see how
this works first of all great it picks
up the pigment I love that about these
brushes okay so I'm just going to start
here and kind of follow my natural
razor-sharp cheekbone and Wow
and then we're just gonna with no other
product it's going to kind of blend up
and see if the product wants to move it
applied it really like I don't want to
say natural but kind of natural when you
guys know I go hard on the contour and
this is like I don't even know why I'm
still blending it really doesn't need it
I know a lot of you're probably
wondering like how does it feel to hold
the brush like I am reviewing brushes I
know I don't do that often on my channel
but I do want to note that these are
easy you know when I saw them online I
was a little weary I was a little scared
like okay it's a stem how hard is it
going to be a whole compared to like a
normal contour brush just like thick
it's really not like I don't really
notice a difference it's almost like you
have like a ballpoint pen and this isn't
too heavy what you're like oh my god
it's like a dead weight it feels really
good like it's expensive feeling but not
like oh my god I'm gonna like get carpal
tunnel tomorrow type of healing you guys
know about the cut this jaw line up and
it's blending really really nice I'm
just taking some more product and just
kind of tucking it under the chin
ja now the only thing that you really
can't do with that brush is contort your
nose so we can skip it or I mean
honestly you could use the tip of this
if you're like hey girl this is all we
got
you can put product there and probably
just kind of you know flick down oh yeah
that distributed product is it going to
be the best not like nose contour of
your life
probably not but hey it's working
alright you guys this space is contoured
now it says you can also apply the lush
with this brush so I'm just going to use
my hand and dust it off and let's try
some blush I guess boom
alright you guys for blush today we're
going to go in with my one of my
all-time favorite it is from Marc Jacobs
Beauty it is called lines and last night
and we are just going to go in with the
same brush now that's a little clean and
we'll just oh girl yeah these brushes
hold the pigment let's just apply a
little bit to the apples of our cheeks
and see what happens I love how soft it
applies it it's like not too extreme
it's not like oh shit she has blush on
it is really soft
alright the blush applied really nicely
I'm loving how it looks and now it says
it's like a tapered highlighting brush
this is the only thing I really haven't
used yet now highlighting I'm going to
assume it's like a lot of the primes you
guys know I'll take highlighting powder
meaning to highlight your under eyes not
metal or metallic looking highlighters
you can take this bam bam and press the
under the eye you can definitely do that
but I mean I'm down to apply some
highlight for the metal glow today we're
going to be going in with one of my
favorites this is from the leaked makeup
this is the Solstice highlighting
palette let's open her up and I'm going
to be using these two powders today
that's actually a cream we're just going
to go in with this little guy and here
we'll just mix and match okay so I'm
just going to take this and merge it
into the contour and now this is a
really really bright highlight so of
course if you don't want this look you
can go in with something softer now it
was a little worried that this is going
to be too thick on top and kind of make
it go everywhere but it really put it
exactly where I wanted it
I'm just going to take a little bit of
the highlighting powder maybe do my chin
in this little hair very subtly of
course you guys see I just hit my nose
to an extreme level
besides that you guys we have tested out
all four brushes so let me give y'all my
final thoughts
so after testing these bad bitches out I
will say this
I'm a fan they all worked I was like
okay maybe one's going to do the job or
like I didn't know how they were going
to feel they feel expensive
I love the design the design is a plus
for me I'm sure you guys are like yes
girl they are very cute I love how soft
the bristles feel a lot of the times
with synthetic or vegan brushes they can
feel a little plastic a a little cheap
but obviously companies are finding a
way to make them feel way more luxurious
because girl these are really really
nice so let's go in order let's see here
we have the powder brush this one was
amazing it applied everything really
great very soft now the flat top powder
brush it packed in the powder amazing of
course I did say something about the
size I do wish it was maybe a little
bigger to distribute the powder more
quick lean but hey it did the job so I
cannot hate on that now the angle the
contour and blush brush I loved it this
one maybe my favorite from all for the
way it applied the contour was so quick
and easy and I just loved how it just
blended out soft then of course we just
did the highlighting tapered brush which
definitely worked I wouldn't normally
apply my highlight with this big of a
brush looking in the monitor it
definitely went a little over the
contour I would probably keep the
highlight probably a little bit up there
but the course is a bigger brush and hey
it may be for highlighting with powders
under the eye I didn't ask the company
but I will find out eventually alright
so I'm just going to say it right here
