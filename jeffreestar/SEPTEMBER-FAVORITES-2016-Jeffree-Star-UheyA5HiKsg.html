a little family vacay to Michigan to
visit his parents and attire family

Wyoming Michigan what's up there has
been a lot of crazy changes I just moved
into a bigger warehouse for jeffree star
cosmetics things are expanding and
growing like crazy so if you only see me
at home and at the office and an on
camera it's because I don't have any
free time which is a good thing and I'm
so blessed to be able to you know wake

to see the fam and
one thing led to another we asked him to
come out with Jeffrey's growth and
everything in the company just moving
warehouses and everything he was able to
offer in your position actually in his
warehouse so yeah it's crazy we went
from six employees to now almost at 75
at the shipping facility so it's so cool
to be able to employ my friends and
family and carry on this fucking crazy
legacy long story short is AK wanted a
change of scenery and he now works at
jeffree star cosmetics warehouse yeah if
you've never seen this this definitely
has to be in my September favorites this
is long bomb I know sexual jokes insert
here but this is actually made in the
country of assault of a Kia listen for
all you cannabis smokers out there this
is everything does this look crazy looks
like a science experiment just like that
now I'm more of a vaporizer smoker I
like the volcano or the handheld that
listen it's a wrap if I hit that right
now but hey that's what amethyst or for
and look Thank You Instagram because I
found this really cute little piece
Cheers
yay so we got two roommates we got Zach
and daddy and it's about to be crazy in
Calabasas so you'll definitely be seeing
a lot more of him on my channel we gotta
get into try some crazy shit all right
they'll definitely be sing both of them
very soon all right now let's dive into
some makeup now September see it's a
little tricky because I tried out so
many new products it was hard to find
something that I used consistently every
day like I used so many foundations my
skin was like yes but I'm something that
I'm really excited to announce you guys
is that wet-and-wild
made their summer highlighters which are
only 399 and they're fucking dope they
made them permanent in our collection so
now you can get them any time y'all want
because I know when I use them a few
months back you guys cleaned out
Walgreens you're cleaned out Rite Aid
and they were really hard to find and
then they just really blew up Willy big
on Instagram so it's so awesome that
they got so much love but for a quick
little refresh
just petals is a shade that I love and
adore my dumbass did not wear today
sorry about that but let me just do a
little one too so watch oh my god I just
put this over the tiger and say hi this
color is so pretty on the cheeks and uhm
it's affordable and it really works and
that's why I love it this next one I've
definitely talked about in a lot of
videos recently it's the Tarte shaped
Cape concealer I don't know what is in
this magical bottle but it leaves my
under eyes but finished and it's just a
really good product for some reason it
is full coverage but once you blend it
out and my favorite is to use a damp
Beauty Blender once you blend this out
it just looks so full all this but it
doesn't look cakey and a lot of the
times so many brands even after a
setting powder it gets really crazy
after like 20 to 30 minutes and mmm this
shit is magical now a last makeup
product is a biome the tomforde
traceless perfecting foundation oh now
I've been trying a lot of foundations on
camera but I always go back to this um
my favorite cocktail of all you guys
know the door air flash will never leave
my face but I've been mixing this and
then this oh my god now you all know I
love my armani luminous silk but this
though besides Tom Ford being such an
amazing designer his makeup line has
been slaying my existence and I
definitely recommend just you have try
this got on there too wrong
one of my favorite brands lemare put out
something a while back called the mist
and it looks something like this this is
a not like it's on a setting spray it's
more to like rejuvenate and hydrate your
skin so before makeup and even while
it's on I would definitely spray it now
I mean hi this bottle we're talking
about low that's getting like I'd order
one like a Sbarro um it is just really
good to hydrate the skin you can put it
on over makeup but it's not a setting
spray so it's not going to keep your
makeup locked in it's just gonna keep
your foundation more hydrated and if it
gets kind of you know dry or weird
throughout the day it definitely helps
when you are touching up or
hang out I've been using this for a few
months and I definitely should have
included it in a favorites video by now
but I'm obsessed now the price point for
this guy is a little hefty but
definitely worth it
listen toners I have been through a
million of them before and I've
mentioned some previous toners in other
videos but listen after I remove all my
makeup at the end of the day there's
always residue from the makeup wipes I
get a big old cotton circle and I dump a
lot of this on there and I tone my
entire face ears neck throat shoulders
even the back of my neck because it just
kind of feels good but um this stuff
it's alcohol free now you guys know I'm
an anti aging whore and alcohol it's
never really going to touch this face so
always try to find alcohol-free
cleansers and toners I promise you in 10
years you'll thank me Cicely is a very
luxurious skincare brand and you know
I'm trying to not age it's been about 10
years where this bitches look the same
and I think it's because of high-end
skincare and of course diet hereditary
shit which I will definitely do a
skincare video all I've been saying that
like all year right I will promise you
before the years up I will do a skincare
video let's move on to some fashion
shoes I have been so into loafers lately
and I know a lot if you're gonna buy
please listen to Christian at Louboutin
put out loafers a long time ago and he
covered them with spikes and so many
brands have stolen the idea and tried to
rip it off but there's only one
tried-and-true and that is the Christian
Louboutin loafers oh my god first of all
these are deadly they really are sharp
like I know you can't fill them through
the fall over the computer but like
these are perfect for obviously looking
fabulous and also kicking someone's ass
if they're calling you a faggot on the
street these are worn down to the bone
yes if you've never seen red bottoms
used and abused this is what they look
like the red sadly comes off I've heard
you can get them repaired and painted
over but I like something that looks a
little worn in
besides the loafers they also do
sickening sneakers which I know I've
talked about my obsession with sneakers
in every favorites video but look oh god
this metallic Silver Surfer dream oh my
god if these weren't just worn two days
ago I would kiss the bottoms but we can
kiss the top
mm huh oh my god it's got lipstick on
the shoe fuck it I love sneakers they
are just God spikes though I'm just such
a fucking fashion whore you guys and you
know sunglasses y'all when I tell you
when I tell you I've been going off on
the sunglasses oh my god like everything
is dropping for fall season or you know
fall in the fashion world and in all the
stores it's been flooded with so many
sunglasses but these ones first of all
the case alone is so futuristic and cute
I'm like obsessed with what they're
doing now with sunglass cases I'm like
okay already I'm good girl
no these are very futuristic very
robotic and they are chrome silver and
they look something like this
let's put them on huh I love them like
I'm obsessed with makeup or without I
love how I look especially when you
don't have any eyebrows like we have no
eyebrows you guys sunglasses are
definitely a key and I just love these
ones they are very like little they're
not like winged but they're kind of
winged me and they're just kind of
bitchy and I'm just obsessed with them
last but not least the grand finale is
listen I took the plunge and I got
another MS Birkin bag girl I added my
10th one to my collection I come pick
the fucking boxes once you see that
orange baby there is no going back let's
do a little 5 second unboxing my
on me yes it looks like this it is a
gorgeous tan nude like I'm looking at
the monitor I just want to scream oh my
god like oh my god I didn't make a
lipstick this exact color it's
everything
now you guys know I am a handbag
collector so when Hermes calls you and
says that they got something special for
you you get in the damn car and you go
see what's up so I cannot wait to put
this in the vault and just pray that I
got a pink one for Christmas all right
guys that concludes my step timbre
favorites
I can't believe October is here I am so
ready to really get into some dark
dramatic kind of like this fall makeup
like I just want to drench myself in
dark wine color lipsticks and dark nudes
and I'm just ready for some crazy ass
tutorial so oh man

more tutorials and trying out a lot more
crazy shit so until next time my bye
