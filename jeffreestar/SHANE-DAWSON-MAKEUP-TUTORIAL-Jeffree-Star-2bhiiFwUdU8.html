channel today I have a very special
guest we have Shane Dawson in the
building I have never felt uglier it
looks like when you like get it online
versus when it comes oh it's bad
listen okay so so I recently did Shane
Dawson's podcast it was so much fun and
I'm like okay who has glammed you and no
one not God so I thought you know what
we should give shame the jeffree star
makeover we're going to give them our
best products today no drugstore for you
never all right so today we're gonna
dive into a bunch of makeup and we're
going to see how much your face can take
it I literally have a wadded up tissue
because I sweat so much that I didn't
okay we're gonna we're going to give you
some good primer so a lot of these
products will I mean everything any of
these products no that's kind of the fun
part as Shane does not know what any of
this stuff is so we're gonna dive into
some glamour and some filth so if you
want to see the transformation and keep
on watching the first step here is
primer okay okay that's like paint yes
we're going to prime the skin so the
foundation looks so laid right and
there's a lot of options here so we'll
let you pick I feel like we should use
maybe one of the world's most expensive
primers on you can I guess like
everything you use on me can I guess how
much it is or we have an option of one
with gold flakes in it real gold go home
leave so what do you think I mean look
at the packaging on both okay um I'm
going to say this one's probably more
expensive because when people get like
too fancy to glittery and it's a
this is probably cheaper I feel like
this was probably like 80 bucks okay
what about the gold 175 if that's it
yeah you got three million now this guy
is it comes to all the comparison this
is $120 right okay we're gonna try to
throw on you it's really good I look at
it no we're doing the gold no do
whatever you want okay wait so I have a
question before I ever do anyone's
makeup I always like this touch their
skin with what kind of what kind of skin
do you think you have normal oily fine
 gross crazy
 dry like sometimes like my
boyfriend will take off something and
he'll rip it off and it looks like a
ruffle chip would you eat it sometimes
okay the gold one is really good for
oily skin a little bit and we're going
to edit it will this plot all the stops
we use this drugstore brush on you you
cheat that's expensive right yeah they
have their own makeup brushes now all
right oh look at the gold mm-hmm that's
not it and then we're just gonna okay
yeah and there should be no miss getting
there's no burning now Shane does have
facial hair so we're just gonna do what
mani MUA does and just go over and
around what's the plan what do you want
me to look like who's my identity I want
you to feel like you're about to go on
drag race as the pretty girl of all the
attitude she goes from first I need to
be the weird underdog okay we're going
so now a 10-person foundation we're
gonna give you the full coverage and
moment today there's a lot of what would
you do mean there's a lot of bottles
here well what gravitates to you I think
I like yeah am i right this is my
favorite foundation of all time I'm not
kidding what is the oldest buck
you did not know that I didn't know
where to god I might make it was already
done when you got here this is Dior air
flash it's like a spray yes bitch paint
it out and then
we have to I like to make so I like to
do too
we're going to give you the world's most
expensive foundation this is $200
oh my god yep I did a review on this and
people were like what the is this
 and it's really good so what we do
here is to close our eyes okay okay
camera Dearborne first oh oh I like that
I like that
oh hold on don't open your eyes oh now
that's gonna look a little wild mm-hmm
we are going to take the foundation
cañedo
I mean you like that it's not vegan King
are like no what like don't do it we're
never to the poison control study I
already did no you didn't wait is about
okay now we're going to our dance with
Beauty Blender we're going to blend
Shane to Phil use your balls so we're
going to bounce and buff your entire
fade stuff it's like I'm our god
oh so I like to go on the ear so in
everything with matches okay never
forget the ears all right and as a
conceal Shane's life and soul we're
going to go in with the NARS soft matte
we're blending how do you feel about
things around your eyes I love it shove
a stick in my eye
okay good all right now it's time to
you've heard of baking right okay yes
we're going to bake the make up a little
bit so this is everywhere where we put
concealer we're just going to put loose
powder so it really assess it and
doesn't crease okay and today I'm using
the little dermablend loose setting
powder this is my favorite what does
this remind you of see I know you want
me to take cocaine but I wasn't cool
enough to do drugs you know I've never
tried it that imagines a powdered
doughnut I love that and I'm gonna all
right look at that you are looking so
mad like wow airbrush now we're gonna
cover everywhere we didn't do they're
highlighting and concealing we're gonna
go in with a little the devil perfection
luminaire from Chanel you don't even
have to face chin you look mean a lot of
people think that in person that may
have bad skin or I'm being real like a
lot of people think I ever broke my
video girl this is just like no that's
literally what you look like it's
 crazy all right
I really have been dying to contour you
and give you that just chiseled poker
type of vibe
so we're going to go in with the benefit
chic parade I'm obsessed with how to
smells
who's the guy who's best friends with
Kim Kardashian Oh Jonathan yeah we're
going to give you Jonathan cheekbones
right
so usually mani will start as beard line
so you know I don't do a lot of men have
facial hair so I'm going to start where
I think it would go oh yes have you ever
been doing somebody to make up and you
were just like oh there's no help
and you don't know what to do
yeah okay why are you sweating right now
reminder my old days at working at the
Mac counter someone would come in and
here's that girl
okay ready for smell this okay what's
that like a coconut
beachy bronzer yeah for joy does it yeah
a nice clean summery one debatable I
haven't had a vagina and literally have
you ever I've eared had sex with a girl
several really yeah how was it um this
spiritual have had sex with a few
woman's soul oh this is like 10 years
ago and I've had threesomes okay so you
know I'm you know we make out we you
know do other things and then no so you
eaten a before was this pact with
your old teeth I called a lot injuried
you shady
yeah those razors that I had thought
down uh-huh
okay now we're going now we're going to
contour this nose and we're going to
give you some surgery right now
some third yes but looking look straight
ahead look at that nose girl she's
looking so sad
the rocket has landed mm-hmm all right
now we're gonna do my favorite thing on
earth we're gonna highlight you oh this
is a hair part I love this okay I
love a blinding highlight I think it's
only fitting that we use the Eclipse
highlighter on you me and Manny's little
blinding moment
Oh mmm
give it to me we're gonna do full
highlight then if you're down yeah so
pretty look at that in the light way it
just shifts and moves oh by the way on
speaking of getting plans on the way
here I almost died on the freeway night
Y all somebody died
did you really grow like crazy and her
car went poof and then flipped and you
just like went to the side and I almost
I hit oh you didn't stop and check on
her Shh she's doing great
that's honest seem like this side of the
freeways you like for me at home like
okay that's crazy you know I look in the
back she was okay like she saw her did
her arm waving we just could have mean I
don't know what's that oh my god you
know this really so many accidents every
day in California
oh yeah why although my can everyone's
from different states so shouldn't you
be able to know how to drive that looks
like I just bit into a greasy Crunchwrap
yeah oh yes yes
okay to make sure that all the powder is
settled it's going to mend and blend all
together we're gonna do a little
settings break so close right okay
another blast to the face this is a
little more calming and soothing Jules
oh okay guys now we are about to move on
to eyes oh my god I think I thought you
could take some eyeshadow I'll take it
you can take it at all he's taken a lot
to his face throughout the years I think
they make up beading it can so we're
just going to go in a little Mac
painterly pauses to prime my lids kind
of look are you feeling today something
easy and breezy something like just like
go to Target get stared at okay so we're
going is the new sunset natasha banana
palette take a guess how much this baby
is Shane knows nothing about makeup you
guys are prices so this company is from
Israel and they make a really amazing
makeup what's the price for this guy uh
I want to send anybody it's okay it
looks cheap well cause of this just tell
me why okay from a from a doodler that
active let people know that that's like
when I get my box of macaroon the ship
the shade me like that a little where is
that one's chocolate though copy ignore
ah-so eyeshadow palettes usually range
from like twenty to forty dollars
this is 129 you should if it was that
expensive can't they just put the names
below them they can I don't know why
they don't everybody I know every brand
owner has a reasoning I'm not sure why
it's in here a lot of people actually
pull this thing out like I think you can
probably cut it out or rip it off it's a
little bizarre I know
so $429 you get these colors I'm selling
a little kind of sunset moment for you a
little spirituality and we're just going
to we're going to go right in with this
orange what's the name of her we got to
flip the danjo gas horizon Aikido does
we're using hot cheeto dust as the
crease color we're using puffy Cheetos I
and then we're going to do hot flaming
Cheetos in the creases all right now
we're going to go with the flamin hot
cheetos color called pan gin and we're
just going to darken the crease and just
let her have it I'm trying to picture
with no brows right now but you did a
drag transformation before right and
they covered your eyebrow your eyebrows
why not just jumps with Southern my
eyebrows are insane
sometimes I'll take an eyebrow off and
it'll be like longer than my pubes oh
the hair yeah it's like crazy I like
them have you ever gotten threaded or
like trimmed a long time ago I try and I
was crying yet what do we want to do
this one is so pretty or this one what
are you drawn to that is not one because
I feel like we've already seen that
we've seen her she's been done makeup is
messy mm-hmm like it looks gross no I
mean like it goes everywhere everywhere
like you guys think this is probably so
glamorous like this looks do not know
you should do a video where you show
that like what I'm going to pay off is I
know it rain is a while have you ever
put makeup on your penis like to be
funny um only when I better close his
eyes haha he's doing the thing when you
do one eye you're peeking it from the
other dogs right yeah I contour my shaft
a lot if I did that it would disappear
oh by kidding I'm going I'm sick wait we
what do you catch mark when it's
flopping or when it's hard when it's
hard and then when it's so then when it
goes back down right this looks really
like whoa good give me that longer that
we're in here not Walters big okay okay
so I'm putting on this metallic and
what's happened a little it well it
burns a lot no it doesn't but yeah like
it but is that normal because it's like
sparkly I mean it shouldn't hurt like
your eyes still inflamed yeah no they're
not watering like it burns no this one's
satyr you don't you can't see it my skin
is really sensitive like last night I
spilled a whole bottle of fireball on me
don't ask and I had it was like red and
crazy I may be into sensible okay all
right now we're gonna have you look up
actually and we're gonna stab you in the
eyes and do some water line mm-hmm your
eyes water for real like or no I don't
know see no straining to our eyeliner
every single day and we're just going to
give you a flashback of the old days
okay do you remember what eyeliner you
used to wear I never I wore one Oh
how does that feel take it take it
oh it's so pretty though we got one side
done if your water lane you're gonna fix
it up you lean back and we let the water
seep back into your skull or what I do
when I get sad every day huh let it
before you can take this dirty tissue
that you liked your hole with and yeah
and you can like take a little piece
like that and and lightly press it in if
you're only running water anymore there
we go okay now we're gonna smoke out the
under eye a little bit with how do you
how would you say that Sania Sania Sania
I'm gonna get in trouble
no and then we have volcano that's an
easy one we know volcano volcano Bermuda
atmosphere alright so we're going to use
the color that I don't have to pronounce
and we're going to have a hue look up
again a lot of looking up let me know if
you need to water or take a breather so
what is this
we're just smoking out down dry so it
looks really sultry
and just really accentuates your
feelings I'm curious how this is going
to end up because usually with makeup I
just look like an old lady okay like
like golden girls or what kind of lady I
feel like you're an old alcoholic aunt
who left her husband for a woman you
know mean mm-hmm I'm like sounds like my
family okay and quickly before we do
mascara I just want to say that I love
your eyebrows I think they're so cool
and I don't want to like emphasize them
because they're already like defined and
stunning so I don't want to make them
look like huge blocks of color on your
face so we're just going to let them be
natural today it is okay to be natural
you guys I mean look at me
okay now we're going to take my favorite
benefit roller lash and take these eyes
to the next levels we're gonna have to
look down not closed just like down
exactly like that when I was a little
fat kid all like please be like oh you
really should lose weight you have such
pretty eyelashes oh I would so lap
