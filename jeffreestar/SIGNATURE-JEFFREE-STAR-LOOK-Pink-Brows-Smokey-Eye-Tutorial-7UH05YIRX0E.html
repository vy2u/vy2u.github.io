today we're gonna be doing a really dark
dramatic sultry look with metallic glow
and a sneak peek at a new product so
have fun watching this and get ready for
something special
alright for brows today we're gonna go
back to the old school Geoffrey start
pink brow and I'm going to use a few
products that I've never used for the
brow before now I love honest top CEA's
dip brow so when I saw this cream color
in Barbie pink I was like who's gonna be
a good brown color now I love to draw
them on with a pencil first to try to
get the shape down so I'm going to be
using this OCC color pencil in shade
anime today and see what happens this is
a conte eyebrow you're adding a little
bit of pink gel brow powder over the
brows alright Wow we are good now move
on to eyeshadow all right for today's I
like I'm going to be using the Kat Von D
monarch palette and the Kat Von D shade
+ light eye palette now these are very
versatile and I'm mainly going to be
using this guy today
just like burnt orange Sienna color the
black one and then from this one we're
going to be using the lightest shade on
here and we'll dip into some of the
Browns you can get a really nice
chocolate I going
so first step that I always always do is
I take my Mac two by two brush and I'm
going to take the lightest shade here
and I'm just going to start packing it
on under the brow and I'm gonna take
this shade and pull it oh that's a grow
into my chat to you now I'm gonna take
this Gucci eyeshadow blending brush what
number is this number twenty before I do
any my black shadow I'm going to take
this burnt orange color I'm just going
to start blending it up and out
we want our eyesockets to look
airbrushed all times now we can move on
and start putting some dark soon
all right now I'm going to pack some
black shadow in there I'm use my Mac 217
brush now I love these black shadows
they are so pigmented I'm just going to
take this and start buffering it on my
lid now we all know I like to blow so I
blow on my brushes just like I said in
my last video do not blow on your
brushes if you're doing anyone elses
makeup you see if you have a client and
they see blowing is call me bad news
once this black is kind of laid down
here I'm going to take this Mac two to
four brush and just start to blend the
black up a little bit and choose that
orange color
time to do the under eyes or under my
eyes we were gonna darken them really
black now to do that I'm gonna use my
favorite Mac eyeliner this is called
smolder and we're just gonna lightly
pull this down and put some liner in the
waterline I'm going to drag this liner a
little below the lash line so I can
smoke it out and use it as my second
blending tool now this does not have to
be perfect because we're going to
probably put more liner later after we
put some shadow down there and blend it
out all right
the foundation of our liner down now we
are going to start smoking and buffing
it out now I'm going to use the same
black shadow as before but I'm also
going to be dipping in some Brown colors
might be using some honest Ossian
shadows for the bottom well we're going
to stick with the Kat Von D left shade
what I like to do is I'll dip my brush
into the black shadow so it's already
coated on the bristles and then I'm
going to go in and dip into the
chocolate shade so they are both on the
brush and then I am just going to
lightly start shuffling and color and
I'm going to bring it down so much your
eyes are really smoky to buff out the
under eye and help it look really
flawless I'm going to be using this tiny
morphe 5 1-3 brush I love to scorn it
perfect for detail and I'm just going to
take some of the chocolate shade by
itself and just lightly go over what I
just did there we go
all right under eyes are smoked out
alright I'm going to add some kind of
dark glitter to my lids now this is from
lit cosmetics I am
that's with this color it's called God
like a really cool almost like dirty
green like dirty money so I'm gonna be
putting this on with the Mac cream color
base this is shade Luna so I'm just
going to lightly apply this over my lid
and the glitter love others looking I
love putting glitter over dark shadow
video you don't have to do this step
just give you that extra light hmm oh
good morning hi ho all right now I'm
going to do some lashes to finish off
this eye look and of course I'm going to
go back to my Too Faced better than sex
mascara this is my favorite wand at the
moment and we're just going to coat them
before I'm any false lash all right time
to lashes and now before I do my lashes
I gotta take a quick little smoke break
here for a bit you always going to take
at least one amp before the lashes
because that's a stressful
situation girl now my favourite lashes
currently are Russian black from new bum
some I love this brand they are amazing
I'm gonna be using my vegan duo lash
glue this is my favorite give it a
little wave let it dry slightly and then
while it's drying I'm just going to
apply this on
to the different eyelash makes you guys
know I'm all about my metallic highlight
I want to be glowing from the
moon so we are going to be using Mac's
oh darling extra dimension skin finish
from their holiday collection I know
this sold out in like an hour in America
elf it just is crazy
so I'm just going to go right above my
contour and just start putting it I want
to make my cheek look like a beacon of
light hope now if you want to go crazy
which is why we're here right
we're going to add a little bit right
above the Cupid's bow and I like to
bring it slightly down so in photos your
lipstick is like BAM now if you want to
add a little bit of color to your cheeks
you can just for effect I'm going to be
using some tart blushes from their
holiday collection and I really like
this one called Dollface it's really
soft deep pink and I'm just going to
take my NARS kabuki brush I'm just gonna
kind of barely touch the cheeks just add
a little bit of color today alright nice
time president all right guys now today
is not just any hmm I wonder what
lipstick I'm gonna wear today is a big
moment for me next year in the spring

Geoffrey land I will be releasing a new
lipstick this is a satin finish lip it
is called lip ammunition and the formula
is satin creamy like this ship goes a
nice the shade is called X supermodel we
