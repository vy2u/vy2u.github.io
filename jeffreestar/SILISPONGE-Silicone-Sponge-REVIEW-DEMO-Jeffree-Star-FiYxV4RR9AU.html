channel now today I am really excited
because oh my god
now when I've been doing all these first
impressions lately I always ask you guys
at the end if there's anything that you
want me to try please leave your
comments below now the last few videos I
have never gone this many requests
before so of course you know when I
upload the video I'm reading on the
comment I saw so many tags of this silly
sponge like oh my god Geoffrey please
try this silicone like Beauty Blender
silicone sponge and I was like what the
fuck is going on around here so I hopped
on instagram and girl there is a brand
called moly cosmetics all the way from
Hong Kong and the owner created a
product which is I know you guys have
all heard and seen it by now it is a
sponge but it is made out of silicone so
it is basically not going to absorb your
products like a brush or a Beauty
Blender it is more sanitary you get more
uses out of it I don't know it's
supposed to be magical so bitch I hopped
online and you know you know this thing
had to get hurt now this thing reminds
me of the rainbow highlighter because oh
my god it was so hard to get ahold of
now I'm looking on their website and
they've done eight restocks I just think
it's really cool because this is a indie
brand that a lot of people have
discovered from Instagram for the owner
must be so overwhelmed from all these
orders so shout out to Molly cosmetics I
think it is so cool that you guys
created something that has exploded so
big so congrats on that today we're just
gonna do a little first impressions and
unbox this and we're just gonna try it
right on my bare skin now I have nothing
on except moisturizer so I'm serving you
lowered Voldemort realness today I am
gonna do primer just like I normally do
because I don't think it's fair to dry a
product on bare bare skin with
foundation and I don't do it like that
so we are going to apply a little bit of
primer now if I talk a little weird
today I was just in Atlanta and I got 12
stitches underneath in this lip right
here I have my teeth done now I have
temporary teeth on the bottom it's a
long story but basically I got crown
link
for any hygienist or dentists out there
and I am getting six of my teeth crown
so my whole entire mouth will be finally
done it's been a long fucking journey
but besides that I am in a little bit of
pain and there is stitches going
throughout my teeth so if you see
anything weird down here that's what's
going on so besides that you guys let's
dive right in now I want the primer just
sit on my skin for a minute so before I
open up the envelope and take everything
out I am just going to go in with my
usual primer this is the drill on gold
primer oh my god it's about time to
order me a new one so as you guys know
by now I like to apply this with a
little synthetic foundation brush he and
I'm just going to do it like I normally
do and coat that all over my skin
all right so while this primer is
settling into my skin we're going to
open up this guy now I just cut this
with scissors and open it so it comes in
a envelope like this and it says that it
is coming all the way from Hong Kong so
when you open it it comes in a s
envelope it comes in a little black
nylon bag with the product inside and I
got two of them all right now it comes
with this little card it says Mali
Cosmetics and then also in the back you
guys it says that it's cruelty free
paraben free 100% love and it just says
their website other side is their logo
and then inside is a cute little message
thank you for your support love Molly
sponged you better work and let's get to
what you all really want to see here is
what it comes in it is in a cute little
bag almost reminds me of when I go to
the dispensary and I pick up some weed
yes ma'am
now I'm gonna just open it up like I'm
nervous I've seen as so many like images
of us all over the Internet oh yes
here she is so here is this sponge that
went viral I'm gonna call it sponge
because that's just whatever else is
calling it obviously a sponge soaks in
product and this one is not supposed to
do that so it basically looks like a
little chicken cutlet like a little raw
thing I know there are a lot of people
that have been using bras to find a dupe
for this um I don't have any bra cutlets
handy sorry but we are going to try this
one and we're gonna see how that works
so it comes like this it is about hmm I
don't know me Internet is because I'm
used to like 9 or 10 inches but um it's
cute it's a little let's compare it to a
dry Beauty blender on my table here so
here is the comparison cute of course
when this is wet this will expand now I
guess the final tea is we got to try
this damn thing now foundation you guys
that was a tricky thing for me exact you
guys know I have a lot of favorite
foundation so I'm looking on my table
what do I want to use okay I think I was
gonna go in with the Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation I've been using
this for about two and half years now
and it does require a shake so I've seen
it different techniques using this to
apply now I'm just going to go on their
website really quickly I always do that
during these videos because I want to
know what is exactly gonna happen now it
says wasting products is a history now
of course it doesn't soak up a thing the
foundation needed is literally half the
amount compared to using a brush or
sponge oh that's going to be interesting
we'll see if it uses the same amount of
product or not and it says spreading
product will take some getting used to
but final blending can always be
finished with a brush or a normal sponge
well I'm gonna try doing this with my
entire face without using something else
because that's what we're here for right
and it also says cleaning this is a lot
easier it's minimal a lot of people okay
cool
sorry I'm like ready to roll I'm like
I'm excited am i great thank you for the
fucking message I'm ready to roll so
I've seen a video on their website they
actually posted one which thank God
because I was like how am I supposed to
do this basically you are going to
spread it around and then kind of Pat it
in so I think it's time to of course try
this out all right guys it says to use
half the amount so do do it fun sponge
to your face now we're just gonna we're
just gonna try this and then it has
double N so I'm like do you use which
side you use I guess we can use both for
and see what happens
so we're just gonna use a little bit I'm
scared y'all okay
BAM let's try this out okay so I'm just
going to just kind of put it around oh
wow
okay so when you're doing that well oh
okay so of course spreading it around
does look a little streaky right off the
bat but I'm going to lets buff it in Oh
could anyone else hear that it sounds
like um hold on hold on one turn up the
volume on your phone or computer and
tell me what this sounds like I mean I
don't know about you guys it sounds like
Nathan's clock stopping me but hey
different opinions right okay so besides
that amazing noise I'm kind of living
for honestly um I'm just gonna buck this
in oh okay so now that I'm patting it
into the skin it is definitely put on my
lips to spreading out way easier now
that literally covered usually I use
like five or six pumps I'm just going to
be really honest and for two pumps that
got like half of my face I'm like
pleasantly surprised okay obviously we
got to keep going I'm gonna try the
other side just for fun because hi let's
see what happened so now we have it on
the other side huh look it looks like a
bleeding heart okay here we go
now only thing that's a little weird is
like you see that part of my nose that
it didn't get you kind of have to like
really go in to get all the like
crevices and corners of my face so the
other side appears to be working the
same as the other I'm looking close up
now oh wow okay okay I need a little bit
more to finish the forehead and neck so
we're gonna go in
uh alright only spot that I haven't
gotten yet and that it really is kind of
hard to reach is the eyelids I always
put foundation on my lids so I'm just
gonna try to Pat the lid I guess Pat my
crease there's not really any product
left so I'm just gonna take the tiniest
amount like that and try to get on my
lid oh my god Sam we got some baby will
make us in progress oh it's actually
just fit right into your eye right there
you see that okay
all right I think that this is all
blended into my skin let's take a closer
look okay so you know every time I do a
first impressions I never know what to
expect I never go into a scenario really
like expecting to like or hate anything
I always come in with an open mind so
when I saw you know this going all over
the internet I was like okay we've seen
a lot of these things before is it
really gonna work I am pleasantly
shocked I'm looking in the mirror and
I'm like okay like the foundation
blended and I haven't touched up or done
anything off camera it's just straight
from the vasila sponge and I'm like oh
my god it like I keep going over my eyes
cuz I'm so like meticulous but I'm like
it worked
it mother-effing worked okay now what I
normally use this and buff out my
foundation and left someone told me and
made it I would never like thought to
use this so um girl I think we got
something on our hands today I'm looking
close up in this mirror you guys in life
it looks like I normally looks like I
normally do my makeup like nothing looks
different which I'm so shocked I'm like
so I think what I want to do right now
is just for fun I want to add some
concealer and powder with a brush and
just to see how the foundation looks
after because you guys know you never
know oh my god I haven't used this in a
minute let's just apply this real
quickly oh my god have you guys now that
summer is over I feel like I've gotten
pale
look at this concealer it's like my
foundation call it really let's just
make an arrow right down to my fucking
filthy mouth hi now you know right did
last time which I really enjoyed was
using the little artiste brush just
brushing is on my chin
why is it already done I'm like oh that
took two seconds now I'm sure a lot of
you were like why don't you blend out
your concealer with that still a sponge
it really just set us for a foundation
so I'm gonna apply my concealer and
powder how I normally do and then we're
just going to see how the foundation
looks if anything's changed or looks
weird and then we're gonna give our
final thoughts oh my god you guys I've
put on a lot of concealer alright I am
just going to quickly powder these under
eyes and set that concealer the Lord I
don't think that you can set concealer
with that silicon sponge so girl I'm
just going to use his powder puff
alright now I think the last thing I
want to do is just put on some powder
foundation I'm just going to grab the
Studio Fix and this is what I normally
do after I buff everything I just twist
some more foundation that is a powder
version on top so we seal everything and
my face is like ready to go for an
all-day explosion all right guys I think
it is time to finally give our final
thoughts alright so I mean I was really
really happy with how this turned out
now I never imagined blending out my
foundation with silicone I can't believe
it's finally been created I think that
is so cool that in any brand has done
something that the whole internet is
talking about in the beauty community so
yeah um I love it I think it worked
really well I'm looking in the monitor
you know I always say this I'm leaning
in the monitor like oh my god but it
actually worked like the skin is
beautiful it blended now of course it
was a little weird at first to kind of
slather it around until it kind of like
settled it was almost like a magic trick
where I'm like wait it looks streaky
then all of a sudden it's settling fine
and once you patted the found
in the skin it turned out and blended
amazing so I actually really recommend
you guys have to try this
um now these are really easy to clean
and disinfect of course we all know
sponges can get mold after time and of
course you got to throw them out now
this one says if there's any tears into
the outer I guess silicone that that's
when you have to change them out so of
course it's a lot less frequent and I'm
like oh my god this is so easy to travel
with you don't got a wet or do anything
I'm sure alright the final thing that I
have to say is that the scylla sponge is
Jeffrey star approved work thank you
