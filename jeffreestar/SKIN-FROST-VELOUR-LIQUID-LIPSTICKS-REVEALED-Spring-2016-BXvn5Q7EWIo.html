channel today we're doing something
really exciting and fun
we are swatching my new liquid lips tiny
liquid lips and we are doing finally my
skin Frost highlighting powders so today
I brought the executive assistant to
jeffree star cosmetics this is my
assistant Alisha hi guys now we go back
we go back so our bad she was my road
manager when I was doing music for the
last 4 years when I was signed with Akon
if you guys only know me through makeup
if you ever want to Google me in the
music world you guys do that we'll talk
about that on a whole nother video but
I'm in shoes to be my road manager and
we've been to things girl so I started
from the bottom now yeah so I think the
main problem with a lot of makeup brands
they never swatch on anybody but white
bitches so I brought someone with
gorgeous caramel skin to help showcase
my liquid lips and highlighters so
exciting to be the first woman of color
to wear the powders guys must see the
swatches on my hand
they look so overly amazing on my skin
tone you guys are gonna be so excited
about what's to come good eye and
they're not ready I don't think you got
the ring we hope you guys enjoy these
swatches and if you want to see some
debauchery and some glamour keep on
watching so the first color we're gonna
swatch for you today is by um Rose
madder now I Instagram this with me like
a few weeks ago and everyone was like
bitch what is that color this me gray is
so pretty like I was in the lab and I'm
like I gotta make like a it's like a
softcore Lee pink brown toned nude
whatever the you want to call it I
think this is gonna look good on every
skin tone skin tone for sure sure and
now if you're afraid to wear it alone
you can always throw a darker lip liner
but as you all know opaque full-coverage
you don't need a lip liner so we're
gonna swatch this one first
so now all of these new colors and the
nude family will all smell like root
beer float and in the description box
below I will tell you guys which ones
have flavor and which ones do not case
you all forget
so Kunti couldn't secant secant is it
you are you loving it so overly amazing
you guys see this
let me see on you huh I'm dying so happy
to be the first black girl with it on it
looks flawless Pacifico flawless alright
let's watch the next color the second
shade is Gemini hi Gemini now I named
the shade after one of my best friend's
brandy she's a crazy Gemini hi now this
color is like a warm terracotta nude I
recently put this up on my website when
we had a restock there was it was gone
20 seconds I was like oh my god the wind
it was sure it was done so it was like
what we had just put it up for fun
no one knew it was coming out no best
thing since sliced bread dead gone so
this will be back very soon and you
better be quick because the shinbone
apply so we're gonna swatch it for you
this is for anyone anytime anyplace for
sure it's like an easy color that like
anyone could wear to work to an orgy to
Walmart every day all day
I made this color on mine for like
everybody to wear like literally all day
every day no matter corporate no matter
what you do for a living
it's a colony it's a good everyday color
so if you're afraid of the blues and the
black lipstick get my someone over you
for sure now the third shade is called
mannequin I have been holding out on
this one for a minute like no one has
seen this shade yet it's like it's for
like in the ball I'm like a shoe come
out already so mannequin was inspired by
plastic like amazing just doll heads
like I love I have mannequins in my
house I have a million wig heads and
ever since like the old days when I
first started people are always like you
look like
Anakin so this is definitely inspired by
that this is kind of like a mix of
celebrity skin I'm nude almost like a
hybrid but very different than those two
it kind of sits in the middle so I'm
nudes to light for you definitely try
this are they perfect
and before we swatch this guarana to hit
girl please fire up please I thought you
would never come
Thank You Nathan for packing us this
beautiful Bowl look at that eyeball girl
yes ma'am so awesome makes everything
better
hahaha second blow baby oh I'm sweating
now this one her wedding this is a
secret weapon why someone like a condo
where two condoms an extinct bird huh
can you see Manny King so good you know
it's so cool about makeup is this color
looks so different me in you but it's so
versatile like I was afraid you wouldn't
be able to pull it off later on it was
made for you
Carol I need to just get over myself
please
okay so this next color you guys you
guys have seen it before i've swatched
on snapchat it finally has a release
date rich blood this basically has the
blood of all your favorite celebrities
inside of it now this one is a little
different than my usual formula I do
want to tell everybody that it's a tiny
bit more mozi because there's fine
Mika's of glitter in this so I don't
think a lot of brands talked about that
but once you start adding in pigments
with glitter and all the Mica's it can
definitely change how the formula works
so this one is just a tiny bit moosie i
know when i put out a color like this
during holiday called hohoho I got a lot
of people like this is a little
different than your normal formula same
long lasting power but it just feels a
little different Lucy let's watch it
awesome is slide
and so easily welcome to our swatch
party how do you feel about rich blood
nigga it's good right so freakin good
you see it this is Geoffrey star 101 of
how to be a real bad bitch yes ma'am
now the cool thing about this one is if
you want to activate the glitter inside
the product let it completely dry and
then lightly rub super glitter comes
forth a little bit kind of activates it
easy breezy beautiful and last but not
least I know the shade already came out
with my holiday collection now the
demand was real girl cream I had never
gotten as many emails like androgyny as
I did for rights that work okay like
literally I wore it every day you're
like a bitch sent me a new one every
rose how crazy I am about pink and I
hate the color P but I know you don't
like bright you don't like neons really
but you like this is like a perfect bang
for you is so perfect and when once you
see us apply this baby you're gonna
totally agree I'm really obsessed now
this one oh it's finally coming back I
think it's coming back and stock like
next week so you don't follow me on
snapchat and IG for the latest updates I
would start doing that if you want the
colors it's the easiest way to find out
when they're back in stock recently
let's watch it so many men love this
color Oh me uh-huh
men don't give a about lipstick
they really don't know about we they
care about what you can do with your
lips but not the lip color but changes
the whole game they really love this
color now I want to make a note this one
does not have Revere smell as no
fragrance it's just that normal like raw
ingredients I'm taking forever because
I'm looking at her mouth on the monitor
and I'm like
a mess that looks perfect on you that's
a great mouth girl
alright you guys now I have been
previewing my skin frost highlighting
powders for months now I know you all
are like bitch where the hell is it it's
finally coming out towards the middle of
May or maybe towards the end of May I
know I always kind of like balance my
release dates you guys basically when
you manufacture makeup through a company
it takes a it takes a while so I think a
lot of people forget when you aren't any
brand and things are selling out quickly
and you're growing it's kind of hard to
catch up so I'm ordering more and more
and more every single time and the
demand is growing so which is an amazing
beautiful problem to have but I know it
frustrates some of you so I'm not going
to say the exact date yet but if you
follow me on IG or snapchat you will be
the first to know it it comes in a
really big compact has a unique formula
there is no talc in these I know a lot
of highlighters have talc in it which is
not a bad thing some of my eyeshadows
will in the future but for highlighters
I don't just don't think it's necessary
so I'm gonna ruin the J right now and
touch it now these are really really
highly pigmented when I say a little
goes a long way you guys and they'll
goes a long way I'm just going to swatch
this on my hand and now let me swatch it
on your hand
it's your glow in bitch you're glowing
so I'm gonna swatch two highlighters on
her cheeks and two on mine now I'm going
to be taking shade peach goddess that we
just watched with a morphe 510 brush and
you really need to only go over it a few
times like that's it you don't need a
lot of product of course if you guys
want to glow from the damn moon please
pile it on so as you can see instant
mother-effing glow whoa I'm going to
take this all the way back because we
want to look like plastic Barbies and
now this is really light for her skin
tone but I think with the bright lips
I'm a cup she can definitely pull it off
but we will show you a darker shade
right now all right now the second shade
I'm revealing is this a beautiful tan
gold called King Tut now I hate ruining
that chaste
I hate ruining the J's in the pants and
I'm like I don't want to do it so
special
all right let me swatch this one this
one is so much product Oh like girl you
don't need you don't need much oh I'm
dying it feels great on my hand oh my
god it's like butter huh
and there is King Tut on my hands all
right now I'm gonna swatch King chat on
her left cheek
oh she's glowing I'm gonna take this all
the way up like hello 80s we're having a
David Bowie moment are you living here
look in the mirror oh she's been here
she's hard it's not like on the monitor
to me you guys it looks like really
bright I think we have so many Beauty
lights nice is ice really bling in but
she's been here before
girl yes I want to glow Oh BAM so
exciting do you guys see how big this is
I don't think they understand how long
they're gonna see how big it is girl all
right and the third shade is ice cold
now I know I have worn these in a few
tutorials and everyone's like what is
this coming out ice cold
is for really pale people I get ahead of
all the time please make highlighters so
when I started the process I asked you
guys what did you guys want me to make
and I got so many people that were like
my skin is so fair
no one has highlighters I created a
really like winter frosty this is way
too light for her but the cool thing
about these powders you guys is they are
safe
for the entire face and body so we wet
and make a brush the other day and I
used it on my entire lid bitch that
was blingin ice-cold maybe
so I'm gonna swatch this on the right
side of my cheek right now whoo oh my G
is so chilly so this is just straight
like platinum ice for your face my dust
my nose a little bit
I'm gonna give myself a little highlight
like come on Barbie girl she is there

fourth color

highlighters bitch now the blue one is
coming out in another like month and a
half I'm rolling out a lot more colors
