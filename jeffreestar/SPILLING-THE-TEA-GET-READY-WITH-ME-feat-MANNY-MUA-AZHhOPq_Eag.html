I love it one is and over money hacks no
condom no no no protection we're going
to do a get ready guys we have tons of
new different products so you want try
out we wanted to kind of sit down into
tattoo like there's been a lot of going
on in our lives like so long happening
at March I just came out wearing some
very now yeah yeah like the whole chrome
collection from the summer collection
like this just a lot of things yeah are
collapse coming back next month it is
there's a lot going on so we're
basically and and there's been so much
drama like my botox is wearing off and
having gotten yet we are going to spill
the fucking team in today's video while
getting ready if we even can yeah
honestly I'm like pray we can literally
just try to get ready right now saying
I'm not gonna focus on the makeup I'm
just gonna talk okay good so and it also
you guys after you're done watching this
head on over to a man news channel we
did something really wild I've never had
my mouth open for that long picture I
think yeah as a so Wiz it we don't even
recall you on a mouthguard challenge the
we they say something challenge out the
speak out we got our challenge we
basically put those crazy plastic
dentistry trays in our mouths and the
graphics bugs the rest of history
exactly are you guys so if you want to
see us get ready and spill the damn key
and keep on watching
okay so proprietor where Manny's never
tried this before I've been using it for
a while as you can see this is from the
brand touch and soul then the name makes
me want to read it as a creative but
it's called no pores Loman
like no problem before yeah Donna
convergence really a you know portal um
I make you just violate it I don't like
it at a smooth and poor covering primer
it's amazing and it probably has more
silicone on my face
shuffle what if you saw guys please
though it made me fucking ton oh that
too much nothing it's fine got a big
fuckin face and then is it smell really
like it was really good come on I'm not
fucking playing you have a favorite baby
people with me watching your favorite
video is actually in my July favorites
I'm hooked crazy there's so many primers
like coming out lately it's like every
brand is like coming out it's just my
breath smell it too many things in
general they are it's a lot as
overwhelming you can throw that whatever
like brands are coming out with so much
stuff it's just way too overwhelming I
hate it and on a feed us I think to like
I don't be shady or anything but I think
also like a lot of people are coming out
different brands like so much and I out
and I also feel like the people how much
ok randoms I know I want to take the new
milk foundation ok so try out yes but I
feel like people are pointing to like
you look I would make a brand but
they're not passionate on me good let me
tell ya like I feel like it's not I
wanted a talk with money yeah the quick
bar and that's getting me noise it's
like what about all of us who actually
care about me doesn't actually care
about like the well-being of consumers
right now it's I'm going I don't break
my own break make a brand and it's like
I'm working so hard and doing everything
I can to make it perfect yes but like
and as well so there's different like
ways to create a brand there's someone
like me or you or honest ostia or other
in like people that started from the
ground up or up to that create yes of
course i'm laura that create from the
ground up and it's not just like what
people call like a private label where
you just go into a lab and they already
have everything done and you just like
oh yeah I want this mess and this and
like 20 brands all have the same thing
this is like actual we're really working
with the lab we're creating real colors
custom everything I think that's the big
difference
oh come on no yeah
how's it again come on okay wait real
quick I'm going to go in with the
brand-new YSL beauty all ours foundation
I use it only once so far and I'm a fan
okay I'm gonna put this damn foundation
on my foundation I normally go in with
over that over this
my fucking wiping it off long time to
wipe off well this was supposed to be a
really full coverage oh I know you're
going for tribal one other thing I
wanted to say randomly I've seen she's
like a random thing I was noticing like
so people coming out brands right like
they're following their dreams yeah
Kevin England being like something like
people coming out to that and I know for
a fact are not like really having
leverage and they don't wanna go client
that's annoying to me but I also think
it's really frustrating when I see
people like hating on them for coming
out with their own brand because they
acid and they they still are following
their dreams yeah becoming older or like
they're doing their own thing and it's
like why do people have to hate on
someone falling with wires internet so a
damn ugly y'all that's what I want to
know Chloe I just don't get it and I
know I think I joined you too but it's
such a crazy time agree mmm oh my god
I'm a year and a half in and I'm like my
head spinning like thank you alright so
what the graphics from my kitchen and we
haven't tried these yet
these are the colour-pop no filter
concealer mm-hmm the nudies literally
just launched they should also with like
they came out with like highlighting
palette not like a lot of standards like
how the tons everything i mean i love
color cloth but they put out so many DM
skews i know that it's so affordable so
they kind of get away with it definitely
but it's again let me enjoy the the
eyeshadow pot my highlighter palette i
one thing i think is like my annoyance
about that matrix too often it loses its
charm it does it's a lot alright so i'm
going to go in with show you spare five
it is like the lightest shade I think
I'm going with light neutral which is 15
okay let's a bit of world on foreigners
receiving face board if it dries too
quickly and only ones I rude wait I said
blend oh look look at that coverage like
over your tattoos oh okay alright now
let's set this damn concealer
actually really liked it I did show but
I noticed that like it is falling it's
my fine line the wrinkle so you'd have
to set it pretty quick I'm assuming it
is for to not be able to fall in because
why do you like it
I set the concealer so Manny told me to
pick this up out of my drawer I haven't
use this yet
like I just like I've been getting so
much product lately I'm like overwhelmed
I love it I really hope you looking
feminine and mine brand-new and I use
the site this VT as well okay so there's
a cream contour side mm-hmm okay and I
like a really bright highlight it was
dark it works on me félicité even
works on me okay a little dark for you
but what if it was not nice okay the
thing okay let me our each let me just
try this before I do the whole face am
really sheers out with a Beauty Blender
I mean I was probably absorbing a little
bit of product and I would do powder
over anyway obviously to set it Oh same
look I'm not mad at this my cheekbones a
car there Q there's one side it lower
the norm honesty looks really good on
your I can see it like it looks nice
okay cool it's soft I love that
that's so pigmented has become such a
thing oh my god okay you guys you look
so crazy is I like when you're with your
best friends you all talk alike you all
get the same funny things wrong we all
do that and Manny like that's just his
thing I just do more than others
he doesn't he does it with everyone and
I never noticed filming so when I mean
we have so many videos together more
than four you really took their time I
know like I've never liked and I
remember it's kind of cool to look at
your book you get to like see all the
videos we film yeah oh definitely sounds
a lot
yeah it's turning to this crazy viral
thing it's a circus guys it's so funny
to go on peoples channels and see like
summer in the comments section of
they're not even baby like I don't at
all and it's literally just it's like
they're talking to me because Manny
repeating the same thing and I'm like
huh where did this come right now it's
already funny I love it it's cool I did
too I think it's so fun to like guys
it's so fun to make fun of yourself with
why take life so seriously you guys that
it is so what nice to make fun yourself
why take life so serious
[Laughter]
the concealer has like fine line that's
what I was saying about mine look at
that look at my fuckin eyes I don't look
they look like that no but when it
blended out and the one I said it and
kind of not living no offense like what
who fucking cares I'm offending anyone
it's just I'm like oh yeah my under eye
wrinkles are gnarly right now they look
I don't I'm not look and so or might
even like my smiling wrinkles like
they're usually not too tight either all
right
well many is a little bronze I'm about
to bronze up a tiny bit mate has emerge
ages wonders July I live for this I'm so
bummed that was a limited edition and I
don't even people get this again no idea
they look at that maybe but you know
it's really you know it's really fucked
up I may have bought in like two months
before Colleen judaics ago yeah you're
going that rent okay so open out money
if I like something I'm like I'm scared
no I know I would love this I love at
this bronzer color alright so we're
going to dip into this I've never tried
this before I have powder so so
pigmented okay it was really powdery to
not powdery something be tried but
definitely contouring Oh like subculture
it kind of crazed how the witch hunt has
gotten so severe for a brand new bat
though like I think it's so stupid that
people have gone to this level yeah now
I get everyone out there wants to know
is a palate good or not obviously a lot
of us had proven that there was a lot of
problems with it it was inconsistent who
knows that the lab had issues obviously
there was the issue every single
youtuber is going ham about all of them
well most their forefront beauty brand
that's what it is like they're at one of
the frontrunners when it comes to
anything beauty like their there's no
denying it they're one of the biggest on
social media yes they are and they had a
fuckin and they had a fuck to polish it
make it happen not everyone is gonna
have the best launches ever but I think
when they've had such a good track
record I think it was shocking to people
about like a modern renaissance was so
successful here's the follow up which I
looked back at them once a year yes
later someone and I think a lot of
people were just kind of like really
really shocked people cats like seeing
like all the modern responses super
powdery to I said yeah it is powdery I
said I'm I review it it's super powdery
but it blends
when I know so I don't know what
happened at the end of the day obviously
we stick by our reviews but I love the
brand there's one palette that we didn't
love this I mean okay all of a sudden
they're cancelled like that's a problem
with the internet and people are just so
aggressive
it'll ready to jump on like a bandwagon
yeah that's the problem we hate them oh
my girl you're gonna be wearing a new
shit when it drops next month
come on half the people that he does
don't even know why they hate us they
just find because everyone else does sad
it's so fuckin different although Ruthie
that's just some real shit like a big
okay it's funny cuz I always feel like
this like whenever people would meet me
in person like even if I could hater
maybe in person I'm sure they were
actually enjoy like the experience it
wouldn't it be like I'm really nice and
like all these things and people would
want to make it seem like I'm gonna be
uh huh do it I'm gonna be like a
complete ass I'm like oh I know I get
that you and my grommets just I'm just
I'm just one little person on this earth
tryna live and it's just I think there's
one day here's one little person
just one little little horrible but yeah
the internet has just been so brutal
lately you guys since I've entered the
YouTube realm I've never read or seen or
been abused by so much hate and in my
comments and people in general and I get
that that's what comes with success
because everyone out there watching has
shown us so much love and it's just
something he's going to do with ya okay
we're going to quickly do blush before
we run our mouths and we're going to go
in with the new Saharan blush volume 2
from Julia's please M hmm I've never
used this yet I worked it beautiful I
ordered it myself
looks really really pretty I know this
color hello kids look at that look see
have a look on the face so I held a deep
yesterday and we all talked about how
being on solution we have been like
biggest blessings of our lives and how
we're so lucky to be in the place that
we are by it it's crazy because we
struggle so much more now against so
much more anxiety we have so much more
things to worry about then that we had
like no money no hood sex no nothing and
that's some real shit that maybe a lot
of people don't take it wrong when he
does that you guys I think a lot of
people think that money equals I mean
real happiness it doesn't at all no it's
amazing to be able to provide for our
family I think a lot of people got it
twisted they just see only fine jewelry
in cars a little girl I bought my mom a
house me and Nate bought his parents
house I've gotten to help my cousins who
are struggling in college by them you
know car then it's like it's just so
fulfilling to be able to help the ones
you love and donate to charity yes
I mean Manning is donating to charity a
lot and definitely you know trying to
show that that's okay to promote as well
as yeah people love to talk about drama
all the time but you know if I donate or
do anything and promote it no one wants
to talk about it yeah it's not hot
gossip it's not hot news it's what you'd
be like person that's not interesting
and it's not fun what he's actually he's
actually nice like people just focus on
so much negativity a lot I guess online
and I hate saying that on my channel cuz
most people out there obviously watching
us enjoy us love what we're doing and
they support us but there's a lot of
people that don't and as if this brand
and life and career grows it's hard to
kind of stay sane sometimes oh my god
and no one talks about this you guys so
many people want to put up a front and
they're all fraud you like oh my god I'm
so happy all the fucking time it's like
no how you're not though like on the
realest level like no I don't know
anyone says like after you having years
and years and years of hate every single
day like it affects you in some way and
then Tom tryman says I might you can say
there's affect you all you want or try
to act like a front like you're like go
on fine it's not just sometimes it can
be really rough people are so vicious
side no I love this blame really Britt

a little bit too pink my necklace is
mine it looks really pretty actually
here's mine
this looks great maybe needs to be black
Glenda slightly more yeah it's it was
like kind of like anybody that kind of
sticks you have to kind of go in oh this
one I feel like also is like almost like
like it drives down like Matt but has a
shiny finish quickly we're really fun to
mix in with Body Lotion
or okay I'm fixing it I do my looks my
looks more blended but there's looks
more like oh oh why is the mine
blendings at the Beautyblender you have
a different sponge yeah mine went like
straight and it's not blending down and

other day before I went out and I loved
