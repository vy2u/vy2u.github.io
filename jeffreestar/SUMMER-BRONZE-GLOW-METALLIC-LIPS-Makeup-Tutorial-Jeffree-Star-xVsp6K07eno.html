wait besides that let's jump into this
look to prep the skin we're going to be
using the Tasha dewy skin mist just
start and then we're gonna do some
moisturizer so we're just gonna give us
a little shake we're gonna get this skin
snatched glowing and ready for the beach
so just do a healthy handful now let's
get started first we're gonna be taking
this Becca backlight primer now this has
like iridescent in it and it is so
pretty high she's been used a lot I love
this one we're just gonna do a little
bit on our damp Beauty Blender and I'm
just going to drag this all around and
coat my entire face and I'm even gonna
put them on my ears because my ears are
always like hi can I go next please
thank you if you want you can stop here
and
you're ready but of course huh we're far
from ready all right now foundation
today I am gonna go a little darker than
normal because I am so fair so I'm gonna
be using my Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation this is amazing you can
actually wear this by itself if you want
for a really natural look this builds
really nicely so it can go from medium
to full if you really want to layer it
I'm also gonna take my L'Oreal
infallible Pro glow foundation which I
reviewed the other day and I actually
really loved it it's cool because it
gives you just a little boost of like a
like a tan like I'm just so fair I
definitely want to warm up my skin just
a little bit so I'm actually going to be
mixing these two so I'm just gonna take
a few pumps on the back of my hand here
and then we're gonna mix in a little bit
of the pro glow and you guys know me
I'll take an eyeliner a safety pin I
don't care what it is and I'll just mix
this come on BAM we don't want to waste
that foundation honey you can use a
Beauty Blender I think that is one of my
favorite methods or you can also take
these artiste brush which I love and
this really does it quickly for you so
I'm going to take a Beauty Blender first
and I'm just gonna top this all over the
face now we're going to go back with the
old eight brush and we are just going to
brush on that foundation
now I'm gonna go in with a really light
concealer I'm going to be using the new
Too Faced Born This Way concealer this
is heaven ever since I tried it the
other day I've been using it every
single day that I've gotten ready and
I'm like what's up girl this is in shade
fair so we're just going to take a
little bit and AM we're gonna go down
the nose today and then we're just going
to do a little concealer here we'll do a
little heart on my forehead today just a
little the smile lines to brighten that
up let's get to buffing and blending I'm
going to be taking that our T's oval 7
and we're just gonna brush this out
concealer is done now I definitely want
to set my under eyes a little bit
because I do have a lot of makeup on so
before I do a little contour I'm just
gonna take my damn Beauty Blender now
this one is really soap and I'm just
gonna hit in there once and then you're
gonna take that and just go right under
the eyes now we're gonna do a little
cream contour today I know I don't
normally do that but for this look I
want those cheekbones cut like razor
blades so I'm pulling at my Laura
Mercier contour palette I love this one
the contour deep shade number three is
the darkest one and I'm just going to go
in there with a little Mac synthetic
brush we're just gonna do our cheekbones
a little different today I know you guys
are like yeah oh my look at that new
shape notice how I'm not going down and
aggressive I'm just kind of going more
up and high so we're gonna look really
elevated today I love to do under the
jawline you guys and then we're really
gonna go in on this nose today we're
gonna really minimize that forehead and
look like I chopped it in half of course
when this blends out is not gonna look
this crazy this is just kind of giving
me a guideline of what we're about to do
so of course if you want to leave it
like this and go out of the house and
you're very welcome to do that but today
we're going to take our damp Beauty
Blender and get to bouncing and now if
you want you can also go back in with
these brushes and they're gonna brush
out your contour and actually blend it
really nicely so I actually love going
back and high bronze and of course
you're going to keep on blending so it
doesn't look as crazy and severe
all right now the fun part the nose
we're just going to take this beauty
blender and we're gonna squish it so it
is really thin and we're just gonna go
up and down and bounce away oh my nose
is so pinched I could barely breathe
right now all right
contour is complete now I am gonna take
a little bit of some loose powder to
dust around my face and I'm gonna try
something new today I got the new lemare
which hi one of my favorite skincare
brands ever this is that lemare the
powder the component is so pretty it is
really big so I'm just gonna put some in
here alright powder now I also have a
new brush that comes with it look how
big this brush is I'm just gonna slap
one side of my face with it
oh my god this brush feels like mmm I
don't even know how to describe it's
like the softest brush I have ever felt
on my face before the face is set that
powder looks so velvety I'm like mmm now
I'm just gonna draw on some brows
off-camera and I'll be right back
now I'm going to be priming my lids with
a YSL Couture eye primer this one is
amazing it's kind of like the Mac
painterly so pick your poison I'm just
gonna coat my entire lids with this mmm
for really frosty soft eyes I'm going to
be pulling out my lorac unzipped gold
palette this has so many gorgeous tones
for this look that I'm like oh hi I'm
going to be dipping in to unwind this is
like a matte taupe color and I'm just
going to tuck this into my crease and
kind of make this a little transition
color so I'm gonna go really light on
this and I'm just gonna go right in
there
now I'm not gonna take it all the way in
like I all like I you know always do I'm
just gonna softly blend up and out this
is gonna be the softest crease you will
ever see me do now notice I'm just gonna
stop kind of right there and just do a
little halo around the I know I'm gonna
take a little flat synthetic brush and
I'm gonna coat my lids with this
unleashed shade it is so pretty oh wow
okay
you never know I'm like oh wow this is
like intense oh I'm all shocked on
camera I'm like oh so I'm gonna take
this and bring it all the way down in
there I'm just going to take this brush
and actually dip into Unleashed as well
and I'm just gonna take it over that
matte color we did earlier wow that is
like blinding and I like it now I'm
gonna really change up the look by
dipping into this Kat Von D shade +
light eye palette and I'm just going to
take a flat synthetic brush and go into
the lightest shade in here I'm gonna
take this below my brow and make it just
really highlighted for extreme shine I'm
gonna take one of these steel at
magnetic magnificent eye these are like
metal in a jar I'm literally just gonna
press this into the tiny bit on my lid
oh wow yes this is like extreme which is
exactly how I like it
okay and now to even put more on top of
this I know you guys are like what more
you better slow it down I can't
I found this reflex glitter what shade
is this this is from like an old Mac
Wonder Woman collection now uh hi that
packaging is so cute this is like a
really bronzy like sparkle glitter
I don't even want to wet the brush
because it might look insane so let me
just try it dry first we're just gonna
press it on oh oh wow
this looks like bronze glass well I know
what I'm wearing every day for summer
Humber's packing more and more on I'm
like I can't stop let me get off any
shimmer that is on me this look we're
gonna keep it really minimal under the
eyes so if you want you can dust some
like shimmer under there
I'm just loving this palette and I was
looking in here and I was like huh
oh my god there's a shade called
unpredictable that is like this peachy
literally like just metallic heaven now
sometimes I'll take metallic and I'll
put it under my entire eyes and then
I'll do mascara and it just makes it
look like Oh crazy so let me just put a
little bit in here and see how bright
that is gonna be oh well it's really
pretty I'm just I'm just going with the
flow I definitely want something a
little darker on the eyes for the rest
of the under eyes so I think I'm going
to fit back into the Kat Von D shade in
light one more time and I'm gonna go in
with this really light one over here I'm
just gonna go once once or twice and
we're just gonna put that right under my
eye there we go already
loving it it just gives it kind of an
added little something so it's not blank
now the mascara is what's gonna really
make this look look crazy and then we're
gonna do huge lashes for the waterline
I'm gonna do
stark bright white and this is gonna
really make the eye look really poppin
and like oh this is about the change of
the whole look so yeah just elevates the
ID and just makes it look like
woo-woo-woo hello today I'm going to be
trying the new NARS audacious mascara
this is in shade black moon
now I've never used this before look at
this Bristol it's like really like oh
hey now I've never tried it so let's
just see what happens here I am gonna
put on false lashes so I really don't
mind what happens but as long as it
coats these entirely black that's all
I'm worried about this is very subtle
I'm not really loving this mascara so
I'm gonna go back with my benefit roller
lash do to do to do the bottoms because
I love how this looked on the bottom so
we're just gonna go back and forth ever
so gently and just coat these bottoms I
just popped on some lashes these are by
oval lower lashes and this is their new
invisible and these are called a strip
down these are so big and bold I love
them okay now today we're actually going
to shock everybody and put some blush on
so I'm gonna be dipping into my NARS
orgasm blush I've been using this for I
don't know ten years I mean they've had
this for a long time and I keep going
back to it just because it's so pretty
and I know coral is back everyone loves
coral this is such a pretty color
I'm gonna use my little NARS kabuki
brush and we're just gonna add a little
a little glow to these cheeks now I love
this blush because it has a little like
kind of iridescent in it as well I'm
just like ooh give me a little color and
this brush because I've never tried this
I know they have a set Sephora where you
can get on NARS Calm it's so soft and it
just gives your blush a really even nice
little appearance I'm like mmm-hmm all
right now what is it time for it's time
to highlight alright today we're going
to take this a Mac Daddy diamond glow
powder this one is called Illuminati and
it is so blinding when I say blinding it
is beau lining and then we're going to
take a little more feet 310 brush this
is a little fan brush that makes these
powders apply like heaven alright so I'm
just gonna do a little oh oh I'm so
sorry my cheeks are like what in them
this is porn to me I'm like give me the

hello it looks like I just dipped my
face in metal which is my goal every
morning when I wake up all right other
side look how boring the side looks this
other side of my face is like oh I'm
asleep and then it's like oh hi I barely
even put much powder on here so it's
like a little bit goes such a long way
it's in sane
we are glowing like radiation now for
lips I'm not really sure what to do
today I have these new metallic liquid
lipsticks from Milani and I feel like I
should try them because I've never used
them before this looks are really
metallic and I'm like this is gonna be
weird well only one way to find out
chromatic addict number one okay well
let's give it a whirl
okay oh wow whoo that is extreme
metallic and I like it I think I need to
go back to the drugstore and get every
color I'm like wait a minute here okay I
normally never would wear a lip like
this but I'm really loving it so okay
these are amazing I'm gonna have to get
more colors and try them all out now the
light is reflecting really crazy in my
studio because at first I'm like wait
that looks like there's not that much
there and then when you move around
you're like okay it's like reflecting
crazy huh this is so bizarre this is
really this is the look that I normally
would never really do I'm trying to go
out of my comfort zone and on my move
this one is not like it's that different
that's just the way I mapped it out is
different the contour the metallic lip
it's wild so alright I am ready to
finish this off now we all know I just
did my talk to spray now just seal this
existence let's use a little makeup
forever mist and fix okay now I think
that this look would look amazing with
some blonde hair so I'm gonna go switch
and I'll be right back alright guys this
is the final look oh my god like I swear
to god these powders this is like a
blinding I love the shade I used one of
his other ones for my full face
highlighter challenge and I'm like these
are like amazing I know that Mac Daddy
is putting out more colors soon and I'm

think these liquid lipsticks are a
pretty dope I'm about to go eat a
cheeseburger and see what happens so now
