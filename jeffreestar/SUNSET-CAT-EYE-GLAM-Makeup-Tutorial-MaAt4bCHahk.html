I'm just gonna have a little chit chat
with you guys first of all hi I can't
believe the love that all of you guys
have been showing to my channel so thank
you so much for all the comments all the
thumbs-up and all the love it's
incredible and it just makes me more
excited to create you know just a
billion more videos for you guys so
thank you
number two I just have to take a quick
second to laugh about the people that
are telling me huh smoking weed is
horrible guys and makeup are
nasty I mean it's all your opinion but I
don't understand why you would even want
to watch because we're on YouTube where
there is a billion makeup artists so I'm
gonna keep smoking dope I'm gonna keep
using Gucci makeup and I'm gonna keep on
being myself all right now back to
makeup today I'm doing a little fun warm
toned sunset it's not smoky it's not a
wing it's like an in-between smoky wing
so saddle up get your brushes ready and
enjoy this look today I did my normal
face routine if you want to see how I
did the base in the brows you can look
through my channel and find that gym but
today we're gonna do a cat eye I'm gonna
start by priming my lids oh my god
Geoffrey farming the lids I know it
happens once in a while especially for
these extreme glamour looks and I'm
gonna go in with that YSL Couture eye
primer I love this one if you want to
use the Mac painterly that everyone else
uses um please use that I personally
can't buy mine so we all be using this
today and I'm just applying this with a
little Mac two one seven brush and I'm
just gonna coat my entire lids and I'm
gonna bring it up almost to the brow
bone
do I even have a brow bone if you don't
have a brow yeah I guess I do
my whole forehead is the brow bone it's
almost like mashing my skin down that's
crazy and then I'm gonna put some under
my eyes to adjust a little bit just a
little hair all right now today we're
gonna do something that I normally don't
do
we're gonna use some scotch tape for
that wing when you do a lot of eye
shadows and you want to get that extreme
cut look scotch tape is the easiest way
to go now I know a lot of you are going
to be like what you're gonna put that
over your foundation I definitely a.m.
I'm just going to put on really light
and soft so it doesn't really disrupt it
and if it rips it off we'll just apply
it more later so what you want to do is
just wear your tear ducts are you want
to follow your natural eye line and just
go up so I'm just gonna follow that
natural line and bam she scotched
probably the most common question is
well how do you get this side to match
it's honestly like drawing on the brows
you just gotta I ball it alright now
that the eyes are taped it's time to do
the eye shadow now I'm gonna use a new
palette today that I've never tried this
is the new violet Baz Holy Grail eyes
shadow palette now when I saw these
colors I was like whoo bitch this pala
is sickening I am loving these reds that
gold deal I think right away I am going
to dip into this color called hashtag
and I'm gonna be using my Mac two to
four brush this is gonna be like my
transition color and let's see how well
these shadows blend I'm just gonna go
right in my crease I'm actually not
gonna go all the way you guys know I
love to go all the way to my brow bone
to the nose today we're gonna stop that
because we're doing something different
sorry to dick in my throat and I'm just
gonna follow my natural brow bone all
right now I'm gonna take the brush and
go all the way to where that tape is and
then brush out now of course for most of
you that do not have a face tattoo you
can drag it out even more if you want
I'm just gonna go past the brow for like
a really dramatic effect all right now
normally I do a really light eyeshadow
at the top which I'm going to just do
now and I'm gonna take this shade called
thanks a lot a which is a really nice
cream nude color without shimmer and I'm
just going to take my Mac two by two
brush and just take it from the start of
the brow and buff it all the way across
this is really going to help me get that
amazing
softfinish and make sure it's all
blended now then I'm just going back
with that brush with no extra product
but I'm just softening that transition
color even more now let's add in some
darkness all right I'm going to take
this map to 1/7 brush and I'm gonna dip
into that wine color oh so pretty hi I'm
gonna create some really dramatic depth
so let me just take this brush and I'm
gonna actually put it on my lid but not
all the way just a little bit well
halfway there
notice how I'm not going all the way in
I'm just keeping it what what is this
like a 60% and then we're gonna drag
this as well and that's where that tape
really comes in handy because it's gonna
stop all that crazy fallout and it's
gonna create a beautiful line now how
are we gonna make this color blend
amazing we're gonna go back in with that
same blending brush from earlier I like
to go back and forth and back and forth
a lot so we're gonna get dip back into
hashtag and then we're just gonna blend
and blend before I add in any more
darkness I want to do a pop-up color in
here and I keep staring at this color
called toffee it's like this gold color
I'm like mesmerised by it so let me dip
in with my little Mac two one three
brush let's see here
whoo what she's a cheese thing Majid
alright so let me just do a little bit
in case it's really intense and we'll
just pop this right in here come through
gold and I'm gonna just take this down
right in the corner okay this gold I'm
like I can't stop staring at it so
pretty
we got the gold going into the cranberry
into the transition I definitely want to
do a little bit of kind of darkness not
necessarily liner but I want that crazy
liner effect so I'm gonna be dipping
into teddy bear yes and we're using more
feet I'd one for brush I'm just gonna
take this and go really low almost yeah
where my lash line is and kind of go a
little tiny bit in the crease with that
dark color just so I have some like
we'll depth to this look so I'm not
taking it in there it's just really
subtle settle settle settle there's
nothing subtle about this look but um
this is a subtle part but let me peel
this tape off and see what's under this
mess my whole skin like peels off Oh
Lord guide me through this misery BAM
mmm now is this side gonna be even
though oh my god I'm scared
BAM she is punchy okay now that the tape
is off I see everybody always taking
black liquid or a black liner and doing
it across the lid and up I want to be
different and not do that because the
shadows are so pretty it's like a
beautiful like sunset I'm like zoom
these shadows together are perfect so
let's just focus on the bottom now I'm
just going to take my black Mac smolder
eye pencil and we're just going to tight
line that waterline really thinly all
right now for under the eyes I'm gonna
take this color called so jelly it's
like how do you explain this color it's
so pretty it's like a peachy soft coral
II I don't know what it like I don't
have to explain it it's just fierce so
I'm taking my Tom Ford 14 pencil brush
and I'm just gonna pop some of this down
below that liner oh yes when your upper
eye shadow is so intense you don't
really need to like do crazy crazy under
here we're just gonna blend this into
the gold okay now I brought this almost
to like the middle of my iris so now I'm
going to be taking this color called
cranberry splash right here with the
same brush I'm just gonna dip into there
really lightly now I'm gonna take that
and drag it under and normally you guys
know I love to drag my liner on the
bottom out we're actually gonna keep it
tight today and notice how that black
liner on top I've sort of mixed it now
that we've gotten towards the end of the
eyeball and I'm taking the black and I'm
just kind of dragging it down almost
like little downward motions just so it
creates a really nice smokey
fact I want to keep that darkness
towards the end of my eye and now I'm
just going back and forth and back and
forth if an eye shadow is extreme with
the pigment and you want to just test it
out I'll dab it into the pan and then
I'll really lightly go over it until I
really know how tense if I'd it can get
then I'll go over it more harder meaning
my pressure so the first time I was
barely dragging it across now I'm like
really pushing it into my eye so I can
get that cranberry effect oh this is
gorgeous
now usually I smoke it out really heavy
and bring it down I'm going to keep it a
little more light today and I'm going to
be dipping in to that so jelly color one
more time with a little small morphe
brush and I'm just going to go over it
one more time there we go we're just
going to merge these two together so
they're like becoming best friends again
and then I'm going to dip in a cranberry
splash one more time with the same brush
and then just kind of blend them
together alright I am obsessed with this
eye look but it wouldn't be complete
without some amazing lashes so let's put
them on and now I'm gonna coat my lashes
with the Too Faced better than sex
mascara before I put on them lashes
bottom esker is so essential for this
look like bringing it all together for
lashes today I'm gonna be using the
violet Baz faux mink style lashes these
are brand new and the style is called
just layin I love these because they
don't like cover your eyeshadow and go
like all the way up to your brow which I
like doing that every day but I want my
eyeshadow to have the center stage so
let's put these in well zone you
know what's cool about these lashes is
that when I put the band on my eyelid it
like really formed to it easy it wasn't
like I had to pull and tug it around for
like an hour just fit nice mm-hmm
I am loving these lashes what do you
guys think
okay the eyes are officially done I
think it's time for some highlight and
some lips
I'm actually gonna use some blush today
ah I'm going to use this NARS beautiful
little kabuki brush so soft and I'm
gonna be using the NARS blush in shade
deep throat
now this one has little fine Mike as a
glitter in it hmm I love to put blush
just on the apples of my cheeks I hate
when people take it and they go all the
way to the hairline and you just mask
that beautiful contour that you already
did earlier so we're just gonna add in
just a little bit of color I'm feeling
feisty today
alright today I'm going to actually
shock you all and do a really soft
highlight these new hourglass
highlighters are so pretty this is that
your doesn't strobe light let's see how
they look they're really pretty have a
little faint shimmer in it well faint
shimmers and I'm just gonna apply this
right above that blush since the eyes
are so extreme I don't want to really
glow too much but I guess that's the
effect I wanted if you want to do a
crazier glow please you know I'm all
about that but today I'm gonna let my
eyes just have a moment because they're
feeling a little neglected now I'm gonna
take this and just do a little here look
keep it's about a moment go down that
nose a little bit and then go back one
more time with the cheek for lips today
I'm going to create a little kind of
ombre liquid lip effect with two Kat Von
D liquid lip shades noble and lovesick
I'm going to be taking this shade on the
outsides suck in that's the Lima girl
and we're gonna leave the middle a
little blank alright now that those are
connected I'm gonna take no Bowl and put
her right in the center mm-hm oh yes and
then I'm gonna take my finger actually
in just fine in oh I love these two
together so pretty without the center
I'm just adding a little more and
blending it I'm gonna go back in with
lovesick one more time and just darken
it a little on the outsides using a
different clean finger and voila
the lips are done alright now I sadly
run out of my Urban Decay setting spray
so I'm gonna go right to Sephora and buy
like 20 of them so I'm gonna use my
makeup forever mist and fix which was in
my purse
and we're just gonna do this whole face
mmm oh Lord
all right guys this look is complete
alright guys this is the completed look
I am obsessed with it it was fun to do
something that was a little different
and you know out of my comfort zone the
scotch tape thing I was like how is this
gonna turn out but I'm obsessed with it
I think it's really easy to do really
fun and it was actually way quicker than
I thought so I hope you guys enjoyed and
as always leave me some feedback below
and I will see you guys in the next one
