because the velor at liquid lipstick was
my first product that I ever put out
I'll never forget November of 2014 I put
out my first three shades it was red rum
I'm royalty and prom night
the rest is history and it's just crazy
how we are now three and a half years in
and my liquid lip is such a staple for
so many of you guys though before we
even still watch anything thanks to you
guys for making this formula such a hit
and I'm so thankful for all of you out
there that just loved it so of course
it's time to expand now I know I do a
lot of limited edition collections
I put out a lot of colors and a lot of
you guys were like okay honey you put
stuff in limits a dish like edition
packaging but then it goes away and we
really like we run out a lot of people
email all the time like where is this
this this so I'm like okay let's do a
shade extension for the spring let's
bring back some favorites and let's
introduce some new shades so alright so
we have four new shades I'm just gonna
hold up the boxes right here you may be
familiar with the names because they are
from my summer chrome collection from
last year and they were in live
ammunition which of course is my stick
satin lipstick formula so today we bring
you the new liquid lip version of
thickest thieves skin-tight birthday
suit and allegedly now these were huge
last summer they they all sold out and I
was like oh okay and a lot of you
emailed I'm like we really want liquid
version so if you guys remember in my
velour mini bundle that came out last
year I put skin-tight into mini but now
it's gonna be full size so we have these
ones of course and just a quick reminder
in case you have never warned my
lipsticks before my liquid lips retail
for $18 they are vegan they are cruelty
free and they are long lasting without
feeling really crunchy the formula is a
very smooth like butter but it doesn't
look too crazy they're really not
streaky at all some shades y'all know
we're really hard to make like that
yellow cool when you guys get these of
course they will be in the pink box now
with the pink cap not in the limited
edition so they are now permanent and
they will be here forever I think we
should swatch the first four shades that
are brand-new on my mouth and of course
I'm gonna do a lot of hands washes and
compared swashes swatches bitch it's
been it's been a minute so of course by
the time you guys are watching this all
the lipsticks are live on my website but
let's get just watching and of course if
you want a shop I will link everything
down below for you guys so before we
swatch the four new shades I'm also
gonna do hand swatches of all the nudes
because
if you want to see comparisons but let's
talk about the shades that I'm bringing
back permanently from previous
collections so quickly we have the two
metallics candy ass and poinsettias and
now these shades were huge hits last
year and we got so many emails and
feedback like girl we need candy ass we
need it also they are back honey now I
am bringing back a older will say
vintage where I'm kidding it was only
two years old this is from these summer
2015 collection and the shade is
cultivar Jenna t it is a beautiful lilac
really soft lavender now of course we
have two more we have the iconic
Calabasas now this one Wow I have never
sold as many lipsticks in a
limited-edition collection then I did
with this shade and it was such a big
hit of course I live in Calabasas it's
my City we had to bring it back shout
out to you guys because you came hard
for this shade so I'm really excited for
this to be back and last but not least
oh my god I have never gotten this many
comments emails and tweets about this
nude so we are bringing back Christmas
cookie of course I had to so I think you
guys it's time to get to swatching also
if you're watching this I have a lot of
lip scrubs that are back in stock we
have orange soda blue raspberry sucker
and there's a lot of scrubs that you
guys have been living and breathing and
dying for they're actually restocked as
well so I'm gonna take out my orange
soda because girl you know these lips
need some scrubbing no if you have never
tried one of my lip scrubs before they
retail for $12 they are vegan of course
they're cruelty free they are edible you
don't want to substitute them for a meal
which some people have but they are
edible there's aloe vera in here and
vitamin E and they leave your lips
feeling
and of course if you're feeling hungry
take a scoop for yourself so let's start
with skin-tight it is one of my lightest
nudes now I have a lot of nudes in my
collection and here are some from the
permanent collection that we will
compare with later but this is a very
peachy nude a lot of people like to
compare it to I'm nude a lot of nudes in
this video and it looks like this
compared next to it of course everything
looks different in a bottle and next to
pink so I will put it on my hands and
stuff for you but you can see that skin
tight over here is very nude it is very
very nude
all right here is skin tight so watched
like I know it's my own brand so I
really can't pick this is my favorite
color
but I really love this nude really good
for just like neutrals and smokey eyes
and it's just like I feel very no I just
wanna say disclaimer that I do put a
little bit of foundation on my lips
because when you wipe away you do got to
cover it up so there's no makeup remover
residue on your mouth so that's why I
look like that here what are you doing
girl get back there so the next shade
that I'm gonna swatch is allegedly now
this is a terracotta warm tone nude it
can be confused with thick as thieves
but thick as thieves is a lot more cool
toned I'm gonna swatch them all my hands
and show you guys all a comparison and a
little bit but I love this shade it is
so warm I love wearing like lashes and a
little glitter and nothing else but this
maybe some perfume and a thong
I don't want this shit in a few months
and bitch I live for the shade all right
this is allegedly so watched now we're
gonna swatch thickest thieves it is a
very beautiful brown has a little bit of
different like undertone in there that
you may be not used to but I love it is
also kind of a warm toned shade it just
looks
all right y'all all right let's throw
his hair back for a second all right
this is thick as thieves so watch what
y'all think
and the fourth brand-new shade is
birthday suit now this one was such a
hit in the lip ammo formula I had to do
it in the liquid now it is in between
let's see let's do a little comparison
there's a lot of nudes here but it's
it's in the family of let's see if we
can hold all of these up here it sits in
the family in between here so it's in
between skin tight and I'm nude but just
a little lighter than mannequins so if
mannequin is too dark for you birthday
suit is gonna be right up your alley or
I love taking liquid lips that are
darker like thick as thieves and then
putting like birthday suit in the middle
for that little ombre Pamela Anderson 90
small
here is birthday suits so watched now
let me know down below what your
favorite shade from these four nudes are
but I am gonna swatch the other colors
that will be brought back permanently in
case you've never seen them or you're
like girl I need a reminder my hand is
about to be covered in colors and we're
gonna compare all the nudes as well
because I know we're gonna get a lot of
let me see mannequin next to do today so
besides those four of course we are
bringing back at Calabasas one of my
favorite shades that I've ever created
and we're just gonna do a little high
BAM right there
there is Calabasas and as i swatched
these they are gonna dry down of course
they're all matte whether they are matte
or metallic they do all dried down now
let's do Christmas cookie
BAM and there she is of course we gotta
do pumpkin pie no this one was so highly
requested like girl come on Christmas I
see y'all and there she is now the thing
about this one there's actually little
reflux of glitter in the formula so once
it dries completely down you can take
your finger and just kind of rub it a
little bit and it kind of activates the
glitter and glitter does come forward
and it looks very sparkly and pretty and
now we're gonna do the red metallic
shade of points Adia I love this one
especially mixing it with like I'm Matt
it's a wrap
BAM very high in shine and it's
definitely a way more metallic of course
than the other ones and once it dries
down it has a beautiful red shift to it
alright next up we have candy ass which
is the other metallic shade now this one
came out last summer now this one is a
really fun it definitely has a more
moose II like texture and so does Points
area as you can see as I'm putting it
like on my hand on the lips it is very
like it is like butter little less
watery than the normal mattes and the
last shade from the collection is
virginity now it is a very muted lilac
shade so now this shade is very pale I
call it like a purple nude and I adore
this color so I'm gonna swatch all the
nude shades now and of course if you
don't hear me say something just to
replay it
so the first shade I'm going to swatch
is I'm new
now I'm just gonna start putting them
down here because we have a lot of nudes
you know I'm gonna put skin tight next
to I'm nude and let's see what it looks
like definitely a huge difference but
it's hard to tell until you really see
them together so there is skin tight and
now here is birthday suit
here is celebrity skin a lot darker
literally my top-selling lipstick of all
time so for everyone that has ever
bought in a celebrity skin it thank you
so much as you can see that is a lot
darker how come when we swatch things we
let go down and more it's like getting
longer as we go I think a good one to
swatch next to this one is Christmas
cookie because I get asked that all the
time even though it's up here I am gonna
put it down next to the other ones just
so you can visually see it so there is
Christmas cookie as you can see there's
a lot more peachy undertone to it and
definitely very different next to that I
am gonna do mannequin this is this one
look at this this is all the one bitch
I've had this forever I've worn
mannequin for so long I think it's my
favorite nude that I've ever created
personally and there it is swatched now
let's do a very dark one this is more
like a sack of Grey's with the nude
undertone
this is posh spice one of my all-time
favorites a lot more muted and dark and
now we're gonna swatch Nathan because a
lot of people want to know the tea on
the shade this is a lot more warm tone
than people think so when you put it
next to other nudes you're like oh so
there is Nathan swatched
and I'm gonna do a few more because I
think that allegedly is definitely
darker but it's still kind of closed in
that family so I'm gonna put that one
next to it
BAM as you can see that one is a lot
darker than Nathan
and then lastly let's put thickest
thieves on here now of course you guys
know I have a lot of other nudes
we have androgyny we have dominatrix we
have a lot more on my website but these
are similar in tone so I thought why not
put at least these next to each other so
there's thick as thieves wow these are
all swatch of course they are starting
to all dry down look at candy-ass it is
so these are all the swatches now
remember of course these are now all out
into the world and I am so excited for
you guys to finally get to play with all
of them also I am restocking a lot of
sold-out shades on my website so like
I'm nude celebrity skin and there's a
bunch of stuff of course you can check
my social medias for all of the shades
