to my channel today I brought Nathan
here hi baby hi baby what are we going
to do today we're going to try some face
masks some weird as fuck face mask yeah
I would say so
now Nathan's skin you guys has improved
tremendously since we've met and I know
a lot of you have shared your thoughts
on that you're like what's his secret we
want to remind you that me and Nathan we
are regular human beings well I don't
know if I am and I'm like an alien
cyborg happens whenever you shave your
face so Nate just one baby face yeah
every time I shave you always unveil
whatever's underneath alike a little
scruff so it usually gets a little
sweaty and stays there and then it yeah
so he does get breakout he is a normal
dude so right now he does have a little
breakout you know no kind of little
crazy
pimple appear it's finally going away
y'all know about about that skin I'm not
I'm not perfect either I've had my
moments but I'll get that little
constellation going on alright so today
we're going to try out two types of
masks one has been going viral for a
year all over YouTube everywhere their
mother has reviewed it except us so
what's up so what are we going to try
out today we're gonna try out this
carbonated bubble claim mask yes now I
know this was really big a few months
ago and now viral on Facebook again
we're gonna talk about that one in a
minute we have to google the
instructions because it's all in other
language yes definitely not English and
today I am going to be trying a brand
new mask from Tasha you guys of course
are familiar with Tantra because I had a
dowsed of my entire face over and over
and over with their luminous dewy skin
mist I am such a fan of this setting
spray skin refresher it's very nice it's
amazing a little pricey this brand is
very pricey but it is amazing and it
works and that's what I like but does
this mask work we had no idea we do not
so I am going to be trying out the
violent sea radiance mask look at this
jar not that's a cool color it's
stunning and it came in this beautiful
box the ombre that looks like this it's
like very all like satin and cute I love
it I always have cool packaging move
Johanna now this one oh my lord so we're
going to talk about both obviously
they're very different from different
brands and how much is here is baby this
one is $12 now this one is a hefty
$68 you know Tasha they're bougie and I
fuckin lead for it so we'll see if mrs.
worth the price most of the time their
stuff works - it really does this one
says that we have to leave it on for
like 15 to 20 minutes Nate is only five
minutes you'll lift this put on mine
first
yeah and let's see what happens then
when mines on we can do yours okay so
mine is a creamy anti-aging mask pack
with brightening Japanese beauty berry
and dual vitamin C to reveal a brighter
softer skin so two types of vitamin C
will provide an instant glow and an
antioxidant protection from UV damage
for a continued writer skin over time
I'm down for that because Sun I don't
like you so this mask is for all skin
types which is pretty cool I love that
so it says after cleansing apply a
generous even layer to the skin avoiding
the eye area leave on for 15 to 20
minutes and then rinse with warm water
all right it also came with this really
cute talk show it's called the essence
this is like a little travel size
normally it comes in a big bottle and it
says use first before the mask for a
better result so I'm just going to take
a little cotton circle from CVS you
already know and let's put this all over
so I will just wipe around my face to
get all the dirt off look how much I
wear a lot of makeup last night so it's
like and Nate has already prepped his
skin with this Sicily rose toner alright
so let's open this up and see what it
looks like oh wow look at the color it's
such a cool thing yeah it's like so cool
it's like a literally like a violet
lavender and oh my god so so good yummy
I'm like hmm okay so you're literally
just supposed to take it with your hands
of course look at these nails y'all I'm
not trying to get these nails fucked up
and oh let's just see what happened so
it says apply a thick even layer - no
it's so cool I'm kind of like in love
with this color
all right you guys the mask is on my
skin and now it smells amazing it feels
I don't wanna say cooling because it
doesn't like the freezer face or
anything but it definitely has like a
little cool to the touch it feels really
nice on the skin I love the color it's
fucking cool oh my god my hair this
color right okay let me wipe my hands
off now Nate let's open up yours baby
Ryan baby now I'm going to Google this
you guys because literally if you see on
the box the ingredients the instructions
everything is in a different language
but if this is from the brand Becca
milky Pig this is like the same brand
that we did the magnetic face mask oh
really
for $12 you do get a lot of product yeah
you doesn't do I can't even see the
ounces on here you guys because it's in
another language so let me google it and
I also wanted to note on the talk-show
one you guys you do get a lot of product
obviously you guys see I use a lot on my
face and there's still a whole lot in
there there's a huge tub there so it
didn't use a lot of products alright
baby so this is going to let's see here
what is it supposed to do blackhead
removal suitable for all skin types of
collagen green tea charcoal clay mask
okay so basically this is supposed to
take out all your in purity so you're
just going to take a lot with the
spatula alright so it says to put a
hefty amount on your whole entire face
leave on for three to five minutes and
when the bubbles have blown up
absolutely do a foam massage with a
little tippet water and wash away all
right so let's have you start coating
your face alright so I'm just going to
help him out oh my god ready kind of
like bubbling in here from being out in
the open holy shit so basically the
warning on the box said do not eat okay
it's good to know uh-huh spatula you
guys is really little I don't like it I
wish it would have distributed the
product like a larger amount but whoa I
can hear it like sizzling almost like
soda pop like I might to a different
face brush you guys because this is
taking so long hold that
alright so I'm going to take this brush
I would put my primer on with and
hopefully that will distribute it a lot
quicker there we go
yeah the brush it comes with you guys
with that little spatula thing is
shitty we got it the Grilli bubble yeah
I know it's like almost like tickling my
face from bubbling really yeah I like
want to itch it a little bit no new me
it's like you try to put more on them
the bubbles are like getting crazy I'm
going to avoid the eye area of course as
always it's hard when it starts foaming
you guys to get it to like adhere to the
skin oh my god oh my god you're bubbling
like an old little man
okay so we're but we're about two
minutes in and it looks like a cloud sat
on Nate's face yeah it's hard to move
your face no I mean I can't really
breathe through my nose or I'll like
start to suck it into my nose really
mine feels really good it's like very
normal obviously yours is bubbling like
crazy market starting to like fall off
my face no it's not I know I got a heavy
like big no no it feels like it's
starting to like drizzle almost oh no
it's not oh my god it's like the foam on
top of a soda like would you touch it
that is so weird
I could just see it in my peripherals
and everything I call my Saint coming
out yeah yeah it's like falling down
your mouth my baby don't gotta melt
anymore look at my little Keebler my
little Keebler Elf like keyboarder I
look like a little goblin err yeah let's
look if you have like hair but then it's
like everywhere I feel like I'm some
shit off the Lord of the Rings or
something mm-hmm one of those orc
look at the nose it's like ah that's
like some witch status right there don't
eat yeah oh yeah it's not edible I'm
sorry okay so it said that when it's
fully foamed like it is right now just
take a little bit of water and like kind
of massage it into your skin we do not
have a sink handy you guys so we're
gonna have to pause I have like 10 more
minutes for my math but you want to go
over inches off in a second yeah let me
go try it yeah let's try it tiny bit you
guys they'll be with water but is that
necessary
yeah for reviewing it it's necessary
okay we just splash some water on my
hand pouring water in his hands right
now how's that great oh whoa whoa it's a
pasty clay huh yeah definitely is still
so I should probably go rinse this off
these poor starts falling over
all right we'll be right back all right
baby you are clean you're looking like
shiny how does it feel it feels really
nice it feels like my skin is almost a
little tighter oh really
like a little bit yeah like it firm like
like a firming mask your skin looks good
is it kind of healthy keep going uh I
know because I'll really say I can feel
the tightness of it a little bit I mean
must be here we'll put some of this
Kendall is getting nice on ya work your
video mixer is happen like this skin is
really hell are you okay yeah the
natural highlighter all right I'm gonna
go wipe this off you guys I'll be right
back
oh right I just washed off the mask it
was a little difficult and I don't mind
a negative way it was just like a really
thick and pasty so I had to get the
washcloth up in there but first
impressions like how do I look it any
different am i right or no no I mean I
mean for having me to like rub it off
kind of hard you don't look that red to
be honest it feels really like supple
saw okay yeah it does I really like it
I'm like oh my god hi
now obviously I like to wear masks a lot
and I'm definitely gonna be testing this
out more but first off you guys I think
that it feels nice my skin feels like
mmm it feels nice it was full like it's
a little tight on the forehead area not
to like and I don't want in a bad way I
love that feeling of like a tight mask
you feel like I actually did something
all right so overall do I think that
this mask is worth $68 you guys know I'm
bushi as fuck so I'm not going to say
it's not worth it because I personally
really liked it of course this is my
first time using it I think if you want
to see how something works over time if
it shows real benefits to your skin you
do got to use something for about you
know I think one to two months
honestly now this mask says that you can
use it two to three times a week so I
definitely will be trying it out I will
let you know in a later video maybe a
favorite maybe a disappointment
no but but um right off the bat I really
do like it now of course this is a
little heavy on the price so if you are
not a skincare junkie you might want to
do without it but what about your baby
was it worth $12 I would say it's
probably worth $12 I mean if you're
you're down with your face being tickled
a little bit in one to $12 I am I'm all
I'm down to I'll be your French tickler
thank you for watching the video I
enjoyed trying this a bubble mask oh it
was a cute baby it was really cool
though cloud-based I really like my the
more I'm sitting here I'm like oh my god
