don't know what to do you guys kind of
called dr. dart right now
look at my face know what my last night
never a dull moment on this channel Oh
in the nose it feels weird okay I hate
the spatula just for the record yeah

that's the nice and cold it's hot there
was 90 today you guys it was a yeah it
was not everywhere at all
the dogs do not like that weather except
diva David loves the fuck he loves the
heat our king he's nine years old love's
basking in the Sun huh so I cut myself
earlier let's talk about the elephant in
the room I have a little freckle here I
know most of you know that grazed the
razor blade of mouth shaving off my
eyebrows and ashy gum bleeding for 30
minutes
so what let's put a mask over it let's
say a prayer because she's gone oh boy
so how's that face mask feeling weird
yeah like like I'm gonna itch in my nose
you got oh oh yeah in my nostrils look
oh boy got it kind of like it's not the
mask itself isn't oh it's kind of itchy
almost Reza I feel like mine starting to
feel like almost a little tingly more
tight yeah yeah it's cold it has so much
glitter in it I know I was thinking
raizy
like Sparkle and everywhere look at when
I laugh it's like I know it's like
drooping down I don't know if there was
enough product in here that was very
weird
yeah I don't know I mean I may have
botched it it's okay we'll see if it
dries it's yeah it feels weird I don't
like it I couldn't imagine it looks
weird alright you guys I guess we're
gonna go eat some pizza Hut and we will
be back in 20 see you then
tell me what happened
my drink back I needed this spit but oh
and you spit I did i swallow okay yeah
Skincare's the class of the fucking
month honey oh hi um okay I'm so over
this up being on my yeah mine's like
yours already hanging Hannibal it's
flapping around this looks wet yeah it
does look what it but it's actually not
it's a literal rubber I'm freaking out
so I definitely did not apply enough of
this I'm so sorry but let's peel chill
porn weird oh girl look oh wow yeah I
did not a little residue come on leave
behind this pink is Sony are we feeling
about me look I feel so hot I don't know
if this is right long enough it said 15
to 20 and it's been 25 I've definitely
been 20 and I still got some residue oh
oh I think I just applied a pretty thick
on this side to be honest girl mmhmm
yeah as usual on my face yeah I don't
know how I feel about this
your face is all wow you can see the
white touch let me see Jesus I mean
that's just I know everyone knows
exactly my skin always gets red yeah
mine's like a warrior at this point it's
like bring it on okay we're gonna go get
all of this mess off of our face Oh
we'll be right back all right
first impressions you're red I'm right
as fuck it always happens yeah you know
it
I got sensitive skin with any peel-off
mask does that to me so let's give me a
little bit of hydration this is the
hydro beauty essence mist from Chanel
found us in Italy all right and maybe it
will help calm you skin I mean usually
after like 30 minutes his redness goes
away but is there can you smells great
I'm just like oh okay so first
impressions on mine how's it feeling it
was supposed to be like really hydrating
pray and I know I probably didn't mix it
well but like no tea no shade
don't really notice that much of a
difference right it's not like you're
dry or hydrated it just comes like here
you know just there I'm a little read
here but overall I'm not like feeling
really yeah maybe on a cheek a little
here but no it's not bad
I'm just being like just feel it it
doesn't feel like that hydrated to me
and it feels kind of like basic ass
bitch alright so long story short yours
you've tried it before you live you
lived in life yeah yeah it's cool yeah I
don't mind mine I don't know I mean I
love doctor dirt moisturizer actually
but the mask didn't like WoW me yeah
maybe is because it was just really hard
to figure out there's still really red
yeah if you you know how do you know if
you actually start correctly exactly oh
oh my god this shimmer over the redness
is diamond all right you guys we're
about to go dab awesome oh so good I'm
hungry I know so a lot of people on my
review is said that I should have put
the body lava on and then set it I'm
like you cannot put sticky products on
this or it's gonna get ruined I used to
do it it looks nice so maybe we'll try
it but you know what I got a lot of
feedback on people want me to cut this
open and see what's inside
