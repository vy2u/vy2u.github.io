been tagging it because you guys are
always sneaky and you know what is up

course the bundle comes in this
beautiful box they are not sold separate
I know a lot of people are asking they
only come in the discounted bundle so
this will retail for $52 and of course
they will be on my website as well as
Beauty Lycia Beauty Bay if you're in the
UK and a lot of
retailers will be carrying this so
September 30th at 10 a.m. Pacific
Standard Time that's 1 p.m. Eastern
Standard Time this baby will be out and
I can't wait now I know a lot of people
were asking about the fill wait on these
and everything about it I'm gonna be
doing a separate video in the future so
let me stop running my damn mouth and
let's jump into this actual so watch
video so if you want to see me swatch a
bunch of crazy-ass expensive liquid lips
they keep on watching so I haven't
filmed in a minute and I have so much
makeup in front of me my head is
spinning right now so I thought okay I
am such a liquid lip whore I want to sit
down and grab all the new liquid lips
that I found in Sephora and online that
are kind of pricey they're in that
luxury tier price of like okay a little
expensive is it worth it is it not so
there are four formulas here today that
I'm gonna be trying four different
brands I have never tried before of
course I've tried the brands but not the
formula of this particular product so I
think we should just jump right into it
now the first brand that we're gonna
test out today is from YSL Beauty they
recently just dropped these brand new
liquid lips they're calling them I'm
gonna botch this you guys know I do not
know how to speak French tad to wash how
would you say that
wash look at see that's what friends are
for these are the touch wash couture
matte stains from YSL the component
looks something like this here is one of
the shades so you get the gold chrome at
the top the frosted kind of glass moment
here and let's give us all the tea here
to me these look a little small but they
remind me of the Chanel ones and a bunch
of other brands so the fill wait for
this is zero point twenty ounces which
is actually not that bad so I have heard
that the applicator for this is weird
and I like weird products so this baby
will retail for $36 there are a bunch of
shades I'm talking like oh my god I'm
looking on the website girl there's like
20 damn shades let's open her up and
just see what it looks like whoa look at
that
I'm gonna hold up my hands you can
actually see that it is definitely like
cut very thin look how thin that is Oh
Lord that is a very unique doe foot I'm
like hmm okay I'm just gonna go on the
lip really weird I'm just gonna go in
right now and try this this shade is
called rose ink okay cute now before I
put it on let me see what this is
supposed to do is it supposed to be
long-lasting is it supposed to stain
what the hell is going on so on the
website it says a lightweight lip stain
with a revolutionary formula for ultra
matte high-impact color and a
lightweight naked lip feel okay so this
formula is gonna give us a matte tattoo
light color that is non drying okay high
pigment stays fresh and it's supposed to
be an eight hour wear hmm that's a big
claim and the exclusive liner like
applicator allows for a precision to
outline and fill in the lip okay it is
supposed to not only not feather it is
not supposed to spill over the lip line
girl let's get just watching okay this
has the typical YSL like Rose smell if
you've ever used their brand before I
think all their stuff smells like that
not bad let's see what happens
now the pigment is a little more sheer
than what I'm used to but then as its
drying it is full coverage like we can't
say it's not okay and that was only one
dunk and you know this bitch has a big
mouth so a little goes a long way
okay I'm a little surprised at how well
this applicator worked and at first I
was like okay is it kind of sheer but as
the formulas drying down it's been like
60 seconds literally it like looks nice
now I do want to give it another minute
to dry because it's still a little shiny
in there as you guys can see so let's
give us a minute and we'll be alright
you guys so it's been a few minutes and
the liquid lip still has a tiny little
shine tool which I'm not mad at but in
the Box obviously it says matte stain
usually I'm not a fan of that type of
formula but this one is nice Oh Mike and
it did a little bit on my fingers not
really that much just like tiny bit of
staining I have a fan of this formula so
far I think it definitely is really
comfortable they said it was lightweight
girl it's lightweight I love the wand on
this the DOE foot excuse me
I love the doe foot is very weird and
unique I kind of live for it now there
are other colors like I said today we're
only gonna be trying out one color per
formula but I do want to swatch a few
who this one's pretty
I just want to swatch a few to see what
they look like if they are consistent
you guys know tattoos I mean let's try
it oh if that can cover a tattoo you
know it has pigment so that is really
pretty
alright let's watch one more this one is
a number in Devon
oh it's like a pretty soft nude let's
see what she looks like ooh bitch oh wow
okay that looks a little more stringy
than the other one a little meaning a
lot maybe because it's a nude and it's
supposed to like have your real look
colors show through let me go over one
more time
so there may be a hit or miss with the
formula a lot of times brands don't stay
consistent when they have a bunch of
colors sometimes the nudes are better
sometimes the weird colors like the
greens are streaky so as you see there
is a little bit of weirdness with this
one now I'm curious I gotta try another
one okay let's open up one more rosewood
game and this one looks like this way
better pigment why is the nude one
streaky I don't know you guys but this
one is actually really pretty okay we're
gonna have to you turret a tutorial okay
so as you see here's what's going on
let's move on you guys look at how dark
my lips look that lipstick
stain may I'm not mad at you guys I mean
this is what happens anywhere makeup at
this
alright now let's try the new Smashbox
always on metallic mattes they come in a
little box like this and they're
actually looking very similar to YSL
which we all know Smashbox came out
first but look here's Smashbox
there's YSL same height same shape kind
of same measurements look let's put them
together Smashbox is baby really bigger
and Smashbox is gonna claim that they
have a fill weight of 0.13 ounces this
one says 20 oh my god now look from
making makeup myself I do know that when
you metallus eyes something where you
add this metallic formula to it there is
less product for some reason I don't
know why it's just how science works in
chemistry so these will retail for $24
which is not bad why so's was a little
up there Smashbox a little more flare in
the price point so this brand is cruelty
free this has a bunch of shades for this
well i grabbed a bunch now the ones that
have been like singing to my heart are
these Reds right here we are getting
into the fall holiday season this one
right here is called maneater and then
this one
veno Noir I saw my girl Laura Lee wear
this and I was like I'm owning that
color so I might even do a little I'll
bring her this today let's see here oh
yeah Smashbox has a really nice dope
foot it's nice and long it's thin
adheres to the lips very nicely and
here's what that looks like and I might
outline my lips in this and put that
other metallic
in the center let's see what happened
this formula is of course long-lasting
and it's supposed to stay on as well
it's called always on for a reason let's
see how she looks so I'm gonna leave the
center in there and just outline my lips
real quickly
now we're gonna take man-eater and put
it in the middle and do a little ombre
moment oh look at that red girl mmm
now I like to take a clean eyeshadow
brush or even my finger and I will just
go in and just kind of blend out the
edges and it makes your lips look very
airbrushed and three-dimensional so the
formula is dry it also feels really
lightweight like the previous one I
really love this color combo I'm like
dying for the metallic I just lived for
the finish it feels nice it dried quick
nothing's on my finger so it is a very
long-lasting it feels great damn
Smashbox you better work alright
so it comes in a little box like this
and when you open this bad boy up
it comes in the component that looks
like this I love the fade I love how
girl on packaging looks it's very cut
and pretty looks very royal now this is
gonna retail for $32 it is up there and
this is supposed to be a creamy velvet
lip color with intense pigments and lip
friendly ingredients creamy like a gloss
and pigmented like a lipstick with a
stunning matte finish okay so it's
probably gonna dry matte it's easy to
apply and it has a highly pigmented
long-lasting plumped look I'm down for
that baby this formula in coorporate
hyaluronic acid and tiger grass to
moisturize and smooth for comfortable
wear this brand only launched seven
colours girl I was expecting like 20
come on but there's a bunch of colors so
we have nudes we have red I just got all
seven you guys so I'm like you know
let's see what what I'm in the mood for
we can do this red one let's try it
I've had so much red on my mouth though
I'm scared let's do it nude you guys
let's do a nude this one is called
charming beige
and it looks like this so this has a
fill weight of 0.23 fluid ounces now
when you open it up it looks like this
okay so another kind of flat dough foot
it is a little on the smaller side which
I don't mind it all love it it looks at
velvety Oh smells very fresh almost
looks like like skin care honestly here
we go
here is the color swatch now this
formula is a very creamy very pigmented
right away it felt good it was probably
the easiest one to apply I don't know
why the formula just kind of like glided
on my mouth and bam here we are a few
seconds later it's moisturizing it feels
really good it's still another
lightweight formula I can't believe we
are testing all these brands and three
of them so far out of four have been
very like hydrating and lightweight I
feel like I've said that word so many
times but it just doesn't feel like
there's really much on my lips love the
color it feels really good another
a-plus I'm a little shook now we're
gonna try our fourth and final brand oh
god help me
alright so this one is from the brand
Charlotte Tilbury which has had a lot of
hits and a lot of misses on this channel
this is her formula for a liquid lip and
this is the Hollywood lips what is this
supposed to do first of all the fill
weight is 0.24 ounces which is pretty
good I like the component the rose gold
is cute her logo with the design you got
the little window so you can see the
color of course the illusion of filler
oh wow this is gonna give you wider lips
in one easy application it says it will
appear that your lips will be looked at
through a hyper-real filter the Crescent
applicator is designed to mimic the
natural curve of your mouth okay we have
we have just pull that out look and as
anti-aging sea lavender as it's active
ingredient with a combined affirming and
plumping action that makes it a great
natural solution for slowing down the
sides of aging sign me up
it also has a long wear finish with
beeswax to prevent it from being dry so
you have moisture that is supposed to
leave your lips baby soft that's a lot
of claims let's get to swashing people
so we're gonna open this bad bitch up
and oh it is curved okay let me hold up
my hand so you guys can really see so
there is the curve and you see the full
turn okay I mean my mouth so pink let's
just try on this color scream siren
let's give her a whirl
here is the color swatch so here's the
thing this is the best smelling one out
of all four I love how it smells the
color beautiful only con I have is that
the formula is a little more like gummy
and thick so we're really gonna zoom in
here you can see how the formula is very
thick see I'm just gonna put a little
bit on the edge trying to line the lips
it was a little bit harder than the
other three so that was my only con with
this one but the payoff looks beautiful
I love a blue based red like this
especially the blue hair it's stunning
I'm feeling like a mermaid oh oh yeah I
forgot that highlight right there damn
what's that current you lookin snitch
alright we have tried four colors my
mouth is tired let's get to my final
thoughts alright you guys so we tried
out
YSL we tried out Smashbox grill on and
Charlotte Tilbury and I gotta say all
four formulas worked like there's no if
ands or buts about it all of them have
their pros and their cons but overall
they were really consistently great
which is kind of shocking because when
you pick for luxury brands there has to
be a debt in there but there's not I'm
sitting here like I want to not like
something but there's nothing to know
like okay let's just start from the top
here Grill on was creamy great beautiful
I'm Charlotte Tilbury of course we just
tried that love it oh here we go though
it's at a tower where damn girl that
finger is and I've had this on for
minutes now I did not dry all the way
down but the coverage though is so
pretty
I could definitely overlook it but if
you want something really long-lasting I
would go with Smashbox and YSL obviously
it stained my lips and probably gonna
have that pink shade on my mouth for
like a week now but overall what is my
favorite Smashbox is the winner
this formula now I've tried the pure
mattes stunning this metallic blew me
away when they dried down there was no
transfer there beautiful there is a lot
of shades there's a lot of colors I
didn't even swatch of course today we
got purples we got browns I'm I'm down
I'm literally gonna log in and buy it
every damn color
oh and Smashbox was actually the
cheapest at $24 I don't even know if I
said this price point $34 this was 36
and then these were in the 20s matchbox
24 bucks for something that actually
works with a lot of different colors I
think that's the winner people thank you
so much for watching this video and all
right you guys thank you so much for
watching this I'll see you on the next
one
