channel today we are going to remove all
of this gorgeous makeup yes we really
are actually today we are testing out
the new Urban Decay brand new meltdown
makeup removers there are three items
today that they put out now recently
they have been putting out so many
products so they put out a bunch of
stuff that basically you prep the skin
and you take away all your makeup so
it's basically a whole onslaught of
amazingness you are someone that wears a
lot of makeup and you are a cake base
you are a mannequin you are a beauty
killer you are someone that just loved
to paint then you are definitely going
to want to watch this and of course if
you just want to watch it and you don't
even really like makeup and you want to
see this bitch remove all of this then
you better continue watching alright
guys let's jump right into it so I'm
going to put my hair back before the
show goes on and earlier I filmed a look
on this crazy makeup it was a full face
of first impressions using all products
I've never used before so watch out for
that later in the week and yeah so I'm
just going to clip my hair back right
now so I know I get asked all the time
oh my god you have long nails how do you
take out your contacts I honestly just
look up and bam it's just that easy guys
so basically we have a dissolving spray
it has a vitamin A in it is oil free and
it's supposed to just dissolve the
makeup immediately and then we have a
cleansing oil stick oil to micro foam
it's hydrating it has root extract in it
okay honey and then we have a lip oil
stick which has a vitamin E it
conditions and it is supposed to remove
now I'm wearing a liquid lip today this
is my own shade it's called Dream House
and it is a very pigmented and it does
not come off so it will be interesting
to see how this works on it and I guess
this is supposed to just be applied to
the mouths and then it melts so let's
get to melting everybody I think I want
to try this spray first or maybe we'll
just try it all at the damn same time
but let's open this up now this says to
just spray onto a cotton ball and just
wipe away okay so it's that easy huh
alright you guys so Zee
solving spray and the oil stick both
retail for $26 each now for makeup
remover is that expensive I don't know I
use a lot of like Mak wipes I don't
really use anything that dissolves
except that Clinique take the day a bomb
that one works amazing also the lip oil
stick retails for $15 so is it a good
deal I don't know let's see how well it
works and then we'll talk about it
well the Koch uses is oh my god it's
like literally like a lipstick whoo what
it's like clear okay cool
I think should we try to let first let's
try it and it will melt off the rest of
this space so the lift you guys let's
read the instructions it says to use
apply all over your lips and wipe off
repeat lips will be clean moisturized
and ready for another coat
all right so BAM that's it as a cute
little applicator and it says we're just
supposed to apply to the mouth and see
what happens so let's see what happens
mmm it's nice okay I'm just going to
wipe on the back of my hand once to get
it going see what it looks like
oh it's shiny okay let's try it all
right let's coat the entire top lip
all right you guys I'm like wait a
second I'm gonna feel it and see if any
comes off Oh
oh it does all look at that oh wow it's
like gone you guys okay I'm just gonna
be really fun and dramatic and see if
this comes off oh my god it dissolved
off like BAM holy shit okay just for a
test to see how well the other products
work I'm gonna keep myself looking like
I just sucked a dick for like 20 hours
and I just really want some fucking
dinner dinner dinner and we're gonna
move on and let me take off these lashes
oh all right now let's take this
dissolving spray now my gonna shake this
let me see spray onto a cotton ball I'm
just honestly going to spray it onto my
face because I want to know it's new
Wynn nut then comes out oh there we go I
like used to setting my face this is
gonna be so weird
whoa it is so much shine II know I have
a lot of foundation on so even on my
neck okay I am also going to unbox the
stick
it says apply directly to dry skin
always clearly missed that mark already
because I just sprayed my entire face
but it does look like this now my lids
are not that coated I might just take
this and put it right on my lid oh my
god oh I am shook my eye makeup just
melted ah holy shit Oh alright I'm just
going to take this and wipe it under I
have this crazy yellow mascara and I do
not want it on anymore I'm gonna wait
two seconds and let's see what happens I
just kind of want to like wipe
everywhere let me get my hair again out
of my face
okay so I sprayed this on my face it's
been about like 45 seconds 60 seconds
and there's no burning there's no
tingling I just feels like completely
like normal it just feels like it
doesn't feel heavy which is awesome so I
am going to just smear it around and see
what happens for a second
Oh oh my god the spray or maybe it's the
stick smells so good it's like pear so
that's all the pear oh my god it smells
so yummy okay let's see this is gonna
dissolve my makeup off you guys
whoa it's like literally melting off all
right you guys I have a damp washcloth
so basically the spray says apply to
face and wipe away and the other one
says to spray on a cotton ball well girl
I just want to see how well will work it
is melting everything off so I'm going
to take this washcloth I'm about to ruin
it and huh oh my god all my foundation
gone like literally whoa look at that
guys let's do more on the side whoa holy
shit you guys know I had a lot of powder
on earlier add a lot of foundation and
hmm it's just coming right off Wow
there's such a drip and the SAP it this
formula has no alcohol in it which high
anti-aging you know I'm not about that
alcohol life is amazing like that's so
cool that they got a formula that didn't
need to be harsh on the skin whoa even
the mascara came off like oh my god okay
said if your lips were stained or if
there is any like residue to go back
over it so I'm definitely going to go in
a second time with the lip oil stick so
let's do that that's good too now for
the makeup underneath my eyes usually
I'll do like a cotton ball or something
I'm just going to do this for a second
maybe I'm the only one but I kind of
like this look like I don't mind it but
of course this is a makeup remover video
so I will play by the rules and I'm just
going to take a little bit of the oil
stick I was going to put it right in my
waterline oh this is one that smells
like pears it's so yummy it's like mmm
I'm like hungry now okay so we're going
to take a clean cotton circle and just
oh wow a lot came off now let me wipe
off the lip oh yeah look there's a lot
more little pink stains okay Wow now
usually what I do I'm going to give my
skin a second and then seal it and tell
you guys exactly what's going on let me
clip this hair after I remove any liquid
lip I always like to exfoliate my mouth
and rehydrate it so if you guys don't
use a lip scrub I highly recommend it it
doesn't have to be mine but mine are
edible they are infused with a vitamin E
and aloe vera and this is the spearmint
flavor and I'm just gonna take some I
like to take with my finger like so of
course you should do it over the sink
and not your makeup station but hey and
just exfoliate hmm oh my god it feels so
good and then if it really twisted you
like your skin and clean hmm like a
midnight snack alright you guys so my
hands are clean I got clean fingers and
I'm just gonna feel my skin
wow it's feel soft
I was afraid is gonna say like really
strict or dry you know sometimes have to
use makeup wipes or remover it's like Oh
help me but my skin feels good I mean
obviously I love to moisturize after and
I love to tone but overall it feels
amazing and I just because I want to get
all that makeup off I'm gonna go in with
my favorite toner by Sicily this is the
floral toning lotion it has been in my
favorites videos before oh my god I mean
you know I've loved urban decay for a
long time so whenever there's a new
product out on the market I'm always
like yes bitch let me try it and I will
say I think that the star of the show
was the dissolving spray it's crazy how
quick it took everything off now it just
say powerful and gentle on there which I
after looking at the ingredients I'm so
happy because this is an oil-free
formula there's no alcohol or harsh
ingredients in it so this is pretty cool
and it's allergy tested and my skin
feels really good I'm kind of like
shocked to be honest I'm like oh okay
I mean you never know what to expect
when you're trying something new so when
it actually really works well I'm always
like yes all right you guys and the lip
remover really worked it broke it down
immediately I did have to go in twice
but it says on here that you would so it
didn't lie didn't say anything that it's
not supposed to do and all this stuff's
like really worked amazing so I'm going
to use this for the next month and see
how I'm loving it see if my skin feels
any other type of way but right now my
skin is feeling really nice it
definitely wants a tiny bit of hydration
there we go now I'm feeling a little bit
more like myself um cool I'm uh that's
it you guys I can't believe that I'm so
used to putting on so much makeup I'm
like oh my god I took it off this is so
weird but thank you guys so much for
watching let me know it down below in
the comments section which product you

favorite one was or if you've tried it
