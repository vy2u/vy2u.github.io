color-changing makeup we have a blush
that is black and it's cream and it
looks gothic and insane and I'm kind of
here for it yes we also have a lipstick
that's black and sparkly and it's
supposed to change colors something
drastically different and then if that
wasn't enough brother
I mean honestly we have another crazy
changing thing what this is the lipstick
and I don't even know what the hell it
looks like because I just bought it and
I have no idea
so we're gonna test it out now laura has
actually tried out blush older version
of just one exactly and if you would
have watched my channel you would
already know the outcome
okay well alright you guys so if you
want to see us try out all this crazy
shit thank you for watching all right
Laura Lee so excited to try this one out
oh my gosh so this is the black lace
rabbit blush from the brand lipstick
Queen right now a lot of people roll
their eyes because her lipsticks are
very expensive yeah like their high
price point right how much of this blush
twenty-five dollars high-end makeup it's
not the end of the world but it
definitely ain't cheap and it no and it
is a little small yeah we'll see on this
channel this is a cheap item okay yes so
this is what you get it is a the lace
covered thing yes there is 0.7 ounces in
here which is 2 grams okay let's open it
up with sparkle okay wow it is a
literally look what's crazy oh it does
have glitter in it I mean I'm excited to
try that remember when I made a black
highlighter last year for Halloween and
the whole internet dragged me and to
fill yeah they did I'm like oh I don't
know how many staples chalk jokes I've
heard in my life but it's ok I made 5
million off of it alright anyway anyway
on the realty is people have fun man
black highlighters black blushes I'm
down for it yes but this is color
changing so it's not supposed to stay
black it says that it turns a sheer
berry color on the cheek to complement
your unique skin tones it's a touch of
gold shimmer ok hold on here it also
this is a sexy haunting and first in the
beauty world a black blush definitely
think it's first Geoffrey they beat you
to the punch
okay I'm a little mad I'm like oh I
guess mine is not coming out anymore now
how do they recommend that you apply
this so whenever I used it you could
apply it with your finger or like a date
from Beauty Blender just pat pat okay
what about a dry Beauty sponge yeah
totally okay so why don't we try I think
we should try one on one cheek and the
other end of the cheek okay cool and
then the lips will wipe off what we have
in our mouths and we'll try that in a
minute so let's just try the blush first
I'm dying to that just wanna just I
think you should swatch around with your
finger okay we're gonna take a clean
finger here okay clean finger mm-hmm
this finger wasn't Laura and it's about
ten minutes ago it came out clean look
at your finger right now you're gonna
freak out oh wow it was like Barry looks
like I squished a barrier between my
fingers that's I think that's really
cool I want to do it they did black and
- Barry oh it's super creamy she was
going with her fingers great honestly
it's already all over a hand okay let's
go for it I'm down to try it we can take
a beauty sponge as well oh it has a
mirror with it yep okay we're trying
ready one two go oh I didn't know you
slapped me across my face yesterday my
concealer didn't show so we got a
buffett and we can't we can't yet are
you this is a little bit and I have a
medium skin tone show this is a little
bit strong mm-hmm
oh and I have you got a punch to the
face get done I'm sharing it is Li not
so bad for me it's actually really
pretty I'm not kidding I'm like oh I
mean my finger is almost like it looks
stained like yeah your finger is okay
look it is okay right here oh and we're
stained I can imagine it would stain a
brush or a sponge I'm just gonna take it
and kind of share it down a little bit
it doesn't right let me do a little bit
more in here let's try it with the
Beauty Blender okay oh I don't know why
I you know I did like uh-uh-uh
and then start tapping it out and it
turned out really pretty on my skin tone
obviously it is a jar yes less is more
as a super dark product so I mean I'm
not looking I'm not hating it you guys
know that it's kind of buff yeah you
know what yeah I think you have to work
with it you do and I think
probably a little bit less so let me do
a swatch my hand just for shits and
giggles yeah I want to see it
looks like shit and then once you like
really work it it's not so bad yeah your
first swatch look look like Kim cake so
you got to step up your pussy bitch she
knows how to swatch now okay well we had
a moment we're good it was good let her
swatch she's learning how to swatch
leave her alone okay
no it's actually pretty yeah it's really
pretty actually adore it
it's not very sticky I just want to say
pretty much dried down snow ah but
here's the thing
did you see the glitter anywhere on your
face zero so the glitter is just
encapsulated you know butter there's not
one drop of glitter so I would just say
they put that in for shipping google
says I don't know where the glitter
winch but it's not there anymore it's
there in the pan you can look close up
it's there but it doesn't really come
off on the cheek or skin it doesn't look
at my swatch no littering shear lives
okay since we're on the blush
let's pop out the Frog Prince blush yes
so this is the one that I've tried
before and I'm excited for you doesn't
want to pain yeah okay I love the
contrast of pink and green whoa
so this one looks really crazy it's
green I kind of wish it was it was day
green yeah okay so we're gonna go out
there finger get it this is a great bit
lighter let me do next to mine okay let
me do it on the cheek see I already flip
this is too much I want to do with the
sponge wait I just want to do like right
on here real quick what's like pink oil
yeah vanishing like almost goes back
dirty D see that looks clear yeah
oh oh this is more like a softer flesh
like this looks like I just finished the
gangbang and I got a towel to wipe off
all the fucking calm okay actually kind
of like this I like them both and I feel
like they look almost identical though
on my cheeks what do you think um okay
let me do oh there are doing a little
bit same you look at me pretty but it
looks the exact same so so actually now
that you're saying that I'm pulling back
the mirror very identical look no they
really are like oh yeah I mean it was
anyway that's kind of pretty - I like it
a lot huh I mean honestly I'm not one to
like use a cream blush every day I don't
like I don't really either like they're
not like my favorite but at the end of
the day I reviewing the product it works
yeah this one all right we got to a
color-changing lipsticks here - morning
sunshine
and mine is black lace rabbit okay
both have 3.5 grams in them what else
does this thing say let's take this out
so they're 24 bucks apiece okay that one
says it sheer black with a fine gold
shimmer a mysterious black flip six is
like stockings hugging and accumulating
the curves at your mouth for a fuller
looking lips so fucking dramatic so
sheer that has the effect of wearing
black lace on your lips worn alone it
casts a smoky veil worn over another
full coverage lipstick it trims it
transforms the color into a sexier
smokier version we had to put it on we
can have it I can try it alone and you
can try it with it or we can oh wow look
at the glitter you guys yeah that is
cool let's show that Wow
and then what is that one okay I have
never tried this one oh it's in this
pretty blue packaging in yellow right
yeah it's really pretty oh my god yellow
hey Alex fuckin boy geez
just want to eat it I know me too cool
let's both try another so laura is this
crazy ass yellow shit it's supposed to
transform your lives into a beautiful
bright coral shade and it's super
moisturizing apply straight from the
bullet as is needed for the perfect
colored lip okay if you think coral is
perfect it's basically telling you that
it's perfect without trying it well kind
of like that fucking plan beep Ellie did
the other day I'm kinda nervous tries
out my crystal shoes no it's a lip scrub
no let's redo it I love how clear it is
wait it's changing now it is a little
bit icy like right here my crust mm-hmm
and her crust fucking hell I never
thought hear that it is changing very
faint okay so I buried you like a hand
swatch to you this is annoying it's
Sophie
so for $24 you get a lip smackers look
ten yeah basically great my turn all
right so let's watch the black lace
rabbit lipstick guy should ask Geoffrey
what he tells me when I ask about
personal life advice the honesty it's
just painful it hurts but it's so real
all right let's try this okay sleeping
smut on your lips huh
no surprises what if I went to my
grandfather's ashes on my fireplace took
a wet finger and dipped in and then
rubbed it on my mouth honestly that
looks so weird and I hate it and I know
you like your dramatic moments but this
is not one reminds me of he had me that
black lip gloss over there mister my
traditional black lip gloss for my July
flops can I try that on it's the same
thing where it's supposed to darken a
lip but it just doesn't like translate I
hate that great well I'm getting really
pinky by the way it is
yeah I don't get that's gonna draw it's
gonna transform the lip into a smoky
sultry moment the gloss is really pretty
like if you just focus on the shine it's
too much of oh great here looks like
staying
kind of oh great alright so let's try to
put this over a lipstick yes next test
which shade is that I don't know Kitty
birthday suit
alright that is on okay here we go ready
Oh Drake II don't do it
ready I don't hate it as much good as
the bottom versus the top I mean kinda
looks like a new just a new lip color at
the same time it looks really smoky and
weird I'm not obsessed with it but I
don't hate it as much as I did
I kind of like it yeah I almost turned
to like a little mob oh I like turns
things moppy
wow it was like a smoke on it okay look
now by itself we all know it was a mess
but right now let's see the whole mouth
no it's supposed to like alter the
lipstick it gave it a darker hue
obviously yeah okay but let me just keep
it real time I wouldn't put on a
lipstick and then put on a lipstick to
make it darker I would just go find this
color exactly 10 million lipsticks out
we can get whatever color I'm not
someone that does a bunch of layering
like I love lip toppers and I love gloss
but I wouldn't really put onto the lip
six really you know what let me just say
it
okay I think it's a gimmick gimmicky and
I think the blush is pretty not so much
but I think this is just a little bit
gimmicky oh well I guess there's Laura's
final thought all right I think we can
sum up our review let's get to it
Oh Lord basically summed up the whole
video the blush worked for us yes look
at you in the monitor it looks really
pretty it does look pretty and fleshy
and like healthy glow but I think the
colors are the same they are honestly I
understand like what I at first I was
like no this is a little like whatever
and then I look back and I have you
blend it out you can't tell their
friends identical so basically they're
selling the same product twice is that
smart or horrible yeah I don't think
that was this many yeah you a different
shades name so lips I think this is a
bus is like you says has smackers for 24
bucks and then this one I think is a
gimmick didn't love it you know I'm just
like uh girl oh my girl if we really
want to like have a
lipstick there she is is that weirdo let
me show you how to put on a black
lipstick I'm so sorry ma'am you best
mirror guys it runs now that I got my
new Dave your last family reunion
alright thank you guys so much for

channel for some more laughs because it
doesn't stop oh we fucking know how to
do huh

you on the next one my lady's mommy I
think I've been sucking off a corpse I'm
a ninja by the way that's disgusting
