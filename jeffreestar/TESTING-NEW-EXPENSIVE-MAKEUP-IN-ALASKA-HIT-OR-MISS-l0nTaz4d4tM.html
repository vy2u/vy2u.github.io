channel hi how are you today I am an
hour outside of Anchorage Alaska in a
small town called Girdwood and I'm at
this beautiful ski resort and as you can
see behind me the view is stunning if
the glaciers go girl should I was gonna
do it get ready on a glacier but it was
a little cold and I couldn't do it so
we're in this stunning room and we're
about to do a full face first
impressions trying out expensive as
makeup now over the last few weeks I
have accumulated a lot of stuff through
stuff that botton and gotten through PR
so I thought why not sit down try it all
and see if the price is really worth it
on some of these items now as you guys
can see I'm in a very large room it may
be a little echoey we're gonna try
everything that we can in our power to
make sure I don't sound like I am
doubling and talking to myself I think
we're just gonna dive into this video
let's see what the hell happens and
let's do this full face to get ready in
Alaska alright so the first thing that
we're gonna grab here which is very
perfect for my lifestyle is the summer
fridays jetlag masks now when I saw
jetlag I was like I can relate all right
so I have never tried this before I've
seen it floating around online and I'm
like I gotta try this honey I've been on
eight flights since January so sign me
up we're gonna apply a thin even layer
with our fingertips and leave on for 10
minutes is it gonna work or not well I
have not anything yes today feeling a
little dry kind of like like the
glaciers behind me so let's pull it out
this is what it looks like oh you get a
lot of product let's just keep it really
real here oh it smells really fresh you
guys know I love a good smell test okay
well that's a lot okay it smells very
hydrating so I'm just gonna take a thin
layer like it said right here and let's
put it on our skin and let's see what
the hell happens okay so we're just
gonna apply it over so you're not gonna
rub it in and it says may be used under
and over the eye area Wow okay you guys
so
really go in here all right it is
applied very evenly on my face it does
feel very like oh so let's just give
this ten minutes now we'll be right back
all right so this is been on for 10
minutes now it says that I can wipe it
away if I want to but I think it really
sunk into the skin it doesn't like feel
weird it just feels very like but you
know I'm a skincare junkie so let's run
a little bit more now there is something
new from milk makeup it is the
watermelon brightening serum now this
retails for $36 okay for a little stick
you better relax milk but they do give
you a lot of product and now this does
have a 1.2 fluid ounces which is a lot
of product this is going to help with
our uneven skin tone and wrinkles girl
Simon yet now this time smell like
watermelon we're gonna have a problem
let me just put this on the back of my
hand and see what it feels like
oh it's cooling it not really getting
watermelon I don't get much okay well
I'm gonna take this a little bit we're
just gonna put under our eyes it just
been a long day and a little bit
where we feel that even and yeah I don't
even know how to put this in you guys
I'm a similar is gonna kind of rub it in
all over we're just gonna really prep
our skin and then one extra step before
primer because we're gonna be so bougie
I have been testing this out for a month
now and I didn't want to say anything
because I don't like when people review
skincare or toners and they've tried it
like once you definitely cannot give a
real review so this is the Madonna MDNA
skin rose mist refreshing balancing
elixir now this retails for $125 I was
like girl looks like this spray it out
now this bottle it is about not halfway
but it's getting there and this is
really good before makeup it's so
hydrating you do need a primer I love me
a good primer right now there is one
that just hit the market and this is
going to be retailing for a hundred and
eighteen dollars I'm like now this one I
had of course not
yeah but I've been dying to know this as
a primer of course brand-new and if I'm
looking at my phone here it is going to
be something that is an anti-wrinkle
primer it is going to deliver a powerful
age repair and firming benefits of the
serum while also doubling as a colorless
corrector okay so this is going to
visibly correct even the deepest
wrinkles smooth the skins micro surface
and reduce imperfections guaranteeing
results even on aged damaged skin I love
that now this is a glass component let's
try this out so I'm just gonna take a
little bit of my fingers and I'm sure
right now you guys are like gently
that's a lot of stuff to be putting on
your face oh it smells just like all
their like amazing skincare I'm just
gonna rub this down all over and let's
see if it's gonna him you know reduce or
take away anything so I'm not gonna look
in the mirror I'm just gonna rub this in
all over all right you guys wow this
feels really good my forehead wrinkles
go a little smoother they look a little
cute overall I'm not like blown away or
wow by this primer but you can
definitely see some blurring which I
live for a blurring primer and it looks
cute so far is it worth one hundred
eighteen I don't know I need alright so
we just punched in a little closer I
want to really really get the Realty on
this foundation so I want you guys to
see full-on how it's gonna look so today
we are testing out the new $60 Chanel
ultra we're full Ollis foundation lord
help me now I did buy two shades 12
beige rose and 20 beige now in the
powder I do use 20 beige but never know
with foundation but comes in a box like
this now that there is one fluid ounce
in this bottle which is very normal for
a foundation and when you pull it up at
his glass thank God was for sixty
dollars plenty if I had a plastic bottle
I was about to fight let's give it a
shake so this is No
transfer will see later tonight and it
is oil free I'm just gonna take a beauty
sponge right here from Beauty Blender
now I was gonna use the new Sephora like
little cute shell but the divots here I
don't want to try and foundation out on
the sponge like it up so I don't
know what this works or not
we'll have to see later let's take this
out we're going in with shade let's try
it 20 all right I'm just gonna put some
on the back of my hand and let's bounce
and see what happens
wow you guys look at how much foundation
that like maybe a little bit absorbed on
the sponge but I'm going to definitely
need a lot more let's do three more
pumps now as you can see it looks a
little yellow on my skin but there once
I've blended in I'm actually really
liking how this is looking
if a foundation is blended now it did it
dry a little quick so I had to move
around a little fast with my sponge but
first impressions I gotta say Chanel is
doing me good because overall it is a
very full coverage I only put on one
layer now sometimes I go in again and
again but like you do not need my second
layer with this I took it all the way
down to my neck it covered up all of my
insecurities and yeah it looks
bomb I'm kind of shook about it next
step only thing that I do not have is
concealer I know you guys there's really
no new concealers out that I've heard of
or that I saw in mind but even though
this is a testing out expensive product
video we are being the drugstore
concealer now lately I've been using the
touch of pearl for under my eyes if I'm
just like on the go but we're gonna pull
out a seven dollar concealer that I
approve a while ago it has been selling
out like candy and Ulta makeup
revolution seven dollars and the
works
now you guys you never know if the
foundation a concealer are going to mix
together I have had some horror stories
for the concealer just sits on top of
the foundation so weird but so far so
good yeah that concealer is drying
quickly - the foundation is like don't
try me let's move on just setting powder
now since I always use my live mayor
Bujji is setting powder which we
all know is my favorite I am going to
switch gears a little bit and use the
Patrick Starr Mac under eye setting
powder oh my god girl not even stronger
eyes for everything for steady concealer
for sending your whole life this formula
is amazing and I mean lipstick Nick I've
been using this obsessively the bitch is
almost out of her is I my girl so we're
just going to take that and put it all
where the concealer was and set this mug
all right now we're just going to wipe
away the setting powder which it really
kind of melts into your skin so gonna
put a wet boy much and I love that all
right now I'm gonna set the whole entire
face with foundation powder right now
you're like bitch I mean how much you
put on your face we're going in with the
ultra we're flawless foundation compact
okay this is the compact version and
this does retail for $60 I know jesus
take the wheel
I'm just gonna put this everywhere where
there was not concealer and really just
set the face oh right now let's do a
little bit of bronzing a little
contouring on these cheekbones and we're
going to use the Charlotte Tilbury
film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow now this has
been out for a few years or more but
I've never used it on my channel and I
saw it online and I'm like girl I gotta
have this so this retails for $68 and it
comes with one contour shade and one
highlight now this is supposed to be a
little bit of a universal shade is that
true I don't know about that but we will
take our bougie as a charlotte
tilbury powder and sculpt brush that is
supposed to go with this this is going
to let C blend onto your cheek hollows
temple with jawline sides and tip of
nose and of course the highlight in here
is it even blending though let's try
that out because if it's not we're using
something else oh oh it's alright it has
a little bit of shimmer to it I'm more
interested in just of course the bronzer
so let's take our bronze brush and let's
sculpt this face let's see what happens
okay I got a big face I got to put that
down and look into this star there we
okay definitely soft and gentle
I'm never going to just take this and
put it on the jaw now this is definitely
buildable which I actually don't mind
sometimes you put on bronzers or
anything like this and it can feel like
really heavy-handed and you're like oh
boy all right I'm just chiseling my nose
with this makeup forever fan brush okay
so face is looking cute so far the next
step would be blush now there is a brand
new brush from Benefit Cosmetics and
this is the gold rush blush this retails
for $29 what does it say on here sweep
on this rich golden nectar blush for a
stroke of luck right you guys so I think
what I've heard is when you open it up
of course there is the brush all benefit
bronzers employers come with and then
the top of this is I guess an overspray
of gold so there is I guess some color
underneath here it says custom golden
nugget design and over spray that
gradually lifts away to reveal a rich
golden shade infused with delicate
golden flecks sweep on this nectar blush
for a rush of glittery pleasure okay I
see what you did there aren't you guys
so I don't know if this is going to show
up let's take a lush brush and let's see
what is gonna happen oh wow the gold
definitely comes off way quicker than I
thought so it is a very thin overspray
soon as the brush heads in it reveals
what is underneath so I do have a little
bit of gold on my brush here let's see
what happens let's just put it right
where it with the blush mmm I just
I'll be good okay I'm not seeing much I
see a tinier shimmer from where that
gold was but I'm not living for it so
let's get into the actual shade which
here it comes and I'm just gonna put
that in the apples of my cheeks just to
warm them up a little bit so I don't
look like a dead cold-hearted bitch all
right now this blush isn't very subtle
and not normally you know I'm a high
pigmented bitch I love things that are
very easy like BAM right away but a
buildable blush is nice because
sometimes I see people I don't my room
girl she like took the whole pan and
went
now let's move on to a highlight now
today bitches let's see what we've got
going on now we have the new cover FX
highlighting palette this is the gold
bar with three shades and when you open
it up it looks like Vince okay I also
got this new bouncy highlighter from as
you Vashi so let's unbox her and let's
see what it looks like okay it's a
little smaller than I thought not that
mad at it and let's open her hat so when
you open it up oh wow
smaller than I thought but the design is
really pretty like they went there with
that design now the shade is called
African light gold it is shade 0-1 it's
made in Italy and on the website it is
before I even touch it a limited edition
jelly highlighter with a cooling effect
that leaves a golden shimmery finish
this formula can be applied to high
points of the face for a dewy finish I
think we're gonna have to give it a
whirl now this does retail for $41 I
wish the pen was a little bigger I'm
like girl but let's take a clean finger
oh wow it does feel like wet and cool
which is very weird okay it's a little
subtle but I do have a trick that we're
about to do so let's take a little
highlighting brush so we'll put the
cream down and maybe cover FX over it oh
wow I literally just watched a whole
entire
the brush looks a little wet let's do
what happens oh whoa that finger swatch
did not do it justice because putting it
on my face right now it definitely looks
when it first hits the skin I was like
mmm
now I'm kind of like okay she's cute
okay not the most blinding and not the
best eyeliner on the world but it
definitely gives you a little bit of
something for $41 though finish a washy
little under underwhelming but it's
still cute now we'll put her over here
we have to try the cover FX and gold bar
highlighting palette now this does
retail for $39 for three shades now
let's go in with the middle shade here
it is called white gold and then we'll
do a little mix of 24 karat gold let's
hope it's a little more blinding than
this and we're just gonna put it right
over the cream so it probably is going
to look nice oh there we go honey yes is
accentuating my pores a little bit that
primer is gonna get a little
reprimanding once this video is over
yeah definitely with the cream under it
it's gonna be really blinding we're
gonna put a little bit all right here
above the Cupid's bow oh wow bitch it's
blinding all right highlight color of X
you did good now I think it's time to
move on to the eyes all right you guys
now I've been waiting to use this for a
month I know there are so many mixed
reviews I have seen the internet go in
and I always do when the price is very
high for something so of course I am
talking about the no Chop Shop they're
known a tropic palate now this bad boy
comes in a stunning blue aquatic plastic
it is very hard and sturdy this does
retail for a hundred and twenty nine
dollars let's open her up this is what
you get in the palette I love it it's
like wow the color story is stunning now
I have heard that the shimmer shades may
be a little iffy I don't know whenever
and of course so let's dive in here and
let's see what we're gonna be serving
today all right so I'm gonna go in with
shape pastel melon is this shade right
here and let's just put this on my lid
and let's see what happens now I did not
know this shade was gonna show this dark
on me you guys so I'm definitely like
okay we're really gonna put something in
the crease we really do put them on my
face paint all right I'm gonna take a
little bigger brush this is from Bobbi
Brown and I'm actually gonna go in with
peach melon and fake tan and kind of do
a little mixing a little cocktail if you
will we're gonna put that bite crease
we're just gonna put that right in there
and that's alright you guys the Sun is
literally creeping up behind me so if
there's any weird lighting my apologies
you guys know how it is when I travel
but I think we're actually pretty good
but look you guys when I go in a little
bit oh there's the Sun okay the color
that's really like speaking to me is
mint Frost right here and then exotic
like I just need to use those for some
reason they're calling my name
so Brittany's a little Chanel brush this
is an expensive review so let's do it
now is this formula it's supposed to be
used wet or dry oh wow the brush is cold
did let's see what's about to happen
buthe it's like helicopters all over yes
so moving on I'm taking that green and
it's not really blending how I wanted to
at the moment let's just take a little
bit more you guys see I'm really going
in now maybe these metallics are not
supposed to be blended out like this but
I need to blend this out so it's gonna
have to and now we're gonna go into
shade mint frost which is this guy right
here I've heard mixed reviews about this
one do I wet the brush prior okay let me
just try it with out putting it and I
know what if we really don't like it
will wet it I mean it's definitely there
it's showing up and it looks cute do I
want it more intense I need that so
maybe I will use a little bit of this
hydro beauty essence mist from chanel
girl do I have to have this this is like
their version of a mac fix+ just you
know quadruple the price there we go
that is the shimmer impact I was looking
for now I'm just gonna blend it into
exotic just to it fall
oh right that in a corner though it is
banging I love these two colors together
definitely they complement each other
like boom so it mixed that into the lid
it looks really really pretty I kind of
want to keep the under eyes very sparkly
and just kind of keep it moving alright
now we're gonna take this hot yellow
shade called a lemon cello I believe
it's an alcoholic drink I actually just
heard about it Italy for the first time
so let's take that shade it definitely
needs to be wet as well so we're gonna
take this little Tom Ford brush let's
wet her down
actually it's not wet it let's see what
it looks like first dry I think that's
only fair because hi this is a first
impression oh wow wow that is a lot lord
have mercy so let's just take this and
let's tuck it
under there I'm being really delicate
here and not seeing a lot of payoff so
I'm going to wet the brush all right
we're gonna wet that I mean it's in
there but I'm not like obsessed with it
and it's not like BAM so maybe it's
supposed to be a little more subtle for
$129 I was hoping this was gonna like
make me like come now for the under eye
I'm gonna go in with shade Sahara right
here or it's gonna dip into that as well
as fake tan we're just gonna mix these
two together and we're gonna put that
under my eye and just smoke it out
lightly I think the greens are having
their moment but I do want to take this
and blend it
all right the under eyes are smoked out
they're feeling a very snatch very
runway and I'm just gonna take that
shade that we were just putting under
the mixture just kind of going around
the green
all right the eyes are looking amazing
feeling very right away right now
I don't have any mascara so I'm going to
go quickly put on to the it cosmetics
superhero and I will be right back ooh
girl this side is really coming in hot
right now okay you guys so we're almost
there
mascara is on now we do want to do a lip
of course I might do false lashes
because I'm I don't know if I'm living
for no lashes I think we really need you
and we're gonna date tonight all right
now for the lip I do have a new lip
product that I've never used before it
actually just came out a few days ago I
have a bunch of them here it is the
brand new Tom Ford lip lacquer liquid
matte I don't even know what shades
these are I just bought them all online
pussycat let's open this one up here
whoo okay so this is what the component
looks like now that these retail for
about $50 yes 50 plus dollars for a
liquid lip Lord help me now this is like
a light pink definitely could match this
look let's see what other shades
quickly now I think oh no that's a
liquid matte as well there seems to be
two formulas here there is a liquid
patent as well like a patent like red
blue Wow is it glossy okay oh wow more
hot red I think we're just gonna go in
with the nude I know you guys
really bitch another do that I am just
feeling the nude oh wow that has sparkle
in it but not with this look
one more erotic let's do the shade oh my
god didn't know okay so we're gonna go
in with shade universal appeal all right
now I don't know if this is supposed to
drive down or what it's supposed to do
so let's just give it a whirl and find
out oh wow so here is what the Wanda
looks like it is Sol anted and is there
a smell oh it's like straight-up
frosting all right let's go in and see
what happens
all right I don't have any new setting
spray with that liquid lip though I
definitely is like a full-on liquid to
matte not coming off doesn't feel gummy
doesn't feel crunchy actually feels
pretty good all right I actually I'm
sitting on my feet right now because the
Sun is coming in crazy dinner is about
to start so I am glad that this a makeup
look is actually cute there's number
setting spray in the market right now I
wish there was but for now we're gonna
go back in with our Luigi Urban Decay
all nighter all right this face is set
makeup is done all right you guys I will
do a final thoughts later I thought it'd
be cool to actually go to dinner and see
how the makeup lasts throughout the day
so I know you're probably all dying like
okay what do you really think where did
the final thought let's give it a few
hours let's go to dinner and let's see
how everything wears and then we'll come
back later and weather the sun's out or
not we got an LED and we will do a few
check-ins and see how long all of this
 really glass so see you guys in a
little bit all right so I just threw on
some hooded beauty Farrah lashes they
weren't new so I didn't include them
when I was doing the impressions but
they really complete the look I love how
this is looking now Nate and a few
friends are coming over to have some
dinner time to get on the tram that is
literally suspended in the sky by some
cables so I'm just like oh god but
everything else is actually holding up
really well I'm just looking in the
mirror like do you own this foundation
though it was really really cute
but how will it last for the next few
hours we will see shortly so let's get
some food in the stomach and then we'll
give our final thoughts
alright so we just got on the tram we're
about to go really far up me Oh No okay
so I think I should sit here since it's
going up or does it go down ever
no UV movie flat the whole time but I
mean it's up to you on whether or not
you want to look up or look back let's
try here okay Oh besides that the makeup
out looking that's good I like it hello
papa green I like green alright let's
get this started
all right so we are officially in motion
I'm pretending this is a ride at
Universal Studios
Roberta kotoba sister the bars
it is really pretty though
almost videos as highlight
so dinner has started madam I love it
pop it pop it it looks really good okay
guys everyone at the table I want about
my skin besides a little cracking how's
the foundation mass I love it all right
so everything is pretty much intact
right now so we will see in a little bit
how everything is but everything's so
far so good okay all right so it has
been about four hours we had a crazy
five course meal I am so full I'm ready
to go hi I need some more actually I'm
lying okay so let's see what my face
looks like let's give our final thoughts
all right let's look at this face girl
let's see what's going on
Wow okay first of all what I'm noticing
right away the eye shadow no creasing it
looks beautiful
the formula is on point so first of all
Natasha Genoa I see you bitch now in the
past I have had some issues with some of
their metallic crystalline formulas but
girl
these ones definitely are amazing now
I'm sure a lot of you like are they
worth $129
that's up to you I think the packaging
is amazing the color story is beautiful
and you are getting a very high-quality
shadow so if you want to splurge and get
something amazing for yourself
definitely we recommend this no
foundation overall gotta see you guys
I'm pretty impressed it's very full
coverage there's no greasy mess it feels
amazing it's still very matte it's a
very full and I'm actually pretty
impressed because I didn't touch up once
and there's like zero creasing my
forehead
still looks intact so okay Chanel
foundation I'm gonna have to give you a
jeffree star approval because this
looks bomb and I'm definitely gonna be
wearing this in future videos now the
Chanel hide your beauty mist definitely
you do not need this this is very
overpriced I think she down to slap good
name on some you know morphe spray and
call it a day so we definitely would
recommend more
this okay so the lip I actually touched
up once only because I put a k'kaw gloss
over it and then I was eating a bunch of
stuff and I got a little weird so I
dabbed it off and put this a little bit
in the middle so it's looking pretty
good
it held up great tomforde a little
overpriced
but Boyd Mila is on point the
highlighter a lot of people saw my
highlight today in the restaurant you
can't miss this so I will say that
probably the combo that's making it
really blinding remember I did not try
this by itself we did put coverfx over
these you vache so I think when you
layer a powder over a cream you're gonna
get an amazing blinding effect or if you
just wanted quick fix
you just get Frost let's light that you
guys Madonna's missed so overpriced but
bitch ah feels so good the primer I
don't know if the primer did anything
