today I brought back the one and only
many MUA what is up guys today we're
gonna do something interesting we are
trying out the new hustler dole Delta
okay no but for real guys we are here
today to test out all of the new liquid
lipsticks from all the hot new brands
and some of your favorite brands hmm so
we got a lot of shopping we got a lot
here
we're like highly pilots excited to try
some new stuff from new brands and also
some of your old favorites have finally
made liquid lipsticks that's like
everyone has one now everyone and so I
feel like me and me we've tried a lot
we've tried every brand I'm trying to be
we no formula we no texture we no scent
and we know patty I think we're experts
by now I mean honestly by now come on
we've been doing this for a while now I
can definitely tell apart some liquid
lipsticks yeah what I like in which they
don't so we are gonna be unfiltered and
we're gonna just keep it real as usual
and we're gonna try a bunch of out so
pray for our lips please give me some
moisture what do ya what are we gonna
use in pajama we're we're using we're
going heavy-duty with where they asked a
lot like what do you do to take it off
in between takes I'm like I don't know
anything nice and sweet not something
crazy that's the clinic take the day off
ball by the way amazing alright cool so
let's dive into it so we ready the first
one is the Smashbox always on liquid
lipsticks they just came out with these
what like a month ago a month ago
they're they've been all over social
media and so I'm like do let's try these
out heard a lot of good thing yeah I've
actually used one only I haven't tried
to get I dived in and I bought the gray
one and I was like yeah I'm gonna try
the formula but the thing is with liquid
lips as you all know as consumers
pigments change formula yeah the color
looks huge difference huge difference so
like weird colors are harder to make
nudes and reds are a lot easier to make
sure if you notice inconsistencies in
brands that is why so today I'm gonna be
trying True Grit and I'm gonna be trying
a driver seat oh look at me I like that
name that's what they look like it's a
smaller component that I would expect
yes it's quite little there's our point
13 fluid ounces mine our point 19 okay
cool zipper just for
referent just for reference these are
$24 yes 25 bucks which I'm like damn can
we get a little more product like
honestly it's a lot it has less than
yours yours are what 18 yeah I mean
that's $6 more that's something so the
applicator is bent like my ex and it is
like that little see-through thing in it
yes again it's like the tech carry
product it's basically just hold more
product yeah and then it pointed so it's
like almost like a teardrop what do you
thing about the fragrance I don't hate
it don't hate it either
don't hit it all right let's give it a
whirl ah oh she's pigmented oh my god
it's literally so pigmented all right
away ah dude these are so whole
pigmented holy crap they're really
really lightweight and this is only for
me it was literally only one did I do
I'd have to do multiple tear drop shape
it's actually not too hard to apply for
me I'm not having a hard time line here
anything it's not bad huh no it's really
not it's a matte but it's not like I
can't see divots and crack yeah not like
the dry not drying it's kind of
hydrating yeah jojoba apricot and
sunflower oil mm-hmm that's really cool
has little good oils in it that's all
abouts also white it's more expensive
cuz jojoba oil is really expensive yes
I'm glad burn I usually use the tears of
my enemies in my formula that's why I
thought all right so we let it dry for
five minutes we've been talking we've
been laughing and sucking we've been
sucking and it's still holding up it's
still on already like it so what are our
final thoughts approved on my end mani
improved Geoffrey approve love it
alright let's try the next one alright
so the next brand we're gonna try is
bare minerals they recently just put out
some liquid lip didn't even know it
I'd no idea um I was typing in liquid
lips on Sephora and he's popped up now
there are so many different formulas of
liquid lips some are supposed to stay
some don't these ensue right yeah I mean
it says it's a liquid time at suppose
it's like long wear because some brands
don't promote long wear yes you know
what I mean they're not saying it's a
liquid to matte they're just saying it's
liquid lipstick and on your way yeah but
this one is allegedly long wearing creme
de matte layer with a lightweight Simoni
feeling just kidding so they are $18 and
they come in a matte component this
shade is called smooch and I have the
shade head you're better for me about
people yes so I would think you would
have to shade him right
I'm down kind of frosting me with a
little bit of chemical it reminds me I
honestly reminds me of the the Sunday
Riley Beauty oil that's literally as I
go that's cool it's almost like a
vanilla key but almost like with the
licorice 20 yes you know I don't mind it
I don't mind it too much right now but
we'll see how it is when I'm playing it
yeah
now the dough foot is flatter than my
chest and it's cute and sure okay so I
notice right away it's nice pigmented as
a Smashbox ones oh look right here it's
a little streaky a little Street a
little shaky Michael's cheeky that's a
definitely double layer this one after
you huh it just feels so smooth going on
it's a very very smooth creamy texture
it's not thin it's not too thin it's not
thick it just feels velvety almost oh
geez next nude is really streaky the
fragrance is a little strong yes it is
so exhaust you feel smelling it on my
lips like and kind of little intense
it's not like horrible where I wanted
warmer but it is like it's so aggressive
the scent
it's a little too stringy for me
strizheus it's streaky it really is I'm
really curious to see how it drives down
as it dried down on me yet still kind of
glitter I was like listen to it I don't
if you guys can see but it does have a
glisten I was a glisten alright so it's
been a minute or five yeah hasn't dried
down it's odd that I can look at my
finger look at the back of my finger
yeah and now Oh full pigment you try so
I don't know how if you'd be long
wearing um thank you buddy like long
wearing it just would does not drink out
Matt like even right the like
pop-culture statins those are long
wearing they're not matter which I get
but I wouldn't say to promote these as
being a mattifying known where kind of
percentage leave lipstick um alright
well they were a little too patchy for
me I definitely had to take a few layers
to get the color the color is really
pretty though they're stunning love it
um but this is not Geoffrey approved and
it's look again take it in honey that's
not many of you because I also don't
like the scent so alright everything
combined not food for me sorry where we
no don't brand but little bit about
doesn't like it okay so Estee Lauder has
a new lip product out this is called a
pure color Envy liquid lip potion
I love the name potion I just love that
me too much I'm very different like so
yeah I love the bush and the warlock
mine is called pierced petal strange
bloom I mean the names are almost as I'm
loving it
we have a look inside almost witchy
someone switching comes in this blue
metallic you didn't run very estee
lauder various an intensity yeah inch TV
room on it my boss on the top yl has
something kind of similar as well I've
seen before shading him on the bottom
this is cute boats it feels heavy
doesn't feel cheated does yeah feels
luxurious whoa those are the alligator
only shit what applicator is dealers let
me hold it oh maybe you should do it
this way to curve around your lip um so
my spin mitten huh that's different
like to do out mm-hmm ah here is a
little hard to use it is I'm not having
a trouble here mama
don't love it I'm flipping sides the so
holler nice I know you guys can't see
because it's really bright but it's not
really that pig I mean at first I
thought I was getting pigmented but you
can see street to the Lydia beauty thing
looks a little dull mm-hmm the product
tends to sit in that group so I have to
flip it
yeah I understand I like it's a fraud oh
it's freaky
okay um is it supposed to dry I don't a
lip potion like does that mean that
dries matte does it stay glossy I think
that it feels so comfortable it feels so
nice it's really lightweight so I was
not sticky it's really streaky yeah it's
freaking it's I feel like I'm like yeah
I don't care on me after two layers it's
not shaky a no it's not yours looks
great
yeah oh no I just see alright we also
forgot to mention because we just looked
this up $32 or $80 Jesus a girl
it just says a fluid lip color with the
potent effect of a lipstick okay so
basically a lipstick and a liquid form
is a liquid lipstick hybrid that leaves
lips plumped with continuous moisture
saturated with high intensity color
without sticky shine lips appear
sculpted and sexy my are sculpted and
sexy they are yours actually are great
my color I would say is manually a
but for the price for 32 bucks
oh I would I would let you say I
wouldn't pay $30 for it
that's what I'm saying I would not pay
for $32 for it no I would I just know I
wouldn't ever really wear it the same
let's say it's a food for what it is why
would not be $30 worth a man that's my
thing yeah so I'm not gonna buy it
all right next right next brand next one
is huda beauty yes now we've heard a lot
of stuff about these have not tried them
yet I was waiting for you yeah no I
haven't had to me there at all please
say long-lasting and comfortable matte
liquid lipstick intense pigmentation
helps to maintain the lips hydration no
transfer so I got shade trophy wife to
use and then grab flirt uh-huh I think
the packaging is adorable it's really
cute I think it's so clever of course
her lashes are like the ones that you go
like this component is really cute
components nice frosted bottle it's a
nice Mac had a logo these are $20 retail
$20 that's a great Morais start you bad
no my feels heavy I like how does it
feels nice Shriya nice go for applicator
oh oh very cake like as cakey it's
almost as if like cake and sunscreen on
TV all right let's give it a whirl let's
do it
oh oh that was shown on each that feels
so good
very nice mm-hmm the texture is thin and
lightweight full pigmentation full
pigment I love this color
more yeah I love mine too even and that
this is a color I don't really do yeah I
think it looks really pretty
yeah this was a little shame she smells
going away it's still drying down yeah
this is like maybe the only brand that
like it kind of feels like mine yeah
which is obviously not a bad thing no
good it feels really good it was like
yours is nice thin lightweight not dying
I love it it's a little sticky yes while
it's drying about you it is yeah so
we'll see how it goes once it's fully
dry and see if it leaves any kind of
tacky feeling all right well let this
dry and be right back
hold on it's it's kind of sticky which
not really a fan of that I think the
color is beautiful stunning the formula
itself is stunning the axe is going on
average is full all's it just feels a
little tacky model it's not um there's
no cracks in it it's not too drying no
it's very hydrating a nice hydrating
formula it just feels a little tacky but
I guess that's the only word I hate
stickiness in legal objectives on my
bigger puppies besides the stickiness is
this manning approve yes I actually
really like it even though it is sticky
I don't like that it's still in compare
as a total it's toilet yeah as a whole
one negative for me everyone sits great
I think I was great yeah so prove Jeff
your boot it's Jeffrey approved so the
next brand we're gonna try is color pop
pop boom they have news or fight we're
tickers um okay so um color pop just put
out a lot of new values of ultra
metallically yeah so many they just put
out a bunch of new metallic liquid a lot
of them which is I've heard so many
mixed reviews about these I've never
tried on myself
Oh on I'm not excited to see in my July
favorites I wore man-eater stunning you
did it was totally beautiful it was like
a dark like deep bronze and it lasted um
a long time but I don't think the
formula is consistent I mean we're about
to test it and see but just from the
previous colors these are all the new
ones we haven't tried these yet yeah I'm
just from previous experience
let's hit or miss so you never know got
it never know what you're getting I have
the color J I see what's up Sam Jake
mine is called flitter flitter you had a
cute name we better word flood murder I
pulled it out and there's like hardly
any product on it yeah there's barely
anything you're the actual applicator a
pair um almost as if it has like
frosting on it I'm gonna get my name
again cuz that was the first time I had
dipped it how's yours I have more
product for sure it still looks like
frosting tiny bit more but there's a
little bit more alright let's try it
I hate it mmm oh my god okay I've tried
one of these before it was amazing
Ali just has color what is this this is
like fairy dust mine literally has no
color payoff whatsoever it's almost as
if you just have reflect on your lips it
looks great it looks crazy
third time dipping in oh me too third
time to begin
mine's really streaky like
and after you like keep applying this
one it just takes off the product from
underneath well reversing is the genesis
of chunky litter - like it's chunky
yeah hmm now for $8.00 I think this
one's dead
that's not bad because I can't a
lipliner like adding red lip liner yeah
without all that be sick this one I
don't think it's worth $1 no alright is
it approved or not now not approved last
but not least we are trying the new CEO
days yacht moisturizing matte liquid lip
liquid velvet ooh
so it says liquid velvet alright come on
trademark pack with pigment and lip
conditioning hyaluronic acid oh you
better work apply one coat of this
moisturizing plush pigment colorful
long-lasting high pigment poker
perfection which should you get I have
to shade fast lane and I have a shade
Envy I'm going bold today with the full
lid of this video we're gonna hit it
with a bang
Feli huh oh this is really bright -
Alice 0.22 fluid ounces for how much 19
19 bucks so as bad not bad no and it's
mainly uh-huh hmm very SPF II like a
stock
sunscreen in your nose the one is it's
flat tapering tapered yeah papers up and
it has like a little hole in each side I
love the colors of ours though the sunny
yeah I stunning packaging like - it's
alright that's right oh wow huh oh my
god this color is sickening mine's a
little cheeky no mine's not Lucy hello
this ringi on the sides huh feels very
smooth going on though they really
moisturizing mm-hmm yeah so this is one
layer so I don't have to go in with two
cuz mine's more of a streak your
consistency
this one's really creamy yours looks
beautiful this color is fucking doe I
really love it it's so pretty yours is
so bright it's really bright I thought
if she looks really pretty I think mine
looks yeah ours together looks crazy
about a good way I love it so that's
sticky at all I'm reading I'm reading
what it says on the website creamy
non-drying lip formula so it's like it's
like I supposed to get moosie
consistency yeah and not not gonna dry
it out completely mad okay cool I think
with our bolder colors though it would
be nice to dry not fully yes especially
the color like this
this is kind of like forgetting a little
thing unforgiving mm-hmm well the color
is very unique and I'm really loving
this like a peacock greeny blue teal
music pea pot it is yeah okay awesome
mm-hmm I love it I love my color -
honestly it's really gorgeous
all right I'm a fan I think this is
gonna have to be Jeffrey proved honestly
I know I won't wear this like I know I
wouldn't wear a formula like this yeah
I'm gonna say stop it for me oh yeah
okay I feel you yeah it's nice that we
have different opinions knowing yeah
that's great I mean that's just what it
is
it does look matte now that it's been a
few minutes on it looks like velvet like
well they're claiming it looks like
velvet
which I like that claim I like the fact
that they claim that it's a velvet and
it looks like yeah mood as hell all
right final recap all right so we just
discussed and did our scoreboards of
best liquid lip and worse yes and why
are why do we have the same I can't even
believe that we have the exact same
honestly and we don't always agree and
we're like all right so let's start with
the bang the one we hated the most
girl this wasn't it for me it was not
I'm sorry I really wish it was it's it's
actually I feel like club pop is one of
those brands that has such bangers you
also have such like it's very later
don't like people don't like at all all
so do they love or they hate yeah and
this sadly is a hate for me yeah not
loving this at all but we have some
really great products like I made you my
drink
Highliner remember that's your generous
girl our favorite liquid Livi right was
Smashbox they killed it they really did
this huh Leigh such a pretty formula
don't see how nice this is East for real
fucking shook now I think we've tried
every liquid lip on the market thus far
and this is one of my all-time favorite
ooh I will say this is probably my top
three Anjali who the good news they have
like over 20 color yeah like they start
out with a bang I mean no they killed
