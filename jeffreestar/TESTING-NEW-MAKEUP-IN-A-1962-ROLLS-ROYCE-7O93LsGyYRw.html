with my all-time favorite Bobbi Brown a
vitamin enriched face base of course and
I've been really loving these morphe
brushes Beauty sponges they really
expand like fat and they just get all
over your face which I live for so I'm
just gonna put this all over my face and
get ready to put on some foundation baby
I was pretty hot out here today usually
it can be below freezing in these parts
of the world but today it's like 80
degrees here maybe 90 it was 90 in
Norway the other day you guys I was like
come on Calabasas what's good so I
reviewed this on my channel a few weeks
ago versus the nine dollar foundation
from the drugstore but this is the allah
mayer cushion foundation and i really
really love it you just take your sponge
you guys and go like that and a lot of
pride gets on there so i'm just gonna
cover my entire face and let's see how
this foundation works in a little more
of a humid climate alright we're just
gonna push this into our skin wow you
guys know in the sunlight or daylight
your face could look a little rough but
this formula i'm like i remember why I
fell in love with it when I filmed with
it so I'm sure a lot of you were like
Jeffrey you were in Finland last year in
October why are you back there again
since the first time we were there I
have expanded jeffree star cosmetics
into a lot of stores out here called
SoCo so we are celebrating the launch of
the Equality bundle we were in Norway
launching my brand in Vita exclusive and
we are just we're on an international
Empire growth everyone and I'm so
excited because slow and steady wins the
race
I when I first started my brand everyone
was like when you gonna be in all sense
before right away and I was like I want
to have full control at my vision my
brand my company this is my baby and
this is my entire life so we are being
very selective with who we work with and
we are just growing the way that I want
to grow and everything is just unreal so
we are doing three meet-and-greets out
here and we will be traveling a lot more
this year we might hit Australia UK
Russia we have a lot of amazing plans so
get ready
that baby I know I already did a full
video on the foundation but just wearing
it again I am such a big fan with the
way it looks I'm like its skin like but
plastic and I love that alright so no
new concealer today you guys until mine
drops later this year BAM but we're
gonna use the drugstore conceal and
define from makeup revolution and we are
almost out of this bottle PS you guys
were going over railroad tracks and some
cobblestones right now so bear with us
while I blend is out now who's ever done
their makeup in a moving vehicle because
girl I think I mastered it now we've
done rolls-royce get readies I started
that series when I first started my
channel actually we've done private jets
we've done a lot of stuff so I have some
more surprises coming for you guys later
this year but you know I like to do my
makeup on the go honey that's kind of
like a joke at my mean greets people are
like are you gonna do like a get ready
on my spaceship but get ready like and a
safari and I'm like all those ideas
sound great let me write them down only
on this channel but we set a nine dollar
concealer with a $44 setting powder but
you know this channel that's what we're
doing today so we have the new Marc
Jacobs finish line perfecting a coconut
setting powder this has 8 grams of
product and it is a invisible setting
powder allegedly and it does retail for
44 bucks so this is going to seamlessly
set my makeup who the packaging is cue I
love Marc Jacobs beauty they are very
consistent so let's open this up and see
what it looks like oh look at this
little thing it does of course have the
little protector here so let's open this
up we're gonna be very careful cuz we
are not about to get powder in this
vehicle oh wow okay so it looks like
this
and I'm just gonna take my sponge like I
always do and let's just oh it's like a
machine
girl let me just take someone pressed
under my eye and let's see what is going
to happen
it really does smell like coconuts it's
like actually yummy oh wow
so this foundation and concealer a
pretty luminous and look at the
difference you guys this is very like
I'm not like it's shiny but it's just a
very skin like with the setting powder
it's like full matte I love it I'm like
I'm actually kind of impressed right
away just because it looks so like
airbrush
mmm-hmm okay guys so far so good yeah
you never know what's gonna happen when
you try new products it's always scary
all right now we're gonna try the new
Cicely phyto touch Sun glow bronzing gel
powder now this retails for I think
about $85 my girl this has 0.38 ounces
in it that price point
lord have mercy okay so this is the
compact now I love Sisley so all tea no
shade this feels very drugstore like the
compact feels a very light and cheap so
when you open it up it looks like this a
little pattern I'm gonna take a little
morphe m-52 seven brush and let's just
see well first of all let's touch it
with our finger is how light is this
almost has like a little bit of Sheen to
it I'm like I did say cool with it
girl what does this box say Sun glow
okay I'm like just have highlighter in
it oh my god bitch this is so sheer okay
I'm like
okay let's get these cheekbones a whirl
and let's do what happens here okay I
can actually see it that finger swatch
was a little scary but you guys know you
can't trust a finger swatch let's just
dust this all around my big bald
forehead doing the jaw definitely sheer
I'm building up and building up oh my
god the cheek is so natural not used to
this come on natural star I'm happy
right now what is this place I've a
Polish dialect what is a ring is water a
park-like ah okay it's kind of the beach
vibes here the lighting in cars you guys
is always so tricky so I'm doing my best
blend with 20 different lights hitting
my face all right so the bronzer is laid
it is very sure you guys like normally I
wait till the end to say like
something's not worth it I think that if
you're a makeup lover and collector this
is very cute to have but it's definitely
not an accessory a necessity or an
accessory either and necessity sorry it
was it's cute though I think I actually
might grab this like again but was it
mind blowing no okay so we have new
flushes from when wild we have new fenty
highlighters I think we're just gonna
play with them all now of course the
kilowatts are $36 the wet and wild color
icon baked blushes are probably more
like $5 um so let's just give these all
a whirl and now these new wet and wild
ones are a limited edition they have a
cute little hummingbird on the pans
which I live for and I think the shade
don't flutter yourself is calling my
name so we'll pull her out and then
Rihanna put out a bunch of stuff you
guys
seven-day weekend in poolside look at
that I'm like good morning I want to
find the one that she wore here we got
mimosa sunrise and sangria sunset let's
pop open this baby ooh
okay this color though girl I'm like wow
full pigment very buttery oh we're
talking full pigment yeah that girl just
said hi to me hi Amy
all right so I'm just gonna test a bunch
of these out let's try a little blush
first I'm just gonna wipe these oh wow
okay I see the potential here all right
so I'm gonna dive into this shade right
here I don't know how sheer these are it
looks like they have like obviously
metallic in them which are similar to
Rihanna's but we all know Brianna's are
like this
like a fighter jet or what is that look
at that I ate yes bitch
oh wow this blush does have pigment
there is a little bit of glow to it
Oh a lot of glow when I turn my face
okay kind of wet looking - these are
very reread but we all know senti has
like a lot of pigment and shine not that
these don't but it'll be interesting to
see the
like us have way more highlighter than I
ever thought that's kind of shocking
okay
looking a little cute yay now let's bust
out miss rebury now the one where she
was using in her video in the bathroom
was this kilowatt foil freestyle sand
castle and minted Mohito this was the
one where she took the brush of course
the fenty brush and she took this shade
right here and just went oh and it was
like crazy what is that there must be
some crazy airplanes going on out there
because it is allowed okay I think it
stopped we'll see alright I'm just gonna
take this I kinda wanna do the other
ones first you guys so I changed my mind
and I'm gonna dip into this for a second
and I saw RiRi put this on her eyes
cheeks everything
I don't know how pigmented these are and
let's find out
oh my reread okay I'm just gonna put
this all the way up like we're going to
the Met Gala because this has it yes now
I know some of you at home maybe like
girl what the hell are you doing we're
just having a little artistic moment
today let me give me feeling my David
Bowie fantasy right now now just for fun
I'm going to dip to the other shade
called mimosa sunrise and let's do the
other side for fun or we can just
actually add it into here and really
take therefore the brow color it
these two together it's literally like a
sunset okay I've been a fan of this
bendy brush since it launched I love the
way it hugs the cheeks now I'm loving
for this little avant-garde a painter
moment I love how this is looking and I
think that this one let me dip into
mimosa sunrise one more time this one
might be my favorite I just love these
two colors together
Rihanna you killed it with this one okay
yes of course the eyes look a little
blank so it's time to open up a brand
new palette that may be launching on
June 16 of course we're talking about
the jeffree star cosmetics thirsty
palette which was just revealed a few
days ago and girl good morning today I'm
just gonna do a very soft little moment
because it's all about this today do a
little nude lip so of course I'm sure
you guys are like you can't do a first
impressions on your own brand I know
baby but we got to use it because it's
brand new I'm just gonna take a shade
parched right here
and we're just gonna put that on my
oh I love that I took the orange like
all the way in there these colors right
here are gonna look amazing all right
now we're gonna dip into shade tastebuds
right here and I just love popping that
right in that crease area where the
fenty highlighter stops this is gonna
gel really good with this and just kind
of blend together and look stunning
dipping it in with Beach next to it is
everything now remember these new
shadows are very pigmented like all my
stuff so little goes a long way you
don't need to dig into the pan you don't
need to be aggressive just the lend away
all right we are looking like a
beautiful sunset right now I am so
stoked on this look yes the Met Gala is
quaking alright you guys so we're just
gonna put a little bit more taste buds
under the eye and then I'm also gonna
dip into kumquat and just give it a
little smokiness of course the girl the
lighting is rough right by the ocean

underneath here yeah that girl over here

products left to try out but I'm really
hungry and I know you guys are gonna
read me to filth like Jeffrey you're in

everyone that it tastes healthier than
America Oh much yeah exact shoe alrea
yeah different regulations here they
didn't have real chicken huh yeah they
do and the dessert menu here is a little
bigger they have these amazing Donuts
here that are just like how do you
explain them just the softness they're
like almost like Krispy Kreme just not
glazed with sugar yeah exactly
just the soft is like the fresh ones all
right cool well let's go grab a little
bite and then we'll dive back into these
products
all right oh man you all y'all better
watch it
are we doing a mukbang it looks like it
what did you get babe I should got a Big
Mac now when cars are this old they
don't have cup holders you guys so
you've got to use your in between your
legs yes you do
gotta use them kegels yes now you know I
just got a cheeseburger playing I don't
like condiments or sauces I know
everyone's like boring and I also take
off the top I'm just - that little
cheese right there mm-hmm I mean you
know you don't really need all that
mm-hmm
I sure don't delicious amen good old
comfort food exactly no matter where you
are in the world I've been everywhere
and there's always the McDonald's but I
actually got my assistant to eat
McDonald's yesterday for the first time
in seven years because they what was the
call it's like a vegan I make vegan
she's never had one I should never have
when she loved it oh yeah she was like
those taste healthier than America I'm
like it probably is girl
all right Nate just hopped out we had a
quick little bite I love having a lunch
date in the back of the car now we're
going to finish up these eyes we are
doing a very bright today so I think
we're going to take filthy-rich this
gorgeous metallic gold shade right here
we're just gonna dip right in and we're
gonna put this on my lid and try not to
poke my eye out while we're driving
yeah it's metallic now we're just gonna
pack that on and get ready for summer
yeah whoo the Sun was like on my lid as
I was pressing this in and loved that
yes honey showoff thirsty almost done
with the eyes everyone know I've been
doing this thing lately with yellow
we'll see if we want to do it today
let's give it a whirl where I just take
this little brush I've been doing this
for the past a week at all the signings
I just take the yellow and I pressed it
under and now this brush is a little big
usually I like to do a little more but
just take the yellow press it right
under the eye blend it with the orange
and it just creates a little like orange
lemonade oh it sounds really good of
course we're using shade quench for this
in the new palette it is a very vibrant
yellow so
a little goes a long way all right now
to finish off the eye I'm gonna try
these new fancy beauty Island bling
two-in-one
liquid eye shimmers hey what is this my
mamacita and tim-ki okay so let's see
what these look like
I've seen this online but never in
person ooh
okay so I don't even know what these are
supposed to do does it say on the box it
has to layer glitter top coat over dried
metallic color for a hyper prismatic 3d
effect or wear separately ooh okay now I
know that my shadow is really blinging
so I maybe have already up but
let's just put some glitter on top of
the glitter because high where it were
in a rolls-royce it's only fitting oh
wow this looks really prismatic okay so
we're just gonna take this we're gonna
press it right on top of this in the
center of the eye oh wow
and we looking at sunlight whoa when the
light hits this honey like okay
Oh Sparkle gets me off I'm like wow all
right y'all um and by the way since
we've started filming it's about a
thousand degrees outside I'm like
which we're sweating right we're gonna
turn out really quickly and I want to
show you guys how these Rihanna and
thirsty colors look together Wow I'm
like holy bananas look at the bling on
this face honey cartier is shaking okay
guys so now it's time to test some
mascara now I grabbed these the other
day in Norway and I was living for these
I've tried them yet but the packaging
looked cool their volume squeezable
mascaras and there's a coral and a pink
shade and I'm like let's shoot you the
pink or to do the coral let's do the
coral it's probably obnoxious so coral
pump oh okay now we all know doing
mascara in a moving vehicle can be
tricky so I think for the top ones we'll
do black and in the bottoms with the
coral so I'll pull out my iconic benefit
roller lash of course now this is the
part where you don't want to go blind
all right
top lashes are done now let's go over to
this bougie expensive mascara and let's
try the coral pump oh wow this brush is
massive okay bottom lashes lovely well
what what happens now I sort of cheese
colored mascara like I don't know in
like 1989 okay so let's see if the pump
has improved okay guys let's give us a
whirl and see if there's any pigment oh
wow okay shockingly there is au revoir
over some severe cobblestones y'all
might imagine this going in my eye
we're gonna get in really close to the
camera sorry if my skin looks crazy but
yeah look at that it coats the hair
coral this is crazy
imagine doing like a brown smokey eye
and you do the pink ooh whoa it's really
cool it's actually kind of subtle maybe
because the eyeshadows are so neon well
I'm kind of living for the look it
almost masks them and then when you look
close you're like oh good morning all
right so far so good all right you guys
let's do some lips because I am dying to
put on some lipstick all right now for
lips today we're gonna use a new velour
liquid lip shade called soft-serve it is
a very peachy nude and then we're gonna
put on some iridescent lip Luminizer x'
from breanna there's a shade in here at
this middle one it looks like a peachy
coral ice cream moment we definitely
need her so let's pop this bitch open
this is shade bilingual I love that
let's put on soft-serve first and then
we'll put that on top all right stop
serve is now dried on the lips now let's
take out bilingual oh this looks so
pretty in here and oh my god he smells
so yummy
come on like great cupcake eat creme
brulee all right let's see what these
look like on the mouth oh wow
that color is stunning all right so I
think the final step before we go
Salette so we definitely need to keep
this makeup on holiday at night so we're
gonna pull out our Urban Decay all
nighter I know it's not anything new but
it is my all-time favorite settings
spray so we don't want to give us a look
at the card let's be careful
all right this face is done now while
we're driving back to go pick up
everyone let's just do a little recap of
all these products and let's see what I
am living for what I'm not living for
and let's just do our final thoughts all
right I know that I just used it so I'm
like okay already obsessed but these are
really really pretty
I've seen a few people use these shades
and they look stunning can't wait to try
more of these out so we will definitely
be bringing her on the road with us
thank you trio and for the price I think
it's pretty good for these now the
setting powder that I just used the Marc
Jacobs it's actually pretty good
obviously I have a shadow over some of
my concealer but it looks pretty there's
a whole orchestra Chris look
all right obviously I'm not gonna judge
my own products my you know I stand by
them a hundred percent so thirsty palate
what's up June 16th the wet and wild
blush was actually really pretty I know
I covered it up with the Fendi stuff but
overall I'm gonna shock because I'm
sitting there like I hate any product
that I used today I'm kind of like shook
about it usually you know I have to run
my mouth about something but overall I
think the only thing that is of course
sitting a little weird with me was the
Sicily bronzer for $85 it was literally
like a basic bronzer let's be honest
with each other I love that brand they
have some of the best skin care but it
is bougie girl and this bronzer was not
life-changing the compact although cheap
I wish they would have went more heavy
and luxurious like this feels better
than this girl and I love this packaging
besides that I think the coral mascara
it wasn't the best thing on earth now
that's dried I think I picked the wrong
color I should have went with like a
purple or a pink so that was my mistake
I think I picked the color that was too
safe because it literally blended in
with bitch kumquat and taste buds from
my palette so I up there and
should have got a different color now my
skin it is very hot out maybe I should
have used a mattifying primer as well
but overall I love this lemare
foundation I know it's so pricey so I
don't want to tell you guys it's like
the best thing ever
but if you like lifelike skin it is
pretty bomb but there are of course
cheaper alternatives
let's be really real with each other
here besides that I kind of lived for
everything I know that's shocking I know
there's a few oh gee favorites in here
of course we use the OG concealer that
I've been loving something that I forgot
to use was a lip scrub duh I use these
last night so my lips were already
prepped and ready
but the grape soda the lower lip scrub
from my brand is so good I mean I think
they're all yummy of course these are
edible and infused with vitamin E if
you've never tried one they're only $12
on my website girl shameless plug
alright you guys I cannot believe that
this video is done we are pulling up to
my hotel right now I have had the most
magical time here in Finland in Norway I
love Scandinavia so much I know Sweden
and Denmark we didn't get to see this
trip but we will be back very
soon very very soon so of course state
track up all my social media to find out
the Realty but now I'm gonna go
celebrate with the jeffree star
cosmetics team and just have an amazing
day and enjoy all the hard work that
we've been putting on so of course sound
