channel today we are going to be diving
into some a luxury item from the brand
Javon shape Beauty which I haven't
really used a lot of stuff on my channel
before it is of course a high-end brand
I love you on sheet fashion I love their
clothing their shoes their sunglasses so
today we're going to be talking about
some new items that Javon she just
dropped now they have a beauty line and
a while ago which is weird because I was
just thinking here like okay we're going
to try out some steps today but I bought
this primer from them it's called mr.
mat so I thought it would be a good idea
to bust this out and try it with their
foundation I'm sure that would probably
be the best bet first of all we are
going to talk about their new Beauty
sponge it is a spiked Beauty sponge and
it looks something like this oh my god
why does this look like like a deadly
weapon and I'm kind of obsessed with it
so this is soaked with water already I
do have another one here so it comes in
a box that looks something like this now
these retail for $20 I think that's
pretty fair Beauty blenders are I think
around the same price now you guys know
on my channel I always do wet Beauty
blenders with setting powder and it just
looks amazing so I may try this wet I
don't know it does look like this when
it is dry so it does double inside now I
am going to go on Sephora calm which is
where I found this so basically you guys
this is a multi-use sponge applicator
for smooth even coverage we'll see about
that a second and it says that this can
be used damp with fluid foundations or
dry with a compact a new double cone
shape ensures quick and precise
application while it's central strip
keeps fingers clean now when I read that
I was like thank you Lord now you guys
know I'm a Beauty Blender whore but I
got to say this when I am gripping a
Beauty Blender and the foundation gets
all over my nails it is annoying because
then after going with the makeup wipe
and wipe it all off or have to wash my
hand and it does get a little bit of you
know a little bit annoying it's a little
bit of annoying annoying annoying
I'm annoyed ok that's what's happening
now the texture compared to this is very
similar now today we're also going to be
testing out their brand new foundation
it comes in a unit carton that looks
like this
and this is oh my god you guys know I'm
gonna pronounce it wrong I pronounce
everything but I don't want to say wrong
how about we zoom in on that word
everybody might ISA me mateesah mom Matt
oh my god this brain is just slapped me
across my mouth at the river watching
this basically this is a new matte
velvet foundation and I'm gonna tell you
guys and thanks about it so this
foundation comes at a whopping $54 which
the but that bad compared to a lot of my
favorite foundation flexi-bottle
looks something like this it has this
beautiful little kind of like studded
detailing right there with the shiny
black packaging this is glass so of
course I know you guys cannot feel heavy
this is through those bones or the
computers but it feels nice also has SPF
20 in it which is always nice y'all know
I'm not trying to edge this foundation
was inspired by the feel and comfort of
velvet that's straight from the runway I
love that it is sheer to medium coverage
now it is for a normal and combination
skin only well that's what it says on
Sephora calm obviously I'm sure the
brand provided that information so
basically you guys this is going to give
your complexion and instantly
long-lasting hold while keeping your
skin balance and allow you to breathe
dual mattifying technology instantly
imparts a matte effect the airy
structure of silica microspheres
optimizes the absorption of excess
moisture while allowing the skin to
breathe oh my god ok scientists how do
you do that and basically it says that
it's going to give my skin and lasting
matte effect while a botanical trio
targets oily areas without drawing out
the normal and dry areas of the skin
jesus take the wheel so basically this
is a badass foundation allegedly and we
are about to test out these today also
they have a bronzer that they just put
out and we'll talk about that later but
let's get our engines ready and let's do
a first impression alright I'm going to
go in with their mister matte primer
let's see what this looks like I'm
oh whoa it's like it almost feels like
the benefit Porefessional like almost
identical actually oh okay it has more
of a strong floral scent the one like
benefit is definitely like no fragrance
which I kind of prefer if it's not a
jammy scent I'm not into it and a video
a few days ago I said but I didn't love
fragrances but I like fragrances and so
many of you were trying to read me down
I simply met I don't like really strong
fragrances and makeup but if it's a
pleasant scent like sugar or anything
sweet I'm into which it's not
overpowering okay so it definitely
modified my face my pores look a little
more flat did they cover them up
completely and blurred no which did not
fit was supposed to blur it definitely
did not but it didn't matter if I my
skin which I expected to do and I guess
it did the job okay I'm gonna let that
settle for a second and let's try a
foundation I think I'm going to go in
with zero for matte beige the number
three was a little light for me which
I'm shocked because I was at a last
ditch so it says on the side of the
bottle to shake well before use so we're
going to shake her up right now all
right all right okay so with the pump of
course is a standard pump like this now
when I tweeted and said that I was going
to review this a lot of you were excited
and said yes please do it now you also
said that this looks like the maybelline
superstay better skin foundation and
actually have that and I pulled that out
of my ass earlier I haven't used in
months but it kind of looks similar huh
no tea no shade just kind of similar
bottles and pumps but I'm okay so we
have our wet sponge it is ready to go
I'm just going to put out a few pumps on
the blender like that I like the
daughter around my face so let's do that
and then we're going to blend it
okay good now I'm a full-coverage queen
and this of course did say shear to
medium coverage and it's definitely that
like a Mardi list I want a little bit
more coverage
I'm are you judging okay now I'm going
to maybe flip it and just kind of go in
oh yeah this is really good for like
right here a lot easier than using my
nails and the tip of the other sponge
okay so I'm looking at a monitor and for
some reason I'm looking a little patchy
which is very bizarre with a beauty
sponge now here's the thing does the
primer work well with the foundation I
don't know it's obviously from the same
brand so I'm going to assume but
sometimes you guys formulas do not mix
well with primer so I'm not blaming the
primary yet but it is a little streaky
and it could be just Bunge maybe it's
not applying as well as I wanted to it's
funny because I said the material is
very so much the Beauty Blender but the
Beauty Blender just feels more soft
while it's buffing almost the shape I
don't know I'm Michael I'm a little
conflicted right now I'll be honest
let's get her to a medium because right
now it is very sheer so I'm going to
take it on this side now and let's do
one we'll do one pump
and let's use this item if you happen
all eyes on me
okay now I'm looking and the maunder and
I'm looking in a mirror it is Falacci
like are you guys seeing what I'm seeing
this is such a trip I'm going to take a
our teeth brush and see if it will like
fix any of it I want to show a little
close-up of like this area on my face
because I obviously just blend it out
the forehead but this it's almost like
kind of spotty let's kind of coagulate
right there a little bit right here now
I'm going to take this brush and blend
up and out and see if it will smooth it
out a little more okay everybody I think
this brush definitely helps fill this
room applying makeup literally every day
for so long I'm sitting here and I'm
like okay I'm like I know how to
troubleshoot makeup I know I think I
know what's going on so I think the
sponge is not great
I'm just for me it may be amazing for
other people but the material and the
way it goes on the waist angles it's
like hard to like I don't know it's like
a thinner spot it's not like bigger work
it's getting a larger portion of my face
I felt like the foundation was drying
quickly and this was not helping move it
around it was almost like stamping it
around instead of making it like look
airbrushed and beautiful now the
foundation itself I think is actually
pretty now the primer who knows with a
bustah primer did to the foundation but
the cementation itself is really pretty
yes it's very sheer we did build it up
but as you can see no I do have a little
bit of discoloration and it barely
covered it but it's very natural and I
know a lot of people out there love
natural foundation you know I'm not one
of them but I'm down to try them all out
now I do want to put on some concealer
and powder and see how the foundation
looks now I think it's only fair that we
use this of course because that's why
we're here so today for concealer I'm
going to be going in with the chart
shaped case now I know how this looks on
me I've been using it for a month now so
we are going to just dot this all over
where I would normally put it all righty
now let's bust our out again
and let's pop out and do happen okay
okay let's zoom in here because this I
think is what up the foundation
so I took the tip just like they said I
went in and it just does not want to
blend like amazing
oh yeah it's like almost just moving it
around and not making it look flawless I
guess that's what I have to say about
that whoever's been watching my channel
for a while or even a few videos you
know how my concealer blends out like
 butter this is rough oh my god
it took a little dry under my eyes now
too
well I am going to quickly buff this out
with this because I am shook
right now
there we go now let's show the
difference between this side which in my
opinion because I'm staring at myself
five inches away it looks smooth
flawless and beautiful and then let's go
over here where it's just not happening
there's less coverage it's tricky
there's like concealer that's pulled
from right here there's like a dry patch
I'm like what the man I'm like not
used to seeing that result so I'm a
little shocked right now I'm just going
to keep it really awesome on 100 as
usual okay I think it's only fair that
we take some under eye setting powder
like we would normally do we'll take the
Chanel one of my all-time favorites
we'll use this guy again and we're just
going to dip in like I normally would
and it will see how it works under the
eyes I mean it's loose powder right
can't really mess that up alright guys
so I quickly did a little bit of more
setting on my face and I put powder
foundation today I use the Chanel double
perfection lumineer powder foundation I
love this one I've been using for a long
time now on and off I'm going to give
you my first impressions on the sponge
of course I'm going to wear the
foundation for about six hours and come
back in a little bit but I'm going to
say this to guys the rest of that I love
this brand and I hate doing this but
girl that sponge is awful
I knew it I should just stay to my
tried-and-true Beauty Blender but I saw
the packaging packaging lures you in it
really does it looked amazing I love the
shape I love how it looks it just didn't
work I think it was a material and maybe
the shape should have been a little
bigger but it was wet I did not love it
sadly so sadly the blender is not jelly
jar approved the foundation so far is
looking good pretty but I also wanted to
do a little mini review snake this in
here Jevon she also put out a new floral
edition of their healthy glow powder it
comes in a giant compact like this y'all
know I like giant things big things tall
things that luscious juicy things no I'm
not talking about Nathan's ball sack but
today we are going to try this out let's
open her up whoo
I love
and that have decorations and I love the
imprint in the powder I love that type
of stuff and this looks stunning this
bronzer is a whopping $65 so it's even
more than the foundation good lord so
we're going to test this out y'all I'm
gonna put on my face now I'm real not a
bronzy person obviously you guys know
I'm a model into that lately I have been
into the more sunkissed look I'm trying
new things now this is a healthy glow
and body bronzing powder it is supposed
to be weightless for a healthy looking
appearance featuring a pattern design
with a cemetry flow impression yes I see
it and I'm obsessed with it it also says
that it is a cal curry powder that lets
your skin show off its best light
year-round while always looking fresh
and radiant formulated with innovative
technology it is what is it's a goal
it's supposed to reinvent the nude
makeup look thanks to a formula that
provides color without texture which I
love that because some highlighters and
some bronzers mature for it stand out
and not cute
so I figured we were going with this
little Marc Jacobs little big Marc
Jacobs bronzer brush I don't want to
ruin it I'm after buy another one okay
we're going in no for a transcript might
like to smell everything okay so I don't
really do this type of thing I know I
see people that just cover themselves a
bronzer I'm just going to go in on
myself let's see what happens now I will
say this when I saw the color in the pan
I was like a little warm tone for me
it's a little orange but when it's on
the skin right now not like severe her
not really a play on color flowers don't
really get messed up right away which
means it's not like you know you're not
going to go through it in a few weeks
it's definitely definitely doing the job
I think the foundation got a little
patchy up here I mean it let's keep it
real with each other okay it's a little
bit cheap now that is very uncommon on
this channel I'm sorry to say but yeah
it's a little patchy up here so the
bronzer might look a little weird on top
of it I think you reason why as i was
expect--
to be really orange and wild and it's
not it's really pretty
it is definitely shear which I like in a
bronzer because I don't want something
that is like willy intense where all of
a sudden your face looks like you just
threw mud on top of it okay guys I think
I am going to finish my makeup and I'm
going to go to the office I'm going to
go run some errands and yeah I'm gonna
be back way later in the day you guys
are gonna be watching from the same
video but I'll be back later tonight
alright y'all look at me imagine like a
72 moment
mm okay so basically heavy glasses hook
up the nose
so anyway final thoughts it's been about
one week my phone oh my god late today
and it's been about six hours and 25
minutes actually to be exact and I'm
going to give you my final thoughts on
all three products let's start with the
makeup sponge I picked it up off the
floor and I said I'm sorry bitch I might
do you this one definitely busted up my
foundation it did not blend out the
concealer amazing I don't know why I am
just going to guess from someone who has
used so many sponges that the material
of the sponge was not it this surface
needs to be wider it just did not
distribute the product good enough for
me definitely made it patchy when your
boyfriend can notice that your makeup is
different on one side we have some
problems when he says toe the blender
next all right so the foundation is
actually it surprises me throughout the
day it really did not move it's subtle
it's cute it's very like like fresh
looking I guess is a really the right
word it's youthful it did not crack or
get weird which is shocking I touched up
my t-zone probably that literally once
today in the car in traffic yeah this
auditions were really pretty I think for
the price there are definitely some
drugstore options that you can find that
it's similar but if you're someone that
loves a luxury items and you love a
pretty matte look this foundation is
definitely a candidate for you so the
Givenchy matte foundation is Jeffrey
star approve yeah
now let's move on to that bronzer I
think that the bronzer was really pretty
I'm excited to use it take it on some
trips keep my glow I definitely can't
wait to try it when my foundation is not
so patchy and it's put on correctly I
don't know I'm not really into the more
matte primaries I like fresh more I mean
I don't know I think this may have been
an issue with the foundation as well not
sure I'm going to try the foundation at
and further date this week without this
and without the blender and I will give
you some feedback below the little
update so the bronzer the bronze
reference are approved I loved it it was
really pretty and went on great the
formula was nice and blended very pretty
sometimes am I going to say pretty
before is your grade and I left it so
cool to let it two hundred three eight
back y'all two out of three not bad let
me know you guys saw us on how the
foundation looks on my skin let me know
what you thought of the blender close-up
in that for K baby and I will see you
guys on the next video thank you so much
for watching my love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
