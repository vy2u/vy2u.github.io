crazy ABS highlighters we have the most
luxurious brand that we have found

price highlighter that I'm like girl

highlighters allegedly so we're just
going to dive in and of course we have
Laura Lee in the building yeah Laura

shameless plug if you want to see us
test out some crazy mother fucking
highlighters and keep on watching
alright so Laura we're gonna let's start
with the most expensive ones over here
for I'm in out all of it alright so this
is the love Mayer the illuminating
powder now I will say that's about
lemare it is one of my favorite skincare
brands it is one of my favorite
foundation formulas look at that model
sometimes already now that's some of the
most amazing products on the market but
this guy what's the retail for her this
is one hundred and thirty dollars I'm
sure it fucking is and it's been lured
from one highlighter but let me be
honest before we even unbox it it's
heavy bitch it is hats V so let's see
here there's no instruction great great
okay so comes this gorgeous unit car in
it looks something like that oh my gosh
and a pouch hello okay so it comes in
this beautiful luxurious like felt
packaging and the highlighter so whoa
wait open look are
so something else is in there okay so it
looks something like this it's beautiful
packaging what is that bright little
brat thank you okay let's open her up
I've never seen this before oh oh whoa
it's like this crazy it was like a color
corrector so it has like lavender orange
and violet light color corrector little
triangles in there and for this price I
will say that quartz lemare's of
bougie-ass brain you're going to pay for
the name everything today you're paying
for the name as well as the formula okay
so this is on the mirror little plastic
protector great get off of me not touch
weird it fall right in your crotch what
is probably to say that it's supposed to
do real American sub booklet with the
health of booklet this is a lightweight
shimmering pressed powder infused with
illuminating gemstones brilliant pearls
and color two pigments that provide all
complexions with the healthy luminous
glow that's a big thing people like
sometimes people read me to filter like
not using the brush that it comes with
so whoever uses the brush it comes with
that's literally a basic ass like I mean
I don't like how it would even probably
distribute the powder right so we're
gonna we have a bunch of highlighter
brushes today let's just pick up yeah
here
uh-huh here we go same one what is the
more get you in the market I'm back ten
oh Ken okay so we're going to both dive
in here we'll hit first of all the
tickets on campus so that I'm actually
yeah so pretty
looks a little doll I'm just gonna
Cantrell looks like a little purple tire
brush okay so let me scroll it around
let's try on our right cheekbone alright
it's pretty look at that I'm going to go
ahead and say it's not $130 pretty oh
you're already jumping right okay she's
diving in let me get a little more
it definitely monopsony to it yeah for
sure but it's not like that banging
highlight but you're not blinding you
wouldn't you know most of you watching
are going to be like okay if it's $130 I
better pay my car insurance and a better
to my cheeks about any blinding agree
layer three I'm taking a higher to my
hairline so if you're a supernatural
girl like the light highlight you might
like this I mean I don't know about
hundred dollars oh yeah if you're a
bougie ass bitch that likes a subtle
blow and maybe you're on the road
outside with
we might want this you might want this
but um ok I'm gonna hop that's about it
love the compact though that everybody
looks so gorgeous I almost wish it was
bigger too like yeah like the dork
mm-hmm it's a little small
yeah okay great all right the next
highlighter we're about to try out why
have you just one so I mean it's not
really cheating Laura's never even
spoken seen it before so this is the new
Tom Ford I think in that shear
highlighting duo and it's in the shade
of reflex guilts which I love that name
so it comes in a gorgeous combat it's a
little more lightweight than evil
America for sure felt super lightly

looks something like this that looks so
pretty now I will say this I love a
metallic I use this in a tutorial once
and I took it to London a few weeks ago

things cuz I have some highlighting
problems myself with this one retails
for how much this one is $78
Jesus HIV crazy description cheek eyes
in a reflex guilts a pair of shinning
roses those cut boring
yeah let's doing any boring out it's
going to give a light reflecting at
finish to bronze glowing and skin
impersonal cheek and face highlighter
okay applied wet for a soft wait what
the shades can be applied wet for a soft
veil of color or dry for a sweeping pop
when it's wet wouldn't it be more
intense I mean that's how normal things
work but so what is this thing a soft
fill color that's interesting okay what
I'm really cool maybe you try it dry and
I'll just wet my brush perfect and let's
see if they're lying or not if you dip

shear products on the market this is not

some of the stuff on my channel before
it's very hit-or-miss
just like a lot of luxury I mean that's
like when a fashion brand makes makeup
it's never like amazing yeah some good
some bad
so let's talk about this product
allegedly this is a lightweight
illuminating powder with an intricate
lace pattern Thank You Lourdes of that
so what it does it is supposed to give
you Burberry glow a luminous shade uses
flattering subtle highlighting with a
runway inspired yet effortless strobe

features are defined we're sweeping the
pearly trend Lucent powder across the
areas of your face where light would

body with that okay Nexus V be your skin
nude air Luminizer this is zero zero one
okay there's four shades and this is a
whopping $56 whether it feels pretty
okay looks binding in the penetration
now this is a highlighting part with a
highly concentrated formula with
illuminating pigment so it's going to
give you in Oh
so this is what it's virtually in
perceptible texture your skin drama
reveals glowing skin for a readily
luminous complexion it also the same
shades but the goal okay where should we
put this I want to put it right here huh
woo olive um yeah okay and then you do
your nose and keep it so amazing the

they love okay cool let's try the nose
and cheeks let's see what see you for it
Oh oh yeah that's pretty
holy I'm looking to hire bones work I
want it right over my talking lipgloss
ready for this yeah that's pretty I
would say the Burberry's more intense
okay let me try some where they can
actually see I'll do the tip of my nose

blinding yeah but this is really pretty
for someone that likes to be glowy but
not like oh my god screaming in your
face yeah I think this is perfect
not obsessed but I do love it I love

shimmering skin Perfector pressed
prismatic MSS now the box is really like
hollow sexual I am living for that so

hopefully the powder looks the same I'm
going to scream so this is a lavender
duochrome highlighter is what the
website says that's how do you unbox her
now this says like a spotlight for your
skin this will light up your favorite
features with a high impact ultra
reflective shine that's a bold statement
it says inspired by the dazzling light
of the midday Sun this iconic formula is
enriched with ultra fine luminescent
pearls that absorb reflect and reflect
light so amplify your natural radiance

lids and like I'm counting in a room
meet you okay let me see you first go
ahead oh nothing white maldor honestly
kinda so talking it was like chalk it
has a little bit of pearl essence but I
wouldn't say duochrome I think can let
me try it on my eyelid ready for this is
emotional Amell everywhere to put it you
guys let me try it right here I'm
reaching wow it's a lot of weight shit
okay I'm gonna hurt my collarbone
because I don't think my leg is a fair
statement put on a brand honesty right
over grandma
okay ready for this one or they look
like it looks kind of cool it kind of
looks like iridescent not super strong I
only see on the monitor how is it in
person honestly no a little powdery just
being dead honest like you can see
flecks of like actual pounders that I'm
melting into your skin if you can I'm
saying like you see like oh wow you look
like your dry elbow oh great I'm not
selling this Geoffrey it's not doing
Carlton yeah I don't this looks like a
white powder on me okay in my opinion
maybe a pink powder I don't know it
looks like talisman Oksana and I'm not
living for this I love you know I love
Bek I love the packaging I live for
their highlighter for a long time agree
um lately
it's barely shifting I wouldn't say
duochrome up a reach right there we are
reaching um okay all right let's do our
final stop listen we had five crazy
moments here I'm gonna say it for us
Burberry is the way easily a win now the
two that were like mediocre so these
were a horrible yeah but they weren't
the best on earth but they're pretty
good yeah they were like they were
blinding
they were cool this will no share my app
no there is no action is completely
wrong on that friends it was but is the
first highlighter that I've ever used
wet that was left blind yeah let's ping
to blame than the drying yeah
weird now the one that's also flat I
mean what mayor I fucking win for you
but 130 left side you've got a lot
selling up to at that price and it just
didn't do it for me I didn't do it for
me at all so this one sadly love the
packaging formula and then I need Becca
prism prismatic and I just felt like
especially for my skin tone it will like
pink powder on my face
yes I'm not looking for it my collarbone
kind of flops I live for the unit
curtain like I got the package any
packaging sec but the powder was not
living for it like the other formulas
are more creamy yeah very like : my own
is like a for sure big butter for sure
so I don't know what happened here not
living for it but I can't wait to see
what they put out next but um yeah so
Burberry one you guys yeah now the
beauty world keeps putting out so many
crazy highlighters like I took every few
weeks there's like something coming up
