channel we brought low early bad ok I'm
going to read everyone at home because
here's a drill if you don't like
someone's accent at the broad showing
how they talk don't bug it watch the
video watch me you have a problem with
southern accents or my friend go to
another channel that's right I'd hate to
start a video off like that cuz i
normally go but we gotta keep it hot
people girl i try it so a few weeks ago
me and Laura reviewed the crazy viral
unicorn oil it was basically a scam and
I know the owner
the owner of that brand got so angry
sorry that we kept it real but you're
the ones scamming everyone and not me so
there's that but a lot of people like to
talk about your southern accent I don't
this is time your time it's just the way
I talk
I've lived in Alabama for 25 years what
do you want me to do I don't know now
look like a woman and have a deep voice
so the guy does something doesn't sound
like you doesn't mean it's not right
there's a whole world out there Sharon
so if you want to watch this
review and hear both of our voices and
you can continue to watch John that's
right it's not pause the video jack off
and then come back but or put up a mute
and jack off okay
and enjoy alright so today we're going
to be reviewing the crazy viral
lemonhead space hey you look crazy these
look so pretty well they look amazing
already you haven't even tried them but
I can't wait
so this brand is called the lemon head
they are I would say an indie brands
they are very new all these products are
handmade in Los Angeles amazing I think
that's really cool now a lot of the
videos I've seen going viral are this
like crazy cake icing type of thing
again with plastic cake frosting things
where you squeeze it and it comes out
the applicator okay your call videos of
employment in the jar yeah
I was like repeat repeat repeat like
addicted yeah anything shining so
satisfying to watch I'm gonna do it
well so of course you guys know we had
to test these out I'm just really
excited to dunk our whole lives in
glitter
definitely I want to bathe we do okay so
we have a lot of colors you guys I
ordered most of the colors on the site
they did come in a cute little black box
come on with a little lemon colored
tissue paper I love that
now remember this is an indie brand so I
saw the price tag it is $22 a piece yeah
I don't think that's that outrage oh now
it's not a crazy price point but they
are small but I mean some on their
website and I'm just going to give you
guys all the tea
okay so space pace is trademark so no
one can use it of that okay I love a
brand that knows what they want now this
is a full-coverage ultra thick glitter
paste designed for artists use on face
and body infused with the magic
essential oils giving a very faint lemon
scent and good lovin smell means I can't
open what I'm ladies like they won't
even read anymore other let's see what
we've got going on behind lemon oh is
that interesting it's faint yes they
okay I reviewed a few things that are
really lemony I'm on my channel that I
hate it this isn't like horrible I
doesn't really it sounds like a soft
candle it's refreshing like inside you
get the taste of course so I love the
glass component you don't expect any
it's a real heavy has a little pumping
screw on Kathlyn and has a logo which
means gesture we're trying to figure out
exactly what the logo is we'll say pizza
artwork okay listen we're going to zoom
in on this logo I cannot I bet you want
one thing like tell us what this is
we're gonna take all that our brains are
gonna click but I tell me we're not
crazy I get it out what is it I just
worry guard I see it just hit me ready
for it now I'm not kidding guys ten
minutes before we started filming this
we couldn't figure it out I'm going to
show you it this is the lemon okay okay
see that right there
some squeezing goodnight baby I'm not a
theory it's not much nail polish on it
it's right wheezing and something's
coming out you guys are going to sell it
at home and hopefully the brand will let
us know I'm going to actually tweet them
later and say what the hell is oh okay
so basically it's vegan
it's cruelty free and it's sourced
locally whenever possible
okay ago with that wording though I
don't know about like that worrying
whenever possible and when it's not
possible we're sorting out its name okay
it is handmade in Los Angeles we said
which i think is cool yeah a lot of the
shade names are very Los Angeles like no
verily we have Silver Lake which is a
city in Los Angeles waving Mulholland
which is a street here in LA yes okay so
basically this is best applied by hand
or synthetic brush in a streak motion
don't go diggin blended it in no pro tip
after it dries down shape what they
Scooby or sponge to achieve clean line
okay oh okay so you can manipulate the
product I think so well obviously we're
going to test that out now a removal it
says rub off with a dry sponge rinse
with water or use like an oil cleanser
if layered what it says don't use a
makeup wipe no I want to want to make it
white does to any like spreads it
everywhere and we're not doing the whole
face blur challenge again that I want to
do for a month
I think glitter in my back listen there
was a litter on these tainted yeah face
paste contains a 100% cosmetic polyester
glitter which the FDA does not approve
for use on or near the eyes okay so okay
I was I was like all Asia with this
product is intended for professional
artists reuse and should be used safely
and responsibly keep away from children
okay cool now it also has 0.5 balances
in the product which I think that's
pretty good for glitter yeah
now you guys on the website what it was
really to use it on our eyes which I'm
not going to hate on because I've used
glitter from the craft store remember
yeah
and nothing's really happened they just
have to pay the excess da yes and you
also want to be careful because I've
known a few people that have had like
cuts on their eye or pointy here they
were rubbing not you to take your
mouthpiece yeah now also I got a few of
D I'm going to call this body glitter I
guess this is called Space Jam it's in a
way bigger pot and there's only a few
shades in that I maybe have to end I
think this is more fluid maybe the hair
or on really so this fixes it is your
party vibe if you want to it is a super
packed combination of confetti we're
hopeful and stars blended into a base
few of just color so that one says it's
basically a base hue of Barbie
convertible pink and prismatic silver oh
okay okay so I think what I've been
dying to do is since I've seen these is
both start and put on me but I'm Chinese
we have to we're tall I know which one
are you should we both do the same one
yeah maybe
okay so we're going to dip into these
and I'm gonna be using silver leg we're
not excited an adult film okay I'm
kidding
oh I paste it oh it's big it's big honey
just look at that I am okay so how
should I do this like that guy I don't
know
yeah with cooling whoa okay it's like
okay look at that look on camera holding
is so dope
oh it's very cold Emily okay we're going
in we're going in so cool already huh
okay now we're gonna blend it and move
it around
hi Shh I live with this right now look
at Pinterest photo honestly and it's me
and less than a second like just got out
of then and honestly it doesn't feel
like heavy on my cheek it doesn't it
also is really like a wave okay so they
said to let it dry for a minute and then
try to fully I think yours is like
insane I took the like the lightest one
that looks so I was not being really
to you it looks out the Sun DeGeorge
goes dry or any no use a clean finger no
I'm wet
okay so we're going to drive right
second okay cool mom oh my god this is
exciting
okay before we try any more we're going
to let this dry and then we're going to
play it this bully and then we'll
continue on and you're back alright so
it's been about ten minutes and how does
your mind feels like it feels dry does
it feel tight the nose dry it's still
lightweight I'm pressing hard nothing
like one one little dot actually I have
a little bit of fallout absolutely but
mine's on like caked on yeah okay so it
says try spoolie I think you should try
this bullying first mine's already like
I think cuz mine was more like sheer
see-through all right so it says just to
use a spoolie and shape it around cuz
features moves at all oh no I feel like
it just kind of comes up okay so this
said after dry down which means when
it's completely dry I'm going to assume
right as a dry down mean right it's just
coming off on so it says on the website
to move it around at the dry down I
would probably do it while it was still
wet yeah
honestly that it would move around
perfect so it's intense that's a
little bit a lot Laura I went in you
gave me glitter right in okay I think
it's only fair that we try something I
want to put them on my eyes even though
you're not supposed to yeah you don't
have dying to put on Laura you guys this
shade that is everything
gun show I want him to like spackle some
of this on my eyelids yes
and then Roosevelt I'm super into me
what are the move over it's so fine I'm
different
okay fine Denis let's open it to open up
that one the glitter looks more like
chunky and this one is like really fine
fine glitter when we're just gonna use a
little Mac synthetic brush hi Mac PS I'm
going to just say it for you Laura Lee
is doing a collaboration Mac on Mac I'll
probably placement this made me think
about it so it comes out on a 20 or 20
yes that's right alright listen about
that day
I can't wait to wear it yeah what's your
shade called
it is called Marley yes so cute and it
is such a pretty brown nude you guys

would still wear it because I'm obsessed
with nude um anyway back to your eye but
I can't wait for it thank you excited

okay look down and I'm gonna go tell me
how it feels when I put on whoa
feels like wet glue kinda is it it looks
crazy

high out girl won't watch me use this
thick brush and try this other shade on
myself look at dirty penny the cool
copper bottom look at that mmm
let's just see what this looks like oh
wow okay there we go
I mean like it's intense segment and I
think it's pretty buildable like and a
little goes a long way like it's like I
could have this jar for a long time oh
sure I was so pretty I'm a kind of
effortless it was like we picked a
really dark one for you but I don't even
care it shows off how stunning it is I
loved it - I do - should we do another
color to be yeah weird yeah okay great
absolute lack and gold let's do it okay
cool so this is this is Gilda Beast wow
they look so pretty
there's already some on the cap which
I'm gonna use I'm going in oh listen you
might have to steal this from me yeah
you're not gonna let me keep it at my
own no ma'am oh it looks wet but it's
not it doesn't even feel like anything
like this oh my god
I've never seen that much intense litter
and I just put it right in here we're
like similar like you said eyes how cool
okay little it yeah I'm in a corner
right
I mean oh wow just a little more naming
tickly mean like very minimal just like
oh my god that so intense
yeah I was pretty that's all you mean
said I barely touched her I you guys
like you filled in my light let's try to
now yeah yeah it told super comfortable
doesn't so good if you like that gluey
crappy no like stick and your lives are
like yeah no not at all it's super
comfortable whoa well okay Laura's my
glitter experimentation right now I'm
going to take this shithole to Roosevelt
this has a more fine red glitter in it
oh one just try it pat on your mouth
literally scream Santa Claus is cool I
get my finger yeah so she just took off
some lip gloss and then she might be
wearing this new little color cold I'm
sure that just came out that collab is
zero okay so the glitter is finer
definitely fun mine I'll wing it is
super pretty on the lip yeah it feels
gritty but not like you would think I
got it bad yeah it's not as blingy of
the eye of the cheeks I'm not obsessed
with like the fine fine glitter no media
all right now these big ones are
supposedly for Izzy hair and body yeah
so I think we should grab a synthetic
brush a and she's working your hair I
think we should choose that's what I'm
most excited about now
what color you think ah whatever you
think that's cool oh okay this one is
called see pop okay Oh looks like do
honed or something that does look a
little kind of look whoa oh it looks
like every Pinterest photo I've ever
seen worried about with the brush oh no

hold on hold on one day in my life
