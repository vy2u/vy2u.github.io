Channel today I have a morally in their
browser hey hey okay so today what the
hell we getting a girl today we have
something new fresh it's gone viral
somewhat my pap smear results
we're reviewing it I know we really are
but that's weather here is Blanche I'm
sorry guys we have to giggles because we
just work stuff with highlighting if you
didn't know me and Lauren have reviewed
so many highlighters last year like
whatever yes every fucking eyeliner
highlighter the N we went in so close
the picture so this meme and this
product has been going to viral all over
Instagram all over Pinterest I've seen
it everywhere and basically we saw what
it's like a little oil bottle yes it's
like a little violet called a uniform
oil it looks pink and it's OCD alert
just pinged it beautiful how I just
showing the picture that okay no been
advertised again this picture has been
going viral everywhere so I journalist
from the company right someone made it
we really couldn't research it and so
the brand is called glow cult cosmetics
and today we have some products to
review a little King a little first
impression so we have all three of the
illuminating glow elixir I love Emily
Heather do me the do me oh I could do
you we're gonna ask our husband tonight
no wedding ring yet okay so this is the
rose water priming and setting man with
I guess glitter in it allegedly so we're
looking up this brand on Instagram
called cosmetics
there's no Instagram account for it it's
gone yeah I think it's blocked or gone
forever have tagged them before in the
past
and then the Instagram is gone so I
don't know why that's kind of weird it's
so weird but they do have a website and
that's where I bought these products
from so a little info about this product
you guys there's a little weird though
because there is no logo or any branding
on the black bell websites not on the
bottle
I was even trying to look up the website
and I couldn't find it anywhere and when
it came in the package it didn't come in
a unit carton so there was no branding
info there was no ingredient list it's
just like sitting in there yeah no
ingredient list yeah now there is
ingredients on the website thank God
because I was being a little iffy play I
put this on my face what is the liner
it's good little crazy so these are it
basically there once you get you guys
the product is like sitting at the
bottom if we can show that was a little
bit shook because as what it looks like
on the website you like it clear on the
website it is like blinding glitter in a
bottle at the bottom so you have to
shake these up which it does on the site
so fucking negative for me that first of
it what's that tell ya going on here my
girl do I get a bad one exactly so
basically you're supposed to shake these
really well which will just shake them
all
more than Shea right yeah so this
product so that is a glistening
moisturiser perfect for use on bare skin
and give a nice foundation on yes but
also says it as an illuminating effect
to your foundation so to be added in see
like you know like a cover FX mango and
then you can't put it on top of makeup
like guess but there's people saying
they use like a bomb highlighter and
then they put it over over the bomb over
bomb now that's a little weird for me
exchange so it says this illuminating
pigment oil as the perfect amount of
glow and warmth to your face while
lightly moisturizing at the same time so
it's $27 which for any grand I was like
and it's a small it's small so this is
one point five blue ounces that's a
little small yeah the ingredients
coconut oil mica powder and vitamin E
okay so these are all handmade in Los
Angeles oh yeah and it did take like ten
days to get here oh so I lowered my foot
I ordered one see this is really in the
house oh cool okay Sam I'm there's one
thing I want to call out I do have oil
on my hand when you open the package
they had already like almost like leaked
a little bit I mean yeah like it's
outside of the little slides like a
black oil this is definitely like that
and you guys screwed on tight they are
so I don't know why that happened a
little weird it's a little bit of a zone
greens on the bottom of course I know
like website
ran ran connecting so you might wanna
put it on there everybody so I guess we
can try this I want to bring the counter
hands first
yes for sure for safety I want to see if
they're actually glowing and amazing
because the pictures we've seen you guys
have been a little blinding yeah they've
been insane and nothing biss and I think
it's like all over Pinterest all of
googles everywhere if it's oil and the
website says you really can't put it on
your face after a full love yeah why
does that picture look so blinding yeah
it's a problem that's the picture she
obviously has on makeup so how I know so
I don't know I don't know a fan of the
brand made that was brand itself made it
what Iran may have not made that picture
but we can't figure it out do would
happen okay so what do I know other
people in the glitter one okay glitter a
full truck they work on man all right so
really good chicken up yeah
here she is rockin you know job huh okay
let's put it around here let's just like
oil and charcoal everyone you're gonna
do it we'll just the same damn time so
we're going to try to show this off oh
it's dripping oh it's dripping like okay

rub in oh wow

is like oh my god there's like really

all in my face honestly dude honestly
whoa it feels really wet we turn on the
flash on your phone is there glitter or
not like for real because right now

heavy hopefully these have a little bit
of pigment too and we can really see

about like the ingredients where it's at
coconut oil when I take off my makeup I
want to be pleased Kunal a lot of people

make it off to like moisturize under
their eyes so what you see you want to
do so I want to put a little bit of
foundation on my hands it said on the
website you can make the ammonia

if there's any difference okay how does
your foundation feel um so if you feel
sticky
okay so from looking here from the side
of you guys it looks shiny right here
and it is completely matte where bronzer

damp

again so let's go on the website this is
oh my god my finger is like glued so
this is the iridescent
rose highlighter it does say glistening
moisturizer is glistening on anything
we're doing so it's kind of doing what
it says on here but I just didn't know

my favorite honestly all right I'm gonna
do to you

why wait let me try to show without
dripping everywhere I'm just going to
use a brush I mean we want to spoke a
very luminous see like a little say a
word at a comedian one mm-hmm
now I'm done I gotta look you happen I
like so quiet cuz I really don't know
yeah this one looks less wet than the
glitter one yeah actually maybe this was
a little bit less but have I creepy feel
to it mystical that no never gonna get
really okay so the pinkish so that your
doesn't Rose isn't that bad I mean for
mixing but I still don't see it a glow
or anything to you oh my god that's
literally soil it's literally just oil
in a bomb what it looks like in here
does not translate on the hand holy shit
but employer it's a clear clear baby oil
look that looks like a twenty seven
dollar bottle of clear baby oil
no no no that's my brother's impression
that's I person same ingredients on this
one is rely on and no different
ingredients eight there's no using
luminosity or any feeling or nothing
right little accident so I mix it with
the foundation like it says there's no
glow now like the girl on the picture to
seem so P in frosted this is very clear
there's no prob there's no video there's
not a natural pigment in this exactly
hmm I guess the final test of time that
their version of a settings brace you
barely do little world and I look
girl all right so now we are about to
drive the new me rosewater priming and
settings lesbian I want to see I'm kinda
nervous okay let me just check it up it
looks cool in there seems like a lot of
let's really go so now this is $27 as
well
Lord now that packaging is cheap yeah
very all that at the dollar store a
little you okay so this is for anyone
that is dry normal or combination of
everybody anytime okay so this is for
illuminating and refreshing the skin it
is a conditioning setting spray this
beautiful and balancing mist with
rosewater extracts and botanicals to
help hydrate restore and soften the skin
while giving you a gorgeous glow shake
well before you okay you did that it to
begin its quoted Freight which is
awesome Japan now it's supposed to cure
dryness dullness and uneven skin tone
which how do you fix uneven skin tone
especially with that rose right with a
full coverage foundation under the hell
you do so ingredients rose water witch
hazel aloe vera and natural mica so for
those of you who don't know what mica is
it is basically like glitter pigmy like
if you see pigment or anything like that
there is mica and then so natural I
don't really know what they mean by
natural right late skincare I mean it's
weird to mix like a glitter with
rosewater so we're going to give it a
whirl I'm kind of wanting to spray my
hand there sure and just see if there's
any glow when wipe off this foundation
so nervous okay we're good number back
right here mm-hmm
okay where's it smell like to you a
little bit rosy okay okay
is there any glitter your hand looks the
same color you can especially tell
through the tires your skin's a little
lighter right there is there any mica
any glitter any shine shimmer nothing
what the actual fuck yeah dissing
definitely fingertips either now this
dry let me get your hands yeah okay good
alright that was a good one I just clear
this is like say your rose water I'm
like shocked I mean I wear glitter
you would see bronzer on my hand the
bride a big business it looks like this
in a bottle but it sprays out like clear
like that would be coming off you know
my fingertips yeah what's up okay
alright well I think it's time to give
our thoughts all right you guys saying
that I'm disappointed Laura would be an
understatement I agree completely
I'm like right off the bat when I
started when there was no website on the
bottle and it was crazy when every how
do you open it I will turned off I'm not
I know I know this was an indie brand
from I guess here like the internet from
Instagram but it really fell flat for me
like I've used some dope many brands of
my channel literally I have found $5.00
Lizzie I mean it's amazing any whoa I
feel like this is really $27 like oil
mm-hmm with no payoff
there was no shimmer and or going burn
no diva moment and yell a video it was
yeah like there was no it looks cool in
the bottle so if you want to like take a
picture of it or like with it or hold it
with your hand maybe like look your best
right when you said enough maybe you can
put your in your like passenger seat in
your car you can do carpool with it take
it boy it is in the movie fellas a new
as well the words I really your bad as
much as I might be gone your bird on
