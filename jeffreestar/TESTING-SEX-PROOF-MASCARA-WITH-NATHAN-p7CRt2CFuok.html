channel today I'm about to suck and see
if the mascara stays on mic drop okay
but for real but that's exactly what we
were doing today we are trying out the
Urban Decay new troublemaker mascara now
I've tried mascaras on this channel
before we've done the hourglass
stainless steel we've done the new
laurio drugstore mascara which I still
love and we all know that Benefit
Cosmetics roller lash is my favorite
mascara on the planet but we have a
particular today there is a new mascara
that just hit the market and it is
allegedly sex proof yes that's exactly
what it says on the box so I'm gonna
need to call Nathan for this one I don't
know if I can do this video alone for
now I'm going to attempt to apply this
mascara we're gonna talk about it we're
gonna feel it we're gonna touch it we're
gonna play with it and then we're gonna
see if it stays put so if you want to
see if this mascara works then keep on
watching
alright you guys so here is what the box
came in the mail looking like this is PR
from Urban Decay they did send me this
of course and it says hashtag here comes
trouble right on there now I do love the
hollow packaging I'm sure it's gonna
come in a smaller box of course when it
is in stores but oh and here's the box I
haven't even looked at it just keeping
it real
alright so this says super fat super
long sex proof mascara
alright garage is that big statement so
it comes like this I'm assuming this is
a box of course yes so let me just pop
these bad boys out of here and all right
so it says stir up trouble with thirteen
point seven times the lash of volume I
like this you know carton it is
definitely very urban decay we got the
purple going on behind me we got the
periwinkle
row but this mascara has a net weight of
0.25 ounces 0.33 this is the new Lancome
Moser and then the roller lash has 0.30
so I guess that is that's kind of
standard alright so what is this
mascaras supposed to do first of all it
looks like this I love the component I
think it looks a very cute I love the
oil slick packaging I love the it's like
this clear I don't know it's just
I think by now we've all seen a million
mascaras what could they do
packaging wise that is going to excite
us definitely exciting this will retail
for $24 which is pretty normal for a
mascara that is high-end and in Sephora
the box says a bunch of shit so we're
just gonna skim through and see what
this product is supposed to do to my
eyes now of course you guys see I did
very light I makeup I didn't do any
mascara nothing really just very you
know soft so the box says that this is
so good it should be illegal this is
supposed to have volume eyes and
lengthen as it separates while our
custom brush grabs onto lashes and curls
as it coats we loaded up this mess scar
with insane benefits okay so what does
it have in here it is supposed to ask
outlast the most scandalous nights and
still look good in the morning okay that
is a big claim on here so besides that
we're going to go on over to the website
and see what it says okay so this has a
vitamin e in it which is gonna nourish
and condition okay here we go the brush
now I've heard a lot of things about the
brush online first of all let's open her
up and let's see what the brush looks
like first and foremost oh oh it's Mikey
okay so almost looks like it has a
mohawk going right here let me hold my
head up in front of it and then as you
see you turn it it's like shorter hairs
but it does look a very spiky it looks a
little dangerous and I'm kind of into it
it says we designed it to calm and
separate lashes to make it look like you
have more of them tiny precision hooks
grab lashes to pull the product through
alright you guys so basically obviously
they're you know there ain't there ain't
nothing like crazy about it it's a
mascara we're gonna apply it to our eyes
nothing Crazy's gonna happen either it
works and I like it or it doesn't work
and then I am going to ask Nathan to
take me to the bedroom and
I don't know we're gonna see what
happens in 30 minutes and if it stays on
it stays on if it doesn't we gonna have
a problem urban decay all right you guys
know I normally don't ever curl my
lashes you will hardly ever see this in
my hand I haven't time to know my body
though but I am going to give it a fair
shot because every time that lipstick
Nick does my makeup she always has me
curl my own lashes so I'm like you know
what let me at least give it a whirl so
I'm just gonna do this like a normal
person
must feel so weird I never do this you
guys alright so those are my normal
lashes look like I think by now you all
know what the fuck they look like
alright so we are going to give this a
whirl now the bristles look really sharp
there looks like there is a lot of
product on the wand I'm gonna hold it
out with the backdrop so you can really
see it one more time and let's see if it
hooks in
so here is the right side of course with
it only on the top and here is what my
normal eyes look like do you see a
difference y'all will have to tell me
right now all right I'm gonna do the
bottom mascara I'm gonna dunk in one
more time like I normally would and
notice how this one definitely has that
crazy like rubber type of whoo it bends
so now let's do the bottoms
all right so the bottom lashes are
coated I'm actually really liking how
this is looking all right you guys so
here is the side with the mascara and
here is my normal boring blank side over
here
you guys tell me what you think of the
difference all right now I am going to
quickly do this side and then we're
gonna put this bitch to the test
alright so the mascara is on both eyes
now I'm actually really liking how it's
looking it definitely hooked in there it
curled the lashes of course this is also
a first impressions besides seeing if it
works I love how it made the bottoms
look they're very separated they look
pretty the top ones are nice I would
definitely wear this by itself without
falsies and just let it live so overall
I do like how it looks right away which
is great now if the real question is
where's Nathan hey baby
I'm babe alright so you don't even know
why we're here not really no no Nate's
been growing weed in the desert for a
few weeks that were just we're just
wrapping out right now okay so today
babe we are trying out you know urban
decay love them they have a new mascara
six proof mm-hmm alright so this out we
are if you're in the mood I mean I mean
I mean I'm always in the mood so
basically this is supposed to be a sex
proof mascara so I thought we could
literally I mean look we're we're doing
life experiments here on YouTube I think
the Jeffrey star has taken YouTube to
the next realm with get readies and jets
Royals Royces crazy vlogs around the
world so I'm like a look at the end of
the day we really gotta test this out so
I figured we would go into the bedroom
for I don't know 20 30 minutes and just
see if this is gonna work alright now
it's supposed to stay on
at all costs at all costs a I mean it
doesn't say super fast super long six
proof but yeah so hey this is it okay I
like the cool oil slick look to it
though it doesn't come off additional
bag I love all right cool so I guess
we're gonna go see if I can get pregnant
oh all right guys we'll be right back
come on baby
all right you guys this is the fucking
funny Asia I think I've ever done in my
channel I have spit all over me
alright so this is what happened after
10 minutes of in the shower yeah I mean
it looks like it's running it's running
I look up and my eyes are kind of
burning right now you guys so I don't
know what is going on obviously the
mascara is probably in my eyes but we're
gonna zoom in right here and you guys
are gonna see this is what oral sex this
what happens after oral sex in 10
minutes so let me look at let me zoom in
on myself real quick alright oh my god
first of all I have saliva on all over
me
alright you guys well I don't really
have much of a gag reflex at all so it
took me a minute to get some tears going
and some sweat we turned on the steamer
in the shower oh and ha yeah and
definitely smeared so here's the good
news I just quit people when I say this
the good news is is that I actually
liked how the product lied
I like the wand I love the bristles the
wand
I love the bristles and I liked how my
lashes look pre prior to this right
right yes did it hold up in the shower
and there was no water on my face
obviously you guys see my highlight
still poppin I do have spit all over my
face but it did drip it did not stay on
it really didn't and there was no water
on me there was nothing like crazy
obviously cuz my shadow stole a girl but
yeah I just wanted to you not touch
anything and run in here and show you
guys exactly what happened so is the
Urban Decay troublemaker mascara sex
proof well it sure ain't steam and dick
proof it's not you know ten minutes of
fucking around and this happened so I
don't think it's sex proof at all
obviously I'm not sure what the formula
is if it's supposed to be waterproof I
mean sex proof is a big statement it is
a very bold statement and it didn't work
you guys I'm so sad urban decay with
them I definitely used my all nighter
setting spray and my foundation looks
laid still my highlight looks beaming
yes I mean maybe this helped face it
definitely didn't get wet obviously no
so this is kind of weird I'm like on the
fence because I don't want to jeffree
star approves late necessarily if it did
not do everything instead it was going
to do but good news is I actually love
the formula would you mind using it
again and I thought that it made my
lashes look really really pretty so if
you just want a new great mascara that
will stay on when you were at work I
definitely highly recommend this one but
if you want to get on your knees and
still look great afterwards I do not
recommend this one so yeah it's not too
if we start proof but I like how it
looks so you guys already you know you
get it you get the gist
you get the gist so didn't work here but
I loved how it looked before this well
that was probably the funniest thing
we've ever done on my channel yeah I
would say so
besides everyone thinking I used your
nutsack to blend out my foundation yeah
that was pretty good which that did not
happen but is it not I mean yeah
hopefully YouTube is not restrict or
flagged this video I was just testing
out a makeup product and that is that
there was nothing x-rated about this one
so YouTube don't play a bitch thanks for
coming on again baby it's my pleasure
alright we are going to go finish what
we started thank you guys so much for
watching and what do we say can't wait
to see on the next one we'll see you on
the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
