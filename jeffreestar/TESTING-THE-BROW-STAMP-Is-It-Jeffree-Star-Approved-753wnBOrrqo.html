channel today oh girl
today okay today today we are trying out
the crazy brow stamp that I've seen a
lot of youtubers and beauty gurus review
over the last few months but here's the
catch all of them had brown hair and
this bitch has zero brow hair so I think
I am now if I'm wrong I'm wrong I have
not researched this but from all the
reviews that I've seen I am the first
person without any brow hair to try out
the infamous brows stamp now of course
there are several brands that make these
and I saw my on Amazon it is from a
brand called kiss and it's called I envy
and it looks something like this and I
got it from Amazon for $11.85 y85 girl
why not just a flat 12 okay but um this
came on Amazon Prime and I got it in one
day and here's a funny thing is this has
been sitting in my house for like three
months probably so many products keep
coming out I really like it can't keep
up and it's like oh my god so I'm
finally getting around to trying this
and so many people I've used it lately
on my girl is time so if you want to see
me try this crazy raps damn and keep on
watching
alright so this comes in a crazy plastic
thing that these nails are not going to
open so let's get some scissors and cut
into this thing girl oh okay so oh my
god I did not see that when I got like I
didn't see this to the packaging but it
comes with a right and a left brow camp
and it looks something like this so
obviously you do not get to choose the
shape of your brow this is the shape
that the company is chosen for install
wow I mean that's not a bad shape for my
eye I'm not gonna lie
let's see if it works oh right let's
read the instructions that is butchered
alright simply stamp your favorite
eyebrows evenly no mess no fail quick
and easy brow application whether you
have a light brows or have lost to brows
due to over tweezing or alopecia the
eyebrow stamp pre-shaped left and right
will create the perfect natural looking
eyebrow
a few seconds that will last all day all
right so it says be sure that your skin
above your eye is dry and clean of
course I have foundation on a little bit
of highlighter but my skin is clean it
says pat on the pressed powder with the
stamp you just got a position it stamp
it on against the skin and press touch
up if needed it says on the little
picture here okay so this does come with
two graphs dance they pop out like this
so of course you can put them back easy
which i think is kind of cool and of
course the brows look like this oh my
god you guys this is going to be
interesting I've never even tried a brow
stamp before you know I've shaved my
eyebrows off in tenth grade and I always
get asked like do you use brow stencils
or I honestly just freehand them on
every single day of course recently and
you know several years ago I did no
brows for like a year I'm kind of
getting into the fun phase of using
highlighters for brows and other stuff
like that but I always freehand them on
so this is going to be interesting now
the powder is in this thing it just says
browse stamps in shade dark brown it was
the only shade that I saw on Amazon
yeah it says that it is made in Korea
interesting okay and it says the company
is from Port Washington New York and
that's it I think we should get started
you guys I was expecting on Mir right
here not gonna lie I was definitely
expecting a mirror I'm like okay you can
use this in this BAM nope no mirror I'm
interested to see if this is like a
powder or a cream type of thing it says
it's like a powder so I'm just gonna
take my finger you guys and just touch
the outside oh it almost feels like oh
come on pigment and it was feels like
I'm not wet powder but like a you know
almost like this was a little cooling or
like not powder obviously you guys see
no fallout and okay I mean it actually
stuck to my finger because it's supposed
to be permanent right I mean okay I mean
not in a bad way but like oh this is
gonna work okay let me wipe it this off
of my body and we're gonna get started
alright so I have the right brow in my
hand
so I'm going to take the brow and of
course it's clean I am going to press it
down firmly now you see how squishy
let's get the product all over it oh wow
so you kind of have to like drag it
around for a second oh now we've got
some fallout girl all right so the
applicator is completely covered now see
that totally opaque here is what it
looked like before the powder make sure
it is completely coated and don't play
games I'm just going to take a large
mirror over here and oh my god I'm like
nervous I'm like fuck okay I'm like put
this mirror back a little bit you guys
act like guess like where this is going
this is like scary territory like do we
want it high do we want it low I think
that's probably a good length so let me
line it up with my tear duct and oh my
god I just did it way too high you guys
well the end has some powder fallout so
that is why it looks like this on the
end Lord okay let me wipe off this
excess powder before it stains my skin
that's a high brow that is a high mother
effing brow I'm never going to this is
in one more time on here it says that
you can touch it up I'm scared to like
put this on one more time but I'm gonna
try to match it up perfectly oh my god
sorry guys if I'm blocking its scaring
okay it's a little darker I mean that is
a high brow you'd have to get like 10
faceless up to God to even get this -
pro okay we gotta try the other side
I'm still gagging over ow hi put that
brow hey fuck it right okay so that
wasn't me right brow no we're going to
do a left brow which you can see is
blank with no product and let's go in
again maybe I won't stamp is hard
because I have a wrinkle residue at the
end I'm like fuck me let's aim a little
lower this time minke I'm gonna have to
really fucked up brows okay here we go
oh my god oh my god well I definitely
had some commas why does this one look
like almost a different shape but
they're not they're like identical but
um I hate the shape with his brows I'm
gonna admit it I fucking hate the shape
I am NOT down for this natural look this
is not natural hmm this is not natural
at all I'm gonna try right near that one
and just see what happens the shape is
horrifying you guys I just want to put
that out there in case you're at home
watching and you didn't know I'm not
down for the shape I think we should
also get to the real real review of
talking about the product I think that
the powder is I mean it says it's
designed for people with also no hair so
I expected the powder to be a little bit
more opaque it says touch-up it's needed
I would literally have to go and with
like a brush let's just use a pencil
brush here and I would have to like
paint on more coverage right which is
not looking that great when I even did
that I'm like oh girl this is rough I
mean the means and the screenshots that
I am about to receive right now I'm
scared
okay let's just see what happens if we
do one more now my real brow probably
would have been like that oh my god why
does the arch do that
and the plastic you guys just went in my
skin right here with powder
I'm not down I am NOT into this I
honestly think that if you already have
a brow this could help you quickly like
do a fill-in but if you were someone
like me I don't know about this I don't
fucking know let's do the side just for
a laugh where I've already fucked up my
makeup this far in oh where was the
coverage on this we're fucking powder
just like really go in and like get the
beat up this compact ah alright I'm
gonna go take a hit and I'll be right
back alright you guys now thank you so
much for watching my Halloween tutorial
and how to be a cat if this is not the
final look I don't know what is I'm
ready for the runway Shante you stay
honey what's going on right now my life
and the broad stamp is not Jeffries our
brew I hate it I think the formula the
powder is weird it's bizarre it is not
fully opaque it's very weird and
long-lasting and just came off my
fucking cheeks girl that kind of almost
look like a tarantula like spider legs
you're like it's like a spider sat on my
face - spiders house Aegina I'm not the
Google that later hope you've enjoyed me
degrading myself for everyone yay and
I'm not down I really do not prank this
product
I definitely think and I'm going to
sound like a broken record if you
already have brow hair this could be a
quick easy moment for you if you're
someone that hates filling in your brows
you could easily like stamp this over
for me it's not it this is not the one
the double brow effects though is almost
like an optical illusion like I'm are
you guys watching me in 3d
whoo okay you're not and you know that
alright I'm babbling this is time to end
alright you guys aw see you on the next
video mwah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
