a summer snow cone and the other one is
called crystal ball I will swatch them
of course later in the video
and besides that you guys know we're not
done we're not done I have three velour
lip scrubs now I know as so many of you
are a fan of them and this summer we
have these amazing flavors I really
wanted to like take it there with the
smell and the taste and just get them
really fresh and amazing
so with these guys I will of course be
showing them all and later in the video
as well and I wish you can taste them
through this screen because they're
amazing everything in the entire
collection will be available

only like like two lipsticks or three
you can definitely just buy those or if
you want everything of course you can
get everything we're about to dive into
some swatches so if you want to see
everything try to on my mouth and on my
cheeks then keep on watching all right
you guys I removed my lipstick and I'll
let's get to swatching I'm going to
start with the liquid lipsticks first
and then I will be doing
Alif mo and then of course the skin
frost and then we'll be playing with the
lip scrub so if you want to jump around
in the video of course you can but with
the below or a liquid lipsticks we have
eight shades this summer six of them are
of course matte in my normal amazing
formula yes they just call me one
formula amazing don't quote me now this
summer the metallic shades smell like
strawberries oh my god they're so yummy
but the mattes don't have any fragrance
I noticed that sometimes when you add
fragrances to lipsticks it could kind of
manipulate or change them and I'm not
into really compromising the formula I
have perfected adding rootbeer in some
of mine
and of course creamsicle and my lip mo
but this summer
we're going to relax so let's get
started first shade is the lightest in
the collection and it looks something
like this it is called butt naked and it
is a gorgeous peachy nude it is really
light but also really stunning and it
just looks like oh let me show you guys
what she looks like
all right here is what but make it looks
like it is really light so if you are of
course medium or a dark skin tone I
would definitely recommend um bringing
them or using a lip liner or I mean if
you want to be bold and do it by itself
I think that would also look kind of
stunning a little high fashion and I'm
obsessed with that look let's do the
next one
alright the next shade I actually wore
in a video about a month or two ago it
was my full face first impression and I
used the shade in the video it is called
Calabasas which of course is the city
where I live in California
this color just really reminded me of
home when it was on I don't know why I
got that feeling but it just came over
me so I named it after that and it is a
really gorgeous color I know a lot of
you kept asking me like oh my god what
is that and when I finally wore it I
know a lot of you were excited about it
so I can't wait to see this on all of
you but I am of course going to swatch
it again for anyone that I didn't see it
you
there is it all swatch on my lips I
think this might be one of my favorite
liquid lips from the eight I am just
like I've been wearing this a morning
and night and the third shade is this
beautiful warm toned camel nude called
hunty oh my god you guys I am obsessed
with this shade when I was making in the
lab I wanted something that was very
like like really warm and rich looking
and I think this is going to be a one of
your guys's favorites let's watch her
here is shade hunty dry mwah the next
shade is the darkest shade in the
collection it is called family jewels
and it is a beautiful warm toned like
chocolatey brown it's like a milk
chocolate it is so stunning and let's
give her a whirl
and here is family jewels dried down
alright the next shade is a really cool
funky color you guys don't always have
to have some weird colors in my brand I
am all down for being a weirdo and this
one is very daring it is a matte
chartreuse color and it is called a
Venus flytrap it is a very daring is
very bold obviously and the cool thing
about my brand and the formula is that
all of my of a lower liquid lips are I
say so you can put them in your
waterline you can use them as eyeliner
you can do them as a wing so they are of
course very multi-use a lot of people
love doing lip art they love on braying
and they love being creative so this is
for all my artists out there
and here is a Venus flytrap dried down
now you know what's crazy when you make
cosmetics you guys weird colors like
yellow and weird purples and greens are
really difficult to make but I think
this one is really amazing it doesn't
look crazy well the color looks a little
crazy but I try to make this like matte
as hell and I love it so the next person
that invites me to a wedding I'm wearing
this let's swatch a few metallics before
we do the final matte lip now this is a
gorgeous I'm going to call it like a
coral pinky crazy metallic and this
shade is called candy ass this one is
belonging it is full of like sparkle let
me show you guys what this looks like
all right here is candy ask dry now if
you see how I move my head in the light
is very reflective it is really pretty
and it has a lot of metallic pearls in
there to give it such a beautiful finish
and of course when I say pearls I mean
pearl pigments that are man-made and not
pearls from the ocean some people are
like wait a minute don't get it twisted
I am obsessed with this color and I
think it is going to be perfect for
summer
the second metallic shade in the
collection is called a flamboyant it is
a gorgeous bright coral like on fire in
your face coral and this metallic is a
little different than candy yes it has
less like metal feel but still has like
that glittery just amazingness and
remember that these metallics in the
summer collection it smell like fresh
strawberries I'm hungry
and here is a flamboyant and dry on the
mouth it has such a gorgeous Sheen to it
and it is very bright alright let's
watch the last one last but not least
the last matte liquid lip in the
collection is a stunning gorgeous bright
purple so many of you have been
requesting me to make a purple like this
in my collection and it's finally here
its importation now this shade is called
you better work which of course the
lipstick bundle was named after I mean I
think I said that saying since I was
like 10 years old
we have RuPaul saying it we have Britney
Spears saying it and it's kind of like a
staple in the makeup community so you
better get on my mouth
and here is the shaded dry on the lips
it is such a vibrant gorgeous purple so
I hope you guys love all the evil or
liquid lipstick from the collection and
now let's watch some lip ammunition
now the first shade from the lip
ammunition chrome collection is called
Birkin suede which if you know me you
know I am a fashion whore and this was
definitely inspired by one of my
favorite colors a suede inside of a
handbag it is probably the lightest nude
from this collection
she looks something like this in the
component and let's get her on the mouse
here is Birkin suede swatched it is
definitely the lightest nude in the
collection so if you are a little like
darker than this color or way darker of
course you can match it with any lip
liner and it will look flawless all
right now the next shade is this
beautiful warm toned Brown it is called
a birthday suit and it is one of my
favorites from the collection and let's
see how she looks on
here is a birthday suit and the third
shade is this a beautiful terracotta I
like to call her like an orange nude and
she is called a star witness listen this
color is going to look amazing and
stunning and beautiful on everyone so
let's give her a swatch
all right here is a star witness are in
the next shade is called thick as
thieves which is one of my favorite
little sayings about people and this is
the darkest shade of the collection it

but not least is a one of my favorite
shades now I actually wore this on my

the velour lip scrub this summer I am
launching three of the lower lip scrubs
and they're in brand new flavors that
I've never done before now if you are
new to my channel or have never used my
lip scrubs before they are infused with
aloe vera
they are also edible they have a vitamin
E in them and they leave your lips
feeling just like soft pillows
afterwards and of course like I said you
can't eat them you can lick them but
please do not substitute them for a meal
let's start off with introducing the
first flavor this is a watermelon gum
now in my current line strawberry gum is
my number one top seller so I was like
you know what how do I make something as
amazing and I'm like watermelon is like
I mean last year the lipstick smelled
like watermelon now in this summer we
have the amazing lip scrub now of course
they come in these beautiful chrome
packages like everything else and these
ones you guys I'm just going to be
honest I'm gonna take a little out
myself on my finger mmm it is so good if
I didn't have lipstick on I would rub it
all over my mouth right now
now this literally of course you guys
can't smell or taste it yet it literally
is like bubblegum from your childhood of
just like the ones that used to look
like little watermelons if you don't
know what that means I don't hope they
make that anymore it's like a very like
90s early 2000s but um this is so yummy
the second flavor is blue raspberry
sucker now you guys know I am such a
sucker for candy and sweets and sugar
I'm obsessed with dessert
now I love this sugar because I made a
gorgeous like almost like it's an icy
from a movie theater blue oh my god it's
like sweet tarts in your mouth it is so
yummy I'm like mmm dessert is served and
the third and last flavor is orange soda
I am such a lover of like orange soda
since I was a child I love it it
definitely reminds me of summer and of
course you guys know I had to do the
sugar all orange now I did use this a
lot this week so this one's a little
well used and oh my god so in the lab I
