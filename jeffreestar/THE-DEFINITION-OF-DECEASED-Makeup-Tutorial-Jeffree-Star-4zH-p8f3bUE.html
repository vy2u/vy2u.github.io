channel now as promised I told you guys
I would be recreating this look that I
did in my top 10 drugstore highlighter
video when I put it up everyone was like
where's that tutorial so of course I had
to do it for you guys this is a very
dark dramatic sultry kind of look at
that glitter in the inner corner
highlight too Jeff now the title of this
video is called the definition of
deceased now what does that mean it's
basically like the fiercest look that
you can do on your own self where all
your friends and family are like huh
like they're dead they're done like the
it's a wrap so this is kind of like your
way of saying I am gonna kill and slay
you all like you're about to murder
everybody in sight if it looks could
kill so use hashtag deceased on Twitter
and Instagram so I could see the looks
if you want to recreate this little
madness now also this week me and
nikkietutorials we started a new
challenge where we were so inspired from
Mario's video of doing her full face and
just highlighters we were like we're
gonna make this a challenge so you guys
broke my youtube record for 1.1 million
views in just one day I was like oh like
I woke up and it was only like 18 hours
from when I posted it and it was already
over a million and I was just like oh my
god that is crazy so thank you guys
so much for breaking my record and you
also broke Nicky's record we're just so
happy that you guys are all into the
glow season and I'm just excited that
people are you know just enjoying makeup
like I think some people take things way
too serious at the end of the day all
this wipes off and you can start again
tomorrow so if you're one of those
people that's a little uptight and you
take yourself too serious take a hit and
get over yourself alright now in other
news you guys are going to see when this
intro is over that I finally got to dye
my hair so of course my real hair has
been growing out my roots are like
treacherous in my last video I'm so
sorry you guys had to
those roots for that long so besides
that if you want to see how to create
this madness then keep on watching now
I'm a type of person that likes to eat
their dessert before dinner so we're
gonna be snatching this nose and doing
our highlight first I'm going to take
this Lexy brush this was created by JD
way tea girl I love you and this is
everything now I saw my girl
nikkietutorials using this the other day
and I was like thank God someone's
talking about this because this brush
it's a life I know it's sold out a few
times it is really big on Instagram so
if you can get ahold of this get ahold
of it now I'm just going to be dipping
into my Kat Von D shade and light
palette and I like to mix these two
shades on the Left BAM and hide that is
my fingernail gouging out the pan who
hates when you up your pan we're
going to be taking this side first very
skinny and we're just going to be
dipping into this once literally once
there's a lot of pigment the closer you
put the two lines together to create
that shadow the more pinched your nose
is going to be so I am gonna really
bring mine in it's crazy what makeup can
do look at how crazy and vague it looks
on the end now because I haven't
finished it come on illusions yes now
we're going to take the fluffy side and
this has no product on it and I'm just
gonna
bilenda and buff it out a little bit now
I'm being really soft with my pressure
so it just looks effortless and then I'm
going to start to drag it down a little
this way and then I'm gonna take some
darkness and blend that up on the
nostrils come on nostrils how's your day
and then with the damp Beauty Blender
I'm just going to lightly go over those
edges where they're a little more dark
at the top all right now to make sure
this nose stays snatched I'm going to be
dipping in with a little bit of kett
cosmetics girl I hit pan on this the
other day I am upset so I definitely
need a new one
this is a invisible setting powder and I
love it really good to set under the
eyes if you have any problems with
creasing the nose is set now to recreate
that extreme highlight from that
drugstore look I'm going to be pulling
out my sleek makeup and now
this brand whoo it is so good these
highlighters are extreme I use this in
my rolls-royce video as well and
everyone was like doing all bitching
blinding us
dayum dayum dayum so I'm gonna be taking
my morphe m5 one zero or the five 10s we
call it on the streets this one this is
the one you guys I'm going to be taking
this shade and this shade now this
palette has three powders in one cream
and now when I talked about it before I
said the wrong thing oops I'm clocking
myself so these two I love mixing so I'm
just going to start out by mmm that's
all you need you guys because this is
dead ly now I'm just going to take us on
the high plains of my cheekbones and I'm
not going to bring it down as low as I
normally do because I want to look
really high and elevated it's like a
lavender glass is on my cheeks alright
now it's time for the Cupid's bow so
let's just dust on there I like to look
like I was drinking a glass of silver
surfers come so I'm just gonna you know
really intensify that lip and because
I'm walking to my lipstick for a minute
I'm just gonna dust someone here because
my bottom lip is like now the nose was
really important so I'm just gonna take
one little finger swipe that's all you
need and I'm just gonna rub it on the
end and we're just gonna dust that and
go up so it's like a really really
really extreme now sometimes I'll go
back in with that you know it's contour
I just kind of clean up a little bit
snatch God's now let's get onto these
eyes for the highlight under the brow
all the way to the lid color we're gonna
be dipping into my Beauty color palette
now this sold out so quickly when it
launched a few weeks ago I was like
jesus take the wheel so now my site is
officially restocked so if you want to
dip into this madness all summer long
give it a try
I'm gonna be using this amazing like
bone ivory color this is called China
white and I'm just using a little flat
synthetic brush let's get to blending
now to get that really dark smoky eye
it's actually way easier than you think
I'm just going to be using this Mac
Paint Pot this is from the pro
collection it's called black ground it
is really dope so I'm basically just
going to coat my entire lids with this
and then you shout out to buff and blend
and make it really smoky so it's really
not hard and there's really no fallout
with this which is amazing so I'm gonna
be using this little Chanel Blender
synthetic brush and we're just going to
dip right in hi
it works quickly now it depends on where
you want it I like to have mine all the
way in and then we'll put some highlight
on the outside so I'm just going to
start by coating my entire lid now this
has so much pigment and this brush is
just gonna help get it blend it out a
little bit so I am gonna stop it right
here and then I'm gonna drag it down and
I'll probably keep it just like that and
then you got to drag it in and of course
we use a lot more pigment let me dip
into my pot and that's it you're just
gonna coat all the way over now of
course if you don't like it all the way
in the inner corner you can scale it
back this is just what I prefer and then
I'd like to drag it out this way and
that's it now this part does not look
pretty so you're like oh good morning
Panda this is obviously just the base so
you know it's got to look a little ugly
before it gets pretty kind of like my
bar the black is a light now let's blend
it out I'm gonna take a little Mac two
one seven brush and I'm gonna dip into
some gray eyeshadow now there are so
many new palettes out you guys how the
hell are we ever gonna all get ready on
the same page I'm like now this one by
Urban Decay is really dope this is the
Alice Through the Looking Glass palette
that Urban Decay create and this is
amazing first of all if we can just give
a round of applause for packaging
because I died when I saw this you guys
look you open up this and um hi so dope
I love butterflies by the way now the
palette is down here and you just pull
her out BAM I love people that pull out
okay so now this palette has some really
dope shades now the other day when I
created that look I was
like looking for some great shadows it's
kind of hard to find a great and more
people make them please this little
palette is genius
now there's one called mirror dream on
and time and I'm going to be dipping
into all of those in a minute but first
I'm just gonna dip into mirror yes
mirror and then a little dot of time
sometimes I like to mix to get a more
customized color and I'm just gonna coat
my entire brush so we're gonna buff this
out and just really go lightly over that
harsh line and start dragging up a
little bit just so it starts to get that
amazing Blandy look it's just a lot of
really small back and forth motions and
then what we're gonna do is when we
start to drag it up we're going to take
this brush and dip it back into China
white so we're just going to blend back
and forth back and forth so a lot of
back and forth motions today all right
now to get that really big dramatic eye
we're gonna take a blending brush just
pick your favorite it could be anybody's
and we're gonna get back into mirror and
then just do a little bit of dream on
and now we're gonna really smoke up and
out and you start blending up now I'm
sure you're like you look a little
different than that last look contact
lenses you guys I was wearing these icy
white blue lenses and they are from desi
oh these are usually the brand aware in
all of my videos now these are from
Italy they're amazing you can order them
online so I'm gonna put these in and
this literally transforms the entire
look it really makes your eyes pop so
big so I'm just gonna take my eye like
this and just press it on my eye I mean
hi now my smokey eye looks unreal and
I'm in love so you see a difference
these make on my eyes now if your eyes
water just pray to mother Mary and I'll
have to just dab it with my Beauty
Blender I mean shit's already wet right
that the contacts are in obviously the
smokey eye is like biome it's like a way
poppier now so let's do the under eyes
all right now for my waterline today I'm
gonna be using a new product yes no more
pencil liner now this is the new
auto-stop C at Beverly Hills gel liner
yes and it's waterproof so I'm really
down for this now this one is called
dark side and we're just gonna pop this
in the waterline and see what happens
ooh this is so black and amazing I'm
gonna use this little Tom for it number
14 blending brush and we're just going
to dip into time a little dot I mean
it's so pigmented so a little goes a
long way and then I'm going to dip into
dream on a little bit just kind of mix
those two together now be careful for
Fallout you guys so sometimes we'll take
my brush and I'll just slap it once and
then we're just going to connect the
inner corner and start blending out all
down the waterline now we're gonna take
a blank brush and we're gonna dip into
the shade called dream on now this
sounds like little glitter in it it's so
pretty
it's very whimsical and then you're just
gonna go over the darkness so if you saw
the first time I did this look you're
like there's like a little iridescent so
that's what this is and we're just going
to go over the entire lash line so it's
like come on smoke okay we are really
getting smoked out you guys I'm like a
girl speaking of feel it girl feel it
all right now if you get that inner
corner glowing we're gonna be using the
new busy art palette oh look at those
colors you guys this is called the
Boheme dream and oh I just cannot I
think I want to do a whole look with
this entire palette soon but for now
we're just gonna be dipping into this
silver moment right here
oh girl and I'm just going to put this
over the black that we already have down
and it's just going to get a little just
a little pop in the corner
and I'm just doing small little circular
motions and working that in there and
then I did bring it down just a little
bit on my inner corner and then I put
glitter on top of it so that's what
we're gonna do today all right so that's
like our little base and now
oh now for the makeup born I'm gonna
pull out this Mac reflex pearl oh it's
really pretty I'm like mm-hmm I used to
wear this all over my entire cheekbones
back in the day and I'm still using it
and I'm obsessed so I am just going to
really intensify this by wetting the
brush this is life and then we're just
gonna dip into the pot now this is an
old school Mac pot from when I used to
work there ten years ago and they still
have this color it's still poppin I
guess thank God because this is one of
my favorites so now I'm just gonna place
this right in here and this is what you
guys saw in that picture if you were
like what in the hell was that sparkle
this is porn to me like I don't need to
even watch people have sex at this stage
I just need to watch people put on
glitter dust off any fallout immediately
all right now this just changed the
entire look now it's time to put on some
false lashes so we're gonna grab our
roller lash from benefit you guys know
this is my favorite oh Lord
and we're just gonna coat my lashes with
this uh-huh yes all right let's dip it
one more time oh this brush on the
bottoms you guys it's just like it is so
perfect
all right mascara is done now what kind
of false lashes do we want to do today
there I mean I got a stick true to what
I did for that look the other day so I'm
gonna be using my new bouncing a Russian
black oh these are everything especially
for this kind of look it just takes your
lashes up to a whole new level so let's
get our a speedo
lash glue latex free thank you Jesus and
let's apply these bad boys I just found
this benefit brush and I'm like oh my
god let me take some glitter and just I
love how tattoos look with glitter on
top it's like oh come on grandma is
shining from
yes girl come on now now that R on an
intergalactic level let's get to those
lashes the other day I fast forwarded my
lashes and a lot of you were wondering
why I took the wand and I put it lightly
on my inner corner right there and then
I also took the wand and I put a little
bit on the end that way the lashes
really stay on all day like sometimes I
don't care what lash school I could even
use submit my inner corner it's gonna
come up a little bit so when I do double
on the lash and on here it pretty much
stays and this brand is really amazing
so check them out and let's put these on
all right lashes are on fleek whoo now I
think the only thing I want to do is add
in a little bit of blush I did have some
pink blush when I first created this
look I'm just gonna take a little more
feet III brush and I'm just going to dip
into this little Camilla blush by Becca
I love their packaging these are really
cool cuz there's a highlight basically
like in the blush so I'm just gonna dab
in a little bit and we're just gonna
just do the little apples of my cheeks
now that I got my little rosy glow on I
think it's time for some lips okay so
I'm really excited today because I have
a new collection of limited edition
liquid lips coming out this July and I'm
gonna debut a shade for you guys now I'm
like nervous to even show you guys
because I've been working on this for a
minute there are five shades they are
going to be limited so they are
watermelon infused and they smell like
watermelon Jolly Ranchers they are so
good they are of course vegan and
cruelty-free just like all my other
liquid lips and they are in limited
edition packaging whoo come on yellow so
the packaging for this summer is all hot
yellow it's very bright very vibrant and
this shade is called virginity and it is
like
pale lavender nude this is like I'm
nudes purple sister and it's one of my
favorite I wore this in my top 10
favorite drugstore highlighters a few
weeks ago and everyone was like what is
on your lips I can't wait for you guys
to see this on me I'm just like okay I'm
hungry again come on I mean come on you
guys
I felt like my Brad was definitely
lacking a shade like this
no I'm royalty and blow pony had been
such hits I'm like I got to make like a
lighter version than both of those two
all right
the shade is dry I don't know about you
guys but I am obsessed so I will show
you guys the rest of its collection in a
video soon but I had to give you guys a
sneak peek first alright now let's get
on some setting spray and finish this
look all right now for setting spray in
my last video a lot of you were like oh
my god I love Tasha but you just wasted
the whole bottle honey you better replay
that video I was getting my holy spirit
and I was even getting my ghost some
setting spray and even my soul if you
guys caught you know the back row so I
did use about half a bottle last time so
of course I had to get two more because
this one can you guys see that oh my god
she is empty so since this one right now
guys no I had to get a few more of these
so I think it's only fitting since you
guys thought I wasted way too much
straight last time let's just do a
double whammy right now so it's a little
quicker let's get our engines ready one
more damn time
Oh
mother Virginia mother Virginia all
right now that I'm taking a bath
let's put on some hair all right this is
the final look I am obsessed with this
wig I get asked all the time who makes
that wig so if you want to know all
about the hair it is in the description
box below I am loving it so this is like
my ideal look on myself I think ever
since I was little and I started
dabbling into makeup I've always loved
to do really dark eyes highlighted
features and you know soft lips maybe a
hot pink maybe a black lipstick it no
matter what lip it is but this is just
like my favorite look on myself so I
hope you guys enjoyed this look and what
looks do you guys want me to do I know a
lot of people want me to do other types
of videos so we're gonna be doing a lot
more lifestyle stuff with Nathan and
maybe my warehouse and I also want to go
inside my makeup factory and show you
guys how we make the product so if you
guys like those ideas give me some
feedback below and I will see you on the
next one bye guys ma</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
