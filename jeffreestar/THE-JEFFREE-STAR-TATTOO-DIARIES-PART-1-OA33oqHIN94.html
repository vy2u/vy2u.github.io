what's up everyone welcome back to my
channel now today you are viewing me in
4k this is my first ever 4k video now
I'm like listen I have definitely been
doing makeup tutorials for almost a full
year now which is insane and every video
and I'm talking about every video I get
a request and over the years I've always
gotten the questions like hey talk about
your tattoos do a video I'm gonna be
doing sections of my body per video
because girl the volume is a lot so for
today's video I'm gonna be showing you
guys from my neck all the way down to my
stomach right above my pubic area
hanging now I know a lot of people
thought I would never do this video I
don't know why I think maybe you know
cuz all the drama that happened this
summer and all the craziness but um you
know I would never disrespect cats art I
just want to put that out there now even
though we were friends for 10 years you
never know you're going to literally
wake up one morning and have your best
friend backstab you in front of the
entire world and online so we met in
2007 all the way until you know
literally seven months ago we knew each
other so that took up a huge chunk of my
life and I spent a lot of time bonding
and being tattooed from her so I just
want to put it out there that no matter
what happened no matter what she did to
me no matter what you know played out at
the end of the day I respect her artwork
I think that she is one of the best
portrait tattooers in the entire world
now I am so proud to be covered by her
work she tattooed so many cool moments
um you know I'm not gonna dive into
talking about all the tattoos just yet
but like even you know I'm touching my
neck and I'm like that's my great
grandmother who you know passed away
while I was in high school and she did
this memorial piece um you know I'm just
like feeling my body and I'm like you
know we had so many close sentimental
moments and I will always respect her
artwork I think she is unreal at
anything she does whether it's makeup or
oil painting or tattooing she just kills
that art and is such an unreal tattooer
and I am just blessed and honored to be
covered by her work and I will never be
ashamed of that no matter what happened
that will never take away those feelings
so I think I just want to touch on a few
more things because so many people saw
me years ago on her show LA Ink um this
is not gonna be a crazy video about any
more drama the drama is dead in my eyes
and what happened happened so the only
thing that's crazy is that literally
every tattoo but one on my side for this
video she tattooed so you're gonna hear
a lot of history and a lot of cool
stories now I'm looking at this stack of
books and I'm like girl so I'm gonna
take you guys down memory lane
a really quickly so in 2007 is when I
got my first tattoo done by Kat I
emailed and this is before she was
really on TV and I just saw her work
online and I was like blown away at how
realistic it looked the portrait looked
like stickers to me and I was just like
huh so I emailed her assistant and I
said hey I want some dead beauty queens
on me I'm very into psychology and all
that realm and if I wasn't being a
makeup artist I would be a psychologist
I think which I still have time I'm kind
of young and boom
so I emailed her and I said hey I want
all these dead beauty queens tattooed on
me and they wrote back like oh my god
she would love to do that idea so we met
for the first time in 2007 I'm like oh
my god that's nine like yeah nine and a
half years ago we met which is crazy so
miss Kat Von D she put out three New
York Times best-selling books which I
happened to be in all three of them um
so I found these in my storage and I was
like oh my god like these are such cool
books so this one came out a long time
ago and it showcases the beauty queen
tattoos and oh my god look at young
Geoffrey y'all I'm dying I'm looking in
here and I'm like oh my god there's just
so many memories so the thing that kind
of struck me and like hit a nerve was I
open this book and I'm just gonna read
to you guys no tea no shade it says my
dear dear Geoffrey thanks for being a
part of this dream for me you added so
much shiny glittery life to not only
this book but my tattooing so proud to
call you a friend
that's so cool and you know it kind of
stings looking back at you know this
past summer and there's so many good
memories in this book and I'm looking at
all three of them and listen I'm not I
am NOT an emotional bitch but one came
out just a few years ago it was called
go big or go home
which was the last book that she put out
and I remember getting it from her and
opening it up and the first page I was
it kind of got me choked up and it's
like it's wild how the past you know
it's good to cherish memories and not
just focus on the negative but um to my
dearest J star thank you for always
having my back
you and your timeless beauty inspire me
every day that if you're watching this
or if you ever watch this just thank you
for covering me in some of the most
beautiful artwork that I've ever seen in
my entire life and I will always cherish
these so I think now it's time to dive
in and talk about the meaning of all
these tattoos and I'm going to show you
guys some 4k close-ups so if you have a
4k monitor or TV then hi you are viewing
me in 4k for the first time ever and I'm
excited to bring some of those videos
into my channel so let's get started I'm
gonna go in order of when I got them so
the first standout piece that you can
see is of course the three heads that
decorate the middle of my chest so from
left to right is how I got them I got
Audrey Hepburn first now if you are a
fan of my makeup line you know that I
named one of my shades Breakfast at
Tiffany's which is one of my all-time
favorite movies it is such a classic and
I just think that Audrey Hepburn is just
so timeless she is so beautiful
and I have a lot of beauty queens which
is what I call them beauty queens I'm
decorating my body and I felt like she
was such a like stunning individual back
then and she was such a star and her
brows though look at those fucking brows
I just loved her makeup and her style
that classic white in the waterline and
those lashes I died for her and I've
just been such a fan of all her movies
so I felt I had to have her on me now
the centerpiece of my entire body is
Kurt Cobain who if you don't know who
that is
I'm gonna slap you in your mouth
but he is the legendary singer of the
band Nirvana which listen huh the 90s
you guys for those of you who were born
after that hi I was there and Kurt
Cobain was such an amazing singer
songwriter just human being his
philosophies and his views on life which
is so just way ahead of its time and his
lyrics just really spoke to me and I
remember being so young and hearing
their songs on the radio and I was just
like mesmerised by his voice and so
captivated by it I don't know you know
like I think music is so cool because
they can just take you back to a place
or time or even kind of help your body
and brain articulate feelings and
emotions and Kurt Cobain definitely was
that person for me and which is this is
crazy but this summer on Warped Tour I
actually got to meet his daughter
Frances Bean Cobain and it was unreal
I'm sure she hears this all the time but
like when I was just talking to her it
was like she had the same eyes as him it
was like literally almost like looking
at him which was so like Heathrow and oh
it was it was unreal I just felt like it
was such a cool moment in time for me
and it was such a cool way to end my
summer I thought I would never meet her
I was so nervous I'm like oh my god I
have her like father tattooed on me is
that kind of weird but I'm like no this
is my like homage to someone who I look
up to and who inspired me as a kid so I
decorated um the center of my body with
him and um you know a lot of his songs
from the classic rape meet which was an
anti rape song to help girls and women
across America all the way to you know
some underground you know like demo
songs like all those songs just kind of
helped me like even grow up a little bit
as a person and just um help soothe my
soul so that tattoo definitely means a
lot to me now on the right side next to
curtain Audrey is Elvis motherfuckin
Presley who is such an icon and my mom
was such a big fan of his music so you
know when I was a baby she would play
his records a lot and I remember like
really feeling it like the Guru
his voice was so sexy and you know he is
such he's an icon I mean that's just the
word he is a legendary baby and I just
I'm just such a music lover um you know
a lot of you know me for makeup but when
I was doing music like these people
inspired me growing up and Elvis was
definitely a heavy hitter he was so cool
I love his hair his style and the fact
that still I mean there's shows in Vegas
about him there was a million like
tourist attractions involving him and
he's just he really is the definition of
legendary so I felt it was fitting to
put him next to another music icon
moving on to something a little more
light I got a double scooped ice cream
on my neck and I put the word delicious
on top of it which is funny because
years later I then got a black
Pomeranian and named him delicious so
this is not my dog's name on my neck
well it is now but that's not why I got
it so I am obsessed with sugar it has
been my addiction for a long time I love
sweets candy cookies ice cream I'm just
a dessert
whore um I just love sweets so I got
this ice cream on me and a really cool
memory was when Kat was dating Nikki
Sixx of Motley Crue which oh my god it's
a little surreal when we think about it
and I remember me and Kat were trying to
place us on my body and the word was
below the ice cream and for some reason
we both didn't like it it didn't like
fit on the way my neck was curving and I
was just kind of like oh and Nikki
actually came up with the idea to flip
it and put the word um above it and I
thought it flowed really cool on my neck
so we went with it and now it's one of
my most favorite tattoos this is my
great-grandma now this was a portrait in
the 1920s that she got taken which is it
was in black and white when she passed
away while I was in high school I was
looking through all of her stuff and I
found this picture and it was stunning
and it was so cool and her little
eyebrows and the makeup was just awesome
and I'm like girl that lipstick though
can I have that room shade I loved it so
I kept it all this time and years later
I found it
um I'm gonna put her where I can look at
her every day in the mirror quickly and
just get a reminder because she helped
me grow up as a kid and help my crazy
alcoholic mother and just it just means
something really special to me and I
love looking at it every day all right
so after all of this was done there was
a lot of kind of like empty holes where
full-face portraits would not fit so I
took inspiration from now Kat was so
good at doing roses I was like oh my god
I want similar why famous roses on me
and crazy enough I have bumblebees
tattooed on me I have a love and hate
relationship with bees now my family
we're allergic to bees like my mom had
had the EpiPens the whole nine so I this
is a funny story I've never been stung
by a bee so I know a lot of you were
like well how do you know I got tested
for you know allergies and all that shit
I am definitely allergic to bee so I've
always had a fear of them and when I see
one coming a bitch screams and runs in
the house so I wanted to embrace a few
things that I was scared of so I started
with bees like you know what they're so
pretty I love the way honeycomb looks
whether it's a pattern on a jacket or
even looking at honeycomb like when I'm
watching you know like TV and like those
crazy nature shows I just love how they
look and I love the queen bee mentality
and the hive and the insert' beyonce
joke here and everything about it
so we were thinking of you know little
things to place around me and I picked
honey and roses and bees and you see the
word honey is draped on me and I just
love the word honey I thought it would
flow really nicely with we call it the
filler in the tattoo world you know to
fill in all the gaps and just close it
off and I just thought it flowed really
nicely and I love lettering I am a
stickler for lettering so it turned out
perfect I love the way it all fell
together and once it all healed and like
became a unit I was in love moving down
my body on my left side for the ribcage
I got the entire painting of the Mona
Lisa the famous painting that everyone
knows about since I myself have no I
I always kind of felt a little bond with
her and there's also a lot of rumors
that Leonardo did then she actually
painted a man that looked like a woman
which who's ever gonna know the answer
so that now who knows but um looking
back on the history lessons there was a
lot of rumors that the painting did have
brows and then someone played a cruel
joke or even he did it himself where he
liked use the stuff that removes paint
so like they wiped the eyebrows off
later like I don't know there's so many
like myths and crazy conspiracies and
stories about Mona Lisa it's always
fascinated me and who doesn't love
seeing funny memes where the brows are
drawn on but besides that I just think
it is such a stunning
beautiful dark dramatic I'm a Scorpio
I'm into that
we talked about bees about having fear
okay that's great and all but hi sharks
is probably one of my biggest fears ever
just that feeling of being in the ocean
and something being under you
potentially is so frightening to me
besides that fear of sharks I've always
loved the movie Jaws listen one of the
most iconic movie posters in the history
of American culture and it is just such
a fucking cool movie I've probably
watched it about 50 times and I felt
like listen getting jaws in the middle
of my stomach that is brutal and I just
went for it I'm like you know what go
big or go home exactly let's roll let's
do it and it turned out fucking amazing
and it's I don't know I love it I'm
obsessed traveling to the right side of
my rib cage I have a portrait of Patrick
Bateman who if y'all don't if y'all
don't know the movie American Psycho
after watching this video please go
watch it and I'm gonna return some
videotapes it was like sexy and then he
kills much people and it's just really
psychologically dark and fucked up and
you know right up my alley now in this
video this is the only tattoo that was
not done by cat this was done by my
friend Brian Gonzalez who has a shop in
Alhambra California called ink swingers
oh my god listen in slingers is such a
fucking dope tattoo shop they've done a
lot of
work which you'll see of course in
future videos but portraits though and
black and gray they kill so hard like I
don't know like when I saw the finished
um
tattoo I was like oh my god it was so
cool and I love that Brian implemented
the red ink into the black and gray cuz
obviously black and gray is black and
gray I was like you know what I'm over
color but you know he's that but what if
we add like red for the blood and I was
like I don't know and I was so glad that
I trusted him because it looks killer
and I'm just so lucky to have even a few
Brian pieces on me because they're
unreal last but not least is Red Rum
which is right above my private area now
of course you all know the shade Redrum
from my liquid lipstick line but a lot
of you don't know the inspiration from
and I see a lot of younger people who
haven't seen the movie The Shining be
like oh like where's that from or what
is that name so if you've never seen the
movie The Shining you guys got a lot of
homework to do after this there is a
scene in the movie where Redrum starts
popping up in his son's head and they
write it on the wall with like red blood
and basically if you look at the word
backwards in the mirror it says murder
so if you guys are like okay girl red
rum means murderer backwards now you all
know Stephen King was one of my favorite
authors so of course the shining was a
book of course they made it into this
crazy movie which is very famous in the
horror um movie world so I love it and
funny tidbit is that that tattoo was
actually done before any of these so I
had um the stomach down before all the
faces so yeah BAM
alright guys thank you so much for
watching this little storytime a moment
there will definitely be part 2 3 &amp;amp; 4
