channel today I have a very special
guest hi hi we have the amazing Jordan
Hans on my channel today oh my god this
has been a long time waiting medicine
now when I first saw her channel I think
I was like almost 2 years ago and I was
just like oh my god like you guys know I
love beauty makeup I obviously
specialize in special effects or like
transformations or body paint but I have
to call in and the best and I am
obsessed with the Jordans Channel it's
unreal you guys have to check it out
everything will be linked down below but
you know we wanted to collab a few times
I know Michael Campbell Suicide Squad is
coming out it's out now it's in theaters
who's seen it I am such a fan of Jared
Leto oh yeah your bone structure works
so perfect from the movie which is a
good thing oh yeah
some people are trying to use it as an
insult I'm like Mitch Jared always
everything is gorgeous are you kidding
me like he's very get real I know me and
him kind of know each other we've met a
few times and I think that he is such an
amazing actor I mean everything from rec
room for a dream all the way to Dallas
buyers club he is so unreal but that's
having an amazing band there's a lot
he's a very you know exactly now when we
saw that he was gonna be the Joker we
were like oh my god that is so sick so
we wanted to recreate our version and
her version and give us a little tea you
look different than that you know when
we talked about it we wanted to do a
Joker makeup together obviously and we
wanted to kind of bring a little bit of
a different feel to it so we went with a
little bit of a grungy kind of beauty
look where there's a pop of silver on
the eyelids and some lashes unlike which
he is and then a little bit of kind of
some kind of dirt looking grunge and
grime you know because he's kind of a
grimy character you know
add some of that in yes and I think it
turned out so fucking dope now whether
you are a working artist or a beginner
or just a fan of makeup you are going to
enjoy this transformation and you're
gonna learn a lot of tips and tricks so
grab a Red Bull and an edible and enjoy
this video guys
so right now if you are going to be
wearing this for Halloween or for a long
period of time you will want to prime
your skin because it will hold this
makeup for much longer so you could
either use any kind of primer that's
your favorite I have the NYX color
correcting primer right now but you can
use whatever you prefer so with the RCM
a we're gonna mix the lightest
foundation shade and a little bit of
white cream paint to get that perfect
kind of Joker feel since we are doing
the full face and we are going to be
doing a little bit of the chest you want
to mix quite a bit together it's not
exactly the stark white it's kind of
like a really light foundation tone so
we're just gonna mix it together and
mixing it on the back of your hand with
cream paints is for sure the best
because the warmth of your skin will
really meld the products together a flat
kabuki brush is great to blend it all
together because it'll really get into
the skins that you have that nice full
base
and since we're gonna be covering the
hair getting right up in that hairline
will cover it anyways no big deal
a lot of people forget the ears oh yeah
beauty makeup oh my how many of your
ears are like hot red your face is like
beat to the gods
put your ear onto your neck a little bit
that is I'm leaving the eye area empty
just because the Joker's eyes are very
dark they're pretty much two black
circles so you want to leave that empty
of the white cream paint because there's
really no reason to Adam cream hate to
just add on more makeup on top
so Jeffrey obviously doesn't really have
eyebrows which is an awesome trait kind
of like that but if you do have eyebrows
you will need to cover them because the
Joker doesn't and so I already have this
nice blank slate to work off of but
it'll be great if you do just cover your
eyebrows first off and fun fact Jared
Leto did shave off his eyebrows for the
movie oh really dedicated so Jeffery
already has some really intense
cheekbones but we want to intensify them
even more because we are coined for kind
of a grungy or Joker you really want to
intensify cheekbones around the nose
around the forehead everywhere you would
normally contour it just a little more
intense so with the Joker you want to
really bring down the contour near your
mouth because that will give a very
masculine kind of hollowed feel a lot of
the time you just contour straight kind
of like you know to your mouth a little
bit if you bring that down to your jaw
line it'll really hollow out the face
I'm starting out with a little bit of a
light brown that's a very cool tone
because if you go to warm it won't look
like a natural shadow against this white
the jawline also needs to be really
intense because he has a sharp ass
jawline really darkened right underneath
you want to take in a lot of the brown
shadow right into the temples this will
again add even more of that hollowed
effect
so you want to switch to a smaller brush
just to start a little more of the
definition and the Joker's features
right around the eyes these include the
deeper for a brows the kind of eye bags
I'm using the makeup geek break-up cool
porcelain contour powder and this will
start to be kind of your transition
shade into the deep black of the eye so
you can put this right under into that
brow bone
we want to intensify jeffries features
just to match Jared Leto's in the movie
and a great tip is to use your pinkie
just to stabilize your finger to get a
nice even blend like my grandma said in
the war you better blend if any of your
work is a little patchy because we are
working on cream paint can also take
that foundation brush she used earlier
just to really blend it out by adding a
little bit more pigment on top
you would just want to start really
darkening all of your contours a little
bit of black eyeshadow could even mix it
with a very dark brown to really blend
it into the already transition shade you
put down think of it again like a smokey
eye you have your lighter brown and then
as you really darken it you add in that
deeper shade if the color is a little
too dark you can always take again that
foundation brush that you use with the
white and Pat it right on top and
that'll lighten it and blend it right
back in just like we did the larger
areas you want to darken up especially
around the brow bones because as you can
see the light as it hits the top of the
forehead it would cast a shadow
downwards into this area so you really
want to add a lot of darkness right into
here any time that we add shadow means
that the skin is receding inwards so
always take your own face into account
whenever you are creating character
makeup because character makeup always
look better if it fits your own face
they get darker the portion that you put
down basically means the deeper the
wrinkle so as the wrinkle on jared leto
and the Joker would naturally go forward
into the forehead it would get a little
lighter so you always want to have this
nice transition of dark right under here
into lighter
I'm gonna add just a little bit of color
to the sides of the nose just to match
the Joker moving on to the eyes we want
to really darken them up they're just
black hole circles with that bright blue
pop it out using a NYX black-bean jumbo
pencil to completely cover the eye
top and bottom
this can be really messy because we are
going to smoke this out anyways this is
just gonna act as our base product it's
also good to start bringing in the black
pencil to blend into these brown lines
that we already have just because that
will really intensify this dark shadow
that we have going on right here
to blend this black that we just put
down right into these features you want
to switch back to your dark brown just
that looks as realistic as possible to
smoke it out
now that the jumbo pencil is all blended
out you want to set it because it does
pretty much act as a cream it's a pencil
so if it's on the eyelid you don't want
it to crease so I want to use a super
black matte eyeshadow using the NYX
primal color and pop Blatz is definitely
one of the darkest black eyeshadows you
could use on the market if you get a
little bit of fallout it's all good so
you can just roll with it make it work
use your foundation brush kind of blend
it in you know this is a grungy Joker so
you just got to kind of roll with the
punches make it work right so since
we're doing a little bit more of a
beauty look we are going to add a little
bit of blue and a little bit of silver
pigment right into the center of the lid
the glue will make sure that it stays in
put all day long and then for the glue
we use the Too Faced a glitter glue with
a little sugar pill tiara pigment on top
which is one of my favorite Silver's so
pigmented and so so great I can see it
through my lids right now I Pat it right
in the middle of the lid and to blend it
out you just want to lightly swipe it
right into the block you technically
don't have to use a glue when you put
down this pigment but just so that it
doesn't move at all it's always great to
have that extra assurance adding just a
tiniest bit of light pigment the middle
of the eyes always seems to open them up
and brighten them now you just want to
coat the lashes and a little bit of
mascara is whichever favorite mascara
you have doing the top and bottom since
it's a beauty look we want to pop on
some lashes and what are we gonna use
today these aren't new fun some certain
Gettys these are nice and full but
they're not too full to hide the nice
pop of silver underneath since we do
have false lashes on we want to hide
that lash line just a little bit so go
ahead and add a little bit of like eye
shadow to blend that in some of the
makeup firmer flash palette I want to
mix a tiny bit of brown cream paint onto
my hand with a little bit of the
foundation we use
earlier you're going to mix that on the
back of your hand because we want to add
a little bit of a dirt effect around the
cheekbones with a stippling sponge
stippling sponges are great for adding
texture to looks so around the
cheekbones you just want to add a little
bit of texture just to really bring in a
little bit of dimension into the look
just that these eyes are perfect little
black holes these a little bit of makeup
geeks black spectrum eyeliner to coat
the waterline and obviously to get the
perfect read Joker lip we're gonna be
using Jeffery stars a red room if it
does mix with the cream paint a little
bit it will turn obvious little pink so
I can just layer that or clean it off
before him your lines don't have to be
perfect on all of your lips because we
will be manipulating the shape a little
bit to look like it was a run down
smeared just a little bit all the
lipstick is still a little wet you just
want to start rolling it down just a
little bit to smear it I'm steering it a
little bit more towards the bottom so
that's usually where lipstick
tends to smear can even use your finger
to start kind of dotting the color out a
little bit so it really looks like it's
the lipstick is super worn in so using
that black eyeliner we're just going to
draw in this little crack that he does
have right by his eyebrow that's right
forgot to apply a moisturizer this
morning damn that one that one please
since it's super intense again take that
kabuki brush and really lighten it out
right up to where it meets the forehead
just like we did earlier with the other
little wrinkles
I love asymmetrical looks so with just a
little bit of black eyeshadow it's add
in just a little bit where it almost
looks like this black eye shadow started
to run kind of get really messy you can
dab it on however you see fit and then
even use your finger or your brush to
blend it right into that cream to start
the tattoos we want to use switch to a
little bit of body paint and I'm using
my runs black body paint just because
this will stay in place and it's very
easy to use to start drying out what you
want when you are doing this on yourself
if you are remember to always do it
reverse because you are looking in a
mirror as I was looking at the J a
little bit I did realize that I needed
to kind of clean
it up a little bit add a longer top of
the jury and angular out the bottom and
we also want to clean up the side that I
did include in I want this to look kind
of angular and fierce instead of more
soft and curved and then now for damage
okay a great way to start out is to kind
of map out your starting point and your
ending point with a little bit of
eyeliner you want to try to place it
pretty much where he has it in the
picture it's decently high up near the
hairline and you wanted to see generally
about how long it would be
now we're just going to take a little
bit more of that clean beam and clean up
our lines just there nice and sharp just
to bring it all together add a little
bit more of that stippling Brown all
around the perimeter of the face on top
of the damage the signature chest
tattoos we're going to be using these
same methods we used earlier adding a
little bit cream paint and then using
some body paints to draw out the tattoos
so now we are going to do the hair I am
using a mix of we grabbed some green
hairspray that we're gonna put all over
come on wall green and then just to add
a little bit des moines more dimension
to the hair because it is natural hair I
had a little bit of street food body
paint just to finalize the look and my
hair is a fresh from the shower air dry
it's really it just like and I had in a
clip the whole time so excuse my hot
mess of a hair with no product so let's
give it a whirl
alright guys this is the final look I
just have to say I'm looking in the
monitor you fuckin slayed me I'm so glad
you liked it it was so oh my god I'm
feeling really Jared Leto ocean crimey
you got those cheekbones really feeling
that oh yeah what was the biggest
challenge of this look honestly probably
the tattoos I wanted the tattoos to look
as realistic probably the damage to be
real yeah damage though gotta get that
perfect in the cursive I haven't done
cursive since sixth grade looks really
cool and we kept a little bit of my pink
hair in there and if we're a little
grungy it's a little bit of element
since you do have some you know a little
beauty and a little money wants a little
vanity in here I just can't believe how
fucking sick this looks I am so excited
