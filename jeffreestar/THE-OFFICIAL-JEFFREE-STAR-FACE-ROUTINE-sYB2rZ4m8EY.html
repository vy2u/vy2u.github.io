channel now I have been getting so many
requests about how I do my eyebrows how
I draw them on how I do my full
foundation routine and highlight and
contour so this video is strictly just
focusing on that
how about paint the face before the rest
of the look so if you notice in my other
videos I like to fast forward to I
browse in full look so now you'll see
how I do my foundation highlight and
contour
so enjoy guys mwah alright guys before I
put on any foundation I love to prime
the skin now depending on what kind of
look I'm going for that day will
determine what kind of primer I want to
use now in previous videos you've seen
me use the Bobbi Brown vitamin face
primer I'm obsessed with this one so
this is my go-to everyday geoffery
primer now when I want a little extra
glow little extra dewy I love using the
Becca backlight priming filter this is
like magic I love using this with a
Beauty Blender if your fingers are a
little too busy with leather gloves you
just comply this right here and I'm just
going to start dabbing it around and
blending it over the entire face now as
you can already see it just gives you
that more luminescent glow
sometimes when I'm wearing no foundation
I'll just put this primer on because I
love the way it looks so now that that
is completely on it's time for 12,000
layers of foundation now my go-to every
day like for the past two years has
always been a mixture - I don't just
wear one foundation I love to mix now
the reason for that is I just like the
way things feel I love playing around
and just being at home and playing with
makeup I've discovered the masks that we
all have come to love so step one do
your air flash if you've never tried
this run to Sephora right now after
watching this and get a sample
it is like airbrush in a can and then
we're gonna follow it
with mixing on top with a Beauty Blender
the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation I am obsessed with this so
we're gonna mix these two today step 1
shake this is an airsoft foundation guys
the air flash is very versatile you can
spray it on your hand and mix with a
brush you can spray on a beauty blender
or you can just do direct which is what
we're gonna do today is we're just going
to spray around get that neck avoid my
grandma now the cool part about this
foundation is you have a little room to
let it sit for a minute without drawing
too quickly some foundations you put it
on after like 45 seconds it's like
starting to dry and you're like wait I
haven't blended everything yet this one
gives you some wiggle room and lets you
have a moment to breathe we've already
had our damp Beauty Blender and I'm just
gonna put this directly on here then I
like to kind of like dot it all over my
face so it has an even coverage not
forgetting our neck and a little on the
ears now what are we gonna do
we're gonna blend blend blend alright
now I can blend for another 12 hours but
that is the gist of it now I don't like
to do it too heavy under my eyes so when
I take my Beauty Blender I'm just gonna
soften the eyes a little bit more I like
to coat my entire face with Mac Studio
Fix and I've been doing this since like
I was 15 years old it's like my go-to
thing today we're going to take some Mac
Studio Fix and you can apply this with
anything you can use a Beauty Blender
again if you want I'm going to use this
big Tom Ford powder brush this is number
zero five and I'm just going to take
this powder and then start packing it
over my entire image
all right now we are ready to highlight
and contour so what I'm going to do here
is over the powder we've already done
and our twelve layers of foundation
we're going to take this NARS kabuki
brush Mac Studio Fix and we're just
going to take this and almost like an
upside down triangle we're just gonna
start blending it all into the skin I
like to pack in the skin so I'm not just
like brushing it on I am going into the
skin to make sure that it does not move
around I'm happy with that
now I'm going to move on to the chin
always the chin roll now because my nose
is really slender I don't want to make
it look too crazy so I'm just gonna
lightly dot a little bit down the middle
but not towards the tip is working at
contour that in a second so the first
highlighting is done now before I do
contour I definitely want to set under
my eyes I am just going to put loose
powder under there and press it in and
wipe it off and now powder that I love
to use this is a Chanel one it does have
a little bit of color to it this one is
a shade Claire now if you want no color
I love Kat cosmetics this is a
translucent powder it works phenomenal I
love using a damp Beauty Blender for
loose powder if you've never tried it
you're missing out this is amazing
it like literally melts into your skin
so you just coat the Beauty Blender and
we're just going to tap tap-tap under
the eyes now the reason fretting that
loose powder over the highlight is
because we want no creasing under the
eyes all right now we are finally ready
to contour this bitch for contouring I
am obsessed with the Kat Von D shade and
light palette as soon as this came out I
was like oh my god it's the Holy Grail
I'm going to be using the metal one
clearly uh she's been used before
let's contour first of all I'm going to
be using the Smiths cosmetics brush and
we're just going to dip into that middle
one I like to
we start blending right where that line
is and I'm just going to just start
buffing that color in and I'm going to
bring it up a little bit on my hairline
now you don't want to do it too far down
where it's like almost to your mouth and
you look crazy so you do want to stop it
at a point and I like to do it right
below my eye now I'm gonna connect the
temples in a little bit so I'm just
going to start buffing lightly up on
there all right now as these cheekbones
are settling in let's go down to the
chin now I like to have really dramatic
features so I'm going to really cut this
chin and jawline and I like to bring up
the color a little bit on the actual
part of it and start dragging a towel
and then I'm going to start creating a
shadow under the jaw so I'm going to
take the brush and do it under and just
draw it down a little bit so it looks
like like defined like hi my face is
carved out of granite how was your day
we go and do it a forehead and this is
where I'm going to take the makeup
forever brush this is really easy to use
and we're gonna go into the middle color
once again if you have a little forehead
you are gonna want to avoid extreme
contour because you're gonna look a
little wild so skip the forehead for us
big-headed hos we're gonna blend a
little more up here if we're just going
to dip into only like 25% of the brush
and I'm just gonna start blending it
down now this brush is so soft it just
kind of it worked I was like okay we're
gonna be a little innovative today now
is where I'm going to take my Beauty
Blender and soften those lines they
don't want it too harsh I like to add
shadow under my nose because I don't
want it to look like a ski slope so
we're just gonna blend and blend and
blend now if you want her contour it
should be set and not moving we're going
to go back to that Chanel powder we're
gonna take her out and this is where I'm
just gonna take this little thing and
dot it over my forehead got under my
cheeks pad on my nose notice how I
avoided the high plans of my cheekbones
because I want them to stay chiseled we
have to set this so even before I do my
eyes and eyebrows and everything else I
do like to take the little makeup
forever mist and fix and just do a
little let that set and we are done now
I've changed my highlight color every
single day um today I'm going to be
using the honest off SIA illuminator and
star light this one is really blinging
and I am hooked on it you can do the
morphe 510 which I love this guy so
let's use this one right now no you guys
know I like to pack on my metallic glow
like I want to be glowing like radiation
poisoning I want to be like twenty
thousand million stars in the sky so
let's get to glowing put it right where
that contour and a white highlight meet
and just kind of let them have a
threesome now highlighters can
accentuate your pores so that's why we
use that primer earlier I like to take
this and go all the way to the hairline
here
right so we have the cheeks done I love
to add highlight right up on my Cupid's
bow and my lips especially if you're
wearing a bold lip it just really looks
nice photos no I am NOT highlighting my
chin my jaw and literally like cut
faster than Dexter so we're gonna leave
that alone I'm gonna just put a tiny bit
on my nose right here not too crazy and
I like to add some highlighter above the
brows that we are about to draw on so
now that I've gone back over my
cheekbones sixteen thousand times the
highlight is done so let's do our brows
now it's time for the brows now I get a
lot of questions about this all the time
because I've never shown how to do my
brows before now they are come
shaving off I hand draw them on every
single day
freehand them on there is no stencils
involved there's no magic tricks it's
just practice now in 10th grade I shaved
my eyebrows off with the first time and
my mom and grandparents had a stroke and
they were like what the hell my grandpa
said I look like an alien which was I
was like I'm feeling you as god now when
I do my everyday brown brow I always use
the Anastacio brow Wiz and the dip brow
this is just my go-to everyday brow now
just start it it's really simple you
guys I just pick a spot of where I want
it today I am going to start where my
tear duct is and I always usually start
there it just depends on my height so
I'm just going to take this and go up
and I'm going to make a little dot now
this tiny dot that you probably can't
even see is like my guideline so now I'm
gonna take it and the front of my brow
is gonna be a little arch on purpose and
I just start to carve him out and when I
get to the tail I like to thin it out so
it's like ultra thin and the tail is
like high in one with me now after
I have me outline done I love to go over
the brow with Auto Stassi a dip brow now
I am in shade taupe for both and I'm
gonna go in with the Kat Von D shade +
light eye palette and I'm going to be
using this top middle shade this is a
Lazarus for the front of my brows to get
that little ombre moment that I do
just tap into here real quick and I'm
going to just back and forth back and
forth put some of the Sun now I'm gonna
go in with my dip brow a little goes a
long way so do not go overboard with
this product I am just going to start it
halfway on the brow and I just start the
nesting the jet brow into
the outline who lower that's a bitchy
brow last step is to take the mist and
fix spray one more time let that settle
in and we are done alright guys that was
the magic in the makeup now you guys
