your teeth though lose your day
what's up you guys welcome back to my
channel today this is probably one of
the most exciting videos I'm gonna film
this year I'm pretty excited about it so
today we are going to unveil the star
family collection it is something that
me and Nathan have been working on for a
few months and we just showed a sneak
peek a day or two on snapchat and
Instagram oh my god the internet is
going nuts you know we just wanted to
make something really special for like
the fans cuz you know you guys know so
much about our lives so we just wanted
to give you a little piece of it you
know so yeah and I think like I haven't
really collabed with really anyone but
Manny for my brand I am very like I'm
not against collaborations at all I just
want it to be very authentic and I think
that I don't know I wanted to do
something really special with me and
show her I love and just let you guys
know a different side of us even in this
video you're gonna see some things that
we've never shown before but I was
sitting there and I was like okay Nate
who should i collab with next and we
were throwing around some names of
influencers and then I was just staring
at him and then the dogs one of the dogs
jumped into his lap and he just went
like so cute and I was like huh what if
we did like a family collection and Nate
was like oh my god that would be so cool
I want to make my own colors and let's
do something to represent all the dogs
yeah yeah I was always fun to like play
around with the colors with you two
anyway so hell yeah
exciting so when I announced this
collaboration we just got to get this
funny part out of the way because you
know the internet always wants to try it
there was a lot of people who were
saying how can Nathan know anything
about makeup you're not gonna collab
with a youtuber or a makeup artist let
me tell you the T when you have lived
with me since I started my brand
he went from knowing nothing about
makeup to literally like everything
probably that I know right exactly we
live and breathe makeup so it's kind of
hard not to catch on everything there's
always so the brand is literally like my
entire
and it has become a really huge part of
Nathan's life so it was really cool to
bring Nathan into the lab because that's
where I spend a lot of my time creating
which there's a lot of you know a lot of
people don't get to see that side of the
creation so I said hey Nate you're gonna
get to spend a few days in the lab with
the whole Sh'ma small schmuck yeah I
don't know what I told ya the masks and
the medical outfit you have to of course
be very sanitary in the makeup labs Oh
in ferrets very strict yes so we so I
took Nathan there and we and you know we
had like a brainstorm of like okay let's
create six brand new liquid lipsticks
that represent me him and the dog so we
split our chores in half yes we did I
created three he created three but I
said hey Nate I want you to make a
Nathan lipstick like I want to wear
Nathan on my mouth right do you you
asked me you know what was like your
favorite looks and stuff like that and I
always liked like the neon and cool
colors but I always liked the nude lips
they always just look nice and feel
really well with like your foundation
and the highlights coming from my gig so
yeah I said so make a color of course
that it's not really that similar to
another shade yeah yeah so we do you the
vault I had to look through the vault
there's so many now so I asked Nathan
like hey what is your like dream color
to make for you know obviously everyone
out there to wear and me right and I was
just thinking like a terracotta nude
there was not I didn't really see much
of that color in there too much of the
new year so I was like I think you guys
need that one I am actually gonna just
ruin the surprise and I'm wearing Nathan
right now on my lips of course we're
gonna unveil all the colors and it's
like I thought that looked familiar
you're like that just my color yes I am
wearing Nathan on my mouth today feels
good right so let's break down our
collection so first things first the
velour liquid lip box set comes like
this BAM this is the Barbie house and
that's what I'm calling it this
literally represents our house our
entire house is pink now when I met you
you knew everything was gonna be pink
right yeah I figured as much
you don't care no I really don't mind
the color pink so it's fun so our entire
house
instead of a cupcake so we wanted to
represent that with this and this
definitely is a tea different definitely
does it pretty well yes this collection
will be launching on October 21st yes it
will be launching at 10:00 a.m. Pacific
Standard Time our normal time which is
1:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time and if
you don't know every time don't baby you
better google it alright so inside the
house let's open her up now first things
first before we show the colors inside
there are me and Nathan's personal
signatures and all four of our dog's
paws yes they are real now this picture
look at me is my pink hair now for those
of you who do not know makeup takes like
months to make like the production of
the packaging and everything so we took
this a few months ago and we also
recreate it recently so besides that
let's get to the damn shades everyone's
like let's go right you see that right
so here are all the colors that we're
gonna go from left to right and then the
bottom so first up we have
Nathan's color of course you guys see
it's on my mouth so there is this
beautiful warm tone peachy nude
I love this color definitely something
that I did not have already so I'm so
happy with this color when we said when
he was a cave I think this is the final
out I put it on and I was like yes
Nate's little nickname for me and what a
lot of you guys have called me is the
wifey we get asked if we're getting
married every single day yes we do maybe
soon maybe one day so wifey is a
gorgeous darker red it's like unicorn
Bloods stepsister yes
yeah a corn red-room mixed together yeah
it's like a hybrid I love this red it is
definitely more of like a dark brick
sexy red definitely darker than Red Rum
but lighter than unicorn blood now we
are going to move on to the dogs so when
we sat here and thought about all the
shades we thought about like the dogs
entire history my first two dogs diva
and diamond I had before me and Nate
ever started dating and then delicious
and daddy yeah we got
when we first started dating so about
six seven months in we got delicious
yeah it was he was the cutest little
it's crazy too because he was like
almost brown before he turned black
which was like the craziest thing yeah I
met like a really light but kind of dark
almost like a grizzly bear yeah he
really did look like a little grizzly
yeah okay so we're gonna talk about the
dogs you guys and then we're gonna
swatch one that will go down each color
and we'll talk about all the dogs so
first up is Deva Deva has been every
color of the rainbow now I got Deva you
guys eight years ago long time which is
nuts
so I never so growing up I always had
cats Nate has yeah I've had three four
cats plus dogs you know we've had birds
or everything a lot of animals so I used
to have a lot of cats when I was growing
up at my grandma's house and when I oh
not to be dark but one of my cats from
three years old to 14 years old I had to
put down which is so horrible I know a
lot of you out there can relate and it
broke my heart oh and I like about to
never get animals again right it sucks
fast forward to when I used to sing and
go on tour I was on Warped Tour actually
2009 and we're in Indianapolis we were
out in like the country like just seeing
the city we had a day off and there was
like this random like pet farm in the
middle of nowhere oh wow
and we went there and I was like you
know what it might be time to get animal
like I really want a dog I never had
dogs growing up but they're so loving
and caring and amazing and they're just
like I was ready at that time in my life
to get a dog so insert diva now all the
dogs are Pomeranians except diva I'm
sure a lot of you were like why is diva
like the Jumbo version of them and why
does his face longer pointy snow yeah so
diva is actually he has Fox blood in him
as well as full Pomeranians so he is
very unique and at first I didn't
believe the guy he said well a fox had
sex with a dog and maybe he lied right
the folks came in to like their barn or
whatever where they had all their palms
and you know yeah you know so I don't
know if the guy was lying I mean every
vet is like yeah that's crazy and they
never say he's anything else
so if Fox sperm doesn't work with dogs
let me know in the comment section below
now let's talk about Deva shade now we
know I have a hot hot pink in this brand
prom night this is prom nights Barbie
sister it is a more warmer pink and if
you look closely at the swatch and in
the bottle it has gold metallic in it
it's so pretty now I can see it really
closely yes I love the shade it is so
stunning if I used to be paint that was
his signature color and when we did it
him pink he blew all over the internet
like so people used to write articles
about it and people would go crazy about
me coloring the dog somebody has their
everyone has their opinion yeah the dye
is not dye it is basically vegetables it
is a vegan formula that coats the hair
kind of like this this is actually vegan
dye your I guess I can lick his hair
right and the thing is the dogs think
it's like shampoo it's like you're
washing the dog with shampoo and they
don't even a lot of misconception
chemicals anybody's eyes or mouth or
anything like that that's but anyway so
long story short I always received a lot
of crazy stuff about my dogs I'm sure
you guys have seen a lot of old pictures
of them we're gonna throw up a few so
dearly used to be pink he's been spotted
as you know this picture and he's done a
lot of stuff so I thought that would
represent him perfectly
now next shade is diamonds diamond is uh
we call her miss thing in this house she
runs the house she does now diamond is a
pure white Pomeranian boy yeah boy palm
she is a show dog just like delicious
and daddy and I a man used to be
periwinkle and I used to kind of be
inspired by like aliens and
extraterrestrials and like Sailor Moon
so cool and there is this famous picture
of diamond let's throw it up right here
of her being periwinkle and she has a
little bindi on her hand yeah she is a
little people you thought it was the
craziest yeah it was a tiny sticker
that lit when I like waiting I thought I
was like what the hell sick wasn't heavy
it was like air I didn't even know it
was on there no people like but you know
how people are yeah animals are not toys
I know they're my family I know but
anyway you guys so this famous picture
of diamond went viral all over the
Internet
and I thought you know what what better
way to match that shade I don't have a
periwinkle color in my collection at all
it's a really pretty color and I really
love how it looks with the baby pink you
this is a little history lesson everyone
so diamond I got her a year later after
diva so she is now seven Diamond has
something called alopecia which if
anyone has watched Real Housewives of
Beverly Hills Lisa Vanderpump's dog
Ziggy I think that's his name they don't
watch TV okay so Lisa Vanderpump's dog
has alopecia as well and she always put
sweaters on him I didn't know she had
that so imagine you guys we have this
dog totally normal and then her help
isn't effective thank God
well imagine baby three years in yeah
what happened all her hair started
falling out I was so freaked out I was
like to shave cancer yeah she's dying
does she have like some crazy skin
disease I had no idea that's so crazy
um and one day there was a clumps of
hair on the carpet and I was like so
scared so I took her to a dog
dermatologist now girl back then when
when mama had no coin that doctor was so
much money but I was like vets in
general are that and especially like
tests like that it's so yes it was close
mostly so I took her to a dermatologist
and they diagnosed her with alopecia
black actually that's what it's called
he said there isn't like a hundred
percent cure but there's medicines you
can give her to make the hair grow back
right and I'm like oh my god like I
don't care how she looks but she's a dog
she wants she wants a hair she's gonna
be cold they gave her some medicine and
it was a certain type of medicine it's
actually for human cancer patients and a
month later white fuzz bomb yeah and
then months later her hair all came back
mostly in her belly lot its splotchy in
the back of her legs and her but it's
splotchy but anyway long story short
that's my dog's medical history I'm sure
a lot of you out there I've seen
alopecia dogs or maybe even have one let
me know in the comment section down
below
she's great hair coming back yeah verse
two nun is amazing she's in full health
I haven't dyed her hair since all of it
came back yeah I feel like it's not
that's like a bad omen
dai did nothing wrong to her obviously
we've dyed them all I just always wanted
not every buck with it because I feel
like she's been through enough right
it's just harder to grow our hair back
so it just it's harder for her to get
rid of the pink exactly that is why
diamond is this color that is her little
history she's the best thing ever she
runs the house she has a little attitude
and daddys obsessed with her yes he is
what shade is next so next shade we have
here is delicious yeah and delicious his
little back story is you know after like
about a couple months of us dating
wicker we were getting you know more and
more serious
so we thought you know maybe we'd get a
another poem yeah get another child a
little baby poem so I've never really
had baby Pomeranians and puppies and I
was really excited so yeah I was totally
down to get a little baby poem a lot of
people always have the kind of stigma
that Pomerania really yappy and crazy
and they do and mine Nate was surprised
because Deva and diamond were like
military like oh yeah they were really
because I worked in a pet store so I
dealt with a lot of different types of
dogs and they were never really my
fondest breed of breeds so you know Maya
neuromas yeah women exactly I love the
dogs so we got delicious and we wanted
to get like the opposite of diamond so
we asked each other what color do we
want to get and we wanted a pure black
one so when we found delicious he was so
cute we're gonna throw some baby
pictures of him right now look out tiny
used to be used to fit in the little
palm of our hand and he was a little
head though he had a big for it and then
he finally grew into his body yeah but
um so at the time when Nate first moved
to LA after we had been dating for like
nine months and nine ten months right
I'm like that yeah so before the house
we live in now that we buy I lived in
another smaller home but I had a lot of
stairs it was like this three level
really cool like I could we used to call
it the tree house yeah hanging on the
side of the mountain had a bunch of
stairs so that when the dogs are little
you guys they were freaked out yeah it's
but delicious him being so so tiny it
was really hard for him he was always
whining every time we got to stairs he
would never
Julie go down the stairs yeah he would
cry yeah you cry you cry just like a
little baby
but as Lynn started to grow a little bit
and yeah Nate taught him how to walk
yeah cutest thing ever after watching
that I was like you know what maybe we
will adopt a baby
just kidding haha it was really adorable
the way they like bonded and yeah to
show him how to walk down the stairs he
couldn't do it it was really cute yes so
that you know delicious has a special
place in our heart so when we were
thinking of making the color we all know
I already have a pitch black guy
recalled weirdo so that was out of the
picture that was already out of the
picture so we thought okay what else and
then Nate reminded me that when
delicious was so here's the thing you
guys Pomeranians have two coats yes not
for two coats and when they're babies
they go through like the puppy uglies is
what Maureen like readers called it they
said there's baby fur that they have
yeah so when his first runner to grow in
it was mixed of like like that grizzly
bear Charlie yeah Charlie there's like a
dark chocolate but it was like so fuzzy
it almost looked like it was tan I can't
you know it's hard to explain it it was
weird basically looked like this color
yeah it really did and we thought you
know what we got a given homage to his
it's like when a baby's eyes turn colors
when it's a green in a turn hazel when
they grow up that's kind of what happen
to his hair no delicious's personality
he he's been mouthing one yeah he's the
peppy little spit when anyone comes
up to the door if there's a package
about to be delivered or the mailman's
here or someone's walking he is the
alarm he's gonna let you know let's move
on to the sixth and final color
obviously this was gonna be a little
bump in the road because we already have
a shade called daddy yes we do now you
all know the top-selling of many MUA
jeffree star cosmetics collaboration
shade daddy which is almost sold out so
if you wanted don't sleep on it we
thought well he is the youngest and he
is a baby so baby still yeah so we
wanted to name the shade baby daddy
works perfect I think it's perfect now
daddy is a woops table Pomeranian yes he
is that long beautiful hair it almost
looks like a wig yeah okay it's nicer
hair than everybody in this house I feel
like hey
he has the most beautiful coat yeah when
he plays in the yard I mean it's just
flowing in the wind yeah it's very so
this is a more of like a nude caramel
it's really rich and it's soft it's
almost like a diet posh spice but a
little more warm toned in there daddy is
Nathan's that's Nathan's kid he's like
my my star child tell everyone why when
Danny was a puppy I would sleep with him
downstairs on the couch almost every
night so we would sleep together tell
you what every single night let me tell
you why because our bed is ginormous
it's too big it's literally eight feet
by 10 feet I'm a little baby palm is too
big so we do have stairs that go up to
our bed yes all the dogs sleep with us
daddy including now cuz he's longer he's
longer arms arms and limbs now but all
three dogs are accustomed to sleeping in
our bed yeah
so when daddy was little he was not
about that no I feel upstairs it was
Jeff he couldn't get up a still yeah and
then he would cry on the floor and you
know it's it's it's really like having a
little baby so it's like you know if we
would go to sleep he would cry and I
know a lot of people gonna make well you
have to crank train em and you have to
do girl let us raise our dogs that we
want to raise our daughter yeah I mean
we been in the same version I just slept
on the couch and it was much closer to
the floor much closer to him and he was
a lot more calm and can go right to
sleep and he wouldn't cry and keep us up
at night but in turn he is now obsessed
with me yes he did everywhere Nate walks
he follows me he was already in this
room while we've been filming this
entire video until right now we took a
little water break and he's probably
right outside the door he most certainly
probably is let's go grab him yo me too
yeah right he's a little sleepy oh look
at that hair I need look at him he was
like what are all these lights and he's
like it's bright in here Danny look
grumpy look at him he is so grumpy he's
like dad you don't like all the lights
he isn't like all the lights and he's
not a big person I'm being held he likes
being in full control when daddy that I
mean well then Nate sometimes um daddy
hates being held high the other dogs
don't care you can cradle them like
infants he has a little attitude about
it it's on the ground though he's always
all smiles but I think with ten beauty
lights he's like
girl and he just woke up in his welcome
up first but daddy is the best hair on
earth okay so I'm sure everyone's gonna
be asking what is the price for the
house so you get all six full-size of
liquid lipsticks in this beautiful
packaging for $75 you save a lot of
money buying them all together but we
want to note that you can also buy all
six shades individual individually of
course for the standard $18 price so if
you only want a few other colors you can
definitely do that
so besides that you guys there are a few
more products that we wanted to create
you know we can't just do a lipstick we
have to do some more yeah we you know I
love lip scrubs so I was like hey let's
make a few lip scrub let's get one going
so the velour lip scrubs you guys they
of course are vegan they are edible they
are infused with the vitamin E and aloe
vera you never use anything on your lips
ha before no no I never I'm never really
done did any but now lip scrub you have
a daddy here on you all right so let's
talk about our flavors you guys let's
unbox so I was really excited to create
my dream flavor so I mean I think we're
both pretty obsessed with this flavor
but we're obsessed with breakfast food
yes so Nathan goes pancakes and syrup we
had to do it I'm all about that
breakfast food baby listen when I tell
you this is identical to like Cracker
Barrell that's my favorite spot in
Michigan to go eat breakfast Cracker
Barrel pancakes in your mouth this is it
oh my god sorry I might even give me
that no your gate is so yummy it's like
maple syrup and like dough is just
melting in your mouth it is so yummy
I was like damn that's a really good
idea and so unique from my usual type of
flavors so pancake syrup baby now we'll
talk about my flavor that I just made
now this one you guys is just very
Jeffrey it's very mean you know I'm
obsessed with sweets and sugars so I
thought okay what kind of flavor do I
want to make and mine is drumroll peach
popsicle oh so good it is so yummy and
delicious and I'm obsessed with it it
tastes so good I might
just for dinner later so of course you
know I had to do the baby orange sugar
you're a fan of anything peach this is
like a like classic peach right there it
is it's like almost like a peach Jolly
Rancher on your tongue just melting away
mm-hmm all right you guys our final
product is a blinding skin frost and yes
I am wearing it today I'm sure a lot of
you were like what the hell's on your
cheeks this is a beautiful it's like a
pink purple icy hybrid like they just
had a baby look at that color Oh blimey
so me and Nate went to the lab that
makes my highlighters and we laid out
all the shades I already had and Nate
was like well my favorite is princess
Kai and I was like okay well let's make
a Nathan version of that color and you
love pinks and purples on me right
they're very pretty I like the way that
pop fluorescent yeah so we thought what
do we name it we had so many names I'm
like - wait his name it Nathan do i name
it I don't know so it was floating
around all over the internet when we
first started filming and people
combined our names and and kept calling
us an F rate which I thought was so
funny I was like I heard somebody yell
at one time and I was like what is so
genius it's like we died yes we have
been called so many nicknames and nefra
was such a big one I was like I heard
somebody yelling at me one time and I
was like cool so when we thought about
this project I was like okay me and
Nathan have been telling our
relationship and our story online now
for all mean Oh like two years now over
and I looked on my channel and me and
Nathan all the reviews we've done
together and the lifestyle videos and
they're traveling our videos have like
to hunt like over 200 million views and
I was like oh my god this is crazy
it's nuts right that's crazy a lot of
money baby so I thought you know what
we're gonna do an effort you guys have
called us that for a while now and so it
had to be it it did so of course this is
the color on my cheeks I'm gonna let me
just watch it on you yeah let's do it
Nathan worked for the photo shoot it
looked so cool on it and did being you
look at the Kendall with it yeah
actually could actually agree with you
literally ready for this so here's a
here's a clean brush covered like BAM
right so of course you can tap off if
you want or go directly on and turn this
way baby there you go let's swatch net
free on my baby look at that oh it's
like a pinky purple diamond just landed
on your face did not need that
many times but I like to really finesse
it into the skin so it just like lives
and breathes with you oh that's Belinda
come on plastic fantastic and of course
the retail price for the skin frost is
our and normal $29 I just want to add
more to my skin is that bad look at my
nose only that is the entire collection
