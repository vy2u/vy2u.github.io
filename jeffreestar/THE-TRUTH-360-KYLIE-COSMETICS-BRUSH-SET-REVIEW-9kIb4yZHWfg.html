channel hi how are ya today we are gonna
dive into the infamous Kylie cosmetics
brush set bitch the whole internet is
fucking shook to the ground and I have
never seen this much controversy go down
in the makeup world in a long time so
when the whole world is talking about
makeup brushes you got it you got to
wonder what the fuck is going on around
here so today we are going to dive into
what is the most talked-about beauty
product in a long time and of course it
is the Kylie cosmetics full brush set
now we all know by now that this baby
will retail for three hundred and sixty
dollars now oh praise the Lord so jesus
take the wheel we're gonna give this a
go now of course you guys know me I am
always down to be brutally honest I
don't know about other people on YouTube
but I do know that I am one of the only
people that has never been paid to say
that I like something and I am someone
who just keeps it a hundred percent
blunt I don't give a fuck if you're
famous I don't give a fuck of your brand
in the drugstore since I've been doing
makeup for about 20 years now yes I
started when I was 12 years old baby so
I think I know about makeup brushes and
I also manufacture and create makeup and
brushes and I know the real cost of
everything so the truth is about to be
unveiled so if you want to know what the
hell the T is on these brushes then keep
on watching
alright so of course this is a first
impressions video I have never seen or
touched these and I know these brushes
are probably out now by the time that
this video is live so this is what the
brushes come in now I don't feel like I
have to do a disclaimer every time I do
a comment but I am gonna say this once
and I'm gonna say it once only
everything I say here is just my
thoughts of course if you don't like me
already I don't know why you can click
on this video but most of you already
know what is up and I'm sorry that I
have to keep reiterating this stuff but
girl the internet is vicious
so let's unravel this and I'm just gonna
keep it gangster okay for 360 dollars I
am very curious why this is I call it
vegan leather it's like a plastic faux
leather it's obviously not real this
does feel very cheap so I'm gonna
start the review off by saying this
feels like it's from the Dollar Tree
just being fucking a hundred percent so
as you open this up there are all the
brushes to me the silver kind of dinky
packaging is not doing it for me
the brushes themselves I do like the
packaging I think the silver on the
actual brushes are cute they do look a
little basic looking I do like silver
and chrome and that type of stuff of
course
but overall am i wowed by this packaging
no I'm not this overall just feels a
very cheap yeah
but Arthur brush is good of course I
haven't even touched them yet so we are
going to do that right now but first
impressions what do you guys think of
course you're gonna sound off in the
comments below while you're watching
this but are we living for the packaging
it almost looks like like I don't know
I'm like looking at this like tin foil
it looks like the shit they did in signs
when they were like look once you get
past the packaging all the brushes of
course are displayed here and here is
where I think it gets a little weird now
when these brushes were unveiled of
course the whole internet I had to
explode and really go in about the price
points Kylie actually tweeted some stuff
out so I do want to read those really
quickly I'm going to throw those up on
the screen and we're gonna just do a
quick little paraphrase there was an
extreme backlash to the price of course
not just my opinion there was thousands
and thousands and thousands of people
questioning why there was so much money
so she tweeted out and I'm gonna throw
them up right here I have developed for
you guys the most amazing luxury brushes
ever I am very excited real brushes
don't compare to synthetic brushes
different performance quality everything
I am a hundred percent down to do an
entire synthetic line in the future
which will ultimately be cheaper okay
then she goes on to say I always fight
for the lowest price on all my products
here are some other real brush lines for
reference few references artistes which
I have right here in my hand
she also references Kevin of Kwan which
I have right here in my hand and I was a
little shook I got to be honest I'm like
okay I'm gonna read that to you guys one
more time I always fight for the lowest
price on all my products what is there
to fight about if it's your brand you
choose the price that they're sold at so
these brushes obviously I didn't make
them I don't know how much they actually
cost to manufacture I do know that when
you manufacture brushes the mark-up can
be very high depending on your brand so
is the price justified of course I'm
gonna test them on my face and see how
they perform but I don't know you guys I
don't think that these brushes cost that
much to make I mean let's just keep it
gangster here so a little history lesson
Kevin
is an iconic makeup artist in the 90s he
put out books that have changed the
entire makeup game and he is a very
iconic and he's a legend so I am a
little I'm a little peeve that someone
who has had a makeup line for such a
short amount of time is comparing
themselves to an iconic legend girl you
better chill also artiste brushes we all
know these guys you've seen a million
youtubers use these for foundation these
are very pricey as well but she's
comparing her brush set to these
companies and also Mac Mac is legendary
baby they have been around for so long
and with all the problems that her brand
has had thus far I was a little shook at
the price point of course alright so I'm
gonna do a soft a little look today and
try out some of these brushes now there
is a lot here I can't use every single
one but you guys know after about five
or six brushes you know an opinion so
first of all let's prime our face since
this brush set cost so damn much let's
use a primer that cost so damn much and
this is the Gucci Gucci face silk
priming serum okay so we are just going
to do a few pumps all right there now
normally I would use a synthetic brush
to apply this there isn't one here so
I'm just gonna use what is this one
number seven alright so I'm just gonna
take this on my hand and we're just
gonna put this all over our face
all right I am primed and ready for some
foundation now of course if you use a
synthetic brush your brush hairs will
not look like this and this is not like
a negative so don't take this the wrong
way anyone but like you see the bristles
sorry no my back drops a little bright
and they're just really wet so if you
wanted to use this brush for anything
else you're gonna have to clean it or
let it dry which some people don't like
anyway moving on and that was brush
number seven as I said let's move on to
foundation so brush number six is what I
would use for this also way I gotta say
one thing you guys for some reason and
maybe because this was a PR thing I
don't know if customers are gonna get
this in the mail but the brushes are
like stuck on with little stickers on
here I want to show this off because
it's just so weird so you pull the brush
out and you see that right there
so these are like little stickers they
almost feel like glue see that but like
that weird tacky thing the brushes are
like stuck on so when you pull them out
they have these like stickers on the
back if you guys can see that so I move
that closer so they have these little
circles that are stuck and maybe that
was just the PR cuz they were like
rolled out but that is a little weird
and then you have to sit there and like
scrape the glue off which who the fuck
wants to do that after paying that much
money
mat me so a foundation brush let's put
on some foundation now where did that
brush go alright so number six is right
here and this is a nice domi brush to
really apply the foundation and let it
hopefully sink into the skin just going
with a little Dior forever we haven't
used that in a minute now I like to mix
zero ten and zero twenty so we are about
to do that right now and that is good
for now so we dot this all over like I
normally would do I'll do half my face
right now just so we can see what the
hell's going on now let's apply
all right you guys so first impression
that's taking me a little longer than
normal to apply the foundation of course
you see a little shedding here which I
already told you guys natural hair does
shed is not the end of the world these
are of course brand new brushes so as
you can see the foundation looks
beautiful now the brushes do feel soft
is it the softest thing I've ever felt
in my life as everyone keeps asking no
it's not but it is a soft brush it is
nice obviously you see the foundation
applied great I do gotta say though when
you apply foundation with a natural
haired bristle brush it does take longer
for some reason because the product is
soaking in you got to finesse it into
the skin so I will be going in with more
pumps usually I can get that foundation
to cover my entire face I am having a go
on with even more product so just know
that and let's finish all right you guys
the foundation is a laid definitely took
a lot longer than normal my wrist is let
go Jesus I have a little bit of
foundation left but I used a lot of it
so I'm gonna wipe that off so I don't
accidentally get that all over myself
oh let's move on to concealer now I've
been loving the all-nighter Urban Decay
waterproof concealer we're gonna use
that this is what makes dad used on me
and my transformation video last week so
let's just put some on real quick all
right
BAM alright so there's that concealer
now there is I think a concealer brush
here as well so if you're someone that
uses concealers and pots or you just
want to paint it on you definitely can
do that this is a concealer brush it's
also used for blending in the concealer
which I don't normally do with these
tiny of brushes let's go in with this
for a second
we're already hating it no I'm just
kidding but I would never apply my
concealer with this brush I would maybe
paint it on but as you see this is not
blending so going on to the brush that
we used earlier we've dusted her off
let's go in this one and see how it
wants to look
I know this is a video dedicated to the
brushes but I also want to throw in a
few ideas of maybe doing some
comparisons because no one has done that
yet they've just only tried the brushes
now obviously you can see my concealer
it's alright I'm not like living for it
it did blend out I just feel like it
could have been better and quicker
that's just my opinion now I think that
it looks alright it's blending cute but
I'm like finessing it over and over I'm
over it but I do want to pull out on our
teeth brush just for shits and giggles
so here is one of their brushes what is
this one this is the oval 7 now these
are of course our synthetic man-made
fibers a lot of fibers in these bristles
and we're gonna just try it out on this
side for fun I think it's very
interesting that they say on their
website that synthetic or man-made
fibers are manufactured and therefore
can be more controlled in terms of shape
finished diameter length and strength
now with animal hairs animals produce
different hair depending on your diet
the environment the weather so there is
no consistency from one animal to
another from one season or time of year
to another never thought of that
ok artis work so I am just going to
apply the concealer on the other side
just to see if it looks better worse or
what my thoughts are so let me put on
the exact same amount of concealer all
right
here is of course the artists concealer
side blend it out and then here is the
Kylie cosmetics side not that big of a
difference I definitely think this one
obviously went on way quicker and it
just kind of blended out nicely where
this side it did blend it just looks a
little patchy and maybe like yeah look
dry for some reason like the brush hair
was like okay baby okay all right you
guys concealer of course needs to be set
I didn't put the concealer everywhere
where I wanted to so I am going to just
dab a little bit on my chin or I
normally would maybe a little bit right
here make this nose fucking I was
looking her other brushes like should I
try the foundation brush we're just used
for a laugh let's do it okay blend it
out a little better I almost felt like
the hair was like dragging the
foundation or tiny bit but definitely
worked better than that smaller brush
and this one these two are not for
concealer girl mm-hmm we definitely need
to set the concealer so I would just use
a big fluffy powder brush let's see
number three looks cute this big dome
one and then today we are going to use
which I'm excited about the new Patrick
Starr MAC Cosmetics collaboration
setting powder and this is in shade
Patrick's powder I have not used this
yet so I am very excited as you see it's
brand new
all right oh I love that Patrick put
this as the sealer instead of those
cheap clear ones that you have to like
scratch off with tweezers and you just
want to like throw the patter across the
room I really appreciate this peel-off
it's the little things right so I took
some of the powder and I put it on here
and I'm just gonna take this brush and
dip it in Oh a lot goes on here so let's
shakes them off and then I'm just gonna
literally take it and press it under the
skin not under on top of the concealer
sorry on the skin
whoa okay Patrick I see you girl
so from this side to this side I'm like
okay the setting powder is not fucking
playing right now the brush of course is
soft
I think it's applying the powder pretty
good let's keep going
all right setting powder is on concealer
is set this so far I'm definitely a fan
of can't wait to film with it again
now this brush was cute back to the Ruby
of course it applied that powder very
nice I mean you guys it's setting powder
it should apply a really nice and easy
so so far all right girl
okay I forgot one step which is good
because I'm gonna try out this big
powder brush this is number brush number
one and this is what she looks like here
I'm just gonna dust over some powder
foundation all over my entire face for a
final setting I'm gonna go in with the
lemare new sheer pressed powder which I
love and we're just gonna put this all
over at my entire face alright that is
all over the skin it looks very pretty
now this brush was um very soft it felt
nice and the powder definitely went in
all over the skin very nice so alright
brush this one is not bad at all I love
it it's very fluffy alright so I'm gonna
be the little devil over here on my
shoulder yes this brush is nice it's
fluffy it applied the powder great but I
also have one that is literally a tenth
of the cost that could do the exact same
thing so take that for what it is let's
move on now we're gonna pull out the
lemare bronzer which I love this is my
new favorite and we are going to do a
little bit of contouring and we are
gonna use what number is this brush
number five this is the contour brush
let's go into the bronzer of course oh
that picked up a lot of pigment which is
great because you know I want fucking
chiseled cheekbones so there we go
all right so something that I really do
want to point out here is that goat hair
is great for powders and as you can see
bitch it looks cute so now we're just
gonna chisel this jaw a little bit
alright now we are going to take the
skin brush and I'm gonna do a little bit
on my forehead now to me I would use a
different brush for this so maybe I
should do that
this brush number two maybe let's try it
let's do the forehead with this one but
definitely worked cute on the forehead
now I'm gonna do a little comparison how
I would do my bronzer or contour on the
forehead I would use a big fluffy brush
like this this is from Marc Jacobs
Beauty now we all know their brand is a
little pricey as well so I'm not
comparing the price I'm just comparing
that this is actually a synthetic and
remember Kylie said that real versus
synthetic is the drastically different
but at the end of the day baby you
forgot to mention that some synthetics
can be very high-quality and this feels
like butter this is for someone that's
like really on the go and you just want
to like put something on really quick
you can just kind of dust this over your
cheek bone area if you don't want the
chiseled Geoffrey cheeks but this is
really good for warming up the skin very
quickly you know no offense but
synthetic versus a real hair if this
feels pretty similar so my face is
looking a little dull we need some
highlighter now in the brush set I'm
going to assume the fan brush which is
number nine that this is a highlighter
brush as well as this other little dome
looking one number eight I use brushes
like this to apply my highlight as we
all know let's pull out what I normally
would use I love this Kevin a Kwan brush
for highlighter it's amazing it's very
domi and this is a synthetic of course
so let's see how this one performs today
what are we gonna do you guys let's use
let's use the Pat McGrath skin fetish in
shade gold fine gold excuse me so let's
take brush number eight and let's go in
there
and round and let's see what this looks
like all right so this applied alright
I'm not like obsessed with it I am gonna
do a synthetic on the other side because
that's just what we're gonna do here so
here is the cabinet Quan so let's go in
here with the same amount of product
that we did with the Kylie one alright
how are we loving at you guys here's
this side and then here is this side I'm
trying to look in the monitor it's hard
to tell cheeks are looking cute now
let's take the fan brush of course this
was the other one that I was gonna
assume was for highlighting let's go in
to that product and then let's try our
key Pizza bow of course
okay now that one put it right on the
top of the lid ooh okay I think I like
how the fan brush is applying it way
better than this other one I'm not
really sure what this is supposed to be
for but I was just trying to compare it
to you know similar brushes definitely
think that this apply is a lot better
than this one all right so let's try out
some of these eye brushes we have four
right here sorry they're sticking
together from a weird glue shit in the
package I'm like over it I hate it all
right so we're gonna take some of these
brushes and see what kind of look we can
create today I want to eat someone
else's palette because it's like why not
let's grab the hood of beauty desert
desk palette this one is very cute let's
open her up and I am just going to take
brush number 12 which is this guy right
here it's a little Packer shader brush
alright so I'm gonna go in with desert
sand right here and yes the bristles
picked up a lot of product so let's see
if it works all right now we're gonna go
in with the eyeshadow brush number 15
this is a shader brush what shade should
we do let's do a few here let's first
start with shade Eden it is this
gorgeous peachy shade of right there and
I love using this as a transition shade
it's very soft and pretty for those
moments when you just want to be a
subtle ho
though the shade Eden is blending in a
really cute love how it's looking it's
very soft and dainty moving on let's see
what other brushes we can try here we
have a little pencil brush we have a
little Packer brush there's also this
little angled one at number 11 it looks
like this let's try her out right here
so we're gonna dip into this shade amber
right here dust a little off and then
let's just go in here for a second and
see how we don't look all right so now
I'm gonna dip in I'm gonna go back and
with this brush right here and dip in to
eat in and a little bit of blazing
barely right there and I'm just gonna
take this and run this under my lash
line because I am gonna do a soft look
today alright now we're gonna go in with
this packer brush this is number
thirteen and we're gonna do a little bit
of something on the lid here you know I
don't know if you're supposed to use
like a setting spread with these in here
let's just try it without it so let's
see how this is gonna look on the lid
okay this color has to be sheer because
what the fuck okay not sure about that
shade it is very sheer I am gonna do a
little mac fix+
on the brush and let's see if it sticks
better okay there's the effect mommy
needed we're going to take the number
sixteen brush which is a pencil brush
and we're just gonna do a little bit on
the lash line and that should wrap up
trying and B brushes now I'm gonna go
with this shade over here it's called oh
you D I'm not gonna even try to
pronounce that so there we go
oh yes
all right the Ilyich is done I'm gonna
quickly pop on some liner and some
mascara and I will be right back
all right you guys the eyes are done now
I do need a lip on so I'm gonna go in
with the dirty peach Kylie lip kit one
of my favorite shades that she's created
it love it now something that's a little
weird to me is that in this entire brush
say there is no lip brush no no a lot of
you may say Jeffrey
that's what lip liners and wands and
liquid lips are for which I am so down
for that but if you are like the queen
of lips and you're pumped up lips have
gotten you this far girl where's the
damn lip brush that's all I got to ask
and I know that she just launched normal
lip sticks today which a lot of people
like to paint them on other people
clients so there's no lip brush in them
brush set which is a little weird so
anywho I am just gonna go in with this
shade right here dirty peach and let's
put it on
all right dirty peaches on it looks
we're really pretty with the eye very
monochromatic of course we're gonna do a
little all-nighter Urban Decay finish
spray mm-hmm Oh one for the Holy Ghost
all right you guys I think it is time to
give my final thoughts all right you
guys I know this has been a very
controversial topic but I definitely
wanted to see what all the hype was for
myself so thank you for watching today's
video now my final thoughts are are
these brushes jeffree star approved
they're not let's just keep it really
fucking real right now these brushes are
not Jeffrey Stehr approved now here's
the to you guys a lot of them did work
their brushes so hey thank God some of
them worked a lot more so than others
let's just go down the line here and
then I'm gonna say my real real final
final thoughts powder brush was great
foundation brush I felt like I took way
too much time doing my face and I was
just dying for a Beauty Blender I'm
saying with a concealer did not love
this at all for this or this definitely
the artiste brush
came in and wowed me the eyeshadow
brushes the contour the highlight those
went on really pretty more so this one
than the others but overall for 360
dollars plus tax and plus shipping there
is no way in hell I'm gonna recommend to
my audience that you guys buy basically
a $400 brush set that you cannot touch
or feel because of course she's only an
e-commerce brand so you are gonna take
the risk if you do want to buy these of
are they gonna work for you or not now
of course I can recommend to you a lot
of other affordable brands I know some
people think that's shady I just think
that it's smart and fair for you guys
because this brush set with this cheap
old vegan aluminum fucking silver is
just not worth the price point I
definitely think that you are paying for
an overhyped celebrity name and the
price I know we're all just like the
price I just don't think it's worth it
now I know that these are real hair and
all that but my advice Kylie toned down
the prices a little bit and please give
us the Realty on the animal hair and all
the information because I think a lot of
us out there want to know what the
Realty is so you guys I cannot recommend
these brushes for you I think they're so
overpriced and at the end of the day
there are so many other affordable
options so I'm sure her dedicated fan
base is gonna swoop them up and at the
end of the day she's probably sitting at
home laughing at all of us because
everyone in my entire world is talking
about her brand once again so she's good
at marketing girl and gotta give you
that all right you guys thank you so
much for watching today's video I hope
you've learned something new sound off
below let me know what you really think
and I hope you enjoyed it thanks for
watching and I'll see ya on the next one
