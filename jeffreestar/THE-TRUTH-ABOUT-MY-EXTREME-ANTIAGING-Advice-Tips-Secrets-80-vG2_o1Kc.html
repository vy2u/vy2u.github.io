channel today I am NOT applying makeup I
know about my son a little shocking but
we're going to dive into the infamous
topic of anti-aging and skincare now
this is not a full regimen of how I do
my skincare I know you guys have been
asking for that for a long time I
promise I will do it this summer I want
to talk about anti-aging extreme
anti-aging and what I do personally to
look this way and it's crazy because to
me and a lot of people say doesn't
haven't seen me in a while or a few
years or like bitch are you like
rewinding the age clock how do you look
like that how do you have no wrinkles
under your eyes no bags it's not easy I
will say that I will say that right now
of course we're going to go into a
little in depth whole thing I'm also
going to be applying some masks I'm
going to be talking about my favorite
moisturizers favorite lip scrub Queens
eat for the hands neck face everything
bitch I got a cream for everything quick
disclaimer everything in today's video
works for me of course trying out things
throughout the years is how I discovered
a lot of this stuff and I'm also going
to be talking about some tips and tricks
that I do on the daily that of course
are free just everyday life from when
you're in the car when you're out in the
Sun all the crazy shit that I do to look
like this I just want to put it out
there you guys that I just turned 30
years old what's up 3-0 how are you so
what is thirty mean it means that it's
time to really amp up the anti-aging if
you don't want to age now there are a
lot of people who are going to say but
aging gracefully is amazing and I like
wrinkles sorry that was hard to come out
of my mouth now I do want to say one
thing because I always make jokes about
plastic surgery and fillers now I think
that a lot of YouTube beauty gurus the
way overboard with their fillers and
that's obviously their insecurities and
they have a lot going on right here but
if you want to do something for yourself
because you want to change you and there
is no other factors there's no one else
telling you what to do and you want to
do it for yourself I think that is the
only
time that you should do anything and
modify yourself if you want to get your
breasts done if you want to get bigger
lips if you want to get Botox and you
want to do it for you bitch go do it and
if it makes you feel better inside or
just because you want to change
something for fun I think that is what's
most important now I am going to say
this of course you guys have seen me get
lip injections on my channel but I do
not have Botox and a lot of people
probably make jokes because I've made
jokes and I'm very sarcastic guru but if
you I give a very sarcastic person and
throughout the years I have made jokes
about getting facial surgery crazy shit
done to me and a lot of it was just me
being funny and none of it was true so
I've had my lips done
do I have Botox do I have Spiller do I
have anything else in my face no that is
the final answer I don't know maybe
people don't believe me because I've
said shit in the past I don't know but I
can move my forehead I can move any part
of my face I mean there's no Botox in
this space or I'd be a little more
frozen I think the problem with today's
society and anti-aging and the market
for is a lot of times it's geared for
like old women or older people the
problem without you guys is that as kind
of I'm not saying it's too late but if
we're going to show a 60 year old a eye
cream it's already too late they are
they've aged already around their eyes
you have closely already and it's really
severe you know it's not that it's too
too late but you should have done it
before so I think a lot of the times all
these myths and secrets and tricks a lot
of it is really just like a lie and you
know companies are trying to sell you
the dream at the end of the day it's all
about genetics and also your diet is
very important I drink water all day
long it may seem like I'm just drinking
Red Bull on snapchat all the time but I
am drinking water all day long and your
diet is very important to aging as well
for all the people that are addicted to
caffeine and soda that just dries out
your skin and over time you will look a
little bit older as we like to say but
if you want to see what the fuck I'm
talking about and all these crazy tricks
I got on my sleeves and keep on watching
I at age I'm trying to thinking here
girl trying to rewind the fucking clock
one two three okay probably around age
15 so 15 years ago I trained myself to
not move my face so what does that mean
it means that you see my forehead I mean
for my age my forehead is very smooth
there are a little few fine lines in
there which is obviously normal but I
have done a really good job of when I'm
talking or laughing or really expressing
I don't really move my face and I don't
mean what I'm talking about
I move my face but I don't really move
this area a lot and I don't like move my
forehead so I don't really move my face
when I laugh I don't move my eyes now
we're about to dive into some skincare
and I'm going to show you guys some of
my favorite products we're going to test
out and show you guys a new mask that
just hit the market a month ago now when
I'm watching my face or cleansing you
need to find products that have no
alcohol in them okay
alcohol and anything is the devil it
will age you now some things have to
have a tiny bit amount of alcohol for
formulas and I understand that and I
definitely look past that sometimes but
toners ads of your alcohol in it you are
just literally wiping the future off of
your face so one of my favorite primers
ever is by the brand Sicily it is the
floral toning lotion now I have
mentioned this in a previous favorite
video this is my third bottle it is
amazing now I love to use little cotton
circles you can get these at the
drugstore now everything in today's
video guys sadly is really not drugstore
or price friendly anti-aging stuff you
really cannot find something that's
going to really stop time at Walgreens
but you can definitely do cotton pad and
I'm not trying to be shady but that's
just really really realistic I have
tried out so many products and I just
don't think that the drugstore is the
anti-aging kingdom of where you're going
to find all their secrets
so this toner it's a little more pricey
but it is amazing it's also good for dry
and sensitive skin out there last motown
what kind of skin do you have do you
have dr you have normal if you have
combinations you have oily I really fall
in that middle category of just normal
in the morning you guys I love to wake
up and before I even brush my teeth I
mean the teeth are really important
bitch but the skin is what I really
focus on first so I will take a little
cotton pad and I will put some all in
here and then I just wipe down my skin
and this will remove all the dirt and
oil that your skin was dealing with
throughout the night I will wipe down my
entire face and I love wiping down my
neck and neck and this area is very
important now let me show you something
a little disgusting you say that that
was on my face this is all the dirt and
oil from last night so once the dirt is
off of your skin then we can move on and
before we move on I just want to say a
few more brands that I'm really loving
right now now lemare you guys know it is
a very expensive skincare brand they
have amazing makeup now but this is
another toner it's called the tonic it
is amazing for just kind of like a
refresher throughout the day and it
doesn't leave you shiny or weird which
some toners can kind of leave your skin
feeling I don't know every I mean every
product has something different and then
recently the brand of fresh who I
discovered this before like two years
ago and now I am such a fan just put out
the Rose deep hydration facial toner and
yes those are rose particles in the
bottle I'm kind of living for it it
looks so cool and I don't have it in
front of me but I used to use a dove
toner from the drugstore actually and it
is alcohol-free so remember you guys
when you are buying stuff at the
drugstore or at the mall or anywhere
look on the back of the bottle or the
box and look at the ingredients it might
be in the middle it might be front might
be at the bottom but if the word alcohol
is in there and it's a toner run for the
hills so after I told my skin I love to
moisturize now it's going to be a little
public weird to explain this because I
use different moisturizers throughout
the week so I don't stick to one every
day you know sometimes I'll feel a
little more dry sometimes I'm traveling
like a few of my favorites that I am
obsessed with is I have to say this
limera1n I know I've mentioned this in
favourites videos but this is the
moisturizing soft cream and
I just ran out of my huge bottle it
lasted me like 11 months which is pretty
damn good another price point is a
little extreme and a lot of you're going
to like girls spare me but I think after
using it for a few years I've seen a
difference and I love how it makes me
feel another one that I am obsessed with
is this Dior cap share hotel moisturizer
and I love bringing this on trip now
another really great one that I
recommend to people is from the brand
fresh again this is the ultimate ageless
complexion treatment it is a soft cream
meaning it is a moisturizer that it's a
little weird because when you open it
feels like almost air like like almost
like flubber it's like not it's just
weird so I will take this and just kind
of rub it in between my fingers and then
we're just going to massage all over the
skin and I love just going all over the
face like a mini little massage also we
know what's crazy is perfume right I'm
just going to the quick side note when
you are spraying perfume on yourself
that is literal pure alcohol with
fragrance it's really like alcohol makes
with alcohol and we don't talk about the
drinking guy and we're talking about
real alcohol the ingredient and imagine
every morning what are you doing you
were literally spraying alcohol on your
skin every single day so when I do
perfume I really only spray it on my
clothes or I will dab a little bit and
I'll barely rub it but it's like Oh
every time I do it I'm just like
cringing because for ancient honey 18 so
I'm bringing the extranet as always so
the brand Sicily a few months ago it
came out with something that is for the
neck only this is the neck cream it's
supposed to firm refine and remodel your
existence now this is supposed to show
improvement after a month now I've used
for a while I'm not going to say that my
neck looks better does it feel softer
and has the skin kind of improved I a
hundred percent will say it has mmm
smells so good so the net cream looks
something like this it smells so fresh
and I love Sicily I know you guys have
heard me use this so many times on my
channel one of their favorite products
of mine is their primer which a lot of
youtubers are using now
one though the net cream work so we're
just going to take them out on our nail
we're just going to dawn it all over our
neck and this just feels so fresh and
amazing alright now let's talk about
when you are going to go out into the
world or you're going to leave your
house and you're going to say hello to
the Sun which is aka the devil and what
are we going to do about that now I am
someone that is we keep saying the word
extreme that's me
now when I go outside you guys I don't
ever sit in the Sun longer than five
minutes when I'm walking to my car
I will hold something up I'm literally
this is not what I hold up normally but
I hold up things so the Sun never
touches my face when I am walking around
let's say a demeans acceptable or an
outdoor mall or I'm walking somewhere
far I always bring like an umbrella I
don't give a fuck how dumb I look or
what people say about me also sunscreen
is very important you guys now you don't
have to get a bougie ass sunscreen of
course the drugstore has some great ones
from Neutrogena but I love a sunscreen
with SPF 50 now here's the disclaimer
that I'm just going to say and put it
out there a lot of brands even in the
drugstore or the mall will give a
disclaimer of yes 150 SPF set it up that
is as false advertisement and those
products do not exist any any brand is
allowed to put whatever number they want
on here and lie I don't know why that's
allowed legally but if you steam stuff
that's like 110 is yeah it's not real it
can only go up to 50 besides that I
always put on sunscreen before my makeup
definitely in the summer especially out
here I always wear sunglasses now I know
I've mentioned in some previous videos
and people probably roll their eyes but
girl I just kind of say one thing
sunglasses are probably one of the
biggest keys of anti-aging for me
personally that I have noticed
throughout the years I always look over
at people they're squinting their eyes
or funk they're looking crazy the Sun is
beaming on their face and traffic and
they're just like I'm not going to
depend on my eyes to pull but you know
what I mean when someone's 20 and it's
like crow's feet to the gods and I'm
like though so every time I leave the
house I don't care if I have full makeup
on or not I'm you
as an extreme example but I love
sunglasses now these glasses are very
obnoxious and big which I love anything
big in my hand mouth or face I love
these because they are massive you know
you don't have to get designer
sunglasses there are a million
sunglasses out there in the world just
get some better UV protected and don't
get played by some false ass
advertisement now I know we talked about
diet earlier but I think it's very
important to note that I don't party and
what I mean by parting is you guys like
don't drink alcohol I don't get wasted
and a lot of you notice about me but if
you are new hi I have never tried
alcohol before I know that's going to
seem shocking to some people even people
go and dig up old videos on my channel
when I was touring and doing music and a
lot of them were like oh my god find a
picture of you with a shot glass and I'm
like girl that was full of fiji water
and it was for the shot of like you know
the cameras for that moment I pretended
to take a shot of my friend there's also
a footage of me with a drink when you go
to have already asked for a Red Bull or
a Shirley Temple which by the way is
spraying grenadine for everyone out
there that is like what the hell is that
so it's come down alcoholic
I will hold a drink and it looks like
all my friends but it's Red Bull so
please do not try to clock me not
drinking is something that I am proud of
and I think at this age there's really
no point to start my family comes from a
long line of addicts and I know there's
some of you out there who can relate to
that anyone that has a crazy cousin or a
brother or a sister or parents who are
alcoholics or you know addicts
definitely can relate to me on that one
where you know me personally I didn't
want to follow the footsteps of my
family and go down that path so I chose
to never drink at a really young age
I've stuck to it I don't see the point
in it now
you know do I love smoking weed every
day yes that is relaxing and calming it
takes away my anxiety and I just feel
overall great after a hit or two also
quick note I had never tried cigarettes
I have never puffed on one of course I
have done one for pictures in the past
but I've never smoked and I think
cigarettes and nicotine are so awful I
don't know a lot of you're going to try
to come for me for smoking weed it is
such a big difference just go on google
and type what is the difference between
cigarettes and cannabis and you will get
a long list of what the hell's going on
so besides that you guys I loved face
masks and of course you guys to see me
use the gravity mud from glam glow over
and over it is one of my favorite
products of all time and another thing
that I love for moisturizing I know you
guys have seen me on all over my
snapchat using the Cicely Black Rose
cream mask also they have something
called the eye contour mask
yes this is crazy you can almost feel
like pulsing on your skin also I just
want to quickly shout out Kiehl's for
their midnight recovery eye treatment I
love this so I think I want to end this
video by using a new mask I just covered
a month ago and I've been trying it out
for a few weeks to make sure it works
before I even dare talk about it because
I am about to tell you all about no
bullshit so if you brand charlotte
tilbury which makes one of my favorite
news lipsticks of all time so this is
called the instant magic facial dry
cheek mask and basically this is
supposed to hydrate lips reduced
wrinkles soothe and brighten your skin
tones it comes like this you open it up
BAM so we'll take one out has their
classic rose gold packaging which I live
for now it's a little weird you guys
because it is literally like dry and
there she is
whoa so I'm just going to read you guys
the instructions now unfold your dry
sheet mask place pink side on to cleanse
skin
we're cleanse honey and it wants me to
loop the top hooks over my ears oh my
god another ear one fuck where's Manny
when I need them loop bottom hooks also
over the ears ensuring the mask is
smooth over every facial contour gently
massage on top to activate leave on for
15 minutes so the cool thing about you
guys is once it's on you rub it and
actually start to do something which is
crazy so I'm just gonna put this on me
right now look at that nose honey yes
now I'm a fool while you're breaking
alright so the math is on the face looks
a little weirder because it does fold
but it does seamlessly go the nose is on
so it basically says that it wants me to
gently massage now I've been this is my
fourth mask I've done and I really just
go exist back and forth and I just
massage it and this is basically
activating whatever ingredients are in
here and it is starting to soak into the
skin I know you can't see much and it
looks a little funky but I promise it's
working so I'm going to massages for
another 30 seconds and I'll be back in
15 minutes and 15 minutes later we're
back I'm going to take this mask off
mask on fuck you man all right mask off
Molly purposed okay all right and oh my
hair is call ready
all right now that the mask is off the
skin oh my god I don't know what is in
here when you rub it it is so crazy I'm
like where's the ingredients shea butter
glycerin crude oil seed butter vegetable
oil soybean oil oh my god okay well my
skin every time I use these I'm like you
know actually do a mask and you can't
stop filling your skin because it's
those baby soft that's what's happening
right now but besides that you guys I
hope you learned something new in
today's video if you think I am
ridiculous for wanting to never age
great keep on scrolling but I hope you
guys learned something and just be
careful out there with the Sun and your
diet and just remember at the end of the
day I love this type of stuff and this
is what I'm into I have been a makeup
artist for 15 years now
and I am all interesting care and I
think that it's very important if you're
someone that doesn't give a fuck and you
just watch this for entertainment thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you guys on the next video mmm ahh bye
