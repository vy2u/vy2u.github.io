channel now today we are doing nothing
makeup related I kind of just wanted to
turn the camera on sit here for a little
bit and just talk to you guys I know I
mentioned on snapchat a week or two ago
just kind of about like letting walls
down and letting you guys know a little
bit more about me personally I know for
the last year and a half as I have
entered the youtube realm I have really
just stuck to makeup makeup makeup and I
know I did a video like six months ago
that was called the tattoo diaries part
one where I kind of let you guys in on
my life and so many of you love that
video sorry that I haven't done a follow
up to it yet it is definitely coming but
um there's been a lot of like crazy
rumors and drama and just a bunch of
negative shit all over the internet
about I mean it's always about me but a
lot of it recently is just about me and
Nathan and I just kind of wanted to sit
down here and talk about my relationship
everything about it and just address a
lot of rumors that I've been seeing but
before we even dive into that let's talk
about the elephant in the room I know I
don't mean this fucking beautiful
highlight I'm talking about my hair this
is actually not a wig so for everyone
that does not follow me on snapchat my
hair colorist David he shot a few day
because you transformed me baby we were
actually going to do like a hot coral or
like a peachy type of coral vibe I was
like I want like peach hair I want peach
so we started to list out the hot pink
and it came out like so easy I have
really good genetics in my family when
it comes to hair well not hairline
insert joke there but we always have
really strong hair and our family's like
you can diet bleach it flat iron and do
whatever and it still so healthy so I
said you know what David let's take it
there so we were doing the hair and all
of a sudden all the pink was gone and I
was like oh my god you guys I haven't
had blonde hair in literally nine years
I used to bleed to my own hair in high
school I used to have like white
platinum blonde and I've had pink and
green and so many other colors
throughout the years definitely feels a
little weird to me right now like when I
looked in the mirror the other day I was
like oh my god the next morning I was
like holy shit who is this it's crazy
you know this feels like a part of me is
like missing
sounds weird but it's definitely
something that I'm going to probably
keep for a few months and then I'll do
my peach idea but for now I'm having a
little blond Ambition moments do blondes
have more fun I guess we'll find out so
I'm not really sure how to start this
video but I guess I'm going to just
address a lot of things that I've been
seeing and hearing and just like have
been witnessing all over the internet
now it's really crazy because when you
are dating someone or in love with
someone you really don't hear all of the
I guess negative stuff but when you live
your life online like I do and you are
all over YouTube and the internet and
Instagram snapchat and Facebook
obviously my life is in front of an
audience and I know that but it's crazy
when complete strangers try to pick
apart my relationship or make things up
and try to convince people that this is
real or like I've literally seen videos
of me and Nathan where someone has
literally just made up something out of
their ass and it literally never
happened wasn't even true and there's
like a thousand comments on this video
of people like debating it and talking
about it and agreeing with it or
disagreeing and it's just like blows my
mind that my relationship is even like
that exciting for people but then I have
to realize you know me and Nathan have
been building a story on YouTube and we
have been together for about two years
now and a few months and so much has
happened when I introduced him on my
channel I have no idea where the future
would take us and here we are you know
we have a house in Calabasas together we
have four dogs we have this amazing life
but a lot of you only see us you know
reviewing face masks or you know on
trips together and you really don't know
what is like under the surface or what
is behind the pink curtain as I'm going
to call it at the end of the day do I
really care what people say about me no
but then there comes to a point where
actually maybe I kind of do on some
subjects because when people try to tell
me your boyfriend only with you for the
money or your boyfriend has a weird vibe
or your boyfriend just wants you know
your bank account it's so crazy because
I'm like where did you even get that
from so let me rewind to early 2014 when
I started talking to Nathan and
met him for the very first time at the
time I was single for like seven years
and we'll talk about that later but when
I met him I had really just started my
company I was not wealthy I was not a
millionaire I did not have a crazy brand
I did not have a YouTube channel I
didn't have any of these things so it
just kind of makes me sad when people
try to throw that card in and I think a
lot of people hate to see others happy
we are in a very weird time in the world
where other people's success or
happiness makes other people upset
jealous angry and I can't really
understand that whenever I saw other
people more successful than me or had
nicer things in me or we're doing
something I wanted to do or I never
looked at it as like oh my god fuck them
like fuck this shit I can't believe
they're doing it I'm not it made me want
to work harder and made me motivated but
I know a lot of people aren't like that
so Nathan met me before I had money
plain and simple so please let's move on
from that subject and I don't know what
people think like you think he just logs
into my bank account every day or has a
debit card and it's go shopping all day
you know it's really funny and I'm just
going to keep it so real as usual when I
met Nathan he had no idea you guys what
any designer label was he is a
small-town guy from Michigan and people
don't really give a fuck about Louboutin
and Chanel out there they're literally
trying to like pay the rent and you know
work and try to find a job and just you
know everyone's pretty normal out there
and they are not wrapped up into social
media or any of this bullshit so it
trips me out how people try to I guess
say things that are literally a lie and
it's crazy when people make story time
videos about me and Nathan and they'll
and they have you know Adsense which if
you don't know what that is it's
basically ads on their video which makes
them money so while they're degrading me
and my man they're making money off of
it so it's like you're making money off
of people's you know sadness or anger or
pain or lies and it's just kind of crazy
like we live in a whole nother world to
get back on track before I met Nate I
was single for a long time and the
reason why is because I am relief not
attracted to anyone but what we call in
this world as a straight male or a nor
mole dude and what I mean by that is
like you know I am really into straight
guys and I know that it's going to not
be surprising to a lot of you if you
have been someone that has followed me
for a long time you know I come from the
music world if you are unfamiliar with
my music career I did music for eight to
nine long years I traveled the world I
met you know a million people I had I
grew an amazing fan base and this is way
before ever how to make a blind or did
YouTube from just traveling the world I
would always fall in lust I'm gonna sit
less because to me I have never been in
love until now and I really I guess that
really hit me and I really realized that
when I met Nathan I had never felt like
this with someone before I'd never had
that strong of a connection so you know
from just traveling everywhere and
meeting dudes all the time and being
around that world for so long I really
kind of fell into a trap of always being
someone that was kept like the secret
and when you are someone like me who is
you know I get asked all the time even
every day on my channel you guys I get
comments are you a guy are you a girl
are you trying to gender are you trying
to transition what are you and I don't
even know how to answer that
like obviously I was born a male I just
feel like I'm Jeffrey being someone that
is like me that is a guy that looks like
a woman right I keep doing this because
so many people are not into labels these
days and I love that I'm all about that
you do you call yourself whatever you
want whatever you believe in I think
that is the beauty and the freedom of
you know living is we can be whoever we
want to be I have always been into
straight men and the problem with that
my entire life is I never found real
love because straight men behind closed
doors they love people like me they love
hooking up they love having fun they
love the relationship as long as other
people don't know as long as her family
doesn't know as long as their friends
don't know so imagine you guys always
being the secret and never fully being
accepted and never fully loved I was
tired of that I was really really tired
of it so I went on a long hiatus from
dating people hooked up with people had
fun has little you know flings in little
relationships I think if you date
someone for two months that is not your
boyfriend you literally were hanging out
with
for a few months it didn't work out so I
don't like to call people my boyfriend
if I dated you for a few months I think
that's silly
until I met Nate I'd never had I guess
real real love and I get asked all the
time how can someone that is a straight
male beaten to you men are into me and I
know it's kind of shocking to some
people a lot of you were like girl we
know the t we already know it you know
rappers and actors and all these people
behind closed doors are hooking up with
guys that look like chicks and and
transgender people and it's a very
common thing maybe not where you are
from but in California it is a very big
and I've traveled the world you guys
I've had a million guys married single
divorce all have hit on me and you know
if that's just sexuality you know we can
have a sexuality video some other time I
would definitely have to do one so when
I met Nathan he had only ever been with
chicks and if you guys go back on my
channel and watch a lot of our Q&amp;amp;A is
you will find a lot of Nathan's history
and he even explains it a little that
you know he's always been attracted to
guys that look like women but in
Michigan there is no Jeffrey stars there
are no Nikita dragons there are no Gigi
gorgeous there there there are none of
us beautiful you know creatures and
those beautiful women in Michigan so I
think when they found me he was like oh
my god this is like I don't know I don't
know what he thought really I'm I guess
we can ask him one day but he was
attracted to me obviously he hit me up
and I was really attracted to him
something about him drew me in and I was
like okay like let me give this guy a
chance I had no idea what to expect you
guys he flew to LA for two days
literally a weekend he's like I'm gonna
come hang out let's just chill whatever
I thought really we're going to be
really real I thought we were just gonna
hook up say goodbye have a good weekend
together and then that was that and I'll
never forget when he pulled up to my
house and I locked eyes with him I was
like whoa I don't know what it was I
don't even how to explain the feeling of
like a real bond like this connection
that just like hit me and I was almost
like breathless two and a half years
later I can say that I think I have
finally not think I know truly deep down
that I have real love and I don't even
know how to explain it love is such a
weird thing I know a lot of you out
there have children you're married
you're divorced you're single there are
so many walks of life out there watching
this and I just want to let you know
that
took me 29 years to find someone decent
enough that respected me that you know I
wanted to give my time to and you know
Nate has had to deal with a lot he's had
to deal with me you know growing as a
brand as a person as a you know
influencer as a celebrity whatever you
want to call me I think all those words
are silly but we do love to label things
and it's also important I get it but
whatever you want to call me is that
Nate has grown with me kids you know
been with me since day one when I even
wanted to start a channel we have filmed
videos together that have had millions
and millions of views and I think a lot
of you were enamored by the fact that
Nate loves women but he also is now
dating me and I think a lot of you are
tripped out by that and it's crazy how
many girls and women out there are still
direct messaging me on Instagram and
it's bizarre to me like there's girls
you guys that literally write let me
know when you're done with that faggot
come back to the pussy and I'm like girl
I just think it's sad that people want
to try to ruin a relationship or try to
break it up but the thing about Nate is
that there is so much trust like I wish
you guys could see him day to day and
see what a beautiful strong amazing nice
genuine like person that he is because
you know I know that you guys see a
fraction of what it is on YouTube and
online but um you know we have full
transparency you know I don't know how
other couples rate are but like we
really don't ever argue like there's
really not much to ever argue about
everything is always happy and amazing
and I've never felt like this before
it's crazy to think that other people
out there want to hurt a relationship or
people want him to you know try to write
back so you can screenshot it and make a
news story and it's just like oh my god
I couldn't imagine being that unhappy
with myself where I would want to hurt
others I guess I can't relate to that so
for all you people out there that like
to threaded diem other people of men you
need help you really do and when you
grow up later in life you will realize
how dark and sad that aspect really is I
could never imagine doing that to
someone so I think to kind of go back to
what I'm really trying to say here is I
want to let you guys know that
I am in love and I think that it's so
funny to say on a video because I've
never felt these feelings before but you
know here we are two years plus later
and I finally still accept it I can't
believe that someone accepts me for all
my flaws you all know I'm not perfect
you know we all have our personality
what we're going to call them defects or
you know we have our issues and we've
had our pasts any we all come from
something and we all come from a you
know whether it's a good or dark past
and you know when you meet someone they
have to figure that out we have to
realize like oh my god can I really
accept this person for everything that
they are and also you guys being in the
spotlight or being in front of an
audience all the time can be difficult
for a relationship and there's always so
many factors from all angles coming in
whether it's negative or positive and
Nathan just loves me completely for me
he's accepted all of my flaws and you
know I'm not one to always get emotional
but it's crazy to sit here and think
about that like you know it took me 29
years to finally feel accepted by a man
that really is compassionate and has
real love and I get asked all the time
you know how to make parents still about
you how to lose family feel about you
and you know it's crazy that they are
all so open-minded amazing individuals
they don't look at me as anything but
just Jeffery you know a normal person
who is you know dating their son and
they love me it's so fun to go to
Michigan you know me and Nate just
bought a house and Grand Rapids and
shout out to all my Michigan people in
the man I'll be there very soon on and
off all throughout the year and it's
cool to just you know go to Michigan and
you know go to the gun range and you
know go to restaurants and go camping
and hiking and all these fun things and
just be a normal person
at the end of the day once the makeup is
all off and I'm just sitting there they
accept me for me I don't know you guys I
guess I just wanted to share that and I
don't know if you know I don't really do
story time videos on my channel so if
this is a little jumbled I'm sorry but I
just want to say thank you to everyone
out there that watches my channels that
watch
my reviews in my makeup tutorial and
that trust me for my opinion you know
that's what I'm here for and I love you
guys so much thank you for watching this
video and of course if you guys want
more story time videos please let me
know in the comment section down below
and I just also want to say a side note
I know a lot of you have been seeing
snapchats with like jewelry
no me and Nathan are not engaged I have
been wearing rings for a while now he
has a ring on his right hand and I think
every time he likes tap shots it like
flips it so you guys are likely died his
left hand he engaged I don't know if I
ever want to get married maybe I'll get
married in a year maybe I'll never get
married I don't know yet but I do know
that we are happy how we are right now
and we don't need a ceremony or a piece
of paper to change any of that besides
that no kids no marriage a lot more dogs
and a lot more adventures we do love
traveling the world and I really
appreciate all of you guys that watch
our vlogs and everything we do on the
road it's just so fun to be able to
travel with your best friend and you
know wake up every morning to someone
that can look at you with no makeup and
a bare face and just say I love you um I
think that is one of the most rewarding
feelings of the human being is to
actually experience that so alright guys
that is it for today and I don't know I
told myself we're not going to cry on
YouTube where I can require on this
channel so I am going to let you guys go
for now and I will see you on the next
one mwah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
