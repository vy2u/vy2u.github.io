get you ready I can't believe it's with
me and lipstick Nick are going to do our
first ever get ready where we do our own
makeup sit chat I want you guys to get
to know Nicole more we're gonna talk
about some stories when we first met Oh
God we're gonna go down memory lane so
many good men somebody um we've done so
many shoots together Nicole has been
with me since day one even before I had
a brand she did the makeup for the first
ever jst photo shoot we have a lot of
history we do have a long history yeah
okay so besides that a lot of you may
have heard that we are teaching some
makeup classes together and we actually
we didn't make up to our long time day
most people don't know this they don't
2014 for YouTube before the brand was
like the brand yeah we did like I won
see seven or eight together and then you
went off and did some solo ones
defending the tour but I love teaching
and I actually just finished up a solo
beauty tour come back and do a little
reunion tour I don't know like some big
cities and go together we just vibe so
off each other Jeffrey's obviously a
favorite face to pay ever so they're
really fun and we have a class coming up
in Grand Rapids Michigan
well a lot of people might read us like
okay you said big cities and we're
saying Grand Rapids we're gonna do a lot
of cities but I really want to do one in
Michigan first I am a Michigander now
and I'm obsessed I go there all the time
and we'll be actually I'll be there two
weeks for our class yeah yeah so I think
you know what we have to do in there so
pastor June 23rd we will be there and
then we're on to Houston in July so you
guys want any ticket information
everything will be linked down below
then we're gonna talk about the classes
in a minute so the cool thing about
today is Nicole what are we doing so
today we're gonna do a get ready with
you but we're gonna use some products
that are in our goodie bags for our
classes actually so I'm excited a lot of
it is stuff we already know and love and
some stuff is new so yeah
we're gonna dive in there's three
different types of tickets ultra VIP VIP
and general admission and ultra n VIP
for Houston and Michigan are like wow
I'm like oh my god Nicole so ya see we
added even more tickets sold out I like
people are like oh there's only ga-ga
left but GA tickets are still bomb like
you guys are gonna get to watch the
whole Yas still ask us questions like
there's a whole thing so um don't don't
be discouraged you still get a goodie
bag like there's still a lot of stuff
that you guys are gonna get as GA so
it's not like a bad ticket it just a lot
of people wanted you know to like meet
us and hang out with us and stuff which
you know obviously is gonna be cool but
and you know they are and they're still
available for both dates but all the
other tickets are sold out no pressure
now most of you understand ticket prices
you respect us you know our worth but
there's a good side of the internet that
was like trying to strip suck our ticket
prices there's so much involved it's a
huge like 4 to 5 our demonstration class
you get to talk to us and ask any
question personal or makeup wise and you
get a goodie bag thousands of dollars of
free makeup so it's definitely a whole
experience not just like a little moment
in a class where they're literally
sharing all their I'm not hiding
anything like we literally talk about
all of our favorite drinks like
like what I do on set and what Jeff
resented his life and my life so it's
like it's very personal it's a lot of
knowledge you're getting and yes it's
treat it like a school so if you think
about it like that which it really is um
you know then I think that the press is
completely justified or we wouldn't have
put them on for that no tea no shade
they sold out which is OK I'm ready to
freakin turning pink over here what I'm
sweating right guys if you want to see
us get ready and get to know Nicole more
we keep on watching now in the goodie
bags I said okay Nicole we're gonna do a
primer my favorite primer right now this
year is the Tasha the silk canvas it's
so good so but then Nicole goes I get
well not everyone has the same type of
skin so we're also including the amazing
benefit
cosmetics Porefessional we've been using
this for years this is always in my kit
I always always always love that you get
a whole beautiful box it comes pre like
wrap look it has a little coin product
what the whole experience with this coin
I remember I use this on you the first
time for the promo photo for our class
yes indeed we got to recreate that look
was should we use the scooper yeah I
need a little moisture on my face it's
the same okay oh this is gonna be in the
goodie bag okay let's do so this is from
the creme shop I'm sure I am obsessed
with their products so bomb in stuff I
found out about them through Nicole now
they were the official sponsor for a
Nicole's entire tour and I said Nicole I
really love their products I think
they're kind of like a brand now some
people haven't heard of yeah I wanted to
hear about they really they're so
affordable yeah really really good I
love all their stuff so the creme shop
is now the official sponsor or they are
behind the brush tour yes ma'am
through chrome shop it has hyaluronic
acid in it which is bomb for skin if you
guys don't know much about skincare you
want to get something with hyaluronic
acid in it because it actually locks in
moisture from your skin lot so in feels
good okay so you don't need a lot of
this right that's okay I'm gonna get
that little mom and I love it and I love
this because it you just push it in your
pores and it's like you know so many
primers like it's blaring blah blah blah
you don't think yeah doesn't really work
mmm-hmm I think this one works no I
honestly if you know mayor if you've
ever talked to me like on some real
you know that I could don't believe it
guys meet James have talked about this
but like honestly when I use this I feel
it actually smoothing like my pores so
I'm kind of in it you know like I just
pack on so much powder on people I know
it's gonna stay on no matter what
exactly yes but it is nice to have some
blurring effect so yeah actually a
working oh yeah okay so I you know we're
we travel so way too much yeah so talk
show also is including in the ultra VIP
goodie bags the silk can
this mini for travel cue got opened up
you're gonna oh my god get ready for it
it's the cutest thing I've ever seen
besides looks like a little contact lens
case or something oh my god it's so cute
so if you don't want to travel with a
bunch of heavy stuff you do your mini
what are we gonna use okay I have so
many memories with this brush this leave
spot okay so a long time ago years ago
Nicole first introduced me to morphe
brushes okay insane to think that just
three to four years later we would be
like opening retail stores together my
brand would be in all their locations
I'm like thanks for me to them early she
really believed in their brand and their
products and this was one of my first
ever brushes where I fell in love with
them and I was like hooked yeah roll
yeah this is like they're like Holy
Grail brush that like totally put them
on the mouth foundation then 4:39
everybody has at least one the lion is
the foundation amazing and this is
before Beauty blenders and sponges were
a big thing but me Nicole left cheese
both we do brushes sponges everything
we're very hands-on so what are you
gonna use today I'm gonna use the hood
of Beauty foundation super full coverage
full bitch I'm gonna use the Lottery's
skin caviar bougie ass these I
remember that yeah okay we're just gonna
blend and twirl hands her you've been
working so much oh I have been it's a
good it's a good problem and it's so
cool because you've worked so hard for
such a long time at a young age it's
like unreal can you please let ever know
how old you are now I'm 26 I'm gonna be
27 next week well you are and guess what
the same day June 16th and Nicole's
Beatty is is the 30 long what a fun
birthday present I know hi tell us more
baby okay so there was the team yet okay
so I'm 26 now I start doing makeup when
I was 17 at my high school in Corona
California Corona
yeah from ie if anybody knows where that
is
uh-huh and I'm just doing it for like
proms and different dances and stuff
everybody kept asking me and then I
wasn't charging them that my dad was
finally like dude you need to charge
people because our freaking living room
was like filled up with people Oh little
menu and stuff is like really cute oh my
god and they start charging and then I
was like this is cool but up until then
I was like maybe I'll be a tattoo artist
like I don't know what I was gonna be
excited to draw stuff then I really
loved makeup and everyone was like tell
me I was so good at it so I was pursue
it yeah I was like okay this is easy and
I like it you know it's easy to me it
just came naturally and it was fun so I
went to makeup school right after went
to Mudd makeup designer hearing and
that's in Burbank California right Bank
yes and I started working in film and
television and doing like a lot of music
video stuff like that that was just
hustling man like hours is like full-on
hustling I was on with that site model
mayhem Oh like Facebook but for like
artistic yes models hair people makeup
artists so I was just on there like
posting like new makeup artist wants to
do a candy-themed shoot like all kinds
of stuff and just meeting people it's
still thing why don't my hem is still a
thing is it really yeah but now it's
like you people have Instagram see we
just DM someone be like okay like how
can I do your makeup for a shoot or like
whatever and then then I started working
on it I did a feature film when I was
like 19 my first feature film it's on
Netflix anyway yes I do a feature film
but I was like this is cool but like
film was just so like boring to me like
kinda just because you're on set all day
but you're not really doing anything
like artistic okay you know it's not for
everyone
what's not right it wasn't for me but I
much I like like commercials and music
videos like that more and I started from
math courses where we met yes okay
before we get into that story yep mama
needs some concealer how do you
concealer - what are you gonna use - I'm
gonna use shape tape because that's what
is it my last night okay the bomb I'm
gonna go in with my new favorite makeup
revolution concealing to find the
actually just put out a new shades I was
begging for one to be a little lighter
it's here oh my god Wow see 0.5 why not
get a little tan this summer like last
summer first of all last year me Nicole
went to Bora Bora
oh hell yeah that vlog is on my channel
that was so much fun that was insane
my favorite place ever that was my like
third time going I'm moving there one
day look they can't wait to move with
you huh
exactly okay the time of our lives and I
love I just love being a little more tan
like I've been pale for ever yeah I
could always tell when you get tagged
stuff to go darker in their foundation
yeah alright so we're gonna use the edgy
blending sponge from the creme shop I
just love the color cheery it said I was
gonna do it right now we're gonna buff
and blend this concealer out ooh
we are highlighted to fill honey okay so
a little more human right yeah okay
under eye setting powder you're using
bananas good night oh yeah right okay Oh
Nicole's use this on me countless times
it's almost empty that's chanel natural
finish so baby nothing natural about it
really there we go her lungs that
probably have so much makeup in it it's
coated uh-huh
so are my tits oh I can't wait for when
they do my autopsy like way later in
life things are gonna find ya a lot of
product the whole body just coated in
setting powder and um what are we gonna
do next I'm gonna set my face okay I'm
gonna pull out this old-school Mac brush
that they used to make when you used to
work there and the same with me I
remember ex Mac employee here all right
we're gonna contour contouring i'm using
the hoola okay
I'm gonna use this you're probably like
what the hell safe word I love that
so the androgyny palette has this color
and actually you guys pointed it out
there would be an amazing contour shade
like a year ago
tried it obsessed with it yeah it's
better blend you guys know what failing
is yeah please explain okay so we're not
kidding yes so I always veil with my
powders so like for example I just did
my my hoola if it comes on like a little
too strong I'll go back in with my brush
for my all-over powder and just veil it
like do a light little veils powder over
it so it kinda like dims it down and
like helps to blend
yes blending yeah with blush I do that
was wrong
just a nice little trick if so you have
a heavy hand you're someone that like
fur over doesn't with the powder uh-huh
which yes which is yeah totally when
you're moving quickly you're just kind
of like I gotta get this on
everywhere I get asked us a lot like
when did you in Nicole first me yes such
a good story okay yeah so wait I would
tell it way back in the day when I was
working at Mac I remember I was were
gonna Mac Hollywood in Thailand yeah one
of the most famous location famous
locations it's like so coveted it was
like you can't work there unless you've
been with the company for like 5000
years but I had just come in and I was
like plaid I got it was so excited so
I'm working obviously it was a huge fan
of you right now yeah a lot of people
don't know that no yeah totally a fan
like the biggest fan full myspace
mailman well MySpace moment would
literally listen to plastic surgery
slumber party yes you came in to shop
yeah I was there all the time my
apartment at the time was in North
Hollywood like six miles away and that
was the closest Mac yeah you're still in
there all the time
apparently but I had never seen him
before so I was in there with helping
customer and then Jeffrey walked in and
I was like shook like I did not know him
I would girl I was like like completely
froze okay but cool Mike work I'm like
okay don't don't fangirl and cool like
you don't fangirl that's so not me you
know Mellie I don't even take pictures
with people anyone right like no and
then my friend my coworker was like you
could just introduce you like he's in
here all the time and I was like no
actually like so like totally didn't
want that was like oh okay went in the
back freaked out a little bit and then
walked back out and then you were like
just like looking at me as I was like
checking someone out and then you were
like showing me this pink scooter that
was in the garage oh my God my shooter
at the time yeah you were like oh and I
was like oh my god that's so cool bag
could flew you were talking to me and
maybe you you were like oh my god like
what your makeup is so pretty like would
you ever want to do my makeup one day I
know how did you feel in that moment I
honestly was in shock I thought I got
out of body experience I was like didn't
know it was real I was like what I was
like yeah sure
and then I remember you gave me your
number we're texting and yeah can't
 believe don't text Jefferson
right now and then it turns out you
lived like right down the street from me
in North Hollywood yes
we went shopping literally the next day
so my side of the story which is
identical to yours but when I walked
into the MAC store I was someone that's
like unless someone had like the like a
sick make up I didn't know that it was
my kind of talk to you but you're
gravitated towards people that are that
fit your style so if you go into a
Sephora and there's 13 employees you
want to gravitate to someone that maybe
wears makeup like you do or has the same
kind of style so I looked in the koi I
was like Jerome bitch was and I was
really gravitated towards Nicole and
then the next day we hung out we did
nothing we got doughnuts
yo sweets addicts and then Nicole was
like I just moved into my apartment like
I don't know if you were like
embarrassed I was so embarrassed
I'm so poor not that I'm rich now but I
was like in a low place I just starving
artist like legitimately like living
with the roommate and like I had no
furniture this is like 2012 13 13 yeah
she doesn't 13 and you had no idea which
I'm gonna talk about this later on a
crazy know is that I was like trying to
start my brand I was about to quit music
and I was like in between like careers
and I was like bro just so nuts to think
about I had nothing hardly I got left
and it was just like I'm gonna invest my
last few coins on these few liquid lips
it's insane and I never I'll never
forget showing Nicole the first-ever lab
sample of what would be Redrum prom
night and I'm royalty all pink room in a
two-bedroom with a loft upstairs and no
ho there's Nicole to come over we were
just playing squash and you know what's
crazy I was embarrassed of you coming
over really yeah cuz I was like damn
like she's known about me for a minute I
was like this you know the biggest
person on myspace like I'm like your
apartment was so nice it was it was
really cute but I was like oh my god
Nicole's probably think I'm supposed to
live in a mansion and
you know how it yeah yeah I don't like
I'm embarrassed people know that's you
see how I was like so you didn't care
about my living centers no like oh
 ride care like to me at that
time I was like damn you got a
two-bedroom with the law she's killing
it whoo all right come on brows so I'm
gonna go for the alien look I've been
going for all year - what's shavers off
right now on camera okay oh no I have
very little eyebrow because I over
plucked when I was younger
okay tell everybody because this is a
good advice for people that want a
little ham right now yeah don't get to
him because I had huge eyebrows like
bushy imagine those they were big girls
are cool at the time you know I was like
in high school it was like very like no
doubt oh my god ladies honey yeah like
it was you know like tragic kingdom' the
no doubt album came out in sixth grade
for me is unsane oh my god I know you
were like you got it
but you over plucked a lot like my and
at the time it was cool but I didn't
know how I feel my eyebrows and I was
like whatever I'm just gonna be skinny
eyebrows forever
yeah but then hi now I regret it so then
what are you gonna use for your brows I
know we have some goodie bag products
from benefit as well yes so when you go
to our makeup class you get a lot of
moments you get the little gimme brow
which is one of my favorite products of
all time but I don't have enough hair
for it really so high it's really good
I'm gonna still use benefit but I'm
using the goof proof brow pencil okay I
just use this to make my base shape and
then I'm gonna fill it in with Anastacio
dip brow oh all right send a cold lay
down the gimme brow now she's going in
with the dip brow brow okay it depends a
little bit lighter so I just kind of
like to like ombre the front a little
bit
boy she's doing that I'm gonna do a
little highlight today so we have a new
highlighter formula coming out whip - we
have the liquid Frost and then we have
these supreme Frost's I think I'm gonna
post a promo picture in the next few
weeks so we're not showing this on
camera okay yeah I'm so shady actually
James told me this is his favorite thing
to do so I'm gonna do a little bit of it
we spray your whole face and fix+ of
course and then you take a brush and dip
into the powder oh I just have to take a
moment to watch you do this okay so this
is a new homicide flavor this is a new
flavor it is
very honestly so supreme frost is very
reflective and the beauty lights it does
look a little different in real life
it's very 3d and it just looks blinding
on the skin like coolest like I love
watching people do this I love watching
I'm looking a little under like it's
pouring oh I am packing on this supreme
frost like it ain't nothing like you
think I'm gonna turn on my own flash on
my phone so you guys can really see the
T over here ooh that sparkles good with
shifts like oh oh that will be end of
July early August all right you better
bake honey uh-huh putting a little
underneath to catch fallout cuz I'm
