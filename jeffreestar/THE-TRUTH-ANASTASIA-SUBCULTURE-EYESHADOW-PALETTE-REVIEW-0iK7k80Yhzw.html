channel I literally leave town for a few
days I've been at Michigan for like
three days over the weekend
and the Internet has gone fucking crazy
the beauty community is up in arms
everyone is gossiping talking and I'm
like girl this is this is all about I
shadow I need to see what the hell is
going on
so of course today we are talking about
the subculture eyeshadow palette from
Anastasia Beverly Hills now consistently
they have been a really great brand over
the last few years they have turned into
a small brand into a fucking empire with
an entire range of products I was dawn I
loved on yesterday the internet was
going nuts
people were just talking about all these
crazy reviews on YouTube and there's so
many mixed reviews on this some people
are like oh my god it's the best thing
ever some people think it's the worst
thing ever and I'm like over some damn
makeup so I'm like you know what let me
take a dip into this palette and I
really appreciate that so many of you
are tweeting me and hitting me up on
Instagram and snapchat and you're like
Geoffrey review this subculture palette
we want to know what the real T is so
today we are going to play with this and
create an eye look of course I already
have my foundation down let's get into
this damn review so if you want to see
me test out the subculture palette to
keep on watching this palette retails
for $42 to think about the modern
renaissance palette which is probably
their top selling palette to date it is
such a staple and a lot of people's you
know make a collection and what they use
day to day I did a review on this
palette like a year ago when it first
came out and it has just turned into a
really like a staple and a lot of
people's looks people love this damn
palette so I pulled a baby out and I
remembered the quality of it because so
many people were like okay Jeffrey we
want to know what you think is it the
same as this or the same consistency and
I'm like oh my god I haven't played with
this and so long so I dipped into it
today I went back and I watched my
review and I'm like okay I'm educated on
what the hell is going on let's try the
other palette you do get 13 brand new
shades in this palette one of them is
they repeat so there are 14 shades but
shade fudge is a
I think it's a single shadow in the
collection here is the color selection
I'm just going to pop it this brush out
now the brush did come with it so once I
landed today I'm like why is everyone
going so hard on this and being so extra
or are they being extra I don't know
we're about to find out so I did take
the brush that came with it and I kind
of went in on the color new wave this
kind of like orange color here and I'm
like okay what is going on people knew
yes I did notice there was some fallout
and we're going to do some zoom ins I'm
going to show you everything I obviously
haven't tested any other shade except
that when I kind of hit it with this
side and I'm like okay of course I do
want to prime my eyes like I always do
with every review I like to be
consistent so of course you guys I do
have a little bit of foundation on my
lids now I'm going to go in with the Mac
painterly paint-pot and I'm just going
to take a little synthetic flat brush
and just coat my lids with this just
like I do with every tutorial normally
before I review something I never watch
anyone elses reviews because I don't
want to ever be biased or like okay well
maybe they liked it how come I don't
ever like to watch anyone's reviews but
girl the internet was going crazy this
weekend so I literally sat and I watched
like 10 reviews and I'm like okay girl
some people had a really hard time some
people it worked amazing for and I'm
like girl what the fuck at the end of
the day it's just eyeshadow and people
are acting like it is literally World
War 3 I get it you know people spend
their hard-earned damn money on makeup
and they want to make sure that it works
so whenever there's like an
inconsistency or anything crazy the
internet goes nuts nowadays now some
people do like to be overly dramatic I
know you guys are all looking at me like
I mean you know it's all about personal
preference of what that really means I
think some people try too hard to get a
reaction from a brand or to get like
attention online we've definitely seen
that with the Jaqueline palette people
be lying and shit but this one I saw
some crazy shit online so I'm like you
know what I need to try this for myself
alright let's zoom into this palette I'm
going to show you how much fallout there
is if there's any and let's just do a
little zoom in
all right so I'm going to take the brush
that came with the palette and we're
just going to knock into Roxy so there
is a one two three and that is what
happened and here is what is on the
brush now I'm going to knock this off a
little bit and let's see if you can see
it oh girl let's just glue all over my
damn Gucci
are they powdery this shade is so far
let me go in with another clean brush
we'll just do this little blending brush
and let's hit shade NuWave now that is
how I would normally dip into a palette
so you see yes there is a lot of
kickback the brush is completely coated
now let's once again hit this off and
let's see what happens okay let me show
it one more time so we are going to dip
into there and you see there is a lot on
this brush the bristles are black and
let's just do it one more time you see
that they are powdery which you know a
lot of eyeshadow palettes are powdery is
it going to blend out that's really
what's most important to me so now that
we've gotten that out of the way tis a
powdery clearly it is does it blend
we're about to find out so let's take
the shade
NuWave right here that we already dipped
into I'm just going to take the same
brush this is a little Cosette blending
brush I'm just going to SPI lightly dip
into my pans and that's what you get so
let's see how this looks on the eye of
course because that is the real question
I need a little mirror here here we go
alright I'm taking shade and NuWave and
I am just going to place this or right
into my crease
I mean that's pigmented Looch okay now
I'm going to take a little witchy brush
I love to take this with no shadow and
just kind of go up and blend any like
lines to make them really seamless in
airbrush so let's do that right now
alright we're going to go in one more
time I'm going to go in with the brush I
was a very light handed girl
lord have mercy just going to tilt my
head back a little bit and let's just
pop that right in the crease all right
now we're going to go in with this
really cool mustard a yellow shade
called edge so I'm going to take this
and just dip into here and I'm being
very light and you can see she's powdery
okay cool let's see what happens all
right moving on we are going to take
shade all-star it is this maroon color
up top so let's go and I'm barely
touching the brush and it gets coated
like shake that off a little bit and
let's see what happens I'm going to go
in a little bit more
now I'm going to take that just kind of
move it up into my crease and I'm just
going to buff this out for some inner
Rama all right now obviously these lines
are a little harsh so I'm going to go in
with the blending brush that I used
earlier as no product on it except a
little residue from all-star and I am
just going to now soften that line now I
do want to go back in with this brush
and we're going to hit new wave one more
time so I'm going to go in you guys and
just kind of go over the darkness and
just try to soften that now I've seen so
many people asked like we want to know
how the hell these blend out I've seen a
lot of people that are having problems
blending them together there's like
streakiness or patchiness so I am going
to look closely and I will see this the
shadows like they're not skipping but I
feel like right here it's like really
really dark and then there's kind of
like almost like a little gap so I'm
just going to take some more shadow from
the brush tuck it in here okay it's kind
of weird to me only because like tell me
if I'm psychotic or not but like right
here it almost appears like let me tell
my head back darker and then it's a
little lighter right in there or am I
just losing my mind here see like look
some a room like maroon e red there and
then it like got darker I mean maybe
because of the orange shadow it's like
girl we do not want to play well
together not really sure so I started to
do this side of the eye and I'm kind of
having the same problem where I actually
love how the color looks down here but
mixed with the orange it just got kind
of really weird so I'm going to tilt my
head all the way back you can see I know
it's a little messy I am going to do a
little concealer and cut out some of the
color yeah I'm like not loving this like
to me it seems like this almost turned
like a blackish gray right here and then
where the color was by itself it's fine
which is so bizarre to me like let me
try to load
or on air I'm packing I'm packing yeah
that looks like the color and then as
soon as it mixed with the new wave and
edge it got darker I'm a girl I did not
put black and my mother's I'll be great
so I M tripped out a little bit right
now I really am dying to try like these
metallic colors right here so I'm going
to use a little bit of the tart shaped
Cape concealer and we are going to do a
little we're going to cut out some of
that product and give my eye a little
moment now the trick is to go in honey
and do not worry about it so I'm going
to take this and just put it right there
all right so I'm going to take the color
all-star one more time and I'm just
going to kind of put it right where the
concealer is and just kind of create a
little bit of a blending now what in the
mother fuck is going on look at my eye
why does it turn so like it almost looks
black like it does not look like the
color I was just using I literally have
used this the whole entire time we're
going to go in again okay you see it now
I'm going to go over here and let's just
see if that happens over here see it
like looks Burgundy Marone and then for
some reason it's like I don't understa
Saar I'm like trip out now I'm actually
feeling like I'm in the twilight zone
I'm like I'm like listen I'm like I'm
sober I'm not even high aren't you guys
we're just going to a keep it moving now
my eye is all right I'm try to fix it
add a little bit more I don't know why
I'm like is the color oxidizing is that
the brush is it the concealer I'm not
really sure I've never really had to top
in before but now that the concealer is
on there I am dying to try this crazy I
mean I'm wearing a whole especially hmm
so electric looks to be like it's
beautiful like almost like a shifty
green yellow so I want to put that over
where the concealer was now people
always are weird about when you doing
the review with the metallics I always
will wet the brush with six plus or any
setting spray go in the pan and then the
eye but of course we are doing a little
review today so let me go in with a dry
brush
just that we're all the same page this
brush has no moisture I am going to dip
in here so let's do that
okay so there's really no fallout with
that color yeah it's not really sticking
onto my brush let's see what it looks
like or right here the intensity for me
is not really there let me go in one
more time and do a second layer it's
really subtle like obviously you guys
can see okay where is my X plus now
which is a morphic spray it's literally
my favorite setting spray so we're just
going to wet the brush so we're going to
go in here now that's wet okay a lot
more pigment on the brush let's go to
the eye and let's put this bitch on it's
pretty not really like obsessed with it
I was hoping for like a like holy s
metallic moment I'm going to go back in
with this brush real quick and it's kind
of blending these two together now I
used this all-star color for all over
the lid obviously you guys have been
watching this I have not dipped into the
dark shade or a V yet and for some
reason it's like dark right here and
then it goes back to being the color and
when I put it in the crease it turned a
really dark almost like a plum gray
black color which I didn't do on my eye
so I'm like I'm really tripping out
right now alright so I'm going to take a
little Tom Ford pencil brush and I'm
going to dip it shade let's do untamed
it is like a green color and I'm just
going to dip into there okay you see it
coated the brush completely let's see
how this looks
now I'm being really gentle with how I
blend this out I'm being really like I'm
like kind of barely touching the skin
and I'm going to just a layer moving on
I am going to take a little bit more bun
tame we're just going to go today Q now
a lot of times I love to take a brush
we'll just use the one that came with
the palette and I like to go in with a
lighter shade like NuWave so I like to
take the shade or something like this
and just kind of barely touch under it
just so it kind of gives it some kind of
artsy weird depth to it and we're going
to go into and tame barely like I'm just
kind of barely in the pan and then we're
going to just blend these together all
right you guys the bottom is done and
girl I feel like I look a fucking hot
mess like I am a little shook to the
ground right now I am not loving my eyes
okay we are going to try one more color
alright now when I first saw this
palette I was really excited for this
top shade cube up here it's like a white
beard iridescent type of metallic shade
but it has like a pink shift to it and
when I first saw it reminded me of the
pink heart highlighter and a moon child
glow kit which is one of my favorite
palettes I love this color it's going to
take another little pointer brush from
Cosette and I'm going to go right into
this pan here let's see what happens
okay okay
so you see it's coating the brush now
let's see what it looks like in the
inner corner that's what I want to see
okay so you do see some payoff
now this brush is dry of course as you
all saw I wish it was a little more
intense
I will wet it in a second I just want to
do both sides equally okay running bad
okay we're going to wet hair real
quickly let's dip in here again and here
we go with the wet brush oh wow that
really coated that nicely so let's go in
and let's see how it looks now okay it's
a little more subtle than I thought like
on camera I think with all the beauty
lights is definitely reflecting it's
just not as like varium as I thought it
was going to be but it is pretty I do
like the shift to it are you guys I
think I've played with enough colors in
this palette to give my final thoughts I
do quickly want to throw on some mascara
I am just going to go in with I just
reviewed this - let's give it a whirl
actually really like this the L'Oreal
lash paradise it is cute not as good as
that benefit one bitch but she ain't bad
so let me just quickly put on some
mascara and I'll be right back alright
you guys I am ready to give you my final
soft mascara is on and I'm looking in
the monitor and I'm like girl even with
all these Beauty lights I'm not feeling
that I feel messy is that weird
just past messy like no tea no shade
there is pigment on my brushes there is
fallout all over my makeup station my
hands are a mess the shirt girl who's
gonna pay for my dry-cleaning bill it's
messy that's just a no-brainer as you
can see also something I didn't like
with modern renaissance is the cells I
know a lot of you love this soft touch
but for someone that travels a lot it
just gets like kind of messy quickly I
almost wish it was like a leather or
like something else but there's like
brush hairs there's eyeshadow on here
and it's kind of hard to remove because
it is like that felt kind of like pool
table type of feel so let's open the
palette let's see what it looks like
after I have finished with it now I did
blow off all the fallout you can see in
the cracks in here and you can just see
how it all looks alright so these are
called bold metallics on the back and I
feel like these two were not like bold
they were not screaming in your face
metallic it was a lot of work too
these show up on my lids even with
concealer lay down my eyes were not
really having it of course the cube
color did show up here kind of but I'm
like girl not as great as I wanted it to
sorry I keep licking the monitor on
micro all-star that color I don't know
why
it definitely oxidized on my crease like
in there and on it it definitely did
like I'm sitting here looking and I'm
like what is this like this is like a
dark streak going up and then it turns
back into the color and I'm like girl I
told me you sad need index to the dark
web so that is definitely weird to me
it's tripping me out now maybe it's my
fault
is it the concealer did the colors not
want to go together but normally when
you blend colors together they don't
turn a color like that or that extreme
so that tripped me out the fallout of
course we've mentioned a million times
it has extreme fallout definitely I
think more fallout than the modern
renaissance palette I select this
formula maybe is a little better I'm not
sure if they change something I saw so
many people look at the ingredients and
compare them and they said that they
were different I know a lot of you
mentioned that mica was the first
ingredient in this for all the shadows
and then you flip this over and it says
talc is the main ingredient and there is
no mica right after it which a lot of
brands usually it says mica talc or calc
mica whatever the hell this one does not
say mica after it obviously I'm not a
chemist but I don't know if that has
something to do with it
untamed was probably one of the least
fallout of shades it wasn't that bad it
looks nice under my eyes it's a little
not like my favorite thing in the world
but it was a nice new wave oh my god
girl it like it was a mess it was a
little messy I will have to say that be
honest Ostia Beverly Hills sub-culture
eyeshadow palette is not Jeffrey star
I just kind of too much trouble with it
and I didn't love it I really didn't
love it you know when you like go into
something wanting to love it you're like
girl all these people are crazy and for
once I'm a little shocked that I'm kind
of agreeing with everyone I do not like
how this blended like I'm kind of mad at
myself and I want to wipe it off and
like do it again but girl I literally do
the same routine every single time you
guys know me by now it's the same song
and dance and it's the same steps and
this palette did not work for me of
course I am seeing a lot of people
online and on Instagram that are loving
it obviously makeup is makeup and we all
have our own experiences take away from
this review whatever you want this was
just my opinion my thoughts and my
experience I definitely do not love it
and I'm like girl I don't know what and
the hell is going on over here but my
eyes were not feeling it
overall it was kind of a Miss for me so
let me know your thoughts down below
sound off
what the hell do you think do you think
I don't know what do you think of
waiting about a damn tutorial so let me
know in the comment section down below
yeah that's it for today you guys thank
you so much for watching this review and
I will see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
