channel hi good morning how are you
alright you guys I am really really
excited for today's first impression
slash review because today we are going
to be testing out the brand new Fenty
Beauty galaxy collection just look at
the packaging for a second we just drink
it in
first of all Rihanna just came hard she
dropped her brand-new makeup line
in September like good morning you
bitches better wake the fuck up and here
we are already a month and a half later
and she has the Holiday Collection out
I'm like RiRi you better slow it down
baby girl so today you guys we are going
to dive into everything we got the lip
glitter glosses we got the hyper glitz
lipsticks we have liners and of course
we have the coveted galaxy eyeshadow
palette so we're going to play it with
all of this yumminess today I do want to
quickly read myself to filth
because my fenty video which I gotta say
thank you to everyone out there watches
my channel and appreciates my makeup
reviews because you guys have made my
Fenty Beauty review the number one most
watched FNT video on the internet and
I'm like girl y'all are fuckin crazy so
in that video I had filmed it in my
hotel room the day after the Rihanna
event right the big launch party a shade
matched myself with really dark lighting
and in the video a lot of you were like
oh my god the foundation turned really
orange on you it oxidized it got weird
what happened and I kind of never really
got to say my side of the story
I definitely shade match for myself
wrong and also I think a lot of people
forgot that I was filming with natural
daylight in a bed so my beauty lights
and everything that we're at home we're
definitely not there in New York so I
think it even looked crazier I apologize
now I am wearing my correct foundation
shade I'm sure you guys can tell now so
I actually like to mix because that's
just what I like to do I like to be
slightly a little more tanks I am so
pale so this is shade 140 and 170 I do a
big like three pumps of 140 and then I
do one pump of 170 and I mix it around
with the brush and then and also because
I know everyone's gonna be asking I am
also wearing the which shade is
this this is the kilowatt freestyle
highlighter duo and I am wearing the
shade on the right which is fire crystal
it is so pretty look at that mmm and of
course a lot of you are gonna be asking
me wow this is the gloss balm universal
lip Luminizer of course from venti as
well it's a Fendi video girl okay you
guys I think as I'm the dive into this
damn review let's see if this eyeshadow
palette works we're gonna do some
swatches of the lips and I can't wait to
get galactic so of course first product
that I have been dying to try is the
Fendi Beauty galaxy eyeshadow palette
here is the unit carton it has this
gorgeous I call it an oil slick metallic
feel to it all the packaging has the
same of course feel once you open it up
first of all on the back it does have
all the shades which is cool this says
that it is hyper reflective phenomenal
3d flex with infinite new dimensions so
this whole entire theme of the holiday
collection is of course called galaxy
it's very space in alien-themed which
I've been calling myself an alien since
eighth grade so I appreciate this and I
was really excited to see that
everything was sparkly and had that
really cool alien oil vibe is what I'm
gonna call it the oil slick so when you
open up the unit cart in this beautiful
jeweled like compact M comes out now I
love it it's very slim so you can travel
with it it's not too much on the back it
has all the shade names of course they
are all very Spacey we got Jupiter sand
Milky Way Lightyear Extra Terrestrial
cosmic ocean so they're all very like
space themed which I live for so let's
open her up
this feels expensive you guys know I do
not like cheap packaging and I'm always
telling you about it once you open it up
of course it has a beautiful nice
gigantic mirror which I always
appreciate let's just do a little
overview of these shades now this
palette is a limited edition it is a
glitter eyeshadow palette of 14 star
dusted shades designed to accessorize
any eye look so I think that that's very
important to know is because a lot of
you may think this is just like a normal
palette that you just take a brush and
you dig into and it's gonna have like
this crazy look so these eyeshadows are
going to have a
of different formulas it says here that
some are shear some are glittering
topcoats
to smoky shimmer drenched hues like
jewelry for your eyes hmm
you can use these with a brush and it
actually comes with a brush you guys so
let's talk about the brush real quick
here is the box of course the same type
of feel in the packaging now this brush
retails for $24 of course the eyeshadow
palette retailed for $59
now this once you open it up this is
called the galaxy 2 way I shadow brush
once you open it up here is what it
looks like now this brush you guys that
says is petite and smudges plush and
blends custom cut for the ultimate
glitter effect one side is going to
smudge obviously I'm gonna assume is
just a little one and then the other
side is going to blend out or it almost
feels like a packer brush so do i prime
my eyes with this what am I supposed to
do let's read the website now it says
from smokey iridescent violet to gold
glitter on mint galaxy is studded with
unique colors and glitter combos that
deliver a phenomenal 3d effect real
quickly you guys this says wear
eyeshadow solo for a sheer - smokey
effect so that I think is very important
to know so this is not gonna give you
some crazy light it's not gonna look
like you took loose glitter and it has
that type of moment it's gonna give more
of a like a really cool shift or it says
layer top coats over any eyeshadow for a
brilliant out-of-this-world boost and of
course it says for intense intensity wet
your brush which we all know you can do
that with anything whether it's
highlighting or eyeshadow if you want
the brush girl on a metallic you know
it's gonna pop well let's get ready to
do this look I'm going to dip into the
Mac painterly paint-pot and prime these
eyes and I like to use a little
synthetic brush now I do want to put
down a little bit of regular eyeshadow
so we can try topping them are you a top
or are you a bottom you think we should
use brushes we should use our finger and
we should just play around and have some
fun so I'm going to take a V androgyny
eyeshadow palette and I am just going to
take a little what is this the Bobbi
Brown eye blender and I'm just going to
dip into shade charm really quickly and
we are going to lay down a transition
shade and maybe put a little bit of the
green and blue in there just so we can
see if these works so I'm just going to
take this and put this right into the
crease alright we have the transition
shade down curve
we are blended all right so let's put in
a few more colors and get this show on
the road
so I am going to dip into shade poison
right now I'm just going to take this
and put this right in my deep set eyes
and my crease and hi it's fall people
dark green eye shadow is like I just
smoked out my eyes a little bit with of
course the shade of poison and charm
that's all I used so now we are ready to
move on to the galaxy palette I am going
to start off God they're all so pretty I
really want to try this one right here
called cosmic ocean it looks stunning
now where is that brush so I'm gonna try
to use this I heard you know when people
do those little Instagram tutorials I
saw people digging in and just kind of
going in only problem I have this long
nail that is in the way but I'm still
going to touch it ok it feels nice the
textures not too gritty so it's more
like a smoother texture and I'm just
gonna take this and put it in the inner
corner or try to because I have these
long ass fucking nails I'm just gonna
kind of put it right there
on the lid
let's see how it looks on the brush ok I
think it likes it like a little more
flaky with the brush without wetting it
I always wet my brush but I know a lot
of people are like well try both on
camera so we don't wet the brush we know
what it looks like and I'm like girl
so I wet the brush if you take this like
this you're gonna get some pigment and
this is easy this is of course this is
the smudger side so I'm just gonna take
this and oh yeah it's actually
depositing it totally fine okay girl but
if you do want to wet it which we're
about to try you definitely can now this
is of course a glitter type formula so
I'm just going to take a clean brush and
just sweep away the fallout or you can
just rub it into your skin because it's
glitter and why not all right so let's
wet the brush and let's see what happens
I'm going to take a little morphe
setting spray
we got her wetted down and now let's dip
into cosmic ocean now let's just put
that right in here oh okay definitely
intensify that hot damn baby
all right now we're gonna dip into shade
midnight bolt which is this one right
below that one now you guys this is
really pretty my eyes look like I was
like baby blue glass on it and the
glitter though I'm getting excited
alright so let's just take our finger
real quickly right here and oh that is a
really cool shade I'm gonna apply that
kind of in the middle on top of what we
already did and just press down and oh
wow this is a look it's a look so then
we're gonna leave a little bit of that
shade of poison right here and I'm just
gonna blend it together so it looks nice
alright I threw one some max smolder
liner in my waterline now these shades
girl
they got pigment now we're gonna go into
the shade god extraterrestrial so pretty
and so is sublime so extraterrestrial is
right here this looks so pretty looks
like a Japanese beetle like the shell of
it so I'm just gonna take a little bit
of that now that one looks like it has
like one of the formulas that has
glitter and pigment and not just like a
top coat so I'm gonna take this a little
bit right here and let's just press it
under my eye and let's see what happens
and love the shimmer and it's just an
easy way to smoke it out all right now
let's take this shade sublime right here
it's like an ether oh it almost looks
silver then you move it and then it's a
green ish like it's cool here I'll show
you with my finger a little bit see
there you go mmm-hmmm and the pan it
almost reads a little silver so I am
going to take this brush and I'm gonna
just dip it in and we're gonna go right
in here and I'm actually going to wet
the brush a little bit because Mama
wants high intensity alright then we're
just going to take the shadow and place
it right there huh
Wow there's a gold like kind of like
flakes in there glitter and bam whoa
that shade laid down really nicely now I
did want to try out the like kind of
shader blending site on this so I was
gonna dip into what are we gonna dip
into cloth there's so many shades I want
to try it we're gonna definitely have to
use this in another look so I'm just
gonna take this shade what is this one
Jupiter sand this one right here
look at how weird that looks it's such a
cool unique shade so I'm gonna dip in oh
it's like a brown to have a base okay so
I'm just gonna pop this a little bit
right in here I know I'm like maybe
going overkill with the shadows but I
just wanted to try it out okay the good
match is too closely to what I already
have in there but oh okay I see some
shimmer in there I do already know how I
feel about this palette I'm sure you can
gauge how pretty this I look is so we
will talk about it of course in the
outro but let's get to swatching the
eyeliners all right the next product we
are going to be talking about is the
eclipse two and one glitter a release
eye liner now I have two shades here
today we have never turned and we have
alien bay so here's what the component
looks like you get a wand I'm going to
assume wallah there she is whoa it
almost looks like black black but up
close you can see that it has like some
glitter reflex in there this retails for
$20 and I have two shades right here
they are both really dark like the bases
and I'm not sure what they do so let's
find out this is a limited edition
liquid eyeliner with a transforming
metallic to glitter formula that lets
you choose your own finish oh wow okay a
low-key metallic or high-impact Sparkle
this delivers both worlds in one of its
revolutionary blend of intense pigment
and pearl essence that dries to a sleek
metallic finish rub it when it's dry to
reveal a surprising glitter effect this
liner puts the power to go from data
play literally at your fingertips so we
are going to take shade
yes blue ones pretty cool okay alien Bay
I know my shadows are really crazy right
now but we are just going to put this
right across and let's see what happens
on my lid alright you guys let's just
put a little bit of this down
oh wow no I didn't do any lashes yet you
guys see I have mascara on because I
wanted to test out the liner alright so
I think what we do is I'm going to just
do a little dramatic wing here and let's
see if there's glitter on all right
there is a little wing aligner so let's
let this dry and let's try to rub her
out
alright you guys it is now dry so alien
bay is on this side and I put Knepp
turnt on this side it says to rub it
with your fingers I think
well it says rub when dry so what does
rub means I kind of use a clean brush
can I use a finger scared so I guess
we'll just try both maybe alright so I'm
gonna take my pinky and let's zoom in
right here and let's see oh my god I got
glitter all over me alright let's see
what happens
I mean definitely blue glitter came
through that is a trip like my fingers
clean that is a trip I want to try it
with like a brown classic smokey eye or
like something really simple because I
know I have a lot going on here but you
guys see that like this shit works okay
so let's do this side whoa look at the
green coming through and I'm barely
touching it you guys I'm not rubbing
hard I'm like kind of just really
finessing it and oh look at that bitch
okay let's move on to the lip section of
this review so we are going to talk
about the BAM the starlet hyper glitz
lipstick of course this is another
limited edition item now there are four
shades here we are going to swatch a few
in my mouth and a few of my hands so
this is a limited edition of metallic
lipstick that's a buildable to the
ultimate dual chrome finish this is a
shimmering lip color that delivers a
look and feel of your favorite lip balm
dipped in liquefied jewels the component
looks like this and this is supposed to
be a color soaked micro shimmer reflect
chrome sheen it can be built up to your
desire level impact I love I just love
the description of these products it has
a creamy texture you are gonna get glitz
- the grit so your looks feel and look
beyond stellar let's open this up and
see so of course we have the FB banty
Beauty logo right there we have the of
course celeb line and these do feel
sturdy and nice so here's the lipstick
now people get mad if you don't roll up
all the products these days so let's go
all the way to the top alright so that
is how much product you get that is a
good amount of product now let's see on
the box it says that it is 0.45 ounces I
do have all four shades here I'm just
gonna swatch it on my hand let's just
see what this even looks like this one
is called cyfle eye I live for these
names Rihanna
alright so oh this is like a peachy like
orange cream soda type of vibe
love it so that is what that one looks
like let's open the other well which one
is this one okay I got the shade names
wrong this one is called super moon okay
don't read me to hell this one is super
moon this one is called psy fly Wow look
at that coloring so let's put that one
right here oh I even want to put this
like over a black lipstick imagine girl
so that is what that one looks like
excuse my hands to watch as y'all know
y'all know I'm not the best it's
watching on my hand alright so let's
move on we got two other shades we have
Oh what is this baby this one is super
nova oh wow
okay that one already look sickening and
then there's another one called gravity
let's open up her right here oh wow
okay first of all we wipe off this gloss
real quickly and apply one of these so
be right back
all right here's shade at gravity let's
give her a whirl and I did a foundation
on my mouth so excuse me I did wipe off
that and the gloss so let's go in
mmm literally no grit at all not gritty
you don't feel the glitter there's
really not like a smell with this one
love it okay I've also been dying to try
the other one which was Supanova so I'm
just going to quickly go like this to
see Oh motherfucker that one is so
pretty too damn look at that like Sheen
okay so these ones they're pretty bomb
now there is only for shade but there's
also for lip glitters let's move on to
those last but not least we have the
cosmic gloss lip glitter oh I've been
dying to try these okay so here is what
the unit carton it looks like these have
a 0.34 fluid ounces and just like these
guys they are $19 let's read a little
bit about it now there are four shades
and the component looks like this they
look really really pretty the glitter
looks really really nice I'm like okay
so these guys are a ultimate triple
threat of creamy color glitter and shine
well I'm already living for that this is
going to let's see what we got your guys
your a distant glitter drenched in a
mirror-like shine for a mega dose of
multi-dimensional shimmer in one swipe
unlike other glitter lip glosses this is
designed to be unbelievably smooth and
creamy for out-of-this-world shine plus
phenomenal comfort I love that all right
well let's see if it's really real let's
try spacesuit that is this guy right
here oh my god it's like creme brulee
vanilla like I'm fucking hungry I have
the munchies okay so the dough foot
looks like this it is large and flat and
let's just go directly on the mouth hmm
whoa so there's the difference of no
lipgloss with the product only down here
and girl that is really shiny and I okay
now we're going to just touch our lips
together doesn't stick doesn't feel
weird it doesn't look gummy at all like
look at the glitter and the pearls in
here like I'm living for this formula
okay so I loved how the doe foot was
long so it really got my entire lip I
didn't even have to dunk twice this is
literally one dunk in and it covered
like my whole mouth so that is pretty
impressive and smell so pretty this is a
good formula right you guys I think
we've tested out everything here I do
want to quickly swatch a few of these
just because they look so pretty oh my
god and imagine this over like a
lipstick so sorry I know my head has a
bunch of glitter on it but we will just
test right here oh my God look at that
dirt dirt okay and then I have to swatch
this one because it looks so damn pretty
in the bottle first of all that last one
was cold plutonic a relationship and
then this other one is called gal on the
moon I thought it looks so stunning in
the bottle so I know my hands are not
the best but look at that pigment like
oh wow those are stunning alright you
guys so I think we have tried out enough
I think I know my final thoughts so
let's get into it
alright you guys so the Fenty beauty
collection the galaxy collection first
of all let's go through everything
alright so I just kind of want to put it
out there that this was a really fun
video to do I loved all the glitters I
loved all the formulas and reona you
made makeup fun again for me thank you
for that today
all right so let's move on to the
products the galaxy eyeshadow palette I
think was really pretty and definitely a
unique idea I mean you really don't see
full glitter shimmer eyeshadow palettes
on the market you usually see always a
mix obviously it's mattes and metallics
and shimmers and everyone's always all
over the place so to have an entire
palette dedicated to a glitter
definitely a unique idea
I loved it the formulas were great of
course it's glitter you're gonna have a
little bit of fall out it's not gonna
blend like a normal shadow and I love
how clear they were on the site and on
the packaging of exactly how they were
going to perform so the palette a plus
love it let's move on to the liners now
I'm not always a liner type of person
but this formula was great it was a very
opaque as you see the glitter activated
immediately when I touched it and I
loved it it was definitely something new
on the market it reminded me of the
where is it the glitter flip lipstick
when I went on the review a month ago we
all know what this is by now it reminded
me of that in a I form these ones are
really cool they were different and a
unique makeup product on the market
which is kind of hard to do nowadays so
I liked that now let's move on alright
let's go to the lipsticks these were fun
these aren't really up my alley I don't
normally like slim line lipsticks I love
a normal like big stick but these ones
were really cute I liked the formula
they were not gritty at all they had a
really nice coverage they were metallic
and they did exactly what um you know
they said so these are definitely cute
and the pink ones are gonna be going in
my purse alright and quickly before we
move on to the last thing this eyeshadow
brush even though I am always shading
brands they put the cheapest brushes
with their eyeshadow palettes distant
perform it did work it didn't feel too
rough you know sometimes you get a brush
with the palette and you're like my eyes
bleeding this one did not do that at all
and it actually did what it said which I
appreciate
last but not least of course the lip
glitter glosses now obviously I'm
wearing it I've been wearing it and went
downstairs and I drank a root beer float
and put on this way
and the gloss is still really pretty I
love it the formula is beautiful
so I was shocked I had no idea what to
expect I've been hearing things
throughout the makeup community about
what everything is and I had no idea
really what to expect but I'm like okay
there's a lot of products here I'm
definitely gonna not like at least one
of them I'm wrong
Rihanna you did that baby so the Fenty
Beauty galaxy collection and I can't
believe I'm saying this but the entire
collection is jeffree star approved BAM
bitch it was beautiful I can't wait to
take this to Finland I am leaving
literally you guys tomorrow I will be in
Finland for a week we're doing a big
makeup convention so if you are from
Europe or Finland I will leave it linked
down below and if the rest of you are
like girl we don't live there we don't
care then keep on watching or don't keep
on watching because the video is about
the end all right you guys this
collection was really awesome
