that just like Kylie Kim took me off the
PR list she can actually take some
criticism what's up everybody
welcome back to my channel hi oh yeah
all right you guys so today we are going
to dive in into the brand new k'kaw
mario collaboration now I have seen so
many posts about this all over the
internet I'm like baby I gotta try this
out for myself now you know on my
channel you're gonna get the truth and
nothing but the truth so help me God
here is the PR package it came in this
box like this now this box you guys it
feels heavy I know it looks a little
simple from the outside but let's open
her up and this collection does include
one full eyeshadow palette and you see
two lip glosses here and one lipstick so
of course today we are going to swatch
these colors we're gonna play with the
lip glosses and of course try on the
lipstick now before we dive into this
review I want to let everyone know that
next month RuPaul's Drag Cohn finally
returns to Los Angeles may 11 12 and 13
myself and my entire brand will be there
selling my makeup and of course I will
be doing a huge meet-and-greet so who's
coming do you guys do you want tickets

and get 10% off of course everything
will be linked down below I know that a
lot of people travel from all over the
world to go to this so I cannot wait to
see everyone and of course my brand is
coming back as a main sponsor for the
event so I will see you all i repulse
drag Con alright so let's take out this
eyeshadow palette this is of course I
think the star of the show and then I'm
going to pop out these glosses of course
to try later but let's just go over the
collection now now I must say that for a
PR box this is very cute it's very
minimalistic now I do want to say that I
know you guys are gonna try to read me
and say Jeffrey I know you're all about
packaging and yes I am but let's talk
about the people who made this
collaboration which of course is Kim's
brand k'kaw and Mario na Mario is of
course an iconic makeup artist who has
been doing Kim's makeup for 10 years now
and they have done so many looks
together whether you are a fan of Kim or
not you cannot deny that her makeup has
definitely made waves and her in JLo
definitely did the staple contour and
highlight trend that got everyone in a
craze over the last few years so in
talking about this we're gonna talk
about the formula we're gonna talk about
how much it costs and we're gonna see if
it really works this is the palette of
course you guys know I love bougie crazy
packaging and my mad that this is great
and minimalistic no because Kim herself
is not crazy and into rainbows and
unicorns so I'm not that mad at it what
I do wish is that this was like a hard
plastic or like it weighed as much as my
ass but I'm not mad at it this is easy
for travel and it's Kim and Mario's
palette baby so let's open it up okay
because they're not all about the crazy
packaging but once you open it up BAM
there are the colors so of course you
guys can see Miss Powell it does come
with ten shades and this will retail for
forty five dollars now when looking at
the colors I know that that blue is
popping out and there's a lot of people
online that were like Jeffrey this looks
like Kylie speech palette baby there are
so many brands that have blues of course
there may be a similarity when you
compare a palette that has blue but this
is its own thing and this is a very Kim
K like when I saw this I was like yeah
those are literally the colors I always
see her in this is very I think Mario
and Kim and not blue I know a lot of you
were like don't use the blue everyone
else had how can you not dive into their
like let's just take a clean finger
right now and do a little swatching
please well they feel creamy okay honey
I'm not mad at it there is definitely a
high-quality pigment there we will see
how it blends and looks on the eye of
course now the shade names are listed on
the back some of them are really cute
Libra Hyatt my mom's a Libra so what
else is in the collection there are two
high shine lip glosses these retail for
$18 each we have super nude which is a
pale sheer nude with gold pearl and then
we have a shade called juicy which is a
peach with subtle pink pearl of course
I'm gonna have to try this on later the
last item in his collection is BAM this
cream lipstick this will retail for
twenty dollars and it is called classic
Kay now when I first saw this I was like
girl what the fuck liked Kim what is
going on but it is supposed to I guess
mimic a crystal I mean at first I was
like
I'm not sure about it you guys it's
giving me drugstore it's giving me wet
and wild and then when they explained
that it's kind of supposed to be a geode
or like a crystal moment I get it I'm
just like girl I expected a little more
with this let's keep it real besides the
packaging will of course see if the
formula works if the product works do we
really care what's in it I think yes but
what do you guys think
sound off below alright enough talking
let's see what the palette looks like on
the eyes and let's get to swatching so I
am gonna swatch a few of these just to
see what the formula feels like now
shade 2008 right here is oh it feels
nice it's creamy
definitely I'm Alex blinding actually
let's see how it looks right there BAM
okay honey they're not playing with that
now this shade is called the glam and oh
wow very soft very like BAM so a little
tidbit on these eyeshadows I do want to
read what they're supposed to do before
we wear them these are formulated for
easy layering and blending matte shadows
provide a creamy powdery finish okay and
then the smooth metallic shadows can be
used wet or dry with brushes or fingers
okay and now it also says they glide on
effortlessly and provide a saturated
pearlized color finish it says that this
palette will give you dimension to your
favorite makeup looks alright so let's
start our mouth and get you're trying it
but I just want to feel one of the matte
shades just oh okay that quality though
there it is look at me just finger
swatch it all over my hands okay there's
definitely pigment on that mat okay it's
not powdery it doesn't feel dry hey
y'all but let's see if it works on the
eyes so I am going to quickly prime my
lids where's my primer we are going to
quickly prime my lids a little mac paint
pot right here and yes you guys I've
been wearing makeup everyday straight so
my eyelashes may look a little janky
with some glue on there just pretend
it's not there first we're gonna take a
shade a decade right here which is a
soft kind of bone ivory color and I'm
going to take a big brush that normally
used for highlighting but I'm just gonna
take that because eyebrows so last year
and I'm gonna take that and take it all
over my lid and I was
it does have a nice mirror so if you
were someone that likes to do your
makeup with a pallet or you're always on
the go you can definitely use this
mirror because it actually works
sometimes you know what pallet is
extending with the mirror so little
you're like what was the point honey
alright so there is a little bit of
fallout it's an eyeshadow palette and
not shocking there but overall this
color definitely has payoff I'm just
gonna take that and put it up my brow
bone most UV will maybe just put it on
your lid and not take it this high up
but for all my aliens out there this is
necessary now we're gonna go into shade
Miami right here which is that warm
toned camel color and we're just gonna
put this in our crease a little bit this
palette there's so many looks you could
do with it and I'm sure you're all like
what are you gonna do don't do the blue
bitch I have to do some sort of blue it
is so pretty
first impressions right away hi it's
blending it has pigment and yeah that's
the story so far people so now that
that's laid down let's take a brush with
no product and we're just gonna go in
real quickly and blend and that oh just
so it's soft and subtle alright now
we're gonna go into the shade Albania or
right about here and it is like a warm
reddish brown I love it we're just gonna
go in with a little synthetic brush
right here that we initially used and
we're just going to pack that halfway on
our lids so I'm just gonna kind of go
this way and go up now when I'm
reviewing something I like to see if it
actually blends together with the
shadows sometimes you'll get a pallet
and you blend the colors together and
you're like what is this mud but so far
so good
alright and then you get a little pulled
out look I'm gonna take this brush again
we're gonna dip into albania again and
this one and just kind of go back and
forth and now we're just gonna take this
brush just kind of drag it out a little
bit like that and if you want to stop on
that of course we can go back in again
with that shade and just go over it whoa
no let's go into shade armenia which is
this gold color right here okay so
usually what I do metallic shade you
guys I'll do my finger or we'll go in
with like this type of brush so let's go
in with a pencil brush and see if
anyone's to stick on my lid there we go
so that is soft and subtle very Kim but
it says you can use them wet I'm more of
a wet person not that any of you were
shocked
so let's wet this brush right here there
we go don't like a dry ho do not like a
dry ho guys so let's go back in and ook
the brush is coated there we go I'm like
girl subtle is cute once in a while but
I'm the antithesis of style and then
we're just gonna tuck that and bring it
right there and stop it alright now
we're gonna take shade 2008 with this
same wet brush and we're just gonna dive
into there oh wow this one is like
coating the brush and we are going to
tuck this color right in the inner
corner we're gonna mix it with the gold
oh wow look at that on camera bitch like
she's intense and then we're gonna bring
her down a little bit right here just to
the edge does anyone else into edging or
the bowling no great okay BAM
we are sparkling those shadows are
actually like no I don't know what to
expect with this palette but the
metallics so far so good now we're going
to go back in the shade up here once
again and go and bitch I've been going
in on that and now we are gonna put some
blue down here but I do want to just
shade a little bit under here just so
it's easy to blend later so this is just
a little pre base if you will and then
we will dive into that blue metallic and
see if it has pigment I'm quickly going
to pop in some Mac smolder eye pencil
just to give my eyes a little bit of
dimension and depth when I'm doing the
blue I definitely want some drama
so we'll just pack that right in there
now we're finally going to dive into
shade Libre which is the iconic blue
shade that Kim has been wearing for a
long time now I know a lot of people
have done blues with their looks how
could you not now that coded the brush a
very easily so I'm gonna assume this has
a lot of pigment
and now we're gonna go back into shape
Miami and we're going to take the brush
and go right under the blue and just
smoke it out under so that brown
undertone is coming underneath the blue
and it's like oh whoa good morning
there we have it I'm living now what
else is missing definitely some mascara
and a lash so I will be right back
lashes are on it definitely completed
this look though I did use six out of
the ten shades in the palette the other
ones I will definitely have to try it
later on I will give you my final
thoughts in a minute after we do some
lip swatches so let's dive in to the two
glosses and one lipstick from this
collection and let's see what the real T
is now this lipstick of course it's
called classic k now besides the
packaging is a formula good or not first
of all let's clear our nose and see what
it smells like not really a fragrance it
just kind of smells like lipstick now
let's swatch this on my hand and let's
see the color ooh okay one swipe
coverage very creamy and it has sort of
a satin sort of finish so let's just go
right in and put this on our mouths okay
that went on very easy Wow okay now the
packaging I do not love I definitely
think if this is gonna be Kim K it
should have been like way crazier but I
know a lot of you don't care about the
packaging so let's talk about the
formula one swipe coverage it feels very
creamy it's like hmm it's like it's
comfortable you guys it is not draggy it
doesn't feel weird it kind of feels
really lightweight but that coverage I'm
like I can't get over how pretty this
color is though I'm like mmm
that's a good-ass lipstick a formula I
will say that all right now the two
glosses let's swatch them and see what
happens now we have super nude and juicy
super nude it looks to be the lighter
one so let's just do a little swatch
right next to the lipstick okay it
definitely looks wet ish and of course
it's a gloss it's
to be all right now we got shade juicy
Oh that noise that noise okay this is a
more yeah peachy nude gloss that would
probably look really stunning or gold
actually both would look stunning so
let's just take this for fun I'm just
gonna put this or oh no oh yeah it's
making it really pretty wow that is very
pretty I'm like oh girl alright so since
we just applied the lips let's give our
final thoughts on that now packaging not
living for this but overall the formula
one swipe coverage it was very easy to
put on and it literally happened in like
one second it was like bam bam hi it's
on
it feels amazing now the glosses
packaging for me it's still a little
underwhelming to me it's like steel up
magnificent metals but you know nothing
mind-blowing I think it's very
sophisticated and easy and maybe that's
their style it may not be for me but hey
it's a lip gloss now the lip gloss
formula that's what I'm more importantly
concerned about it looks really pretty I
can't get over this lip combo I'm like
wow this is just like uh-huh keep
looking in the monitor cuz it's just so
shiny usually after like five minutes a
gloss of me I'm like kind of take this
off because it just starts to get really
weird so the formula for these glasses
are pretty bomb all right so the glosses
and the lipstick formula are definitely
a twin in my book under the palette
overall you guys I am impressed with the
shadow formula I know that they haven't
really done a palette before and a lot
of people love to compare this to her
sisters palettes but I gotta be honest
these shades felt a lot more like creamy
and they just kind of blend it out a lot
better than some of the Kylie pilots
like no shade now I'm sure that Mario
and Kim worked really hard on this
formula it definitely shows because the
shadows blend it out really nicely now
of course again I am a packaging whore I
do not live for this packaging but it is
what it is people you can't please
everyone is the Kim K k'kaw Mario
collaboration collection Jeffrey Stehr
approved
yes it's jeffree star approved you
cannot deny a good formula whether you
love a brand or you love packaging or
not if the formula works it works
overall trust me y'all I know you guys
are gonna be like but but the formulas
were amazing what do you guys think I
know a lot of you are over celebrities
and their makeup brands is it becoming a
big trend yes there is a lot of other
celebrities I've seen that are working
on stuff we got J Lo's bronzer we have
Gwen Stefani working on a line and there
are so many others but there's a lot of
fish in the sea and definitely a lot of
room in this makeup community so we'll
see who survives but what do you guys
think of today's video sound off below
what did you like what didn't you like
keep it real with me guys all right I
will see you on the next video
mwah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
