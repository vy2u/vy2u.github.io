channel hi how the hell are ya now today
we're gonna be talking about the
infamous and the controversial tart
shaped cake foundation now listen girl
we're gonna have to start this video off
with a few words because I am just at a
loss right now I'm at a loss for words
but I also got a lot of shit to say so
if you've been sleeping under a rock or
maybe you've been busy working or
fucking your husband I have something to
share with you this picture hit the
internet last week and it was announced
that Tarte was putting out a brand new
foundation to go along with their famous
shaped tape concealer now I was very
excited because this is one of my
favorite concealers of 2017 now I know
this actually came out all the way in 16
which is important to know this
foundation first launched in 2016 2017
it grew into a monster everyone fell in
love with it or most of you did
including myself so when there was a
announcement that there was gonna be a
foundation version a lot of us were like
yes it might be the new holy grail it
better be amazing there was a lot of
hype and then the swatches came out so
if you have not seen this this was going
around online and is basically
showcasing tarts shade range for their
new foundation so I sat here and I was
like crickets that's what I that's what
happened so let's have a conversation
you guys last year Breanna came in the
game and she slayed everybody she
basically said hi everyone let's be
inclusive and if you're not you gotta go
and it was such a beautiful launch
Rihanna had a foundation color for
almost literally every one every skin
tone every undertone every complexion
she came in so laid no thief NT Beauty
foundation is actually one of my
favorites from last year it is amazing
and the brand definitely put things in
perspective for a lot of people that
high if a brand does not have a big
shade range why bother and I know
there's a lot of opinions about this but
girl here's mine if you cannot create a
all-inclusive shade range why is the
product even being
out there was a lot of controversy that
went down with this and I am just kind
of a little shocked and horrified when I
saw this watches it looked like they had
50 shades of white and then like two
shades for women of color and I'm it's
not acceptable
it is literally 2018 so I know a lot of
people have done videos on this
foundation already it's just hit the
market
but I have a few more words to say so
I've seen a few youtubers already review
this now there was an amazing review by
Jackie aina and Alyssa Ashley you can
watch their video here is the thumbnail
and they really go in depth and just
they're just brutally honest and I think
that's why a lot of people fuck with our
channel it's because they say exactly
what's up they speak the truth and a lot
of people are afraid of the truth part
of me didn't even want to review the
foundation I know a lot of you want to
see in action so I am gonna do it but
part of me just feels like girl unless
they want to put out a full-range don't
bother so while I'm filming this video
tart actually went on their IG story and
did a little we're gonna call a press
release or a response to the controversy
and everyone being upset now let's read
this together and you guys can decide
what you think for yourself so tart went
on there IG story which girl you should
have done a full post on Instagram you
should have posted on Twitter Facebook
everything so the whole world could see
your response but I guess an Instagram
story will have to do we all know by now
that we revealed our much anticipated
shaped tape foundation and the final
shade range that we launched was
definitely not a full rapid
representation of all of you it may be a
little too late but we can assure you
that this was not meant in any malicious
way we all just got so caught up in the
shape tape nation and seeing your tweets
asking for it we wanted to get the
product out as fast as possible and we
made the decision to move forward before
all the shades were ready to go they
then go on to say we know that there is
no excuse and we take full
responsibility for launching this way we
lost sight of what's really important in
this industry and for those who feel
alienated in our community we want to
personally apologize we're doing
everything in our power to bring those
unfinished shades to market as fast as
we can at any cost
we can and we will do better also one
thing I want to note is that a lot of
people were going in because Tarte
disabled their comment section for the
post about the foundation so it really
made people even more upset like you're
literally
I don't think the voices of those who
need to be heard now it is great to have
an apology but to me I feel like some of
that is maybe a little too late a woman
of color and afterthought to tert are
they not good enough so you got to wait
to get your shade later I just couldn't
imagine being excited for a release now
that concealer that they have put out
does have a lot of shades but I couldn't
imagine being excited for a launch and
then you log in to buy your shade and
you can't find your color and it really
does not exist I mean to me foundation
should go from A to Z tart did like a to
M skipped a whole bunch and then did
like you Z and that's about it so to me
it just felt like okay why would you
have to put out darker shades later
so only white people get to buy your
shit first and then everyone is like an
afterthought it blows my mind but I
think that this is a very important
topic to talk about and I think that it
is also something that a lot of brands
kind of you know put under the radar
don't bother putting out this foundation
until you are ready with a full
inclusive line so another thing that was
a little controversial the last two days
is that beauty youtuber at
nikkietutorials deleted her entire shape
tape review and I was like whoa what is
going on
so after digging in I found out that she
deleted the video because people were
really going in on the comment section
and you know the Internet is the
Internet and this is a very hot topic
but I think that it's very important
that when you do have a huge platform
like Nikki with over 8 million
subscribers you do not that you have to
do things a certain way but you do have
a choice to really talk about something
and bring it full forward because yes
girl they may have had your shade but
half your audience then you have their
shade so me which I know I don't have as
many subscribers as her but I would like
to be one of the people to go on record
and start the conversation which the
conversations already started the whole
internet is fucking up roared angry and
upset and I just think that people with
a bigger audience should speak up about
it it's ridiculous
you know I saw Nikki's tweet she said
you know I got to pull up the screenshot
so I don't misquote thank you for
showing me the importance of showcasing
my voice the tart shade range is an
absolute
and I should have spoken up about it
more than I did my problem with that
you've been on YouTube for eight years
you know you have a voice girl so you
live your life online
you saw the shade range you didn't
really acknowledge it so here I am
I would love to acknowledge it and start
the motherfucking conversation I just
feel like that is a very important topic
and please sound off below of what you
guys think I'm very just kind of like
shocked to even see this behavior still
happening in the makeup world but at
last here we are so if you guys want to
see me even review this foundation keep
on watching if you're over I don't blame
you you can log off I don't care but I
do want it to you know speak my mind and
I think that it's very important to talk
to you guys about this subject let's
dive into it now there is two formulas
there is a hydrating shaped tape and
there is a mat shaped tape now I have
watched a few people review this which I
normally don't do not that anyone sways
my opinion I just don't like to see
other people use it yet until I try it
out but from watching a few people's
reviews the hydrating one seems very
skin-like and natural which No thank you
we're gonna try out the matte one so it
looks like this now I did get three
shades here which all jokes aside you
guys I can't with the shade names we got
lights and fair neutral and light
neutral now the other shades were like
deep dark and mahogany and I'm over here
like so anyway I am going to test this
out today now this foundation does
retail for $39 it's kind of up there
this one is supposed to visibly refine
pores and absorb shine it has a vitamin
E for nourishing the skin no flaking or
caking now it does recommend that you
apply with a paddle brush so they have
put out their own brush which this
retails for $28 it's vegan and cruelty
free now of course you guys have seen
every brand on earth I think right now
put out a paddle brush we all know that
our teeths was the first one to do it
and everyone has followed suit we're
just gonna dive in and try this
foundation now of course I'm gonna use a
primer that I always use everyday so
there's no surprises and since this is a
matte foundation we're gonna go in with
my sicily double tendency are instant
and long-term primer this one is amazing
she's fuckin pricey but
girl does she work all right my neck my
ears my forehead my whole face is primed
now let's dive in so I guess we have to
shade match my face first let's do that
now first of all I haven't even seen
this bottle yet really having absorb it
okay it's cute it's alright what do we
have here we have 30 milliliters and
12.01 fluid ounces made in canada and
this is of course a full mat foundation
all right now let's see which shade is
going to work for me the concealer I use
is very light now this I'm just gonna do
a little swatch test I probably should
have done this before I primed but hey
see what happens here okay that looks a
little yellow for me I am a very cool
toned so I don't think I'm gonna live
for that one this one is which one is
this one fair neutral
oh god that's light okay and then we
have light neutral let's pray light
neutral work so we're gonna have to go
in with that one you guys I'm scared
okay and then we have let yea this is
light neutral okay I think light neutral
is it gonna work alright you guys so I'm
going to wipe this off but we're gonna
go in with light neutral it's a little
too yellow for me there's not like that
full pink undertone I'm seeing here now
I did get this off line so you know how
it is when you're trying to match your
shade off of a little square it can be a
little annoying sometimes so we were
going to just wipe that off and then I'm
very worried about reviews you guys know
I'm gonna wipe this even the residue of
the makeup wipe i want completely off my
skin there we go
alright so here we are with Missa light
neutral now I know this is a very thick
foundation so during reviews you should
probably use a normal amount so everyone
can actually see if the product works or
not so let's just go in with one swipe
here oh that's a lot of product girl and
then we'll go down a little bit and
let's just see how that looks I mean
that's a lot of product we'll do half my
face just so you guys can see if and
when there's a difference now let's take
the brush and let's blender out
here is the foundation blended out so I
guess we're gonna have to zoom in right
here and see now of course I'm gonna
look directly in the camera here is the
side with foundation of course and here
is what you see in real life we have
freckles we have a little cut on my lip
we have moles and we have some
discoloration and then here is the now
looking in the monitor
it does look a very airbrushed all the
discoloration is gone it is definitely a
medium to full coverage foundation the
color match I'm not like living for but
I've also not hating it
it is definitely can be build it to a
very full coverage now there's no
patches it looks smooth it's very like I
look like I have a filter on my face
what you guys know I'm into that
my guess let's apply more on this side
but I love applying my foundation with
the Beauty Blender most of you guys know
that so even though this brush does say
its suggest to apply this with the
foundation not everyone is gonna buy
this or want to use it so let's try to
this side with a Beauty Blender now this
applicator actually don't mind it it
goes on really easy it's not messy and I
do like how sturdy it is because it is
I'm going to assume this is glass it
feels nice and heavy
okay let's bounce
all right so this is kind of weird
blending it out with a damp beauty
blender made it apply better than their
brush I have to say that right off the
bat I'm like whoa
now brands always recommend buy a brush
with this girl its foundation you can
apply it with your fingers with a sponge
with a Beauty Blender with a synthetic
brush whatever you want girl but just
buffing this in actually applied better
almost feel like this side with the
brush looks a little k here but this
cider looks a lot better when I wasn't
hating this side it just now that I'm
comparing the two I'm like whoa this one
is a nicer I am going to add a tiny bit
more of this just to see if it will let
me add on some extra coverage and let's
see what happens now that it's buffed
out you can definitely see it is a
medium to full coverage foundation there
is no denying that I am curious to see
if this shape tape concealer works great
over its own formula so let's pull out
the concealer of course this is in shade
fair and let's put some on and see what
happens
all right should we try to buff it out
with their brush or should we just stick
to a beauty sponge I guess we can do
both right why not okay so yeah this is
blended out all right it kind of took
off a little bit of the foundation it
looks like let's see this right here and
if a lot of you're like girl what the
hell are you doing right there this is
what I've been doing lately under my
contour just so it's so sharp and your
cheekbones look like knives but yeah
this brush girl I'm not living for it
alright now I'm going to set my
concealer like I would always do and
let's go in with the RCM a no color
powder now we're gonna take our damp
sponge and we're just going to lay that
right on top of the concealer and the
foundation and let's see how it looks as
I'm letting the powder bake I'm just
adding on a little bit of bronzer and
warmth to my face oh right so let's
brush off the powder here and let's see
how the under eyes and concealer are
looking alright so I think I'm ready to
give my final thoughts and give you guys
the real tea so here we go so I'm sure a
lot of you are wondering and you want to
know maybe you've already fast forwarded
to the end is the tart shaped cake
foundation jeffree star approved well
here's the problem the formula yes it's
good it's not the best thing on earth
now what I did put the concealer over
the foundation with the setting powder
it does look good there's really no
creasing it's not bad if my problem is I
really don't know if we should support
this foundation or the brand until there
are more shades and I'm sure a lot of
you are gonna be on the same page as me
and you're like girl I agree so I'm glad
that you guys got to watch me play
around with it but I'm not going to
improve it based on all the facts that I
presented in the beginning of the video
I hope you guys can understand that and
relate because girl I can not until the
brand wants to be fully inclusive maybe
y'all should not be wasting your fucking
hard-earned coins on it and that is that
I'm gonna go wipe this off now but I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
