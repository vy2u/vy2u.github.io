thousands of people telling me that if I
want to do a real mukbang what's the
official yes I wanted to do a real one
the Queen so like like literally I feel
like only icons are on this channel and
I was like I don't know what I'm doing
here so I'm because I was blocked by
Jeffery and we're gonna talk about that
yeah and I loved it immediately clocked
motherfucking T and we're gonna get
everything out in the open and try a lot
of talk about there's a lot of new stuff
on the menu that I've never tried before
now I'm a really picky here you may not
know this about me okay good try know
what you like I've literally had sex at
every race but we are in the yes like
Nate's made me breakfast in bed
sometimes QR so she is breaking the
virginity of filming in the real star
bed this is not a prop this is my crazy
eight foot by 10 foot bed we had
custom-made
I know bougie a spot it's all
hand-carved wood it took five months to
make and I'm very proud of it even
though I didn't do it virginity of the
bed with you here we feel so like I'm so
excited for multiple reasons also
because I love like for me I get off and
like being where people have sex like
picture everything happening several
people joining us in here solos we've
had just the place to do that and that's
like this is it so look you don't we're
gonna eat all this shit
hopefully you're home and eating with us
and watching along okay I have a
confession
you've made me obsessed and I had no
idea what's gonna happen to me the show
I'm fully addicted like makeups my
entire world but this is now my second
hobby also before we really fully dive
in everyone we also have a video on
Chris's channel doing some crazy
shopping and hanging out great I know
and our friendship together so that will
be all linked down below and of course
please subscribe to her channel if
you're not already both expose and the
glue friends they'll be like Geoffrey

never watch average every XIV or guess
what we don't care about anything we're
done good like 30 minutes yeah I don't
mind a we gonna be he no I love like I'm
accepting with my what happened I just
love when his hair in my mouth
oh my dear dogs and open eight are they
real the nails or the diamond diamond
yeah or real me over here with my
imitations
can you even tell the difference yeah
okay I'm gonna get the elephant out of
the room ready so a lot like a year I
think like it almost a year now ago
trisha tweeted like oh my god Geoffrey
start blocking and I was like sure a few
years ago when all the crazy mess is
going down with my ex best friend of ten
years backstabbing in front of the
internet you made a video that was like
life advice to Geoffrey in that moment
and I'm honest Scorpio I don't give a
fuck I'm all about talking about my
feelings no I love this I mean those
first few months it was really hard like
it was devastating yeah someone you
really love and care about for such a
long time to be so loyal to hurt you and
lie about you it was like devastating in
that moment looking back it was like wow
good learning experience yeah you're not
gonna be friends to everyone forever
people are very shady with success comes
a lot of you know demons you can whether
it's family friends whatever your people
start to switch and get weird so in
those for a few months when your video
came out I was just in such a negative
headspace and people work oh my god sure
made a video talking to you like that
yeah I'm so sensitive I was like block
frame yeah watch the full thing yeah you
know what sucks is when you had people
in your ear and they're like telling you
like it just makes it worse
yeah like certain people I don't want a
name or like oh my god you guys she's
shading me fuck her and yeah in a really
hurt moment I'm at my you know my
fucking Lois yeah I didn't block you
like right here I'm just like oh my god
I'm not doing this right now because I
was so hurt by the whole situation and I
do with you yeah I looking back it was
immature nishan have done it and I love
the now we're best friends when you went
on cheese podcast I was there that same
day and I think Geoffrey hates me like
he's blocked me like I literally chained
I lived for you but at the time I was
watching a bunch is like drama channel
so everyone's making me do something I
didn't do
and that's the Sun that's so real and
I'm loving yeah so right now it's really
hot in cali I'm currently sweating my
asshole sweating a lot and I don't mind
I love no sweat is everything it turns
me on feels like fucking I know there's
something wrong here twice and it like
scarred my teaching Jeffrey started to
be a bad role model for Mary can I tell
some real fucking tea yeah yeah I was
going to do a collaboration with Taco
Bell I'm sure the world watching is not
shocked I gave them so much clout with
the cinnamon delight it was like
actually a little like a like a
phenomenon bang yes old astronomical and
I couldn't believe it again anyway and
they reached out to me and we were
talking for a minute but I am just too
controversial yeah I run my mouth too
much and I'm just too like honest um and
I I hate that like you and your mouth
too much to comment
I only stick up for myself and yeah
sometimes I try I mean when I see other
people being hurt and people likes you
should stay you know stay on your lane
and keep out of it but if you see a
friend getting knocked down sometimes
you're gonna fuckin time in it no I want
to help people and I want to fucking
just express my thoughts and keep it
gangster online and out people hate that
but it's like oh my god but then you
were like so nice cuz everyone's like oh
I think it's gonna get crazy like
crazier thinking or filming today like
today anyone text you like oh my god be
careful oh yeah oh I'll tell you no I
think we'd even talk about this person
yet count on you yeah okay run oh okay
yeah it'll be a blind item
we got a 20 minute really spill the tea
and I'm sorry I know people want names
just better conscious yeah it really is
like we were saying like negativity or
even like I don't like to talk about it
like you got something as cute but not
like fine came from no yeah no those are
you the restart beheading I've had so
many real friends not that my beauty
friends were all
but like friends of eleven years that
I've never put on camera people on
social media I've never seen because
they don't want to be on camera
right my friend Michael of 11 years was
just here on a last guy we didn't he was
in one picture on the glacier he's like
I wanna be in your videos I don't want
bands back yeah and that's cool he has a
normal life and he doesn't want to go
back home and be harassed or yeah even
like you know people like to inspire or
like you know here's my name touch of
Anadyr oh my god really and you know
yeah and so a lot of people are like oh
my god thank you a fan he wants it to be
a normal life right and I get that I
mean here we have pink cars I wanted a
bitch it's fine I love all the attention
that's what we have seen cars that you
don't care cuz some people would be like
oh coming from my brand my awesome you
don't even like I love it you don't care
you I get it just the same like I love
it what we were just saying oh my god
you guys this is what happens when we
were just saying oh it's crazy I was
sometimes people have perceptions that
people are using you in your life even
though you're not yeah like when me and
Nate sort of dating and he was on my
channel a lot of people just favor baby
wasn't even buggy back he just gives
about your money and I'm like fuckin in
that shit he met me before my brand took
off before YouTube yeah before I was a
millionaire you know I mean it sounds so
weird is that allowed weird was there
before it yes I'm ready look actually I
think you've been writing one for a few
years now really I need to live longer a
little more life no I think that this is
the middle right now we will do books
after like 21 years but people have this
perception of you keeps the key was
there for me emotionally everything
before that and it has helped me go
through experiencing all these crazy
life changes and it's just so cool to
have someone they were actually in love
with go through all these things with
you so it's but it's also shooting when
other people like to all you know try to
alter people's perceptions like we're
talking about drama channels they were
very big last year they're kind of dying
yeah I did all the time I care not I
guess that know what is crazy then they
used me every I didn't love it I'm gonna
tell you like a drama channel it's like
poppin or that even I Ronnie Moore
