channel hi sissy alright so today we are
gonna unveil my entire summer 2018
collection as well as the thirsty palate
but good lord we have to talk about
something real quick before we dive in
because it is June 1st and hello June
how are you happy Pride Month I am so
excited because literally today about
one second ago the Equality mini velour
liquid lipstick rainbow bundle just went
on sale so BAM this is finally out you
guys I am so excited for this because it
is something that has been in the works
for a long time I am so excited about
this because this has an array of shades
of course you guys will get eight shades
all in the minis perfect for traveling
this retails for $52 so for this I
teamed up with the LGBTQ center of Los
Angeles and we are doing a beautiful
amazing thing for charity where a lot of
the proceeds from this will be going to
their charity and their organization
there is more info of course down below
and you can click it and shop right now
we are gonna be filming in a few weeks
dropping off the check from the proceeds
so I am so excited to be a part of this
and I love giving back so if you want to
learn more please go to the description
box now let's dive in to summer oh right
now we all know why you're all here you
want to see the thirsty palette and you
want to see inside so let's jump right
into it now the thirsty palette has 15
shades and bam the unit carton looks
like this now this summer I wanted to do
something a little different now you all
know I have done summer twice now now
let's do a quick recap now 2015
everything was in the yellow cap now
there was no yellow lip scrubs
there was no pilots it was literally
just liquid lipsticks on my brand it was
very young so everything was very yellow
and watermelon soda became such a hit it
is now any permanent collection so what
do we do for 2017 everything was baby
pink chrome and of course we had lip
scrubs we have these we had lip ammo and
it was just a chrome extravaganza but
summer 18 I thought let's switch it up a
little bit let's go really bright again
but in a different hue and less
just mix it up because we all have
different versions of what summer is
this is the jeffree star version let's
dive into the thirsty palate now as I
said this does have 15 shades and the
pan sizes are identical to what you saw
in the blood sugar palette so you guys
are like bitch shut up and open that
damn box right let's open this up
of course the eunuch carton is very
orange and ice cream with water droplets
all over it and the palette does have
water droplets on it as well so to all
the unicorns for this collection so BAM
here is the thirsty palette so let's
open her up say hello to my fourth
palate thirsty oh my god just staring at
it just makes me so I'm like sweating
because I worked so hard on this palette
and I am so excited for you guys to see
it so let's dive in and let's take a
closer look so as you guys see of course
there are 10 matte shades and I'm sure
you're all looking in the middle like
what is that amazingness now this is a
new formula for my brand I like to call
it a more ultra metallic with a little
bit of glitter it's different it's a
hybrid and it's also softer than my
mattes and my previous metallics from
blood sugar and androgyny so I'm sure
you're wondering where is this star logo
in the middle row these are all to dive
in with your fingers with synthetic
brushes and the formula is a little bit
more soft and I never want to compromise
anything for you guys
quality wise so I did not do a star
imprint into the formula because it was
gonna make it a little loose and weird
so they are packed and pressed to
perfection now before we even go over
all the shades filthy-rich is this
beautiful gold one right here and that
is what you are seeing on my lid it is
very blinding and I like to take my
flash like we're all out in the Sun by
the way peeped at new high light
yes bitch coming very soon supreme
frosty alright so let's get back into
thirsty now we're gonna go from top all
the way to the bottom we're gonna do
swatches we're gonna talk about the
colors I also want to note that this
matte formula in the palette is a little
different than blood sugar I tried to
perfect it even more with less fallout
now I know a lot of you were like les
follow I know it's very tricky with
rainbows and
right shades but I tried to perfect it
even more in the lab and give you guys
something where you can really dive in
where it wasn't gonna just coat your
face not the any of my other palettes do
that but I'm always trying to improve
and make everything perfect for you guys
so I'm just gonna say one thing and I've
said it in a million videos I think that
doing swatches with your fingers is
really not great I talked about it in
blood sugar and there was kind of a
mixed feedback in the beginning and then
once everyone started to get their
palates they fully understood a lot of
bright shades when you dig in with your
fingers and of course all of our fingers
have different types of oils on them
different if you wash your hands right
away what is it gonna feel like or how
is it gonna apply I just think that you
don't really apply shadows with your
fingers and less you're doing like a
metallic like this where you can let go
bam and bam everything else you're gonna
use brushes right we're gonna blend to
filth so a lot of the times I don't like
to dig in because remember like a few
shades and blood-sugar you did it with
your finger you swatch it and a lot of
people went huh looks a little chalky
and on a brush it's like BAM and crazy
so same thing here I am gonna do them
with my fingers and just show you guys
how they look now of course all these
shades are super pigmented I'm not
insecure about them but I just want to
know you guys that I think when people
do finger swatches with like really
brights it's always gonna be mixed
feelings but let's dive in so of course
the first shade that you see is called
parch
so we just want to glass of water right
now now parched is a really good color
to just put down on your brow bone on
your lid all over before you do any
shades all right I hate ruining the star
pans but here is shade parch it is very
light very fair but really good for all
over the lid let's move on to shade
tastebuds uh one of my favorites and of
course next to it is bitch now when I
first got this sample back from my lab
that's exactly what I said it was so
first of all let's dive into tastebuds
good morning it is a beautiful baby
coral shade now bitch next to it of
course you have every time you see it
you just gotta say bitch
it is bright I was about to dive in
again but you don't need to so these
three are so cute together it's like a
creamsicle fantasy now when I first got
this lab sample I opened it up and I
literally was like so happy and so
pleased
now these these two are on my eyes right
here the shade next to bitch is called
kumquat which funny story I
besides the sexual innuendo I used to
have a kumquat tree in my backyard
growing up here is what this shade looks
like here I'll just hold them all up
right here I face and then of course the
darker shade next to kumquat is called
stroke and honestly this row you could
create a few looks just with those by
itself let's take my thumb and you can
see they are very matte and very
pigmented now I also want to show you
guys that when you put it next to your
skin these mats are really good and
blending so as I go back and forth with
my finger you see BAM there's no
weirdness there's no chalkiness there's
no streakiness so even with finger
swatches with this neon there is a lot
of pigment just got to put kumquat up
here because oh it's like pumpkin meets
like fantasy I don't even know this Rove
alone is probably one of my favorites
alright so the second row is of course
the new formula that we were just
talking about alright let me clean my
fingers off because I really want to
swatch all of these for you so you can
see how blinding and beautiful they are
alright hands are washed now let's dive
in into the middle row now this of
course as I mentioned is a new formula
I'm gonna go outside and show it to you
in the Sun because sometimes the beauty
lights make things a little like less
blinding when it comes to like
highlighters and glitter type of stuff I
know this is looking really crazy and
great but I do want to eyelid I do want
to show you guys I'm outside as well so
let's get started the first shade is
called
divine one of my favorite word's and
then we have filthy-rich lick Sonata and
plunge so of course let's take our
fingers and let's just let's just do one
little swipe
cuz I know a lot of you are like okay
you want like this a bunch of times with
one little swipe you get full coverage
once you do one or two more girl full
coverage now let's dive into filthy
bridge now today what I did is I as I
took my finger and I literally just went
like this and I pressed it right on my
lid and it gives you full opacity right
away
alright let's
even to lick a gorgeous topaz color
there she is uh hi anyone a Scorpio
topaz is your birthstone bitch now let's
dive in to snatch a more pinky champagne
color see I'm doing too much on my girl
you can see in the pan like you don't
need much with this formula let me just
show you so when you take this you just
take it on your hand and literally BAM
like y'all see ya like hi good morning
yo are you I did a little bit much of
course you can do less you can do it
with a wet synthetic brush you can do
with a dry brush but these are ultra
valign ding high gold look at filthy
rich looks so pretty all right let me do
the silver one could love this one this
is like silver surfer from
Marvel hi oh I mean this is a look with
those three right there baby
let's put lik down oh my god that on the
lid though what's good and then of
course we have plunge oh love the
glitter reflex in this it's stunning
alright now let's quickly go outside and
show you guys how they look alright here
are the five ultra metallics watched and
the beautiful Calabasas sunshine and
they are so reflective and stunning as
you can see a little went a long way and
I am obsessed with how this formula
turned out
all right so let's get into the bottom
row is it my favorite row maybe I just
love bright colors you guys that I think
that it was definitely time to add on to
the color list of shades that I had to
make now I know a lot of you have been
begging and pleading for a yellow hello
the yellow is here and it's on of course
my eye so we have quench right here we
have subtle which is it more medium cool
tone brown and then all the way at the
end we have drizzle which is a really
dark beautiful chocolate brown which is
a lot more warmer than dominatrix in the
androgyny palette so also we have
submerge the hot blue you all saw a
sneak peek down Instagram and now we
have splash a gorgeous matte teal so
let's dive in with our fingers here
no subtle girl perfect in the crease do
not try her she is very ultra matte now
of course quench which is all over here
and in my eye it is gorgeous it's bright
it is not for the faint of heart hello
now a lot of you may be saying hey the
yellow and your finger looks a little
different than right here it's because
I'm mixed and matched a lot of the
shades I was packing on the yellow and
then I was taking let me just show y'all
I was taking taste buds and bitch and I
was kind of mixing and blending them all
together so quench is very bright and it
can be very bright on its own but it
looks gorgeous when he makes a match no
next to it is submerge girl the
brightest blue I could make I mean let's
just rub it on my hand real quick so
submerge is very matte very pigmented
and very blue BAM there she is
let's see how the yellow looks you guys
know I hate finger swatches but here we
go
oh yes yellow alright and then we have
subtle over here I'm just gonna like rub
it in like I'm blending ooh yes honey
alright let's dive into the last two
shades of course we have splash over
here let's dip in my pinky
hello splash and then we have drizzle oh
my favorite Brown I think I've made thus
far and there she is
alright splash looks so good on its own
with the brown shades or even with the
glitters like it is very bright
now of course drizzle over here let's
just rub this in with my thumb hi babe
Oh
pretty now just like I said a long time
ago with the beauty killer palette 2
years is not a long time in my head it
is it feels like 10 years ago
but what I did with that palette is I
covered some of the neon shades because
some people do get a little like oh my
god there's some brights literally you
just cover this right here girl
BAM but of course I love bright shade I
love incorporating that with neutrals
and warm tones and cool tones and I'm
just so excited about this palette so
the final few tidbits about this is that
it will retail for $48 of course the
thirsty pal and the entire summer
collection will be launching June 16th I
don't even think I've said the release
date yeah oh my god alright everything
will be out June 16th of 10 a.m. Pacific
Standard Time that's 1 p.m. Eastern
Standard Time and if you don't know your
time zones you better google it alright
you guys so besides the thirsty palate
there is a lot of accessories there is
actually 8 velour liquid lipsticks 3
velour lip scrubs
so let's get to swatching alright so
obviously well one of the accessories
that is coming with the summer 18
collection is a brand new colorway in
the star handheld mirror we'll call it
creamsicle orange of course just like
the thirsty palette has a beautiful
little popsicle on it yummy
liquid lips first of all I'm wearing one
I'm about to insert some footage of me
finishing swatching this shade this is
one out of 8 velour liquid lips that are
launching of course with the entire
summer collection now the packaging like
I mentioned is all very wet looking with
droplets all over it we have bright
orange packaging with holographic star
logo Hey
and now the first shade I'm wearing
here's all the names you guys don't see
him yet okay so the first shirt I'm
wearing is called soft serve and she
looks like this I love this color it's
pulling a little more peachy on me
because I am very fair and my eye makeup
is very bright but it is a peachy
gorgeous nude alright the next shade is
called coral fixation and it is a
stunning very vibrant of course bright
neon coral I love the shade it was
definitely something that was missing
from my brand and I just wanted
something that was gonna just scream
summer I'm here I mean not for the faint
of heart
all right here is a quarrel fixation so
watched probably one of my favorites and
most vibrant from the collection all
right the next shade number three out of
eight is called a thirst trap
yes ma'am of this shade is a stunning
metallic beige champagne and girl this
one wait you see this red shade that's
about to hit this I've been offering
these two for a minute good lord
but this one by itself is so stunning
now thirst trap is very reflective and
it really like makes a statement so here
it is a swatched and dried all right the
next shade is called a fudge pop and it
is a stunning beautiful warm tone
metallic Brown now I haven't done a
metallic in this type of color yet we
have no tea no shade we have
pussy-whipped we have now thirst trap so
now fudge pop will be in the family and
girl this one is so pretty I've been
wearing this secretly off camera for a
while with very minimal makeup slap on a
bold lip you're ready to roll
all right here is fudge pops so watched
and dried down now when it is really dry
you can take your finger just kind of go
like this and it kind of activates the
glitter to come a little bit more
forward as you can see it is really
reflective oh I love touch pop this next
shade is an ode to my hometown where I
was born this shade is called Huntington
Beach of course that is a city in
California born and raised baby Oh see
now this shade is probably the brightest
and most obnoxious in the collection and
you know me I always got to have some
bright ass in my collection so
let's give her a swatch all right here
is Huntington Beach swatched so in
between swatches I do like to use a
little bit of a lip scrub and I put a
little bit of foundation over my lip so
you guys can see the real full color so
we got three more let's dive into the
next one is this my favorite one I said
that about all of them let's just keep
it real here all right so this shade is
called cherry wet and it is a vibrant
very vibrant red pink hybrid of course
you'll see in a second is the color of
cherry juice honey and I love pairing
this with thirst trap
all right here's cherry wet so washed
and dried down all right two more shades
to go BAM here is the seventh out of the
eight this shade is called yummy and it
is a gorgeous burnt orange with some
glitter in there and some sparkle I love
this shade it is so perfect for summer
for fall for whatever really you
want let's swatch yummy I also forgot to
mention I'm just gonna do a little
insert here that my formula is vegan
cruelty free it's actually I save a lot
of people dip in and use a liner brushes
to do really crazy colorful aligners
lipstick NIC of course has done that a
million times on this channel and just
side note these do be tail for $18 if
you've never bought in one of my
lipsticks before all right let's get
yummy done here all right so yummy is
really special
just like fudge pop take your finger
when it's dry oh look at that sparkle
honey it just kind of activates the
glitter a little bit more in the formula
and voila
now you can take your light of course
and really get the full effect of how
it's gonna look outside but ooh I love
yummy last but not least and I'm really
excited about this one I think a lot of
you are gonna be excited as well so this
next one is called eight one eight eight
one eight with parentheses BAM because
that is the area code of Calabasas and
the valley in Los Angeles now the reason
why I'm really excited about this one is
because it's younger sister seven one
four was such a huge hit now this came
out years ago actually in pink packaging
it was discontinued I brought it back
again December 15 and this is actually
one of my top selling lipsticks of all
time and the formula was just never
there it was always a little streaky and
just because of the way the pigments are
in my formula with the extreme
comfortability with pigment it just
didn't work I still love this shade so
happy and I know all of you live for it
out there but I thought girl I've moved
wearing calabasas now it's time to give
her an older sister so here is eight one
eight and I think this one is top three
favorite shades
all right here is eight one eight
swatched and dry alright you guys so
there was all eight below a liquid
lipsticks so watch and of course the
shade names and the prices of everything
in this collection with the palette will
be down below in the description box now
we got the palette down we got the
lipsticks done let's dive in into the
accessories and now I am really excited
besides this creamsicle star mirror
there are a few more and speaking of
desserts and ice cream
you guys might not be ready for this one
but we have a few new mirrors uh
entering the jeffree star cosmetics
family and swordfight here they are is
anyone hungry because I am we have the
we'll call this the orange ice cream
popsicle Mir and then of course we have
the yummy pop just this is just you guys
know what this is this is literally the
definition of summer in America and I
thought it'd be really fun to change the
shapes on these ones so look at all
those fingerprints yeah so these are
really fun and they're actually big so
you guys can see the difference they may
seem a little slim but look at my big
old horse face hello you can see
everything and I've done my makeup with
these on the road secretly
I've been playing around with different
designs there's a lot of cool stuff also
coming for a holiday I just love mirrors
and thank you guys for loving them as
well
so just like the star mirror both
popsicle mirrors will be retailing for
$20 also for summer I wanted to expand
on the makeup bags because so many of
you bought a lot of these like I cannot
believe the astronomical number of
people that bought makeup bag so thank
you so much for all the love and also
there's videos of people seeing how many
palettes and lipsticks that can fit
inside of the original will call this
the og JSC bag and a lot fits in here
but to me when you're traveling you
might want to put more makeup in so I
thought when making the next design I
know that these like this fit a lot but
when I travel I like to bring a lot of
 so I thought what do you I feel a
little bit bigger so this is introducing
the BAM big ice cream reflective jeffree
star cosmetics
now it does come with stuffing of course
so it keeps the shape this does pull out
if you guys thought this one was big
let's show a little comparison and we'll
do some zoom ins on this you can really
see the material this outside is so
reflective and crazy it's like a mirror
fabric with like hollow and it just came
out stunning so here is the new orange
bag versus the og bag as you can see the
new one is a very big and it is a lot
wider a lot fits in this I was bringing
this in my carry-on so this literally
girl I'm like give me some pallets baby
this fits blood-sugar like it's nothing
it's like a high blood sugar how are you
honey and then you just got to put your
androgyny in there got your beauty
killer which hi to your anniversary was
just a few days ago can not believe that
it fits so much oh you might want to
bring a little 24 karat palette how are
you you might want to bring your Chanel
face mist on the plane I might want to
get your beauty sponges you might want
to do every single liquid lip we
swatched here today like bitch this
is large so if you're someone that likes
a big bag you're definitely gonna love
this one and the orange reflective bag
retails for $28 all right then I also
thought if you're really fun to make a
little travel bags that were bigger than
this and in a different shape if you
wanted to bring foundations and stuff
for under the plane in the car get ready
on your private jet we Roy's Nissan
Sentra that was my first car all right
so I'd like to introduce the brand-new
jeffree star cosmetics travel bag now
bitch she is big now this is the OG one
and as you can see this one is a very
big now I check out the stuffing on this
already but it does keep its shape
pretty nice now this will come in this
gorgeous pink and also a beautiful
orange color so there are two colorways
and I want to show you guys the
detailing on the zippers this has a
little moment look at my nails with the
bag yes honey and then when you unzip it
of course I take out all the stuffing
already but you do have a zipper up here
I love putting lip liners by the way
jeffree star cosmetics lip liners oh
they're coming soon in a few months you
have pouches right under here and
there's a lot of room
there's blood sugar because she's a big
bitch alright so here is blood sugar and
it fits perfectly on the bottom of this
so as you see in here like she is deep
and I love it deep so they both will be
retailing for $30 and of course they
have the beautiful enamel metal on the
front and of course this is faux vegan
leather is really buttery and really
soft it just feels amazing alright so I
really wanted to get this reveal video
up because I know June 16 is around the
corner and I've never had this happen
before but I actually had a production
delay in my velour lip scrubs so I do
not have them in front of me to show you
