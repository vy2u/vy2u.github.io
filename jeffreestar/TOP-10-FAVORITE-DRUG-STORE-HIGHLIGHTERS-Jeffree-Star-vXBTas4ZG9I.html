channel today we're doing something a
little different I'm going to be showing
you guys my top 10 favorite drugstore
highlighters I know a lot of you are
like drugstore yes bitch me and Manny
have been traveling so much this month
we did RuPaul's Drag Con which was such
an astronomical success like I cannot
believe I can i couldnt believe the
turnout when i walked in to the
convention and saw everything i was
blown away so thank you guys so much for
coming to that that was so fucking
surreal
then we jet set it to Las Vegas for the
benefit cosmetics brow launch oh my god
you guys if you didn't see my snapchat
they have so many new skews coming out
it's unreal so I'll be showing you guys
all those in another video so long story
short we've been going to Walgreens and
Target and Rite Aid across America and
we've been slowly picking up all of our
favorite stuff so let's get started I'm
gonna start off with my number one pick
usually people go from ten to one bitch
please I'm going to number one right to
the top right now my first number one
top drugstore highlighter is the
wet-and-wild mega glow highlighters yes
now I showed you guys these a few weeks
ago on snapchat and so many Walgreens
have sold out of these so it's so cool
when I talk about something you guys are
like okay the bitch knows it works I'm
gonna go get it
so these highlighters have finally
started to roll out on every other
drugstore and target but right now
Walgreens is where these can be found
now this shade precious petals oh my god
you guys mmm this is heaven one little
swipe two little swipes it is like myth
it's a mega glow so I'm just gonna
swatch this on the back of my hand and
boom now you guys know I have full
tattoos everywhere so it is kind of hard
for me to swatch stuff but look at that
glow oh I just want to rub it into my
skin the other day when I reviewed that
$70 eyeliner I covered it in my entire
face and I was like whoa so after that
video I've been wearing this non-stop
and my cheeks feel like a lighthouse and
the cool thing about wet and wild
$3.99 are you kidding me and the pan is
pretty big you get a lot of product I've
used this about like what 7
times and like it looks like it's almost
brand new so I went while they loved you
and there's also a darker shade called
crown of my canopy so if you can't find
this one and this one's available you
better just fine I am all honey number
two is that Physicians Formula
highlighter now this one is amazing
now Physicians Formula has been around
for a long time they actually have
several highlighters in the drugstore
and I was like what I don't know which
one to buy so this one is the shimmer
strips I love this packaging hi little
bow love a little compact very cute
you know me I'm all about the packaging
I'm just gonna swatch this with my
middle finger and run it over once or
twice
oh hello pigment this one's really dope
because it has like reflex of like pearl
and light in it I'm just going to put it
next to this one mmm oh come on metal
this one is really really pretty as like
little reflex in it and the reason why I
love this is because it also has like
other little shades in it so when you
swirl it around you're not just getting
like a flat one color dimension you're
getting a lot of pigment in there so
this one is really cool and come on - is
formula
you killed it with this one alright now
this one this is a little unique because
it is not a powder this is a liquid and
this is from L'Oreal and it's from the
Lummi collection if you haven't seen the
foundations with the like sponge in the
middle it is they're really good so I
love this guy this is the liquid glow
illuminator and when when I say glow
bitch it glows so I layered this one
with the wet and wild today I mean come
on you guys what now this one is really
really pigmented I was surprised you
know I know a lot of the times I like to
shit-talk drugstore because then there's
a lot of misses out there but this is
woo so basically what you want to do is
you want to take a little drop and when
I say a little goes a long way bitch I'm
talking like right that's all you need
and what I like to do is I'll take a
Beauty Blender and I will buff it onto
my cheek so I'm just gonna go like this
you guys kind of see it now that is very
light of course you know a Beauty
Blender will you know take some of their
products so if you don't want that and
you want full effing pigment just take
your finger and just go like that mmm it
is so pretty
so the L'Oreal when you guys do not
sleep on this because this one is killer
now the next one is another one from
L'Oreal like come on L'Oreal can you
stop killing it now this shade is called
eternal sunshine um hi one of my
favorite movies looks like Jim Carrey
was so t-girl
and actually took a more feet 5 10 brush
you guys know highlight brush on flake
and I actually dipped into this and I
put it on my nose and a little bit on my
Cupid's bow so my nose is snatched for
the gods today because of this little
guy now this is an eye shadow it's from
the infallible collection but listen as
a highlight we're just going to open
this little guy love that I know that
these will dry out quickly if you leave
them out so use it close it right back
up or it's gonna it's gonna disappear
girl so I literally just went Bam Bam
and I highlighted the whole nose I think
the Cupid's bow is a little missing a
little bit come on keep its bow there we
go oh look at that highlight on the lip
yes lipstick now there are a few other
shades that I found at the store that I
wanted to try this one is called iced
latte it's like a more like cool toned
like champagne e gold and then this one
what is this one called always pearly
pink
yes bitch it is fucking pink I'm gonna
open this one I got to swatch it now
when you have long nails you really
can't uh swatch some things for you
really going to like dip in with a brush
so I'm just gonna take a little flat
brush and get in there but um this one
is so pretty I'm I'm running out of room
you guys I'm just gonna kind of tuck
this on my hand
I know the most ghetto swatch you're
ever gonna see because I am fully
tattooed it is so pretty it's like an
icy pink but it looks like the highlight
version of my hair I know that these are
in every drugstore in America so if you
cannot find them look harder now my next
favorite is from the balm this is that
mary lou manizer now come on if you have
not tried this before you are definitely
missing out nikkietutorials raved about
this and I know that she's used this in
a lot of her videos so I was like okay
if Nikki says it's good I'm gonna try it
I really like this so in Vegas I wore
this the other night I was cheating on
the skin frost I had to you guys there's
just so many highlighters out there I'm
like I'm gonna try every single one so I
dipped into this one I covered my entire
body and soul with it and I really liked
it it was different I also topped it
with some glitter so maybe I was like
really just feeling myself that morning
but this one is really dope now when the
girl rang me up and I saw this I was
like $25 okay drugstore I guess a lot of
drugstore brands are bumping up that
price usually when I think of drugstore
I think of affordable makeup but not
anymore because there was a lot of
brands even old brands like cargo and
vincent longo that used to be in sephora
like 10 years ago they're now in
Walgreens and righted so I actually did
not know that and that surprised me so I
guess this is probably one of the most
expensive drugstore highlighters that
I've seen but if you think this is too
expensive obviously there are a lot of
options in this video but this is a
pretty good one guys now my next pick is
that Maybelline master highlight this is
really pretty
now we open it you know you get a little
compact when you open it it has like a
little woven pattern into the powder I
think that is so cute and it's like
three different shades all mixed
together so of course we've already use
this brush to dab let me plug this
honest hacia I love this brush this one
y'all brush number 23 this is like a.m.
so this guy I just kind of like swirled
it around now this one has a lot of
fallout if you guys can see that it is
really messy so when you're like oh girl
that is a lot of fallout so it is really
pretty though so I think if you you know
just kind of barely dip of course I
wanted to swirl it and see if I could
get a custom color out of there but um
it's pretty very light brush is not
loving this product at all it is very
soft so if you're someone that does not
want a high shine glow on their cheeks
like you guys know I like to look like
the Terminator I think if you don't want
that look this one would suit you a
little more because it is subtle I no
not ever wants to have like a piece of
metal glued to their skin all day
my next favorite highlighter is from
this NYX palette now I saw this in the
drugstore and I was like oh my god this
this is a really cute palette now I know
it's on a single highlighter by itself
but I think this is a good investment
because it has a lot of eyeshadows in it
we have a little contour color and it's
just really pretty now the highlight
color of course is this guy right here
and she's pretty dull when I say she's
pretty she's pretty so I'm just gonna
want to variome oh I love the tone of
this now I know my arms are a hot mess
right now so I'm just gonna put this
over Hannibal's eye right there boom now
you see it is a little more sheer but on
this skin I mean I know swatching an arm
is not the best with a finger of course
using a makeup brush on your cheeks and
your face is gonna show I'll be up a
little to show a little better but this
one's nice like it blends out really
really pretty so yeah that's pretty
shiny though this is more on the warm
side you know if you watched a lot of my
videos I am cool toned and I like to
stick to cool tone highlighters but this
one is really pretty and I love this
palette because you get a cute little
springtime blush you get the contour and
then you get some eyeshadow shades so I
think this Paula is a good investment it
is very affordable for the price and
this one is called the go-to palette
very cute and love the packaging now
this next one is face globe from
galactic I think this unicorn is so cute
literally matches my hair nails today
now this one oh this may have broke now
I did travel with this in my suitcase so
if the powder is finely milled or soft
it could break oh yeah this is messy oh
dear okay well um Thank You LAX Airport
for fucking up my highlighter I'm still
gonna swatch it for you guys I love this
this is shade natural now obviously when
I saw that word I was like hahaha
but um it's really pretty at the
luminous now I'm gonna try to swatch
this for you guys without getting this
all over my urethra now I'm gonna put
this on the far side
oh hi girl AK jig this one is so pretty
it is more of a like skintone color but
it has a little bit of Sheen in it which
I
so again if you are not a high-fashion
crazy highlight fan I think that this
one would you know I think I would suit
like the average bear this one is cool
if you just kind of want to adjust on
the go a lot of the times when I'm going
to the grocery store or the movies all
just wear sunglasses and like concealer
and you know just kind of pop this on my
cheek so this is very cute obviously it
is delicate so be careful with these
highlighters you guys be careful all
right we're getting down to the final
four you now I found this one at the
drugstore this is a Walgreens one this
is a brand called pur that's called
afterglow high so it was kind of hard to
find how I was in the drugstore like not
every brand has some shockingly but this
brand is really cute it's been around
for a minute
lovely kilo silver packaging a very
light weight now this compact high
really good size for the price and I'm
just gonna do a swirl oh come on
pigment now my arm is like glowing
already so I'm just gonna kind of swatch
that right there this one is really
pretty because it has like a yellow
undertone so if you want that kind of
gold luminosity this is a really cute
one now it feels really soft so the
powder the powder is nice you guys it's
nice this just feels like butter I'm
almost like I just want to lick it clean
so good alright let's get down to the
last few this one is the nude wear touch
of glow palette now come on
that little rose gold glow at the top
you better stop it girl this one is so
pretty because you open it and it's like
okay cute you have your little pinky and
aissatou it over here and then you have
the more like I'm not going to say wrong
so that is definitely not but more like
a pale champagne color down there now it
says nude where i swatched the nude and
the glitter to come off so the words
have like an overspray on them which a
lot of products do have that but the
good thing is once you get past the
overspray the product actually still
works let me just show you guys what I
mean by that now you see the wear part
I'm just going to go one to see that
glitter did come off a little bit
obviously it's there so you basically
get like a one-time-use
of that word but then then it gets good
because then you can kind of switch her
this around and here we're gonna plus
watching with a brush so this one has
more like a little that glitters in it
but a little more fine mica
it is definitely really light on my arm
almost looks invisible but on the cheeks
it definitely worked because I tried
this a few weeks ago this one is really
powdery so I know we talked about that
warm nude brick one earlier this one I
would probably recommend over this but
again they both have their pros and cons
so this one's cute for that little you
know natural glow so you wanna use it
with my finger you can definitely see it
better than when I use the brush this
gives you a really pretty luminous glow
so I actually was dipping into this one
the other day and I covered like little
areas of my body like sometimes I loved
to have a shimmery arm obviously I'm
showing you guys swatches all over but
sometimes I love to just have a glow all
over my whole entire body come on
Beyonce let's get into formation all
right so just to throw in a few more
highlighters at the end because you guys
know I am a high lighter junkie now
colour-pop has some really good
highlighters these are under $10 this
one is called stole this show oh my god
I have to swatch this now this one has a
really unique formula it's more of like
a cream to powder so you cannot leave
these open for a long time or they do
dry up so this color oh my god it's like
metallic pearl let me just show you on
my finger uh-huh on I love this one I'm
gonna swatch my wrist real quick boom
this is like high shine glow I love the
color pop formula it is really pretty
and we have a variety of colors for
every skin tone a lot of the drugstore
ones they have got like one to two
shades which is definitely a problem
because there's a whole big world out
there so color pop has a lot of
different shades for everybody which I
think is very important for brands to do
and it's very affordable so even though
this is not in the drugstore it's only
sold online I want to throw this one in
there because it is important and I love
it and last but not least I'm going to
throw in one more highlighter now this
one is all the way from you
this is by silly makeup come on gold
packaging now
Jacqueline Hill swatched this on
snapchat and I was like Jacqueline
growing you got changed my life with
this one now I use this in my last video
and this one oh my god you guys now you
open it up really really cute you get
two powders here and then you get two
creams now the powders I don't even know
like when Jacqueline swatched it on her
cheek I was like I think my phone froze
I just can't so now this one is very
powdery now you feel it and it almost
feels kind of dry which at first I was
like uh-oh want to hit my cheekbones
bitch it was a wrap so I'm just gonna
swatch this here you guys are gonna be
like what the hell I don't matte medium
room let's let's swatch it on the little
bit of room I have in my hand because
this one is a movie oh this might be the
brightest one out of all of them now
this one is affordable as well it's only
sold online of course they ship
worldwide and I love an e-commerce brand
that's killing it so shout out to sleep
your formula is everything that was my
top ten favorite drugstore highlighters
I hope you guys found a few andr that
you are going to try out I know I have
been obsessed with highlighters since I
was like an infant so you guys asked me
to start using more drugstore makeup and
I know you may not see me use these
highlighters everyday in my videos but I
love trying out every single brand now
I'm all about authenticity no one has
ever paid me to promote something I
don't have any promotion with any one so
everything you guys see in these videos
I pay with my own hard-working money
which i think is important to know
because I know some people get paid to
give shoutouts for something that they
may not necessarily believe in mmm I'm
just not the one so I hope you guys
found some good highlighters in this
video that you guys are gonna try out
please tweet me and snap me and let me
know which ones you love because we went
through a lot girl we've been through it
today so as always you guys if you want
give me a thumbs up you know bitch you
don't have to but if you know if you
think this thing is feeling herself
today give me a thumbs up and if you
like his hair give me a double thumbs up
bitch thank you guys so much for
watching and
I will see you on the next video ma bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
