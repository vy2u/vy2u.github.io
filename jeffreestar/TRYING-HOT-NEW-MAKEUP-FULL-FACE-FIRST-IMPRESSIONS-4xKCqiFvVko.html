Seasons and girl yes I'm traveling again
my last video I was in Vegas since that
video I've been in Michigan been working
on my house and just been traveling up a
storm so I told myself girl the jet lag
may be creeping in but we have so much
makeup to play with so I thought I would
just sit down in my room before I did
some meetings later today I'm actually
flying back home the next day so when
this video goes live I'll be in
California for a few more days and then
we are off to Bologna Italy for the
Cosmo Prof makeup convention so yeah I
brought a lot of makeup with me on this
trip we are here doing some stuff I was

someone that's not that interesting we
of course have the unicorn blood version
that
looks like this so we got windbreakers
the mirrors the makeup bags and a whole
lot of goodness coming so saddle up for
March 10th now let's dive into today's
full face video all right so of course
we got to get this skin moisturized and
snatch so I looked in my boxes before I
left here I got a lot of packages before
this trip so I'm like okay let's bring
everything new from the brand glow
recipe we have the new watermelon glow
pink juice moisturizer this retails for
$39 and it says it's really good for
oily to combo skin reading on the here
it says after cleansing and toning
dispense a dime sized amount Pat gently
onto skin until completely absorbed
works well under makeup oh okay but also
has soothing botanicals and it's gonna
prep my skin for the day ahead now I
love this bottle look at how cute this
looks so let's just give her a whirl
oh it's like a um like a wand almost oh
my god it smells like watermelon
starburst
I'm deceased and I'm just gonna take it
with my Beauty Blender and let's see
what happens okay now I have been on
about five airplanes in the last three
weeks so I actually have a pimple for
the first time in a minute you guys
isn't that exciting just kidding
we're gonna cover it fully today
hopefully with some full coverage
foundation this feels alright doesn't
feel very hydrating like I'm not sure
how hydrating it's supposed to feel it
feels alright so let's see how they make
it goes on of course we have a brand new
primer this packaging is turning me on
this is the new tatcha the silk canvas
it looks like a big compact it actually
screws off like this and the there is
the product so this is allegedly a
velvety priming bomb a press silk that
smooths and makes makeup last longer
while keeping the makeup out of the skin
helping to prevent clogged pores and
breakouts yay okay so this is a solution
for pores oiliness dullness and uneven
texture I'm not sure how to apply this I
think common sense says just touch it
okay it's on my hands let's see what
happens here
oh wow go like glides on I thought it
was gonna be like tacky but it's like no
it's gliding so I'm just gonna smooth
this on and let's see what happens
alright that went on really good and it
actually kind of blurred my pores here
they usually are a little more prominent
and they are not alright I'm really
excited for the next product it is a
brand new foundation that just hit the
market a month or two ago I haven't had
the chance to use it yet so I'm really
excited last year is your way cosmetics
was the brand that I collabed with and
we did in this amazing lip topper
actually the only company that I have a
code whip and it's for charity so we'll
dive into that in a second but I've been
dying to try this out this is the G way
essential high coverage cream foundation
it looks like this I have two colors
here with me today I think I'm gonna be
sand shell looks a little too dark for
me this foundation also has a brush that
you can buy with it it looks like this
it is like one of those paddle brushes
but the shape is more unique it has a
little diamond cut right here I'm sure
it's for getting into the crevices of
the face so this is a supreme coverage
lightweight and long wearing foundation
it creates impeccable airbrush matte
finish instantly you only need a small
amount it is a concentrated formula and
it is very full coverage it has
chamomile and cucumber extract
hyaluronic acid oh my god it's matte
it's oil free there's no gluten it's
vegan well hot damn chewy so this does
retail for $38 alright I'm not really
sure the undertones of this I just
grabbed a few I may have myself
over we'll see if this is to yell over
me I am just going to take a little drop
here on the brush itself let's just go
in here do you guys see that that is not
a lot at all let's see what happens
oh that is not my color
alright you guys I put a drop of shell
in here this may be way too much
foundation and this is not my color you
guys can read me to filth but here we
are and remember we are filming in a
hotel
with no beauty lights aah whoa holy Shh
all right so here's the difference of
just a little bit here versus this how
are we feeling it feels like there's
nothing on my skin which is a very
bizarre and why do I feel like the other
color matched me better even though it
looked a little darker all right it's
maybe too much I'm just gonna put a
little on I don't want to get foundation
in my hair so we're just gonna tuck this
back for a second and yes this is a
little dark for me but hey I don't mind
it I'm like first impressions while
we're just sitting here talking look at
that look at the coverage that one drop
is like covering my entire forehead
imagine if we did a second layer you
would be like ready to go swimming and
just be set for life all right you guys
to shade may be a little dark for me
don't mind it but the coverage is
everything I need looking up close the
primer and foundation did go nice
together okay cool you guys so let's
move on I'm really excited for this next
concealer it's so literally six dollars
and it's from the brand a makeup
revolution this is the new conceal and
define full coverage concealer now what
is it supposed to do let me tell you
this concealer you guys literally is
supposed to be full coverage it has 18
shades has cool neutral and warm
undertones it's supposed to be
lightweight yet full coverage it's gonna
cover blemishes even skin tones
counteract dark circles it's supposed to
cover your bad mood if you're in
one all right I mean it's concealer you
guys we know what we're doing here so
I'm just gonna go with the shade see one
it should be the lightest and that's
what I need I love a very bright face so
it could be too bright though you never
know let's just do a little dot whoo I'm
just curious what c3 looks like c2 was a
little too yellow for me so let's just
add it in there for fun
oh it's darker okay c1 it is baby this
is just a full face full coverage moment
today as you guys can see this is
blending out really pretty very
brightening
and blend it out in about five seconds
so I love it I put some concealer a few
more spots over here you guys know I
move a full queen like we want so much
concealer we can't even see our feelings
so now we're just gonna buff and blend
so we added a little bit more under here
it is full coverage but not like full
full like the bottle said or maybe I'm
just a crazy bitch in like dad more so I
did a little second layer under the eyes
and I really loved it it blended up
beautifully it's creamy there's no
creasing it looks stunning and
definitely brightened up my face now
we're just doing the center of the
forehead like lipstick Nick likes to say
this is concealer in the middle here
just kind of creating a little light
burst on your forehead now we got to set
everything and I'm so excited to try
this in Beauty bakery flower it is a
setting powder come on packaging a plus
I love that so this says for a
natural-looking baked beet try our
lightweight matte flower setting powder
great for setting makeup or baking of
course it says use a brush you can
lightly dust your entire face you can
use a makeup sponge you guys know I love
using the sponge so let's open her up
and see what it looks like here is what
the packaging looks like now this brand
is from California shout out to them hey
they're in San Diego and they actually
have a store in the mall which i think
is so cool for any brand already have a
store we're gonna open it up and it
looks like this this is shade
translucent so let's take some of the
powder let's put it on here and by the
way I'm looking in this mirror and I'm
like for a seven dollar concealer this
 is bomb okay let's take our
sponge and we have of course our flower
setting powder in here I'm just gonna
coat my entire Beauty sponge let's see
what happens
all right anywhere where we put
concealer we're gonna put some on there
I'm gonna take a little bit more now
we're just gonna let this sit for a
minute we're gonna take a hit and we'll
be right back all right now we're going
to take a little NARS brush and dust off
I also forgot to mention that this
retails for $24 you can buy it on their
website it is oh it's out of stock girl
you better restock this damn also this
formula is vegan and it is very long
wear so let's take this little brush and
let's wipe
oh my undereyes look like I am 16 again
honey it's impressing me it's hard to
impress this bitch and when I see
something up close like this with
natural daylight and I'm like it looks
this pretty damn bitch I feel like I'm
set and ready to conquer the world just
to set the rest of my face I am going to
use the Beauty bakery flower and some
Chanel powder I didn't have any new face
powder so we're just gonna mix and dust
this all over and then we will start
with contour and highlighting I'm really
excited to try the new Mac Jeremy Scott
this is a little cheek x 3 acoustica
contour blush highlight little palette
now the packaging I'm deceased we pull
it out it looks like this a little
holographic moment it has the iridescent
powder it has a bronzing powder and as a
powder blush let's open it up so as you
see it looks like this and then you pull
it off I love the handwriting like it's
a little mixtape so adorable so once you
take it off the shades are right here
has a little protector and bam it looks
like a little music Soundwave we're
gonna give it a whirl today oh my god is
that they may be a little warm for me
we're still gonna try it you know me I'm
down for anything let's dive in there a
little bit more and let's see how we go
look it's gonna cut my cheekbones out a
little bit okay yeah it's a little warm
but I actually don't mind it it is going
really nice with the under eye so ok
cheekbones how are you now we're gonna
take a little bit and go on the forehead
now this is pigmented I am dusting off
because I don't want to look like a
stripe crazy person but yeah it's a very
pigmented now there is this picture
frame on my wall over here you guys in
the room and I know the lights are crazy
but am i high or is there like this
weird white cat right here I don't know
why because the foundation was
consistent powder everything this side
doesn't look like that
so my lighting is a little crazy you
guys know so sorry about that but so far
so good I was actually worried this
would be really Orange on me but I like
it it's pretty alright you guys now
we're about to dive into the new Breton
rock morphe brushes collaboration this
drops on March 13th
thank you guys for sending to me early I
cannot wait to dive into this
so this has six shades by the way
morphine never has packaging like this
so Brett man you did that girl now when
you open it up you get six shades you of
course get one for every skin tone which
I love it's a very versatile also if you
guys didn't know you can use
highlighters for your eyes for shadows
your body anything I did do two finger
swatches on snapchat the other day I
know most of you saw that so that's
where there's two finger marks in these
two shades now this does it retail for
$29 and yeah this is probably gonna sell
out very quickly it looks stunning when
I did the little finger swatches they
were blinding so now let's see how it
works on my face I think we're gonna use
a baby girl and vacation these two right
here and let's see what happens now the
palette in the pr box came with a brush
so i'm not sure if this comes with the
palette you probably have to buy it
separate let's find out while I'm
opening this so what it says that the
palette comes with this brush so that is
a very good deal for $29 so let's dive
into vacation it looks like a beautiful
champagne gold color does it work were
we about to find out oh okay it's like
that wet highlight look okay very
pretty you know it's crazy about New
York when I go outside and I walk around
no one's really wearing my lighter so
what was watching this from the city
where do we go to see some highlight
action because honey it's not happening
in New York right now I almost want to
add this on top of it baby girl cuz it
just looks so cool let me grab the
morphe 510 brush and we're just gonna
hit that right there and let's just put
that high up here oh wow
are y'all seeing what I'm seeing because
these two together look like magic I'm a
fan of this I had no idea what to expect
but girl this formula is beautiful it's
going on amazing it's bright I'm putting
some of my Cupid's bow I'm gonna add a
little bit of baby girl on my chin just
a little light and
oh wow that keep its both bitches
working alright I want to add a little
bit of color to my cheeks so I brought
the new is your wave the lush little
palette this is the flirt blush duo with
shades kiss me and touch me I haven't
used these yet it was another one of
those things where they were sitting
around and I haven't had the chance so
we are gonna use a little NARS brush
again and I am just going to dive into
this really soft color right here and
then a little BAM let's just kind of
mesh that into the highlight and the
contour and just give me a little blush
I'm so excited to dive through the eyes
my lids are already primed and ready
with the Mac painterly paint-pot now
let's get into some fun shadows I have
been dying to play with these ever since
I saw them on trying to move so Miss Pat
McGrath has new pallets out and she has
three of them now we all know I've tried
and used the other ones oh the formulas
phenomenal so these pallets there are
six shades of course in each with matte
and metallic beautiful formulas I think
we will see if the formula is consistent
to the last palette so there's this one
and this one is called the mothership
subversive the Olevia narrows we have
the mothership subliminal platinum
bronze palette oh wow these colors will
look amazing very different than the
ones we just saw and then there is
another one oh my god the packaging on
this look at that the lips the B in the
mouth I'm done and then this one has
beautiful warm tones full bronze palette
I love that I think that I have
definitely done enough bronze looks on
my channel so the subversive palette is
calling my name now I like this because
you're probably wondering where are the
shade names it does come with this
little moment so you can put it back on
for protection when you're ready to roll
or you can just keep it in your makeup
drawer but I love this and also the
shade names are on the back the shade
purple rain' that's calling my name
right now so I was really inspired by
something on Pat McGrath's Instagram now
they used the palette for this look this
looks so stunning very runway and high
fashion
I'm like okay this is something I don't
normally do I myself so I'm going to
give it a little bit of a Jeffrey twist
but I love the purple and Pink's
together and there's also a new eyeliner
which I have with me by the way hi hello
packaging goals love this holographic
blue there's also a perma precision
liquid eyeliner which I will open up in
a second and we will paint on some
lashes we'll do some liner and we'll see
if the formula for this is good let's
dive into the palette so we're gonna
dive in first to this pink shade we're
in New York City let's go bold and this
shade is called the rose or risque now I
know a lot of your gonna be asking me
what are the price for these palettes
these are 55 dollar retail which i think
is really great because we all know her
other palettes are 125 so if you're
someone that has been on the fence or
you've been dying a trimer formula out
these are good options looking at that
video they have the pink right in the
front of the eye which is so cool and
different so good news is I have no
eyebrows so we're just gonna take this
and we're just gonna apply some pink
oh hello barely touching my skin how
little pigmentation we're just gonna
buff that right or the brow bone would
go and we're just gonna stop it like the
Veda and just give it a little like
burst of pink right here
alright now the model has a very
different eye space than me her lids are
very different so I'm just kind of
tailoring it to what I would do and
bringing the pink up a little more since
I do have no brows I know it's gonna be
look a little weird at first but you
know it all is gonna come together so
now that that pink is lay down this side
we're just gonna mimic it on this side
alright so now I'm going to take purple
rain' and we're just gonna use this
brush to carve out that line that this
model has on her wow this is saturating
the brush who let me to put too much on
it alright so I'm just gonna kind of
follow my line here
they're my deep-set eyes go just to kind
of give the illusion
now the model here had way different eye
shape doesn't mean we can't do it it
just means we have to tailor to our eye
so we're just gonna take this and we are
gonna blend it out a little more i
screenshot it I'm looking alright now
I'm gonna take this little Bobby Brown
blending brush and we're gonna go into
Purple Rain a little bit but we're just
gonna softly take it and just kind of
blend up so I know the line is a little
more harsh on the picture we're gonna do
a little bit of my spin to it and I'm
just going to take that and just drag up
a tiny bit just so there's a little
dimension I am not used to harsh lines
on my face but I'm kind of living so now
there are this I mean there's so many
shades and all of these palettes but
what's really gravitating me is this one
over here called gold nectar now I know
the picture I was inspired from did not
have the gold in it but we're gonna add
some maybe on the entire lid and just
take it there because that's what we're
here for
so I'm gonna take a little flat
synthetic brush and we don't even need
to wet this with Pat McGrath like you
guys know that so I'm just gonna take a
little bit and let's Pat it on the lid
oh wow I'm like good morning so I'm
actually gonna keep a space in between
the purple and just put this gold all
over my lid Wow
usually have to wet a brush to get this
effect but this is like happening
instantly wow I love this gold tone
because it's very unique I don't really
have this color and a lot of my palettes
it's usually just like a bright gold or
like that full yellow gold so I love
this tone all right you guys I'm looking
like a cyborg alien right now this is so
different than what I normally would do
on myself but I'm kind of living so now
we're going to dive into this shade
right here it's called pale fire it's
like a beautiful quarrel here we'll just
touch it real quickly oh wow
this looks in sane look at that
undertone oh honey it's like peach
duochrome pink now I'm just gonna take
some under my eye with a little brush
you can pack this color all over your
lid for a full moment but we're just
gonna do just a little subtlety today
it's gonna take that and lightly drag it
under my eye oh wow so I'm just lightly
putting this right in the front it's
more of a subtle shade so I'm barely
touching my lid if you want more
coverage you can wet your brush or use a
flatter one I just want this to be a
little accent right yes
I'm just looking like a full alien glam
today now I'm just lightly packing this
under my entire under eyes and then
we're gonna move on to the liner I'm
quickly gonna take this shade baby girl
from the Brackman highlighting palette
and we're just going to blend that up
into the pink just so it's full-on alien
and you know it needs to let its full
moment I'm really excited to try out the
new Pat McGrath eyeliner you guys when I
saw this packaging I was like so let's
pop this open in a second after I'm done
blending my life away all right so let's
cut this open and see what this perma
precision liquid liner looks like of
Cole of course of course
I'm cool so nice little scissors to open
this baby up and let's see what is
inside BAM
ooh okay so here is the liner now this
is we're just gonna pop it open right
now
oh wow okay so there's the applicator it
looks something like this very thin and
great and let's just do a little line in
our hand for fun Oh like literally they
went on with perfection look at that
like oh hi okay hello you have to shake
it no we don't even have to shake it oh
my god okay so allegedly this
formulation is sensual its saturated
supposed to glide across the lid with an
obsidian velvet matte finish sigh meeow
this soft flexi art tip offers control
for elegant contours and pristine
definition okay well I cannot wait to
see how this works let's just go in and
let's do a light wing here and let's see
how this works
oh wow this is going on so easy now you
guys know the Tom Ford eyeliner has been
one of my favorites but this is
to give it its run for its money because
first of all I don't even have to shake
this it's just going on with ease and
it's not like skipping and it's not
cheering out at all I hate when you go
to do a wing or a line and then the pen
kind of goes thin this is literally not
doing that I'm kind of shocked okay like
look how easy this is and I'm just gonna
bring this past that purple and wow I
don't know I've ever done a line or a
wing or this quick before thanks Pat I
think I may have found my new favorite
eyeliner or mascara we're gonna use
something overseas that I've never used
before by the brand iconic London and
this is their new boom mascara it
retails for $30 on my god damn that's a
little pricey so let's see what it's all
about here oh wow look at this little
wand that is very unique you can tell
it's a little more smaller than we're
used to seeing on this channel so let's
go in and see what happens
coating them very quick and easy so of
course I had no idea what to expect this
definitely coats the lashes very
thoroughly it didn't make them really
huge and volumizing I think it does the
job if you're gonna wear false lashes it
doesn't really matter anyway because
you're just gonna cover it up but if you
do love to wear mascara by itself this
could be cute I'm not sure but for now
it's definitely coating them they look
cute and no complaints all right let's
do the bottoms real quickly let's see
what happens here now I like that the
wand is a little small
than normal only because the bottoms are
gonna be easier to do oh wow okay it's
definitely working I just don't want it
too clumpy so I'm trying to take some of
the product off of the wand yeah if you
want thick dramatic lashes definitely
this is good this reminds me of the
benefit BADgal the way it applies on the
bottom look out
all right mascara is done not bad you
guys I will say that mascara did the job
our I think the only thing left we need
is a little bit of a lipstick and then
we're done
so I reviewed these on my channel but
they just launched six new shades this
is the CIT London and glitter flip which
took the internet by storm last year
they just released a bunch of new colors
and this one is called undressed if
you've never seen this you gotta go
check out my video or you'll see it
right now but basically this is a hybrid
of a liquid lip that when you go like
this the glitter activates and it kind
of comes to the roof so let's see what
happens here oh wow it's so funny cuz
last time I thought they were definitely
missing a nude for this collection so
I'm glad they made more colors
I'm gonna let this dry and let's see if
the glitter activates alright now that
it's dry and let's see what happens
oh wow now because it is a nude the
glitter maybe a little more sheer on
camera let me know what you guys think
I'm gonna take my flashlight so you can
receive the realty hmm oh that is pretty
when the light hits it girl mm-hmm I'm
gonna Bremen highlight baby alright you
guys I don't have any new setting sprays
I still have my travel little Mario
facial spray with a little chamomile and
lavender and as you can see it's more
than halfway gone whenever when I really
like something I bring it with me and I
use it a lot so let's just give us a
little spray all right well I'm naked so
let me go let my hair down and get
dressed and I will be right back alright
I forgot I definitely wanted to try this
gloss so before we even get our final
thoughts Lancome put out this new glass
called the rosy plum it's basically a
plumping cooling effect lip gloss and I
love a juicy lip so why not try it now
oh the component is cute hmm like a
light creme brulee vanilla II type of
flavor that one on smooth and there was
no color transfer cuz the lipsticks
matte amazing cool we'll see what
happens while we're doing the outro but
okay guys so my bed is a mess there is
makeup everywhere let's go through the
face and see what worked what didn't
work for an hour and a half M let's go
over what flopped and what didn't so the
glow recipe watermelon glow pink juice
moisturizer I didn't think it like blew
me away and my skin doesn't feel that
like Oh so after I used it I'm like okay
it's there did the job maybe I need to
use a little more next time not sure but
this didn't Wow me right off the bat I
will use it in the future and let you
guys know primer wears the primer touch
now here's the deal this worked great
for me my pores were blurred I think the
foundation was so full coverage I
couldn't tell that huge of a difference
but looking at my skin sometimes you
guys let's remember this that when you
mix products sometimes you're not going
get the result you love so if you
combine this this and this is it gonna
give you the same effect if I use lemare
instead of this or you know you guys get
where I'm staying here so when I'm
looking at my face with foundation was
full coverage it covered everything dark
circles hyperpigmentation like all the
little things that you guys tell me I
don't have that I secretly see besides
that my only complaint is that it's
settled in these fine lines that I
really didn't know I had it's a little
right here crazy it's cracking a little
bit and my fine lines are a little bit
more prominent so I don't know what
caused that I will definitely have to
use each product separate in the future
and just on my own spare time to get the
real T but overall foundation coverage
color formula is bomb oh my god the
concealer that was a big moment for me
the concealer and the highlighting
palette those worked right off the bat
like for seven dollars I'm deceased with
this one like it really worked it looked
beautiful and I can't wait to use it
again so if you guys can grab these I
know they're selling out everywhere give
them a whirl the Breton palette of
course this launches soon I love it I
think it's beautiful
PSD from Washington's Bremen
congratulations I'm moving on oh the
little contour moment I was shocked and
scared it was gonna be a little too
orange for me but it pulled off so if
you're someone that wants to go like be
on the go and you're just like all over
the place
highlight bronzer and blush in one this
is for you the blush blush is really
cute and easy I mean I don't really
think I've ever had a bad experience
with blushes on my channel this one is
very soft and airy enjoy wait did that
I'm moving on to the eyes I mean come on
you guys these are everything the
pigmentation is stunning they go on
great packaging is a ten out of ten and
I love everything about the mother ship
palettes like I don't have anything bad
to say about them they're just like oh
hi they work and they do exactly what
they're supposed to do now moving on Oh
another Pat McGrath item is look at the
sea of makeup here is the eye liner and
loved it it was it says it's precision
it worked great so I'm definitely gonna
be keeping this handy it's a very
lightweight and perfect for travel next
is mascara
I like the mascara
I'm trying out a lot lately and it did
the job if you're someone that doesn't
love really dramatic bottom lashes you
may not like this but if you're someone
that doesn't even like falsies and you
just want to do this perfect but besides
that you guys the lipstick was great you
know I love a ciate moment and it's
gloss
it does feel cooling now that I've been
running my mouth but it doesn't like
burn or tingle like other lip plumpers
so like did it plumb besides that what
am I missing I know I'm missing
something there's a lot here this brush
work oh my god duh deciding powder this
was really great it didn't dry out my
under eyes it didn't make me look cakey
I actually really loved the combo of
that concealer in this so we'll be
trying her out definitely a lot more
look at that your highlight though it
