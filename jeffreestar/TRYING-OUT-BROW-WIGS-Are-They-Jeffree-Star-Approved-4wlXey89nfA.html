channel today I have no eyebrows and I
just had a c-section I need help I
really need Jesus and a lot of help okay
so my mom met a c-section because I was
not ready for this world so I just
randomly thought about it today I have
hair in my mouth my hair is wet I just
got back from the beach and I have no
eyebrows and I thought what better time
to try out these crazy things that I've
seen floating all over the Internet
these are brow wigs and they are
basically handmade all real human hair
that someone put on a very clear base
and this is going to give me full
eyebrows instantly I don't have to draw
them on I don't have to paint them on
with a pencil I don't have to do
anything except literally pasties onto
my skin and I will have beautiful
chiseled eyebrows allegedly also I just
want to quickly say I cannot believe
that we are about to be in September we
are literally only less than two weeks
away from the RuPaul's Drag Con it is a
crazy convention that will be in New
York City September 9th and 10th I know
a lot of you out there are going I
cannot wait to meet you all I will have
a huge booth for my brand and I'm also
bringing Manny and Laura so come meet us
and shop us alright you guys so we're
gonna dive into this crazy shit I know
that um I've never done brown wings
before I've never tried something like
this before so if you want to see what
the hell is about to happen then keep on
watching
alright so earlier this year my makeup
artist lipstick Nick did a photo shoot
for the androgyny eyeshadow palette with
me where she turned me into a boy well
we'll just say that very androgynous
creature and she flipped it and really
toned down the makeup and she actually
used something very similar to this but
had hair on it and I had never done
anything like that before and we went to
a place that specializes in like special
effects for movies and stuff and they
weren't the best we had to trim them and
it's like a whole mess when you buy the
brow wigs they are from a company called
a final touch brows and I bought a bunch
they're all have different colors so
there is like a kind of like light
reddish brown there is a blonde and then
there's even guy ones which are thick as
hell look how big that brow is and then
we have
light-brown so I got a bunch of colors
now these are fifty dollars a piece when
I first saw the price tag I was like and
then I read it on their website they are
a hundred percent human hair they're
handmade and they are attached to a skin
like base which is virtually invisible
when adhered to the skin which of course
we're about to find out now the really
cool thing about these is that the
person that made this and who owns this
company created these products
specifically to help give confidence
back to those who have lost their
eyebrows due to illness medical
treatment alopecia stress hormonal
changes or any other reason for hair
loss now we obviously you guys know I
shape my brows been shaving them since
10th grade if you ever want to know just
look way far back of my channel and talk
about it but I've been drawing on my
brows since high school I don't like my
normal brow hair or I didn't back then I
have no idea what they look like now so
besides these being fun and to test out
on me they're actually really beneficial
for people who really do have hair loss
or no brows so it's pretty cool on their
website there is some really cool
before-and-afters I saw if someone that
had like literally nothing like me and
then it's like BAM now fifty dollars I
don't think it's that unreasonable
obviously most of you out there have
eyebrows or you fill them in with
something and you have a little bit of
hair but for those of you that don't I
don't think the price tag is that high
these are reusable they are very high
quality and they are handmade which i
think is cool whoa whoa whoa okay I
misspoke this price point is actually in
Australian money now I order so much
online you guys I forgot that this
company was from Australia because these
did take like a week or so to come here
to my house so calculating this price
tag it would be about $38 plus some
change in American okay so it's actually
less than fifty excuse me my bad this is
in Australian dollars I'm like eh AUD
that is not American now on their
website it says that these are the most
superior false eyebrows on the market
I'm like okay we're gonna see about that
I think I should probably just shut my
mouth and try these on now it does say
that you want to oh my god eyebrows will
adhere to the skin for up to seven days
I'm like girl
have these on for more than a damn hour
I have a flight in the morning okay I'm
scared depending on your skin type
environmental such as oily skin and
humidity they're supposed to last for
seven days so if you live in Florida
they might last a day when we're moving
eyebrows okay well we don't need to
remove them right now
we want to put them on okay so it wants
to apply that the brow to clean dry skin
I literally have to like remove my
foundation right here place eyebrow on
brow line when satisfied with the
position brow should and approximate
line be press firmly down until adhesive
is dry which would be like a minute god
what if you put them on that crooked and
you're like fuck for a week there's
removal okay so there's also products on
the website where if you buy a whole
entire kit one pair brows the remover
the pre cleaner we're gonna call it this
is a little pink solution that you put
on prior which I'm gonna assume is very
heavy on the alcohol base to make sure
your skin is Oh ingredients alcohol
water fragrance fuck me
we're gonna do the pre cleaner then we
are going to this is eyebrow adhesive it
says it says latex free and here's what
it looks like a literally looks like a
top coat for nails
oh that smells really intense okay so
we're going to wipe off my foundation on
my forehead and we're going to stick
these brows on of course I can add
foundation around the brows later it
really doesn't say anything about makeup
like can you put makeup on them I'm
gonna assume no but we can definitely
put our foundation back around it which
is a little scary because I do have
primer and I have a bunch of mess of my
face so I'm just gonna take my finger
you guys with a makeup wipe and let's
wipe some shit off
this is called the new unblended
eyeshadow look coming this fall all
right so the skin is clean and yes this
is a mole or a freckle if you will the
pre cleaner says that caution test patch
before use and we don't have time to
test patch we're going in some redness
may occur but it is only temporary you
guys I'm getting scared oh that a
straight up rubbing alcohol fuck me
okay oh wait what am i concerned about
rubbing alcohol it's not gonna like kill
me so you obviously have to have a clean
slate to put on these brows it can't
adhere to a foundation powder contour
and all of that this looks hilarious
look at even after the makeup wipe the
rubbing alcohol took off even more
makeup okay now we have a real real
clean skin great it says that we now
need to grab the adhesive and we're
gonna pick our brows I think we're gonna
do belong don't you guys think I mean I
am blond why would I do anything else so
let's pop them open and see what the
hell they look like I'm like the other
really thin name do you look real I will
give it that it looks very real already
all right I guess we're going to peel
off one of the sides and see if it works
to make them perfect it says on the site
to like line them up and make you know
you can make little lines just like if
you were to match your real brow and
like do a real moment
anastacio why aren't you here I know
baby so we're just gonna wing it right
now and I'll do the my right first oh my
god this whoa oh there it is whoo okay
so it doesn't feel sticky right now
obviously there's no adhesive so I'm
just gonna take this and I'm just gonna
hold it up to my face okay let's see
what happens
oh my god it like literally looks so
real does that not look like a real
human brow holy shit okay come on come
on I'm sure already I'm like mmm Giggy
all right let me see let's do it up and
this is actually really cool I'm
freaking out okay so we're gonna put
adhesive all over whoa it's sticky it is
it's sticky oh my god this is
so hard you guys I'm freaking out like
do we started ok I see the vision people
hold on no one judge me shit ok I want
it a little more this way so I'm gonna
take it before it's too late because
it's gonna be too late very soon I'm
gonna move it down a little okay that's
probably where I would draw on the brow
like right there
now it says to hold down so we're gonna
press and hold well my camera guy is
laughing hysterically at me don't tell
me this don't look real right now this
shit looks real oh I know I look like
ridiculous trying to put this on okay I
almost want like more closer to my tear
duct but I think it's too late like it's
fucking on my damn skin ok so let's let
that have a moment let's digest it and
let's see how we look where's the mirror
cuz I'm not look like a real brow though
here's here's the only reason why I
think it doesn't look completely real
the edges like I get that they're on a
clear base but I feel like right here
see that I want almost put more adhesive
I think that's only fair I don't know
how we're gonna get this crazy thing
under it I think I'm gonna take a liner
brush you guys and just really take it
there we're gonna saturate the brush and
I think it's only fair to give it a
real-world test and put it under the
thing and press down and see if it goes
away you see that it made it better it
definitely made those edges less visible
I think we really have one down like
woah ok now I will say this now that's
on my face I wish I would have moved it
a little closer in like I think it's
gonna be a little too far apart but hey
for a first try not that bad obviously
we're gonna have to see if I can match
the other side and we can all laugh at
me alright the odds of me getting them
perfectly symmetrical are a little slim
but we're gonna try it anyway
alright let's peel off this baby trying
to get these lined up y'all it's gonna
be a task I know that now I kind of know
don't put so much glue on the end until
you're like fully ready so then you
could at least move it around so you
know we're learning alright so let's see
what the hell is about to happen cuz I'm
very scared
okay I'm not gonna hold them down yet
I'm just gonna look okay this one's a
little lower so let me move it up oh wow
that is crazy okay so here's the thing
I don't know obviously they're handmade
in there's no way they can be I dent a
coal now there's some days we're on a
good day I can draw mine on so
symmetrical but I know that normal human
beings do not have symmetrical eyebrows
so I'm not mad at this one it's
obviously a little thicker here it
starts out smaller how this heads a
little thicker right in the ends I'm not
mad at it at all so let me finish gluing
this down and let's see how she looks so
the brow wigs are glued down my only
issue obviously this is the first
impressions is that this one tapers off
a little more like a little here right
which you could fill in with makeup and
make it more dramatic if you wanted this
side of you look it's more of like a
straight like Star Trek type of vibe
where this one has a little bit more
curve with my skull but overall they
look very real I think I've wanted to
quickly kind of just like put on some
foundation around it to like you know
let it blend trying to find my damn
foundation but I'm just gonna go quickly
clean up around here and let's see how
we do okay I'm like the more that this
is settled in I did foundation you guys
I took like a little foundation brush
and I like painted around the hair very
carefully so the only thing that I had a
little bit of an issue with is right
here on this side I know my eyeshadow is
very close and maybe I didn't wipe off
enough makeup but the glue is a little
tacky there I tried to mask the brow but
overall like if I step back I'm like I
think this side way more in my favor
this sides a little more like the shape
is a little different it's not identical
so it kind of is throwing me off it
almost looks a little like thicker or
the hairs are a little darker so it's
kind of tripping me out if I turn right
here and I'm like fuck around
I like it I really do I'm tripping out
no I think it's only fair that I go walk
around for a few hours and go show
everyone at my office and me and then
I'll be back at you try to remove them
because 7 days that ain't happenin
how are you guys it's been about a few
hours I had some Taco Bell and I just
keep changing my lipsticks for some no
reason at all I need help ok so we are
gonna attempt to remove the brow wig it
has been not seven days I mean this
isn't a cans down for a week obviously I
would never do that so to remove let's
read this carefully here this is the
adhesive remover spray and it says on
here do not apply to broken irritated or
inflamed skin great this is specially
formulated to gently soften and the
adhesive bond and remove any residue on
the skin once the brows have been
removed this can also be used to soak
the brow to ten to fifteen minutes oh so
if you peel it off in a zig residue it
will melt it away which is nice um apply
a small amount on a cotton round and
clean your skin be sure to clean the
skin with an alcohol-based skin toner to
remove any traces of oil all right
no no I'm shaking this it doesn't even
say to shake it let's see what happens I
think we literally it says to like soak
it with the hair alright let's see what
happens we put on this brow first
earlier in the video it's only fair to
remove that one first oh it is oily oh
just take off my eye shadow look at that
BAM
whoa and is it gonna peel huh oh oh
there on there you guys this shit is
crazy oh oh let me try let me try it oh
oh shit there it goes oh oh okay if
anyone is in to peel off porn how is
that for the brow okay so that obviously
came off fairly easy oh yeah it is there
is some sticky ass residue on my damn
skin where is that spray damn my skin is
red under here can you still feel the
glue it's actually all gone okay so that
removal process is a little easier than
I thought
my skin hates me so I'm
gonna wipe off the oil and I'm gonna put
on no other makeup because it's it's
already a mess
alright let's take the other side and
let's remove it that is so crazy okay
for someone that has like had no brows
most of their life that was such a weird
and satisfying experience because it
actually looked really real like when I
went downstairs and I went out into the
real world people were like oh my god
I'm so used to having them drawn on it's
kind of bizarre so do the brow wigs work
they fucking work you guys I will give
it up now I know most of you just wanted
to see me use it and you're probably
never gonna try them because you all
have real hair but I had to give them a
whirl and I'm pleasantly surprised so I
do want to put it on the record I'm a
mess you guys but I will say on the
record that the final touch Brow's are
jeffree star approved I really think
this is such a innovative cool idea and
I will give it up to this brand they
looked real I kind of want to do these
ones one day because they're so big and
bold and I know a lot of you out there
have asked me to even draw on my brows
bigger than I normally do and I'm just
like I'm not a big like thick brow
person I might give you the world
you guys have convinced me all right you
guys thank you so much for watching this
crazy review if you want to sound off in
the comments section down below let me
know your thoughts let a bitch know what
you thought of this look at this looks
like have a sunburn on my face now which
I probably do I need my foundation
alright thank you guys so much for
watching I will see you on the next one
