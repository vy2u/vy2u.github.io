little soft wedding look okay I was
kidding um hi this is Henry and he just
transformed my entire face this is a
special Halloween look for my channel
yay and it's no just Henry on Instagram
just in case things go want to look him
up uh we're gonna put his links down
below with all the products that you
have my face today so I've been wanting
to do this one what we've been wanting
to play makeup for a long time so a
couple years ago I recreated a joker
look on myself so I wanted to do a Joker
look on him which kind of matches old
with new kind of the Heath Ledger grunge
but with the the artistry of the old
Joker so this is really exciting so we
had one Joker orgy on my face yeah so if
you guys want to watch please continue
on if our voices or our faces make you
throw up then you know click onto the
next video alright time to go to Walmart
okay the first thing I'm going to start
off with is a liquid latex I usually
start off with the liquid latex first
because it takes a little bit longer to
dry and I kind of want to see the shape
as it's getting creative when it dry
you'll be able to go on and feather off
the edges so it's a little bit more
seamless but I'm using Ben Isaac with a
text if you're allergic to latex
don't use this bro look like somebody
jacked off with acid on face but when
this dries am I going to be able to
mouth off and talk or no definitely you
won't actually something you want it to
be able to talk okay good like if I was
my mouth would show about some issues so
what I'm doing is I'm starting from his
the end of his lips and don't like the
this middle section you want a little
bit more liquid latex there cuz once it
dries we're going to rip it so we can
get that up
Joker laceration and if you don't if you
don't feather it out enough when you rip
it it'll rip through towards actual skin
is gonna look a stupid smile
oh yeah that's actually that's kind of
 creepy now the reason why I love
this look is because you don't it's
sometimes it will beauties in the the
non structure essence of it like it
doesn't have to be all super perfect in
all these places so you can get a little
bit messy and you can get a little bit
creative and you can add your own twist
so I'm using a full coverage concealer
so for brows what I like to do when I
have more of a challenger brows meaning
their ship a ship shaped off um I will
put concealer and I actually draw the
outline of the brow before I fill it in
because it helps me it's easier for me
to create a bra that way on somebody
with no brows a lot of people think I
cover mine I've been shaving them since
10th grade I have no idea what my real
ones look like which is the fun of
makeup
now now that I shape the brows and you
don't have to worry about the sides and
everything what you do have to make sure
is that this bottom line is exactly how
you want it the top line doesn't matter
because I'm going to feather them in
kind of like a ombre them from down
tough or from lower little top part of
the brow so the base color I'm using is
going to be a brown color and then later
on and then after I'm going to go and
I'm going to put a color into it I just
don't want them to look one dimensional
so I'm going to take a little bit of
mistletoe which is Jesse's new color is
cutting out the holiday and I'm only
going to use a very little bit as you
can see I'm going to wipe off excess I
just want a little kin to that grain
then I'm going to go under
feather up and it's going to be more of
a base color and then we're going to put
a shadow on top of that to give a little
bit more of that debt and as you can see
I'm doing little jagged marks up so that
the bottom is where the structure is and
then the top is a little bit where the
flare is very little very very little
peeking oh yes ma'am okay
Henry's not playing games P well so this
matte green eyeshadow is called seven to
nine from hot makeup professional okay
so pigmented a good brow takes time
people think it's a a two minute thing
on my Krauss take a second it frames
your whole face so now with mistletoe
again I'm going to put a little bit more
product this time on my hand
and then I'm getting a little paint
brush and what I'm going to do with this
is I'm going to add whiskey's on his
toes this is going to make them look
even more rows
so I'm going to use a really light
concealer on his eyes because the white
that I'm going to use everywhere else I
don't want that on his eyes because most
cream colors don't drive down to a matte
or satin finish so it'll eat up your
eyeshadow
so whatever eyeshadow you create use a
concealer at a very light light color
this is w 10 format okay so now for the
shadow it's going to be multi layers of
starting with warm tones taking it down
darker we're going to do a lighter color
on the lid and throw some gloss over
that so the color I'm going to use on
his lid jump jump around from hump
makeup it's a super beautiful like
mermaid mermaid green I like putting it
on with my fingers versus the brush
because it kind of acts on better to
look down and because Shepard has a lot
of lip space really shows a lot so it's
pretty dope the reason I love doing the
eyes first two is especially when you
get this dramatic lip color if there's
any fallout or anything like that you
can always factor
bring in more depth here
and let's look down and then I'm going
to bring more depth here so that those
colors do pop but that it's still edgy
and dark so we're not going to finish
the eye look completely this is the base
of what we're going to do I always like
to get maybe 70% done and then come back
to it at the end and so now the next
thing we're going to go on to is this
latex now it's all dried s we're going
to do is we're going to create the slip
for the mouth for the Joker's mouth so
this is why I told you to put extra this
so that we can go right here and pull it
just enough that we could create a mouth
out of it but that it's not going to
fill up out here on the top part so what
I like to do is I go I go here and I'm
going to pull a little bit back and then
I'm going to just put this in here and
I'm just going to make one slit and then
I can pull when we cut it so once we cut
it you can fold because it's really
sticky when it's at this state you can
fold it into itself so then it starts to
leave more room so it's just not walking
around
you got you want want that twisted
Wendell first litter so next thing I'm
going to do is use the all-white flash
color stick for makeup forever you call
life and then I'm gonna fill in the rest
of the space I'm not gonna I'm gonna
stay away from the ellipse for now I'm
going to let them finish drying up
so this brown that I'm using is another
addition to that texture like I was
talking about so adding this in it's
going to bring less attraction to the
actual liquid latex that's underneath
and so I do layers I do Browns blacks
and a little bit of red the red mixed in
with the brown the black won't be as
vibrant we're going to look a little bit
a little more natural and you want to
make sure you're painting that liquidly
that look that drive latex so Jean is a
peach nest now we're going to add the
red now this red that we're bringing
into here we're going to do two
different birds we're going to do this
red and then we're going to go and
highlight it I mean well I guess darken
it not highlight it with the black this
will bring a lot of dimension into the
foot that's what you want you want the
dimension
so you want to make sure first and
foremost that this line is is being led
into the left so that this looks like
it's one piece that's that's the biggest
point of this is that this is opposed to
look like a mouth so you want to make
sure you're you're you're blending these
lines and you'll see that I put a lot
more dark a lot more of this black right
here because I want I want that idea
that it's just one big lip you know you
can mess around with different different
textures and colors I like to keep the
outside of the lip a little bit more
darker so it blends in more so now I'm
going to use spread word and I'm going
to put I don't want to use the actual
brush so I'm going to put excess product
only and because it's you don't want to
get all the product that we're already
using on brush
so now what I'm doing it's it's really
extremely pigmented I'm gonna put it as
a highlight because everywhere else on
its face I'm going to add more dimension
remember when you use this and then one
it is very safe for the face you want to
Pat it in your firm - to get into the
skin hmm because when you put anything
over a cream if you start to move it
around
it'll get streaky so with this lift
we're almost doing the reverse
contouring where what you would usually
contour with lighter colors or
contouring with darker colors and it's
because you want to give the face some
light even though it's kind of lifeless
but adding these kind of dimensions will
bring so much more depth and contrast to
your overall look where if we just left
it white it would it wouldn't look good
and it would look very amateurish only
amateurs up in dilute so what I like
doing is I like getting stipple sponges
like this and I'm going to get some of
the dark brown and I'm going to go
stiffle so really will bring those
totally different type of ruggedness so
I'm using on the make up forever flash
color palette this palette is amazing
and as you can see I've gone through it
a lot well if you don't own this
as a makeup artist you're missing out
you can literally do anything with it
and because it's jeffree star we're also
going to stipple on some pink yes and it
almost looks a me and cracki and I look
I love that like you bring so much
realistic nice to it so the color that
we used on his brows we're going to give
them a little bit of highlight on that
now hmm
so this is a dark green color and the
reason we're doing that is because when
we throw the best Lane on it or the
all-over gloss when we put it on so it's
Mac it's discontinued so sorry you're
gonna use a substitute we had to pull
this out of our Mac archives this is
from the bulk literally like we're
talking eight years ago I know
even though makeup does have an
expiration date some products will be
honestly be good forever
I used to work at Mac ten years ago and
I still have lipsticks that are honestly
brand new so the reason I'm using this
is because it has like a prole defect
I'm not only do we get the whole color
color underneath but we also get that
dope on top the lashes I'm going to use
our new I just drove a learned who they
were and I love this brand so I'm going
to use four lashes in Russian below
that's it every good lipstick name so
this is the final look we still on the
lashes I do want gloss all the way
around here
I brought the the latex of the lip up
more through a little bit of darkness so
you can have some contrast so if you see
I threw that same lid color on the lip
and kind of splotches everything around
remember the key of this look isn't
perfection the key of this look is the
grunge and the contrast of colors except
brows you want perfect brows at all time
but that this is the final look Jeffrey
did his hair up kind of grunged it up
for you to give that roll Heath Ledger
feel and that awesome jacket in is
pretty life love it so cool
thank you thank you I'm so excited
bye guys thanks for watching ma
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
