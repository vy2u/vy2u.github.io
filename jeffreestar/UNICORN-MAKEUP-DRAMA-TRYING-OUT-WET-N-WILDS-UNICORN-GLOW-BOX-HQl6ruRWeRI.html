channel now today we're going to be
diving into the new wet and wild
unicorn glow box and today we have a
whole little yummy box to try out now
there's a lot of stuff in here which
we're going to be talking about in a
second but I know recently there has
been so much drama about unicorn
inspired makeup and here's the thing
waffle makeup has had trends come and go
throughout the years everything from you
know only people wanting nude lips to
now this crazy a holographic trend
- now unicorn inspired makeup brushes
highlighters lipsticks lip glosses
I mean look so many brands have done it
now and I know there was some drama a
few weeks ago if you won't even hear
about all that I'm going to spare you
guys because this is my channel and
we're going to just keep it moving but I
do want to reference that hey look at
the end of the day makeup is makeup and
if 20 brands want to come out with
brushes of the unicorn horn handles it's
a trend I mean people want it customers
want it and if you can't afford a
high-end collection you maybe you'll be
able to afford the drugstore collection
so I think it's cool that so many people
are diving into the unicorn realm and at
the end of the day let's rewind all the
way to the 90s to Lisa Frank anyone want
to do a quick Google search on her
because she was the queen of unicorn and
pop art and anything kitschy and fun
like that
so now wet-and-wild has put out this
amazing unicorn glow box and I have
something exciting to tell you that I
just find out myself starting May 21st
wet and wild the whole entire brand will
be available on all set calm I don't
know if it's going to be in stores I am
praying but it will be available on the
website and I think that that's so cool
- Ulta is just like eating everyone up
they know they just got coverfx and now
they got run well so now before we dive
into this first impressions I do want to
say that for the second time I am doing

this beautiful box which will be for

the big box so you get three rainbow
highlighter there is a bronze one and
then of course there is a unicorn blue
rainbow highlighter which you know I
tested one of those which is originally
created by bitter laced Beauty shout out
to them I live for that brand and it's
so cool that they have inspired so many
and then we have next the everlasting
blow which looks like more of a lighter
I guess kind of skin toned let's have a
highlighter there it's like silver and
like white in there so we're going to
swatch them all today we're going to
play with it and also comes with this
brush the unicorn glow highlighting
brush now I know if so many people have
done in these brushes now we will see if
this one is amazing or not so there are
two lipsticks they are immortal tears
that's cute
so this is an iridescent lip color I
think it's supposed to like transform on
your mouth like it looks like a certain
color you put it on it changes which I
love those mood type of lipsticks is
what I like to call them and then we
have three color icon loose pigments
which of course are for I highlight a
body really whatever you want them to be
for and they look like this hmm now I'm
wearing blush only and it has a
highlighter I guess embedded into it
which I mean I guess I kind of knew that
when I put it on right it was going to
be that blinding if by a Natasha de
Nonna
it's the duo glow yeah I probably should
have read the word glow so I do have a
little bit of a glow to my face try to
remember that and then we're going to
try new songs off of that alright first
I want to unbox the highlighting brush
with a little hollow packaging
holographic is like holographic anything
is just like I don't know it's just
cool and it's very trendy right now here
is what the brush looks like this is of
course it says a highlighting brush for
precise application ultra soft bristles
for easy blending okay let me feel it
just so soft very soft cute okay now
let's try the three highlighters first
I'm just going to go for the lightest
one this is called everlasting glow we
will try this one first I do want to
take my clean finger and I'm going to
run through the whole entire thing okay
so it looks something like that now I've
tried rainbow highlighters before my
channel usually I'll take like a flat
brush and see if I can get the unicorn
or unicorns have the rainbow effects on
my cheekbones and then you can also
swirl it around and it creates its own
custom color I'm going to take this
little narns Ida brush and we're just
going to go back and forth a few times
so there is the color and let's see what
happens oh oh wow
we sure like yellow kind of pinky tone
now I didn't go completely rainbow on my
cheek but I think I can tell you this
that as a pigment let me just go right
over that I know it's annoying that
there is pigment I'm just going to go
with my fingers one more time and I'm
going to show you guys a little so watch
right there it is a very pale so here
someone has like a medium to dark skin
tone this one is not going to work out
for you but let's try the bronze one
next and that this one is called bronze
over the rainbow okay that's the cute
shade name now same thing it has a the
kind of like rainbow effect in the pan I
spent some times when you fingers watch
things the oils in your finger can kind
of like fuck up the pigment so let me
just watch this with a brush first okay
so let me just go in with a clean brush
and oh my lord that is what that looks
like let me go on this side of my face
and see what happens
alright so to me it still is kind of
pale like the other one so if you are
someone that is a little more like olive
toned or even like medium to dark skin
tone I don't know if this highlighter is
going to work for you because it is
pretty tail and when you see has a lot
of bling to it which I love I'm actually
going to take
right here on the brush I'm just gonna
go like this and see what happens
oh I'm gonna come on Pigman
okay now the rainbow one I've actually
already tried this I've never tried on
my channel though this is of course
their unicorn glow highlighter let's
open this bad boy up and it looks
something like this we've all seen
rainbow highlighters by now they were
such a big hit last year and they're not
going anywhere I don't think so let me
just take a I'm gonna take my finger for
this one it's gonna go up and oh wow
come on rainbow and let me just do a
little swatch right there and I see that
when I was like that teal effect
definitely it's still on the light side
and it does have like an iridescent like
light blue I mean I never swatch this
with my finger let me do it now that I'm
done and there is that one you can see
it does have more of a golden tone but
it is still very on the pale side to me
I think
remember out the pressure came with that
I forgot to use it's right here and if
we are going to oh wow see a white brush
definitely shows way more than something
that already has like a dark color to it
so I think it definitely oh look at that
holy shit where am I gonna put this
bitch in yeah I might even layer it on
top and just do what happens I'm like
why do I want to color my grandma with
highlighter though hey girl oh now I'm
gonna take this and I'm gonna put it
over here just in the center oh my god
it looks so much highlighter on okay
that is really pretty it is more on a
little powdery side okay so the
highlighters are pretty good if you're
someone that loves a fun glow these are
definitely going to be something you
will want to try out and they're very
affordable which I love went wild for
alright let's try these unicorn
lipsticks all right now wet and wild
just put out these brand-new mega left
your distant lip colors it says that
they will radiate all things unicorn
with this lip color that will leave you
with a prismatic rainbow effect that
could never be seen as too much alright
so I wiped off my lip gloss that I was
wearing and then we are back to normal
mouth I guess that's a try them out so
this one is called unicorn soul and it
looks like this oh wow it's like blue
now I heard that these change colors
when you put them all
on maybe like a lip balm and I like a
lip tint I'm not sure but let's find out
uh-huh okay all right you guys so I'm
gonna give you my first toss around the
bat as usual it doesn't really have to
smell what you know I don't mind almost
like nothing it's not bad at all now the
pigment on this for a drugstore brand I
thought was really cute it definitely
has that like iridescent aspect I
thought it was maybe like one of those
transformers where I was like green and
then it comes off pink but this one has
like a really pretty like duochrome
upset when you see in the light as I'm
moving it gives it kind of like a
shimmer my lips definitely have a pink
undertone under and then it has that
beautiful I mean that you're destined is
the right word effect to it Wow imagine
this like over a black lipstick or over
something else a veil extending but by
itself I'm not mad at it I will say this
so when I was applying it over and over
it got a little streaky like it didn't
want to like move around once it was on
if you can see right there so I would
definitely probably put a lip primer
under my lips just so it like really
stayed but if you go back and forth a
few times it does end up looking really
pretty so let's try the other one
now this shade is called immortals tears
and it looks something like this oh wow
that is a very pale I would have how
it's going to look on me mouth oh my god
okay so I didn't turn the lipstick
earlier but look what is embedded in the
powder you guys can look on the zoom
it's a little unicorn head that is so
adorable I find out all right let me put
her back in her cage all right let's
give this color a whirl oh come on
fucking I mean this is like very jewel
calm hmm okay this one definitely went
on now that the other one was like
streaky but it went on a little less
streaky as I was like maneuvering it
over and over it almost was like a lip
balm it feels very like soft I guess is
the right word isn't so heavy does it
feel weird same thing really no
fragrance I like them this one likes I
think a little bit more and I like his
pinky under trohman under my mouth and I
of course wiped it off so there was no
foundation on my list I want it to just
like adhere to my natural lip color and
I really like this one I think a little
bit
guys the two lipstick colors were very
impressive for a drugstore I'm like okay
you guys I see what's going on here now
I think it's time to swatch this pigment
all right so these are the color icon
loose pigments and this is in shade
Pegasus letter I love that name just
going to put it out there those really
adorable and almost looks like an icy
lavender color so let's open her up
oh wow as like almost like a little salt
shaker thing that you have to snap up oh
my god whose nail you guys imagine if I
broke a nail in my channel okay oh it
opened up really easy actually thank God
sometimes just like peel back plastic
it's so extra oh my god this is really
cute so I'm gonna pour a little bit out
I'm even my ham oh wow the loop comes
out like so let me just move it with my
fingers you guys can see the color ooh
okay now it is very light I will say
this I think I was expecting it to have
maybe a little bit more coverage it's
obviously there but I thought it was
gonna be like the lining but it's cute
doesn't like a shift to it yeah can i
really impress with this but it's
definitely cute we can definitely layer
over something but I'm not in love let
me try this blue one this one is called
a unicorn wishes and it looks to be like
a dark dish maybe color okay let's put
the blue on my hand has like little
pretty like flecks of gold in there if
you guys can see that on the zoom in is
pretty alright let's take a clean finger
and let's blend her in to the skin oh
wow this one is way more pigmented than
the other one and it has once you blend
it out look at the gold in that blue
holy shit
girl I'm like what happened to this one
maybe this opposed to good more of a
soft iridescent but when the other one
is this blinding you wonder what the
fuck happened of the other one oh my god
that blue girl I'm definitely impressed
with that one alright let's move on to
the third one and that one is called
mythical dreams it looks to be like a
hot violent purple type of color which
purples are hard to make you guys in the
eye shadow realm girl I don't know why
but purple eyeshadows are either very
amazing or not it at all let's try this
out shake a little on okay there is that
I'm going to take what's close look what
finger is clean we'll do the ring finger
and we'll just massage this into
Oh oh my lord that is really pretty
I'm just going to add a little bit more
oh my god okay these two are it so I
really love mystical dreams and I love
Unicorn wishes the other one really
still flat for me like the more cereth
used to my girl was it supposed to be
like I don't know highlighter body
highlight and me honestly not I don't
know but clearly one was kind of a dud
for me and the other two are beautiful I
cannot wait to use these in upcoming
tutorials okay you guys we have swatched
the entire unicorn global collection let
me give you my final thoughts alright
you guys so we have tired of the entire
collection now I will say this about the
rainbow highlighter I'm not the biggest
fan of them I like just regular
highlighters where you can just dip in
and go have to swirl it around and get a
custom color you guys know I'm such a
huge fans of the Wet n Wild mega glow
highlighter this one is one of my
all-time favorites that I've ever put
out I was obsessed with them I mean
there are something fun to try out and
of course wet and wild is very
affordable so I would try them all but
in my opinion the mega glow ones are
just a little bit better now moving on
to the iridescent lipsticks I was
shocked I mean this one is been on my
mouth for 20 minutes now hasn't straight
it hasn't moved I've been drinking some
CodeRed and it stayed that's nice it's
really really pretty I think for the
price point these are amazing and if
you're someone that doesn't want to have
a matte lip on all the time or something
really bold to me this is involved it's
really cute and summery and you can just
throw this on even if you have like
sunglasses on and you know some
concealer this is probably one of my
favorite things from the collection now
of course we just tried the loose
pigments and you already know my
thoughts these two shades are stunning
unreal pretty beautiful and I can't wait
to play with them now on the other hand
this one I don't know what happened girl
I do not know what happened but maybe
you can put it in your inner corner or
sweep it on your vagina I have no idea
but this one was not for me
but the other two were beautiful so I
this entire collection in the box is
very affordable and amazing I'm looking
on line and the box is only $29.99 and
you get everything that I tried on today
so I think an amazing deal now if you
want the unicorn brush separate that is
only $4.99 on my girl if you're going
just by the garage - about the whole
damn thing but if you only like the
brush of course that is available by
itself and yeah
come on wet and while you fucking show
you to the court today there was a few
kind of misses but overall is a really
cool collection I had a lot of fun
trying this out and I'm just going to
put it out there right now the wet and
wild unicorn lo box is Jeffrey thyroids
