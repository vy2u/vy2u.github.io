channel
oh hi hi I brought my girl Nikita dragon
back and we're going to dive into some
fun today we have a first impressions on
the brand new Urban Decay vice liquid
lipstick oh yeah no no we're like oh
really now me Nikita both are obsessed
Urban Decay love their brand when you
first start wearing them I didn't start
wearing them at first because I was just
a gay boy at the time in my college or
high school and during the prom makeup
with the nikah Tala in high school I
started that's when I was and I think
eleventh and twelfth grade I discovered
urban decay in Sephora yeah and you know
what's crazy is that they just
re-released some of their old lipsticks
and their old bullets right and those
are the lipsticks I first bought growing
up and there was a shade called asphyxia
and it was like this purple blue indigo
and I was like that is a badass name
that's the sickest color no one really
had blue lipsticks back then so I put it
on for the first time and I was like um
sounds like invincible like I walked
into the high school like random bitch
what so it's crazy it's like been how
long have I got a school of 12 years now
oh my god good hahaha
and it's crazy that they are so massive
and it's so great that over the years
it's just been like such a big success
and last year I had the opportunity to
fly in New York and hang out with urban
decay for one of their launches and the
owner Wendy was so incredible and she is
so intelligent and just immersed in the
beauty world like she knows everything
is like a dictionary of like a beauty
tab you guys know that I reviewed so
many liquid lipsticks on my channel
every brand from drugstore to very
high-end and I'm excited to test these
out I can't wait now here's the thing
Tommy now there's 30 shades oh wait
first of all I could never do that many
on my own my babies that I was called I
went cokes with pizza oh hi so I find
the kid over to help me swatch these
we're probably going to do like six or
eight each because 30 there's no way oh
my gosh is all out if you guys want to
see us watch all the colors and learn
about the price more about the product
to keep on watching
are you ready girl I think so alright so
let's look at the packaging first of all
unless we're about to be judged Duty up
in here what do you think about it I
love it
very colorful yeah it's very bright I
think it's cute and it feels nice come
on in boss so it has eight lipstick
shades on the front which I'm sure are
in the line and now let's pick it up is
it yes that's cool so has a sticker and
there's Q formulas so there is a
metallic and is also a normal man oh now
look at this claim on the box
these are allegedly waterproof long
lasting liquid lips let's pop it open
and see what those look like
okay so first impressions on the
packaging and the wand everything go up
umm it's quoted like this one's a little
bit smaller like normally like the
actual where the lipstick is it's a lot
longer with a smaller cap now in the
past I have definitely complained about
other brands having short like wands and
like it's hardly as long fingers or
maybe a normal-sized hand and you're
trying to do it and it's like tiny that
was it Northern aligning so the handle
is very long now the Dhokla is
interesting as sort of a tellement it
kind of tilts like my ex in 9th grade
and let's see so this is like a plastic
metal it feels lightweight very much I
wasn't I would want to be a little more
detail I like it heavy yeah so it is
plastic is not like a metal where's it
smell like cotton I'm not viable and I'm
not yeah there's no like vanilla there's
no like fruit flavor no sweet and it
doesn't smell crazy chemically either
and now the straight name of course is
on the bottom has all the information
the package came with a little breakdown
of what it's supposed to be so it says
like their original lipstick formula
vise liquid lip lays down intensely
pigmented color and the comfortable
non-drying wear sets it apart from other
liquid lips oh wow that's the boys off
okay room so 30 shades is a lot Brenda
launched which is cool obviously Urban
Decay is a giant they are the cues for
everywhere now so I think what we're
going to do is just take probably just
some of our favorite colors that we are
seeing some of the names are very
enticing about
yeah okay all right so these pretty
little t grow mouths are about to get to
work so let's get to swatching all right
where do you think I got mad but it has
it glitters and Stephanie okay look I
made a DMA just one day one day bitch
okay and I have twitch all right we're
both taking kind of the purple family
Cheers
hardball all right let's see what
happened how you doing over there girl
I'm trying
this week you this is trying to be I
just thought it'd feel a lot like
thicker okay it's applying it like any
regular liquid yeah creamy yeah like
this one in colors doesn't look as great
as I thought I'm trying to be got bills
at home okay hello this one has great
coverage this is a matte though she has
the metallic one on well you do a second
layer yawn trying it's like this
person's still weird
oh it but it was really painted an
option just fucking through a lot you
guys a big right here shit okay alright
so I'm wearing the full matte and what
do you think about my dress
I don't mind I mean it looks completed
I'm not sure how many things got to go
in it it was yeah hey I jumped four
times which is not that bad
for some reason I thought they were
going to be like so pick my pain yeah
and I know my list segments and now it
just took like a few more times to go
over instead of like just one swipe
coverage yeah I do not have that with my
job
the or difficulties attendant Alec what
you think about it I don't know I just
really really trying to like dip in
there and try to really work at it and
it was super thin almost like a gloss
out of way that's all about that English
of all of a sudden through like pigment
at me and then it was trying really fast
and I try to move it around but I
honestly had a really really tough texts
yeah it looks right now it really
streaky
and it's the glitter looks like gritty
how does it it feels it really sticky
right now okay I want to say this the
matte one not sticky so might like not
at all no mine is like I'm like China or
not is it kind of gritty or no yeah
my move pretty pretty okay well let's
try some more in the different in a
different color family and uh I'll take
this one up okay the claim of being
lifeproof I kind of think that's really
accurate very I don't want to come off
y'all not doing so many swatch videos
usually I put a lot for when living has
been watching hunger over here just work
at this for five minutes
am I wrong amar Oh God
the edges do not want to come off I
might just have to keep going so at
least those clay are and they won't they
were not bald
let's grab another you tried Matt and
I'll try metal yeah oh yeah oh my god
look at the glitter and am I really
ready woo mine kinda has like an
iridescent to it like bleep oh okay
magenta the nopales that looks like that
right okay what's it was your whole
Firebird Oh Firebird okay cool alright
let's try big vein
I see what you mean about like a day
apply like kind of inconsistent mm-hmm
okay no just like Tom Potter my top lip
now yeah it wasn't be super thing and
then go super thick it's like huh what
do you want to do I know I don't know if
I'm doing something wrong but you guys I
really don't have foundation on my list
or anything nothing literally nothing I
love the glitter aspect like when I'm
back here right when I'm Way back here
when I'm looking on the monitor I think
it looks pretty close up it's like true
chunky for me yeah it's like watching
the covariance yeah it's like splotchy
the glitter almost like sits on top um
all right I was really hoping this pink
one was going to like blow my mind away
like when I first started applying it it
was getting there and then it kind of
fell flat yeah
all right let's try another one so I'm
going to try and Heather metallic
because I'm a little shocked at that
barbie one when Blake deserve a second
chance
yes okay so this one is called flame no
they don't ever and this predicts good
okay what's your cold back hop back cock
bitch all right back rows oh my god all
right let's let's fucking try this out
I really don't like this one I'm upset
but things aren't working out for me I
see what the direction they're going and
I think I'd be so happy like I'm just
like please I'm rooting for you like I'm
really rooting for ya I'm so yeah y'all
know I'm such a you're Urban Decay's fan
but this is not acceptable it's so sheer
and like blotchy and like for some
reason this one in particular feels like
really like err it was just so sure yeah
I don't know it looks so pretty in the
bottle I don't maybe it's the micro with
the glitter they use I'm not really sure
what's going on right now but I'm a
little like what but I can't get over it
let's talk about yours oh that was grass
I actually when they looked is really
worth this one I noticed I think it
might be the doe doe foot yeah this I
like really have to like get in there
and work it cuz I feel like it almost
cleans the pot too much oh that is
really able to like be super generous
because now I know how to work around
this plan okay alright let's try a
different color family they got some
dark stuff in here we have already got
pink this off its raw they are really
hard to get off which means on a bigger
thing if you want to keep your lipstick
on all day alright so I'm going to try
this hot red called crimson where you go
dry studded which is like maybe like a
greenish olive with gold flecks it says
it's a metallic gray Brown I tried okay
alright let's try this out
all right how you deal um I feel a
little bit better about this metal but
still it is so chunky like I don't know
what it what that consistency means in a
let's say excited let's just say chunky
I think it's the glitter and maybe like
the ingredients that are making it
long-lasting and the glitter maybe
aren't meshing I mean I don't know
obviously we're not chemists now this
one is really pretty but you see no like
a little bit here it took a little
difficult it's not as darkness that come
yeah I see yeah like this is the most
full opaque one I think that we've tried
so far but I'm still I like I like the
color you know I mean I love a cold tone
red looks really a really dark shade and
I think I don't know my mouth is like
I'm dying Jesus alright we're going to
take this one off or attempt to and hope
you're right back alright so we're going
to try a really dark shade and I think I
mean my mom hates me
my mouth is not I know I cannot watch
ten more I will fall off of this chair
so we're going to do a final one I think
we've tried a different colored view
each time and between the metallic and a
comfort man we tried a lot so this one
is called blackmail oh and you're just
called disturb how didn't read that
myself specific techniques agree all
right my mouth is like holy hell jesus
take the wheel
alright let's do it
girl I don't know I've never had this
much of a problem can I say with a
lipstick or maybe I've always played it
safe but I've never had one of those
moments like oh this is so bad I can
that's like three nothing like that but
this is bad now I always say in my
reviews that darker shades are harder to
me with liquid lids and like I don't
know what it is but this one is so
stretchy and catchy I'm like girl oh my
god I was trying it's getting so much
worse when it's dry and when I want to
cry right mine's a lost cause all right
I think it's time to give our final
thoughts and see if this is a Geoffrey
Star approved I'm a little like shocked
right now meet him like I love Urban
Decay so much and you guys know my
reviews are just always 100 percent
honest I don't give a fuck who or what
it is now I just got to put it out there
now that I'm trying to justify myself
look keep that really really clear right
now I am obsessed with Urban Decay's
brand you guys know I'm not a shady
bitch I just always am honest and this
formula was really lackluster for me
yeah and I knew it spoke for itself the
metal ones and I were I think worse than
the matte mm-hmm the glitter just was
not amazing it was like kind of crumbly
and ready and like you said it was
really trying to be long-lasting but I
think it might have taken away from the
glittery agree do take away some
long-lasting and add and maybe I don't
know but this Jonathan is so like
depressing for me yeah I like one of
crises I really wanted to love it and I
was so excited to try these out and it
was definitely felt really really flat
for me so obviously if you guys have
been watching this entire video you
might have a small inkling of what I'm
about to say but Nikita these are not
just that are approved oddly are they in
Aikido no no no no no I'm like so upset
about I'm like fucking pissed I don't
love these well I really like the
packaging that yeah Rumaki are the holes
and all the media and great things I
love the color story of the entire
launch I think that was awesome
I love the design of this but it ain't
mean the shit names are kind of Awesome
I mean over decay always those six
shading but the formula you guys was not
it for me so I definitely need to go
grab some lip scrub and maybe take a
moment oppression take a bath but on my
face something spiritual needs to happen
right now
