something new I got in from Japan okay
it's uh I love the things you buy from
Japan usually so we'll be good this is a
new skincare device that just hit the
market for some reason it's not
available in America who knows what the
hell that means but um here let me pull
this out from under here and voila
FIFA Panasonic it's a and we all know
Panasonic they make amazing toothbrushes
here in America and I sure do
I found this crazy gym on Amazon and
basically what this is gonna do today is
some shirt wondering why I'm wearing
full makeup yeah this is gonna suck out
all the dirt from your pores and I think
blackheads all right I'm down no I got I
got a gonna farm here now Nathan has
like combination skin very oily in the
morning and at night so we've been
trying to get his skin in order but he's
a male in his mid-20s his skin
it's like hit or miss it has its ups and
downs it definitely does he has a few
pimples right now which he did a
about using he's a dude we all I'm like
oh hey longer minutes ago it was Taylor
he don't give a so I've never used
this before obviously it's still about
packaging I was gonna see if you would
be down I'm down I have so much you got
a lot going on yeah all right well I
would read the instructions but it's in
Japanese and I only speak English and
dignities oh so basically we're just
gonna pop this open and I think it's
kind of self-explanatory the girl is
like smiling she's pointing at her nose
like okay and then she's BAM right now I
obviously we have no idea how this feels
I'm just gonna take some little scissors
here and pop this open pop it open Bruce
Lee oh you got it yeah so it feels a
lightweight okay it definitely owe me
that's like clean it okay
oh wow okay so this needs a triple-a
battery so I'm gonna assume you just pop
this open thank you I'm gonna go grab a
battery yeah Ben okay all right we got a
double-a battery I'm just gonna pop it
into there lalala and I think you just
snap it back on and there go it's
screwed on tight so does it work
oh she works she works
sounds like a vibrator at in high school
all right so I guess we're just gonna
we're gonna zoom in on Nathan's oily
nose no given no I've given clean
her face in ours so yeah no I don't
think I have it but he just got out of
the shower which is good because for if
you don't know this for anyone out there
it's nice to get your pores really like
warm from like a warm washcloth warm
water or steam and what do we have in
our shower we have a steam shower yes
and it works amazing it's amazing huh
besides having sex in it it really opens
up them pores so I think you I think
you're ready to roll I think I'm ready
to roll so we're going to zoom in and
sorry if you don't want it this close
but what about all right guys here goes
nothing
oh my God look at that oil and dirt
offer two little swipes alright so I'm
gonna do his whole nose and way before
we even go on how did that water swipe
just feel weird it's not too bad it's I
can feel I can feel pulling on my nose
for sure alright definitely weird we're
going in for more baby oh you feel that
suction I'm hearing that dip baby that
 did for my guy oh let's just go
let's go and baby let's go in okay oh
yes no let's go back in with her oh my
god okay we gotta zoom in so y'all can
see the look at all that oil oh
I don't know why that wants to me choke
okay that is like real oil and tur from
your nose I don't know why I'm like uh
seeing it closed up like right here I'm
like oh my god yeah that's kind of
gnarly I'm like where does it tissue
 this is nasty
let's finish you off
alright let's finish you oh my god
really pulls your skin yeah no it's no
joke oh my god
I'm gonna do this to my China show that
oil I can't do it y'all I'm done after
this that is gonna make me throw up
ohh
mm-hmm think about something pleasant
okay
all right so how did that feel it was it
was different it felt like you know the
vacuum cleaner when you like put it on
your skin yeah it kind of pulls it yeah
yeah but it's like much much smaller you
know any pain no no pain really I mean
maybe if you leave it in one spot for
too long it probably might just might
start hurtin leave a red spot right I
mean I'm looking like really close up
like right in front of him I'm like I
don't think it like extracts blackheads
necessarily like I don't think it's that
powerful it almost feels like like it's
a very like kid packaging but yeah it
feels a little cheap uh-huh um it
definitely pulled out a lot of like
little whiteheads and yeah a lot of oil
I'm like that I don't know how usually
I'm not like squeamish around anything
but that secretion is nasty I'm not
down for saying that up close oh my god
yeah if you're watching this and you're
at dinner or lunch I'm really sorry if
you threw up or if it bothered you ah we
had no idea what was about what day was
about to happen

like a $24 product what do you think was
it worth it I mean maybe maybe I
wouldn't I wouldn't go out of my way
