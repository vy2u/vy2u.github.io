I got a big dick wanna take a lick I
wear lipstick a bitch I got a big
dick
wanna take a lick what's up everyone
welcome back to my channel and today
we're doing a little special edition
Valentine's makeup tutorial now
I haven't dated anyone in like six years
so when I hear Valentine's Day makeup
I'm like ah but hey I finally have a
Valentine and you know Nathan loves me
with extreme makeup with no makeup with
a little bit on so I was like well how
do I do a Valentine's Jeffrey look and I
wanted to do something that I don't
normally do
so I tone it down but I still kept the
high fashion and high glamour so I hope
you guys enjoy this and for the special
Valentine's weekend coming up I have
Nathan finally doing my makeup oh my god
we're filming in a few days and is he
nervous
you better be something else
that I'm really excited about is we are
hitting our one-year anniversary so I'm
gonna take me Nathan and my best friend
to Maui and we're gonna have a little
Hawaii adventure should we log about it
you don't want to see footage from that
if you do leave some feedback below and
I hope you guys enjoy watching this look
alright let's get started now for this
Valentine's soft moment I definitely
want more of a dewy skin look huh I know
that's strange coming from me so I'm
gonna be using that Becca cosmetics
backlight primer I am NOT a spy and I'm
going to be using my damp Beauty Blender
and I just take this and I'm gonna put
two pumps right on there and then we're
gonna dog around just like I do with my
foundation and just spread this primer
all around the whole face all right we
are done you guys thank you so much for
watching just kidding okay so now that
the primer is done I am going to start
mixing some foundations now I'm gonna go
a little different than I normally do
and
you guys know I love my Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation this has been
my go-to for all of last year they also
have something called fluid shear which
has like a metallic shimmer with it so
you can mix this into your foundation it
kind of gives you a more glowy vibe so
I'm gonna mix these two today now you do
want to shape this very good before
using oh my wrist roots okay so we'll
just do a little two pumps there on the
back of the hand now this glowy stuff
you just put right in there now I'm just
going to use that end of my Beauty
Blender and just mix and then let's see
what happens okay let's get to buffing
now this foundation is really light I'm
gonna add some more coverage with powder
and concealer but I feel like if you're
I feel like if you're having a
Valentine's Day date with your spouse
boyfriend girlfriend or someone off of
tinder you want to wear less foundation
because when you have sex it just gets
all over their face and clothes so just
be respectful for concealer I'm gonna be
using the amazing cosmetics amazing
concealer now I got this a while ago and
I forgot I had it and I'm gonna use it
today so I'm just going to use a tiny
bit on my middle finger and just dab it
under the eye oh this just feels so good
now I am going to set my whole face with
powder and do my brows off-camera like I
have been doing lately so if you want to
go see how I create all that go back and
look to my channel and I will be right
back alright and we're back now I didn't
want to contour off-camera because I got
these new makeup geek contour powders
and I haven't used them yet so let's use
them together so I'm gonna dab into this
guy right here the shade is called
breakup and let's see how they look I'm
just gonna start creating that natural
I'm gonna kill you bitch face
Consort chic look now I'm gonna bring it
up a little bit on my near the hairline
and drag it up a little bit no I'm gonna
be taking this makeup forever big old
fan brush and I'm just gonna go back in
with that contour color and just chisel
out this chin a little bit for that
define look and I'm just going to soften
that line with my Beauty Blender for the
nose today I'm actually just going to
take this brush and put a little product
on it just halfway here and I'm just
going to take it and run it down my nose
where I want the color to stay just a
quick little two-second nose job if you
will
now I'm really defining the nose and I'm
going to soften it in a second so if it
looks a little too crazy
you can always tone it down like this is
for Valentine's so I want my nose like
severe I don't want to break up with me
because I didn't define her enough now
that my nose looks crazy I'm going to
take the Beauty Blender and just buff
over both lines and just kind of soften
them a little bit okay
now let's get to the eyes all right now
for eyes today I'm gonna keep it really
really simple like you guys are going to
be blown away how easy this is for
Valentine's I want it to be really soft
really pretty so I pulled out my Too
Faced chocolate bonbon palette I love
this one first of all it's pink so I'm
already obsessed and oh that chocolate
smell kills me I'm just going to dip
into this color divinity which is a
really light nude color and I'm just
gonna take this from brow to lid and
just coat my entire eye with it you
apply these you smell the cocoa powder
and you're like instantly hungry I'm
like oh I want an ice-cream sundae right
now with a Cinnabon and strawberry
lemon-aid oh my god now this color
almost matches my skin tone which is
exactly what I wanted it's just gonna be
a little base for us to get started and
make sure our eye shadows blend
seamlessly all right now I'm just gonna
put a really soft brown color in the
crease and I'm going to use my morphe
four-for-one brush now the shade is
called almond truffle right here it's
like a release
off Bobby Brown I like to cut the brush
completely and really get the color in
there and then bitey and we're just
gonna tuck this into my crease and this
is a really soft color we're gonna be
really gentle today I'm so used to
seeing like bright colors are really
bold right away I'm like huh like I'm
not wearing anything my wrist is like
bitch add more color all right now for
the lid I'm gonna use a metallic bronzy
color this is called molasses chip and
this is this guy right here I'm gonna
just take my Mac to one seven brush and
just dip in there now usually with
metallics like to wet the brush for a
crazy effect let's see if this one wants
to show up on my lid today oh I love
that really soft alright now I'm going
to take this NARS eyeshadow it just came
out and it's called tar beause it's like
this pretty mint like greenish color I
love and I'm actually going to add this
green color on the top of some of the
brown just to give it some extra flavor
and I'm gonna just wet the brush always
with my mac's fix+
now when you use these wet like they
recommend it's like woo so let's see
what happens
oh I live for a bitch and I'm just going
to place it directly in the middle so
I'm not doing my whole lid just the
center now normally I would add a lot of
darkness to my crease but I'm actually
gonna not do that today oh god I feel so
weird all right now to soften those
edges I'm gonna be taking the same
almond truffle color here and just
buffing over it and over it real quick
alright now for under the eye I'm gonna
keep it really soft and gentle and I'm
gonna take this color in the palette
called satin sheets it's like a
champagne Isha Marie peachy I don't know
it's just it's amazing I'm gonna take my
Mac 239 brush just a little guy and just
dip in there
I want to coat that whole brush and I'm
just gonna go right in the inner corner
and add in that color and I'm gonna
bring it slightly down where it's a
little bit under the eye just a little
soft effect you know what's cool about
these eyeshadows is you can actually use
this color as
highlight which I did the other day and
it looked so pretty
so there's ever anything metallic in
your palate dip it in honey in bay those
cheeks okay so now that that's done I'm
just going to take that same morphe four
or one brush and I'm gonna dip into this
color one more time and I'm actually
just gonna take it under my eye and just
lightly buff under it so it just gives
you that soft brown look I'm just gonna
slightly drag that shadow out a little
bit okay
now what is gonna make these eyes stand
out really crazy I think is that mascara
and the big lashes
once you add those things to your eyes
it always gives you that like huh okay
there it is look alright now I'm gonna
take my Too Faced better than sex
mascara and coat the entire top and
bottom before we do some lashes now
let's do the bottom mascara now when you
don't have a lot of dramatic eyeshadow
underneath you want to be really careful
not to bump your skin with a brush so
I'm just going over this a few times so
it's like extra tarantula now I want the
lashes to be the main focus of this look
since it's so soft and gentle so I'm
going to be using the Buddha Beauty
Farrah lashes now it's time to put some
lash glue on and get these bitches on
one I am obsessed with how these look
they're so like wooo
they almost look like eyelash extension
they're so pretty I'm probably never
gonna take them off they oh thanks
all right now for highlighting today I'm
going to be going in with with that with
the with the with a for highlighting
today I'm gonna do a gold tone and I'm
gonna be using the new Burberry
highlighter this is nude gold and oh
isn't she so pretty
oh my god there's another one that I'm
going to be filming with soon so get
ready because these are insane
and I'm gonna be using my morphe 310 fan
brush it's gonna be now these are like
whoo these are insane oh my god yes glow
my whole goal in life is when I walk
outside for my neighbor's to have to
like squint their eyes when they're
staring at my face so let's keep packing
this on hmm ghandar the Cupid's bow and
I'm gonna do all down the nose like I
want this bitch highlighted I'm almost
going to take my fingertip and just do
the end of my nose all right the
highlighting is done now what I'm going
to do for the lips all right since it's
so dry out and I've been a little under
the weather I'm gonna be using a lip
scrub from my own brand and this is the
strawberry gum flavor now hi she's been
used so good I'm just going to take a
little bit out and my hand and just
scrub lick I like to go in circular
motion so it gets off all that dryness
cool thing about these they're edible so
if you're feeling a little hungry while
you're doing your makeup just dip your
finger and have a little snack girl I
want to go for a really baby pink soft
porn star hooker type of lip so I'm
gonna be going in with that MAC
Cosmetics Bianca B this is a really like
sheer baby pink oh wow it is really it
that's actually more pigmented than I
thought
it's so crazy this pink is so light it
almost looks white on me like hey okay I
literally feel like dave chappelle when
he was pretending to be a crack addict
so I'm actually gonna take the Beauty
Blender and just sheer this down a
little bit and I'm gonna put this on a
Stassi ahh
lip gloss on top this is shade pastel
pink and let's see if we can get this to
look a little more oh there we go
hi know you guys know I'm not a fan of
lip gloss but mmm I am loving this look
all right and now to finalize this look
we are going to be going in with the
Urban Decay all nighter setting spray as
usual
this look is complete all right this is
the final look I hope you guys enjoy
this it's definitely something a little
out of my comfort zone but I have to be
a little dangerous um I think this is
perfect for any everyday hi I'm gonna go
on a date with my boyfriend and maybe do
a gangbang or a date at the fondue
restaurant you know this is just a
simple little look I'm feeling very
girly I'm feeling very saw like I don't
know I just feel really dainty wearing
this makeup I want to prance around the
house and heels and uh well you know the
rest I hope you guys enjoyed watching
this and I will see you on the next one
