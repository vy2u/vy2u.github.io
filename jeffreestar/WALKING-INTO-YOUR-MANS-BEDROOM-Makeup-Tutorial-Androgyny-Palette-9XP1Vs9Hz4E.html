keep on watching alright we're going to
go in with the grill on your goals

is one of my go-to as of 2016 so we're
going to bring her right back on the
face
all right now for foundation we're going
to go in with the allow Curry's skin
caviar which I reviewed this crazy-ass
 on my channel last year it works
amazing and it has skin care benefits
and SPF in there so if you want to take
this flip to the base you can next we're
going to go in with the Tarte shape tape
it's the best light is easy full
coverage but still really light the
magic in there
okay and next we're going to use these
Chanel natural finish powder need this
under the eyes anywhere that we did
highlight so down here under the eyes

alright now to put all over the face
we're going to go in with the Giorgio
Armani luminous silk foundation compact

little bit darker and use the Auburn
from anastasia dipbrow ones a row row
I'm going to use me a little bit darker
just to pop all these dark colors that
we're going to do on the eyes and now
that my hair is a darker pink I've been
using the Auburn a lot more and I'm kind
of living for it great well I can't look

carve out these brows even in palate
give them snatch to fill
we're going to take a little bit of
China white from the beauty color
palette doable setting well sitting
under my brow bone new friendship
resides with the Paint Pot for mac and
painterly come on painterly so I'm going
to actually carve out this cut crease of
poison and blend out with military but
before I do that just like in our red
smokey eye video I like to carve out
with cream so I'm going to take
breakfast at tiffany's dirty money in
crocodile tears mix all together to kind
of get something like poisoned and then
you're gonna see me carve that out first
and then we'll pack on the shadows on
top of that the first thing I'm going to
do is use frosting all of the lid I'm an
equals x plus two wet it and just pack
it on with my finger
so these are the three I'm going to mix
together to try to make a color kind of
similar to poison in the palette so I
can cut the crease first with this one
cocktail nicolo's blue cocktail hmm wait
a little boys is right on top of one
I'm going to go ahead and take some
military I'm a tiny little Cosette bless

do something and people do this and just
go right on top of the poison cool

like I'm letting Nicole use all these
new things today so this is the artist
and punker liquid liner okay I love this
one you give a little shake and it
really stays wet a lot of these
applicators like they add right other
brands into my girl so you're going to
use this one and then you're going to go
