back to my channel we're going to some
crazy shit today yeah you are
yeah I'm not afraid but mace is about to
skate the world's most expensive staple
so if you want to see the unboxing and
him skating it - keep on watching keep
on fucking watch are you guys so before
Nathan and boxes everything for you I
want to give you a quick backstory that
this collection was so hard to get ahold
of but just from being such a loyal
Louis Vuitton client they offered this
crazy trunk for me so there is literally
like 10 made in the entire world
you know me I'm fucking over the top as
always so when it comes to Nathan's
birthday I'm like bitch but we are going
to take it there and make his jaw drops
so yes this is a crazy ass fucking price
tag the grand total with tax is a fifty
nine thousand two hundred and sixty
eight dollars with seventy six cents you
can't forget that baby is it over the
top yet so it was my whole entire life
these things are so cool because they
are collectors pieces and even in one to
five years this will probably be tripled
in value because it is so rare so I'm
going to let you guys go on a little
journey with me as he unboxes everything
for you then of course you saw at the
skate park we're going to see if it's
motherfucking board works alright so
we're about to open up this trunk and
see what we got going on in here oh shit
okay I got a nice strap looks like you
can strap this right on here Logan over
the shoulder if you need to let me use
this
they actually even look like they even
have have nice truck in here yeah their
independence probably one of the most
biggest well-known trucks like Trump
brand ever made so that's that's really
nice to see and the fact that they just
put the little supreme logo on that it's
so sick we even got the Louis Vuitton
strap on here there's like a ratchet
almost it's pretty tight
bones Swiss bearings okay come in with
that good shit that's what's up we've
got some secret compartments down here
alright let's check out what we got in
here okay pretty much just like some
storage areas probably you know put some
trucks in here I'll know that is
actually four trucks yeah these little
things little bolts you can just sit
your trucks right down in it that's
tight oh we got some secret stuff in
here got this little pouch or something
in here let's check it out all got the
nice basic tool I mean can't go wrong
does everything you need on the
skatepark so wonder what this is for oh
just election stuffing in Hanks probably
throw some bearings or aving some little
hardware or something well since we're
about to skate for the one time only
multitudes back in here oh my god
Jeffrey did not he got my initials put
on a little tag I don't even own this
one too check that out that is so sick
okay look baby tonight and ready to go
I'm ready let's go I've got some shoes
to match your board alright let's try it
out how is it by the way I'm like I know
nothing about cable with you guys so it
is a really nice job really oh yeah they
did
oh yeah like griptape - can't go wrong
with it I love this little detail yeah I
know they went in on everything really
all right well let's go give this a
whirl and see what she's made of
all right well I'm going to roll around
the park and see how this bitch handles
all right so Nate just skated it for one
lap and look at ya I mean look it just
because Louis Vuitton doesn't mean II
think it's great yeah the normal stuff
yeah but let's give it look super print
see what I'm scared of Oh what was at
the board side yes I did an ollie board
slide too regular and then I tails put
on the spine over there
okay so lever at home if they're really
like maybe people some people never even
skateboard before I'm sure a lot of you
at home have but how did it feel
writing it for the first time where the
shitty would've oh not so smooth the
bearings that they have on here probably
one of the best bearings that you can
have thank God oh alright
she's butter alright let's go laughs
Nate have fun for a few minutes and do
what happened
Oh what's it happen mgg countdown
without fucking self sorry okay yeah no
I'm good I just hit a soft spot on my
elbow and like pick up my arm are you
good though I'm good I don't know if the
board is okay let's zoom in right here
holy shit what did I a little cracker
plate yeah I mean this would be a break
this would be ko and I think you get
that shit hard I did and I fuck I was
floating for a minute damn it from the
back of the propane oh you can't tell
down here it's just on the top view ply
is it okay to still write anything I can
still skate it but I got to be careful
yeah this shouldn't break sit half
Louise better should you grow a new one
you
in
you
now
all right so we are back home it was
really high out there it was so hot me
like dripping sweat yes
okay so let's give your final first
impressions on the board overall design
compared to a normal good skateboard how
would it be I would say it's pretty much
the same as your average Pro you know
pro skateboarder you know pro deck or
pro anything redone okay so we'll zoom
in on some of the we got some discuss
it's great obviously it got a little
crack here yes it did get a little crack
what biggest fears the one hella what
were you doing I was doing just an air
over the spine and I was doing an indie
grab as I was doing it but I shot out
too far and my foot was too far up on
the right game board so I put all my
pressure on this and it just your kids
on that baby yeah this is I do they want
to see the skateboard train so we do
have a break in the board obviously I
wanted me to write it yeah and I
definitely wrote it so I mean and you
can't blame it's not it's not the the
brand or Louie didn't make a shitty
skateboard or anything it was just it's
more of a common occurrence I mean just
because you know Louis made it don't
mean that it's shitty and it broke
actually that's a really nice skateboard
and I just landed on it wrong right days
ago I broke a skateboard and like three
or four days it just happened you know
so so is the Louis Vuitton supreme
corporation skateboard legit you happy
it's definitely frigid I mean you
couldn't ask for anything better really
I mean a lot of the stuff on here is
top-tier right well maybe you'll put
that one in a glass case yes we will and
then I am going to put it out there that
I am going to ask Louie Vuitton to order
and buy a pristine board to put back in
here if not it doesn't matter it's our
collector's item the trunk alone is
unreal yeah and offered it to us which
is so fucking cool but yeah
I'm happy are you guys thank you is so
much for watching another crazy video of
ours I hope you enjoyed it and I might
go shut it here for that crack in the
board I know I I'm probably going to go
shit a couple all right you guys we love
you and we'll see you on the next one
bye guys see it in my</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
