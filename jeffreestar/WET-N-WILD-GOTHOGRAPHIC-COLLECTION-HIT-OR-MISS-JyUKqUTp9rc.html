it could be about my skin or you could
just say hi how are you so that is it
are you guys excited because I am
alright
guys besides that let's dive into a
sweat in a Wilder view and see what the
hell is going on alright now we all know
that the drugstore brands have been
really coming hard lately in the last
six months of 2017 I was a little
shocked at how aggressive they came with
packaging from the formulas being a lot
better like listen I've said this before
in videos but if you're new here I have
been doing makeup for 15 years and wet
and wild and a lot of drugstore brands
back in the day when I was first doing
makeup in like eighth and ninth grade
the formulas were a little low but girl
I am proud of wet and wild and I hope
that they continue we don't know what's
in here of course but I hope they
continue their greatness because they're
mermaid collection last year so late and
I was actually really shocked because
this brand is so affordable so do we
know what is inside here today no but
we're gonna test it all and see what the
hell happens let's show off the box
let's give you guys a whole little
rundown and let me tell you what this
collection is about so here we are the
box is open now wet and wild is calling
this a new era of goth where dark meets
light moody meets bright this is not
your mother's goth meet Gotha graphic a
world where unicorns have perished but
they're holographic shadows remain
resulting in an unexpectedly bold color
statement pastels are offset with a
bright pop and skulls glow with
holographic dimension girl whoever wrote
that work I do love the theme I love the
white and wild is playing on the whole
unicorn trend they actually did their
own unicorn thing last year and brands
are still making unicorn stuff now and I
think most of you if there's a few of
you out there who are grilling and
grappling onto unicorns
that's alright but most of us were over
it okay thank you so this is actually a
really cool idea love the theme now the
first thing I want to try out because
I'm looking at my face in the monitor
yes I have foundation on contour blush
concealer I need a highlight on so
before I do any lip swatches or anything
on the eyes we are going to test out all
three formulas today I'm like damn girl
wet and wild I'm also in the press
release I love how it said this is not
your mother's golf
first of all ten years ago in high
school I was gothic insert picture here
and insert picture here yes that's
exactly how I used to look black
lipstick spiky hair and actually won
best hair in the yearbook
don't hate me let's dive into this
review this is the Wet n Wild moon tears
loose highlighting powder now just from
looking in the jar you guys can see it
looks blinding in there so I'm kind of
like alright and now a little bit about
this product you guys let me tell you
the Realty this is only $6.99 holy shit
that's cheap and amazing now this is
cruelty free gluten free fragrance free
and this is a vegan shade it's buildable
it's shimmery it's a powder perfect for
face and body contains nylon oh girl
like pantyhose or what are we talking
here contains nylon to help promote
blend ability and impart an elegant
silky texture I'm not mad at it let's
give it a fucking try for $6.99 girl I'm
like shook all right now a cool thing is
hold on look at that that is really cute
I love that it says peel here now my
real nails are growing along you guys I
know bitch needs a fill right we got the
sticker off here we go I'm just gonna
literally tap some on my hand right here
oh fuck oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa I'm
like buildable bitch that's a fucking
mirror okay okay this was really soft
the texture is smooth it's not gritty
oh my didn't explode in my face thank
God I have asthma oh I'm getting a call
from my lawyer girl one second I might
be getting sued or extorted right now
whoa all right we're in the clear it's
actually something exciting I'm working
on a big collaboration with someone but
what did I happen to that later all
right you guys so first of all first
impressions this highlighter is really
cute are we living for the little mirror
effect cuz I am so this is for face and
body I love it there's a lot of other
highlighters in here so I don't want to
rub it all over my face I'm gonna take a
little bit just put it right here
uh-huh uh-huh and yes we're gonna blend
it we're gonna fucking blend it I just
want to look like a beacon for a second
oh I like it it is kind of more subtle
all right so so far is so good moon
tears appears to be really cute all
right next
is the mega glow highlighting stick and
what is a shade called hell Oh darkness
alright it looks something like this
love all the skulls on the packaging
just from looking at it this almost
looks like a milk makeup they're
holographic stick so this guy is $6.99
as well it's packed with
multi-dimensional pearl pigments this
highlighting stick will give you an
intense glow alright so they're claiming
that it is going to be intense so I
guess we're just gonna give this a whirl
when you open it up okay so it comes
very protected I love that Oh Q it's
literally a top you can put back on so
you don't damage it when you travel I'm
going to assume so we're just going to
scoot that up I'm just gonna take it and
put it directly on my skin alright I
mean there's really only two ways to
apply it you take it with a brush or a
sponge and you apply or you can just go
directly on the face let me get it
warmed up on my hand here oh okay so it
does have that really pretty iridescent
it does look very bright it doesn't feel
too sticky it doesn't feel too tacky I
mean you got it's blending out really
cute okay well I'm just gonna apply it
directly to my skin so let's see what
happens here oh girl all right now you
can literally just take your finger and
I'm just gonna Pat it in now we do have
a lot of powder and foundation on so you
never know how it's going to interact
with what's you know under the product
so this will be a good little test oh
wow that really does look really pretty
it's like angelic alright girl I'm like
for $6.99 I think this is one of the
best stick highlighters I've used on my
channel a lot of the times you try to
blend it out and it like wipes off your
foundation or it looks streaky and weird
and this one it looks cute so I'm just
gonna keep that on I'm just gonna put a
powder over it for fun so let's move on
they have more highlighters I'm like
gosh alright so let's move on to another
highlighter I'm like damn how many
formulas can you all do so we have the
highlighting powder the mega glow
highlighting powder if you will and I
have talked about these on my channel
several times throughout the last year
and they keep putting out more shades
which thank God because these actually
really work so when you open it up it
does have a skull imprint this shade is
its limited edition it is called white
Raven $4.99 I think I forgot about you
P's were I know it's kind of cheating to
put it
over the cream it's gonna really be
crazy but I just feel naked
first of all let's do a little finger
swatch ooh oh wow it literally is like a
powder version of the cream that's on my
skin I'm just gonna take this right here
and do a little BAM well first of all
let's take it with a fan brush let's
dust around I'm just gonna put it
directly over this one shall we Oh bitch
you see that you see how that looks fuck
a contour my contour needs to like go to
bed you're dismissed contour no one
cares about you anymore honey Oh oh my
god I want to like put this on my brow
bone I want to put this on my everything
Wow okay let's move on to the next shade
so the next shade is called purple ashes
and it looks like this it's like a pinky
duochrome type of thing the undertone is
like a violet purple let's take a clean
finger here and let's see what happens
oh it looks like this kinda hard to tell
let's do it right next to the other one
sorry I'm not flipping you guys off BAM
oh wow
it's very eat the roll and iridescent
it's different definitely better for
medium or darker skin tones and it does
have a little fine Mica's of glitter if
you guys can see that in there let's
just try it on my other cheek I got no
highlighter over here
let's dab into here
mm-hmm
it's subtle obviously you guys can see
it's subtle but I'm not minding it it's
like pretty I'm also gonna take a little
bit of this and just do it on my Cupid's
bow see if we can get some glowing going
on there oh yeah it's subtle I mean I'm
looking over here like so this is really
not for me I think it's cute I would
wear if I was wearing not a lot of
makeup and probably just like little
bronzer a little highlight but it is
pretty it's just not my favorite all
right so we have the highlighting
section from the Gotha graphic
collection out of the way now we are
going to dive into some eye stuff whoa
what the hell are these these are okay
let's hold them up so these are the mega
last liquid cat suit liquid eye shadow
this is gonna give your eyes a
holographic edge with this high-impact
liquid glitter shadow features pearl
pigments which combine for a multi color
shimmer effect these are only $4.99 each
there are four shades of course like I
mentioned let's put a few of my eyes I
mean hi I literally have nothing going
on here except some primer the only
thing I don't like about drugstore
brands is sometimes the packaging you
know if anyone has any sort of nail
length peeling all this stuff off I'm
like girl this shade is called pure
intention and I'm just gonna put it on
my lid first of all the packaging feels
sturdy I like it it's cute nothing like
mind-blowing but it is cute okay so this
is what the DOE foot looks like it is
flat probably easier to see it against
my backdrop sorry let's just take a
little bit and see what happens
oh so it went on super easy feels a
little cooling it isn't like yeah this
was a little wet it's a very
extraterrestrial I want to like throw on
some mascara and that's it maybe like a
dark lip and I'm just like wow we're
trying a different one alright so this
one is mystic dreamer and this one looks
like this it's more of like a pinky
silver Toddlers and Tiaras like I'm
gonna cut your head off moment let me
just see what happens over here guys
okay okay oh oh how are we feeling this
one definitely has a little bit of like
that pinky undertone that I love but the
base looks very similar to this one okay
let's swatch the other two I know this
one is called goth tears I love that
name is a very more like blueish purple
very dreamy I'm just gonna take a little
bit of this you guys ready for this
let's just really take it there are we
gonna go we'd go in there we're going
there whoa this is very duochrome E and
I'm kind of here for it like she would
do a wing do we pull it out or we're
just gonna take it there and just like
say fuck it whoa okay kind of living for
this not bad this shade is called Nick
doe philia and if you're wondering what
the fuck that means it means someone
that loves being in the dark or the
darkness I'm running out of space here
everybody so I'm just gonna do a little
swatch right here in my hand it's a hand
swatch channel BAM oh this one has a
darker base imagine putting that over
like a black shadow or something gray or
like even a liner cute it definitely
needs to go over something as you guys
can you guys can see it's a little
streaky right there but definitely put
it over something if you want it to pop
but the other ones by themselves are
stunning I love how they look definitely
give you that really cool dimension and
in person they're very eye-catching like
when I'm looking in the mirror right
here I'm like I just can't stop staring
at it
so okay not bad I live for it let's move
on
all right now I'm gonna do a little bit
of mascara so I don't look crazy I need
a little bit of like Vavoom here please
oh hey what you doing baby oh my god
this hi hi you want some I'm good just
doing a little wet and wild review what
do you think about this highlighter it's
wild it's blinding it's like crazy
florescent what about this underneath
that blue is intense it's cool on its
really pretty it's like blue uh-huh
reminds me of like some ocean stuff
isn't right I look like a mermaid II
yeah what's the queen of mermaids called
it's got some lips to do and then we'll
go on a date yeah all right that Cupid's
bow dou ah that's cute huh let's dive
into some liquid lipsticks now there are
four shades here oh it's like a grey we
got rose gold we got this crazy blue
with glitter so these are all metallics
so we got four metallic liquid lips
these are $4.99 and let's just starts
watching them I think we need to go with
this one first or you give me so like
just look at that color looks like
there's glitter in there the shade is
called pastel grunge and let's open her
up and see what happens
oh wow I mean I'm down to wear these
colors but girl okay y'all see that it's
a law chunky you know sometimes when you
pull something out for the first time it
could be a little weird so we're gonna
give this a second go let me just stir
it up in there okay let's try that again
girl okay this blue one is a little
stray key not living for it yet mmm
okay this shade is a note for me let's
wipe it off and try another one
my lips are a little dry so I'm gonna
put on some of my own lip scrub this is
blue raspberry sucker and girl we need
to exfoliate this melt alright let's
move on
let's try wicked pink it looks like a
little rose gold ma vie baby pink moment
and okay looks a little more smoother on
the applicator let's give it a whirl
girl
Wow wild are you playing me did you just
come so hard with all these damn
highlighters and the liquid lips are not
hitting what is going on or I'm taking
the wand I'm stirring start one more
time uh-uh
it's just like this is not it I'm like
is this a lip topper no this Lily says
metallic liquid lipstick I'm like are
y'all seeing what I'm seeing it's like
barely there I can literally still see
my real lip color underneath like what
happened where the pigment go let's try
the third shade this is a metallic grey
as you can see it is cold I'm looking
I'm that person gunmetal heart alright
I swear to God if this one don't work
I'm coming for blood my lips like
rejecting this today I'm literally gonna
put this on my hand
I mean mama that is sheer it's just the
payoff on these are not great I'm like
am I like delusional or what first of
all this is like not a girl
yeah they're all right on my hand but
it's still streaky and it's like this
would actually be really pretty is like
eye shadow but the lips are not hitting
all right you guys I am sadly
disappointed in these metallic liquid
lips usually wet in a wild can kill it
with their matte liquid lipstick formula
but these ones are just really not
hidden so let's move on to the eyeliner
that's rough it is a rough dark world
out there now we are moving on to the
liquid eyeliners there are three shades
my OCD is let go over here these are of
course limited edition as well these are
metallic liquid eyeliners featuring
pearl pigments which combined for a
multicolored shimmer effect and it's
supposed to have a punch of color with
high impact we'll see about that shall
we let's go into the first one scull
prayer it looks something like this I
don't really use their liquid liners
much but I'm down to give it a whirl
this is what the applicator looks like
very thin and let's zoom in on my hand
and has been swatch to filth today oh
okay
letting bad of course it was a little
streaky but hey when you finesse it into
the skin that is definitely a metallic
like pearl white liner so I haven't
definitely not mad at that moving on
let's try the next one
this one is called pink coffin I wish
this was a matte pink eyeliner that
would be sickening but let's see what
the metallic looks like if we really
don't do metallic pink liners but I'm
here for it the tones alright it's a
little kind of like milky and sheer like
I'm not really getting that much
metallic it's like uh I wish it would've
been a lot better because obviously pink
is not just my favorite color it's my
life so wet in a wild I'm a little mad
at you right now
this next one what is this one called
black butterfly see I wish it was that
color purple like a matte purple liner
would be sick let's give this a whirl
this is what this one looks like oh wow
yeah these are not bangin the white one
actually works that these two are like
just to sheer and I really don't think
they are going to look a snap
honey I so those are kind of like for me
but looking down on my table I have now
swatched and tried everything in the
entire collection so let's give our
final thoughts no shocker here the star
of the show was this highlight
combination I've stared at myself in the
monitor for about an hour now I'm tired
and he knew NAB okay but for real this
Plus this equals ah and I really
recommend these two I love them together
yeah the one of course I said was a
little more subtle and not my cup of tea
but it is pretty I'm over here looking
at her like okay she bad so this one is
cute now I'm moving on to the loose
highlighter I think it's really cute you
can honestly take this rub it all over
your body and ready for a glow you can
mix it in with lotion and give your body
an extra little shimmer so I definitely
think for the price this is awesome
kinda reminds me of an old Mac powder
that looks like this so for this price
point girl to natch this one up now what
else are we gonna dive into girl I'm
looking down like I lived for the liquid
eye shadow like look at how that stayed
it just looks pretty like I don't know
giving me very like Coachella slutty
just pretty vibes I really love these
they're awesome I hope that they come
out with more colors because I am here
for it now moving on to what I was not
into I am really shocked that these
metallic lips flopped this hard usually
they come a little harder and they are a
lot more blendable but the pigment weird
it's just not here and I'm not sure what
happened they look so pretty in the
vials but they were just not it for me
now moving on to the liquid eyeliners
the pearl one was the only one that
really stood out to me you guys saw this
in the close-up no not happening
these did not work they were too streaky
and they're just not it but this one was
actually really cool so we're gonna have
to try this out in a future video but
that is the entire gough the graphic
collection sound off below what do you
guys think what did you guys like on me
what did you hate I want to know your
feedback and of course do not forget to
