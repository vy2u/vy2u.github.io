channel today I am doing a what's in my
bag video now I know I do a million
tutorials but I'm like okay I need to
switch it up a little bit
I've been trying new things I did a what
in my mouth challenge on many anyways
channel so if you haven't seen that go
check it out oh my god that was a scary
mother effing challenge today I'm here
with a what's in my Birkin now I wanted
to say a little disclaimer
I've watched a million people do the bag
thing bitch this is Geoffrey Stars
Channel we're doing it my way
so I'm just going to keep it real show
you guys what's in my purse all my
favorite stuff that I like to carry with
me throughout the day to keep me sane
and normal and also if you are someone
that looks at a Birkin bag and you're
like oh my fuck that's like basically a
car in a bag um it is but the cool thing
about when you are white trash like me
you will always be a white trash you'll
just have a little bit more money I
think it's a humbling experience when
you grow up looking at all these like
fashion magazines and you see Kim K in
posh spies and Beyonce and they all have
these bags and you're like zoom like I
want to work hard one day and have some
of the stuff not that materialistic
items you know they don't define you as
a person but it's fun it's fun so I
think that a lot of youtubers and
instagramers are like afraid to show off
their stuff bitch I earned it I'm gonna
fuckin I'm showing it off if you still
have a problem with Birkin bags or guys
wearing makeup or with me suckin dick
you can go to the next host channel so
let's get started alright the first
thing that I cannot live without every
day I put one in my purse is a red bull
with a straw now you're probably like
this you really that bougie I have had
all my teeth done meaning my whole mouth
is fake so every tooth you see is
crowned so I love straws they basically
take the liquid to your tongue straight
down your throat so all that you know
nastiness whether it's soda I don't give
a fuck if it's flavored water or
whatever it is it's not really touching
my teeth it's just going right back to
my mouth and you think I'm full of shit
give it a whirl alright now one of my
anti-aging secrets is the
sunglasses I always have big sunglasses
in my bag or probably like anti-aging
now if you drive in which most of you
have a car and you drive to work drive
to the mall drive to get I don't know
but when the sun is shining and you're
squinting while you're driving you're
just creating a million crow's feet and
over time they're gonna be like really
crazy mmm girl no crows be here so I
always put on sunglasses while I am
driving and that basically helps you not
look old now something that's really
essential for any fashion whore is when
you drive your car and you're wearing
big old heels or crazy spiked sneakers
and you have to take off your shoe or
driving I hope oh I just do not like
putting my shoes back on so I love to
carry a shoehorn now if you don't know
what a shoehorn is Google shoehorn and
no this is not a sexual device this is a
for them big ol heels so this is very
essential for driving your car now
something that you may not know about me
is let me find this I have asthma I have
mild asthma and to be really honest
medical marijuana has actually helped me
overcome it which you're probably like
oh girl please yeah the THC actually
helps expand my Airways in my lungs and
over time I've been using my inhaler
less and less over the past two years so
Cheers
and that brings me to my next probably
my favorite item in my bag is every day
before I go to the office
Nathan packs me a fresh bowl so if I'm
ever you know wanted to kill someone in
traffic or I'm at the warehouse and
these bitches got me stressed he has my
back
Amen girl now I always have a stash with
me in case that bull runs empty so uh hi
Black Mamba kosher Jack and what do we
got today Blue Dream is always a classic
now if your state is behind or you live
in another country that is against
marijuana please please move to
California and join us now of course
this is a given I'm sure you guys
already know
but um gotta have the iPhone six-plus
when you live your life on the Internet
you must always have the best quality
photos now speaking of pictures if your
iPhone six is you know not good enough
thank God we brought the selfie camera
shoutout to Noor Vina and honest ostia
Beverly Hills for this amazing camera
BAM we got flawless Instagram photos for
days now if my iPhone is dead or there's
too many people calling gotta have that
secret little Ferrari phone that I
picked up in the car now I also have
like five bags within the bag what does
that mean that basically means that I
have you know categories inside of my
purse
so one bag that I love oh this bitch is
heavy this is like a little makeup bag
you're probably thinking oh how cute he
touches up this foundation and lipstick
throughout the day enough today honey
this is an extra bag for people who are
aggressive evil or just downright awful
now what do we have here oh hi drill
it's basically for any hoe that gets in
my way and then we have the trusty Syrah
ski encrusted handgun now of course it
does have a red cap and it is not real
but from far away it does look dangerous
and some people won't call me faggot
ever again and then we have the amazing
trusty comb you know when my weave hits
the air and it's just a little windy and
it gets a little messy thank God for
combs and also if someone tries to touch
my ass or call me a name I turn to
Dexter and last but not least we have
the Geoffrey start trademark which has
been happening for about ten years now
the trusty amazing god-loving mace gun
hi basically what this does is if
someone is you know harassing me or
trying to rape you in an alley or mug
you this will shoot 25 feet of bear mace
directly in their eyes and what does
that mean everybody
it means they all of a sudden go
completely blind their eyes are swollen
shut and that's a new take off your
heels and go to town by
and last but not least underneath all
that stuff is the touch-ups listen as
soon as I do my makeup I keep my damp
Beauty Blender in my bag so throughout
the date will get dry but if I ever need
to just touch up it's already ready to
go so if you're in the movie theater or
if you're driving traffic you'll always
look perfect oh I love this item it's
always tucked in a little plastic baggie
is high toothpaste toothbrush and our
lovely floss now I'm sorry but if you
you know smoke marijuana or are addicted
to candy like I am throughout the day
you kind of want your mouth to smell
nice I don't want you know Nathan to
kiss me and he's like it'll cool so I
tend to keep these in my bag at all
times because listen no one wants a hole
with plaque also when you want to touch
up your hair have hairspray so right now
I've been using this way one from
Sephora
Oh smells amazing holds amazing I love
hairspray now of course I would be a
dumb bitch not to have my own makeup
brand in my purse so I always like to
carry a velour liquid lipstick on the
lower lip scrub I mean hi in case you
get hungry got a snack and the jeffree
star cosmetics skin frost launching end
of April we're getting down to the last
few items in my bag now I always go out
to business meetings after work I don't
like to go all the way home and you know
change my outfit or bag so sometimes
I'll keep extra clothes in my trunk
and I always keep a bag within the bag
now what does that mean it means that
keep an evening purse inside my bag so I
can now get into a smaller purse and
just move me oh maybe my wallet and
essentials over the cool thing about
this one this is kind of like my hidden
gem it's the secret weapon it's
basically like you know if some dude
gets past all those other weapons thank
God we got the good old trusty meat
cleaver so if a bitch wants to come for
me if you want to come for me hope if
you want to come for me home if you want
to come for me I'll be waiting
lastly I never know what setting spray
want to refresh my facebook throughout
the day usually I'll be driving in the
car
and I'll use my knee on the steering
wheel and I'll give Nathan one of them
and I'll handle the rest and we'll just
be on the 101 having a field day and
last but not least I gotta have my son
with me hi boy hi this is my 9 month old
son
delicious he is my world and I usually
take him everywhere with me hi boy
hi can mommy have a kissy he's the
Sweden and that is the conclusion to
what's in my Birkin bag thank you guys

looking at my monitor and on my damn I
should have done a tutorial on the slug
