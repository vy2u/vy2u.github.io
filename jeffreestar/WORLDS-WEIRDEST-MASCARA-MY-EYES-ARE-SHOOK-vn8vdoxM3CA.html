channel Tuesday do you guys do you guys
like that noise let's try it again
alright you guys so today we are going
to dive in and try allegedly one of the
world's scariest craziest weirdest
mascaras I saw this floating around the
internet and I might be legally blind
after we're done with this review we'll
see but um
alright before we dive into the review I
just closed the won and now it's
something really exciting I know a lot
of you know that my brand and me make
merchandise but on jeffree star
cosmetics calm I just launched all brand
new fall merchandise
I have brand new members only JSC
jackets they look something like this of
course we got the beautiful embroidery
with the pink buttons and stitching and
look at the back boom I've been wearing
these a few times in my videos this last
few weeks and I've been getting so many
comments about them so they are finally
online we got black we got hot pink
which might be my favorite and then we
also got the baby pink this is the
jacket that nate is wearing in the new
star family collection beauty campaign
ads all over the internet and we got a
bunch of new t-shirts we have new
colorways because you guys sold out of
the last run like so fast my head was
spinning so I made a bunch of different
colors for everyone that was like you
know what Tyra is not for me we want
regular colors as well so we got the
black jeffree star approved shirts and
there's a bunch of colors so hop online
I will link it down below in the
description box but anyway enough self
plugging let's get into this damn review
today everybody we are reviewing the new
Avon mega effects mascara now I'm sure a
lot of you are probably sitting at home
right now going hey Vaughn Jeffery
really listen
Avon is a classic staple in
my grandma's makeup I'll give you that I
have never reviewed an Avon product on
my channel before you know me I'm always
brutally honest it's just not for me
like the brand does not speak to me not
really my thing now of course if you are
younger and have no idea about Avon
basically they used to have a bunch of
women all over America maybe the world
I'm not sure that would show up at your
doorstep with samples this is the old
days okay we're talking like I don't
know 70s 80s maybe I should google it
and fact check myself but anyway um
women would show up at your door and say
hey you want to try these samples and
then you would order the full size and
they would ship it to your house or drop
it off I've never really seen people
review Avon ever on YouTube it's
obviously not Instagram friendly but
it's a weird one because when I saw this
online I was like now I got this on
Amazon for literally $4.99 it's a little
weird because it says $4.99 on here but
then it says that used to be $10 plus
399 shipping amazon prime what the hell
is going on alright so let's open this
up because you guys are probably gonna
feel a little weird about this just like
I did so it comes in this unit carton
right here on the box it says that it is
0.317
ounces 307 what's the benefit
10.3 okay so it's literally almost the
same amount as a roller lash a tiny bit
more okay so here we go yes this is a
mascara everybody when I saw this I was
like I don't get it we're about to try
this out so the mascara comes like this
and we're gonna try to open it right now
so basically you are supposed to squeeze
see those little side ridges right here
you were supposed to squeeze them I
think and then pop it open I'm not sure
why don't we read it before we up
my nails so on the box it says grip
sides and rock mascara brush side to
side okay and then it says see inside of
carton to rock a breakthrough lash look
okay to safeguard purity never lend or
borrow your mascara discard after three
months of opening never add water or so
we're gonna zoom in right here because I
don't know if a lot of you are gonna
believe me but this literally says right
above my nail never add water or saliva
I'm sorry I'm like bitch if someone
really spitting in their mascara or
licking the wand what the are some
of you guys doing out there well today
we're not gonna be spitting because we
all know we swallow in this house
alrighty so besides that open here for
instructions on how to rock a break ok
so it has these weird little arrows here
I guess we're gonna peel this back oh
wow this is the weirdest packaging okay
oh okay there's a little instruction
book in here
grip head sides and remove cap Bend
brush to desired angle and apply from
root to tip all right baby let's open
this damn thing up so of course as you
guys can see I have my makeup all on
except mascara so if I look like a
little alien right now that's why
alright so we are going to hold this
down like it said and I'm gonna hit
myself in the face okay so here's the
cap and here is this weird contraption
alright so then it says Rock brush from
side to side and pull out my god this is
the weirdest thing oh I see you
literally have to start let me move my
hands everybody sorry about that
so you literally have to whoa okay let's
pull it out for the first time and see
what the hell is going on oh my god
alright we're going to zoom in on this
crazy thing let's sorry my backdrop is a
little dark so this is the bristles it
literally looks like 10,000 tiny spikes
that are ready to attack almost looks
really clumpy okay I'm the weird one
that's just gonna attach it with my
fingers because I'm a little scared here
hmmm oh look
that they go side to side ah that is so
weird I've never seen a mascara like
this before okay so clearly we all want
to know if it works we are about to find
out so then it says you guys literally
bend and brush so it's literally looking
like the picture is like this it's like
a just like that and you're supposed to
go up in your lashes wow this is really
weird okay first of all let's wipe off
my finger before I get mascara all over
the place lord help me out also real
quickly before we try it I did find a
little tidbit online about this this
says that this breakthrough mascara
provides 24-hour volume leading lashes
darker dense and more dramatic get ready
for a corner to corner lash
transformation with our first ever
wonder brush it bends and adjust to
multiple angles capturing every lash top
to bottom
okay we're enough talking give me a
mirror let's see if this works
okay so clearly we have none on here no
eyelash primer nothing we're going in
straight okay I mean there's only one
way to try it it's to go full force
we're gonna zoom in and let's see what
happens
okay okay we're going in whoa okay I got
a little bit of mascara on my lid of
course this is my first time using this
so it's a little weird oh my god this is
a weirdest feeling okay I'm shaking my
lashes back and forth and I'm combing it
through you let me add a little bit more
and just go through the lashes with one
more time I'm not holding my breath I'm
sweating
let me dunk in and we are going to do
the bottom oh my god that is that sounds
scary all right so it's in there we're
gonna rock it back side to side and here
it is again coated okay let's do the
bottom
okay mommy's a little like whoa taken
aback by this let's put this back in
here now we're gonna let this dry for a
second all right you guys so here is the
Avon mascara side of course and here is
literally nothing so I'm just going to
do a slow little head turn if you will
and let's see the difference
shockingly enough oh sorry about that it
worked okay so this mascara actually
worked I'm sitting here like that was
the weirdest brush I've ever seen even
this Hey it's like a limp dick
girl I'm like Hello what happened you
drank too much okay so let's keep it
hood here the top lashes um they look
pretty like we all can't why let's talk
about the bottom lashes they look great
they really look nice do I like them
little thicker yes but that means you
would probably go in with another coat
Wow
like comparative this actually works so
I'm sitting here like do I do the other
side or do we try it against my favorite
mascara and see the difference because
it's gonna be really hard for me to stop
using benefit if this one's better but I
don't know if it is so let's do a little
mascara battle in the middle of this
video and see if there is a big
difference this cap is a very awkward
okay so let's go in with the roller lash
and let's see what it looks like
here is the benefit roller lash versus
the Avon so we got Avon over here and we
got roller lash from benefit over here
let me look in the zoom in camera and
you guys can tell me if there is a
difference all right so right off the
bat I'm gonna say it I of course am a
conventional person sometimes I don't
like when certain products are turn
weird or there's a different version
like you know mascara is mascara we all
know there's crazy wands and brushes out
there but I definitely think that this
wand performed better than this crazy
contraption no I will say this lets disk
into our review right now first
impressions is that this side does look
pretty there's no denying it I like it I
think it's cool but then when you hop on
over here the bottoms do look very
similar this one looks a little more I
guess spidery and then this one looks a
little more no I don't know I guess a
normal but to me this top looks more
flawless it's more full it's more
dramatic and then this over here they
look a little more fine combed
fine-tooth comb because of the brush but
kind of like this side better for me now
of course if you're gonna work fake
lashes it don't matter what mascara you
use because it's gonna be hidden anyway
but if you were someone that wants a
cute little moment and you want to try
something that's literally only $4.99
girl get this cuz it's weird if you're
someone that's like girl thank you so
much but I'm gonna stick to what I know
then you know you're good but I think
when a product is like Laura Lee says
gimmicky then you know and if it's
affordable give it for fun and if you're
not into it you're not into it but this
mascara definitely worked so I will say
just because I like benefit more it
doesn't mean this isn't cool so we are
gonna give the Avon mega effects mascara
the Jeffrey star stamp of approval
because y'all know it worked as you saw
on camera it's cute
like there's no denying it will I reach
for it every single day
probably not will I use it again yes
because we know when I buy something on
my girl we gotta use it a few more times
so I actually liked how it made the
bottom so maybe I will try it
in a tutorial coming up I'm a little
shocked at that weird ass brush and its
performance like bitch you worked
oh right you guys obviously the reviews
over and the mascara worked but besides
that I just want to say thank you so
much for watching this review and for
being so supportive I mean this year is
I can't leave some ass over we're
getting it October and I just can't
believe how quickly 2017 is flying and
bye I know this is random but it's just
been such a magical journey and I'm just
really happy to be here on YouTube sorry
for this little weird sappy moment but I
just wanted to say I love you guys I
appreciate you and I will see you on the
next video mwah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
