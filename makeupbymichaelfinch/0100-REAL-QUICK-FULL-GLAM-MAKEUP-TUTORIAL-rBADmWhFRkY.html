today I'm going to show you guys how to
get this a 0 to 100 full glam look just
getting straight into it I'm going to go
in with the Kat Von D a low-key
concealer to use as a base of my for my
eyeshadow today and guys my my voice I
do have a bit of a cold at the moment so
it does not sound the absolute best but
then I'm just taking the morphe Beauty
Blender and just blending that out isn't
a morphe blend up Beauty Blender or
sponge I don't even know what to call it
and then I'm just going to be setting
that with some override translucent
powder in the shade Alliance so I'm just
basically baking that more or less and
then I'm just dusting off that excess
powder that is left so I have a nice
smooth base for my shadows now are you
shocked that I'm using the huda beauty
again but I do love this palette now I
have seen this palette in a few
different peoples and makeup full fazer
using makeup products that I hate and
I'm like did you get a botched eyeshadow
palette I just a shadow palette is
literally the best it blends it's so
buildable I just don't understand maybe
they had a different formula maybe there
was some made in different factories I
don't know but I honestly love this
palette so much and I would recommend it
it works for me and it's just it's just
all-around amazing so I'm just building
up that color in there and just making
sure it is fully blended out it does
look a little bit create at the moment
but just wait until I've cleared that
with a makeup wipe and it will all make
sense then I'm just going to go in with
this darker burgundy color called bossy
this mannina and bossy together I like
my literally my favorites and I'm just
blending that up all through my little
hood there my little crease just to make
sure it's all blended and all put
together nicely so I'm just going back
to that first shade that I used
previously and I'm just blending over
the edges and just making sure
everything is completely seamless and
then I'm going to be taking the black
color out of this palette now this black
color and this eyeshadow palette is
literally everything it blends so well
it builds so well it doesn't disappear
when you put other colors over it which
is what I love about it so much also
because it is really hard to find a go
to black
on the market to this day as you can see
I'm just blending over the colors like
going back in and then back out again
that's literally what this whole eye
look is about it's just going back in
and out with colors until you get a nice
looking eye now I'm just going to take
the lip cosmetics glitter glue and just
put that all over my eyelid area and
kind of blend it into that black and
then I'm going to go straight in with
the Mac gold glitter and just pack the
absolute out of that all over my
lid so it is nice and sparkly kind of
just going really gently around where
that black area is because I don't want
to cover up that black shadow because
it's given me a nice little bit of
definition on that out of the use of my
eyes you know now just taking the Bobbi
Brown black gel liner I'm just going to
be doing a wing on my eyes a really nice
big wing because I want this look to be
super dramatic and super crazy and very
different from like the before and after
if you don't Amin so I'm just drawing on
a wing with that gel liner and the
channel liner was actually pretty good
I really don't try out many gel liners
I've really always stuck to the Mellen
cosmetics one and the Inglot AMC gel
liner in the number 77 but I decided to
change it up today and just use the
Bobbi Brown one and I was kind of
impressed with it it really slid really
well over the glitter that was already
on my eyelid so I'm just putting that
all the way into my inner corner and I
went to clean it up and wipe the whole
 thing off so don't do that
just be very cautious when you're doing
that because I literally wipe my whole
wing off and it was such a waste of time
but I fixed it and we got there in the
end
moving on to the face this is the Mac of
strobe cream and I'm just applying a
generous a very generous amount of this
all over my face I have not actually
picked up my Mac strobe cream in so long
and I was so impressed with the way my
skin looks afterwards and I do think
this foundation did shine through it
quite a bit the foundation I used was
the Lemaire
Foundation it was literally $200 and I
actually vomited on the cashier when I
paid for it because that's but it
is such a profound ation it's it's so
well on the skin and it literally smells
like an old rich lady I'm not even
kidding like it smells so good the
coverage I would say is probably light
to medium but it is definitely buildable
so you can build it up to full coverage
um yeah I have been mixing it lately
with the a CMA Foundation so I've just
been using the RCM a kind of like as a
concealer just over some more spots
where I need it you know full of
coverage because they're literally both
the same color and they look so good
when they're on together for money
lips are I'm just going to pop some lip
cream conditioner on that it's just the
GA one it is literally become a part of
my every day makeup routine I cannot
live without it it's so good and it
feels so nice on the lips and it gives
you that really nice glossy look not
like a tacky glossy look I'm just
concealing my chin my Cupid's bow my
nose and my forehead using the Kat Von D
locket concealer like we did on the eyes
and I'm just going to be concealing
underneath my eyes with a very very
generous amount of concealer as always
you guys know how I do it so I'm
probably just applying way too much
concealer as I always do but that's fine
went back to the other side and add some
more and then I'm just taking that same
wolfy sponge and blending it out now
this morphe sponge literally blended it
out exactly the same as a Beauty Blender
woods so I don't even think it's worth
spending $30 on a sponge like I
literally did the other day and I regret
it so much because multi sent me a bunch
of these sponges and they are
amazing even Jacqueline Hill was raving
about them the other days so there you
go get on it guys get on the girl got
the guys and girls get on so I'm just
packing some more right translucent
powder underneath my eyes and baking my
whole nose like I do in every single
makeup video cause I need to because my
nose gets oily over time and then I just
set the rest of my face without
translucent powder as well and literally
got all over my whole eyeshadow
but I just dusted it off and
was all good so I'm just taking that big
fluffy brush and making sure everything
is all set and then I'm sim texting to
be a thousand our eyebrow mascara I
found this in my PO Box the other day
and thought I'd give it a try it's just
basically just like benefit to give me
brow but a cheaper alternative and it's
pretty good does the same job so yeah
I'm just brushing that through my brows
went on now moving on to underneath the
eyes I'm taking these Smashbox eyeliner
gel pencil and this is in the color
fishnet it's basically just a jet black
and I'm just putting that in my water
bindi get off that chair now bindi get
down in D get off and I'm just putting
that underneath my I am basically
dragging it down all through my
waterline and then I'm going in with
bossy and blending that out just on this
really small little cute defined brush
so I can make it super duper smoky and
oh do I make this look super smoky it is
literally down to my cheek that eye
shadow is looked relieved now I'm
getting it's not then I'm just gonna
take a man-eater and just blend that out
as well just on this small little dome
brush is it called a dome brush or
under-eye brush
I don't really know just a small eye
brush I guess and just blending out that
and blending out bossy and then I just
changed my brushes and went in with some
more just to blend it out even more and
make it even more smoky guys get the
drill and then I just went in with a
little bit of black truffle as well just
to really make that nice and smoky and
then I did take a little bit of the
brown color called sandalwood from the
huda beauty palette just to blend
everything together underneath the eye
and I think it looked good and I'm
sweatin did the other eye
moving on to mascara this is the Tarte
lights camera lashes mascara and I'm
popping some of that on my eyes we all
know too how we all know how to apply
mascara we don't need to watch me do it
think hmm
oh my god it's still going I think oh my
god okay we get it
we literally OH
do I actually do this time what okay
moving on to lashes these are the demure
lashes and I'm just using my house of
lashes black lash glue and just some
little blue lashes lashes tweezer
applicate applicators to a bladders the
difference of lash can make though so
important and then just taking the Mac
extended play gigablack lash and just
doing my bottom lashes and now I'm
moving straight on to bronzer I got to
test out the hoola light and I literally
fell in love with it as you can tell by
my reaction it is perfect for my skin
tone it's not your dog who life still
works for some like it still works my
skin tone the original Waller but I feel
like all the light it's just that a
little bit lighter and that little bit
better and you can apply more and it
doesn't look dirty I guess not at all
looks dirty or anything but this is just
so much better for my skin tone and I'm
actually obsessed with it so thank you
so much benefit because I love it so I'm
just you know bronzing everywhere
basically and then I'm going to contour
a little bit further using the park F
princess contour from Tarte this is one
of my all-time favorite contours and
back it is so good perfect for my skin
tone lends out well doesn't grow money
you can add heaps of it very buildable
I'll shut the up now and then for
underneath my eyes I'm just taking the
old fried banana powder and just popping
a little bit on just with a little
tapered brush and on my forehead then
I'm also just cleaning up underneath my
contour just with that same brush now
just for a little bit of color in my
cheeks that I just took the Too Faced
piped or peach blush just for a little
bit of color and then I'm just spritzing
my whole entire face using the mac fix+
before highlighting using the ultra
highlighter or what my god you guys it
is literally everything look at it just
I mean I'm literally done I do have a
discount code for this guys I'll leave
it on the screen now I'm not normally
one to push this card codes but you guys
did ask for it so it is on the screen
right now there you go now for lips this
is the Inglot liquid lipstick in the
number seventeen I guess I don't
actually have names which is kind of
weird but kind of Gorge and then I'm
just taking the UA
a lip treatment and putting that all
over the top of my lips and then just
my whole entire face using the urban
decay D sleek oil control all nighter
setting spray and then just a little bit
more fix plus just the good luck because
why the not and this is literally
the finished look I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I'll see you in
my next one
see ya
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
