today I'm coming right back at you all
with a makeup hacks video now these
makeup hacks are ones that I actually
use and I have used before this is this
isn't testing makeup hacks this is
actually makeup hacks that you can use
in your every single day of life who
knows you might even learn something new
today let's get straight into it is
using sticky tape to get a really crisp
line when you're doing your eyeshadow
you can also use this for eyeliner but
we're going to stick to eyeshadow today
so I normally like to apply it
underneath my lower lash line and join
it up to the tip of my brow just because
that gives me a really like nice angle
and it suits my eye shape because I kind
of want it to elongate your eyes that's
what you're going for when you use
sticky tape as a like a guideline for
your eyeshadow I guess well that's what
I use it for I don't know about anybody
else a chair basically once the
eyeshadow is all done then you just take
the sticky tape off and it looks nice
and crisp and amazing this is one for
all you people who like to do your face
first and your eyes lust now if you're
working with a dark smoky eye or
something if you pack translucent or no
color powder under your eye before you
start your eye shadow because you brake
on your face and you want to your
face up this is going to catch all that
eye shadow and everything that falls
down so once you've done your eyes you
can then wipe off that translucent
powder and voila all the fallout is gone
using a micellar water or a cleansing
water of some sort to clean up your
winged liner now this may sound kind of
sketchy to some people in weird because
it could get quite messy but if you're
one of those people that does your eye
makeup before you do your face makeup
this is going to help you a lot
basically all you need to do is you do
your wing as normal and then you get
some micellar water on an angled brush
or just any sort of brush flick it out
and it cleans it up really nicely an
alternative for this you can also use a
makeup black and if you've got nails
like me you can use your finger and run
it along the edge with a makeup light
but today I'm going to be showing you
guys with the masala water now this one
can be quite dangerous so if you're
young don't do this so I don't actually
have a lighter on here so today I'm just
going to be using a
match so if you use a match match on the
end of your lash band curl our thing Oh
make sure it's not too hot because you
don't want to burn your eye and then you
go straight onto your lashes as you can
see I don't know if you can but that's
already curled them dramatically now
this can be quite dangerous so you need
to be really careful and make sure the
lash curler is not too hot when you
apply your false lashes use a latex free
lash glue I promise you it will change
your life the thing that people get most
pissed off of that when they apply
lashes especially if they're a beginner
is that it can stick up at the edges of
the eyes on the inner corner and they
have a corner that's because a majority
of fake eyelash glues contain latex so
if you get a latex free one it's gonna
dry faster now another thing with
eyelashes when you apply it apply with
your eye open rather than having a
closed it's going to guide you much
better and it's going to make your eye
look more open rather than closed now
this is one that can be quite
controversial I guess using a liquid
lipstick as an eye liner so if you don't
have any eyeliner or you want to change
it up into a colorful liner you can just
use a liquid lipstick all you need to do
is just use a really thin brush and
apply the liquid lipstick and done just
make sure that they are eye safe though
make sure that I save that is very
important because I don't want to be
responsible for anyone ending up in
hospital this trick will help you to
make any lipstick look matte so I'm just
going to take a regular lipstick here
this isn't a liquid lipstick so this
just dries glossy or it doesn't dry all
as I like to say and all I'm going to do
is take a tissue I'm going to take that
in half put that over the top of my lips
and then just some translucent powder
over the top now if this isn't matte
enough where you can obviously just take
translucent powder on your finger or on
a brush straight onto your lips but I
like to use it with a tissue because
otherwise it does dry up too much and
you don't want to add too much otherwise
you're going to have some crusty has
 looking ass lips on your
hand now I'm sure I'm not the only one
that does this you can actually contour
with eyeshadow I know you're thinking
what the actual that you literally
can contour with eyeshadow and I think
it's so cool because makeup is so
versatile and you can change it up
whenever you want and because
so many different eyeshadows like warm
tones and cool tones you can suit the
eyeshadow to contour your face with that
suits your skin tone
once again you can highlight with
eyeshadow as well a lot of people like
to use one called shimmer shimmer by
makeup geek to highlight their
cheekbones nose nose and all that stuff
but you can basically use any eyeshadow
that is of a high pigmentation or a low
pigmentation depends on how you like
your highlight to look and you can use
it as a highlighter so if you're not a
fan of buying highlighters and investing
in other products use one of your
 eyeshadows amazing this is a
great way to apply your liquid lipstick
to get it even just the most amazing way
to do it gives you the most perfect
guide line ever and I'm obsessed with it
basically what I'm doing is I'm starting
from the bottom of my lip and then what
I do when I do my top lip is I go into
the outer corner of my mouth open and
then just kind of fling the brush up
because this is going to give you a
great guideline from when you go down
from your Cupid's bow into the corner of
your mouth rather than trying to start
from your Cupid's bow and going down
because you've already got that natural
flick from the outer corner of your
mouth going down from the Cupid's bow
it's going to help you line it up trust
me just try it and then you'll
understand anyway guys I hope you
