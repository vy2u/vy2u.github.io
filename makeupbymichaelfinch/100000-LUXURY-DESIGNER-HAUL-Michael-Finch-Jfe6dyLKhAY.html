channel so I'm so excited for today's
video because I've weren't doing this
for so long and I asked you guys on
snapchat whether I should do it or not
this is going to be as you can tell from
the title it's going to be a luxury
designer haul now the reason why I
haven't done one of these little just
claimed you guys know exactly what I'm
gonna say is because I don't want it to
come across as like oh my god look at
all this amazing stuff I've got because
literally I do not save money
I do not save money um I love to spend
my money on
well I Drew's take my money to an extent
but like I don't it's just like my
choice where my money goes do you know
what I mean and like if people are gonna
come for me and say oh you could have
like turn into that's charity and
whatnot I always donate money to like go
fund me accounts charities and stuff I
just don't advertise it because I go off
as saying that I learned in school
called deeds not words so that pretty
much means like if you do something good
you don't have to tell everybody about
it you just do it and you feel good
yourself
which is what I've been doing and yeah
this is what I enjoy spending my money
on when I was younger I never got to you
know I would say like Kim Kardashian
with like Louis Vuitton and stuff and
I'm like holy one so bad so I
always used to go on eBay and get like
the most just like disgusting fakes
because it would make me feel good but
now the fact that I can actually buy the
real thing to me is such an achievement
and I'm so proud of myself for being
able to do this so yeah without any
further ado let's get straight into the
video I'm not gonna be showing you guys
absolutely everything that I've got
because we would be here for a while and
I don't know where everything is in my
house a lot of shits in the wash a lot
of stuff so like Shaunie's house sums in
my car and it's just all over the place
at the moment but I'm just gonna be
showing you guys like my most recent
purchases and my favorite things that I
always use on the daily so yeah let's go
now I'm sure if you guys follow me on my
other social medias especially snapchat
you would know that I'm literally
obsessed with these babies right here
these are the YSL Betty sunglasses
they're very oversized it's the only
pair that I've ever found that suits by
like big bucks head - like a good size
and they're just so big they literally
scream out like I don't know what they
scream out but they scream out a lot of
things these haven't broken like the
amount of times like I've worn these
meetups and I've gone like this and I've
hugged someone and they haven't smashed
they're very very strong so I've had
them since I went to America for the
first time which was a long time ago I
went into Chanel the other day oh my god
very materialistic I went into Chanel
the other day to try on a pair of
sunglasses that are similar to this but
they're more like circle but they're too
small for my face and I was so pissed
off because I want to change it up a
little bit but I just haven't found
anything that's as good as these and I'm
really happy with these so why fix it if
it's not broke this Hey I'm sorry if I'm
talking really fast I'm just really keen
to do this video because I put on my
snapchat and all because I put on my
snapchat and it got like 25 30 thousand
screenshots I was like screenshot I felt
me to do this sorry if you don't have me
on snapchat add me right now says okay
so moving into my most recent purchases
let me show you guys sorry these are my
new kind of like runners I wear them to
the gym I wear them just any where they
are by is livet on yeah they're just
basically like I think it's called the
monogram print so it's like got the
white the grey and then the brown and
they're just don't know where oh is that
but I know I just showed you guys those
runners oh my god these are so dirty I
wear these all the time these are do
believe it on I don't even know
what they are but they're just really
good shoes to wear to like you know
fancy little events or if I'm wearing
like a button-up shirt and I'll wear
these the bag base is super super good
to wear it like a fancy event or lucky
from going to like a boat party or
something I'll just throw these on I'm
like a Bob's your uncle says see jump
next thing is my beloved Balenciaga
shoes I love these this is probably my
favorite pair of shoes that I've ever
ever ever bought they're so
kaping they are compared to my head
they're just so comfortable and they fit
like a sock and I wear them to like the
gym I just wear them around like to the
shops I just wear them all the time and
they're just so comfortable I've also
got a great pair of these I don't really
know why I bought them but I never wear
them the black pair is like everything
and I know that just come out with like
and neon like yellow pair and they've
come out with like a dark blue pair with
like red and white on them but they ugly
I don't like them so the gun now the
question I get when I always talk about
design of stuff is my what is my most
busiest thing that I've ever bought that
would have to be this Katya bracelet
it's just like everything like I'm never
taking it off it's so beautiful
like I don't even know I just wanted it
for so long for so long and I finally
got it I'm so proud of myself for
getting it and yeah I'm literally
obsessed oh another thing that I've been
loving these are the is Yvonne she Javan
she we say Javan she here in Australia
not as yawning I always go Jevon she
Siobhan she might in the store when I'm
in there Javad chi oi
Siobhan Qi cha anyway these are their
new season slides they're just really
really gorge the only thing I don't like
about them is that the pot at the front
is kind of like harsh and it kind of
cuts into your foot so that's not old ah
cry about these but they're still cute
to wear and I still wear them
occasionally you just can't wear them
for long periods of time unless you have
band-aids or levee ties which I believe
is sorry that's them these
literally have dust on them these are
from their new season as well these are
the age of when she Paris and neon pink
slides to be honest I don't even know
why I bought them I thought that was
cute at the time and now I just regret
up certain I might be giving them to my
eyeshadow no I'm gonna get these too
because no one has my foot size like in
my friend grave ha ba ba I bought these
ones last week and I'm actually obsessed
I think I got to wear them once but
these are the Javan Chi Chi Vaughn she
kicks these are from their new season as
well they're just like a black shoe with
like a platform that made me look so
much taller than I already am and they
just have the massive big fuck-off Javan
Chi parasite on the front just to let
everybody know that there's your fun
shoe you know what I'm saying
now I also bought this luck last week
because I feel like it's gonna be very
now another one of my recent purchases
that I bought last week actually Pacific
that in the golf cart this is the Gucci
as Australians like to call it fanny
pack so I bought this because it's gonna
be really good for like Coachella and
I'm going to Bali in a few weeks or I
feel like I don't want people that
coming up behind me and trying to take
my out of my pockets like peek pop
it is and I don't want like you know
just people trying to steal my so
the way I'm gonna wear it it's like
don't judge me but try go like this and
then if I go I gotta wear it like this
I'm like a gorge spider or something
like not wearing this shirt obviously
because it just doesn't work look so bad
no I wouldn't wear like a fanny pack a
society pack or anything like that but
it's Gucci so it's okay for me to wear
it
well I sound like such a materialistic
asshole but I am and I love it
or maybe I'll wear like this or maybe I
won't might wear around my waist is like
an actual fanny pack but like to the
side a little bit more anyway oh
and it's like really good leather I
think I don't know I was talking to the
chief of story about it and she was so
nice that you get the Gucci store oh my
gosh I forget a name but um we had like
mad chats about like the guy who like
creates Gucci and all that stuff and she
gave me this book for my coffee table
which I don't even have yet because I
don't have room in this small little
apartment someone I move our coffee
table is a main priority so I can put
this one on there and then misty no one
that I got at the New York City store
this is like stunning like look at the
pages in this it's like so Gorge
I literally just wanna get another one
so I can rip out all the pages and put
them into frames and put them all around
my house that's how stunning they are
and then even in the back it's got Gucci
stickers like I'm sorry good she
dick assist right up my asshole I love
it this is really classified as designer
as sorry but um this is my favorite
perfume of all time this is the Tom
through Tom Ford dude would you guys I
got this when I was in Hong Kong and I
just ran out of it so I went and bought
this one at PAX there the other day holy
 it smells so good if you want a
bougie gift trade for your dad or your
boyfriend or just anyone this is where
it's at and it lasts well on your skin -
it's like an
like oil so it doesn't come off your
enemy like two sprays but of course I
use like ten because I just like to be
over the top and it's amazing
yeah another two of my favorite things
these are true about these are both from
Gucci this one was actually bought for
me from Ronnie and Lily for my birthday
I love this because when you're wearing
Lac all dark colors you can dress it up
with a little bit of red and color with
the navy blue and the red and there's
silver so that's like a statement piece
so I really like that and then also this
one I bought ages ago I think I
bought this when I was in the Singapore
Airport like Singapore I don't know
Malaysia no I haven't beaten I don't
know anyway I bought this and it's just
like the gold tiger head and the classic
red and green about part another my true
favorite things that I always wear this
is the Givenchy Givenchy this is the
Givenchy Paris cap and this one is from
d'squared true I think that's how you
say it just says icon on it because I'm
just I con living oh oh I actually
bought this a few weeks ago as well this
is the Balenciaga pouch I just bought
this for when I go for coffee or
something I can just put all my in
it or when I go out clubbing it's not
very beneficial because it doesn't
really have like a strap or anything
it's just kind of got well this is a
strap but like it's like I can't like go
around my arm or anything like that so
you kind of got to hold it so I just
stick it under my arm on this thing and
I also wear these all the time these are
one of my favorites these are the Louis
Vuitton slides from there I think that
second latest season I'm actually not
sure I don't really know how it all
works I just kind of see new season I
think wow and you season yes I wear
these quite a lot as well this is be a
Gucci red backpack that I've been loving
for so long I don't really get a chance
to wear it but I feel like it's gonna be
good for I don't know where can I wear
this I just don't really wear backpacks
because I make my back like really
sweaty last but not least I'm just gonna
quickly show you guys some of my
favorite shirts that I've bought now a
lot of them are in the wash because
they're dirty and I'm a pig and I
haven't washed them that's so there's
quite a few in the wash that I have not
got in this pile and also I lost my
Gucci shirt and also my Balenciaga merch
I'm pretty sure I left it in the bottom
in the Maldives because I haven't seen
it for so long and yeah sorry they're
gone okay so some of my favorite shirts
this one is from Louis Vuitton it's like
a red obviously it's a red not
pink mate is this just like a red shirt
it's got like texture to it it just says
I don't even know I think it says rum it
says Louis Vuitton parries I don't
really know it's just really cute I wore
this to my Sydney master class I think
the next one I want to show you guys
this is like they're just the classic
Javan she like just stress t-shirt I
love this so much I actually just bought
one of their other ones from menu season
it's got like to read it looks like two
red hearts on it but it's like like an
action or like a love heart it's like an
actual heart it does look like to read
things that's also dirty as in the
wash as well I love to wear like
oversized t-shirt so I love boremont
does one size fits all like oversized
t-shirt so this is one of them I just
love the pattern it's so different and
like I don't know I just really like it
not too much too long this is a Versace
one that I bought ages ago but I don't
and I can't wear it because it's too
small for me so I have to keep losing
weight
obviously not just to fit into a
Versace t-shirt but I need to keep
losing weight because I feel so much
better the more weight I'm losing so um
this is stunning I love this so much I
can't wait to wear that one day with
like a pair of white jeans and like
those Versace high tops that I've got
but I also wear I wore them clubbing on
Sunday night and there is black all
over them so I have to get them cleaned
next thing is just the classic boom on
Patti
black t-shirt just you know just
casually now I always wear these
t-shirts this is from a brand called
off-white I just love their
shirts they're they're lit and the fit
of them is so cool and they're so
different like it says on the bottom I
was just thinking I was just thinking
thinking about work dick okay clucks
here is another off white shirt that I
love it's just like so simple but like
you can just dress it up or dress it
down you vibe now this one I always wear
all the time this is from a discount
universe it's actually the coolest shirt
ever what is to splendor last year and
it's still one of my favorite shirts
this shirt is like such a piece this is
by Givenchy and it's got like
Jools on the side it's just literally a
plain black t-shirt with these like
crystals on the side literally obsessed
love wearing that to select Deena or
like something cute when I don't want to
wear a button up or like a Tommy
Hilfiger or like a Ralph Lauren gel and
this shirt is by machinery I picked this
up when I was in New York City it's just
so good to wear around I don't know I
just really like the fit of it and last
but not least I'm just gonna show you
guys this shirt here from st. Lebrun
this is just a classic largo
shirt on it alright anyway I hope you
