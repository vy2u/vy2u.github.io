today I'm gonna be doing a makeup
tutorial using like a festival makeup
tutorial using super super SuperDuper
affordable products I've got them here
in front of me from bu is designer
brands essence mud makeup which you
combine Woolworths
Astralis model Co BH Cosmetics model
rock lashes so super super affordable
brands if you've been watching me for a
while now you know that I love drugstore
as much as I love high-end product
sometimes with high-end products I do
believe you are just paying for the name
that is slapped on top of it but yeah if
you haven't already make sure you follow
me on snapchat twitter and instagram i'm
come and follow me on Twitter because I
always talk to everybody on Twitter I
will leave them all on the screen now
and down below as well and without any
further ado let's get straight into the
video ok so getting started I'm gonna be
starting off with my brows first and for
that I'm going to be using I'm gonna be
using the Raa a brow brow shaping kit
from Australis and I am gonna be using
all affordable brushes as well as makeup
as well so I leave all the brushes that
I'm using on the screen somewhere around
here so the brush that I'm using first
is the BH Cosmetics number 12 now I'm
gonna take some of this a gel part here
just to create some shape because I need
to extend the end of my brow so they're
not as short I'm just kind of brushing
this through and kind of creating like
an e shape underneath I'm kind of just
bringing it down the front and then what
I like to do is I just kind of flick up
of what's left on the brush kind of just
to create like little fake hairs not do
they look anything like it but doing
this just allows you to get like the
right effect to the front of your brow
to fill it in without being too
overpowering now just taking the same
brush and was going to take some of this
darker shade and I'm just going to kind
of run through everything and more sorry
just feeling all the little gaps and
this is just all start going to set the
jelly you've just put down beforehand
and now just taking a little bit of a
lot of shade I'm just gonna pop that at
the front of my brown and kind of just
flick up again sorry now to conceal
these brows and clean them up a little
bit I'm just gonna be taking the la girl
Pro concealer this is in the shade
porcelain and I'm gonna be taking this
on the BH Cosmetics number 9 brush so
I'm just gonna squirt a little bit out
onto the back of my hand because don't
make the mistake that I always do and
squirt it right onto my eye because last
time I did that I just got it underneath
it went straight into my eye and I was
crying for hours so Janet M would not
recommend now I'm just gonna use this to
carve out the brow more sorry no I'm
just gonna pull this concealer down okay
and we're worried about concealing the
top of the brow later when we do
foundation cuz I like to conceal the
tops of my brows with foundation just so
all matches and it's not like beaming or
anything like that I'm just gonna take
this concealer all over my lid because
we're gonna be using a base today now
this is very important because if you
want your shadows to show up and stay on
then make sure you either use an eye
base or a concealer I honestly feel like
you can use any concealer for your eye
base as long as you set it properly I
always use the top shape take that
that's not very realistic to talk about
in this video because it is an
affordable drugstore video so let's not
talk about heart shape shape doesn't
have to be perfect because we're
literally about to blend it out alright
then I'm just gonna be taking this satin
baffi a beauty sponge and I'm just going
to blend this all in okay forgetting how
good of coverage this concealer gives
and it's literally only like doing like
six and ten dollars I think if you're in
Australia and don't feel obliged to
bring it all the way under here that's
just my cheeks popping out and getting
in the way now we need to set that to
keep it in place I'm just gonna be
taking the BH Cosmetics and brush the
number four and a little bit of the
Rimmel stay matte powder I'm just gonna
pop a little bit of that over the lid
just to set that concealer so it doesn't
move and crease and be all nasty now for
my eyeshadow today I'm gonna be trying
out this BH Cosmetics modern Maps 28
color eyeshadow palette so there's some
beautiful colors in here are super
versatile and I think today I want to go
with like the purple
pinky sort of I look with some glitter
that I've got er all right so the first
color I'm gonna take is this light pink
shade and I'm taking this on the
Platinum contour I brush this mirror
doing it needs to just relax because
I've had enough and I'm gonna start by
putting this into my crease and kind of
just like blending up I'm gonna zoom you
guys in because I know you can see but I
want to do that oh my god the mirror
almost fucking fell on my teeth Wow
sorry about that I'm just gonna keep
blending this a lot pink shadow through
the crease just to kind of give a little
bit of color to use the trends Deshawn
you know now taking this other pink
shade I'm taking this undie bh cosmetics
brush number six then I was going to
take that brush I was using before and
moreso blend out that pinky shade then
I'm gonna go in with a little bit of the
purple shade that's just next to it and
I'm gonna start building at these two up
in my crease these shadows aren't old
that pigmented but they are blending out
really nicely so it's kind of just like
a light wash of collagen I'm saying
alright so I'm just gonna go in with the
darker purple and I'm just going to pop
that on the outer V and just sit there
kind of blend it up through my crease
Roger the judge uh Roger bags and I'm
just gonna take some what pink and pop
it over the edge of I've just put two
purple and blend it out so I'm just
taking a clean a blending brush and I'm
just blending out all the pink and I'm
just taking a little bit more of the
purple and just kind of deepening
everything a little bit more then I
wasn't taking a little bit of that dark
shade next to the purple and kind of
just pick that on ever-so-slightly I
don't want to turn this into like a
crazy crazy
full glam intense look
okay guys sorry continuing on I've just
done this i off-camera but I'm gonna
show you how I did that right now so
we're gonna kind of be doing a little
bit of a cut crease and for that you're
gonna need some glitter glue now I don't
have a drugstore affordable glitter glue
I've only got the two-faced one I know
Nick starts to do one though I do need
to get my hands on that for videos just
like this and then I'm gonna be mixing
it with the astrology myrrh pot this is
in the shade nearly naked stunning let's
pretend that I'm using an affordable
glue and we're just gonna completely
skip that just gonna squat some of that
glue on to the back of my hand and then
I'm just gonna going with these little
baby brush here this is from BH
Cosmetics number 11 and then I'm just
gonna do like a little bit of a cut
crease you know what I mean
and when I get to the edges I'm just
gonna like dab a little bit in with the
shimmer pot from aster Alice and I'm
just gonna use this as a base for the
glitter that we're about to put over the
top and then when I get close to the
outer V I'm just gonna Pat and kind of
just like slightly blend the shimmer put
into it okay once we've got that down a
medicine take a little bit more glitter
glue and I'm just gonna go straight over
the top of that we just kind of use the
shimmer pot as a base for the glitter so
it's not like translucent underneath now
going in with this BH Cosmetics and
glitter this is in the shade Elliott's
Singh I don't know how to say that so
I'll just leave it on the screen now
because it is a festival it is not an
option to not have winged liner so I'm
just going to be taking the astrologer
ophea eyeliner pen and I'm just gonna go
ahead and do a bit of a big fuck-off
wing
who I can breathe again oh my god doing
wing lineup stresses me out especially
when there's glitter on my eyelid anyway
moving on to mascara I'm just gonna be
taking the essence instant volume boost
mascara and I'm just going to generously
apply this to my lids lashes Wow Oh for
my lashes today I'm just gonna be taking
these lashes by model rock lashes these
are in the style Melrose so I've just
popped on a little bit of lash glue I'm
just gonna let this dry for around 30
seconds and then just pop it straight on
holy shit they look so good Wow pinching
these together just with these lush
tweezers they blend with my natural ones
oh my god they look so let okay so now
that my eyes are finally done let's move
on to the face so for primer I'm gonna
be using the face based skin primer from
model Co and I'm just gonna take a
little bit of that it's like a clear
sort of consistency and for a puppet or
face there was actually glitter all over
my face like I don't get off that's just
part of doing your makeup when you use
glitter literally just goes everywhere
and you never see the end of it for the
next six months for my foundation today
I'm gonna be using this one from a
designer brands this is the luminous
hydrating foundation this is in the
shade classic ivory 8:02 now I have used
this before and it has incredible
coverage and nice and glowy
so I'm just gonna use this foundation
brush from tbx of beauty and I'm just
going to kind of dot this around my face
as well and then it's gonna take my
morphe Beauty sponge again and then go
to town and start blending all this out
oh I have a blind pimple above my lip
and it fucking hurts so I'm just
blending this all in a blends in super
super well and it kind of looks natural
in a way but you can build it up and get
like a really really really sick epic
coverage sick epic coverage Wow cool
dude so I'm just going in with my second
layer now ah you don't have to do a
second layer like this like you can put
more on at the stop but I just like to
build it up and guard from there you
know now I'm just gonna conceal the tops
of my brows okay like to me that just
looks like real skin tonight what you
think bout now just taking some more of
the LA girl Pro concealer I'm just gonna
square that onto the back of my heart
and then I'm just gonna do the typical
areas of highlighting gonna go straight
looking with my damp morphe sponge and
blend all this out blending blending
blending
yeah I love this blending got my arm
feeling like it's about to fucking fall
off because I've had enough
okay I'm going straight up old hand

out and there's some Agarn with my
Maybelline fit me setting powder in the
shade fair Clair most are taking this
powder all over my NARS I'm like my
cheeky little squats yeah and I'm gonna
be baking at my forehead a little bit as
well just to set that concealer because
the a Lego parking so is quite thick so
I feel like you need quite a bit of
consumer to Bank it into planks gel and
then my smile lines now what I'm gonna
do is just take this big fuck-off a
fluffy a brush from platinum powder
brush and I'm just gonna take that
translucent powder and set everything on

a festival every fucking day to be
honest now to contour my face a little
bit I'm just gonna be taking the mud

pretty sure I tried it out ages ago and
I was literally obsessed with it I think
it's so good and for the price phenom
I'm just gonna going with a little bit
of this shade and a little bit of this
shade top it all off and then just going
on in here
this stuff is sorry pigmented and it
does create like a big like line on your
face but it's sorry blendable so you can
place it where you want it and then kind
of like blend it out straight afterwards

as well and kind of just buff that in
we're gonna do like Diaz and then you
put it on your face luckiest luckiest
she got a neck Hey country my line is so
important oh my god I can't stress it
