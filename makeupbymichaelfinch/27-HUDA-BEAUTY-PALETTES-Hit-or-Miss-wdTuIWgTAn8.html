channel so today I'm going to be
reviewing these two huda beauty
I should have pellets that I've got so I
put the warm Browns obsessions and also
the electric obsessions so these are
really pretty the warm Brown obsessions
has like nice you know transition shades
in it like berry colors pretty cute and
then in the electric one we have a bunch
of like really crazy colors like I
almost like a red a pink and neon orange
Purple's blues yellows greens I love
them all um so today I'm going to be
putting these to the test to see if they
work these retail for twenty seven
dollars each 27 US dollars I'll leave
the Australian amount on the screen
right now but she has come out with four
I've only got two these were sent to me
in PR from who to beauty I'm just gonna
put that out there shout out to them
because they're still sending me stuff
after I gave them a really bad review on
the desert dust palette so yeah sorry
I've already prepped my eyes with a
little bit of touch tape tape and I've
just said it with a tiny bit of fresh
and flawless powder from Australis and
now we're gonna go straight in and see
what we can do okay now that I've put
you guys nice and closed let's get
started so I think I'm gonna do the warm
brown obsessions on this eye right here
and then I'm gonna do the electric one
on this side just what I have to put
into two videos and make you guys wait
for the next one so I'm firstly gonna
take this light brown shade just on my
blending brush and this is the x-ray
Beauty eyeshadow blender brush and I'm
just gonna pop this into my crease
okay we're off to a really good start
you guys it would make me really happy
if I liked these eyeshadows because the
desert dust palette was just bad for me
so we're gonna give this a well okay
that's blending really good so far just
gonna pick up a bit more on the brush
and just go through and kind of blend it
onto my inner corner that's what I'll do
this is blended really nicely so far so
good but who knows what's gonna happen
I'm just gonna take a little bit more of
this shade and just intensify it a
little bit more especially in the inner
corner here the next shade I'm gonna
pick up is like this orange sorry like
this reddish sort of shade I think red
eye shadows or like almost run a shadows
are really hard to make so let's see how
this goes all right so this is nowhere
near as pigmented as the first one I'm
loading up my brush tapping off the
share okay
so there's this this color is not
performing as well as the one before it
looks really pigmented in the palette
but when you put it on the eye it's not
that pigmented just gonna blend that out
I don't want to say that I don't like it
quiet just yet
so instead I'm just gonna move on to
this maroon burgundy sort of color and
I'm just gonna pop this straight on to
be out of thee
that was RK I'm just gonna blend out the
edge it's gonna take some more of that
maroon shade and I really want this to
deep and up my crease but it's not
really letting me do that I mean this
doesn't look bad the eyeshadows are just
very like faint when you put them on top
of each other which is generally what
you meant to do and with an eyeshadow
palette all right so I'm just gonna try
taking some of this like dark purplish
shade along with this other shade and
I'm gonna take this on my XO Beauty
small blender brush and I'm gonna see if
I can put this into the outer V to give
some sort of dimension to this eyeshadow
so it did something gonna try packing
them more and I'm going to take the
brush that I used before
and just kind of tap over the edges but
as soon as you put another eyeshadow
over the top of the one that you put
down before especially with this like
darker like purpley sort of tone it
literally disappears into nothing which
I'm so confused about because I'm
working with the eyeshadows like I work
with any other palette all right so next
one's gonna take the gold shade that
smack BAM in the middle and I'm just
gonna try applying this or with a brush
yeah I came now just gonna spray my
brush with a bit of fix+ and then go
into the shadow
fix+ fixes everything
so I'm just gonna pop this gold onto
like my lid area now I'm done taking a
little bit more of those two purpley
dark tone shades that I used before and
I'm gonna pop it in the outer V and kind
of just on to the corner of the lid
where the gold is just keeps blending
away like I'm putting some on blending
around the edge and kind of just on the
edge of that gold as you can see we've
gotten quite a bit of Fallout okay so
now we're gonna test out the electric
palette on the other side first I'm just
gonna take the yellow that's in the
middle and I'm just gonna pop that into
my crease that's pretty pigmented for a
yellow and I'm just gonna blend that up
into whatever I'm st. and I'm
just gonna bring that into my inner
corner yeah I'm just gonna blend that
out just to make sure it's alright now
that I've got my yellow down I'm gonna
jump in with the same brush that I used
with the yellow and I'm gonna go into
like this vibrant neon shade I don't
really know what to call I've never
really seen an eye should I like this
but I'm gonna put this into my crease or
am i okay so this color is choosing not
to show up much at all but I'm just
gonna sit here and play with that for a
little bit before I definitely decide
that I don't like it okay so it's
showing up not too badly to be honest
I'm just gonna blend it into my inner
corner again like I did on the other
side
I feel like with here as eyeshadows now
like the rose gold palette you didn't
have to take your time and be careful
but now with her eye shadows I'm pretty
sure well the formula definitely has
changed you've got to like take more
time and like just be more gentle and
you use her shadows because the formulas
completely changed I'm just going to
take a bit more of that yellow and kind
of just press it over the edge just
lightly so like a blend the two together
but so the next shade I'm gonna take is
this super hot pink shade just on the
same brush that I used before and I'm
gonna pack this on Wow okay well you
need to take a step back instead of
using a blending brush to pack this
shadow and let's try a different way I'm
going to take it's gonna take this small
little definer brush here and I'm gonna
take the pink and I'm gonna try and oh
my god it literally doesn't make a
difference I was gonna pop this pink all
up through the crease no this
pinkish sorry chalky oh my god like it
looks so good on the brush and in the
pan but like I'm just trying to build up
this pink color yeah any place that's
showing pigment as a fallout underneath
my eyes I think this is good as we're
gonna get for the pink eyeshadow but I'm
just gonna take my makeup wipe and clean
up all right so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna go in with the reddish sort of
shade this looks pretty cool I feel like
this is gonna be a good color and I'm
gonna pop this onto the outer V and try
and use this two more so deep and up at
the crease so I'm gonna Pat this shadow
on before I blend it
I'm like packing it on and the pigment
just like it disappears as soon as I
blend around or something I'm gonna try
taking it on this big fluffy brush and
that keeps wood shut it's like showing
up and working to an extent but like
you've really got to pack it on just
gonna take some more of that yellow and
just kind of go over the edges we've
completely lost that neon color by the
way it's just off completely
didn't want to stick around and stay for
the party all right so I'm just gonna
spritz my brush with a little bit of
fix+ or a lot and then I'm just gonna
dip straight into that light blue
turquoise he looking shadow it's just so
Gorge and I'm gonna pack this on my lid
okay now this is good this shutter is
pigmented so I love this electric eye
shadow palette everything like all the
colors in it is very pretty but it's
just a shame they're not how I'd like
them to be now this is probably gonna
 the whole look up but I just want
to try I want to take the darkest green
blue eyeshadow that's in this palette
and I wanted to see if I can blend out
this um look it's a look that I've got
going on up here so I'm just gonna take
a little blender brush and I'm gonna I'm
actually gonna pop it onto the outer V
of my eye
probably gonna turn to pink purple to be
honest
okay so I was right about this doc ish
and blue eye shadow hunting purple
that's just common knowledge you know
when it comes to the color whale hunt so
I'm not really sure if it's meant to be
a blue or a green or a purple but this
is just turning into like a bit of a
 show still looks pretty cold I'm
not gonna lie blending in this blue
color to like the orange it's turning it
into an eye like a nice transition II
sort of shade or am I just thinking it
looks good is it just a mess cuz I feel
bad for myself
okay so I've managed to blend out this
blue shadow to an extent we shouldn't
have to play with eyeshadow to get it to
work how it should be working do you
know what I mean like well anyway I'm
gonna go back in with the neon like sort
of orange color and I'm gonna see if I
can bring that back in the crease I
really want to I love to kind of you
know work out a bit although it's
looking hella patchy in some places the
Pink's completely gone come at pal
lately off which I literally knew
that was gonna happen as soon as I put
down to greeny blue collar and then I'm
just gonna pack on some more of that
greeny blue color and as soon as you lay
this color down you cannot touch it
again you cannot try and blend it out
cuz it'll literally just disappear so
it's gotta be the last thing that you
put on then I'm just gonna take that
turquoise sea blue again and I'm just
gonna pop a little bit more on my lid
make it a little bit more alright so I'm
pretty sure this is as good as we're
going to get okay you guys so these are
the final looks I've just popped some
mascara on and some lashes okay so now
for my final thought so first of all
let's start off with the warm Brown
obsessions palette sorry it's a gorge
palette the brown shade really works for
me the orange shade really works for me
this one was okay this one was fine this
one I didn't really touch much this one
didn't work like at all and these two
didn't really work for me at all I
wanted to add definition with these two
but it just wouldn't let me do it and
the Goblin is really really pretty so
the gold one is the shimmery one in the
middle and that worked out really well
on my lid
I could even add more right now if I
wanted to to like build out pigment is
this worth buying I would say if I was
you I would go out and get it if you
enjoy a light wash of shadows but if you
like something full glam that you can
pack on and build up and all that sort
of then probably not but who knows
just because it didn't work out that
well for me it could still work for you
now for the electric obsessions palette
so I'm just gonna say that I love the
colors in this palette they're
John okay sorry this shade was actually
really pretty in the end it worked out
really pigmented and helped me kind of
blend the situation I've got going on
here and this blue shade right here 100%
recommend it's so pretty
the purple shades I didn't really try it
but they are the shimmery shades and
just watching them like they look pretty
good they look pretty good
so these two purple shades yeah they're
cool so I would say they would work
there's no really questions about it
it's more matte colors that you have
trouble with in eyeshadow palettes um
this color wasn't all that bad it was
just like a light wash a purple and then
I tried to add some of the pink and it
didn't work and then I tried to add some
of this and it kind of just turned it
into a bit of a show but I don't
really mind it we kind of lost the
orange neon transition up here ages ago
but now do I think this palette is worth
it I would say yes to be honest like
it's not that bad of a palette and the
only thing that I didn't really like
about it was the fact that like when you
try and layer up the shadows I don't
work too well so you have to kind of
stick to using one or two shadows rather
than like three or four but the shimmery
shades in here like this one is really
nice like it's proven on my eyelid and
yeah I don't know the yellow is
pigmented the neon one you could have to
like you just had to build the neon one
up these two aren't the greatest so
overall I might have to have a bit of a
a bit more of a play with these in some
videos just to like warm up to them but
they're a lot better than the desert
dust palette that's what I'm gonna say
hey so yeah anyway I hope you guys
really enjoyed this video and you learnt
something new today if you enjoyed it
please make sure you give it a massive
thumbs up I love you guys and I will see
you all in my next video see
