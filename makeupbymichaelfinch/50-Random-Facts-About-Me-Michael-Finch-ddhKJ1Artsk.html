temper super easily I have anxiety Kim
and Khloe Kardashian and my ultimate
client goals I literally cannot function
without acrylic nails who else is like
that I only ever wear liquid lipsticks
the reason why I don't wear other
lipsticks is because it transfers down
because my lips Toby in his mature makes
a mark another I hate sex

hair color was actually strawberry
