ensemble that I put together the other
day when I was at the plant no three

like a little stand three real plants
and some fake in there to make it
more like butch I think that was the
right word I'm gonna ask the pot this
water lily no it's not a water lily
should be in water sister Lily
it reminds me of Lily also we have some
flowers that I was given from the lush
lily in Kendall I think this John mean

like three days so they're looking a
little bit but they still looking good

these in there all the time I'm pretty
sure start I I also bought a
mini trade bonsai wank and last
night when I went to South node I picked
up two bags of flamin hot cheetos ten
Australian dollars these only two
dollars in America but I guess it's like
you got to get it over here and it's
just like dramatic and it's just
completely shocked by the way I bought
this lip balm the other day from Chanel
it was like 65 $70 I know about that I
feel like this I'm wearing this shirt
from saintly journal and it's dumb
little bitch put a tissue in the wash
the other day so it's literally all over
me sir

literally a life savers they're like
these sticky things oh my god they're so
good you just go like this and then it's
literally just off to shoot okay

in this day and age in Brisbane at this
time of the morning

starving
I am and I'm pretty sure
and I always go out to drink
I got a green juice kind of coffee any
dad okay so this is what I got it's
smashed a bar with bacon and eggs and a
green and a coffee that was literally
the best thing I've ever had in my life
but you know what I find really annoying
is when you like you're having like a
really lit day like a really good day
and then you get a text message and it's
just like it just ruins your day like
wad and post and all like one little
message can just like ruin your whole
entire day anyway I'm gonna try and not
think about it because I want this vlog
to be fun not a sad depressing
of a thing
Lilly taught me how to park originally
just pretend like you get a pop you
don't sweat around
right sir I finished vacuuming and now
I'm going to an appointment to get some
LED treatments on my skin I want to get
my Bartok star bot devil got today rock
hard but I'm so we got a treatment for

other day and literally went on someone
else about me and I put my head down and
I was like I'm sorry sorry is you think
you're okay and I'm like I hope my god
if I wasn't there to say sorry then she
probably would have sent in a complaint
and I probably would have been kicked
out of mana my apartment which probably
would have been a blessing in disguise
because I'm over the rug works
and they're building apartments
6:30 a.m. every morning bindi

green light the purple light and the
yellow light going so how you feeling
I'm good like hot each different life in
a gross way like it's really warm a
quiet yeah just reaching the different
levels of the skin so the purple with a
little bit warmer so what it's doing is
it's gonna help to energize the skin
give you a really nice glow reduce any
redness but also help to get rid of any
waste that's inside the skin so all the
things that are in the skin that we
don't want it'll help to activate the
base production and get rid of all those
