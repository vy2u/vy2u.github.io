a problem that cut out my box okay let's
go to the top so we have like 700
comments and we have a lot of different
questions so the first question is that
you want to get married and have kids
100% I don't really think I need to get
married as such but I would love to have
kids on day I love a little boy and a
little girl or two boys and two girls or
three girls and three I don't know I
don't know what's going to happen in the
future but I feel like I love kind of
having responsibilities and I know if I
have kids
I'll be like the best dad that I can be
for them I don't know I just I just
really want kids
I'll get them one day I don't know how
it all works but imma get kids one day
I'ma be add a girl imma send my kids off
to school and they like BH if you get
bullied
i'ma coming with the kids as air and
that is bullying you do not I mean like
I'll be such a defensive dad and like
I've learned to let my kids put up with
anyone so yeah how excited I use
for the mail we made out dude I'm so
freaking excited I've been talking about
it in every single video as you guys
know I'm doing a mouth made up on August
5th in melbourne melbourne central with
sephora if you are ran in the area come
see me more details about that will be
linked down below
someone said losing weight and your
journey so losing weight for me so far
has been life-changing ly really really
good I don't really do like scales I
don't really believe in scales I don't
like the numbers that come up and like
for example the reason why I don't do
scales is like a long time ago when I
started to lose weight
I would weigh myself and then I'd become
obsessed with them or I'd weigh myself
at home and I'd be this number and then
I would go and weigh myself at a
friend's house and it would be higher so
scales it just really depends on like
where you are going to flat ground like
and if you weigh yourself at home in
your this way and then you go to
somebody else's house or use someone
else's scales or something and it's
higher than the you know you can do it
on the same day that it was at home it's
really like disappointing and it's
really unmotivated also I don't really
do scales but when I did weigh myself I
did weigh myself before I started losing
weight and I think I've lost around 13
to 14 kilos which is so so so good I'm
really happy at the pace I've been
losing weight at I don't think he needs
to lose weight fast as such I've just
been doing it myself I haven't been
really exercising I've been to the gym
once in this whole journey as such I've
been to the gym once and I was for only
20 minutes I was on the treadmill for 15
minutes and then I was on this biking
for 15 and my legs were killing me by
the end of it I'm so unfit but I really
do wanted to get into gym because I
really want to be super like buff you
know what I mean so I want to have like
big fuck-off muscles and but maybe
one day you know I'll get there one day
if you're trying to lose weight go you
you can do it I have tried so much in my
life to lose weight and I just got so I
motivated because I didn't see results
but this time like it's a lifestyle
change like I'm just so used on not
eating junk food and I don't ever want
to go back to how big I was like I look
back at old photos and I'm like oh my
god that actually looks so unhealthy so
I'm yeah I'm not going to stop until I
have abs in a v-line that's my goal and
big fuck-off muscles so I'm just going
to keep going it might take a year it
might take two years might take three
years I don't know but I'm never going
to stop because if I stop I'll be so
depressed I don't know that for a fact
because when I eat junk food now I
genuinely feel upset and depressed and I
just you know I just hate myself after
doing it so I just can't do it anymore
like occasionally if I'm drunk
I'll have McDonald's like the other
night another question that I just saw
in my snapchat was what do you order
McDonald's bitch I get a double
cheeseburger meal with bacon I get three
large fries and a sprite or a coke the
next question is do you have a boyfriend
and do you want if not do you want a
boyfriend no I don't have a boyfriend
and I've never
had a boyfriend in my actual life um
this is like a weird topic to talk about
because I don't really talk about this
stuff on my channel but I'm going to
talk about it because it's highly
requested in all these questions so I
don't have a boyfriend because like I
don't know I don't really oh my god why
am I getting upset what the
this is slower stop oh the reason why I
don't have a boyfriend is because I've
had really bad I don't know I just feel
like I'm not good enough to anyone like
I just look at myself and I'm like
you're like that and like you're gross
like I have like really bad like
self-esteem issues when it comes to like
my image and I just think who wants a
day made you know what I mean but
everyone's like no you need to get past
that like that's not how it is like I
felt like that I felt like that before
um but like it's just hard like it's I
don't know I just feel like like I'm not
good enough to be anyone's boyfriend
tonight I mean but like I would love a
boyfriend I would treat him like an
elector literal prince like I would do
like I don't know oh my god I can't
leave I just go upset what the I
think you cuz I've ever spoken about
this on my channel before so it's kind
of weird for me but yeah I don't have a
boyfriend I would love her boyfriend it
would be sick it'd be so good to have
someone like cuz I live by myself I get
lonely as and when I get lonely I
get so anxious and I have the worst
anxiety that's why there's always people
over at my house but I'm the reason why
I'm losing weight as well is because I
want to improve my body image as well
I'm not doing it to get a boyfriend but
I'll feel better in myself because I
constantly have that thought in the back
of my head that's like you're not good
enough to anyone like no one's gonna
like you if you're like an overweight
Bush pig do not I mean haha anyway I'm
moving on next question oh my god all
these questions are literally are you
dating anyone another question that I
get asked a lot is how much do you get
paid
okay so legally guys I'm not allowed to
tell you how much I get paid or like
anything like that because it's all in a
lot of contracts and stuff like that but
I don't know how to say this without
like getting in trouble for it
so basically I'll just quickly talk
about it so there's Adsense which is
like Google
so when you see an ad at the front of
the video you basically get pasted and
all adds up and you get paid once a
month I'm obviously not allowed to
disclose that amount to anyone ever
because it's literally so illegal in the
YouTube community it doesn't allow to do
it but I'm sorry that there is a brand
sponsorship so sponsored videos and
stuff like that
you guys know I'm super open about all
my sponsorship videos I always let you
guys know if a video is sponsored and if
it's in the contract that I'm not
allowed to say that it's sponsored at
the start of the video I'll leave it
down below and that's one rule that I
have with every brand that I work with I
make sure that I'm allowed to say in the
video that it is sponsored at the
beginning and if not I have to leave it
down below and if they say no you know
lastly well then I don't work with them
because I'm so open about my
sponsorships and I never want to hide
them from you guys I never have and I
never will I always give you guys my
honest opinion on the product regardless
of what the rate is like what they're
offering to pay me like they could be
offering to pay me $20,000 and if it's a
ship product and they say that I'm gonna
letter say that it's sponsored then I'll
reject it I probably reject 90% of
sponsorships that I get so you guys only
see the best of the best and products
that I truly believe in here's a good
question what is something that you
would say to your childhood self I would
say to my childhood self what other
people say what other people think
I feel like a lot of my friends and
stuff that are you know youtubers that
have like pretty much made it on YouTube
if that's what you call it
we're bullied in school and I feel like
if you're bullied in school you're going
to make it somewhere big in life so if
you're bullied in school and you have a
dream go for it because literally sorry
many people I know who were bullied in
school make it somewhere in life and
then everyone who bullied them in school
tries to suck up their ass and be their
friend when they're older and they're
successful because that's what happens
to me so yeah what is your favorite
highlighter ever now if you guys been
watching my channel for quite a long
time you would know that Oprah
highlighters are legit my favorite
highlighters ever I'm obsessed with them
they are so good they're creamy they're
blendable they're buildable and they're
literally blinding I'm not wearing it
now but normally I am always wearing
Oprah hi
that's what I tried to change it up you
know if you had to ever get a dog what
we do name it I was actually discussing
this with my friend before I would
probably call it either Gucci or lui
Gucci or Louie I know SOI materialistic
but like Gucci Oh Louie the next
question is about your dad you don't
really talk much about him okay so with
my dad it's like oh my god all these
questions I like really hitting home
today like what I thought I'm with my
dad it's like oh my god I'm not getting
upset again what the is going on so
my dad pretty much like he loves me and
I love him so much but he's never really
been super supportive of me I don't want
to like - my dad in the video because I
do love him a lot and he does so much
for me he helps me with so much stuff
but I'm just going to say that he's
never really been supportive of me
wearing makeup because you know he grew
up in an era where this wasn't accepted
I guess my dad's never been fully
accepting of me wearing makeup but we
kind of don't talk about that part we
don't talk about like me being gay we'd
never talk about me wearing makeup I
don't think I was given my dad a hug
since I was literally like ten years old
because that's not the relationship we
have but I love him deep down and I know
he loves me but yeah that's that but I'm
actually super super super lucky to have
super supporting parents because I know
there are a lot of people out there who
come out as gay or transgender or
lesbian LGBTQ community anything like
that I know they come out and their
parents literally like I've read I've
read horrific stories of parents just
kicking them out and putting them on the
street wanting nothing to do with them
never talking to them again
I've watched you know lifetime movies
where like it's based on true events and
it just makes me so sad so I'm so lucky
that my mum and dad still love me but
dad just doesn't really like the whole
make up part of it but we don't really
talk about that you know what I'm saying
okay guys I'm just going to answer one
more question then I'll wrap this video
up because I've been coming for 20
minutes already chatter boxing non-stop
oh perfect
what are your hangover tips q libido
love you too okay so my hangover tips is
three two one here we go get a notepad
and write it down so as you guys know
up to drink I'm a youtuber a lot of
youtubers love their alcohol they just
love their alcohol just putting it out
there we love a drink or two or three or
ten or twenty basically what I do want
to get home from the club is I have an
inner health plus a multivitamin -
Europe in a big fuck-off bottle of water
and then sometimes if I'm feeling a
little bit iffy during the night I'll
wake up which is good because if you
wake up like probably like four hours
into your sleep you have a big fuck-off
bottle of water and then you wake up in
the morning and you feel so refreshed
and the next day I don't eat body food I
know that that's what everyone wants an
accuser but it just makes you feel like
more so I have like a smoothie or
like a banana Portello is also a really
good hangover drink it just tastes
really good full of sugar but tastes
 good so figure oh yeah there my
hangover tips and if you're underage
sorry can't help you there do anyway
guys I hope you enjoyed this video and
you learn something new about me today I
love you guys so much and I would see
you all in my next video bye see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
