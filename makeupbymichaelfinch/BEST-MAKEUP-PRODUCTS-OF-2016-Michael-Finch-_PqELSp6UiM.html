today I'm going to be bringing you guys
my favorite beauty products we'll make
up rocks of 2016 now I know this is
about 17 days late sorry about that
20 days like I don't know I don't even
know what the date is today but I'm
going to be going over all the my
favorites of 2016 and what I cannot live
without to this day still before I get
started I just wanted to mention that
this video is sponsored by best fiends
so this thing's is basically an app that
you play on your phone it's like a cute
little game and what you need to do is
you need to kill this guy right here
so once you've killed him then you pass
them to the level so that means is
actually a free adventure puzzle game so
you don't need to pay for it it's free
and you just have to match these same
colors like strawberries leaves like
raindrops to defeat this guy here which
is the beast slug you can also connect
this game to Facebook so you can compete
with your friends and see having Kuenn
start and then you can try and beat them
if you want to I'm currently on a little
32 and yeah I'm basically trying to play
this slug away my favorite part about
the game is where you get to join as
many of these up as you can and once you
have it debates this slug so the more
you get in a road the better like the
killing of the slug is going to be I
guess I think that's how I work stuff
out I'm assuming it works my paws been
playing it for as I mentioned earlier
this game is free so you guys can
download it for free I will be leaving
the link down below and if you click the
link down below and download it through
that link you will get $5 free of gold
and diamonds ok so now let's move into
my favorite makeup work of the year
let's start off with primers
promise ok so I can never tell this
primers actually work or not like I know
they create a barrier between your skin
and your foundation and helps it from
stopping getting foundation into your
pores or whatever but I don't know about
time and much how it helps with keeping
your makeup on however I just like
primers that feel good and look like
they're doing something properly so I'm
tossing up between these three others
the two days hangover primers has got
coconut water in it which smells so so
so bored this is probably better off for
dry skin but I do use it around
this part here and then use this one
here on the inside of my skin this is
the on the t0 to my skin this is that
professional matte rescue by benefit
this is very similar to the professional
this is this more liquidy and it slides
around your face more easy eyes that
make sense it doesn't really blow your
pores but it's still on that primer
follow my favorite foundation of the
year you guys know exactly what it is
takes three guesses okay do you know
what it is yet it's obviously a Marc
Jacobs remarkable foundation guys I love
these foundations sort bringing much I'm
never going to have your foundation I'm
in the shade 54 when I'm 10 and 22 this
glass when I am NOT and I'm head of the
moment I'm not actually wearing that
foundation or any different one how
about the coverage on this is just
immaculate or anything the tiniest bit
but maybe me I use half the bottle every
single time that I use it it's a very
very good for oily skin because it does
have a matte finish to it and if you
have dry skin it's probably not the best
you could mix it with another foundation
if you do have dry skin because I feel
like this like this bothers do not give
a lot of coverage but I feel like if you
mix it with something like your
foundation if you do have dry skin it
this will just give you a little bit
more coverage without making it too dry
if that makes any sense
what whatever I just said but yes I
cannot live without this it is amazing
it will always be my favorite until
another full of coverage foundation does
come out again my favourite concealer of
the eye is a 100% shade by Todd I
haven't had this for all that long but
this definitely comes out in the
category a favorite reading makeup
concealer products of 2016 it is so good
the coverage is just amazing it can be
very cakey but if you blend it out
correctly and set it properly it will
not look cakey you guys know I love
using this I use this all the friggin
times it's one worth and people are
journey to get more I'm in the shade fan
neutral I probably will go another shade
darker sometimes what I
ten because it might be a little bit too
late and my burger take my undereye part
here but other than that this concealer
is literally amazing when I say you need
this if you love a full coverage
concealer you need this you really do
need this and a lot of people have been
asking where I got this from I actually
got this from you know top sentence to
me I guess I'll go for me American
Sephora and use go stand together to
Australia said I know it's not on the
Sephora website in Australia yet but it
should be soon so hold tight it is
amazing
everyone needs this concealer now maybe
once a translucent powder to baked my
face it is obviously the RTM a no-tell
the powder this does come in a tie with
the ass one curry powder you guys what
we thinking white in showing that I show
that all the time I've had that for a
bit more than two years now I think this
has to be my favorite translucent powder
this year it's so good
all those of other youtubers and just
people in general do like this product I
feel like it's so good the reason why I
like this or the laura mercier is
because I feel like the Laura Mercier
settles into your fine lines a lot and I
feel like this does differently opposite
and does not build into fine lines
whatsoever so I plan on it so much and
it's got no color at all so it does not
change the color of your concealer your
foundation I know our PMA's does do some
translucent powders that do have a bit
of warmth to them and a little bit of
color but I really prefer this one
favorite foundation powder of 2016 is
definitely the Australis fresh and
flawless now I have been loving is for a
very long time but honestly I haven't
found anything better yet I do need to
get out there and try a lot more powder
foundations I love to use this one to
set my foundation after baking my eyes
I'll go over the rest of my face
with this one here I feel like it's so
good it gives you really good coverage
and a lot of people say it is a juice to
the Mac the Mac the Mac Studio Fix
foundation powder so yeah it's very good
and it's also really really cheating
together doing Priceline I believe and
if one can get it online
my favorite bronzer of 2016 is
definitely the map give me Sun you guys
know I have used this in a lot of my
tutorials if you've been watching me for
a while now I love this bronzer purely
because it's orange and I love looking
for hinge not orange but I just love the
warmth in this it's so nice and it
your eyes you can even use this as an
eye shadow if you haven't liked it every
single day
you know makeup you could just stick
this on your eyes saving you from using
eye shadow it's just so nice it's
perfect for people with like a bluey
green eyes because it does bring them
out a lot that's what we love about it
and it does blend very seamlessly now
actually if I do have my hands when I
was at my friend's house the other day
and she has the my Jacobs or mega
bronzer honestly I would choose that as
it is but I don't have it physically
just showing now that's why I'm choosing
this so I need to get my hands on the
magic and so I may go wrong because that
is also very very incredible and yes
I love it a lemon bar my favorite blush
of this year is definitely the Tarte
blushes now the top lashes although that
bothers them but I thought I'll just
show you my favorite color this is true
love I have used the absolute crap
there's like a low like a mid term like
pinky color I can't get it open with my
acrylics on right now but honestly it's
so good and you have ones blood tends to
fade away during the day this was like a
12 hour blush so it does not move it
doesn't go anywhere and I don't know I
just really like it I really really like
that moving I'm sure your mascara this
is the Too Faced better than sex and I
like to call it better than I have to be
quiet because my family's out there and
also this is the Mac extended play
gigablack lash this is perfect for your
bottom lashes if you are after a good
mascara to accentuate those bottom
lashes you need to get this it is
incredible and this is really good for
top lashes as well it thickens them it's
very very black and it does look super
super cool you know how some people with
mascara there's like you're a mask are
works I don't believe in that I used to
last benefit they're real mascara I
probably still do love that just as much
I probably will fall back in love with
it one day but this has been my favorite
for last year now moving on to
highlighter this will have to be my
favorite this is the ultra
highlighter in the style shade Beverly
Hills but this highlighted is literally
amazing I am someone who bakes a lot
underneath my eyes and puts a lot of
powder on and sometimes that can stop
your highlight from actually showing up
so this no matter how much powder you
put on it this will show up just I'll
just do one little swatch on my hand
this of the colors it is so pigmented I
love it so magic shows off
paddle sorry while all of our
highlighters really work well for me
because they serve pigmented and I drew
settlers of have a very very well and
then I'm very key he's also a massive
yes with me
moving on to lipsticks you guys know I
only really use liquid lipsticks I don't
really use regular lipstick at all my
two favorite brands would have to be
creative beauty and Jeffrey star so I've
got these through two really ones in the
color trendsetter Venus and there's also
another one called bombshell but I've
lost that I don't know where it is
probably somewhere somewhere in my room
but I just don't know where and I'm sure
lazy to even look for it and then with
what Jeffrey start over here with what
mannequin and I am news the formula is
just amazing and the smells of the huda
beauty liquid lipsticks if you have not
smelled leaves before you need to smell
because it's miles better than Kylie
Jenner just it just might work with its
mother take butter and it's not too
strong that it is strong but it's not
too strong so make any sense I don't
know but the formula of these they're
just so long wearing they don't go dry
you can put on a few different layers
and it does not volume you know gold
yucky and crusty like from the googlers
picture everyone to my favorite
eyeshadow to the year obviously it's
going to be the two-degree rose gold
edition but I use if I show a paddle all
the time I'm trying not to use that as
much because I do try to I try not use
it in every single tutorial that I do
just because it's so versatile and it's
so many different colors in it the only
example about this color I don't like is
that the top colors are very hard to
apply in my opinion the eventual platter
with your finger but when you have these
on is very hard to do and get like right
in there so they're not going to what
cut crease or anything like that if you
really want to get the color very
precise so hopefully they change that
one guy but other than that the matte
colors in here are just amazing these
ones here and the black color the black
color is one of the best black eye
shadows of never use coming after
Anastacio Beverly Hills but got an
eyeshadow called
Noah or noir no I don't know how to say
as you can read me for it but um I feel
like this black eyeshadow just does its
job it just blends it doesn't go
everywhere where you put it it stays but
it still blends out if that makes sense
I don't know I'm really busting with our
show so when I say
a lot of my other color you know I
actually love it I can't guard without
this video I without mentioning the
Anastasio Beverly Hills
Modern Renaissance palette this is just
coming novena did such a great job of
creating this it's so pretty
if sort versatile it's got these of
Burgundy's of oranges then it's got your
Browns or your transitions and some of
your shimmery colors palette is so dirty
as a moment that's because it's been
traveling around the world actually not
been just traveling quite often lately
so I shot it all through that I just
want to give a quick mention to glitter
injections on this palette here also
guys these letters are just amazing
these are my glitter ingestion I shadow
they are so pretty I'm really need to
start using more of these Pink's but I
tend to go for like the goals of
Silver's and like the coppery sort of
colors more often by this palette in
itself is just so nice you don't
actually have to use glue when you apply
the glitter injections with it because
it's coming in and it just makes it
stick but if I'm doing like a long way
look or if I'm using on a client I will
use glue just to assure that it just
does things like I really don't want
moving and going anywhere last but not
least let's just finish off with some
setting spray
this isn't selling prices for hydrating
spray you guys know I love the mac fix+
I always have if you guys don't have
this you need to get it it's really good
to wet your brush serve your eye shadow
shows up that up or just apply some
sprays of this before you use your
foundation or your primer or just at the
end it will make your highlight pop a
little bit more it's basically just a
mineral water as if make it look a
little bit more Julie I guess so it's
perfect for people with dry skin if you
have oily skin still use that such as in
moderation although I don't even listen
to myself I'm a straight back and I have
oily skin and ownership I love it and
then it's like getting sprayed into the
dry so it made its way all day I have a
few different flavors of this sense of
business is the Green Team splashes
ginger this has got quite a bit of
alcohol in it so it does make your
makeup stay on very good only downfall
about it is if you get in your eyes it
does sting hence all the alcohol being
in there but I honestly does do the job
very very well so that is all of my
favorite makeup products of 2016 I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you did don't forget to give it a
massive thumbs up I love you guys
and I'll see you all in my next video
