today I'm gonna show you how to get this
look what do you think today's video is
going to be a voiceover just cuz I'm not
feeling very lively today so when that
happens I'll do a voiceover just to let
you know for future reference all the
products that used today will be down in
the description box below and without
any further ado let's get straight into
the tutorial okay let's get straight
into this so voice there was a kind of
awkward to film but who cares yeah
first of all I'm just taking the mac
fix+ to hydrate my skin then I'm moving
on to the benefit and that rescue primer
just to use something different today
now I'm trying out some new foundation
today this is the cover FX custom cover
drops and yeah I probably the wrong
color and I didn't even know that it was
just like a stick form top drop it at
the end and that's when I just realized
so basically this is probably the wrong
color for me this is true yellow but
that's what you get when you buy a
foundation on line isn't it well and
then just blending all of that in with
my Beauty butter and I'm just going in
sections because I don't like when I try
a new foundation or a new concealer I
don't know how hard it is to blend out
like how long that dries and all that
sort of stuff then I'm taking the Mac
Pro Longwear concealer in the shade NC
15 and I'm using that to highlight my
face and also using that as an eye base
then blending it out with Mac concealer
once again oh my god so I bought this
Aussie I'm a no colour powder cos Jaclyn
hill and everyone raised about it and
it's actually really friggin good I'll
talk about it more in another video to
set the rest of my foundation I just use
the Australia's fresh and a flawless
pressed powder now moving on to the eyes
so I'm not gonna tell you all the
different shades of what I'm using in
the video but I'm gonna leave them all
down below for you so basically I'm just
going from a light to dark so I use the
skintone color that I'm using the
lighter gray and then the bit of a
darker grey which I'll go into now and
then I'm kind of just I want to keep
this look super super super super
blended and sometimes I struggle with
that because my eyeshadow Kangra patchy
just because my eyes
I don't know if it's my eyes or just my
technique but I was just trying to keep
it so so so blended going with the black
was really scary like still out of my
comfort zone a little bit
but I mean we got there in the end so it
looks really patchy and just like a
straight line and just a black piece of
 but don't worry I'm actually gonna
blend that out basically all a black
smokey eye
silver gray smokey eye is just blending
going backwards and forwards blending
going backwards and forwards and can be
so time-consuming so if you ever do to a
smoky eye like this make sure you have a
lot of time on your hands because if you
rush it it's gonna look like you got
punched in the face now I'm
just going in with some black on a
little flat shader brush just underneath
just to define then going back in with a
little bit more of a grey color just to
blend that out again now for the fun
part I'm going with a silver pigmented
eyeshadow and I'm just fixing my brush
with a little bit of fix+ to make the
color a little bit more intense I guess
I'm just gonna use that as a base for my
glitter actually I lied I'm gonna go in
with the glitter glue from Too Faced and
just apply that over that area where I
want all the silver glitter to go and
yeah just patting you'd need the tiniest
a little bit of glitter glue a tiny bit
then I'm going in with the star of the
show this is the mac and Ghoulies hot in
the shade silver I think it's just
silver sorry I'm sorry awkward with my
voiceovers on my girl what I do what I
say now I'm just creating a wing with
the studio gel liner from Maybelline
this is the best Joanna ever if you
don't have it then you need to get it
and then just also taking that gel liner
in my waterline just a little bit
because I'm just gonna smoke that down
just a touch now that's what it looks
like I'm gonna go do the other eye and
I'm
back I'm just dusting off all that
powder that we no longer need anymore
and great to get rid of that darling now
for mascara I'm using the voluminous
carbon black mascara Jaclyn hill
Kardashian's always rave about this and
it's really good now for my lashes I'm
using slate everyday in Natalie we all
know how to put lashes on I don't need
to film that honey now for bronzer I'm
just using a bronzer that's not too
orange because my skin is quite pale
today for a change
oh and I'm just brushing up my entire
face with that but just running that
down the sides of my nose a little bit
as well to bring the face together
now to contour I'm just using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit and
just contouring my face away and don't
forget to contour your jawline actually
no you probably won't need to as much as
me because I like a really strongly
intense see that now I have a jawline
amazing now for my blush I'm using this
makeup geek blush I forget the name but
I'll leave it down below
it is amazing as my new favorite blush
it's like a luminescent like but it's
just so nice I don't know I'm obsessed
with it's so pretty
for highlight today i'm gonna be using
Jeffrey's king touch just with a little
bit of fix+ on my brush just to
intensify it a little bit more
now to make things a little bit more
interesting I'm just gonna take that
two-faced and glitter glue on the inner
corners now I'm taking this glitter
highlighter from glitter injections
called pina colada and I'm gonna be
packing that on to my inner corner
because I feel like it just makes it
look even better I don't know it might
be too much for some people you could
totally skip this stuff if you want to
you can even skip the glitter on the lid
if you need to and you can totally skip
this step - I'm just applying some of
that glitter highlighter on my cheeks oh
yeah
moving on to my lips this is my new
favorite liquid lipstick this is Kat Von
D bow and arrow it is amazing check out
the color stunning not true
drying it dries really really really
well
I feel yeah and then it and then I'm
gonna be going in with some Jeffrey star
I'm nude just on the inner part of my
lips just to kind of like ombre it a
little bit at this point I realized it
was so glitter on my finger so I went
all in my lips but because
sorry this is the finished look I hope
