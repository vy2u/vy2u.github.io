here is my first Halloween tutorial so
let's just get straight into it I'm just
taking a DS ellipse that I bought off
eBay
they were $28 I think I saw Laura Lee
use them in her veneer that she did of
her interpretation of this look so this
is inspired by Laura and many other
youtubers I'll leave a few of my
favorites down below for you guys so you
can go check some other interpretations
out but these lips were so hard to work
with I wanted to cry as you can see I
was struggling and then I tried putting
them on with some spirit gum and then
some extra flesh from mehron oh by the
way guys all listed all products will be
listed down below and I'm just like
trying to stick it on and they're just
so sticky and horrible and I didn't even
know what I was doing but I worked with
it and then I ended up painting some
liquid latex over the top to seal it all
in and then padding over those sticky
ass looking ass lips with some
translucent powder just because they
were so sticky then moving on to my eyes
I'm just using the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer in the shade NC 15 just to use
as an eye base today and I'm taking that
on my hands and then just blending that
out with my Beauty Blender and then just
setting it with some translucent powder
to make sure it does not move and it
stays in place and doesn't crease on Mac
crusty-ass so what are we doing next we
are preparing for just some eye shadow
I'm just taking some random Brown shades
from makeup geek I'll leave them all
down below if you guys are interested I
know I use Peach Smoothie l'arte some
Coco bear tan lines and I just threw
everything in there like I don't even
know what I was doing I just wanted the
eyes to look semi decent I didn't put
that much time and effort into them
purely because I wanted to focus this on
the rest of the look rather than just
having these immaculate looking eyes I
am then just using a new shade from
makeup geek called legend I had to show
you guys just because it's pretty cool
and she I was popping that on my lid and
then just doing a wing you guys know I'm
just skipping this wing because well
I've done a million wings before moving
on to the face I'm just taking the Tarte
primer and just priming my skin with
that and for foundation I'm just using
the hourglass vanish Foundation stick
the shade warm beige I think and I was
matching this to my neck meaning my tan
so I'm just blending that out with my
morphe g36 brush because it is quite a
thick foundation and I did go over the
lips sure I wasn't sure how I was going
to go with that part but I just went
over and it was all it was fine and then
just taking a day Beauty Blender and
quickly blending that all out to make
sure there are no harsh lines or
anything and then just going with my uh
Nastasia foundation state misses in the
shade porcelain I'm just using this as a
concealer just to change it up a little
bit today and it really did do the job
don't worry about highlighting you know
it's like I did you'll find out why
later I don't really know what I was
doing this is kind of going with the
flow and just hoping that it all worked
out in the end
you know okay and then I'm just blending
it out with my Beauty Blender drone I've
already said that and then I'm just
setting that with my RCM a translucent
powder to ensure we get no lines or
anything although it doesn't have to
look perfect I was taking a ton of
that on the big brush and just setting
it and getting all up my nose and in my
mouth which was stunning just to contour
I'm just using the Anastasia Beverly
Hills contour kit and creating a jaw
line singers I don't have one
and yes just contouring away not really
making it perfect as I said I don't want
to look too focus on the makeup even
though I just said that now I'm just
making my contour where to clean up the
line
oh well I'm just taking a bit my brown
shadow and just running that straight
underneath my eye just so it all sort of
joins up just adding a little bit of
mascara by the way guys products will be
listed down below all products will be
listed down below so yeah just applying
some lashes from iris Beauty in the
shade fearless and then just putting a
bit of black in my waterline to define
my eyes a little bit more now I'm just
starting to work on bruises but I was
just playing around I just wanted to
show you guys this part but I do go back
to the bruises afterwards but I am just
doing my nose I'm just taking some
spirit gum and applying that all over my
nose letting it go a bit tacky just by
tapping that cuz that activates spirit
gum all just letting it dry and then I'm
just taking some everyday cotton balls
and sticking that on with a band-aid and
I did have a little bit of trouble
sticking this band-aid down because it
wasn't big enough because my nose is so
 big so I had to use spirit gum
too as you can see I'm struggling I've
got and
up sticking to make up brushing my nose
anyway and then just moving back onto
the bruisers I'm just taking about
seventy five thousand different shades
of eye shadows from makeup geek I'll
leave all the ones that I use down below
if you guys are interested I feel like
the bruisers were pretty good like they
didn't look that fake I tried to make
them look as realistic as possible I'm
incorporating some mustard colors
yellows greens Purple's Gray's blacks
just little little little is less sorry
less is more when it comes to bruising
because a little bit goes a long way I
then just tried to create a bit of a
bruise under my eye and I'm just
darkening that up around the nose area
to make it look a little bit darker
which I felt like made the look complete
and then I'm just taking a little bit
around my mouth I know when you get lip
injections you don't really bruise
around that area of your mouth but it's
over the top it's exaggerated
it's Halloween and then
just dusting off my cheek contour
because I thought it was even there when
I was filming this and I'm just doing a
little bit more of a bruise on my
forehead just because why not and then
just taking a pencil pen liner from
Rimmel and I'm just drawing on those you
know little dots Lyons thing with the
little arrows poking up here and there
so I'm just adding them all over my face
under my eyes and on my cheeks on my
chin above my eyebrows I just added the
little arrows everywhere because I don't
know I felt like it just looked cool and
that's like the thing you do because
that's what they plan out went like when
they do your face they plan it out with
the arrows whatever I don't even know
what I'm saying and then just going in
with a brown liquid lipstick to add some
lipstick to them big ass looking ass
lips and then I'm just going over with a
gloss from morphe just to make them look
extra big and like juicy and just
unattractive you know what I mean that's
what the look I'm going for then I'm
just taking some coagulated blood from
mehron I think this was and a little bit
of stage blood just mixing the two
together because once darker ones latter
so I'm just mixing them together and
just shoving blood all up my nose and
down the side of my mouth just for an
extra effect by the way guys I'm really
stuffy and I sound like I've been I
don't know whatever I've been doing
because I am sick at the moment and I am
filming this voiceover when I'm seeing
I'm sorry but I really wanted to have
this video up today for you guys so I
tried my best
I was drinking green tea before to try
and clear everything but I don't know if
it worked so I'm just adding heaps of
blood around my mouth and my nose to try
and make it look as Halloweeny as
possible you know what I mean and then
I'm just taking out my hair and then I'm
grabbing some freakin toilet paper I
didn't have a bandage and I realized at
that moment how dumb I looked so I'm
just wrapping toilet paper around my
head and kind of sticking it down with
some latex just so it stays there I just
tried using miss Burt Gummer didn't work
so I'll just use latex and just sticking
it around and that's pretty much the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed it
this tutorial and if you do don't forget
to give it a thumbs up and here is a
little bit of Peel Porter for you guys
because I know you guys would appreciate
this or some of you would look how
disgusting that is anyway guys I love
you so much and I will see you all in
Friday's video so stay tuned for that
