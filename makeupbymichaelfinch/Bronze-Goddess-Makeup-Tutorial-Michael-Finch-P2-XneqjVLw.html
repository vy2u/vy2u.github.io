today I'm going to be doing a bronze
goddess makeup tutorial and you might be
able to tell because I do have fake tan
on so yeah obviously gonna be matching
that to my face and it's going to be
nice and bronzy I've got a few products
in front of me that I really want to use
today that I want to be involved in the
tutorial like I've got some key products
that I just want to whack on my face
that I haven't really used in a while or
used in tutorials before so I'm kind of
excited to do that without any further
ado let's just get straight into the
video and if you enjoyed make sure you
give this video a thumbs up now to begin
this I'm just going to start off with
benefits new brow pencil this is the
goof proof a brow pencil I'm just gonna
do my eyebrows off camera no one's
interested as it takes up so much time
now that my brows are all filled in
let's move on to ah hey let's do face
bath today just because I feel like
doing something different hand sorry for
primer today I'm going to be using a
Curtiss collection by Victoria this is
the normal to dry skin a face primer
because my skin is quite dry I am going
to be using a different primer today I'm
just going to take a p2 pea-sized amount
what the is there a hair on my
finger now I'm gonna be taking a few
squirts of mac fix+ just to hydrate my
skin a little bit more I love the smell
of this stuff so much it literally
smells like sexy cucumbers okay for my
foundation today I'm going to be going
back to my absolutely Holy Grail
foundation this is the perfecting liquid
foundation from power bond this is in
the color neutral beige love this
this beauty apply that is literally so
dirty like it's got eyeliner all over it
from my brushes and lift it's the wrong
stuff hitting it and as seriously looks
like mold but I can definitely assure
you it is not mold because I would not
be putting that on my face because
I do have ten on
want to ruin the I'm gonna
put it on this metal pallet here now
what I like to do with my foundation is
just get my just a random foundation
brush I like to brush it on my skin
first before I blend it out with a
Beauty Blender just because they feel
like it doesn't soak up as much the
Beauty Blender if that makes any sense I
don't know
so as you guys can see I'm just painting
this across my face literally painting
it across my face now I'm just gonna be
taking a little bit of mac fix+ buy my
Beauty Blender I'm just getting that a
bit of a squirt just to moisten that up
a little bit more and then imma blend
all of this out now to use as an eye
base a and highlight my whole face I'm
going to be taking the Urban Decay Naked
skin concealer and the shade fair
neutral so I'm just applying that to the
top part of my eye and then I'm just
grabbing a little like brush now I'm
just going to take that concealer all
the way down to my lash line and then
I'm just going to take my damp Beauty
Blender again and I'm just going to
blend that out now before my eyes get a
chance to crease I'm just going to set
them with some Ifrah translucent setting
powder I'm just going to dust that over
my eyelids just what doesn't crease
because you know how fuck's up your
shadow with the creases and it looks
really bad I just change my mind to
highlight underneath in my eyes in my
face I'm going to be using the LA girl
Pro conceal in the shade porcelain oh my
god I actually love this concealer so
much I bought five new tubes of this
porcelain shade yesterday actually and I
can't wait to get them in the mail
because this porcelain one is almost out
once again I'm just taking my fix+
and make Beauty but now spraying that
and then I'm just going to blend it all
out
it's actually really full-coverage like
how much is a two dollar seventy-five
this concealer it's from a shop called
lady mops that's where I got them from
like that's true seventy five USD but
when it comes to Australian dollars it's
literally like five dollars so what's
everyone been doing yeah can you guys
leave in the comments below when the
last time was that you got drunk I
haven't been drunk since I got
from Brisbane well I was drinking in
Melbourne but having a drunk cousin like
drunk drunk once my under eye concealer
and everything is all buttoned out I'm
going to go in with my Oprah translucent
setting powder and I'm just going to
bake under my eyes and all the
highlighted areas with that so when I
bake I basically just grab it on a
Beauty Blender and just slowly bounce
the product off the skin rather than
wiping I just bounce it why I have no
idea that a good thing about this la
girl Pro concealer I feel like this
doesn't crease quickly or crease much at
all which is excellent considering they
can seal up is so goddamn cheap now to
make sure the rest of my foundation does
not slide off everywhere all over my
face throughout the whole entire day I
was going to be taking my Australis
fraiche and a flawless press powder in
the shade medium tan just on a big
fluffy brush and I'm just going to Pat
in the foundation rather than swipe like
swipe it in some areas but rather than
swipe I'd rather just Pat because then
it doesn't move the product that is
underneath it first I want to go in with
is makeup geek frappe just to use as
kind of like a sort of transitioning
sort of colour now I'm not going to
focus this look on the mat crease
colours I want to be really bronzy and
like I don't know bronzy and highlighted
and like really pretty like that now I'm
going to dip into the shade called maca
and I'm just gonna be focusing that on
the outer V area now I'm going to be
using makeup geek corrupt which is the
black eyeshadow and I'm just going to
dip my brush into a bit of corrupt and
then back into a bit of maca and I
really just want to focus that on the
outer V and try not to bring it too high
I'm just going to take the brush that I
was blending Michael with and I'm just
going to go over that black just because
I don't want any more product of black
being added on to the area
there's point in time god I sound like a
bit of a politician and you know now I'm
going to be going into a pigment from
that makeup geek this is called a poker
face I'm just gonna wet my brush with a
little bit of fix+
bum bum and then I'm just going to go
straight onto my lid another fallout
that just happened I'm just gonna brush
that away and ladies and gentlemen that
is why I bake it's well apps off
when you need it to and it's fabulous
now to make it a little bit more glam
I'm just going to take my two-faced
glitter glue I'm just going to put that
in the middle and I'm just going to kind
of Pat around the edges where I want it
to blend out this was small it's like a
full line of glitter now I'm going to be
using my glitter injections good press
the glitter I don't know what shade this
is in but I'll leave it down below just
gonna plop that in the middle sort of
thing and then kind of just drag it
towards the inner corner now I am going
to try and refrain myself from doing a
wing today and it's gonna be so hard cuz
I love wings but I always doing so I
want to change it up a little bit for
you guys so I'm going to be taking the
makeup geek full spectrum eyeliner
pencil in the shade op CD on or C
whatever I give up literally and I'm
just going to tightline my eyes so I've
kind of just brought that out into a
wing like shape I couldn't resist you
know me
I'm kind of just drawing on up as much
harp just with a little bit of
something-something going on along the
top of my eyelid now just taking a
little bit more eye makeup geek corrupt
I am just going to go over that liner
and kind of just smudge it out a bit
it's kind of turning into like a smokey
sort of wing if that's what we were
going for I don't know now moving on to
under there I'm just going to take
frappe again and now I am just going to
be taking a little bit of mock up
underneath as well now to make things
that little bit more exciting I'm just
going to take a little bit more glitter
glue just right on the inner corner
underneath my eye and just taking that
glitter injections I show again
now guys we'll finish the eyes later
first of all I'm just going to finish
doing the face which is the most
exciting part um what would be a bronze
goddess makeup tutorial without using
back to give me son Oh so I'm just
taking a big fluffy brush to do this and
I'm literally just packing it on now I'm
just going to be bringing that up around
at my forehead as well and I'm just kind
of running that around my nose to
conjure up I'm just gonna use Michaels I
always say Michaels will put my name on
the hoola bronzer from benefit and I'm
going to be using my favorite contouring
brush which is the the way 1 to 7 luxe

contour my own well non-existent jaw
line as I say all the time now I really
want to bake my contour today so I'm
just going to take that very fra
translucent powder again just on my
Beauty Blender put my mascara today I'm
going to be using the Too Faced better
than sex or as I like to call it to face
better than dick mascara for blush I'm
going to be taking makeup geeks blush in
the color of romance for my highlight

Jeffrey's jar King Tut I'm also just
going to be taking that on the tip of my
nose and my nose bridge just on a small
to finer brush my Cupid's bow and also a
little bit on the inner corners of my
eyes for my eye lashes today I'm going
to be using at the style Chloe by the
company called billion lashes and I'm
just gonna plop that straight on oh my

I'm just going to be taking the lipliner
in the shade spicy by pout cosmetics and
lining my lips with this now for my lip
stick I'm gonna be taking this matte
liquid lipstick by moly cosmetics now to
top this whole look off I'm just gonna
be taking a lip gloss from designer
