you
hey guys today's tutorial is a little
inspired makeup tutorial inspired by
Thomas Halbert I'll leave his link down
below so you can go and check his a
video app as well so moving on to the
makeup we're going to be using the mac
prolongwear concealer in the shade NC 15
and i'm just going to be using that to
carve out my eyebrows and I'm actually
going to be spreading that all across my
lid too to use as an eyeshadow base
today because it's one of the best
eyeshadow bases there is so I'm
literally just covering and taking my
lids with that concealer and then I'm
taking my damn Beauty Blender just to
blend everything out to assure there is
no creasing and no lines at all and then
I'm just going straight in with some
translucent powder I believe it was the
ICMA one just to set my lids so there's
no creasing and it's ready for the eye
shadow now for my eye shadow today I'm
going to be using the mani MUA X makeup
geek palette and we're starting off with
the shade here in the middle and I'm
going to be putting that into my outer
crease and blending upwards now because
I do have footed eyes as you like to
bring my eyeshadows quite high up so if
you have hooded eyes too that's probably
a really good idea so you can see it
when your eyes are open and closed now
what I'm going to be doing is putting
majority of the color on the outer
corner and the inner corner so we're
basically going to be keeping all of
this middle part here clear because
that's where we're going to be putting
shimmery colors and some glitter moving
on to the next color I'm just taking
this beautiful burgundy pinky color and
I'm just taking a little definer brush
and kind of mapping out where I'm going
to be putting this color now these
eyeshadows are so blendable you can do
stuff like just plop it on and worry
about blending later it's not going to
dry it's very very blendable and you can
pack on the color SuperDuper well makeup
geek shadows are known to their land
ability and they're butteriness so yeah
that's what I'm doing now as you can see
I'm taking a little bit more of that
show that we first started off with and
I'm just blending out that color today's
look is all about going back in with the
colors and then moving to the next one
and then going back to the one before
that to blend that out you know what I
mean if that makes sense
I don't know so yeah I'm just doing
that and going back in with that color
once again now taking this nice dark
brown Verona sort of color time to
define a little bit more I guess so I'm
just going to be putting that on the out
of the up a little bit not bringing a
past that pinkish burgundy color that I
used before so as you can see I'm just
blending that out nicely and then going
back in with a little bit more of that
pinky burgundy shade to blend out that
darker maroon color on my lid as I said
this look at the back going backwards
and forwards plakavoids backwards and
forwards now just focusing a little bit
on at the inner corner of my eye to use
that halo sort of effect and I'm just
applying a generous amount of color and
then blending it all I love this looks
very much already
it's just so nice and yeah just blend
blend and blend and blend and blend and
keep blending and don't stop as you can
see I'm just packing out a little bit
more of that darker shade on the inner
corner and then blending that out also
now we are moving on to the lid so this
is the halo part of the eye so I was
taking those two shimmery shades from
the Money palette and I did wet my brush
with a little bit of 6 plus to give a
better pigmentation and I'm bringing it
up through my crease almost to my brow
bone because I do have sort of eyes you
really want to still be able to know
that there is a halo effect going on I
am just also blending out those sides so
it's nice and smooth moving on to the
glitter I'm just taking the Too Faced a
glitter glue on this little tiny brush
here and kind of doing a little triangle
shape like the point of the triangle at
my eyebrow and then down to the base now
the glitter I'm using is from lit
cosmetics called champagne wishes it's
so freakin beautiful I cannot even
explain why I haven't used this before
I've had it for so long and I found out
I was like this could be stunning so I'm
just putting that all over my lid
packing it on generously and yeah as you
can see I'm just adding more and more
glitter to really build it up and make
it look just like cool like I think this
looks so awesome I love this eyeshadow
look it's just as its saying I just
quickly did the other eye off
right now we are back and I'm using the
Kylie Jenner eyeliner chi liner I think
it's called honestly not that great no
shade but oh my gray pretty dry I am
just blending that eyeliner out with
some of the darkest color that we used
on my eyelid just to make it a little
bit smoky just a little bit smoky now
moving on to mascara to sweetheart
mascara this is actually pretty good do
you guys like this is pretty good
tightness cars aren't all that bad
I do quite like them so yeah I'm just
applying that on both of my eyes and
then I'm going to be popping on some
Lily lashes these are in the style
divine they are so stunning I'm just
using a little bit of my house of lashes
black lash glue applying that on the
lash letting it dry a 30 seconds and
then just sticking that right on my eye
I like to look down when I apply my
lashes you're meant to look straight
ahead but that ain't nobody got
time for that
so I'm just popping that straight on as
you can see struggle down a little bit
and that's what the lash looks like
absolutely stunning now we are just
wiping off a little bit of the fall out
gotta fall out with a Neutrogena makeup
light which are my favorites and now we
are starting on the face using the Kim
Chi over r12 lash moisturizer / prime
I'm just applying a generous amount of
that all over my face down my Chin's and
on through my necks and then also my
forehead a little bit of six-plus up in
there are you shocked oh are you shocked
and just to moisten up the skin now
we're taking two of my favorite
foundations the Giorgio Armani luminous
silk and the my Jacobs remarkable mixing
those two together and I'm just wanting
to apply that to my face with a paddle
brush I am a little bit 10 at the moment
hence why I'm using a darker color than
my face so I'm just packing that all
over my face and making sure everything
is covered what I like to do instead of
using a light concealer I just take the
same foundation shade that I'm using and
just conceal the tops of my brows just
so there's no I'm not highlighting the
tops of my brows you know what I mean so
they don't collect little shield for
anything like that I used to do that
back in the box but now I just use the
foundation color that I'm using
taking my beauty blender I think it was
that but I'm just spritzing with a bit
of six-plus just to just for show I
guess I don't know why I even do it so
I'm just blending out all of my
foundation with the Beauty Blender it
looks so good I think it's just such a
full of combo the Georgia our money and
Marc Jacobs remarkable sorry good
coverage so absolutely stunning now
moving on to concealer are you shocked
that I'm using this again are you
shocked just applying at the top shape
tape around the corners of my mouth my
chin Cupid's bow my nose bridge and my
forehead I like to do that part first I
blend it all out and then do my under
eyes just because I said icon dries
crease really quickly especially if you
mean you have little creases is there
any way to get rid of actors like Botox
or something get rid of the little
creases under your eyes I don't know
anyway so I've just applied an absolute
 ton of that and I'm just blending
that out with my Beauty Blender as you
can see really getting all up in those
creases packing it in there and then I'm
going to be going straight in with my
 transitions along tutorial I'm
going to give you going straight in with
my celebre Pro translucent powder from
Aron I have not used this inner half
 minute I actually found it
in my makeup drawer the day I filmed
this and I was like I'm like what I
haven't users in so long maybe I can
change it up from the ICMA and the Kroy
because I bet you guys are sick of
seeing that you just know what
translucent powder I'm going to use so I
shocked you all today and decided to use
something else stunning and I'm also
just setting the rest of my face with
start trances and paddle also just so I
didn't have to use the Australis
pressures once again I could join every
tutorial ok think here moving on to the
Oprah versatile map runs up this is
absolutely stunning I love this so much
I'm just taking my benefit a bronzing
brush to run up my face and just
blending that all out I really need to
get the Marc Jacobs Omega bronze or like
I love it so much I've only used it
twice it's my friends and it's out of
stock on Sephora the other day I
disappointed when I went to get it
because line looks like last week it was
in stock and now it's out of stock Oh
anyway just bronzing up my jaw line as
well should give a little bit
give dimension to the face and also
ever-so-slightly running that down the
side of my nose because it did get a
little bit lost in the concealer so I
don't look like I have a nose now taking
the makeup geek
contour shade in the shade complicated
and just contouring ever so slightly
well actually it's quite dramatic I
really want to like I want that day to
come where my conscious looks absolutely
flawless like I feel like my contour
always looks a little bit muddy like I
don't know I don't know what it is but
if I don't put enough on then it doesn't
look contoured you know what I mean but
if I put too much on then it looks a
little bit muddy I don't know it looks
good from the front but from the side
it's not all that gray so I need to work
on that now moving on to blush this is
the main squeeze from makeup geek or so
I'm just applying a little bit of that
on my cheeks and blending back to the
end of the contour when you mate you
just with a little cute brush and now we
are moving on to underneath my eyes I'm
basically doing exactly what I did on
top of the eye underneath the eye so I'm
just taking that first shade that we use
the brown one on underneath my eye on
the inner corner and the outer corner
leaving the middle part free because the
middle part and we'll be putting a
little bit of good also so I'm just
taking that little brush and going in
with the maroon shade and then I go
straight into the dark burgundy maroon
shade that I used to define and just
topping that in there I think this looks
so cool this like effect is just awesome
like it's so different but it's still
normal I'm just taking a little bit of
the chi liner on the outer corner of my
waterline and the inner corner and it's
not that dramatic because this eyeliner
is quite dry and it's not that pigmented
you know what I mean so it didn't do all
that much but it still did a little
something which was nice because it
didn't take away from the glitter and
everything I don't know so I'm just
popping a little bit of that glitter
underneath right right in a triangle
that teardrop sort of effect now I'm
going with my face mascara for bottom
lashes this is Mac extended play
gigablack lash I thought I'd show you
guys a close-up of me doing my mascara
and using this mascara just to show how
good it actually is so it really does
define the bottom lashes without
clumping them it lengthens them and it
thickens them all at the same time and
just does such a good job I think it
looks so cool just cleaning up my
contour a little bit with some more of
that translucent powder because it did
go quite messy with that so I'm just
cleaning that up and then I'm dusting it
off literally ten seconds later because
this translucent powder is so strong and
it does leave a harsh line so get that
off real quick
now I found this the other day this is
the Lina lashes highlight palette I have
not used this ever before so and I was
pretty impressed like look at that it's
not bad it wasn't muddy or anything like
that it blended really nicely so I'm
just applying that on my cheeks my nose
bridge Cupid's bow you guys know the
drill now for my lip color this is a
jeffree star cosmetics no tea no shade I
did just line my lips with the hooter
Beauty lip liner in the style in the
shade icon just to get a rough outline
when I do do dark lips I do like to
outline my lips a little bit or either
line them and I'm just filling back in
with the lipstick shade I never really
do dark lips but when I do I don't know
I just feel like it doesn't suit me I
guess but I really want to change it up
be bad because I know some of you are
probably sick of seeing a nude frigging
lips so I changed it up and this was the
outcome and this is one of Jeffrey's
immunity liquid lipsticks and I think
the colors really different and cool and
then I'm just taking some of the Gerard
cosmetics lay all day in the shade in
the smell lavender just to set my face
this does such a good job and oh that's
it we are done so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did please
don't forget to give me a thumbs up I
love you guys so much and I'll see you
all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
