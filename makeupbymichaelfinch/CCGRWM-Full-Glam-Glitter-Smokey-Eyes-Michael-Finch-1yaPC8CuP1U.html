feels so good to be sitting down with my
normal background and back at home
filming had not touched me too much
because Yolo come to me every time so
today I thought I would just sit down
and film me doing my makeup catching up
on what's been going on lately a lot has
been going on so uh yeah it's time to
catch up so let's do it I'm going to
start off with my eyes as usual oh by
the way mrs. at the airport
when I had to pick up my 35 kilo
suitcase because it was sorry had
because I bought so much added ass
pralines pronounced I did ass not add a
task but I say out of that so slow up
anyway let's do my eyes first
okay now the way up nice and close let's
go straight in on my eyes now I've
already done my brows and concealed
underneath them so let's go straight
into your eyeshadow and I do have my
trusty little green juice here because
I'm obsessed with green juice it's
burning see sippy I literally just
looked like the biggest butcher Pig
anyway let's do my eyes so I'm just
going to go straight on these lids with
a little bit a little bit of touch shape
tape just to use as a base to my eyes
today yes so as you guys know I just got
back from New Zealand you guys might
have seen my vlog might not have if you
haven't go check it out it's the last
video after this one and it was so
beautiful I need to go to New Zealand
more and I really am going to because I
had the best time over there
I love Kris we have such a good
friendship and everyone things we hate
each other because we back each other
out of line all the time like my wife
calling big and he called me Miss Piggy
and people take offense to that I don't
know why but people think we're being
serious but I'm shocked we're not okay
I'm just going to set my lives with a
little bit of the dermablend
professional setting powder I pick us up
in price line the other day to give it a
shot so I'm just going to take that on
my lids and just Pat it over and I am
going to be using this powder as a I'm
baking today so I'll let you know how
they how it goes with the flash back but
today I kinda just want to do like a
black smoky eye shock with a glitter
liner so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to be using my huda beauty palette
do not kill me I'm obsessed with this
palette if you don't have it I love it
some people hate it I don't know how
they hate it
but it works for me but it might not
work for you so I'm just putting that
out there but I love it and I love the
consistency and I love working with it
so I'm just going to take sandalwood
this honestly feels like I did this
every video which I'm going to do but
that's fine
and I'm going to start buffing that into
make freeze because it's going to be the
transition is on my lid and the more the
glitter liner is going to show up I
don't really know what I'm doing I'm
just going to go with it and see what
happens
as always my video looks I like really
never planned out until I sit down and I
start you know doing my eyes my eyebrows
and I feel like it's so fun that way so
I was in New Zealand for Chris's
birthday I'll leave some snapchats
right here so you can check out how my
night was enjoy so my beat today was
done by Miss Piggy happily be a chef I
got my big director fucka what hi
everybody
ate my air you know what I'm getting
tonight in my mail
so yeah that wasn't my night it was so
good and I met so many of you guys and
it was so nice to meet some New Zealand
Sam I also just wanted to say when I was
out clubbing okay when I was out
clubbing I just want to quickly talk
about something a little for a second
now just before I do say this I don't
want anyone to twist my words because
you guys know I love meeting you guys
and this was not my fault so we were in
this club and we're in this VIP area and
people started seeing that we were there
and they started like lining up and
people were screaming and starting to go
crazy and security was like what the
 anyway so everyone was like waiting
outside VIP and a couple of girls got
into the IP I don't know if they were
meant to be in there or I'm not really
sure but they got in and one of them was
like snapchatting me and I'm like yeah
that's cool and then she did it again
and I was like I just want to enjoy my
night and I don't want to have and like
people up in my face snapchatting me so
I just like talked on the show and I
said just out of respect could you not
snapchat me so if that was you I'm sorry
if I offended you that wasn't my
intention she was cool with it she was
like that's okay like understand blah
blah blah
but I'm how does one enjoy my night and
like my whole life is a camera and when
people keep coming up in your face not
trying to say like my whole life is the
camera like I'm such just celebrity
because I'm not I'm just like you I'm
just like a normal person that makes
YouTube videos but it's nice to have a
little bit of privacy and just have the
camera off for a little bit do not I
mean so when people trying to invade
that I don't know people are going to
twist those words but go see your last
because I said it the way I'm thinking
it so deliver but yeah then we we went
to leave the club and there were piece
of people waiting for us and security
wouldn't let us go through that way so
they took us out the back way so we
weren't ignoring you guys I would never
ever intentionally do that we weren't
allowed to go out that way so that's why
that's what happened and people are
going to twist that and whatnot but
that's fine
I'm just saying my opinion of how all
went okay now I'm going to take the
shade called henna I'm just going to put
that throughout my crease a little bit
more
i jus I wanted to be like a warm look I
want it to be like well it's already
warm I mean it always is but I want it
to be like super black on the lid when I
was in New Zealand my friend's friend
was doing like a black smoky eye and she
packed the once in the huda beauty
palette and then she mixed it with um
Noah nor Noah from that from Anastasia
Beverly Hills and it was the other lacus
 I've ever seen and it was so
amazing
I do have Anastasia Beverly Hills NOLA
somewhere in the lavish palette like
that on a star to your palate that's
been around for years I don't think I
sell it anymore actually but I've still
got a Dino Noah's Noah is in there and
I'd like to do that but today we're not
going to what it's going to go okay now
I'm going to dip into a black truffle
from the hooter palette and I'm going to
start packing that on my lid and what I
like to do is I like to Pat the product
on first so it's super like it's fully
on there and then I'll go in and blend
it all out afterwards so yes just on the
lid area with this now it's going to
take a little bit of cocoa from huda
beauty palette and I'm going to go over
the edges up black and just pray to God
that it blends out well my virus
blending so easy I lost a little bit of
henna in here but that's fine because we
can just go back in
I feel like black smokey eyes are one of
those things is just going back in and
out with your shadows until you've got
the desired you know pigment I guess
just back over that with a little bit
more black so super pigmented and then
just taking a smaller brush with a
little bit more cocoa and just going
over the edge of black truffle to blend
it all in yes okay now that I've got
both eyes done I'm just going to take
the swing eyeliner from the balm and
alright so I'm just going to do like
half a wing okay I'm going to let that
dry off and I'm going to go in with the
glitter liner afterwards okay so after
those wings are done I'm going to take
the Urban Decay heavy metal liquid
eyeliner in Midnight Cowboy now I have
been looking for this in stock in store
for so long and I got the last
one I snatched it at the new zealand
auckland airport i was so lucky because
it was literally the laughs and I'm like
this is meant to be like because it
started on Mecca like everywhere and I'm
just like what the ever
and it's
now the stock online everywhere so I was
like bye finally got it so I'm never
losing this it's like a Holy
Grail product to me right now so I'm
just going to take this over the top of
the line ah yes I love it and I'm just
going to do a second layer of it just so
it's super pigmented okay so the glitter
liner gently work out how I wanted it to
because we've got a quart of
eyes and it's transferred up here I just
had to scratch it off and it's not
working so we're just going to make do
with it and move on to the next thing
because not everything works out when
you try over the first time oh yeah
moving on to the face I'm just going to
take a Neutrogena
makeup wipe Allah and I'm just going to
wipe away all the fallout ah back you
know everything else to up how am I
gonna fix this shitty dick
I literally just lost half my wing and
it went all the way out there like I
don't
I'm not here for this back I'm just
going to get my eyeliner again and try
and just do like a little flick okay
that's fixed to an extent why did I
make that mistake you learn you move on
okay once I've clean up under my eyes
I'm just going to move into primer and
today I'm gonna be using my professional
I have not used this in so long and I
don't know why because I am obsessed
with this primer it is so good
it literally blurs your skin and fills
in your paws to the absolute best of any
primate ability to ever exist
moving on to foundation I'm going to be
using the lemare the soft fluid liquid
foundation now I know this isn't very
practical to use but I spend $300 on it
and I kind of want to use it in the
video so here we go my thoughts on this
foundation it smells like a rich rich
lady it just smells if you ever have the
chance to smell this please do it
because it smells I don't even know how
to explain the smell of this so I'm just
going to paint this all over my face can
you guys comment some of your favorite
songs at the moment down below because
like the new songs like new really good
songs
I'm intellect so many different like
genres of music but like I want to know
more Oh guys you know what you know I
think killing me the past few days
seeing everyone at Coachella
like to pass the weight seeing everyone
at Coachella it's killing me it's my
goal to go to Coachella next year and
I'm going to make it happen so I'm just
taking my Beauty Blender and going to
town I'm blending this out I blend up so
nicely and I would say it's got pretty
much full coverage like almost full
coverage but it applies to the skin it
really really well okay so I was looking
pretty blended in then CLR I
mean I don't want to shock anyone but
I'm going to be using the kite shape
tape and chin nose Cupid's bow and
forehead and then I'm going to take my
Beauty Blender and blend this up
okay once that's all blended I'm just
going to go straight in on underneath of
my eyes just a little bit of concealer
just a tiny bit of concealer today and
then just blending this out with my
Beauty Blender
okay once my under-eye concealer is all
blended out and then going to move in to
baking and I'm going to be trying the
dermablend professional setting powder I
think the stuff in Priceline as I said
earlier and it was I think sixty
Australian dollars fifty nine dollars so
I'm really intrigued to see how this
goes if it's better than the Aussie or
the Cote and I'm going to bake my whole
nose always always always do I don't
know why I do it I just do and then I'm
just going to bake the other areas where
I put concealer
oh my God look underneath this better
not have flashback otherwise we're going
to have some issues dermablend and I'm
just going to use that same powder to
set the rest of my foundation just to
cutting motions that is set now let's
finish off underneath my items going to
zoom you guys in once again okay I'm
just going to do pretty much what I do
on top of my eyes exactly the same
underneath so just adding a bit of
sandalwood right underneath my lower
lash line just to keep it nice and smoky
and then I'm going to go straight in
with black truffle straight under my
lower lash line
and then just going in with cocoa and
blending that black out and then just
underneath that a little bit more
sandalwood just to blend those two
colors out okay I'm just going to do the
site and I'll be right back okay now
that my eyes are Dunham is going to dust
off my under-eye baked coming off really
nicely there's no like white cast or
anything underneath okay so I'm a star
today I'm going to be using the benefit
roller lash I have not used this since
it came out
holy I love it this mascara but you
know how you going through different
phases a different makeup and then you
like find it again you're like holy
like this is so good
this is one of those things now for my
lashes I'm going to be using the jamila
lashes these do not have a name on them
but they are one of my favorite all-time
one of my all-time favorite lash brands
are now getting straight into conference
and take
Todd Park Avenue princess contour on the
morphe r14 brush this is my favorite
brush stroke contouring atm
so I'm yeah just just like y'all know
I'm just gonna go straight in on these
cheeks
under the jawline will kind of make one
I can't wait to get a hair transplant
one day I'm going to make this apply
head so small at my hairline
balls that really start at the top of my
eyebrows because my forehead just pisses
me off so much just one of those things
you know you know how we all want what
we can't have yeah that's me now I'm
going to contour my nose slightly and
just kind of bring it back because I've
got very very very lost and all that
concealer so just on a small little
blender brush I'm just going to run some
of this Park out-of-print so it's down
the sides and blend as I go not really
too harsh because if I contour my nose
too much it just looks stupid you know
what I mean oh okay now to bronze
because I don't have enough bronzer on
my face as per usual so I'm going to
take my Marc Jacobs tantrika bronze I
just on my benefit bronzing brush and
bring these cheeks back to life dad
in honor of Chris yeah go go go go go go
yeah I'm just going to bronze all down
my neck too so everything matches
because nothing's ever exactly how you
want it or nothing's ever the exact same
color what maybe sometimes but not with
me thank you
after we've bronzed the absolute
shit-ton out of my face I'm just going
to take this blush from the balm this is
called balm Beach I guess and it's like
a nice little pinky shade so I'm just
going to go to town on my cheeks with
this and this is not very pigmented
which is good because that's what you
want with blushes so you can just you
know add it slowly in too intense if you
brush your blush on forward it looks so
much better I don't know why and I
forget where I learnt that but okay this
is just not pigmented enough come on
 show up give me something now to
put on my waterline I'm just going to
take the tart in a rim liner and I'm
just going to pop that on the waterline
just because there's so much black going
on around my face I kind of want to open
my eyes up a little bit now it's going
to spritz my face a little bit of the
Kat Von D and then I'm so excited
because I'm going to go straight in with
the fruit of beauty
3
highlighter palette who really sent this
to me the other day so thank you so
 much like a look at this so I'm
keen to see how it applies to the face
so I think I'm just going to take a
little bit of this shade here okay so I
need to wet my brush definitely I don't
really like wetting my brush because I
feel like the highlighter goes cakey but
just gonna do it justice ones I was
expecting a little bit more of like a oh
my god but I didn't really get that hmm
thank you sure about this one you guys
like it looks good on camera but it's
not applying the best ah okay I'm really
not understood - a little bit of my
Cupid's bow actually a bit disappointed
in this highlighter palette it's not up
to my art for standards because you guys
know how I love Oprah I love Oprah
highlighters but never said I hate it I
don't hate it I'm definitely gonna give
it another shot in another video and
give it like a second go maybe it's just
not working today because sometimes
things just don't work out late what
okay moving on to my lips I'm just going
to take this lip liner from Mac it is in
the style shade stripped down just need
to find my sharpen because it's blunt as
 so I literally cannot find my
sharpener anywhere and all my lip
planners a blunt as so I'm just go
starting with the lipstick now today I'm
going to be trying at the Laura Lee
slash Mac collaboration aisle extenders
in the pros the other day so
congratulations to Laura on this it
smells so good and it's such a pretty
nude I haven't put on my lips yet but I
did swatch it on my hand so I'm yeah I'm
just gonna wait I need to clean my lips
a little bit this crusty-ass foundation
okay so this is the Laura Lee a 27 I
don't know a 27 anything to do with it
but it's the Laura Lee collapse oh yeah
the consistency is amazing okay I'm so
impressed with this lip color it is
literally the most perfect nude ever
shook I'm sure the and now to
finish off my brows I'm just going to
take a benefit - gimme brow and this is
just going to tint the hairs and just
get all like the powder and stuff out of
them and then I was going to take a
little bit of the a thousand our eyebrow
gel mascara this mixture brows and
not move or for
nay and I'm brushing them up to give
that feathery look again because I love
that at the moment I'm sorry happy with
this lip color it just makes me so happy
when youtubers get to collaborate with
big makeup brands it's just it's just
crazy like the power of social media I
just still blows my mind to this day
just look color is everything maybe I'm
gonna give liquid lipsticks a break for
a while I'm just gonna put a little bit
more on because it's so nice I didn't
even need this planner with this look at
all anyways then I'm going to set my
whole entire face with the Kat Von D and
makeup setting mist
