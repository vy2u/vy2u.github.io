hello guys welcome back to my channel I
heard girl join super super well sir I
have literally just landed off the plane
from Melbourne I've literally been
travelling everywhere lately and I'm
just so done with flying I'm just over
it I'm a hundred percent done I don't
want to go anywhere until I have to go
to America which is in September so I'm
just done with flying and I'm over done
with flying by myself too I hate flying
by myself it gives me anxiety
today I'm going to be doing my makeup
and just talking to you guys about some
products about my life what's been going
on lately bit of a chitchat get ready
with me and I like the old style sort of
Izzy's do all the way back in
the bottle you know what I'm saying so I
do have some new makeup products that
I've got to try out because I wanted to
shinies and rated her makeup room like I
always do so yeah let's get into it
okay guys they're starting off with my
Isis I'm going to be taking D a benefit
Boing concealers in the shade at number
one so it's the lightest shade and I'm
sure the fact that I'm not using top
shape Jake but you know I gotta change
it up a little bit every now and again
because not everyone wants hardship
taken you know what the am i doing
I haven't even done my eyebrows yet so
for my bath today I'm going to be taking
the benefits to brow this is in the
shade of a furry I'm going to take a
little baby angled brush and I'm just
going to kind of fill in these babies so
I'm just kind of filling in the natural
shape with the kibriya okay once they
filled in pretty much to how I want them
I'm just going to take that brush just
kind of flick up a little bit just like
kind of blend it all out if that makes
sense just looking up the BOK looking oh
you know okay perfect let's move onto my
shadow
okay guys going back to their benefit
Boing concealer I'm gonna take that on a
synthetic flat brush and I'm just going
to kind of cut out the bottom of my brow
I'm just kind of dragging is that
concealer down yeah I come from this
world got wet the Beauty Blender
be happy guys okay now I'm going to take
that concealer and just pop it straight
over my entire eyelid area we're going
to do my stuff the block yeah kind of
stuck yeah then I'm just going to take
my data sponge this is the morphe one
and I'm just going to blend out all this
concealer now to set that in place I'm
going to be trying to cut 1g locket
translucent powder and more or less just
a little
product on adding a little bit more
powder because why the not been you
know so guys pretty much know how these
videos go when I'm doing my eyes I don't
talk about myself a lot of what's been
going on I talk about the products
because I'm concentrating and I want to
do something a little bit different
today and then when I do my face I talk
about everything thing going on so do
you want to get to the face go for it
but it's not let's do the eyes okay what
the did this powder just do to my
eyes it literally just turned white in
my little crease are you actually
serious okay so for my eyes today I'm
going to be going in with this Oprah or
Pro palette so these are the must-have
matte eyeshadows I'm just going to show
you guys else what they look like in
here and I'm going to dig into these two
purple shades at the top since I can do
something a little bit different you
know always doing the saurian shades and
the warm Browns that runs like I can do
something different for a change I'm
like I do but I actually died so today
I'm actually going to do that minute one
time through the crease big guy see how
this goes it's always scary using the
eyeshadows I've never used a shadows
from over in my life I love Oprah as a
brand I think I have amazing products
especially their highlighters oh my god
best highlighters in the literal world
so more or less just blending that all
throughout the crease and kind of
blending it up because this is going to
be the transition color for today going
with more products and passing that on
bucket so windy outside seriously it's
gonna blow anything off my balcony
 blow binky onto my balcony
because I can't get it right now
the other supposed to like some rail
when I'm like craving her coals okay
we're going on the right track for a
black eye okay so I'm just adding a lot
of this product and it's building up so
sorry nicely I'm just having to blend
for a while because obviously like
purple I'm sure is one of those really
hard sort of college to work with my air
conditioners doesn't show the I'm
actually going to die now I'm going to
dip into that a darker purple that was
in that same color see how this goes
with this one
nice sad blending so well these
eyeshadows are actually so freakin good
are you serious okay now I'm going to
take the black eyeshadow it was scary
out of this palette and
get onto my outer-v and kind of bring it
up a little bit up here kind of just let
it chill on the outside of the eye you
know for me it's going to kind of hang
out there by itself for a bit as we take
a little bit more of that purple shade -
danke Wan and I'm just going to blend
the black up
that's my eyelid color today I'm going
to be taking the Julius place masquerade
palette and I'm gonna be taking I'm
pretty sure let's take I'm going to be
taking so just shade your called MIDI
car MIDI cooler may take away away away
away away away from the Papas all over
the lid area and kind of blend it into
that black on the out of V you know I'm
saying okay now I'm going to change it
up a little bit and I'm going to be
taking the top rogue little liner put
coucher it's got two shades got two
sides to it so that this one and there's
the glitter part so I'm assuming at this
part goes downstairs now I have not used
it so awesome a little bit nervous so
I'm going to just kind of go in quiet
and can totally know what I think this
just yeah
okay now that that is all dry I'm just
going to go straight over the top of it
with glitter sigh so it's definitely not
as pigmented and like as intense as I
thought it was going to be this glitter
it's just kind of looks the same as the
thing that I just first put down but
it's still cute now for masks are today
I'm going to pop on fuzzy tree face it
better than dick litter there that's
scary as it is I'm gonna publish
straight over the top now for my lashes
these are by a brand called lash
warriors I'm gonna pop these straight on
my eyes how they normally go you know
okay I'm just gonna pop these lashes
straight on okay guys but now that my
lashes are let's get started on my face
so I'm gonna be taking the Tarte clean
slate timeless smoothing primer okay so
what the has been going on with me
lately
let's just make sure this microphone is
working in my air conditioner isn't
being too loud so as I said
inside of the video I just got back from
Melbourne for my friend's 20th birthday
it was so fun
I'm just so glad to be home now because
I've been traveling so much lately it's
like flying around everywhere like
there's like a little beat just look
just like a bird or just things flying
around sky every week by
the fields of it so I literally
have okay so my foundation I'm going to
be
the alligator coverage foundations is in
the shape fair
um so has been pretty crazy for me
lately I am I don't know I just have a
lot going on like in my personal life
and I'm kind of over a lot of things I'm
 over having to worry about it's
like hard to explain just like from an
outsider's perspective it doesn't really
make sense but I find it so hard to I
find it so hard to talk to people who I
don't even know how to word is without
sounding cocky I find it so hard to talk
to new people because I don't know what
their intentions ever are with me do you
know what I mean like I just don't you
just never know what someone wants from
me and like I don't know I'm a very kind
person like I'm very loving and I'm very
caring and I like to help people out a
lot that can get in the way of a lot of
things it's just hard like I
don't know you just don't know what
people want from you you don't know if
they want followers they don't know if
they they want your money like just sort
of annoying like some days I
love social media and other days I
 can't stand it but in saying
dark
I'm so lucky to have every
single one of you guys sometimes it's
just like too much especially with
friends and that like it's so hard to
like making new friends and like
that you just don't know what people's
intentions are it's just going to sound
really cocky like super cocky and I
don't know why I'm saying it but it's so
much easier to make friends with people
who were who are already on your level
does that make sense like I don't want
that to come across as rude and I know
people are probably going to twist that
and hate me for it which is fine but if
you're sitting in my shoes if you're in
my shoes you would know what I mean like
it's just it's just easier and like you
just don't have to worry like like what
are they going to gain from me like oh I
don't know just talk my head in
sometimes okay moving on to concealer
I'm going to be trying to eat cosmetics
bye bye under-eye I was actually given
that this concealer at my meetup by the
official she was the social media
manager or the owner not the owner
something to do with it cosmetics the
brand itself and she gave me these
under-eye concealers to try out I'm so
excited because I've seen people use
these literally for so long so let's
give it a shot
can I highlight with this I'm gonna try
I don't
bye-bye under-eye meaning for your eyes
specifically but I'm break the rules
done I'm gonna take a little bit of a
Mac prep and Prime fixed plus just on my
face just what the not oh wow okay
this is definitely thick AF
well this concealers actually that good
like so good okay now I'm going to take
it on my under eyes we're bringing it
under here now once that's all set down
I'm just going to take this sponge again
and just go to town this is definitely
highlighting and concealing the absolute
 out of my under eyes which is
amazing now there's no way in how I'm
going to be using the Kat Von D setting
powder again afterwards it literally
just went too weird on my eyelids so I'm
gonna take my courteous bun and set and
bake underneath my eyes because it
literally never lets me down besides the
packaging it's fast it's literally going
everywhere right now that's a problem
that cannot buy socks Jenna yeah
I have kind of stopped so I'm just gonna
bake oh my oh my god there's how to
it everywhere now to set the rest of my
foundations gonna take the Milani
compact powder foundation this is in the
shade zero one shell and I'm just going
to set everything else on my face so it
does not move just to finish off the
under items going to take the Julius
place a nice gray palette once again and
I'm just going to take the shade in here
called zobo which is this pinky purpley
shade straight onto the lash line siga
make sure that's fully blend it out I'm
just going to really pick the color in
on in there and was kind of fading out
back out of shadow just into my under
eye just kind of blending down really
nicely actually now to taking the to
face better than wall that was almost
really bad taking the Too Faced better
than sex
straight up on it under here now to
contour my face a little bit I'm going
to be taking the urban decay and naked
skin that shapeshifter palette now this
palettes got two sides it's got the
powder and then on this side it's got
the cream but it's not opening in my
copy but so figure for it later
alright so I'm going to take this shade
it just here just a little bit top it
off
Oh God ah a duck bendy this is all
her fault and I'm gonna see if I can
blend this out because that was just so
intense like so intense actually guys
this is blending up super well I think
it's going to be okay okay I'm not
really a fan as the shapeshifter palette
so I'm just going to dip into my benefit
hoola because it always saves the little
day I'm just going to slightly contour
my jawline actually a lot so I can't
actually find a new bronzer to try out
so I'm gonna take my Milani exile
although the glow I'm just going to
bronze up my face nicely okay add a
little bit of color to my cheeks I'm
going to be taking the Ofra blush in the
shade Bellini this is a a new blushes
just come out haven't tried them yet so
let's give it a whirl gonna dip in a
little bit not too powdery which is good
Q that's added such a nice slushy color
and it's not too intense I like it a lot
now before we highlight I'm just going
to spritz and I'm not I'm not going to
do it because I know my highlighter
always goes chunky when I do it now I
have actually not tried these Apple in
my actual life this is the Kylie
cosmetics press illuminating powder in
French vanilla so it's a highlighter I
guess not a problem okay so I'm just
gonna hope the net looks good
okay so I haven't spread my face at all
and I'm just going to take my other star
CIA 23 brush my camera just cut out and
I don't know when it cut out but I'm
just applying the highlighter and I
didn't spray my face and I'm so
impressed do people talk about these I
haven't really seen anyone talk about
them maybe their moments passed you know
how like something's really popular and
then it just drops off the face
of the earth
see Jack doesn't to be here anymore I
think that looks so nice just adding
more to the middle part cute I love this
and it's got a little bit to the tip of
my nose my bridge I'm overall or bit too
much never really impressive this
highlighter what the it's actually
good I'm just gonna take a little bit on
a smaller brush and just pop it onto my
inner corners because I've been taking
that look lately Hey
I love it now for my lip color today I'm
going to be trying D to face melted a
latex high shine liquefied lipstick I
don't understand a whole latex part of
it I think it smells like latex okay so
it's
such a thick consistency I don't know if
I like it okay honestly I really do not
like the feeling of this I love to face
I love it from their products as this is
just it's like it's not even high shine
it's like matte almost I don't know I
don't know what to think of that I'm not
going to say that I officially hate it
yet because I need to try out more
colors and obviously wear it for a while
and see how it wears but I'll let you
know how it goes in another video okay
guys now I'm just going to set
everything in place using the next Joey
finish a long-lasting and makeup setting
spray there we go anyway guys this is
