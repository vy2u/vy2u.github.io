as an eye they stay on my eyelids with
and I'm going to just cut out the bottom
of this brown honey 600 flat flat oh my
god if you guys live in Brisbane I don't

just a Brisbane ting it's like a
Melbourne thing or - I think um FOMO

actually done with laughs I'm so excited
to see congratulations go flex right I
have a son I just think congratulations
is literally the best song ever and it
just shits on every single song let's
come out this year so far I'm beyond
obsessed that just started playing in
the clubs which is amazing cuz when it
comes on at Soho I'm behind those DJ
decks I see a lot of you guys not
chatting behind the DJ decks because if
I'm behind the DJ decks I'm normally a
really really drunk you know I'm just
gonna paint this all across my lid I
haven't any uses as I face before I
don't think I see jar use it all the
time make up a jar legendary makeup
artist see ya so I base I think it's
this concealer but how many's in such a
long time so we'll just see how it goes
and guess who remember to wet their
Beauty Blender today this guy right here
bindis uncle thank you to set my eyelids
in place today I'm just going to take
the Milani powder foundation and just go
over that and set this so it don't
crease we don't want anything creasing
unless it's a cut crease honey you live
yes oh by the way I'm really sorry about
this it's so ugly to look at I'm Shani
decided to hit me and literally bend my
nail back to the root last night so
that's definitely a problem that cannot
be fixed until it's healed which is
going to take like six weeks and I
literally my pinky finger here
everyone's like oh you missing it now
no that was went back to the root as
well so bye so I have to deal with that
I mean there's people in much worse
situations than me I need to stop
talking about a nail but
seriously every time I think about it it
starts robbing and it's really painful
okay now that my early base is down
that's gone into eyeshadow so my
eyeshadow today I'm going to be using
none other than the jaclyn hill morphe
palette literally obsessed with this and
it sold out again i think it was on sale
yesterday and it just sold out very very
quickly again now I have no idea what
I'm doing with my eye look today so I'm
just going to hope to the best and just
see what happens so
I want to kind of do it really really
dramatic so I'm going to kind of start
up here like all the way up here all out
there but man and then I'm going to
start popping it for my creeley's I'm
going have it said that about ten
 years what's going on there Ben
oh my god sort of invented literally by
like Seger it's gonna zoom you guys in a
little bit more so wrong way so that we
go now we're working this okay I'm gonna
just talk about my makeup for a bit and
then we'll talk about later chitchat
stuff when I get onto my face just so I
can concentrate because I literally have
no idea what I'm doing but I just want
to make it you know work I want to make
it look good okay now I'm going to take
this darker orange shade and I'm going
to start building it up on the out of
vmi by quite far out actually like
literally all the way up there that's
probably too far this could be a problem
that cannot be fast I'm gonna just blend
that out see ya flip out there well what
we're going right out our way okay
did I just lose my transition I think I
did by transitions back that's not our
problem just gonna keep building that
off you guys probably like oh my god is
doing orange eyeshadow again guys it's a
festival look I'm obsessed with orange
eyeshadow for festival thinking okay I'm
just going to blend that all out with
this fluffy brush yeah the brushes I'm
using today are all from pretty much EXO
beauty and morphe they kind of the only
blending brushes I use oh and it's all
about makeup now I'm going to take that
just burgundy sort of shade and I'm
going to see if I can darken my outer-v
more and I'm going to kind of take some
black and kind of pop that in my outer V
and I'm gonna bring it all up for my
Cree that looks a mess right now but
don't worry we're going to blend it out
we're going to make it black okay now
I'm just going to go over the edges of
that black
Curtis Lee doesn't blend away so I was
going to keep busting out that black
until it's fully like blended out I was
very intense but lack Gorge
okay now I'm going to be doing like a
little bit of a cut crease sort of thing
so I'm going to be taking V a benefit of
Blanc and Dallas is one of my favorite
concealers at the moment so I'm just
going to dip in just a little angle
brush to kinda come for crease you know
just cut it up scissors why not you know
go straight up on in here
oh my god this is so scary okay so once
that crisis kind of copped out a little
bit it doesn't have to be perfect cuz
we're going to go over it with like
eyeshadow anyways third oil okay so I'm
pretty one happy with how that's looking
sort of far so it's gonna leave that at
that
then I'm going to take the morphe ice
shadow this is the radio dry pressed
pigment if you guys haven't tried these
you need to get on some that actually
that good alright so I'm going to take
that pigment and just pop that more so
all over my lid oh my god that deodorant
smells so good I'm getting it what is
that oh that's interior ends it no
started not snarfing antiperspirant
deodorant did you know that I only found
out the other day that links body sprays
aren't deodorants there's just a body
spray I've been using my whole life and
wondering why it doesn't work yeah how
 is that alright so then I was
going to take this smaller brush that
I've got here and just pack on the
pigment closer to where all of that
concealer goes and because I do have
other guys that will you know get a
little bit messy up there but bad but
like that's life isn't it can't do much
about my little it time then what I'm
going to do is to take some more of that
orange like dark brown eyeshadow and
kind of put onto my outer-v and just
blend in the sides so it's nice and like
okay now I'm going to take a little bit
of this steal a smoky storm glitch our
stuff and oh it's completely different
color to play expected that's definitely
a problem I'm just going to put that on
my inner corners here and I'm going to
put some on the back of my hand so I can
use a little brush and get really right
up in that layer so I want to get all up
in here be honest I just covered up all
the hard work up and Dan okay guys so if
you're watching this tutorial don't even
during the concealer and eye shadow cuz
well see ya
and it definitely blends in nicely to
the eyeshadow and stuff that I put
underneath but like let's just leave it
at this you know perfect I'm just gonna
let that dry and I will be back in a
minute now he's going to take the Inglot
gel liner and I'm just going to kind of
go across my lash line I'm not going to
do a wing should I
nah what's that ladder is down I was
going to take a little angled brush and
kind of get some black eyeshadow and
just kind of
get out the tiniest little bit so it's
not a straight line you know for my
mascara today I'm just gonna be using
the Urban Decay perversion mascara so
I'm just gonna whack this on since these
are the lashes I'm using today once
again I have no idea what they are
because they're at the bottom of my lash
case I'm trying to use up all the lashes
that just like just sit in there and do
nothing
alright so I'm going to take a new trio
G Nuala makeup white glue and just clean
up the edges can sort of wipe over my
whole face because why not
moving on to primer I'm going to be
taking the benefit Porefessional matte
rescue parameters like that green gel
love this stuff so much and I'm just
going to pop that all over my face
DeBlase for my foundation today I'm
going to be taking the Lancome TNI doll
GN idol ultra where 24 hours this is in
the shade
0:05 for those who want to know take a
random paddle brush and just go to town
you know this foundation is everything
like everything I've been sick - I've
been sick for a while on and off sick
like all my friends have been sick and
I've just been around sick people so it
seems like oh my god am I going to get
sick again but I feel completely better
now which is perfect just in time for
splendor and I'm gonna be wearing makeup
sorry Matt over the next few days so
it's been kind of good to kind of have
like a bit of a break like with makeup
because my skin's cleared up so much but
now that I'm going to be wearing it so
many days straight in a row I'm probably
going to break out heaps but whatever
that's just life isn't it ok now I'm
going to take my identity blender and
just go to town on my skin and blend all
this foundation out well oh it's got my
head on today what do you guys think all
back to blonde again because well that's
just the way I like it the most and
that's how all my friends like it I'd
say it looks better but I agree it does
my forehead looks really red because as
you as I just told you guys my hair up
leech today so my scalp is a little bit
Dalek at the moment I'm just about to
paint a ton of chemicals onto it
but you know that's just life so I'm
just going to start blending this all
into my hairline try not to get it into
my hair because it literally will go
yellow and that is going to be a very
big problem that cut off a fox because
once it's in there you're for my
concealer again I'm going to take some
more of that Boyne conceal if I'd Venice
there
it I'm going to highlight my face I'm
just going to put a little bit up around
my hairline as well because it is
extremely red at the moment oh by the
way guys we've got a really important

Dacians going to go back to that Milani
compact foundation powder and just set
everything else on my face so it does

around like crazy drinking and you don't
want anything to move to in a bindi no
