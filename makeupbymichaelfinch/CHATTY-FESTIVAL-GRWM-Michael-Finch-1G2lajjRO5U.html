channel so today I thought I'd sit down
chapter everyone and drew kind of like a
festival get ready with me now I really
wish I could say that I was actually
going to a festival but I'm not but I
said like everyone's just doing tests of
all looks lately so I feel like I'm as
well just joining on behind you know
what I mean so I'm just gonna be playing
with some products and just kind of like
doing my makeup and just chatting to you
guys so let's get straight into it
I'm just going to zoom the guys in
because we are going to start off with
my eyes as per usual okay now that I
have you guys nice and close let's get
started on the eyes so first of all I'm
just going to be taking the Tarte shape
type concealer you know I don't know
what that was to be honest I have no
idea but I'm going to prime the out
of my lids with the Tarte shaped a
alright so I'm just taking that tight
shape tape all over my eyelid dispersing
the product evenly now it's going to
take my damp Beauty Blender as usual and
go to town on these lids
okay then what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to dip into my Australis
fresh and flawless pressed powder in the
shade light beige just from a brush and
I'm just going to set my lids just so
this will help all the powders blend a
lot better okay now that my lids are all
set let's move on to my favorite part
eyes shadow everything on my desk is
literally a mess oh by the way if you
guys hear like any loud bangs or
crackling or when I go this is an
example into the microphone it'll
actually like is so bad so I have to be
so careful and I'm normally so reckless
so I'm trying to improve on that cuz a
lot of people are commenting about it so
I'm getting that you know that is not
what i sucking want to give me my
eyeshadow brushes thanks yep alright so
dipping into eyeshadow I'm really taking
the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills Modern
Renaissance palette I have not listened
to this hot baby for such a long time
and it is so sorry messy like just the
shadows all in each other and it's just
one big wish big mess all right
so it's going to take raw sienna and
burnt orange and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to put it in my Anna beam you
know and just kinda go like this I don't
know what this is going to look like I
really do not even know what look I'm
going for
I'm kind of just hoping it'll be like
rather festive Lee do you know what I
mean just kind of blending that harsh
edge yeah I just want it to be like
super duper dramatic to not I mean all
right so once s through the crazies and
then just going to dip into the shade
called let's go English some love letter
which is this beautiful pink color and
I'm just going to take a love letter and
just pop it on my outer V and then I'm
going to smoke it upwards so up like
DEA's lack beers lack leaves
speaking of lack Diaz I'm going to New
Zealand next week and it's my first time
flying internationally so I'm wishing
you luck everything should be fine I'm
flying with our Emirates so I think I
get free Wi-Fi which is awesome so I can
like you know edit upload reply to
comments post Instagram photos post
snapchat you know so that should be
great and I hope I don't have to pay
extra because my plane tickets are
 expensive you know I'm just
going to take some more of that brown
shade and I'm going to blend out a love
letter but I do want to bring the love
letter up a little bit higher because I
do have footed eyes and I like to bring
all my shadows up higher so you can see
them more as I said I have no idea what
I'm doing so let's just go with it we're
going to make it work that's my motto
make it work and work with what you've
got
that's my motto for everybody out there
work with what you've got now I'm going
to take a little bit of red oak R and
I'm going to kind of pop that on man out
of V and kind of flick it out into like
a wing I guess no idea what I'm doing
thank you so today is actually e star
good but not Easter fighter its Good
Friday and basically what they do I
don't know if they do it everywhere but
in little country towns they get like
the fire brigade people to go around and
they collect money for the Good Friday
peel which is basically just to raise
money for the Good Friday peel there's
been going around all morning and my mom
is off with her sister probably I know
what they're doing probably making
little Easter cupcakes or something
because that's what they do I love them
so much I love my mom she is like one of
the women
that I'll clearly only have a love in
this world like fully lack in love lack
I'm obsessed with you bitch like stop
and you guys know I'm moving very soon
and I do need to do a video with my mum
before I go because I know you got I
know how much you guys love my mum
so that'll that's definitely on the
charts before I drove so look out for
that alright so I'm just going to take
any black eyeshadow the one I'm using is
from the huda beauty palette I swear by
it and I'm just going to put that on my
outer V and just across kind of like
they're there and kind of just flicking
it down using a heavy hand when I'm on
the out of 8 and then Lata as I flick
out I'm just blending over that with a
little bit more of love let up ok now
moving on cure my eyeshadow I kind of
want to do like a bit of a cut crease or
I'm going to take the Engler acrostic I
shadow in the number 17 I believe
alright and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to kind of do like a semi sort of
cut crease but I want it to be like a
high higher cut crease if that makes
sense ok this is the look like on floor
so I'm just going to paint that all
across I mean just with this little
brush yeah this is the it's got no name
on it and I'm going to just kind of
flick that across into my eyeshadow just
so it kind of blends that's so different
I like it I haven't done anything a lot
like this before
I'm just going to do a little bit more
too so it's a little bit more opaque
okay so straight over the top of that I
am just going to put these still a rose
gold retro liquid eyeshadow now I did
use these a cream shadows the other day
I was like playing with makeup and they
did crease a lot and I really didn't
like that so I don't know if it's going
to happen today or not but I'm just
gonna take a little bit of rose gold
retro from misty alive magnificent
metals glitter eyeshadow collection and
I'm more or less just going to pop the
over the top which kind of defeats the
purpose of the purple that I've just put
down but I'm kind of not going to put it
to the edge just over the top this was a
little bit of like gulp it up I guess
and that's a nice transition it goes on
like purple to pink I'm just going to
take that over call I really like this
you know sometimes we need to start
planning your looks out it just goes the
complete opposite way
but it's a good thing do you not I mean
alright so just over the edges of that
shadow I'm just going to Pat over some a
love-letter just to blend the two in
together and it's blending very nicely
I'm really happy with how this has
turned out don't speak too soon too soon
don't speak too soon next minute money
contour I think key okay for my eyeliner
today I'm just going to take the Inglot
gel liner in the number 77 and I got a
newbie because my other one will
actually dry it out and look like a
crack I don't even know I'm just going
to start doing a wing and I'm literally
doing the wing all the way to the tail
of my brow that wasn't my intention but
it's in glut gel liner and if you
it up you know there's no going back
so I'm wish me luck thinking I've not
done a sick wing like this in ages
English eyeliner is literally just like
everything I thought my good wing days
were over but I'm pretty impressed with
this wing I'm just going to do my other
one and I'll be right back okay so for
primer I'm going to use the Too Faced
primed and poreless skin smoothing face
primer and honestly I think this is
almost identical to the benefit
Porefessional it feels the same it
literally looks the same so um yeah my
just go to town and like when you apply
it to your skin it feels exactly like
benefit professional okay so my
foundation today I'm going to be mixing
the alone comb TN adul ultra wear and
the Giorgio Armani women is silk because
it's my favorite combo and I looked in
my foundation row and was like I just
have to do it like one more time and
then I'll give it a break for a while
I hope because I'm just obsessed with
this combo okay that I'm just gonna go
to town these two foundations mix
together smell good oh by the way if
you're still watching at this point
which kudos to you if you are comment
down below where you're from I really
want to know where you're from because
it interested me so much I know there's
people in America and like the
Netherlands Australia New Zealand like
there's people everywhere I want to know
where everyone's from so leave a comment
down below of where you're from blending
this out is my favorite thing ever I
just take a little bit more off my hand
on the Beauty Blender so doesn't
take the product off oh my god you know
what I haven't used in a very long time
the Marc Jacobs remarkable I don't know
I don't know why I just haven't I've
just changed my foundations up I still
love it and I will use it again but I'm
just digging this combo at the moment I
did get some chick-fil-a the other day
from my cosmetic nurse and said to say I
think I'm going to be able says can you
see that little ditch this just in there
apparently it takes about a month to see
full results but already obsessed I only
got a little bit question I think it was
half a mil in each side it just kind of
like brings it up a little bit and I
don't know if you guys can see a
difference but I see is the biggest
difference ever and I know it's going to
be like addictive without clothes so I'm
just blending that all out on my
forehead for some reason I don't know
why I do it but I like to do the lower
half of my face first and foundation it
and then I blend it all out and then I
do the top half I think I'm just scared
of it drying maybe okay now for
concealer I'm just going to use my Tarte
and on my chin Cupid's bow nose bridge
and forehead this will highlight my face
and it will also give it some more light
so I will give you kind of like a
contoured highlighted look and I'm just
going to blend that up with my damn
booty blender and yes it is damp because
I actually remembered to wet it before I
started filming which is just awesome
I'm going to see if I can not use too
much concealer today let's see if we can
do that and then just leave it at that
because I use very much of this
like so much let's see how we go with
that I'll probably add more to be honest
but whatever another thing I wanted to
touch on was um myself so I've been
eating really healthy the past few
months I'm not on a diet as such I just
decided that I don't want to eat you
know
sorry much junk food because I was
eating so bad like the amount of
that I was putting into my body was
actually gross like KFC everyday um and
I've just come to the conclusion that
it's the only body I've got and I really
need to start taking care of it so yeah
that's I'm gonna start doing taking care
of my body more I'm not on a diet like
if I go out to dinner somewhere or if
I'm drunk
I'll have Mac is like I'm not that's
true
myself because you need to have your you
need to still have like sugar and you
need to have cheat days and stuff like
that otherwise you get those horrible
cravings when I do have a cheat day I
don't feel guilty I feel better because
like normally my cheat days are Sunday
because it's the end of the week and
then I can you know start off afresh
week you know all good but yeah I've
been doing we were my best friends and
we're doing really well at the moment I
haven't really been exercising because
this is probably a really poor excuse
but I literally just don't have time
like I've got so much on and you know
pre-filming I'm going to New Zealand
I'll be in Melbourne next week or this
week this video will be out this week so
I'll be in Melbourne when you see this
video so yeah it's all about
self-control and that's what I struggle
with I struggle with self-control for
years and if I can do this anyone can do
it because I am the most stubborn person
when it comes to food and I've had this
complete change in mine and I know that
I've tragedy this before and I've been
set in the mindset that I'm not going to
do it for long but this time it's like
official like I'm telling you guys now
you guys are my motivation also a lot of
people have been commenting on my videos
have you lost weight yes I have I like
to think I haven't lost much I don't
really know I'm not one to believe in
scales because scales are just
and I just like to see it on myself
rather than a number do you not I mean
okay where the actual is my RCM a
powder I literally just had it in my
hands two seconds ago as predicted I'm
just going to take a little bit more of
the touch tape tape just under these
little parts of my is okay now just
dipping into my RCM a cat I'm just going
to take a super generous amount and I'm
just going to plaster that underneath in
my eyes I'm just going to kind of bring
it down onto my cheek just because I
want to be super highlighted and matte
and then I'm just going to take it all
over my nose like I always do and then
for the rest of my face I'm just going
to take the Australia's depression
flawless in the shade light beige
because that's what I do every video and
I'm sure you guys think of it but I fix
it if it's not broke you know what I
mean and I'm just going to Pat that all
over the rest of my skin which is just
going to lock all of my foundation in
place all day
okay so to contour I'm just obviously
going to take color by it and I'm just
going to go straight underneath or like
on my cheekbones now as I was saying
earlier because I have had filler it's a
little bit easier to contour and I
really like that because especially the
sides easier the contour because of what
it sound this slide is so hard to
contour for some reason like you know
you have like you have a good side of
your face when you have a bad side well
this was my bad side but now I think
it's pretty good when I was younger I
used to practice doing makeup on just
this lie so this is my really good eye
for makeup this isn't the best it's
taking a very generous amount onto my
jawline I'm showing to talk a bit more
on my cheeks because why not
okay now I'm just going to take that up
on my forehead and slightly slightly
what kind of contour the
absolute should have my forehead because
I need to okay and then to bronze up my
skin that little bit more I'm just going
to take the Oprah versatile matte
bronzer just on this big-ass wish I'm
just going to kind of go to town with
the bronzer because why not a bit much
okay I just love how you can change your
face with makeup it's like drawing but
on someone's face and I'm going to
bronze all under my jaw line and then
all down my neck so everything much is
up because it's never exact exact you
know for my blush I'm just going to use
the California blush by Jennifer because
it's absolutely stay with me stunning
but I'm just going to kind of put that
on my cheeks and blend it into my
contour okay now it is time to your
highlight which is my favorite part ever
whether hell is my fix plus I don't know
so instead I'm just going to take the
Kat Von D setting mist and now moving on
to my actual highlighter for today I'm
going to use the Nicole Guerrero on a
star see our collaboration glow kit okay
and I'm just going to take the shade oh
I'm really feeling kitty cat up in the
corner it's kind of like a pink pink
shade wonder how it's going to look
absolutely stunning so I'm actually
going to pack the out of my
highlighter on I was going to take a
little bit of forever lip which is this
black shade and kind of just focus it in
the middle and then I'm just going to
take it up her above my brows kind of in
like a triangle shape going down like
that
and kind of just all over my contour so
all blends in together
there's also blend so well but I don't
really go patchy or anything to need to
add a little bit more I don't really
like spraying my brush because that's
what I feel like highlighters tend to go
patchy so I try to avoid spraying my
brush I just spray my face and I'm going
to drive like two point two seconds and
then go to town with the highlighter
okay I'm just going to take the
highlighter on my Cupid's bow it up
cute and then on my nose tip and then
just a little bit along my bridge now so
I'm taking even smaller brush and just
apply a little bit of forever lip right
to the tip it's going to take a little
bit of forever lip which freville it is
the YJ oh my god straight underneath my
brow bone to make it pop and why not a
little bit on the inner corners of my
eyes I am just going to take a little
bit of that RCM a and just kind of like
clean up really slightly actually a lot
underneath my contour give it around 20
seconds and then I'll just wipe it
straight off and it just cleans off
it just cleans that line up a little bit
more so it's more like Deuteronomy and I
love that look okay now I want to do
something a little bit different to my
eyebrows today because why not so I was
going to take benefits 3d brow tones and
I'm going to kind of just brush my brows
all the way up so they're looking really
like feathery giving me natural brow
vibes and natural and brow in the same
settings with me does not normally go so
I'm yes so once all those has a brushed
up and in place and then it's going to
take the thousand our eyebrow mascara
and I'm just going to pop this over
there because what this is going to do
is it's going to help it stay like this
and not move which is exactly what we
need a lot of people won't like this but
I am absolutely living for this right
now moving on to my liquid lipstick
today I'm going to be using the coloured
raine sugar liquid lipstick
I brought a ton of these such a
long time ago and I haven't even like
tested them yet so it's like a beautiful
nude color
I hope this like goes with the look yeah
this is exactly what I wanted like super
super nude and like Gorge this is the
perfect color
it applies really well too and it's not
like you don't have to apply heat delays
to get the color you want okay now that
my lip color is all done I just do want
to add the tiniest little bit of glitter
so I'm just going to take some of the
lip cosmetics a glitter glue stuff you
know I want to put it just in the center
of where my highlighter is on both sides
and the glitter I'm using is called
black snow from stuff i glitters i got
sent a bunch of this stuff ages ago and
it's the only thing they reach for when
i like with glitter and it's going to
pop down it's like green action I'm just
going to put it all over my cheek
because why not oh yeah that's nice like
that's a good area to pop it in okay
cool cool cool cool cool cool
oh my god this lip colors drying it just
keeps getting better and better how nice
is this nude color holy nice a
thank you so for that I'm just going to
take the Inglot across the eyes shadow
in the number 12 it's like a nice Goldy
sort of color and I'm just going to pop
some of that on the back of my hand and
then I'm not going to be able to talk
whilst I do this but I'm going to kind
of create online just like going down
the center in the bottom okay so I guess
it's kind of like a fake sort of lip
ring I don't really know it just kind of
looks so cool so yeah and then to lock
everything in place today I'm just going
to take my Kat Von D a locket makeup
setting mist thank you and this is the
completed and finished look I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
