hey guys welcome back to my channel so I
felt like I haven't sat down and filmed
like a video in so long but I actually
have but I feel like I haven't sat down
and actually just chatted and like
cash-strapped caught up about stuff
that's happened in my life and for
today's gonna be exactly that and today
I'm gonna be revolving this video around
the Anastasia Beverly Hills Modern
Renaissance Renaissance I don't know how
to say it
palette this is star mean check out the
colors are you gagging I am so you can
literally do a million looks with this
palette I don't know what I'm gonna do I
just want to do something like quite
sassy and just like cute and like
dramatic but at the same time not too
dramatic do you not I mean okay so I'm
just gonna start off with my brows and
I'm not gonna say all the products I'm
using I'll leave them all in the
description below soon because I just
wanted to see if I can stay on track
about talking about other stuff rather
than the makeup this time so yeah let's
do so my wink has literally been so
hectic like okay so this was my plan so
today Sunday and you'll see this video
this afternoon hopefully so I decided to
go to Melbourne on Sunday which was last
Sunday but I went Monday instead and
honestly I thought it was gonna be like
the most easiest week everybody honestly
it was so annoying why because
my car decided to itself right of
the earth so I was at Alex and we were
driving through the city going to see
Jamie okay so we're gonna do that as
well like under the West Gate Bridge and
we just like had lunch and we were going
to stop so going to stop like no pun
intended we were like going through the
traffic lights of going through them
 my life I'm sorry about of
explaining things we were stopped at a
traffic light and as soon as because
Alex was driving my car cuz I refused to
drive to the city because I like
stresses me out like anxiety levels stay
up sorry we were stopped at the light
and the light was red so she like
stopped and then I was like about to
film a snapchat video so I turned the
music up and then like the car started
moving and Alex is like oh my god
Michael your car's not working
and
it's funny looking back at it now but it
was literally so scary like apparently
stuff like that happens to Alex all the
time of their car but like it never
really happens to me so I kind of shut
like Loki shut myself I'm just rolling
through and there was oncoming traffic
coming this way
we were just rolling through so luckily
that we were in the right lane because
we have to go in front of this other car
to get to like the side of the road and
like pull oh because my brakes were

so the brakes weren't working to the
boat sails okay um yeah like that's
actually one of my biggest fears and you
know I wasn't there for it I was not
there for it so basically after all that
had happened and I bloke he shot myself
in the passenger seat we obviously
pulled over I called my insurance
company you know how all go they came in
how to look at it they couldn't see what
was wrong and but because it was the
brakes that went working we like legally
weren't allowed to drive it or something
so I was like yet not a problem so I had
to call well actually my insurance
company called a tow truck so this
gorgeous little man rocks up and he's
like it was so so funny like he rocked
up and he was like telling me Alex what
to do like where to stand he's like
you'll they're cool you're there like it
was so funny and then he's like okay you
put this on he mainly put on like a
high-res jacket like one of those
trailer-looking things so you're like
seen whatever more than I time I don't
know what difference were made during
the day and he's like he basically said
okay you stop traffic so I don't get hit
because he has like going onto the road
so I get my car there and he's like you
stop the traffic so I didn't really know
what he was saying so I was in the
middle of the road with this jacket on
my new full face of makeup okay in you
know standing in the mall the road
stopping all this traffic like this is a
lot of traffic that's coming through so
I literally had to stop a traffic and
thank God it was over quickly because I
was having an anxiety attack standing
Road obviously primer is benefits
Porefessional so I totally forget where
I was going with like my whole story
um but yeah basically I've never shot
myself so much in a car like luckily we
were by going down a hill or like on the
freeway so if the foundation I'm gonna
slap her on today but yet anyway
good let's talk about some good things I
went to Melbourne um
hanged out with Alex for like a while
she was really in my house like last
week but I like went back there I was
like we're gonna be so bored
this week I'm coming back to Melbourne I
filmed a video with jRD Jamie Ryan D we
got one for my channel and for his
channel and let me just tell you about
it
so we were filming - it took us 14 13 14
hours right to film two videos so we did
two videos one for these channel one for
mine it should be up within like the
next like week and a half two week if
you have me on snapchat you would have
seen like what the videos were about but
it literally took us so long to film
like it's because we're drinking were
both kind of drunk for like the both
videos so you have excited for you guys
to see those two videos I feel like like
it was a lot of fun to film um and yeah
she's keen for you to see them all so I
honestly wish I had my Jeffrey Stehr
highlighter he opened with Hallett so
excited to film with that but I'm also
really really scared that my King taught
because if you guys have been keeping up
with like just the whole Jeffrey star on
highlighters and whatever King Tut has
been arriving for everyone smashed now
apparently something happened with the
boxes the truck driver like like so many
boxes of King Tut got smashed so
everyone's not everyone but quite a few
people have been getting King Tut
smashed enough like the only shade
that's been smashed as far as I've seen
so I'm kind of scared but he said that
like on his Twitter that everyone will
be getting either a refund or a reason
which is totally fine um but I just
don't really want it like now like it's
not Jeffrey's fault if the highlight is
we smash like I'm not gonna be mad I'm
just gonna be upset because I like
really want it so badly if you guys
don't know Justin Bieber just came out
with a new remix today featuring Jay
Drake so it's one dance Justin Bieber a
week after I finished is makeup look I'm
get on snapchat i'ma just like pop my
ass away to it like it's so good at just

would definitely be an IMAX Lucia in
Sydney so I'm excited to like see people
I'm so excited to meet new people I'm
excited because I just honestly heart
Jeffrey's gonna have his own like booth
there and I would honestly die if I were
starsia and novena Kane like that's just
being like a dream for so long like I
just want to meet a Nastasia and
northing not and normally they kind of
bring some with them like imagine if
