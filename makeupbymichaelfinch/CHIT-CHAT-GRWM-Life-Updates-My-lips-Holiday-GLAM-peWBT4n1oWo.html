feel like it has been a very freaking
long time since I have done a chit chat
CAPTCHA get ready with me I used to do
these every single week and just other
videos took over and I have a lot that I
really want to catch up on and I'm keen
to do my makeup too so let's do it I
just love it when you sit down you think
you've got everything in front of you
but then the first thing you need is
concealer and smile even here first
thing I'm just going to be taking is the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD concealer and
just putting that on my lid area so
what's everybody been doing oh my god I
can't believe it's almost Christmas this
year is going so fast
Oh oh my god Christmas is literally
right around the corner it's actually
this Sunday I think and if you don't
celebrate Christmas then happy holidays
I think that's what you say I'm for
Christmas I was gonna go to Warner ball
but that's not happening anymore I'm
just going to Torquay which is just near
like Melbourne I guess I really know I
haven't really been there before I think
I been there once but I haven't been
there in the past like 60 years before I
get the chance to create I'm just gonna
set up with some Ifrah translucent
powder and I think I've actually used
this one before for my eyes today I'm
going to be using the Kylie Jenner
burgundy palette yes I love this palette
so much I don't really know what look
I'm going for but hopefully it's going
to be something that's like rather
Christmassy you know what I mean I mean
oh and I lost my fix+
somewhere in my travels far isn't that
great years so I'm just going to dip
into this color here oh so anyway as I
was saying before I'm just going to go
to Torquay for Christmas now which
should be nice meant to be near the
beach but over the next five days it's
going to be so freakin hot so I'm
actually kind of scared about that
because I hate the hot weather I just
hate it so much and by the way guys I
just wanted I don't think I've actually
touched on this in a video and maybe I
have I don't know but I'll say it again
I just wanted to say thank you so
freaking much for 200,000 subscribers
that is out of this world I never
thought I would get to even a hundred
thousand this year and that is
so crazy to me and I'm just so so
excited and happy I'm so happy to that
many people enjoy my videos enough to
subscribe and if you watch my videos
actually that was the question that I
want to ask if you guys watch my videos
why do you what like why do you watch my
videos can leave a comment down below
saying why isn't my personality isn't my
eye shape like isn't my face shape
because I know some people only watch
specific people because they have the
same sort of features as them so or do
you like like really full glam looks
that's what I really do on this channel
leave a comment down below because I'm
really really interested now I'm just
going to be going into this middle color
here and I'm just going to make this as
burgundy as I can on the top does anyone
ever believe in like does anyone even
believe in year's resolutions anymore
because I always set them for myself but
I never do them and the fact that I
don't do that makes me sad so I don't
set them for myself anymore because
sometimes I don't hit my goals or reach
my goals or whatever so that's why I'm
not really setting any are all my 1
year's media's resolution is to be moved
out of this town by the middle of next
year that's my resolution and tonight is
much bad food but we all know that's not
going to happen now it's going to take
this sort of like maroon shade over here
and I'm going to put that in and out of
E and just darken up that top area a
little bit now I'm going take this a
gold color here from the burgundy
palette and I'm going to spritz my brush
with a little bit of a makeup setting
spray so what I'm using is just from
both FRA because I don't know what my
fix+ has gone up completely lost it and
then I'm just going to pack that all
over my lid I'm just blending that all
across my eyelid area now it's going to
take it this shade from my glitter
ingestions palette here I don't know
what it's called but I'll leave it down
below because it doesn't have the names
on the back so I'm kind of just putting
that on and then just blending it up I
guess I didn't use any glitter glue
because you don't really need to use
glue when it comes to these glitter
injections because of like they already
just stick to your eye sometimes I like
to use glue if it's one way or if I use
on clients but um today I'm just
choosing not to you know what song is
stuck in my head of being stuck in my
head all morning Stacy's mom has got it
goin on Stacy can't you see you don't
have a dick for me that'll actually I'm
using today are from
here to beauty and these are the Sascha
number 11 they're quiet and I haven't
won lashes like this in a while so I'm
kind of excited to see what its gonna
look like but firstly I'm just going to
play a little bit of my map extended
play mascara this is perfect for bottom
lashes but it's also really good for
tops I'm just sticking that on with the
house of lashes clear lash glue if I had
eyeliner on I would be using the black
one but because I don't today I'm just
gonna be using the clear one in case I
mess it up what is going on with my
camera like focus thank you
it's honestly a piece of sorry if I
keep looking back into the viewfinders
because my camera autofocus is playing
up so far I'm just gonna stick this
 as bitch - or one oh I like
that I'm supposed to be our eyelash on
and I will be right back
okay so now let's move on to the face
I'm going to be using the Mac strobe
print feeling a bit of a glow nothing
that's going to show because it I always
use for coverage foundation and I cake
it on but I just feel like using this
because I do know another topic that I
really wanted to touch on was just song
me um more so my lips I uploaded a video
my last video that you guys saw um a lot
of you were like wow the lips are so
excessive like they're getting too big
now um I didn't actually get any more in
my lips um I got some Botox and he had
to flip my top look a little bit more so
they do cut off bigger and yesterday's
video was the first time I'd use gloss
in quite a long time and lip gloss does
make lips look a lot bigger plug er and
juicier um I'm really happy with them I
love them I love my lip lady it's just
that some people don't agree which is
totally fine but maybe just keep your
opinions to yourself like I don't know
if the people that were saying that our
actual subscribers or just trolls coming
onto my video and trying to put me down
or whatever but I'm happy with
my lips okay so everyone needs to just
count EF down and for my foundation
today I'm gonna be using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills porcelain stick foundation
or porcelain porcelain
after applying that across my whole face
I'm just going to take my morphe g36
brush and just
all out until he is all blended while
this foundation is salty like chickens
the option of using the type shape tape
concealer and also me coming up my chin
my Cupid's bow my nose and my forehead
I'll blend this out and then I drew
underneath my eyes so I can bake that
straight away first now if you bake my
under eyes I'm just going to be taking
the our fryer translucent powder and I'm
just going to do a bit on my foot just
basically where I put that concealer I'm
just going to be studying everything now
is because I'm feeling like I'm a little
bit too light I'm just going to take my
Australis in darkest Brown and I'm just
going to hopefully make this face a
little bit darker
to contour today I'm just going to be
using the Todd Park earth princess
contour kit and I'm just going to take
that warm shade here I'm just going to
start bronzing and lightly contouring
and I'm just using my as though everyone
just and Lux cheek sheer brush
now I'm going to take a little bit of
that color just on this little brush
here and just slightly go down the side
of my nose just because it doesn't get
lost in concealer a lot of you guys have
been asking me if I hear a box
yes I do have a pure box it'll be down
in the description and I don't know why
but a lot of you don't know that I've
got it but I do so it's down in the
description and by no means am I saying
yes send me stuff know you guys know
send me a letter if you guys want to
send me anything
go for your life because I check it
every two weeks every week I guess for
my blush today I'm just gonna be taking
this in cosmetics blush in the shade
Genesis coin well I used to say that a
long time ago my channel ever made
everyone made fun of me so I still don't
know how to say it haven't improved but
it's really nice pinkies sort of color
I'm just going to put that on the apples
and kind of blend it there I've been
loving like a heavy sort of blush lately
I don't know why but I just do I feel
like it just brings it all together sort
of thing you know what I mean now for my
highlighter I'm just going to be using
jeffree star cosmetics skin type I have
not used this in a lot in
it so I'm gonna just chuck this on and
I'm gonna bring it around the tops of my
brows just slightly you know click that
close oh slow like YUM don't forget that
Cupid's bow and I'm just gonna grab my
finger do a little bit on the tip and
just kind of drag that up for pretty now
let's get these under eyes finished I'll
just leave me guys in and we'll finish
this off
now underneath my eyes I'm just going to
apply a little bit more Mac extended
play best foot bottom lashes now the
finish of this look is a lip time I'm
just going to be using the Marc Jacobs a
