look what you do is it too much Oh what
have you done with the concealer you
have you over
she hasn't used tequila before what are
you doing trying to wipe it off
yeah I'm just blending and blending it
blew it blending you in a while so I'm
trying to be correct works with water
using the infallible 24-hour map we got
you into that makeup Michael it's so
good isn't it
do you like it I do I love it yeah it's
good studying it's such a moment excuse
my brushes because I haven't cleaned
them um I'll be a bit lazy she goes
again
bet she goes okay oh you're Sparky
how'd you get it all in your hair I
don't know you're really going for a
brushing I can't see what I'm doing this
one sunny with glasses on I need to be
like this far away from the mirror
because I'm short-sighted and I didn't
wear my glasses all through high school
that explains all the dust in
the house this works I can't see it what
are you doing mom conceal Ania mm-hmm
can you explain to people to stop
yelling at me because I'm having a
this back in little stick there
will be fun just right but I have a girl
do you feel up can you explain to people
why you don't accept or you don't care
about me giving you any of the makeup
that I get sent in like PR and stuff
well Michael does give me a few bits and
pieces but I don't use a lot of makeup
so I don't need a lot of makeup she
doesn't care about high-end brand she's
always left her study concealer and
stuff and when I do give there something
like I forcefully give it to her and
everyone in my last video because you
have such like yet all that one your
makeups drugs so everyone was assuming
that I don't give you anything and stuff
like that every night like Michael does
give me quite a bit of makeup and I do
use it occasionally but uh I've always
been very frugal with my makeup because
I've never been really into it just very
basic makeup I've never really done all
the stuff like all the layers and all
colors no you know just a basic purse
basically careful eh yeah but no
Michael's giving me quite a few products
recently and I've got some fixed lore
silver but somewhat fixed plus over Omar
we gotta start watching too much Chris
you're turning into me Holmes so I just
like to think he's great I'm gonna do my
eyeshadow now I've got um this throw
kindness around life and 50 from tart
that Michael gave me Jeff honest
japanesse cuz this wasn't a random
eyeshadow palette yeah but me too
Michael gave me both of things and I
love this one this is my fave
I'm gonna be using the Mac full coverage
concealer I have never used before I'm
kind of nervous but at the same time I'm
like mmm-hmm we gonna do like this oh
she's thick hums she's ready to go it
looked terrible many imagine it in the
creases I'm starting off with the one
called party as my transition shade
good job ah that was a proud
moment methylene this foundation is so
this is the thickest foundation I've
ever used in my freakin all I strong
smell matte foundations and generally
Mac rocks do you have a very strong
source valve no hardly
yeah no I really like this foundation
Veronica think it is Jay how
hard is this to get out so yeah
mmm this is kind of hard to blend with a
beauty blender as well but it's
definitely full coverage mmm oh I mean
coming now oh hey Gabi now stupid-ass
bitch what's another one you doing in my
cruise oh if anyone wants to know where
I've got my headband from in case you
wanting one I like a pink pearl that's

makeup it's so pretty
I haven't actually is that a story I
notice for the other day the first
teaser huns Oh blast

name you look weird
okay another question what was the
weirdest thing that I did as a child and
what was your reaction I can't say you
did anything really weird you've always
been different
you've always been you were different
kinder you were like more mature than
the other kids
you still played up for you a more
mature well so you've done anything
really weird yeah you were different at
school and I didn't know why when did
you know that I was well I sorta do this
I suppose I always knew a little but you
don't sort of think about it
probably heist not to high school not
until after you
midway through high school probably yeah
yeah and then you actually told me after
you told me
how's everyone knew since I was like
basically out of the world well I'm
calling you on you and when other family
members were buying me Barbie dolls and
Christine motorbikes aren't interested

wouldn't care if I tell them that so one
more questions that I'm getting asked
