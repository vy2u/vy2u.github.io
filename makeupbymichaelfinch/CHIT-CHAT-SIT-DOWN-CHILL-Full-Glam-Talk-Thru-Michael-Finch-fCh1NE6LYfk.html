so today I want to do a full glam look I
want to just chill out and do my makeup
and come up with something full glam and
super cool so I'm basically just gonna
be doing my makeup and trying to you
guys so let's get into this video now
are you guys loving this hairstyle or
are you hating it I'm not too sure about
it but I really like it I really really
lasted she wanna have makeup on it
really like I love it I'm gonna assume
you guys in because I'm gonna do my eyes
first like always okay for my eye base
today I'm gonna be using the NARS
concealer in the shade creme Brule
I used to use this in the Shh until II
years ago and when I was in America I
just picked it up because I really liked
it and I just like changing up my
products you know so it's not touch that
take every single video oh there I'm
really excited to use this concealer
again because it is really really good
and it used to be such a huge thing like
everyone was using it but then it just
kind of went out of fashion when top
shape came into place you know today I'm
gonna be using this because you know
changing it up I'm just gonna set that
in place with some of the Laura Mercier
translucent powder now I was debating
about what helot to use today and I'm
gonna be using the Anastasia Beverly
Hills modern Renee signs because I
haven't used that in such a a long time
and I know a lot of you guys love this
palette so I'm gonna go for like a Lac
Marone sort of look I guess I don't know
I'm just gonna do something and see what
happens because that is my favorite
thing to do so I'm gonna go in with the
shade called tempura first so it's like
this cream shade up here and I'm just
gonna pop that I think I said that right
Tim tempura tempura I don't know
so hot in Brisbane today it's like 40
degrees and not even having three air
conditioners on in my house is helping
the situation it's a problem that kind
of a fox watch all yeah yeah this is
like not working like rock on and work
on now I'm gonna take a little bit of
the shade called burnt orange and I'm
gonna use this as my trends as he show
today just focusing it like in my crease
and then we're gonna blend this baby up
I'm gonna bring this all the way into my
inner corner just cuz we're gonna do
full glam so it's gonna be quite intense
today till you know now I'm gonna go in
with a shade called a love let it down
here which
really nice pinky shade and I'm gonna
pop that in my outer-v
I'm gonna start working fat all the way
and I'm just gonna keep blending this
upwards and I'm picking up a little bit
of burnt orange as I go - just to help
the blending process of the pinky color
okay I'm finally back okay so I'm gonna
keep blending this part and making it
super like smoky looking I want this
look to be kind of like full tonight I
mean I don't know what the fuck's going
with my air conditioner but it keeps
turning off maybe because I've had it on
for like the past four days rock on
soldier do you know and I really need to
do I need a go-to like Harvey normal or
something advice from fans because
they're all in stock now when I moved
here it was winter and they had no fans
okay now I'm gonna take the shade
Venetian red and red ochre and I'm gonna
mix the two together and I'm gonna go to
town and I don't walk off gonna be
blending that through my crease now I'm
going to take any black eyeshadow the
one I'm taking us from the Sephora Pro
palette because it's my fave
so just take any black eyeshadow and I'm
just gonna darken everything up just
because the modern renaissance palette
does not have a black eyeshadow
unfortunately if it did it would be
everything but it doesn't sorry we're
just gonna whack around it was placing
down on my outer V and kind of bringing
it across my lid slightly then take a
little bit more of Venetian red and just
run over the edge of that black and kind
of blend it out and then I'm gonna take
a bit more black and keep blending that
and I'm also just gonna take a little
bit of that black and blend it through
my crease all the way into my inner
corner and then I'm just gonna blend
that all now I'm gonna try something
different today I'm gonna be taking the
Inglot gel liner in the shade 94 now I
learned this little thing to do off
makeup by jar when she was doing my
makeup she did this and it just worked
so well so you know how you normally do
concealer and then you do like a little
cut crease you can just go straight in
with this and it's so much easier and it
looks so much better and more pigmented
so shout out to jar for introducing me
to that look I'll leave her channel link
it down below because you guys will be
blown away all her makeup so let's go in
and
we'll transfer with my hooded lids this
is dead-set like the easiest sort of cut
crease I think I've ever done when I get
to the edge I'm just gonna kind of blend
it and Pat it that looks so sick like
I'm so happy with that and that was the
most easiest application I've ever done
in my life dead set rock on now I'm just
taking a little bit more of a love
letter and I'm blending that on the out
of V and kind of just like bringing it
across the lid just to give us like that
gradient sort of effect yes now I'm
going to take a little bit of the Too
Faced glitter glue and I'm just gonna
pop that over where I put the planner
and I'm gonna be popping over a little
bit of the lit cosmetics Goleta in the
shade champagne wishes okay so I'm
really happy with how this is looking so
far I'm just gonna go ahead and do the
other eye and then we'll come back and
we'll keep going okay guys now that both
of my eyes are done I'm gonna be taking
the AMC gel liner by Inglot in the
number 77 and I'm gonna do a big
fuck-off wing because they're my fave
guys for the tip of my wing I'm gonna be
taking the benefit magic ink and so I
can do a really precise flick because
the AMC jaw line is a little bit dried
up okay so that wing I'm pretty happy
with that I'm just gonna do the other
one off camera because wings are so
freakin hard to do on camera okay guys
so for my lashes today I'm gonna be
using the sleigh everyday lashes in the
style Louise this is what they look like
I'm just gonna quickly pop these on and
then I'll get started on my face okay
guys now to get started on my face I'm
gonna be taking the Tom Ford complexion
enhancing a primer I'm just gonna pop
this all over my skin you know it's
gonna get this hair out of my face so
it's not all up in my grille because
it's the most annoying thing when you're
trying to your foundation and stuff and
your hairs that keeps getting in the way
like rock on that's not happening honey
for foundation I'm gonna be using the
power fabric along where high coverage
foundation by Giorgio Armani it was in
the shade 3.5 so I'm just gonna squirt
some of this onto the back of my hair
and then I'm just gonna go to town on my
skin

super excited I love seeing you guys

the time on Instagram and it just makes
me so happy
it's such a fun process like creating
the merch and then like seeing people
wear it like it's just sort of fun it's
gonna conceal the tops of my brows with
that foundation my brows are starting to
go back to Instagram brows and kind of
liking it hey hey what are you doing a
little mahan yeah now she can steal my
face I'm gonna be using the NARS
concealer again and I'm just gonna be
blending this out I've wanted to just
sit down and just do my makeup and like
just do like a full glam like a look for
so long and I'm finally getting to do it
just chilling out you know now I'm gonna
go ahead and blend this concealer now
guys to bake my under eyes and stuff
today I'm gonna be using the Maybelline
fit me a loose powder I freaking love
this stuff so much just makes your skin
look like SAR smooth
um no flashback like I love it so much
now to set the rest of my foundation I'm
just gonna take the Laura Mercier
translucent powder on a big fluffy brush
I'm just gonna run over my whole face
I'm just doing it in dabbing motions
just so I don't want to move just
because I don't want to move the
foundation underneath it now in my
waterline I'm gonna take the makeup geek
full spectrum eyeliner then I'm going to
take a little fluffy blender brush and
I'm just gonna take these shade cold
let's take a Venetian red just a little
bit and I'm just gonna blend this black
down but I'm gonna take a little bit of
the shade called burnt no raw sienna my
bad and I was gonna blend that pink down
even more
now it's gonna dust off all this powder
that I've had sitting there cuz that is
no longer needed now I'm gonna run over
my falsies just get a little bit of
powder did fall into them and for my
bottom mascara I'm using the Loreal
carbon black okay now to contour my
favorite thing ever I'm gonna be taking
the Tarte clay play palette I love this
so I go down much I'm gonna take the
middle shade called desert what does
that hot off and I'm just gonna start
chiseling out this head you know I
forget this jaw line what I do is I just
go like this hook it up and then just go
under and then I just blend it all the
way down my neck so there's no like
difference you know a little bit under
this bottom lip now for bronzer I'm just
gonna use the Rimmel maxie bronzer and
just put a really generous amount onto
my face I've been loving this super
intense contour lately I'm gonna clean
it up with some translucent powder but
just lately I've just been loving it cuz
it really like makes my face look
slimmer and I mean who doesn't want that
rock on I'm just gonna slightly contour
my nerves a little bit
now I'm just gonna clean up underneath
this contour to bake I'm just using the
laura mercier and then a few seconds
later I'll just dust that off and that's
clean that up quite nicely
there we go that's pulled my nerves in a
bit more now for my blush
today I'm gonna be trying out the Oprah
blush in the shade Bellini this is a
matte blush by the looks of it which is
good it's gonna go with this look I'm
just gonna blend that on the apples of
my cheeks and just kind of bring it back
a little bit I love it when blushes are
like pigmented but like they're not too
pigmented so you can build them up
because sometimes you just go straight
in with a blush and it just looks too
much fun
too much it's gonna work the foundation
off my lips because it's gonna crusty
yuck I hate that so much when that
happens now to highlight my face I'm
just gonna be taking the earth FRA
highlighter palette recchia and I'm

I'm just gonna pop some of my in a
corner now for my lip color today I'm

lipstick in the shade I can and now last
but not least I'm just gonna set my face
