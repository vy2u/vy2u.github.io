as much as you do you know just a little
bit not my fish bitch okay so we just
lost Twitter to ask us questions so in

flying around it stops yeah kiss your
eyes was gonna take off yeah I think
over supply of my face legs of their own
Slater okay so the next question is what
are your three biggest pet peeves
people who don't reply to text messages
like almost straightaway me we're gonna
give a it's not a party quickly you
do I don't give a if you're at work
I don't care if you're taking a I
don't care if you're at a wedding I
don't care if you're like whatever if
you've got a phone use it and reply like
I don't care if you're half asleep wake
up and reply and then go back to bed I'm
so chilled with people applying cuz like
I'm really bad apply myself to most
people so like I don't care if people
take forever to apply because I know the
feels I just got me bothered sometimes
hater like I just call me buggin you
even stand up no just hurry the up
my biggest pet peeve is when people
birth in my face I think it is
disgusting and I million vomit I don't
know what it is it's just like the
inside of your of your stomach coming up
and it stinks so bad like files aren't
that bad but first I disgusting cretin I
thought gee I dunno maybe you about

because you're always far well yeah but
is fine for mascara I'm taking my Mac
extended play gigablack lash it's gonna
hurt wait talking about eyelashes I'm
just taking my uh nastasi our Beverly
Hills contour kit and just contouring
another question would you rather have a
head the side of a tennis ball or a
watermelon my voice is going as ice
creamy a head to speak hello Michael
look expression yeah or one melon we
should be like probably sides to be head
now I feel like if I had the size of a
head of a tennis ball so I said that
wrong he caters I would look like Indy
nineties body is so big and it's just
like this little tiny head like chillin
at the top there is isn't there yeah
well I'll just stick to the watermelon
because obviously I'm not gonna change
it all time to lashes I'm taking the
Quran how do you say that

die

scar today I am going to be using the
Too Faced better than my scar ah this is
gonna be incredible this is amazing I

come on another question was yeah if you
could wear one makeup look at the rest
of life what would it be for bit glam
really I would be just like a really
nice soft
on the eyes like soft warm look and then
really bronzy with a nice pair of lashes
so it's like daytime and nighttime no
new blip my motto I'd be four be like to
the absolute okay I'm gonna
