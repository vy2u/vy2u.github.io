let's get into this benefit eyebrow
tutorial okay guys the getting started
on my brows I'm first ly going to take
the precisely my brow pencils in that
number three number three suits my skin
tone well my hair tone my brow and super
super well what I will do is in Vegas
spoolie and first and I'm just going to
brush through these hairs and get them
all in the right place on both eyebrows
of okay then what I like to do is I like
to take this end here and I like to
start literally drawing in underneath
and it just kind of creating like the
base sort of shape to the brow so I like
to always extend my brown and here
just because they outside short and then
what I'll do is I'll just grab that and
just flick it up through through my brow
and then up through the front just
lightly so I don't make any harsh lines
we're just down the edge there okay so
that part's pretty straightforward then
what I'll just do is I'll just brush
through them once again and brush their
has more so upwards because we're going
to that natural sort of rough day
because that's what I've been loving
memory I'll take is benefits gimme brow
in once again number three and this
basically just kiss all the blonde hairs
brown and just makes them look a lot
more defined without adding too much
definition and giving you that whole
like you know block brow sort of look so
I'm just going to brush through these
hairs gel and once again I'm brushing
them up as I go sort of thing
I feel like let me brush the hairs off a
kind of elevates your whole face and
kind of brings everything back which is
what I love because I love that look you
know obviously exactly the same of this
eyebrow and then brushing those hairs up
like beer see how natural that looks I
love that then I'm going to take a 3d
brow phones and this is in the shade
number four basically what this does is
it just enhances and highlights
different parts of your brow to give
them more like definition and more of
that 3d sort of effect I'm just going to
brush this slightly up through the brow
and towards the end same on this one you
know how close and that's pretty much it
for the brows anyway guys I really hope
