to intro the video okay here we go do
you want to do it while we're not
driving okay
you're making me a little bit nervous
nervous I'm a good driver okay I'm a
good driver
hello guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm here with Davina
introduce yourself sis hi my name is
davina Rankin you might know me as
Australia's biggest villain oh my god
you ran into the wall all right you know
you really do you're talking about daddy
oh now
I feel like I have a pretty good idea of
what's going to happen if you stop I
mean don't look at the rise I mean like
I'm looking at the rise like what are
you talking about okay I know how to
drive like die trying
oh I think we're having our first
domestic already is this a good one
I think so I asked you guys on my
Twitter any of you had any questions to
Dobb
I'm gonna call you dot Oh Oh does she
have a new boyfriend well all right my
boyfriend's I feel like after one failed
marriage I should probably just stay
single and reassess that and come back
to a light on how much of the show was
real and how much was scripted Oh like
reality TV isn't as like reality is what
you think because it there's a lot that
goes on that you don't see and I'm just
like I'm a super sarcastic person but
like you know sarcasm can come across as
bitchy and especially when things on the
right context it's hard for you to like
understand what we were talking about or
who we were talking about sometimes you
know conversations come from like the
day before so it's like it's really
weird
it's not necessarily scripted but
there's like a lot of that girls
goes down I'm gonna get screwed down
thanks for that guys
how did you meet Michael Wow Wow I
literally did a snapshot last night and
I was like who wants me to get Devon my
channel to do a couple karaoke stranger
yeah I got like 20,000 screenshot yeah
let's go ahead oh okay and then sorry
one of my friends said that he had
messaged me and then I looked in my
messages at our fan goed and flipped the
switch and then that was literally like
a few hours ago literally have lunch and
it was great we were everything
okay you need our large you know toehold
actually how old are you how do you
think I am 20 or 25 I've got that we
were driving I'm turning 27 on Monday oh

one let's find out we stir that or is it
too warm to drive like a mum joy what's
the most embarrassing thing that's ever
happened to you to me yeah actually
sorry yes I'm the most embarrassing
thing that's ever happened to me was it
was probably about
actually no prob about a year ago this
guy I like to be able went out clubbing
and I was just gonna I was staying a
 anyway I went to kick my leg off
and just be like Kate cuz I swing it man
alright I fell our vows I put my
leg up and I went off down and he helped
me up it was it was so embarrassing he's
like he's just using anyways I
had I really can't think of like it the
most appropriate one but like um how
about I thought I liked a guy
who was 40 and rapped on national
television and had a rap name
but I actually here we go hey
something's not it goes idly knowing
Dean like I'd only met him twice
like when that whole affair fake affair
thing happened ah yeah that's hectic

your favorite I mean like obviously I'm
gonna say you love you back he can be
with your second favorite

like watching on TV like I think it's
just so entertaining yeah 13 was a dame
Ryan
Tracy
not like a favorite but like like yeah
okay like entertainment was yeah very
like you and her very entertaining yeah
but obviously came down like what do you
mean oh that's probably fair sorry I
lied
what were you doing I feel like I would
probably be more suit it's like Big
Brother
plus I think like maybe just like get
married for me wasn't like best option
because I think I'm only 26
wait Lord especially when Jemaine I'm
sure he likes ya here has an arranged
fake marriage like that's just crazy
I did crazy so what's your
favorite drink what do you drink if you
were to go out seaman
like actually I love a bit of Gregor's

can literally get the bottle and stick
it up there anything on top of that
before they just spit on it

is with you driving on dry concrete
bitumen

her Oh would you learn probably not see
that my god I've had nightmares about
Chinese being in my face really okay I'm
gonna interrogate the out of you
you don't have to answer me if you don't
want to okay who do you hate the most
Hite the Mars whoa people are very like
look just cut to the chase here the
do you hate the most
Heights a strong word okay like look at
the whole Tracy thing was pretty shitty
mainly because Tracy and I were talking
the whole time on the phone in between
being on camera and then on camera it's
like she never said like she was sorry
like all that kind of stuff so it's like
she was like a water present away from
the cameras and then one thing I would
say one she liked surrounded the glass
pretended like we never spoke and that
kind of stuff so that a bit like the
whole thing was a shitty situation bow
what a bitch we understood each other
she we feel like that's being so
two-faced like on and off camera
and then it makes me look like an
insensitive bitch when I like well I've
actually been talking to her black this
whole week leading up to the reunion she
called me I was the first person that
she called after she dumped Dean and
I'll I've got the messages in my phone I
got the messages shall I show everyone
what are you gonna get sued for doing
that probably that fun yet
 orange light I just went through a
red light say this is what happens when
you get too involved in Gaza or you
start during exactly but look I
don't not like anyone but that was a
pretty shitty thing and then for her to
be like with Sean and then still texting
Dean photos of her no lingerie I know
people like you think they can get away
with anything and I'm like bitch I'm
 television like I didn't get
away with anything we didn't have an
affair I had a vein art that was so
awkward last night when when I'm Dane
brought up that she was sending photos
in her lingerie like I died that's very
funny so that was that's the shitty
thing but I don't not like anyone like
we all went through a really
weird experience are you kind of like
hug that all it hummin Shaw but that was
a shitty thing
her is the biggest crepe like he was one
he just looked at and just went birth my
husband it's like a brother in systole
think you know when you learn just get
so and greeted like your father
yeah it's like him and I would fight all
the time like all the time but we had
like a lot of fun but we fought all the
time so he would probably annoy me the
most because I spent the most time with
you okay yeah I'm answering these very
lag you know I don't want to get sued
yeah I'm a very punctual person you are
learning so much from this old
duck I learned a lot of things very
quickly yeah bye listen I listen to
every little thing I notice every little
thing do you ha I don't forget anything
what happens in these couples I'm sorry
over the couple's
she's probably sending your friends
photos colonel Android mate haha what
else what else can I ask you six foot
six inches these are whisper needs a
whisper something in your ear like I'm
not normally this person but I need to
whisper something in here yeah I'm not
I'm not saying in the video
no oh no I've seen the further oh good
good good yeah yeah like hectic
right yeah sorry hectic yeah but even
after its toll just it's a little bit of
opportunity right yeah to me energy like
Lily Brown yeah you lovely lady I really
don't like no I love her I think
she is the cutest thing ever
she was going on about how hot she is a
lunch oh yeah I think Lily's an absolute
little babe one of my plans now that
mass is over so I still will be running
my brunches so I have like an events
business a clothing label and a personal
training studio
yeah it's pink she wants to train me but
I'm like I honestly think that you
wouldn't have so much fun training I
have the biggest problem with people
telling me what to do but like I said
I'd say it nice I'd be like bitch can
you please drop and give me 20 21
whatever you want
I don't do push-ups I don't do sit-ups I
don't know what any of that is saying
why didn't you say you're sorry sorry
guys I said I was sorry
a million times obviously don't ever
want to hurt people's feelings I can
never want to try anyone's feelings on
the show but I'm you know obviously
you're there for love so I kind of was
like well if you have a spark with
someone and you were here for that
reason and it's also like a TV show so
you never know like in my head I was
like maybe we got matched with the black
wrong people but my person is actually
here which actually happened with Troy
and Carly and Sean and Tracy anyway so
it's kind of you can tell now that it's
kind of normal to me
to other people I don't know what that
sounds ah you dog how do you
like the drama so much I actually didn't
even realize there was so much drama
until you watch it back you're like oh
it's so funny like everyone else's

I hope out of the car and it's like Jen

the biggest in that show Oh totally they
need that they need it they need that to
keep the ratings off yeah and

like the music and like your headline
