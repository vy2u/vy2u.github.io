today you are all going to be getting
ready with what so the look that I want
to go for today is like deep dark like a
full coverage obviously I got some new
products that I want to try out and I
want to kind of do like an olive smoky
green smokey eye no I have got fake tan
on so I will be doing the whole matching
face to neck sort of thing so um yeah
okay fine you need to go on silent shut
the up I don't want any emails
coming through and I'm trying to feel
with you shut up
so I want today's tutorial to be
something different from what I normally
do don't know if that's gonna work
because you know we all like my full
coverage thick cakey party birthday cake
 but I have some new lashes that I
want to try out that I got sent and they
look amazing like they're so long and
like whoo okay I'm ready
so I've just doomed you guys in a little
bit so you can see a little bit easier
um we are going to be starting off with
the eyes today and I'm going to be using
the Mac Pro Longwear concealer and what
I'm doing is just painting that across
my my eyelid every year look how
seamless the beauty blender blends are
concealer on your ideas your the most
perfect base then just don't look hard
until you set it and then it works okay
now I don't really want to look up
because my eyes crease so easily but I'm
just going to be taking the Australis
fresh and flawless pressed powder in the
shade medium tan just to set my eyelids
we have a creased at all I think this
might be a bit dark but I'm alright now
you can breathe once your eyelids is set
because they're not going to
crease now for the base of my eyes or my
transition I was going to be using Peach
Smoothie by makeup geek and I'm just
going to run that through my entire
crease area not being too perfect with
it just kind of popping it in there just
so we have a little somethin'-somethin
you know blend out to that brow bone
area I swear I've been sick for
literally three weeks like every single
morning I wake up and this is like my
head is like all blocked and it's
disgusting and just like mucusy like Oh
gross like every time I blow my nose
it's like I'm gonna vomit
it's up the that comes out
of your body literally a lot of you have
been asking me to get a PA box and I
really want to get one if you think I
should get a Piero box leave a comment
down below and I will get a Piero box
now I'm taking Koko back from makeup
geek this has some black shadow and I'm
just going to try and avoid that on all
costs tap off your brush and then I'm
just going to go through into that
crease area I've got this patch on my
eye that never sticks to eyeshadow and
it's literally the most irritating thing
ever
blending out that transition Coco bear
the most helpful thing in the world is a
transition color because if you put down
your transition color and then you go
with a darker color and then you want to
blend that out better you go back in
with your transition color and blend it
out but looking pretty how I want it to
look actually it I'm just gonna
darken up the Coco bear a little bit
more because it's just not dark enough
for me it's just not it's not doing it
today bringing on an eye lift
come on alias I've been watching so much
Jeffrey Jeffrey style lately and I
spotted what he says in every single
video like ten times let's give it a
whirl and he's like yes come on Coco
bear you better work
it's very funny oh my god he was talking
to a stingray the other day on snapchat
what did he say I don't know buddy was
talking to a stinger I was like
yeah stingray or I was calling it like
Manny ray you better work it was sorry
 Jenner is like flopping around
in the ocean actually I'm just
gonna darken up this whole entire craze
cuz I just want it to be so intense now
like she's getting like more and more
intense as the more color I pack in and
I said I really don't know what's going
on with this I just want it to happen
well I'm just going to be taking a
little bit of makeup geek corrupt and
just doing a little bit of
something-something
so I kind of want to focus this on the
outer V and I want to bring it up all
through the crease area just below Koko
there I'm just gonna take Coco bear and
blend that out
sorry I don't talk much when I'm doing
my eyes because I'm really concentrating
when I do my face I talk a lot more now
this part scares me a little bit but I
am going to be taking the Maybelline
I'm going to be taking the Maybelline
studio gel liner and I'm going to be
doing a black base on my eyelid because
I really want the green to show up if
you use the black base to some colors
that shows up a lot better and I'm just
really scared to do this because I'm
scared it's not going to blend out and
it's just going to be like a big thick
 line
so everybody pray for me because I'm
ready to go oh I'm scared I'm
scared so I'm just bringing it across my
lid and kind of up into the crease oh
yes that's actually worked pretty
 well hmm I'm just gonna be
taking a little bit more corrupt and I'm
just going to be going around the edge
of that just to kind of lock it in place
praying to God that it does not go
anywhere I am loving so the next part
that I do is actually going to tell me
whether this olive green smokey eyes got
to work or not mm-hmm so first I'm going
to be taking in chanted forest from
makeup geek this is a matte shade and
I'm just going to plop this all over my
lid oh my god it works it worked I don't
know if you guys can see that it's green
now but I'll do a close up after I'm
just taking that green and just blending
it up a little bit just in Chicago back
now I'm going to be taking the shade
venom from makeup geek this is a shimmer
I don't think it's a jewelry pouring but
it's just a shimmery shade so pretty so
I'm just gonna be packing that onto the
brush that I just used for the other
green and a little bit of fix+ just on
the brush I'm just gonna pack that onto
my lid okay
now we're talkin okay tops of the eyes
are done now let's move on to the face
okay I do need to dust away a bit of the
fallout occurred not much fallout though
but a little bit did happen now for
primer today I'm gonna be going back to
my all-time favorite primer this is
Benefit professional and I'm almost out
of this I'm so devastated squeeze a
little bit on actually a lot so use a
lot of this there we go
and just using my fingers to rub this in
I can literally see the comments about
my fake turn I can see them
so that was pimped out right in the
middle of my forehead but it's kind of
gorge so I'm kind of just going to leave
it there for now
so for my foundation today I'm going to
be using the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation and this is a tan color this
is this is a ten
this is in the shade will I don't
even know anyway I'm just going to be
using it I'll leave it down below what
color is so basically I'm just going to
be hoping that this matches my tan
actually that is perfect Bondi stands
and Make Up For Ever HD and cue so I'm
basically just going to be taking this
onto my face with a foundation brush
first okay what the hell is this Oh
comes out cool I've been wanting to get
this foundation what I've been wanting
to get this foundation ever since um I
went to a master class that Beyonce's
makeup artist did with Khloe Kardashian
and they use this and ever since then
I'm going to actually remember now they
actually did the green smokey eye as
well
this is totes inspired from Chloe Kay
I'm just going to be taking my damp
Beauty Blender and just blending it up
just before it gets a chance to set as I
don't know how fast this foundation
dries because I haven't used it before
now I'm just taking a bit of that
foundation to use as a concealer across
the sue concealer on it get off
I love how just use my headers' like a
towel or whatever I'm just going to be
using that foundation to conceal the
tops of my brow my dad is a bit
whistling and he knows I'm trying to
film a video inconvenient much dad thank
you oh it's the Magpies outside my bad
hash tag will living in the countryside
well first impressions of this
foundation it's so high coverage it's
probably a little bit too I don't know
what the word is but I'm gonna make it
work okay now for concealer today to
highlight underneath my eyes and my
t-zone area I'm going to be using the
pro concealer from la girl in the shade
porcelain this highlight is going to be
so bright when you use a darker
foundation you always need to highlight
that little bit extra just to brighten
up the area's a little bit more I just
zoom you guys in a little bit cuz the
lady went a little bit weird so um yeah
I'm just blending to start with the
stamp UT blender that I used before
Beauty blenders are amazing but I
honestly need to get any one because
this one is like it's ripped to
shreds it looks like a dog's been
chewing on it B I blame you I have a
habit will put him way too much
concealer
well that Andhra highlighter is so
extreme that's totally okay now to bake
my undereyes today I'm going to be using
the Husky ma no color powder I'm just
going to be packing that onto my under
eye area just stop to about the outer
corner of my eye and then bringing it
down into like a triangle sort of shape
is it annoying when people look in the
viewfinder instead of here is over over
here I just know in the comments let us
know in the comments
now she set the rest of my face today
I'm using the Australis medium tan fret
shouldn't flop the contour fresh and
flawless pressed powder just on a
massive brush and just packing that ball
over now to bronze my face today i'm
going to be using the Ofra bronzer in
americano and I'm just taking a massive
a brush like this and just going
straight in for that jugular hum now to
actual contour I'm going to be using the
Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer and
the shade deep tan matte bronzer and I'm
just going to be going in and starting
to chisel out my face it's going to kind
of create a bit of a new chin here and
I'm going to be focusing a lot of the
contour on the sides of my face because
I want to kind of bring it all in like I
want to look semi slim on I mean slim I
have a pencil sharpener here or
not where the did it go huh Indy
did you do that what the am I
talking about alone with bindi now sort
of doing some intensely gel liner onto
my higher I just want to go into my
waterline with makeup geeks I line up in
the shade I always say right I'm not
even gonna bother it'll be in the
description below and I want to put that
just in my waterline I'm just gonna be
taking a chance as far as from makeup
geek again and just blending it that
black line at our just want a small flat
shader brush now I'm just taking a
little bit more of Coco bear and just
blending underneath that line now that
the eyes are all done I'm just going to
be brushing off that baked ah kind of
little bit of a black cars don't your
eye but I kind of like that sometimes it
does sometimes it doesn't I think it has
now before I move on to mascara and
everything I'm just going to finish off
all my powders for my blush today I'm
just gonna be using mellow cosmetics
blush in the shape bronze I'll this
black eyeshadow on there not making that
mistake again
it's pretty very subtle I've got no pink
tones to it now for my highlighter I'm
going to be using utters katoa
in the shade conceded mm-hmm this refers
to a few people that I know
actually before I going with highlight
on its going to take over as banana
powder and I'm just going to pack that
underneath my eyes because I love doing
this it just gets rid of that white cast
from the our CMA and it kind of just
brightens up this area and gives a bit
more coverage so back in with artists
Couture I can see that this is a diamond
glow powder they call it it's a
highlighter just going to take it on my
Sigma highlighting brush and am I'm just
writing that across my forehead and
above my eyebrows as well cuz why not
for my eyelashes today I'm going to be
using it matte extended play gigablack
lash on top and bottom lashes if you
need a good mascara that lengthens
without clumping them this is your
mascara now the lashes that I'm using
today are from sofia sofia sapporo i
think that's how it said oh my god these
lashes are incredible look how
long and minke they are they're so long
so that's how long that the lashes are
now for my lips say I just brought this
model rock a liquid lipstick I did like
a bottom eyelash water when I do
freelancing for my clients so I ended up
getting this as well and this is in the
shade Born This Way so it's like a nude
color of course you can never have too
many nude lipsticks cray so I'm just
going to be applying that onto my lips
don't know what the consistency is like
or like for drying whatever so far so
good this is so pretty
Thomas I like this liquid lipstick dry a
little bit and then I'm going to do a
little bit of liner just because I feel
like doing a bit of liner in the
meantime I'm just going to be setting up
my makeup with the Ofra makeup fixer
spray this bottle is huge it gets so
much product in here
it's going to be setting my entire face
mmm now to line my lips I'm just gonna
be using Kylie cosmetics check a lip
liner so this is pretty much the final
look I just contoured my nose and that
will be in a separate video so anyone
who's interested in that keep an eye out
for it I don't know if it'll be up
