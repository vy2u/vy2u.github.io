tanning oil last out of my hair's and
forgot to wash them I mean this is what
happens okay sorry today I'm gonna be
doing just to get ready with me chatty
video catching up quite a bit to talk
about so you guys can either put me on
mute you don't hear my annoying
voice and put some music on and watch me
do my makeup or if you want to you can
listen to my voice so I'm just going to
spritz my face with a little bit of fix+
first just to get the juices flowing you
know oh my god it's got that off through
my lashes up happens hey oh my god
guys I finally got a hero box by the way
I'm just using the Maybelline fit me
concealer but yes I finally got a
 Pierre box just remember if you
do send me a letter which I don't expect
you to ah make sure you leave me your
return address so I can you know doc you
wanna know where you live
I've got some new Beauty blenders the
other day they just seem to be doing the
right job for me now it's gonna go
straight in and set that before I get a
chance to crease at all oh my god guys
so the other day I went and saw bad mums
at the cinema I think it's just stopped
showing in the cinema well the one where
I live had stopped showing as of today
because all the new movies come out on
Thursday and tonight me my friend are
gonna go and see I think I'm gonna go
see Blair which which I'm so excited to
see because last night I watched at all
but I actually shut my pants
so I kinda came to sing the new one as
well alright today I'm going to be using
that many mu a makeup geek palette I
have not dipped into this baby for a hot
minute so let's get into it I don't
really know what look I'm gonna be going
forward this I'm just gonna hope for the
best and see what happens
something a little bit of sticky tape
trick you know little bits in it sooner
zoom you guys a little bit just I can
say hello mom so I'm just going to be
dipping into this color here and a
little bit of this color here two users
like a transition so yeah what's
everyone been up to oh my god I feel
like I haven't sat down and filmed a
shadow video in quite a while so striped
cells in so as I was saying I went to
this cinemas the other night and I have
something to ask you guys I was driving
there and we saw a hitchhiker on the
side of the road now I don't know
whether to feel guilty or not that I did
not pick them up they kind of looked
like probably like a 22 year old like
they kind of turned to the side it was a
guy it was about 9:30 at night or a bit
earlier than that whatever and like me
being Who I am I just didn't want to
like risk anything but mmm I just hope
he and safely found a way home
because I had no intentions of helping
him I mean I thought about it but then I
was like I mean Wolf Creek is set here
in Australia so I don't and that's
apparently it's a base of a true story I
think so I don't want anything like that
happening to me imagine that for a
 storage on floor don't so we go
in with these two colors here kind of
smudge it through my closed area yeah
sorry I don't know what would you guys
do if you lived in Australia would you
pick up a hitchhiker
or would you completely just like avoid
out on all costs and just being polite
no way and how
picking up a hitchhiker but during the
day it's a little bit different when
there's people around but I thought it
was illegal to hitchhike here and
started a hardener it could be wrong but
um you know it got down
so now I'm just going to take this green
shave and just pop her throw my legs a
little bit of fix+ on that brush there
hon
oh well that love this green color so
much spoiler iridescent tea and like
pretty I ever liked it okay game
actually you don't I'm going to use my
wing say I'm gonna be using better than
magic King because I have not used this
in a hot minute either I'll be back in
two seconds in my wings it's really hard
to talk with your wings on camera so
hold up they don't love you like I love
you Oh morning boys that's out of course
oh those rings are dumb but what's gonna
completely ignore the fact that they are
both extremely uneven but that won't
matter once my lashes on for my mascara
today I was gonna be using my true face
better than dick it is the best let's go
I've ever come across
Emma for my lashes today these are from
a brand called
is a sin lashes even style Shea aiya
that's how you say okay that's what they
look like on the implying checking out
the work of these hands that I like the
channel I've rubbed it all over my body
like it looks fine here and here but
like when it comes to this it's like you
need to calm the down like it's bad
so I'm just blowing on these lashes like
a blow and you mean Dirk oh I don't know
what lip color to do Stan feeling like a
try to undo it but I was doing it I
don't know oh sorry now that we are done
with my eyes for the top parts of them
completely we still do the unthinkable
do that afterwards I'm going to be
moving on to my mine and this is that
that galpão from benefit I don't really
know what this is for like what this
meant to do also know that it's like a
primer sort of thing so I'm swimming
give her a shot Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam like
dear we all do like the earth is it just
me I have not turned my face completely
pink I don't there are I'm good warning
to this little up we decided to
arise from the dead so for my foundation
I've got an updated shade the only one
that I used to have this was the pale
shade but I went and got this shade so
when I fed ten
matches so this is the Loreal infallible
24 hour Matt Matt favorite drugstore
foundation as to this day I'm not gonna
be dotting this all over my face before
I go in with a damp Beauty Blender you
know now I'm just going to take my damp
Beauty Blender and start blending this
all into my skin why won't this
pimped-out go away by the way another
thing that I should touch based on is it
was actually my birthday at two weeks
ago I think and I don't like make a
massive deal out of my birthday I just
like I don't really like telling people
like at on Facebook yeah Wow
but like I just don't like making a
massive deal out of it so I don't I
don't know I just don't think it's a big
deal in my opinion some people think
it's a big deal but I don't think it is
I just want to thank you guys for the
post on social media on my Instagram and
like Twitter everything I saw all of
your messages and it meant the world to
me because thank you guys a lot of you

thank you no now I'm just blending it
out with my damp Beauty Blender you know
so this is the best way to blend
concealer out but yet for my birthday um
I got a MacBook Pro err I don't really
know what it is as light as a feather
I think it's an air I'm not sure just so
like I can edit on the go and when I go
like different places I can still edit
and just like because I had an iMac
before I still got it but like I
probably won't use it as much but it's
good to have there now to bake I'm

shitty dick so happy Monday guys I hope
everyone's having a fabulous Monday so
far in a great week you know I used to
hate mondays when I was in high school
because yeah I said high school not
primary school I never ever and I think
this is a good thing like don't do it
because it's not good but I never used
to go to school on Monday or probably
Tuesday or Wednesday I would hate school
story much like school just wasn't for
me and I just hated it I hated
it I feel like there's no point in me
even going because I've failed so many
units like there just wasn't a point
um Gibran's I'm just using Oprah's
Americano bronzer and like because if
you fail some of the units in school
like if you fail not sorry if you don't
tell the units yeah if you fell one part
of the unit or something you fail the
whole year so there's no point and I'd
already like failed like four of them
like religious education surprise
surprise mass surprise surprise um it
was like science or something else I
don't know and I obviously never did
sport in school I would always say that
I had an ingrown toenail
I forgot my sports uniform or I was sick
