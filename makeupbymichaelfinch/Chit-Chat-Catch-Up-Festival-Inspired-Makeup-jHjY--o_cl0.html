so glad to be filming again I haven't
actually sat down filmed a video in
probably two and a half three weeks all
the videos that you've been seeing have
been pre filmed because the summers you
may summers some as you may know I've
been in Brisbane I've been at Melbourne
there's been a few different parties and
events that I've gone to so today I just
wanted to kind of sit down
I weren't you kind of like a festival
sort of like chitchat
video do you not I mean so I've got some
new products that I want to try and play
with some products that I've tried
before but basically I just want to like
sit here and chat to you guys because I
feel like it is much much needed without
any further ado let's get straight into
this video and I really hope you guys
enjoyed I've missed talking to you so
much and I'm so glad to be doing a chit
chat again alright so I've sat down and
I forgot to wet my Beauty Blender and
get my Tarte shaped cake awesome
two of the most important things thank
you BRB alright so I'm just going to
start off by prepping my lids for
eyeshadow I'm just you're going to be
using the top shape tape of I don't want
to put too much concealer on today
because I kind of want to do a liquid
eyeshadow so I'm just putting a general
actually you know what I always say a
little bit but it always ends up being
sorry much so I'm just going to pack on
that concealer and I actually got a new
Beauty Blender filing like a official
I've actually got this massive like not
massive but I've got like a lot of
sponges and here there's like real
techniques and just like different
things that I've either picked up or
being sent so I've got a lot of sponges
and I've also got another one from Real
Techniques which is like their new
diamonds one that I want to test out
when I do like a drugstore video so I'm
so excited today
I feel like Beauty blenders are just
like they're all kind of the same like
Dee's are like a little bit different
cause either like the original Beauty
Blender like the other ones like Real
Techniques and stuff they're a little
bit harder but I feel like that will
kind of do the same job in the end like
you don't have to spend $30 on a sponge
like I did I don't even know why I got
this I just really wanted the nude one I
think it's so pretty so I'm just putting
that all across my lids and
to take a little bit of translucent
powder you guys know how we do these you
know chitchat if we don't really talk
much when we do the eyes because I'm
like concentrating but then when we get
into the face that's when I start
talking and talking abunch of that
no one actually wants to hear just
setting that so it's nice and crisp you
know now to do my eye shadow I'm just
actually going to do a whole sticky tape
method you guys know I love using the
sticky tape method so basically I put
sticky tape from the outer V and
straight up like that there we go so for
my eye shadow today I'm going to be
taking this morphe eyeshadow palette
this is the 12p palette it is super
duper colorful now some of you guys may
know I've never been a huge fan of
morphe ice shadows I think they're
really good for the price but I'm not
like the biggest fan of them I'm like
obsessed with eyeshadow formulas the way
they pack on the way they blend with the
other colors in the palette but I did
get sent a bunch of stuff from morphe
the other day so I really do want to you
know see if I can give this another go
and like see how it works out okay so
I'm kind of start off with this
turquoise see sort of color right here -
taking a generous amount I love this
color so much like tiffany blue almost
I'm going to focus that on my outer like
a V sort of thing basically through my
crease you know what I mean so as you
guys know if you follow me on snapchat
as I said earlier I went to Brisbane for
a few weeks and like partied and just
like hang out and just had fun I'm also
moving to Brisbane soon so I had a look
at one apartment and I mean I'm just
like so easily like the apartment that I
looked at I love it but I ran into one
so I kind of want to explore my options
a little bit more I really just want to
live in an apartment that's like high up
and just like really modern and like
really pretty because I've always lived
in like my house is like if you don't
know I still with my parents because I
am only 20 but um yeah I'm just I came
to Marie's out I feel like it's just the
right thing to do and who knows I might
not stay in Brisbane my whole life I
might just like move around the place
like because I feel like moving such fun
this is blending really well by the way
guys come on more feet bring us through
I'm just like picking out more color and
packing
on super generously but yeah we have
some parties to go to had so much to
drink anytime stunning its armed today
is Sunday so tomorrow I'm doing a detox
but just like this team that I got sent
because like honestly I need it so badly
like my kidney is probably trying to
kill me right now so I'm in desperate
need of a detox okay now I'm just going
to dip into this nice beautiful blue
color here and I'm going to start
defining my curly a little bit more you
know so I'm just going to thank and get
the rations I can with that and put it
right in my crease I think that was the
coffee that I had before oh it's
literally the same color as the one I
just put down almost that was like a bit
of a transition now we're getting into
the dark I thought I'd change it up a
little bit into something different cuz
a lot of people do call my videos saying
you always get the same thing as I love
my bronzy eyes I love my gold glitter
with my winged liner and my warm tone
Browns but I do agree I do need to
change it up a little bit so I've got a
lot of new videos planned a lot of
full-faced challenges and like full face
of this makeup full face of that brand
like I've got a lot coming up for all my
American because I do have a very large
American audience bigger than Australia
actually and I do like to please like
both sort of countries do not I mean so
and then like my UK people on do like a
full face using sleek makeup or just
like a UK makeup I wanna do like
American makeup like la girl Milani
stuff it's easy to get to them and then
I want to do Australian for like
bouquets of Australis like bu is another
Kmart makeup one and I also want to do
another full face using products I hate
with new products that I've found that I
do not like that are kind of new in like
2017 I guess anyway I'm gonna stop
rambling and keep going with this
tutorial so I'm just going to put a blue
straight in there so now that I think up
this a purple shade here and I'm just
going to focus that on my outer V and
just bring it up through my crease and
then I'm going to blend it out with that
previous color blue that I use and it's
going to kind of check in it's going to
kind of check in it's kind of kind of
Channing's like a dark sort of blue
color just dipping back into that blue
and kind of blending that purple out now
this purple is going to kind of taking
why do I keep saying tech instead of
turn what is wrong with me it's going to
kind of turn into like a dark so
blue oh I'm sensing like very aquatic
vibes from this do you know what I mean
very aquatic now the next thing I want
to take is this Inglot acrostic acrostic
it's a cream eyeshadow sort of like a
liquid eyeshadow that dries matte and I
really put this all across my lid and
like make it look sustained okay wish me
luck I'm going to look up because I know
it's going to transfer anyway and kind
of just pops up in the other guys I
really don't know what I'm doing so just
pray for me I'm going to need it and
then I'm just going to kind of blend the
edges slightly if they blend now once
we've got that color down and then going
to go in with this morphe pressed
pigment eyeshadow i swatch some of these
before and I was dying this is in the
shade powder room that's me classy so
I'm going to take that same brush and
I'm just going to pack that all over the
eye shadow the liquid eyeshadow that I
put underneath this is going to help you
know shot this pigment oh pretty okay so
after I've finished a laying and down
that more food pigment over the top of
that shadow I'm going to take this brush
and get into that purple again and I
want to kind of put purple on the outer
V and kind of just blend it into the
outer corner of the shadow if you like
I'm just going to put a little bit of
purple actually on the inner corner this
works just cure so it's kind of like a
halo sort of effect you know now this is
the feeling that I find the most
satisfying taking off the tape oh I'm
just going to clean up under my eyes
with just makeup wipe so this is what
the eyes look like kind of like halo e I
wish the perb would blend a little bit
more but it just doesn't want to blend
so this is what we're stuck with but
that's okay because I like it okay guys
so let's get started on the face I'm
going to take the Mac press M prime
natural radiant face this is like a
yellow undertone I don't really know
what it is or like what was meant to do
I think it's got yellow undertones in it
for what I don't really know what
reasons with no professional Hanham self
taught so I'm just going to pop that all
over my stray and in my mouth as well by
the looks of it thank you
okay let's chat so anyway I went to vamp
which is like a fashion show in
Melbourne Aversa like two weeks and you
know walk some of the fashion shows I
went there with Priceline and it was so
fun and some new friends and everyone
was so lovely I got to meet so many of
you guys like after the shows is
finished like it was so cool like you
guys are so nice like everyone everyone
that I met was so just like beautiful
and make appreciated um yeah it's so
good one stop primers oh my god my lips
move
oh my god anyway okay just a little bit
of six-plus on your push you know you
know the drill guys oh look I just love
six-plus honestly just me hard
thank you
for foundation today I'm going to be
using the hourglass vanish foundation
sticks I've got this in the shade shell
and Blanc now I'm pretty sure she'll
it's going to be a little bit too yellow
for my skin tone right now so I'm going
to mix in a little bit of balanc
I'm pretty sure that's how you say it
with that so it like matches my skin
tone you know what I mean so this is
shell I'm just going to put this all
over my head oh my god another thing I
wanted to say was you guys going to
laugh so hard at this so I was at Vance
and I was waiting to just like go in and
like meet up with the girl Sophie from
Priceline that I was you know there with
or whatever and anyway I was waiting
outside and Benji Owen and her boyfriend
walked past me and I looked at her and
the first thought that came in she like
looked at me and the first I kind of
like looked away because it was kind of
awkward but the first thought that came
into my head was should I ask for a
photo I'll be like are through video and
say get us a bindi coming out because
how iconic would that have been
anyway I didn't I didn't have the guts
to do I didn't want to piss her off well
like a new or anything oh my god so
quiet but yeah how funny would that be I
was so tempted to just like scream out
bindi coming
but I didn't anyways for those who are
asking bindi is doing extremely well I
spent the past few weeks of her it was
awesome I've missed her so much she's
such a little sometimes
you're not I mean I'm just going to
spritz my brush beauty blend up with
some six-plus like always and go to town
well this is probably true seek to be
using a beauty blender with so I'm just
going to kind of like press and drag at
first and then I'm going to go in and
dab afterwards you not I mean this
foundation is so beautiful and I think
this is a perfect match for me I have
not used this in such a long time I'm
just going to go ahead and add a bit
more I need some more coverage and I'm
just going to drag that down my neck so
it all matches up that matches my skin
tone perfectly joking me being gay then
I'm just going to blend everything on my
forehead and this shell and Blanc
together are just like the perfect match
for my skin tone so you know when you
get foundations on line and it's kind of
hard to tell because I live in the
country and the closest place itself a
love life is Melbourne which is like
three and a half four hours away driving
so that is taking my touch shape tape
I'm just going to conceal my face there
perfect and I'm just going to blend that
straight out with my Beauty Blender I
really like this move on some people
think it looks dirty but I love it
absolutely stunning now I'm just going
to do it underneath my eyes America is
going to take my inner clothes off
because I feel like it's making a lot of
noise for the microphone and we don't
want that do we
I'm just going to blend out all this
concealer
now this is set underneath my eyes I'm
just going to take my earth bra
translucent powder here and just pack
that on under there
over there under there yeah but me
oh love this translucent powder sorry
would so like smooth I'm like slow
finely milled honestly I'm obsessed with
overrides you have a discount courage
Barlow's how do I really like using
discount codes but there is plenty of
people with discount codes but over out
there like nikkietutorials for example
thinking of nikita toriel's she is
collabing with over i don't know if you
guys know you probably would have seen
if you watch her with like a highlighter
and three liquid lipsticks yes slowly
 nice that highlighter is I'm so
excited that I highlighter I'm going to
 my whole face off when I get my
hands on that so as you guys can see
right here I'm just taking that blue and
just popping it underneath my eye and
then I'm going in with that other blue
that I use and just kind of blending
that out on this little flat top brush
and just keep on blending out to make
sure it's cracking mulcair and then
there's taking the purple popping that
under there true and then blending that
all add with a little fluffy brush and
then I'm just knocking off all of my
baked and then setting the rest of my
face with that foundation powder now
that my eyeshadow was all done I'm just
going to take the Marc Jacobs velvet in
your Noah mascara and pop that on then
to my lashes I'm going to be using Lily
lashes in the style opulence they're so
pretty and in the meantime I'm just
going to stick on some of the Joey
essentially enhance are just so my lips
are nice and prepped for my liquid
lipstick because they're quite dry and
geeky at the moment so I'm just going to
pop these lashes on and I'll be right
back because I know this video is going
to be so I'm already so right that okay
so I'll just stuck my lashes on put some
mascara over them and also done my
bottom lashes as well now just to bronze
and kind of contour what I'm going to be
using and this is like literally in my
favorite bronzer ever this is the Park
Avenue print
park a princess bronzer from tarte it's
just the most perfect formula blendable
it doesn't go muddy on me it's perfect
for my skin tone I've got so much acne
here I broke out so much here the other
day I don't know why I'm still trying to
work out what product does it to me so I
don't use it again okay now does too so
the contour my face a bit more I just
contoured my nose a little bit as well
as you have a full in-depth tutorial on
how I do that so I will leave that
linked at the first thing in the
description I'm just going to contour a
little bit more with the hoola from
benefit they actually just came out with
a light version of this which would be
perfect for my skin tone so I need to
get my hands on it ASAP so I'm just
going to contour a little bit more this
foundation that hourglass one is kind of
gone like really patchy and weird around
my mouth area I don't know if it's
because I kind of got like a little bit
of a sweaty up a little bit happening
because it's hot under these
lights and it's hot in Australia
and I'm like sweating it all off I don't
know
doesn't look crash hot down here hun
mm-hmm this is Bobby Brown's blush in
the shade Clementine and it's like a
nice sort of pinky color I haven't
actually used one of these blushes
before so I don't know how pigments to
date are but where I get to find out
well that's nice I literally just put my
brush in there twice and it gives a nice
flush of color kind of matches the more
blush the more it matches my eyeshadow
I've been loving blush lately I don't
know why I just I don't know I love it
now I'm just going to spritz my face
with a little bit of the Mac and 6-plus
just a little bit that's the biggest
live at the tail time and then for my
highlighter today I'm going to be using
the heart exposed highlight oh this is
absolutely stunning now morphe sent me
some new brushes the other day so I've
got this new highlighter brush I think

bit and I think I like it I'm going to
