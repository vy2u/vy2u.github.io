channel
so here I am filming in my new house
finally this is the first video that I'm
filming in my new apartment and I am
literally obsessed it actually feels
sort of weird and different not you know
having done my mom and my dad and my
sister shut the fuck up so I can film
and not have the voices in the
background it's weird that it's just
silent I've been putting it off for two
days because it does feel like it's like
it feels really good but it's essential
it feels really weird so I've been
putting it off but uhm yeah Here I am
today I'm going to be doing a chitchat
or swimming in my that's not problem
today I'm going to be filming a check
get ready with me I've got a lot of new
products but I do want to try out a
boast about the a Jaclyn hill palette
and I have tested this twice already so
I can give you guys my honest opinion on
it and I really do like it honestly I
really do like it it's such a pretty
palette with gorgeous colors I'm
literally upset without any further ado
let's get straight into this a chitchat
and get ready
okay guys so today I'm gonna start off
with my eyes otherwise she won't look
like Miss Piggy you litt yes so how have
you all been going it's been a long time
since I've sat down and so I'm literally
cure to three weeks I think all the
videos you guys have been seeing on my
blog all the videos before that were
obviously pre-filmed because I was going
to the moving process I think I'm
starting to get back into like the whole
Instagram a brand you know and I think I
don't think it's gonna last longer
because I'm like low-key over so I'm
just going to be priming my lids with
top checked it it looks like this gives
the best eyeshadow base for your shadows
tonight that aircon up there is
literally fucked I don't know why making
so many weird fucking sounds it
literally felt like a water fountain I
actually bought a box out in the outside
my balcony and super cute get to
remember to wet that Beauty Blender this
guy right here moving has been weird
it's been giving me a lot of anxiety I
don't know if you guys watched my blog
that I just uploaded before this video
but I did a moving vlog if you haven't
checked it out go check it out because
it's extremely blow delicious and raw
and yeah it's very uncut you nanami so
these will live so much ship don't
crease the only creepily one happen in
BH is a cut crease alert which icon
religiously whatever okay now that you
guys are nice and close um let's get
started on my eyes I really want to play
with the oranges I'm just going to play
with the oranges in the buggy because
they look so nice I'm going to take this
shade right here it's going to start by
sucking this through like really not a
problem
I was just been going on in my life I
got three boys in the other day that was
so much fun so much fun
a fucking Twiggy sticks and I didn't
know that I made of like lips and like
tongues and like excess parts of like
animals and stuff like cows and shit oh
I haven't had like a Peter a large
amount of fatty food and like quite a
while besides Macker when I'm
hungover but that's okay and I just went
straight to me and literally I was
vomiting and shitting everywhere and it
was not fun
he never had food poisoning before you
know what it's like I'm glad I working
gas drives beyond and that's why my
voice is a little bit weird because I
was vomiting so much my throat and like
walk across my chest is really sore at
the mermen what whatever so my thoughts
on is palette so far like as I said
before I have used it twice before I
really do like it it's so different to
the actual that like the regular morphe
shadows I feel like everything in here
is such a different formula I don't know
why but I feel like it just is it's very
different
so this weird how my face is just like
right there but it looks so different
hello bindi now I'm going to dip into
this burgundy shake here tomorrow like
all over all bruised I was called up its
daunting and I can from Australia does
its massive rock called
all over how I even know that focus and
I'm just going to start popping this in
my own ability and they start admitted
like I literally just touched that the
tiniest bit I like to just blend so I
like you guys know how fast I am with my
eyeshadows like I'm sorry faster with
our shadows and the fact that this is
just so pigmented and it blends so well
so fucking well wall says guys I think I
know what we're going to do really do
like a halo sort of effects today you
know so I'm just going to take a more
denser brush and pack more of my colour
on just into like that out of V and the
inner corner now I'm going to take some
of the shade here and some of the shade
up here so this orange and is burgundy
look those two babies together and it is
just going to like darken it up you know
make sure all blended up now I'm just
going to take some of the black shades
down here and I'm going to focus this on
an outer V and in a corner once again
like you normally do with a halo
I mean okay after that blacks on that
I'm just going to blend out making sure
it's sorry Belinda can also make a
little bit more that first shades that I
used and just go over the edges to bring
it all together you know tomatoes lead
color today I'm going to be taking this
rose golde sort of shade up the top here
but when you do it's Isaac's place it's
like oh my gosh sorry pigmented then I'm
just going to do is to take my blending
brush with the leftover shadow from
before and just kind of blend over the
edges so I'm really impressed with the
eyelid color I think it's cute I mean
like what do you mean now I'm just going
to take a little bit of the black
shudder from the morphe palette and put
that right up against my lashline
let's do my face-i page upon today I'm
going to be taking the King Tyler Bradt
ones alot drama
I have no easier since it came out I
don't know why because it's beautiful
and I love supporting Kim because she's
so cute and sweet so just like to apply
clearly a lot to my face now I kind of
like try for this top this is from Todd
this is the pro Gloor highlighter it's
like a liquid highlighter just look down
on my cheeks joking this will show
through my foundation probably not
because I take it on its gonna use it
like a struggling sort of thing I don't
know if this is the right thing to do
but I'm going to do it anyway hashtag
break the rules it kind of just looks
like a liquid like striving illuminator
sort of thing
this shines through I'm so happy so
anyway as I was saying earlier I moved
in to my house by the way foundation I'm
going to use the regular pro coverage
foundation and I was on you know
Facebook last night and Twitter and I
was getting sent things that there are
threads on Facebook that there are
people trying to figure out where I
fucking live what do you mean yes I
deserved my privacy just as much as
anybody else in this world does and I'm
sorry but if you ever found out where I
lived like anyone has a sign out
live-in come to my house and like waited
for me or something don't expect me to
be knocked about it because that's sort
of disrespectful in my opinion you know
I've seen I've read stories I've heard
stories about youtubers being out their
own backyard in their own home and
people jumping over the fence asking for
photos with them and I just think that
is way too far like they have the right
to be angry
so yeah I think that's a little bit
cooked by the way guys I'm going to be
talking about it a little bit sooner but
I'm doing a Melbourne meetup on August
the 5th that's what I'm going to show
you guys right now I'm going to be
making a video soon it'll be entitled
I'm doing a MOBA meet up so you guys
will know that I'm doing a mobile Meetup
and that that video help you know let
you know on all social but it can work I
meet me in Melbourne it'll be on all the
stuff it at this year so make sure you
mark it out in your Diaries if you don't
want to miss out on making this bitch
the Foundation's so good I don't know
why I haven't used it in so long the
kind of dude glory through my skin that
highlighter I can't really tell to be
honest
time for my absolute favorite part
concealer so I have been loving me
Brisbane lifestyle I have also been
loving my cheeks you can really see my
cheeks Olivia I love that I've been
going out a lot lately and like drinking
and stuff and you know it's probably not
the best thing to be doing but you know
I'm celebrating I'm celebrating reading
here sis and I've been meeting
many of you guys literally ever are
going I think it's so cool especially
hop clubbing I love many gods and I fit
out clubbing I just want to touch on
something sometimes I do get really
really drunk I learned in box up a girl
a wild guard when I was out clubbing and
I was so drunk but I was like
unresponsive and yes sir I didn't
apparently she asked for a photo and I
just said nothing I'm not in a rude way
but I was just like I just obviously
could be fuck talking to anyone because
that's what I do when I drink vodka so
I've changed to tequila so I do talk but
if you guys have met me out clubbing
before you know that I take photos of
you I literally had a bunch of you one
time I'll never forget this time I had a
bunch of you next to me and if you're
near the bar if you're a subscriber and
you're neither bar while I'm near the
bar and I'm buying drinks I'll get you
all a round of drinks I buy so many of
you guys the drinks that I meet in
Brisbane so if you're ever near me at a
bar and you need a drink you don't even
need to hint it because I will actually
ask you if you want to drink because my
bank account the next days absolutely
sucks because I always you know just
blurt on you guys always really shook
when I buy you drinks so you're like
shocked by it but like you guys give me
this platform to work on folks or I owe
you guys the world and not to mention we
are so close to 500,000 subscribers even
saying that so fucking weird like what
what do you mean what you mean what are
you talking about I think it's crazy
that I think it's amazing I think it's
so cool that me can say that he works on
YouTube like YouTube is my job now if
you guys didn't know that I get to put
all my time and effort into YouTube I
don't have time to do another job I'm
currently not taking clients in Brisbane
at the moment either I know a lot of you
guys have been asking me I just need to
put all my time and effort into YouTube
especially because I haven't filmed in
so long of what a lot of touching up to
do is you know what I mean and if you
guys have any video requests that you
want to see make sure you leave them
down below because I need some newbies
you know you know things that are
trending give me some things that are
trending that you want to see if I just
go out and buy something to try it out
or if you want I go I don't know now I'm
sort of rather my takes a little bit
using the Too Faced chocolate Soleil and
median the best thing so far I know I
keep talking about moving but like it's
a big thing you know what I mean is I'm
so touched or like majority my friends
and I'm so close to being D I can
actually just walk across the road and
be like hey VIN like what do you mean
what are you doing what's up while your
legs open close them now like being too
scared ready for me every time you get
my favorite bronzer out because this is
not just doing me justice it's going to

invented I just ordered the Marc Jacobs

better everything going to slightly
clean up my contour nice little almost
straight away now for a little bit of
blush I'm going to use the Papa Joe
peach blush by Too Faced and it's all
the pages and I love peaches I love
peach tea there's any peach thing I love
I won't actually eat a peach fruit
because I don't like the texture and I
don't like the skin itself airy and dark
it's fucking taste like peaches you know
how if you get the Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronze when you mount a like
chocolate just taste like peaches as
well as smell like it okay I'm going to
finish off my eyes I'm just going to
take the last number lashes mascara from
