new video so today I'm just going to be
doing a chit chat catch up get ready
with me I've got some new products that
I want to try out so I'm going to be
doing just that
also today I'm going to be covering a
few things that I've been wanting to
talk about for quite some time now
including my Instagram I know I just
want to like talk about all my youtubers
I haven't ever really spoken about it on
my youtube and yeah let's just get
straight into today's video
okay so starting off with my eyebrows
today I'm going to be using the model
car eyebrow pencil I guess it kind of
looks like the anastacio one like the
applicator for it so I'm just going to
go straight in on in here on my brows
this is a really friggin good at like
defining your brow like I'm sorry what
okay yes we are bringing back these
seeker slugger brows and I'm living for
them not a problem
I'm also just going to take a little bit
of powder and just kind of just fill in
those little parts of my eyeballs ratney
sticker you know nothing too extreme
okay once at my eyebrows are all done
let's do my eyes okay
so there's actually a few things that I
wanted to touch on in today's video my
base I was gonna be using the Kat Von D
love it concealer
um a few things I want to talk about
number one let's just let's just let's
just put it all out on the table let's
just get it done let's talk about it
even though I hate talking about it
because I'm literally over and I'm sure
you guys are too my instagram my
instagram so basically what happened the
first time it disappeared completely
back like I'm told them like a month ago
this happened it just got an influx of
reports and when you get a massive
amount of reports in a specific time
frame Instagram literally just disables
your account and you need to like appeal
against it to get your account back
which is kind of what I did I had a few
people helping me and if only you guys
knew what I had to go through to get
that page back the first time Oh
anyway moving on and then came the
hackings now I still don't know to this
des how the they managed to get
back in three times like how is that
possible how is that possible
anyway it turns out I'm pretty sure I
know what it was it was my password it
was just too short I think that now like
I don't even what I feel like we're
talking about it but I even just hate
talking about it and I know how they got
in now it literally was just my password
that's all I want to say like I feel
really uncomfortable talking about it
but I'm yeah it was just my password it
was too short and they were obviously
like working it out all they had some
sort of hacking program I'm not really
sure but it actually got to say bored
again at two nights ago and I was like a
yeast Innes serious I've had
enough I do not have time to think about
people hacking my I do not have
time to be messaging Instagram
and spamming their emails 20 times a day
because Instagram is literally
impossible to get ahold of anyway so I
managed to get it back again and the
reason why I got to stable again because
a lot of people obviously or a specific
person I don't know who it was I don't
know how they managed to do it but if
they report your account hundreds of
times it does automatically just get
disabled and the first time it ever
disappeared like a month ago as I was
saying before someone had reported my
account seven hundred times and I could
give you the realty on that because
just the connections and the people that
I know that can more or less find out
okay all right I'll just stop now and so
anyway as I was saying earlier the first
time it did get reported someone
reported my account literally over 700
times I mean who has the time to do that
700 times over 700 times I mean just
really sad say no more Michael let's
just say that if you know people in the
industry you're very lucky
okay moving on I'm just going to be
blending out my eyeshadow base with my
Beauty Blender I'm just going to set
over that concealer with a little bit of
the Australia special for lawless this
so it does not move moving on to my
eyeshadow say I'm going to be busting
out of this baby has since you jeffree
star cosmetics and George
pallette irony is this once on my
channel ever since it came out i've you
still a lot like behind the scenes when
i haven't been filming or whatnot but um
i literally love it and i should be
using it more often i don't really know
what look i'm going to go for today but
i don't really want to do warm brown but
it'll probably happen but i don't want
it to so I'm actually just going to dip
into safe word to start off with and I'm
going to start popping this in my cruise
these blends so well what else can we
talk about oh my god key I literally had
no idea how assented people can get by
me saying queue or just anyone thank you
like it's just one of those
stupid things that me and shiny kind of
just made up and you know it's just said
a lot now I will just drop my boss it's
just said by a lot of people now and you
know just different scenarios like one
time when me and Shaunie were in Bali
and I was really drunk and we're going
back to the hotel and I was walking past
every single door going okay the amount
of people that have done that is that it
to me on Twitter is amazing when you
guys like coffee scenarios like that it
 kills us like we die we love it
so much and just like when you get your
parents to say like Benji come here now
hilarious hilarious you guys are
great I guess so many people get so
offended by it like I did not know it
was such an offence 15 as I said
something on Twitter this morning and
it's literally a status that someone's
amazing can people stop saying Q or
thank you Michael Finch ain't well
I mean obviously if it's getting to the
point where you need to make a status it
must be a lot of people and getting
really annoying so if that means that I
ain't then you can eat my ass so
I'm still blending safeword into my
crease and like deepening it up it
really is very like buildable and like
you can really pack the color on and
build it up as you go now I'm going to
dip into a little bit of fetish which is
this beautiful brown brown it's like my
Rory and I don't know I'm gonna just
pass that on to my outer-v
actually just went and picked up a
coffee I know it's only like okay it's
12:02 p.m. in the afternoon but I'm like
really exhausted really
exhausted anyway guys that is only three
more days until I move because
we going up on Monday three more days
guys I'm so excited
honestly though like it's gonna be
really sad like I'm going to miss my
family and my friends here so much like
I have such a strong relationship like
with majority of my friends here I don't
really see them all the time but we
still have a really strong friendship do
not I mean like all I'm just going to
miss them so much I can always come down
here and visit you know what I mean the
person I'm going to miss the most is my
mom I mean I'm such a mummy's boy
because it's my first time like living
out of home interstate by myself yes I'm
moving in by myself for those who are
asking I'm not living with anyone
because that I've always one of my
own like personal space I don't want
anyone to be home when I'm filming I
don't want to have to live with
housemates and you know be texting them
saying when you're coming home and
they're like I'll be home in 45 minutes
and I've sort of films I've got to rush
my video I guess you're just
 texting me Ronnie
 interrupting everything all
 time and I'm literally over it
fine goes on silent and you don't get a
reply for the next two hours not a
problem
now I'm gonna be taking the shade called
deja vu and I'm just going to spritz my
brush a little bit of d'Ã©tat Julie skin
miss just to like wetting that up a
little bit
and then I will just go to town on my
lid King yes okay guys I'm going to do
wings learn about it today I'm just
going to do that off camera just to save
time in the video so I'm going to pop
some wing bones we're going to fly away
and then I will BRB ok ok now that my
wings are on let's get started on
everything else
so for primer I'm going to be using the
Bobbi Brown vitamin enriched face base
I'm not using so I'm just going to dip
the asshole end of my Beauty Blender
into that and I'm going straight on in
oh my god it smells as good if you ever
have a chance to smell this do it
because it's amazing why the actual
on my lips so chapped and dry we are not
going to be doing any matte lips today
because this mmm
making keep moving on to foundation I'm
actually gonna be testing out a new one
that I bought the other day this is the
l'oreal true match foundation i see so
many people rave and rant about this so
um let's give it a whirl and see what
happens
ok or coverage is good color is good ok
I'm liking this so far so far so good
you know it would be awesome if I did
find a drugstore foundation that I could
use
like when I go out or I just quickly do
my makeup or something like that because
I always use high-end foundations dis
foundations like concealer okay
I'm just going to quickly conceal the
tops of my brows just with this
foundation well okay now that my
foundation is all I'm sorry perhaps of
that foundation by the way I really need
to get some concealer on because I'm
looking literally dead so it's going to
take some of the touch shape tape of
straight under the eyes trying to work
out my like why my lips are so chapped I
think it's because it's like winter and
it's cold and that always happens in
that weather so we're going to blend all
this concealer and then I'm going to go
straight in on and set this okay now to
set my under eyes and my t-zone I'm just
going to be taking the courier's gun
powder but I'll powder have a music baby
in a while and I wonder why because the
packaging so cooked and it
literally and it like assholes
but I kind of like the smell so I'm just
going to take my Beauty Blender and just
go straight up in on me by the way guys
this foundation has just won my
heart I'm just going to take more of
that Purdy airspun and just kind of
bounce all over my face and just set the
rest of my face because if I put any
more foundation on I'm lips and I look
about that cake even more right at this
present moment I'm so mad and I'm living
for it I'm just going to finish off
under my eyes and take a little bit of
dominatrix and just pop it right up
against my lower lashline
okay so I'm going to quickly pop on some
mascara today I'm just going to be using
benefits roller lash okay I'm moving it
to contour I'm simply taking a little
bit of benefits hoola light just to
chisel out my face a little bit so if
you guys follow me on my other social
media you would know that I have been
eating healthy and you know trying to
lose weight and you know feel better in
myself so what I've been doing is
literally just eating healthy I haven't
been exercising or anything because okay
poor excuse but just during our time at
the moment I've got a lot going on you
know but once I've moved and settled in
there is actually a gym in the apartment
that I've moved into so I'll be able to
go through whenever I want so that's
going to be so good and I'm really
excited because you know that feeling
you get after you workout you feel so
good in yourself and you just feel like
really energetic that's the feeling that
I'm looking forward to the most
oh my god and I'm actually going to see
my lip lady tomorrow because I am going
to get my lips done again because I have
not had my lips done in such a long time
and I just need some wine them you know
what I mean like you know you can never
have too much well you're probably don't
take you can just come on so I'm gonna
go get my lips done again give them a
bit of a top-up all that sort of jazz
you know it's going to run a little bit
down the side of my nose because it did
get lost in all that concealer and
foundation I used I don't need to bring
it back you know what I mean so it lost
down on not a problem okay moving on to
bronzer I'm going to be taking the
toothpaste milk chocolate Soleil light
medium matte bronzer and I'm just going
to dip it in and just kind of pop a
little bit more on I love it when it
goes in my mouth if you guys don't know
this is like 99% cocoa powder or
something so it smells and tastes
amazing it always drops into your mouth
off the brush and it's just the best
thing ever it's like a little treat you
know what I mean so yeah why don't you
move in a few days I'm going to be
starting to do videos like what I eat in
a day and stuff like that it's gonna be
a lot easier because I will be living by
myself so I won't have anyone to like
you know get in my way or anything like
that so I'm really excited because I
know you guys want to know what's in my
green juice and I can show you all that
once I've moved and I'm so excited so I
just want to help people I just want to
inspire people like feel happy with the
way you are that's fine I'm happy for
you I'm happy with the way that I am but
there's always room for improvement you
know what I mean so in saying that
that's why I am you know starting to
look after my health a little bit more
and you feel so much better in yourself
like you wake up in the morning and you
just feel so much better see what I mean
see all the brush hairs like all over my
shirt from this morphe brush now for a
little bit of blush and just add a
little bit of color I'm going to be
taking this Tarte blush in the shade at
the list full and I'm just going to pop
a little bit of that on my cheeks now

somethin'-somethin I'm just going to
take the tatcha luminous dewy skin mists

face now for a little bit of highlighter

bit oh yeah that's nice nice a bit of a
glow well there we go oh my god it's
nice and as well all over my whole
 face now for my lip color today
