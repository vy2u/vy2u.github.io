today I'm gonna be doing a full glam
clubbing get ready with me now I have
not done a club and get running with me
in quite a while and I love doing these
videos because I'm like getting all
riled up only thing is I'm getting
really really quite early so I'm not
drinking anything yet because once I
start I can't stop drama but anyone
who's like that so yeah today I'm going
for like a bronze no not bronze like a
coppery sort of like look I don't really
know what I'm doing but I want full
coverage everything whoa there go so
knowing before I go clubbing I want my
teeth to be super duper white and
flawless not yellow at all from all the
coffee that I drink so what I like to
use to whiten my teeth before I go is
that hello smile teeth whitening pen I
have tried so many teeth whitening pens
in my life like literally so many and
I've actually finally found one of the
best ones that I've ever come across so
if you're interested in getting this
I'll leave a link down below for you
guys and if anyone who wants a little
bit more information on this I'll just
give you guys a few quick talking points
just so you don't have to read it all on
the website basically has all natural
and organic ingredients this is
sensitive free so it's very very good on
if you've got any bad areas in your
mouth it won't affect them at all and
this is also animal cruelty free which
I'm sure a lot of you will love because
I know a lot of my friends love that as
well about this this is also very very
portable so you can take a wherever you
go I've got about four of these and I
take them where everywhere I go when I
go away like literally you can just put
this in your bag it's like it's
literally a pen and typical I've got
lipstick on it that just shows it's not
color what that was I've showed you guys
on Instagram how to do this before but
basically all you need to do is you just
wind up until you get the product out
and then I just paint it onto my teeth
luckiest
ha so after 20 minutes then I rinse my
mouth out about 20 minutes half an hour
depends on what sort of like depends on
what I can be bothered doing I think you
normally need about 20 minutes but I
only drew 30 minutes just because I want
to and then I have nice white teeth and
then when you're on the floor in the
club everybody can look at your teeth
and spot you from a mile away
what sorry let's get into the makeup
sorry for my face primer today I'm just
going to be using toothpaste hangover
primer this is sorry I think this menu
favorite primer I've really used a few
times when I feel like it's so
moisturizing it's basically a
moisturizer but it's marketed as as a
primer but there's nothing wrong about
absolutely love it then I'm just going
to be taking a little bit of benefit
Porefessional and putting that into my
teaser in areas where my large pores are
which is basically everywhere on my face
basically just on my whole t-zone area
pretty much I'm just going to give my
face a few squirts a mac fix+ and we're
going almost out of this it's making me
so sad if you guys watch my channel for
a while you know how much I love this
stuff don't know why I just do smells
like 60 cucumbers whatever now because I
am quite fake tan at the moment I am
matching my face to my neck which is it
much different unfortunately I didn't
put much turn on don't know why because
normal have to be super super tan but um
yeah I'm going to be doing a bit of
matching matching today so for my
foundation today I'm just going to be
using the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation kind of fallen back in love
with this foundation my first try I was
like it's disgusting but turns out it's
got a color that wasn't for me guys this
is in the shade honey which is like I
think it's like almost one of the
darkest ones so I'm just going to take
this excerpt Beauty paddle foundation
brush squirt a little bit of this
foundation onto the back of my hand I'm
actually going to do my eyes last today
which is what I never ever do I just
feel like I'm changing
you know I saw over the edge of my
eyebrow see you later' tail I'm going to
 up my beauty blender
I hate it when I do that I always sit
down and then I have to get back up
because I forgot to wear my Beauty
Blender then I did one dad it's got
makeup setting spray and just drenched
it because I literally couldn't be
getting up and wetting it that bad so
lazy goes slow lazy no as I said before
when I'm too lazy to get up and actually
wet my Beauty Blender I just get a
ton of makeup setting spray and drench
the absolute out of it and a left
they've been having to get off my fat
ass so there's a little tip for you guys
so we're lazy just like me you're
welcome
probably doesn't work properly but over
they don't care then I'm just taking my
dead Beauty Blender yeah this hasn't
done the job but that's fine and if you
are matching your fake tan to your
foundation or whatever make sure you try
and blend it into your hairline to the
best of your ability I would say the
coverage on its foundation is medium to
full I don't really know it but I like
it makes my eyes look real green so
bright yellow trying to small like
orange trying about what I really like
about it to highlight and contour today
I'm going to be using the iconic London
cream contour palette I'm just going to
be taking this a lighter shade in the
palette this is kind of like it it
starts to choose we can still in a way
and I'm just going to pack this under up
Matt our area yeah you definitely don't
need concealer when it comes to this the
wall I'm just going to put a little bit
down the side tip of my nose my forehead
my chin and Cupid's bow so just a little
bit under here for good luck you know
now I'm going to be dipping into this
shade right here
and I'm just going to be doing like a
slight I'm sure I'm not that confident
like on strip cream contouring with um
dark shades
because this is kind of acting like a
concealer but when it comes to this it
kind of worries me a little bit now
should blend this out it's going to
taking my morphe 49 brush and I'm just
going to start with the lightest shade
first you can kind of blend this in
little circles with this brush like I
feel like it works super well so I'm
just kind of leaving the center the most
pigmented here so it's kind of like a
big ball in the middle of my forehead to
join under my eyes I'm actually just
going to take my damp Beauty Blender now
to blend the darker shades I'm just
taking the morphe g35 brush and just
blending that all better
basically what cream contouring does in
my opinion it makes it last longer and
it doesn't throw patchy not that my
contour normally goes patchy but I feel
like this just helps quite a lot so to
set my under eyes I'm just going to be
using my awesome area called powder guys
I live for this I live I live Bailey so
basically I just take my damp Beauty
Blender and pop it up in there I love
baking my forehead I'm like obsessed
with doing it now and my nose bridge as
well and where my smile lines perfect I
get them fixed now to set the rest of my
face I'm just taking a stroll as fresh
and flawless pressed out of the shade
medium tan if you guys don't know I'm
obsessed with this powder it's so cheap
so affordable and when it's on special
and like canvas warehouse and Priceline
they're like if you're not from
Australia they're stores we have in
Australia it comes down to literally
seven dollars solid wood now for my eye
base today I'm just going to be using
the Maybelline anti age rewind concealer
this is in the shade or in a medium I
think and I'm just going to be popping a
bit of that on my eyelids to use as an
eye base today just doom you guys a
little bit so you can see a bit better
then I'm just blending out with my
coffee g35 brush I'm just dabbing that
in there I feel like when you dab it's
better than like sweating it all around
oh my god it's raining outside
better be raining when we're out
clubbing because I'm not going to be
happy just going to dip into a little
bit of pasty MA and pop put on the
generous turnout you know
and just set my eyelids to make sure
they are not going anywhere or creasing
now I know I do a lot of warm turns and
oranges but I really want this to just
be playing orange and like not much Brad
at all I'm gonna leave you guys as you
can see a bit better coming now beneath
being an Ori girl I'm going to see bindi
next week I'm so excited I've caught
some excited to see Shani - but bindi
she's been a naughty girl
so I'm just taking Peach Smoothie um
through my cruise through Malik release
and just kind of blending that out and
up just to use a bit of a transition on
saying I don't want to use modern
Renaissance
last time I went out clubbing I bought
up I think I felt that you - what but
everyone was like watching your eyes
icon gods but understaffed yeah
modernized off my life lady get that
from Mike I just I literally bought it
from our star tears website a lot of
people ask me where to get it from you
can only buy it from under star Tia's
website if you're paying with credit
card as they don't accept paypal for us
Australians anymore so that's probably
why it wasn't working for you if you've
tried but yeah I just buy off her future
websites I know I'm getting the real
deal so as I just said before I'm gonna
be dipping into the anistar TR Modern
Renaissance palette and I'm gonna get
the colour called real guard just here
just on my blending brush capping off
the excess that you don't need and
straight in with that color called
realgar straight through the lid crews
so bad that I laugh at myself sometimes
I don't know why is it raining wasn't
meant to rain on so days so annoying the
more you drink the more you won't know
true true
now I'm just going to take a little bit
of a slight press one bar which is the
brown shade just a really tiny bit of
brown because I said I didn't want much
browning here because I just wanted to
find my crease a little bit I'm just
going to go back in with some of that
orange just to blend that Brown out you
know I actually really love doing chatty
videos I just have to be in the mood for
it and I'm going out clubbing so of
course I'm gonna be in the mood for it
yeah you guys are my little cat ears by
the way but I'm from came out they were
like $10 adding a cute um what the
is that on the end of my nose has I been
there the whole time that is so
embarrassing oh my are you kidding
where did that come from
okay now we're going to be moving on to
my eyelid area and I'm just gonna be
taking a Mac pigment in the shade cover
sparkle guys this is stunning if you
want a pigment it's copper that's really
really nice 100% this so I'm just going
to take some of copper sparkle on my
brush and spray that with a bit of fix+
and I'm gonna go straight in for it onto
my lid area oh my god you guys like what
is life
Ashley what is life I'm just bringing
that across all the way into my inner
corner and kind of just blending that
this is a pigment so it's kind of easy
to blend you know I mean like it's not
chunky
I'm actually bringing that up over
through my crease up here and just
blending over the edge with that brush
lo use before perfect so that's all
sitting on that super orange super glam
now I'm just going to be using a disc
lick here from a brand called OPEB this
is actually a pressed glitter and I
don't think you need any glue with it it
kind of just sticks on so I'm just
popping that glitter just on my lid area
a bit sticking quite well with no glue
which is perfect so we're just gonna go
ahead and use no blue all those is so
pretty actually are basically
just what Lauren was my whole lid
because I don't care I feel like that
was so cool just going back into my
other Stassi on moderation wants a
palette I'm just going to take that flat
out orange color just gonna go straight
in for it and I'm just going to place
that underneath my thigh perfect then
I'm just going to be taking a little bit
more Brown just so just to kind of turn
down the orange a little bit just bit
more of that brown color there I'm
trying to draw
not underneath my I don't even want to
do wings today I just want to do this as
well ashes on now I'm just gonna take a
little bit of eyeliner actually got this
in the mail today this is the scandal
eyes liner by Rimmel they're always
coming up with new eyeliners so I'm just
gonna do a little straight line across
the top of my lash line just on my
lashes blend in a little bit better I'm
sorry attempted to do a wing right now I
just can't do it so I'm just gonna be
taking up my Mac extended play gigablack
lash mascara for my lashes today yeah oh
my god this looks so nice this glitter
holy I'm actually so impressed with
myself right now for my lashes today I'm
going back to my all-time favorite
lashes brand and style get the packaging

Miami guys these are incredible I
actually do have a discount code I'll
leave it on the screen now gives you 10%

fluffy long and stunning they look so
good for my lash glue today I'm just
going to be using my favorite lash glue
which is the hassle of lashes black lash
Cleary and then just plenty generous
them out onto the end of that just gonna
zoom you guys in so you can watch me put
this on basically what I do is I just go
oh oh I thought that and
then I kind of close my eyes I pop it on
oh I just got black lash glue
everywhere
okay that is what you don't want to
happen I'll show you how to fix that
after this is how you fix it I just like
get more line on okay it I'm just
going to do a wing I kind of have to
know just a little cute wing and that is
how you fix it if you your eyeliner
up okay now that we're done with the
eyes completely understaffing off all of
that fall out bake getting a more denser
brush and just brushing that all away to
contour today I'm just going to be using
my benefit hoola bronzer or Halla face
powder as it's not that bronze you can
call it whatever you want I feel like I
never used this koala bronzer anymore
words about the Anasazi are contour
palette
definitely
holy surrender what you control it
at your nose a little trick that I like
to do is I just take my foundation
powder I'll just grab any brush and I
just kind of dust it over and it seems
to diffuse everything and make it look a
little bit more natural just give it a
shot trust me it works and it looks so
good now
this banana powder I'm trying out this
actually sent from her subscribers so
thank you so much Vic this is the w7
banana dreams I believe this is from you
can get w7 from campus warehouse it's
extremely extremely affordable so I'm
just going to tip a little bit a little
bit of that into the lid of the
container of the banana powder and I'm
just going to brush it oh my god guys
this is actually nice this isn't all
that bad just highlights underneath the
eyes quite nicely and I'm just placing
it up on my forehead to my nose bridge
and my chin for my highlight of today
I'm just going to be using dry cosmetics
star powder which is like a highlighter
in the shade Brigitte I haven't used
this in a long time and where the first
time I use this I absolutely obsessed
and I've completely forgotten about it
don't know how that happens it just does
what I'm going to do better just spray
my cheeks with a bit of v plus I just
saw it's a bit wetter for the
highlighter to stick to then the bridge
I feel like when you put a dot of
highlighter on here make sure brings
your nose up so it gives it like a more
like beading nose and it makes it look a
little bit smaller in my opinion I'm not
going to do blush today simply just
because I'm not in the mood for it but
for my lip color I am going to be using
Kat Von D bow-and-arrow have not used
this in a hot minute either perfect now
to set everything in place I'm just
going to be using the eye cream makeup
fixer setting spray letting that dry off
sort of like a sweaty pig in my pouch
I'm sorry this is that finished look I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
enjoyed me doing a bit of a chatty
tutorial I'm actually obsessed with this
orange and like copper glittery sort of
look and these lashes just make
everything so much better if you guys
did enjoy this video please don't forget

you guys so much and I'll see you on my
