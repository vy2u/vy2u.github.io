have been sick for the past few days so
I haven't been able to film I'm filming
a little bit better now so I'm gonna see
if I can get straight back into attack
and reduce some new content for you guys
so today I'm just gonna be sitting down
chatting to you guys about I don't
really know but I have some new products
that I want to try out and I want to
kind of do like a full makeup look
except a dark lip because if like dark
lips really do not suit me so I was
gonna go for a nude lip surprise
surprise so leggo so I'm gonna start
with the Maybelline anti age rewind
concealer just to use as my eye base
today incorporating them drugstore
products you know what I'm talking about
and blending that out with my Beauty
Blender Oh while we're on the topic of
drugstore products the video that I made
that was called full face makeup using
only my mother's makeup I don't know
what I hate on that because um predator
come across as very up myself and
disrespectful towards my mother
that's actually my sense of humor and a
lot of people knowing that and a lot of
people obviously don't know that and for
everyone saying that I'm disrespectful
to my mother and people haven't got me
for scraping off some powder from a
pressed powder um that's actually
ridiculous cuz I showed my most comments
and she does laughs so you're really
making a fool of yourself hon mother I
should really have to address that at
all but I thought I would just to
whatever
for my eyes today I'm just going to be
taking the morphe 35o palette which is
that stunning right um and I want to do
like burgundy and maroon colors but
there's not really much in here they're
all kind of shimmery I have any shimmery
colors dramatic realities so we've only
kind of got these brown ones at the top
here so I think I'm gonna be diving into
a few of these and then a lunar makeup
geek adjust so I can get the desired
look okay but I'm just going to be
dipping into this peachy sort of color
here oh it looks exactly like
Peach Smoothie
from bug and I'm just going to be
dragging that through my cruise why do
you guys think it's so funny when I say
that like I'm such an idiot a lot of
people say it sounds like a think in
which it does I know this is kind of
like old news to talk about now but what
does everyone think about the YouTube
rules I mean good luck stopping me
throwing that's not going to happen the
only time I will stop swearing as if
it's going to jeopardize my channel
getting deleted I don't care if I don't
get paid for my videos I'm not fast but
um yeah if it's gonna risk my channel
getting deleted then that's what I'll
have to stop because I want to always
produce new content for everybody
because I enjoy it now on a more dense
sort of brush I'm just gonna be taking
this warm brown color luckiest dragging
that just above my cruise but I really
know what I'm doing right now like I
don't know what's actually happening
with this makeup I'm just kind of going
for it and just chatting to everyone
about random why is it so hot today
I feel like I'm sweating a little bit I
think it's because I'm just still
getting over my cold and like you know
when you're actually cold but like
you're sweating so bad I think that's me
right now oh my god I'm a soldier and I
haven't even like books anything yet
holy I really should do that
actually just the point at Jeffrey's not
going to be a high match this year a lot
of places that I really wish to be
they're like are gonna be there this
year it's kind of disappointing but I'm
still gonna be going sigh well that's
always good fun yeah I'm going to be
dipping into makeup geek bitten and just
taking a little bit of that and walking
back born like right out of the area and
kind of dragging it through the crease I
don't know what this is gonna end up
looking like you guys it's like I
actually have
no idea just because I want to break the
rules a little bit I'm going to be
taking this shade of right here from the
morphe palette and I'm going to be
putting it through my crease like a
shimmery color through my crease I'm
basically going against everything I've
ever said before but I stock highly
bible exact if that's how you say her
last name her new tutorial she literally
used all shimmery colors all through a
crease like basically up to the rubber
and and I was like oh my gosh oh I'm
just putting that on my lid as well you
see I'm doing it then I was going to
take a little bit of the black shade
from the morphe palette and I'm just
putting that on my data crease and I
don't want this to be like noticeable
but I've block like there so I kind of
want to really like dissolve that into
the cranberry color by doing this it's
just gonna add more dimension and also
it's not going to overpower the color
that you've already put down this is
just me or just everyone have like a
good idea that I like I love doing
makeup on this like here I've never
blends like it's harder to do I'm sure
you all know what I'm talking about now
for my lip color I'm just gonna be
taking this rose gold Easter shanky are
absolutely perfect study now I'm just
taking a generous amount of that and
just straight on the lid
Amy look at that and then just cuz I
want to live a little bit later I'm just
gonna be taking a little bit of this
white shake here and just popping that
on the top as well don't you just love
it when someone watches you on Facebook
being like oh hi how are you I'm just a
question like no that's re me typing
message me when you want something slide
archive or archive is that archive or I
don't know whatever yeah let's get under
my eyes cleaned up because it looks like
a bush pig mess I'm just gonna be taking
a little my little little man a little
bit of my Maybelline studio gel liner
just to run that across the top of my
eye just to put there so the lashes can
blend into something now for my mascara
today I'm gonna be trying out a new
mascara just at Urban Decay perversion
of Muskaan just bigger blacker and
badder let's see how this goes dude when
you first get a mascara it's very like
wet like it's not at that midpoint of
wet or dry it's actually really good at
lengthening the lashes and making them
super jet black okay once I mascaras on
I'm gonna get my lashes
because I literally cannot think without
having eyelashes on for my lashes these
are the iris Beauty lashes in the style
fearless and they're so long I'll show
you the close-up as always when I get a
new pair of lashes I just cut them down
to my size just so they fit my eye shape
and they're not digging in or anything
nasty like they're I just take them in
my lash tweezers and a bit of the black
House of lashes lash glue let that dry
for about a minute and a half so it's
super tacky okay now that my eyes are
all done in my last will actually top -
my eyes are done the bottom Sonia let's
move on to primer I'm just going to be
going back to my la girl pro prep HD
primer this is so cheap I get all my la
girl stuff from Lady Moss hashtag not
sponsored umm but yeah that's right a
little from and I'll be buying like bulk
and you can get Milani products on there
I think lady muscles shot me say I'm not
sure I'm pretty sure this is a super so
I don't even read the ingredients but
I'm pretty sure this is super silicone
based um because it feels like there is
a rubber on your skin what the does
my eyelash keep getting stuck down there
now B need for my foundation today I'm
going to be using the Marc Jacobs
remarkable foundation this is this is in
the shade bisque light so it's I'm not
tan so I'm not using an orange
foundation so Instagram is gonna love
the fact that I'm using something that's
actually my skin color so this is so
weird like you open it and it's just
like a little Doody stick like there's
no like drop or anything so you've just
got to kind of plop it on and hope for
the best
now I do want to use a brush to blend
this out because I know it's going to be
a thick foundation I'm not very full
coverage as well where the fuck's my
brush does this involve me having to get
off my fat ass again and find something
it's like really calm before okay to
blend this in today i'm gonna be using
the morphe g36 brush because a beauty
butter is just not gonna cut it today
your place this week to have you'll be
to cut it so I'm just gonna be popping
that now I'm just gonna put a little bit
on just like and show you guys how good
the coverage is ready
I'll take lash like that's sorry good
and I actually feel like this is my this
is not too yellow I really hope it
doesn't I have a feeling as oxidizers I
swear I heard someone say oxidizers like
a little bit but even though you're only
gonna tidy but of course I'm gonna put
up a ton of it on so as I'm
blending this in the coverage is just so
great for my under-eye concealer where
the is my gone this way why do I
keep losing everything what's going on
what's happening for my under eye
concealer I'm just gonna be using the
bone this way you can still live in the
shade light just apply that in the usual
areas under my eyes just taking my damp
Beauty Blender again and just starting
to blend that out
gah gah gah gah gah gah born speaking of
gaga gaga gaga gaga um guess who is
making an appearance in Melbourne within
the next few weeks it is your queen from
New Zealand if you guys think me and
Chris should make a video together let
me know in the comments below because
I'm down for it
I feel like we would bag that absolute
 out of each other and a lot of
people would take it serious a lot of
people like you know our personalities
that we're not being serious okay once
my under-eye concealer and everything is
blended out are they going to be going
into my our CMA no color powder just to
set everything because it's the best to
set everything with so I'm not making
too much today I'm kind of just going a
little bit under my eye I'm kind of just
down that makes sense now she set the
rest of my face I'm going to be using
the Australia's fresh and flawless press
powder in the shade deep natural this is
more of a pale sort of skin color which
is what I am today dull and I'm just
dabbing that product in rather than
swirling because I don't want to move
the foundation that's already there I
don't want to move that around okay now
we're going to zoom you guys in and I'll
just gonna shove my under eye area so
then really what I'm doing is just
taking this cranberry color here that I
used earlier and I'm just putting that
straight underneath my lower lash line
up quite hard or accept the silence
and listen to the background music so I
always get something why I always and
then just taking a little bit of that
Brown and just straight underneath that
cranberry color and for a little bit of
an inner corner highlight I'm just going
to be taking this a lighter shade here
and I'm just going to be putting that
straight on regular qalam now to contour
today I'm just gonna be using the makeup
geek contour in the shade half hearted
then to do this I'm just using my zoeva
once you set a lot luxe cheek shear this
is the best with the jaw line up there
it is well there it is just contouring
my forehead slightly and a little bit on
the side of my nose nothing too extreme
today I'm just going to be sweeping off
that under I've baked that I've had
there for a little bit I'm not going to
be bronzing today simply because I don't
really own any bronzers that are like
for pale skin that aren't like warm
tones so if you guys know that I'm not
warm toned if you guys know what I'm
talking about do you guys know any
bronzers or anything that are very cool
toned still off the skin but they're not
George can you let me know down below
because I'm really into look out for
however for blush today I'm just going
to be using this mallow cosmetics blush
in the shade bronze hopefully just gives
me a bit of like a bit of a more bronzed
look without being overpowering really
really like fear so I'm just gonna bring
a little bit across my forehead to just
because I feel like it really has
Bronston without you know making it
Orange
now I'm going to be going back into my
pressed powder from Australis and I was
going to be doing a bit of a
nikkietutorials little trick what she
likes to do subscriber dense brush and
she just goes back into her powder and
she just kind of goes underneath the
contour so it doesn't bake it it's not
that harsh but it does clean it up then
she likes to go over the top and then
just over the top in general and it like
cools everything down like it's not too
intense for my bottom lashes I'm just
going to be using my Mac extended play
gigablack lash for my highlight today
I'm gonna be dipping into Jeffrey's Star
King Tut I have not used this at a
 about dinner so I'm kind
of keen I thought this would be true
dark coming today but it's actually
perfect so I'm kind of bringing it down
to the apples of my cheeks tree to give
me like more
healthy looking glow okay now we are
looking up almost done I'm just going to
be taking the UH Nastasia liquid
lipstick in the shade stripped now to
lock everything in place so I was going
to be using my trustworthy own Decay all
nighter makeup setting spray well
actually that's the first time it's ever
got in my mouth probably cuz I opened it
but that actually tastes disgusting that
tastes like poison that actually tastes
like poison sorry this is the finished
look I hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you did don't forget to give me a
massive thumbs up I love you guys so
much and I'll see you all in my next
video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
