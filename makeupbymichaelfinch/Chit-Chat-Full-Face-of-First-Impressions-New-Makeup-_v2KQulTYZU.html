Oh what my god it feels so good to be
home although I driller Brisbane it's
good to be back home and filming again
sitting down and chatting to all of you
guys so today I really wanted to do
another chit chat get ready with me
however today's gonna be a little bit
different because I'm going to be doing
a full face size my brows and like a few
little things that I don't have that a
new of full face the first impressions
so I hope you guys enjoy this video and
let's get straight into it oh by the way
excuse my ratchet fake ten hands and my
missing nail if you guys have me on
snapchat you know what happened when I
was drunk I was clubbing and I stabbed
it into someone and then right back to
the root and lifted up and it was all
pasty and infected and it was rank I
just can't deal I'm getting my nails
done on I don't know when sometimes this
week or next week so you're not gonna
have to deal with this for much longer
so the first product I'm going in with
today is the Bobbi Brown
vitamin-enriched a face base I've seen
Jeffery use this so much and feel my
friends have used it and they said that
it's quite nice so I'm just going to
give this a shot I've got to work my
Beauty Blender y'all know what that
means actually no I really should wear
it this time because I'm is quite dry
now I need to wear this it's so dry
I'll be back okay my Beauty Blender is
all wet so what I've seen people do is
they just take their Beauty Blender
straight in to the primer and just wow
this smells so refreshing mmm so
actually one more dabbing why am i
dabbing that in so I'm just going to be
applying that straight into my face okay
so once that's all blended and I'm just
gonna be taking a bit of fix+ and I do
have another one of these I just don't
know where it's gone mmm I feel so
refreshed right now okay guys moving our
chickens Ella I'm just going to be using
the Kat Von D a lot of concealers in the
shade warm I have not tried this and I
have not seen many people use it so I'm
keen to try it out so I'm just going to
be concealing underneath my eyebrows
with this and also using it as an iron
base and it by the looks of it so far
the coverage is very very full just what
I love that's the whole point of
concealer don't we all know
well from what I can already tell this
one blur this concealer dries so quick
and it's very thick as soon as it's out
of that tube it's instant thickness
which I guess it's not a bad thing you
kind of need to work with a quick from
what I can tell so far I'm just going to
be taking my Beauty Blender again and
just blending that concealer right our
well this is actually really good
concealer you guys I'm impressed now
this is not a first impressions of this
product but I'm going to take a bit of
my RCM a no color powder just to lock
that into place so it doesn't move or
crease oh my shadow to sit nice and
seamlessly on my eye once my eye base is
all done and then going to be taking the
pewter Beauty texted shadows pal this is
the rose gold edition I just got this in
the post today and guys I'm telling you
I'm so excited to use this because this
is kind of like one of my few more cuter
beauty products but this is like one of
my first official products from them I
really want to try some of the liquid
lipsticks out but they always sold out
but I did all of this off their website
these guys do ship to Australia and you
can pay with PayPal which is awesome
because if you make some I swear you
couldn't like they didn't ship to
Australia but now they do so the first
color I'm taking is called sandalwood
and I'm just putting that through my
crease ah already these blend so well
like just I'd literally just applied on
it's already blended for me that is
amazing now I won't just look to be
really quite dramatic and like crazy but
I don't know what's happening I'm just
going to like kind of go for the jugular
and professed holy you guys these
blend so well and actually slow impress
so as you can see I'm bringing that out
quite far I'm so impressed just you just
out of using this one color where I've
focused a lot of that product it stayed
there but it's still blended at the same
time like it hasn't smeared too much and
I'm blending a lot oh my god yes
now I mean is excited since that
understands your modern renascence
palette are now I'm going into the shade
called henna just here and I'm
gonna be going back to my crease through
a mala Cruz I'm already done with this
palette like this palette has won me
over already
oh my god I'm so glad I got this either
those Basking but don't remember how
much it was but I think with shipping
and that it was like 120 130 that's
Australian dollars so that's if you if
you're in the u.s. it's cheaper
obviously because the currency whatever
it's cool so I'm just taking Hannah and
I'm putting that like in my outer-v
kind of keeping it down low because I
don't want to lose my transition and
sandalwood now just taking a bit of the
shade called bossy I'm just popping that
once again we're out of V or the outer
part of my lid and kind of just pulling
that in and kind of just up through the
crease ever so slightly now I'm just
gonna be taking a little bit of the
black color called black truffle and I'm
going to be mixing that with a bit of
header because I'm not sure how
pigmented this is and I don't want to
ruin this look and I'm just going to be
popping that smack there on the outer V
just on this little brush here oh you
guys I'm so excited with this palette
now for that palette I'm just going to
be taking the shade of rose gold and I'm
not going to be using any fix+ with this
because I feel like it's not necessary
because the shadows like these parts are
so sticky I'm just going to go straight
on okay so my opinion on this color key
I like the really foiled shadows they're
kind of hard to work with you're
probably better off applying it just
with your finger and then popping it
straight on rather than a brush because
it can go flaky so I feel like you get
the best pigment if you just use your
finger now moving on to eyeliner today I
don't really change up my eyeline as
much but today I did get the Tosh's taut
clay paint liner so I've seen patrick
star used is I'm just gonna assume you
guys are a little bit because I feel
like a bit too close I've seen patrick
star use this quite a lot so i'm going
to give this a whirl and what you do is
you just meant to squeeze it at the top
and i'm going to be taking this on my
zoeva 3:12 detail liner brush
holy those are genetic everyone
pray for me that this works out
so I think that's worked out quite well
this liner is kind of running in a way
and I've also done like a little in a
corner thing which I like about somebody
told you a bit later on Holi
it's the biggest thing I've ever done
now to get the other one even everybody
pray for me now for my mascara today I'm
going to be using the lights camera
lashes from Tarte
I also just got sent I got sent a bunch
of stuff from Tarte so shout out to Todd
I'm so blessed and these products that
I'm using so far are amazing this
mascara is really good at like
lengthening and really making the lashes
black
okay so now that my lashes are all I'm
ready to get started on my face now I
can talk a little bit more because it's
kind of hard talk when you do your eyes
I'm just speak like a mess you don't
want to it up anyway for my
foundation today I'm going to be
obviously matching it to my fake tan and
a lot of you guys ask me what fake tan I
use this is Bondi sands ultra dab this
is what it looks like this is their new
on and they do have a new tanning me
I'll just go and grab it sorry this is
the tanning mint that I use with it I
just basically put it on and put a few
pumps on I think this is like three
three layers of ultra dark or maybe true
I don't really remember but yeah it's on
my neck and I don't obviously tan
my face just because it brings
everything out and can make your
foundation look patchy but yes what I
use is bond essence ultra dark tanning
mousse energy's liquid gold sometimes
which is like another tanning product
and bond essence sorry back onto the
hand Asian I'm just going to be pumping
that a bit on the back of my hand I'm
all totally mixing into this a bit of
the Too Faced Born This Way Foundation
just so it does match my fake tan I'm
just going to be doing that all over of
my face once it is all evenly
distributed over my face and then just
going to take my foundation brush and
just blend that all in together instead
of concealing the top of my brows I'm
just going around with the foundation
brush just to clean them up a little bit
I can't really give you the first
impression of this Inglot foundation
when I mixed it with another one but I
had to because I wanted to Tim I wanted
to match my fake tan so now just back to
taking my damp Beauty Blender again I'm
just going to start blending all of this
foundation into my skin and really
getting it in there so as you guys know
I was in Brisbane for almost two weeks
spending time with shiny bindi John and
then Ronnie and jazz and sky and yes and
lily and ash and everyone and it was so
much fun we went out clubbing if you
guys have me on snapchat then you would
have seen all that be do coming boo um
snapchats when I was drunk oh my god we
literally did so many bindi come here
now
snapchats it was actually a joke I
didn't realize until how much how many
times I've said that until the next
morning
that's right we went to some awesome
clubs in Brisbane with like prohibition
Cloudland oh hello kind of gorge a love
club and if anyone lives in Brisbane and
you've been to Cloudland before that is
my favorite it's sorry nice and now our
mission is pretty good too
what the fuck's up with my eyebrow today
what happened to it once that is all
pointed out and then going straight back
in with my Kat Von D concealer in the
shade warm and this isn't warm hug this
is basically white now this does Drive
quite quick from what I've word before
so I'm just going to be doing bit by bit
no no that's actually really nice
brightening but not too much which is
exactly what I need I'm just going to be
taking that underneath both of my eyes
now very generously I love to go ham on
the concealer I hope this concealer
doesn't crease too much now select the
one thing I worry about when I get you
concealers we'll find out now to set my
under eyes I'm just gonna be taking a
bit more of my ice cream and I call it
powder I don't actually have a new
powder to test out and give you first
impressions on so if you guys know any
other than this one or the s-bahn all
the laura mercier then hit me up and let
me know because i'm always about trying
new powders I'm also just running that
bag down the side of my nose now to set
the rest of my foundation into place
today I'm going to be taking this
japonesque Foundation and powder if I
can open it so I'm just going to be
using this to set around the rest of my
foundation can't really locally and it
does look a little bit light for me but
this is the only one I have and I kind
of want to use as many products I can
that a new so I'm just going over the
rest of my foundation with this just to
set it all into place as you can see it
doesn't affect the color of my
foundation much which is exactly what we
wanted to contour today I'm just going
to be using this Tarte cosmetics contour
palette haven't used this before so this
is going to be like another first
impression obviously the whole point of
the video is first impressions so I'm
just going to be taking a bit of this
shake here and starting to just pop that
on my cheekbone area
so first impressions of this I'm very
very impressed with this palette this
contour shade is actually giving me so
much life I'm just going to contour my
nose a little bit true I do have a
separate video on that guys so if you
are interested in watching that I will
leave a link down below or just go
through my channel and you will find
that so I'm just going to do that and I
will be right back I'm just going to be
baking it under my contour just a little
bit I'm just going to put a little bit
down the side of my nose
once again no my friend jazz told me to
go all the way down to my mouth with my
bag so I'm going to start doing that and
see if it makes a difference let's see
how that goes
for my blush I'm just going to be taking
some of the blush out of the contour
palette here so a little bit on the
apples and blending back now for my
highlighter today because everybody
talks about this is Laura galas gilded
honey and I'm going to be taking on this
Anastasia Beverly Hills a 23 brush this
is a harder brush that everyone goes on
about how amazing it is so I want to see
when I think of that so I'm just going
to dip into the highlighter with no fix
plus and see what effect we get oh yeah
that's nice
now I see what people mean about this
highlighter brush it gets into all the
areas where you want it to go and it
doesn't just Spach too much of the
product now to take a better fix+ onto
my brush just to make it a little bit
more intense if this works well it
definitely does its didly didly want me
to Ben did Lee over just going to run a
little bit of that on my ears cause I
like highlighting the ear Thank You
bradman Rock now let's finish it off
underneath my eyes and then we'll do my
lips and then we're basically all done
so I'm going to zoom you guys in a touch
once again are basically just majority
on the top of my eyes directly on the
bottom
a little bit of the shank called bossy
now back in with the black shade called
black truffle
now I'm just going to dust off that
mouth baked or under contour back
whatever it's called I have to clean it
up a bit better than it normally would
for me and then just down the sides of
my nose again now for my bottom lashes
I'm just going to go back into the top
mascara that I used on my top lashes now
for my lip liner today I'm just going to
be taking her to beauty lip contour in
the shade trends that are now straight
over the top of that I'm just going to
be taking Anastasio Beverly Hills liquid
lipstick in the shade Aston now let's
just set everything in place I'm just
going to be taking the dry cosmetics lay
all day setting spray and this isn't a
much flavor color shade the flavor
green tea / ginger so this is the
finished look I don't know why this eye
