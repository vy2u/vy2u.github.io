today I'm just going to be sitting down
and chatting to you guys and just like
playing with makeup and just seeing what
I can come up with I kind of want to do
like a bronzy like coppery gold II sort
of glam look I don't really know but for
today's video I have teamed up with show
Co which is so cool because I love
shopping on show PO basically for those
who don't know what show PO is they sell
like jeffree star la girl Gerard
cosmetics socialised lashes Bondi sands
Australia and for those who don't know
how to get Australia I get a lot of
comments constantly about where do I buy
Australis from if you're not from
Australia the show pro does actually
ship worldwide so you can get it from
show PO which is also show port also
sells a lot of fashion stuff as well as
beauty and another really awesome thing
about sofa is they do ship at the world
wide so everyone can buy from Shoko
today I'm going to be using some
products from show post some products
I'm not but I will call out when I do
use products that you can get from show
PO and I also have some brushes here
that I got from them also and one last
thing I do also have a discount code it
is Michael 10 and I will be leaving the
link and website all information down
below to do is show great if you are
interested without any further ado let's
get straight into this video I'm really
excited because I've got some new
products to play with also let's do it
now I did just get my lashes tinted also
so I'm looking a little bit odd and my
eyebrows I just got them tinted as well
so they are a bit dark but they will
fade off a little bit and I also have my
green juice simply set V so for my brows
today I'm just going to be using G
precisely my brow pencil by benefit in
the shade number three this is one of my
favorites I don't really have to do much
to my brows we can say are quite filled
in already which I'm loving I cannot
wait to get my eyebrows tattooed one day
I was actually meant to get my brows
tattooed in February but I literally
just haven't had time because you can't
wear makeup for like two weeks or like
you totally do much for two weeks
because they're looking a little bit tax
so I'm I just haven't really had time
for it okay once my brows done let's
move on to my eyes yes I'm still missing
two nails - both fingers same hair like
hands both fingers bye so from my eyes
today I'm going to be using the morphe
35 k now if you are a regular watcher of
my videos you would know I use the 35
art and fell in love with it so I'm
going to be testing this baby out today
now don't come for me because I do want
to do kind of like a warm toned look and
I know I've done a lot of them but I've
got new products to play with and I want
to play with them and I really want to
do a one panel because I haven't done
one in a while I think don't come for me
so for my eye base today I'm going to be
using the a Lego concealer in the shade
porcelain and you can get this from shop
Bolcom is a discount code Michael 10
thank you I'm giving you guys I'm not
pushing with discount cards at all I
rarely ever tell you them I just tell
you them in case you were interested
every once in a blue moon right so what
I'm going to do is just conceal under my
brow then I'm going to take that same
concealer and just apply it all over my
lid for our base today you get it set
and then I was taking my damp yes damn I
got a light I just spritz it with some
makeup setting spray so I can't wallow
getting up I mean you guys are used to
it by now
I'm the worst at getting my lashes
tinted I always like I hate getting my
eyes closed for like a specific amount
of time and with some sleeping or
something and I got the last ten for my
fault
about lash in like all up here not good
not good now it's going to take a little
bit of pressed powder and just set my
lids so that does not move and when you
set your eyelid base of card is going to
allow your eyeshadows to be able to just
blend a lot better yes okay
moving into eyeshadows I'm going to be
taking this transitioning it sort of
shown up in the corner here and then I'm
just going to go straight in on my
crease and start to build up the color
I've honestly changed my views on these
morphe I shadows so much that I never
used to like them maybe I just didn't
give them a good enough go but now I'm
actually in love now I'm going to go in
with this darker sort of warm brown
shade and I'm just going to start
packing out on my outer V to bring some
definition back to the eye you know I'm
just going to blend that out with that
brush I was using before and just really
packing on that color and building it up
as I go
and then just blending on out again now
I'm just going to take a small little
definer brush and take that black shade
and I'm going to start packing that into
my outer corner and bringing it up for
Mike Ruiz then just going back in with
that color I just used before and I'm
just going to diffuse that black our
heart that's that is what I'm talking
about I'm just going to make sure this
is all blended at the top and I bought
it so high up I'm going to put some
higher there afterwards I can go and do
this eye and then I'll come back and
we'll get started on my lid color okay
guys now for my eye lid color today I'm
going to be using the multi pressed
pigment in the shade Radio Drive and I'm
honestly in love with these pigments
like they are that and good then I'm
just going to spray my brush with some
six-plus to wet the pigment and then get
back in a little bit more and then I'm
just going to go to town on my lid like
look at that like what and bring it
across my lid I'm just going to blend
around the edge with some of that Brown
that is her a little bit of sparkle I'm
just going to take a little bit of
glitter glue just on a small little
synthetic brush and I'm just going to
pop that over the middle and kind of
just dab around the edges a little bit
and then I'm going to dip straight into
the Mac gold glitter and just go
straight on my lid with that yes and
just kind of play around those are the
pigment we kind of laid the pigment down
to have like a base there otherwise it
would just be like see-through of
concealer and that does not
I'll bring the lives to life you know
what I mean hello yes love it now to do
my wing today because yes I am going to
be doing a wing because I just love
wings it just adds everything I'm going
to be taking the Engler IMC Jelena in
the number 77 now well I'll still do my
wing it's literally impossible to talk
so I'm just going to speed it up and
music over the top sir I'll BRB
okay now that my wings are all done I'm
going to get started on my face so to
print that I'm just going to be using
the maca prep and prime fix+ now for my
primer today I'm going to be using D a
Becca backlight primer because I used to
see other day and I was like whoa like
this makes your skin look so good and it
kind of does shine through the
foundation which I love and it's just
really moisturizing and Lok it just
gives your skin a nice glow to it I just
love it
now for my foundation I'm going to be
using the Tarte Amazonian clay full
coverage foundations is in the shade
light/medium and neutral and today I'm
not going to be using a Beauty Blender
because it's so thick I'm actually going
to be using my morphe g36 brush and I'm
just going to start blending this all in
I'm just going to conceal the tops on my
brows with this same foundation and then
I'm just going to keep blending the
foundation into my forehead now for good
luck I'm just going to take a little bit
more of that foundation on my Beauty
Blender and just blend all over
everything
and I really do excuse my hair today I
have no idea what's going on with it and
I don't think it does give up okay now
if you highlight my t-zone area and
conceal under my eyes I'm going to be
going back to the LA girl Pro concealer
and then I'm just going to take my booty
blender and just blend it all out
I'm just going to be taking the LA girl
Pro concealer and this is in the shade
arm and now I'm going to use this just
to like kind of bring some warmth back
to my face kind of like a cream contour
and I'm just going to pop it my
cheekbones and my jawline now I'm just
going to see how that blends out before
I do the rest of my face
so what we're working with that's cool
guys I'm just going to use my morphe g36
to blend this concealer hat you only
need a tiny little bit I'm just going to
blend that out to blend out so nicely
and for the price of this concealer it's
actually really good I love cream
contouring slash and bronzing my
forehead I feel like it's it just
completes the look so much oh my god my
hair needs to just itself off today
I'm just going to do a little bit of
concealer down the sides of my nose true
but with my nose I'm just going to blend
it out with my booty blender because
it's more precise then now moving on to
concealing my former Gama just squirt it
in my I am actually it's going to put on
the back of my hand and then apply it at
the brush because I'm sorry scared I'm
going to squirt it in my eye because it
 hurts so much
so I'm just going to apply this
concealer with a brush instead I like
that and then I'm just going to take my
Beauty Blender and just go to town this
concealer doesn't tend to crease quickly
either which I really like this is no
like big rush to get into baking
straightaway and I like that now to bake
my under eyes I'm going to be using DRI
translucent powder in the shade light
I'm just going to double check that
there is no lines underneath my eyes
before we set this yes so I'm
taking my damp Beauty Blender and just
go straight and I kind of like to put
powder on my nose like on the side of it
first sometimes because if you have
Beauty Blender hits that concealer when
you're setting it will take it off as no
if that happens to anyone else what it
happens to me now to set all the rest of
my foundation I'm just going to be
taking D Milani powder foundation in the
shade Shell and I'm just going to Pat
this powder in don't swell because
you'll move you might move foundation
that's sitting underneath it and that
just ruins all your hard work the edge
it with the sound a
blending now we are going to leave that
under I baked there select until I've
done underneath my eyes to let
everything sink in and settle in in the
meantime we're going to finish
underneath my eyes I'm just going to
zoom you guys are back in so we can
finish this alright so I'm pretty much
is going to do exactly what I did on top
of my eyes but underneath my eyes - the
wing and the globe so I'm going to take
that first transitioning sort of shade
that I use and I'm just going to be
putting this straight underneath right
up against my lashline and then smoking
it down and now I'm just going to smog
this down but I'm going to go in with
that the darker brown shade the warm
tone and just pretty much exactly the
same thing it's all about kind of like
that ombre effect would you just build
it up and then blending that up too and
then I'm just going to take a bit of the
black shade and put that right up
against my lashline and smoke it down
now I'm going to take some of that
Inglot gel liner again I'm going to put
it right on my waterline all the way to
make it a corner
then we're going to take the black
eyeshadow from the morphe palette and
just smoke that liner down a little bit
now let's get my eyes done to my mascara
I'm just going to be popping on a little
bit of benefits roller lash now for my
lashes I'm going to be taking these
social eyes lashes and these are in the
style called flutter
stick a damn okay so I'm sixties baby's
on so I'm just going to apply a little
bit of the house of lashes black eyelash
glue on the back of this eyelash I kind
of like this lash how it kind of just
goes from nothing to something see how
kind of like cat eyes out from like
short to long it's like it looks really
cool I'm just going to put a little bit
of mascara over that just to blend them
together I'm just gonna stick the other
lash line and then we'll get started on
my face yes okay now moving on to my
face I'm just going to be taking the
whole lot and now the brushes I'm using
you can buy on Shoko these are the
Jessup brushes so I'm just going to dig
into a bit of whole eye and then I'm
just going to start contouring and
chiseling out my face yes this is such a
good brush for contouring yes please to
excuse my hair as I said earlier I have
no idea what the hell it's doing or what
is going on with it can't forget to do
the jawline now for my blush I'm just
going to be taking this shake yeah for
me la girl bro-bro
Pro blush palette and I'm just going to
pop that on my cheekbones and blend it
back just for a little bit more College
the cheeks you know next I'm just going
to take the Mac six-plus again and just
spritz my whole entire face so I can
prep for my highlighter now apparently
in my last video I use this huda beauty
of highlighter palette wrong so I'm
going to be trying again so number one
is to apply Capri which is the darker
shade
okay now says I've got to apply
Santorini which is the white shade oh
yeah now just apply it as orys under the
cheek brace to add dimension and shape
then click on a bit over the top here
with the highlight over that's fine and
now sweep I these are on the apples of
your cheeks or a healthy glow this looks
so much better than when it did when I
used it the first time today didn't know
how to use it the second time okay now
for my lips I'm going to be using the
Lillie Mae MAC lipstick in the shade
noting nude and these are sold
exclusively on stroke accom
and now dust to lock everything in place
I'm going to be taking Theodore I
cosmetic say all day setting spray and
this is in green tea / ginger I love to
stuff so much I don't know if in my eyes
for like 10 seconds because this does
have alcohol in it it's its main
ingredient hence why it works so well
because alcohol makes everything stay on
your face so yeah anyway guys this is
the end of today's video I really hope
you guys enjoyed it I sure did have a
fun time doing it because I'm obsessed
with this whole entire look just
remember all links and information to do
