today I thought I'd sit down and do like
a chit chat get ready with me I'm going
out for lunch to a cafe mmm and I want
to look like semi-decent cuz I'm Gordon
I just feel like doing my makeup yeah
just get ready with me I've got quite a
few products that I want to try out so
it's gonna be like first impressions as
well of me trying some new products so
mm-hmm and if you're wondering why my
foreheads like really patch is gonna had
a logic reaction to a skincare product
that I used for the first time last
night so that's looking a little bit
dodge but I'm please just ignore that so
if there might be alum today I'm just
going to be using the precisely my brow
pencil from benefits new range this is
so good so I've been growing my eyebrows
out lately and a lot of you have been
asking for a brow routine like a full
brow routine like want to do my full
glam it's coming okay it's coming I was
waiting for my brows to grow out a
little bit more so when it comes to my
eyebrows literally all I do is I fill
them in with this pencil and then I just
set them with like a brow setting thing
so they don't fly away during the whole
day you know okay so when I go out for
lunch like I mean literally anything
every single time I do my makeup I
always want to have like full coverage I
want to be like glam and I want to have
latches on to so this is like a casual
day out but it's like full glam sort of
things so if you're not used to that get
used to it because it's going to happen
right now for primer today I'm going to
be using benefit professional because it
is my all-time favorite as you guys know
that if you've been following me for a
while you would know professional is my
all-time favorite of goth for you guys
um are you right very back there so I
just bought a UH vlogging camera so you
guys will be seeing more vlogs from me
now like vlogs in general I have an
adventure donor next Tuesday in
Melbourne so I'll be vlogging that it's
a red carpet movie premiere so it should
be really exciting and this video will
be up on Monday I think so I'll be going
to the movie premiere tomorrow so make
sure if you want to add me on snapchat
add me now um so you can see what that's
all about
for my foundation today I'm going to be
using honey beige by a blonde this is my
favorite liquid foundation ever and I
just got raised stops I've literally
like every single color cuz I you from
my class
because they're amazing so got this for
me too so we got some honey beige I've
been here why is that liquidy what's
happened they better not change the
formula of this if they change the
formula my favorite foundation or
is going to hit the pan or good
coverage I literally am obsessed with
this foundation a lot of people like to
scrutinize iPad because it's like our
bond it's like marketed like Avon and
unique and self but to be honest you've
got to try it for your judger so a lot
of people have a go at me on instagram
for having a really yellow based
foundation I like yellow based
foundations
okay no one has any right to have a go
at me for wearing a foundation color
that I like what's wrong with a yellow
based foundation like I'd rather be
yellow than pink plus once you're
bronzed and concealed everything kind of
corrects itself anyway and it ends up
look as long as you make it look good in
the end and not stupid that I don't see
what the problem is like if you blend
everything out I don't see what the
problem is
oh look at this like allergic reaction
spot here see later go bad I don't want
to say what product I use because it's a
really well known product and I actually
got sent it as a PR package so I don't
want to like slam them because they gave
it to me for free so um but yeah it's
just not for me I think my skin is just
too sensitive for that one product now
I'm just going to take my jab you bend
it a little bit more on the back of my
hand and I'm just going to blend this
all out now I've got all these rips in
my Beauty Blender and you
know what I think it's from pulling with
my nails like I put holes in them
because they're so sharp with my nails
what do we all think about the marina
joyce situation it scares me it
literally gives me chills like i know
like the media and people can persuade
you to think things that aren't true but
honestly if you look back at her videos
from months ago and now you look at the
new videos something's wrong and I don't
want to go like pointing fingers saying
she's on drugs or anything because she
could had something wrong with her and
just doesn't want to admit to it which
is totally understandable because she
could be embarrassed like you just don't
know what happens behind the scenes do
you just you're just literally a donor
for my concealer today I'm going to be
using the Maybelline fit me concealer
and the shade
ten lights I wish they made a lighter
color than this because this is just a
bit too dark because I really like that
beaming under-eye highlight there is a
powder that I really want to get called
nas snowy nikkietutorials always uses it
to set her under eyes and it just
interested me so much like I'm going to
go into nas and see if I can get it when
I'm in Melbourne next week I'm just
going to blend that out with my damp
Beauty Blender I was going to use my Mac
Studio um
Pro Longwear concealer stuff but I want
to use more drugstore products because I
know um
not everyone wants to go out and spend a
shitload of money on um expensive
high-end products so and plus drugstore
products are just good too like some of
them are really really good like you
know how everyone's obsessing over like
those wet and wild highlighters unlike
the sleek highlighter palette like the
la girl concealer Pro ones like some
drugstore products are really good you
know what sometimes I think that like
high-end brands are just a retail thing
so they can make more money like I don't
want to throw shade but honestly some of
them are really good if you wanna if you
want to go out clubbing ring of BYU's
foundation if that works for you then I
say do it girlfriend whatever works for
you you do it work with what you've got
that's what I think I think work with
what you've got um okay - babe right on
dries I am going to be baking because
well I mean you know I love a good bake
I'm going to be using the RCM a no
colour powder now I use this in my last
video I think in my tutorial and it is
better than Laura Mercier Laura Mercier
and go yourself so Laura if you're
watching this eat a dick because you
should this is so much better because
this doesn't set into the creases of
your under eyes like Laura does like I
packed my baked on right like I pack it
on so much Laura tends to crease my
exits to like set into the fine lines
this doesn't you need to get this I got
this off eBay it was so cheap can also
get it on like um I don't know beautybay
I don't know if they stopped it but
literally it's so finely milled it does
not set into your phone lines on your
eyes I'll leave the link down below on
the email link where I got this from
anyone who's interested I think it was
around 25
I have $30 I still love my airspun not
going to lie still love my s1 I've
actually run out of that um so I've
moved on to RC MA
so this RC MA a lot of you been asking
on like my Instagram my Twitter like
what's the difference between the RMA
and the s-1 powder okay so let me tell
you the s-1 powder it comes in like
translucent only so there's translucent
extra coverage there's like three
different shades so basically a
translucent powder has a warm tinge to
it so it tends to alter the color a
foundation a little bit but the ICMA has
three different powders as a translucent
one which alters the color a foundation
there's a banana one and then I'm pretty
sure this banana one and then there's
the no color one so the no color one is
one that doesn't alter your foundation
color and it gives you I know people
will ask this does not give you any
flashback whatsoever which is awesome
because it's such a wide it's like a
cocaine white powder and a lot of them
can give you flashback but this doesn't
give you flashback and it's so cheap and
it's better than Laurie mess the air
 oh no I said the rest of my face
I'm going to be using the Australis
fresh and flawless pressed powder in
deep natural I love this powder I mean
it's one of those like cliche Kings for
every youtuber but not every youtuber
but a lot of youtubers like makeup
beauty gurus are obsessed with because
they call it a dupe for the mac studio
fix powder foundation which I've never
tried but honestly this does a really
good job so it wouldn't surprise me if
it does the same or better and it's so
cheap as well especially when price
point has a sell on it something like
six dollars so for my eyes today I'm
going to be using the under starred
Modern Renaissance so the first color
I'm gonna dip into in the palette is
burnt orange just one just here now
let's just talk about this brush for a
second this is from it's all about
makeup in Melbourne they have a story
Mooney Ponce's to their own brand brush
it is literally so good me and my friend
Alex are obsessed with these like
they're literally so good like Mac who
like Mac who these like these look
really good and I'm gonna drag that up
through this area here
now I'm going to go into this color here
this is called realgar this is like a
really like harsh orange color it's
gonna be putting this all over my entire
eyelid because I love like this orangey
like tone so pretty it makes my eyes
look so blue if you have blue or green
eyes if you use orange your eyes will
pop like orangey like warm brown colors
your eyes will pop so severely it's
gonna be better than a strong
highlight now it's going to grab my
blending brush that I did with the first
color and I'm just gonna blend around
those edges just going back in to burn
orange I'm just going to give that
under-eye area just a little bit of love
because you know it means that sorry
it's so hard to talk when I'm doing my
eyeshadow my lips on my eyebrows when I
do my face is so much easy to talk and
my talk about random for my mascara
today I'm gonna be using the Mac
extended play gigablack lash mascara oh
oh oh my god seriously putting a scar on
is one of the worst things
now the lashes that I'm using today are
from a brand called blend of lashes I'm
not sure what style they are but they're
kind of short
I'll leave the name of them down below
if you're interested so I'm just gonna
use my house of lashes black lash glue
and just put a little bit on to that
strip there let that dry for a little
bit I can't wait to do my face I just
wanna get my bronzer and everything like
on now that my lashes are on I'm just
gonna dust away this bake it now I
actually got set this compact from Javan
Shu and it's just like a prism look it's
like a it's like a highlighter it's like
an under-eye highlighter I'm pretty sure
so it's got like different tones on it
on the compact there's like for like a
pink a brown a light skin tone and then
a dark skin tone so I'm just going to
switch my Brown in the hole swish my
Brown it's going to switch my brush
around in the hole compact and I'm just
gonna what smells really rich like you
know when you get a high-end product and
it smells really rich oh that's not so
good oh my god my ears are popping you
know when you're getting over a cold and
it's like oh that hurts
ah that's what's happening right now
stop go away four microns or today I'm
going to be using it's all about makeup
Fiji problems I love these guys as I
earlier in the video about their brushes
and PS that was not sponsored I just
generally liked them they're actually my
friends so yeah and there's a bit of
eyelash chilling in here I'll have fun
in typical me so I'm just going to
bronze my whole face if I'm not gonna
like like worry about this all that much
just just like warmed up the face like
you know how earlier I was talking about
like it's okay if you wear different
like undertone foundation as long as you
make it work this is what I'm talking
about
I should mention I'm actually going to
Brisbane next week to see shiny again
and I'll be there for a week because
like there's so much to do in so little
time so we have so much time to do cool
fundings and I'm going to vlog I didn't
vlog last time I was there but I'm going
to vlog this time because just we get up
to the most random so yeah we have
an event to go through which should we
call as well can't wait to see bindi and
Luna again oh my god Lauren are stop it
bindi cubby now I have this like really
strong connection with all dogs that I
meet lately and it's just starting to
really mentally affect me because I feel
like I actually need to buy a dog now
now me use my uh Nastasia contour kit
should just chisel my face out a little
bit like I'm not all that fast of how
non cheerful that looks as long as I cut
this jawline okay good I'm gonna cut
this chin as well I want to create like
a bit of a new chin I love creating like
one chin on my body it's so much fun if
you follow me on Instagram I would just
like to say a huge thank you I hit 100k
the other morning I woke up and I was
like that is amazing that is a hundred
thousand people who are interested in my
boring life like if you put a hundred
thousand people in a room that is a lot
like even a thousand even a hundred even
fifty people is a lot that is amazing so
I just want to say thank you and I will
be doing an Instagram giveaway very very
soon what I want to do is I wanna join
Instagram give away all my favorite
products so I want to go out and buy all
my Holy Grail products and put them into
a giveaway because I want someone to
experience all my favourite products if
that makes sense I don't know whether to
do one class or two players I think I
might just do one but I feel bad like I
just want everyone to win hopefully I
can be like Alan one day and just give
everyone something okay so for my
highlighter today I'm going to be using
this Gerard cosmetics highlight
in this color Bridget Bridget Britt
Britt Britt Oh Bridget brick it I don't
know oh yeah that's nice it's like a
nice hey you know what this reminds me
of Mac soft and gentle it's like not too
intense but I guess you can build it up
can you see that so it's not actually
extreme strong about highlight which is
kind of what I'm loving at the moment
let's go with that for my blush today
I'm going to be using a Milani baked
blush in Luminoso this is one of my new
favorite blushes I finally worth the
hype this is not overrated in my opinion
that's the color of it it's like a
peachy tone and I love it because it's
also very buildable and it's got a bit
of a gleam to it as well which is kind
of what I like in a blush sometimes and
for my lip color today I'm going to be
using jeffree star mannequin I really
love this love this
now just to spice it up a little bit I'm
going to be using this lip liner from
it's all about makeup they also sent me
this as well so thank you Danny and
Chris that is so nice of you this is in
the color Lady Godiva just like a
darkish sort of nude color so I'm just
going to go around the edge you'll line
my lips with this and kind of blend it
in a little bit this actually looks so
good I love this combo it's my new fave
calm cool now to set everything place
I'm just going to be using the dry
cosmetics slate or day setting spray and
this is a lavender this is so
strong and apparently you need to close
your eyes like you generally do it all
setting sprays but you need to keep them
close until it's all gone because this
has got an alcohol in it which is quite
strong and can sting your eyes so I
probably wouldn't be using this on
clients if that makes sense so it's
going to close
oh my god it is so strong of lavender
and I'm also just going to be taking two
squirts of fix+
on my cheeks just to make them pop a
little bit more I feel so glowy and nice
I love this makeup oh my god so if you
