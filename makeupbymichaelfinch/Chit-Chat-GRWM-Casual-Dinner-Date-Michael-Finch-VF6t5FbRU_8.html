as you can see I'm back home I have oh I
have a new background a wide sparkly
background I'm hoping to get some better
lighting so there's no shadow steering
but this is what I've got this is what
I'm going to work with for the time
being so tonight I'm going to be going
at 50 knots or I may as well do my
makeup on camera catch up a little bit
even though chitchat like a week ago
about a week ago week ago I'm going to
do another one so let's get straight
into it the first product I'm going to
be using today is a moisturizer I called
wonder lash and sir collaboration with
kim tae and it is like a Primark slash
moisturizer meant to be really pretty
um pre meaning like smooth and stuff so
I'm just marking for this one with my
hand a little trick if you always have
acrylics on you just dip your knuckle
into the pot and just scrape it out and
then it saves you having to get all
under your fingernails and just like
losing hearts of product and then having
to wash it all the way so I'll never
wash them into youth so obviously with
me being me I'm going to carry on one of
the lush is also such a great name for
like a moisturize like wonder lash
wonder lush wonder lush moisturizer but
can also be used as a primer and that's
what I'm going to do to check okay so
once I put all run in it does dry a
little bit and go Chucky which is good
because it's a great base for our
foundation even though we're not sliding
off the foundation I never prime my face
guys don't know why I just did that
it was being right in front of me
halfway just did that okay so my eyes
today I'm going to be using the whole
extr Taylor London eyeshadow tell it so
some absolutely stunning colors in here
and I'm keen to dig into them so what
I'm going to do is just apply some
sticky K to the corners of my eyes and I
should not have apply primer before to
linger through it which is going to
bounce all the not zero so on your wish
me luck okay they're pretty much stuck
on soon as you guys in so we can get
started on the eyes there we are not
employed sorry
so far behind understand take a bit of
deal on this way concealer and just
apply that across my lid
in our space my shadows and then I'm
just going to be blending that in with
my Real Techniques sponge now I'm going
to take a little bit of my awesome a
powder and just set that concealer so it
does not move okay now giving into the
Chloe xcr t-shirt palette so first of
all I'm going to go into the color here
called unconditional which is this
transition sort of looking color and
also hit on my blending brush I'm just
going to put that for the crease and it
blended off yeah it's a blending
mcbutter I like this I like it
so how was everyone's 2017 treating them
so far I had the best saw to 2017 I was
in Brisbane for like three weeks
I agree that I slapped like I literally
need to go there and just move I've been
looking at so many apartments and have
some really nice one but I like my
really hurt I get them apparently when
you go to get apartments and stuff when
you have a job like this it's not the
easiest thing to do so I'm kind of
stressed about that but I'll get there
I'll get there I'll get one I just want
to be up high I want to be up high and
like an apartment than no one's really
lifting yes I can work to be glad of new
you like modern gold gold gold and I can
do like a morning routine like a half to
our apartment or whatever it's called
I'm just looking for that because I'm
looking to do my morning routine in this
room oh I mean right now I'm currently
living with my parents
if you guys don't know I'm only only 20
hotwire 40 in a game and so yeah I'm
living here with my parents so yeah one
of you gotta be a lot easier to do
things okay moving on I'm going to take
the color gr called on the fire and I'm
going to put this for the crease once
again just finding that so that you can
just plug these eyeshadows on and worry
about blending after that fellow luxury
they are and then I'm going to go back
to my blending
and unconditional again and learn not
for learners to to get off okay now
going into the color careful queen dance
like a dark sort of like cool trained
Brown I'm just going to put that it
might out of be also putting it through
this time of my crease as well just
because I do high school it eyes it's
good to bring the color all the way
across just so you can see when your eye
is open as well I feel like a Trekkie
eyes if you bring the color across when
you have hooded eyes rather than keeping
it closed it brightens it up a little
bit
now just taking the shade in the corner
here called dainty I'm sorry taking that
and under my brow bone sure highlight
and accentuate my brow bone we really
need to get my eyebrows done now so
Harry I can put a little bit of dainty
on making a corner as well but we will
touch that up for later as well now
moving on to my eyelid I'm going to be
taking the colour-pop cream pigment
eyeshadows super shock shadow and ever
know what to call these things in the
shade a boy band is like a burgundy
color and I need a glass hot
brush that does not have concealer
anybody else have that problem finance
laptop rush without concealer on it yeah
welcome to my line so I am just going to
spray a little bit of six o'clock on my
brush my favorite thing ever a little
bit meaning a lot so as you can see boy
bander is nothing too fancy just kind of
like a pigment to go on the lid with a
little bit of shimmer in it okay now
moving back onto the face I'm just gonna
spritz it with some Mac prep and vs6 bus
big plus now before I do move on to the
face I just finished my eyes so I will
just go back in my bag there we go so my
mascara I'm just going to be using the
Urban Decay perversion mascara and
applying a generous amount plus that to
my top lashes will be doing the bottoms
of the later now for my lashes I'm going
to be using huda beauty Samantha in the
number seven I'm just going to put these
on off-camera and I'll be right back
hang out of my lashes around it let's do
a sound ation Ghibellines fifteen
finders today guys I don't know why I'm
really sorry
hopefully people don't get angry sorry
for foundation I'm going to be using the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation
and this is in the shade flat point five
start operating primes before the day of
wonder lash primer so I am just going to
go straight in with my foundation so I'm
going to be pumping a little bit of that
out onto the back of my hand and then
just going in with my brush and then
start applying this is a bit lighter
than I thought it would be with my tan I
do have a channel at the moment and it's
a bit a lot of hurt yet Oxford arms a
little bit
or I'll have to fix it with powder
either way I'm not bust and while this
foundation smells really like good like
refreshing
rather than being a makeup smelling
foundation that actually smell really
quite refreshing this is my first time
really using this because this is one of
those foundations are actually looks
like skin like a diamond look hmm
makeup the economic okay maybe it's just
me being an idiot but I wish this
foundation was a little bit more higher
coverage I feel like a light to medium
coverage it was a little bit more full I
feel like I'd be in love with this it
feels really good on the skin as well
because someone who I apply foundation
it feels like like you can feel a
feeling cakey do not I mean it is
literally just like I've got nothing on
like this is the self must ever said
that with a foundation is difficult got
nothing on now true conceal and
highlight my face I'm just going to
going back to my fortify concealer and
you guys know I like to do my chin
Cupid's bow my nose and a little bit on
my forehead and then I like to blend
that out first before joint underneath
my eyes so it's on the crease and go
gross so I'm gonna take my sponge and
blend that cup sugar my favorite one is
I'm wearing is top chat type I know you
guys probably sick of hearing that but
it is good okay
then I'm just going to blend that all
out those intensive
enjoy hey I feel like this is very
different to learn or they do it
suffocating different it's good now I'm
going to be taking my trusty Ostia main
or helipad and just dipping my beauty
blender on to that tipping it upside
down this is a good way to do if you
don't wanna lose product and then we
always help the product anyway and then
either skirt is striking underneath 10
spank the out of my under eyes I'm
putting quite a bit of powder on shavers
I feel like it's not bright enough and
this will help brighten my hunger a
little bit now to stick a little bit of
that in through this folder here and I'm
just going to run right over the rest of
my face okay there finishing off
underneath my eyes I'm not going to
check unconditional which was the first
call that I used at start and sort of
put that underneath my eye and then a
little bit of on fire which was the
second call that I used and then a
little bit of queen bee which was the
color I used two days and microwave now
I'm just going to go straight in and
dust off my under-eye bag we do not mean
but or any more north north north yeah
so my bronzer I'm just going to be using
the hot makeup professional matte
bronzer to bundle my thing and just go
straight in straight off but after I put
so much on this stuff is very pigmented
not about thing though because it blends
out or I set it on a default edge
Sarah not very talkative today guys I
just got a lot on my mind a lot in my
brain or what's going on
not bad stop good start but just my
brains going in a million miles per US
or not it's hypo as I normally end so
I'm just going to be cleaned up runs are
all down my Chin's just so they all
blend together and it matches my tan and
a little bit over your ears as well you
don't think here sticking out like I
always do I hope going over my tears of
foundation it makes me cringe like
liquid foundation job have foundations
right but when you have to go over yet
jax-ur by so I'm going to take that on
it just wash out with my new favorite
brush for contouring weird I know it but
don't know why I'm just going to kind of
go in a little bit not too harsh like I
always do just like low-key conjure kind
underneath my jaw into and I'm my bottom
lip to give him here a big lip not that
I need it now I'm going take a bit more
thick slice and just spray that all over
my face and now taking my highlight
brush and my earth bra Rodeo Drive
highlighter and it's been up around the
top of my neck brow ever so slightly not
too much and some on this side so it's
my lips today I'm going to be using a
combo or whichever shop mannequin and
chickasaw my music I guess this search
actually I always take it to the club's
when I lose them so I keep buying them
and now should take a little bit of I'm
nude and that's it let that dry and then
we are all done just a lot all of that
in place and let them take my adrak of
mix light all day this is the green tea
/ ginger and while a little bit more
fix+ on my cheeks to make Mahalo pop a
little bit more slow this is everything
