I'm so happy to be filming again I'm
back at home as you can see I've
actually bought a whole new setup I've
got new lighting I've got a new land and
I've got a new microphone so you might
hear something a little bit different in
a good way which is stunning I've got
these new lights I actually bought an a
portable air conditioner for my room
because these lapses are hot so the air
comes on fan mode at the moment so you
shouldn't be able to hear it
with this new microphone I've already
tested it all out so everything should
be awesome and I'm so happy because I
just want to give you guys top quality
content that's all I want to do like you
guys put food on the plates I mean not
literally obviously but you like you
know what I mean
and I'm just overall so happy about
everything my new setup I also bought a
new computer as well so I can play
around with Final Cut Pro a lot more
because I actually did have the illegal
version but I just bought it then so I
can get like new text and like all that
sort of stuff so I'm so so so excited
and yeah I'm just really happy okay so
today I'm just going to be doing my
makeup I'm going to a friend's going
away drinks at their house tonight so so
I thought I might as well just a
challenge in my makeup and shout you
guys this is my first youtube video with
all my new so I'm really excited to
see how everything's going to go
starting off with my eye base I'm going
to be using the touch ID tape concealer
just under my eyebrows and she uses an
eye base today and I splashed and forgot
to wet my Beauty Blender and I'm not
getting up so big plus
that's why I go through so much
6 plus because of these little shits and
I can't be getting up and going
out there and go onto this thing but
whatever so this is the type check tape
in the shade light oh my god access
concealer is just amazing if you're new
welcome this is my best friend's but if
you've been around for a while you know
how obsessed I am with this Attell shout
out now because people are probably sick
and tired of me talking about this
 concealer so I'm just concealing
under my brows and popping this all over
my lid area and now I need to blend that
up with my Beauty Blender but of course
it's not wet so hmmm thank you just
going to drown the absolute out of
my Beauty Blender with 6 plus
I actually didn't have a water bottle in
here the other day I filled the video
yesterday but I lost the footage because
my memory card itself up the I
stinky so I bought a new memory card
also and that's still not wet enough

there we go or wet thinking so I'm just
going to blend that huh
now this is set my concealer in place so
it doesn't crease by the way you know
how I used like it used to be a rush to
drew my lids and then set it real quick
this concealer basically sets itself
like I still like to set it because you
know me but it basically sets itself and
it does not crease doesn't crease for me
some people are creases for them under
their eyes I think I was watching who
was it pretty sure is desi Perkins she
can't use the tape check concealer close
to her eye to decreases or it's quite
dry under there or something like that
but me I stick it right up basically I
put it in my eye so I'm just
going to take a little bit of a
translucent powder on here and just get
that onto my lid area I'm actually going
to try out some new translucent powders
and guys like you're getting sick of
seeing the same old things I actually
use my friends cut blondie locket powder
and it wasn't the greatest thing I've
ever used but it was it wasn't bad you
not I mean and I've actually been seeing
a lot of American youtubers talk about
the cover effects translucent powder so
I'm going to get my hands on that and
there will be a review coming soon in a
video like this I'm just trying to stay
updated with like all the makeup and
everything like that because I know that
a lot of new products coming out and
it's basically my job now to review
products try new products so I want to
really change it up and just get as much
makeup as I can just like and review it
for you guys and if you do have any
requests with makeup you want me to try
leave it down below it can when I stop
talking about that boring now let's
move on to the eye shadow for my eyes
today I am going to be using the xxx Pro
a shadow palette now I've used it four
times and I hated it so I did
try it in the video yesterday that I
lost and of course it works on camera
the first time it actually worked was on
camera when I actually didn't want it to
work but I think it's just me getting
used to this formula of eye shadow I'm
really picky when it comes to eyeshadows
it's that good we're good okay so the
first shade I'm going to be taking is
innocent here it's kind of like a
warmish transition choice shorter shades
almost Tribune on I mean I'm just going
to pop that through another guru
so what's been happening guys I just got
back from Brisbane we had Shaunie's 1
million subscriber surprise party she
had no idea actually did a blog on it if
you haven't seen it go check it out a
few videos back her reaction was
literally priceless she almost cried
like Loki she had a tear or two I think
but she was so happy and it was just the
best thing ever I can't wait to move to
that city because I'm actually obsessed
with it just everything about it is
amazing friends the place just the city
it's just I love the valley I love going
out in the valley it's just so much fun
I'm actually going to be dragging that
down quite a bit because I want it to be
like kind of full glam today and the
different to any other day to be honest
so the next shade I'm going to be taking
is called whimsy of this beautiful
orange kind of wanton shade I'm just
popping that on the out of the same
brush and kind of just blending that up
into that color that we just laid down
just before oh my god I can't believe I
haven't even touched on this yet thank
you so much for 300,000 subscribers you
guys have no idea how lucky and thankful
I am for every single one of you who
watch me honestly 300,000 is a huge 50
of a huge number for me especially like
on YouTube or something like that if I
was stuck on stuck on like I don't know
five thousand subscribers I'd be happy
lack this three hundred thousand is a
huge number like you put all those
people into one room wrong so I just
want to thank you guys so much I never
take you for granted I love each and
every single one of you who watch even
if you watch my videos and you don't
like me just like watching me because
you like to pick something out that you
don't like about me I don't care you're
still watching me you're still giving me
of you so thank you so much so the next
shade I'm going to be taking is this one
here called edgy now what I'm going to
do is I'm just going to plot that I make
out of ve but I've already done this
polymer and I'm just going to bring that
across my lash line then I'm just going
to dip into a little bit of pump which
is the jet black color there and I'm
also just going to pop that on my
out of the and kind of just bring it up
to this outer edge just here doesn't
have to be perfect because these shadows
do blend out very well so there's a bit
of smokiness going on on this top lash
line and just taking a little bit more
edgy and I'm just going to blend over
those edges of the black cool I've
nothing too extreme just something a
little bit cute you know what I mean now
I'm just going to be taking a little bit
of six-plus on my flat top brush just
spraying that and then I'm going to dip
into the shade called Sol Sol Sol sounds
like your hands it's going to dip into
that shade called you restrung and i'm
just going to plop that straight on top
of my lid oh that's a pretty color gold
is like my go-to gold and warm tone to
my go-to but I did a bit of cool tone
today because one change it up a little
bit you know what I mean like people are
going to get sequencing orange soon and
just get on subscribe see ya they are
going to take my blending brush to just
blend over the edges of that Goldy shade
just to make sure it's all seamless and
stunning for my winged liner today I'm
just going to be using the Tarte a
theist clay paint liner and I'm not
going to talk while I do this so it's a
little over the music rubber and speed
it up hard to talk when you do a
wing if you're a makeup artist or you
like doing wings you know exactly what
I'm talking about so we are be
okay now that my wings are all done
let's move on to mascara and lashes I'm
just going to take a clean makeup light
and just clean underneath my eyes now
for mascara today I'm going to be using
the Marc Jacobs velvet Noir
noir mascara I see Laura Lee talks about
this quite a lot so I actually want to
give it a girl I have not tried it yet
sorry keep the guy it's actually pretty
good
not as good as I thought it was going to
be it's very good for lengthening but I
feel like if you want to sickness you
should use the Too Faced better than sex
but this is still pretty good mama isn't
even want elephants obsessed with the
edge here in songs like hustle on the
hill and shades of you me hard
because they're amazing now the lashes
I'm using today actually the ones I use
in yesterday's video and I lost the
footage as I said earlier these are from
a brand called electroclash and they're
in the style heat
okay so glue these on today I'm just
gonna be using me house of lashes black
eyelash glue it's one of my favorite
lash please ever there we go so I should
stop down so different the lash can make
I'm just going to pop this one on and
then we'll get started on the base now
getting started on the face I'm just
going to technique mac's fix+
and just generously apply that to you in
my case for primer today I'm going to be
using the Marc Jacobs coconut invisible
undercover primer I've been wanting to
try this since it was like a thing on
YouTube but means that I kind of went
for the foundation the remarkable but I
never got to try this and it was
actually in stock on Sephora for a
change so why not mmm okay really quick
for my foundation I'm going to be using
the RCM a foundation color process
foundation a lot of that is I've never
tried it out so let's give it a shot so
I'm just going to take that on my
multi-info seven brush and
like a paddle brush and I'm just gonna
 get into that generously as fast
because you know I love my full coverage
and I'm just gonna start painting this
all over sorry from what I can tell so
far this foundation is actually pretty
good coverage I'm just going to blend
this out with my Beauty Blender and see
how it goes and I'm just gonna conceal
well I'm actually going to foundation
the top of my brows just so they're nice
and that defines it's very lightweight
this foundation and that's what I do
like about it also
so overall first impressions of this
foundation I really like it it's got
good coverage it's very it feels very
lightweight very buildable also which I
drew love now concealer today I'm going
to be using okay
so I'm just going to be putting that
down the center of my face and what this
is going to do why I put it here here
here and here instead of just having all
this like a brightness under your eyes
and kind of balances out the contrast
and all that in your face which is
stunning I like to do this middle
section first and then I'll go in under
my eyes and do that afterwards
okay well it's all blend it out and then
it's going to go straight in which I can
fill out underneath my eyes this is
going to brighten this is going to suck
up my under eyes and I'm so excited so I
like to go right up to the base my right
underneath my under eye I like to go
right up to the eye and then kind of
bring it out like that start on a little
bit around here - you can see a lot
literally there's a lasts a long now I'm
just taking my trusty RMA and no color
powder this is the worst like or
just the packaging sucks ass on this but
the product is so good I think I'm going
to see if I can find like an empty
translucent thing that I can put into it
cuz honestly I just wait so much every
single time I use it so I'm just going
to pack this right underneath my eye
with my damp a beauty by night and I'm
going to kind of press it into the skin
as I go
I'm also just going to bake my nose my
forehead my Cupid's bow just cuz I love
to I don't know why I do it I honestly
don't know why my nose does tend to get
quite well II from time to time I'm sad
you like to bake that because it does
doesn't prevent it completely but it
does you know
help hold off on the oil for quite some
time
now to set the rest of my face I'm just
going to take some more of that RCM a
translucent and I'm just going to dust
it over don't forget to get it all over
your shirt as well because
that's what I do every time and
give up waste film I always wear black
you know why I just do I just think like
if you wear too much color you have to
change it up every single time you do a
video so they look like the same video I
just did to hailed back okay that's
looking pretty modified and all set to
me which is stunning now to bronze my
face today I'm going to be using the
Marc Jacobs tantrik or mega bronzer guys
this is amazing this bronzer it blends
it's my new favorite forms are 100% it's
actually amazing like I'm I'm just I'm
obsessed with this one so much see how
like buildable it is and I'm just going
to bronze up around my forehead as well
because why not have that bronzing - now
if you bronze and contour around your
how to actually French your forehead in
so if you wanted to make it look a
little bit smaller I like to do that
because my forehead is literally a
fivehead
when people see me they're like you
must be smart like you can land an
airplane on there but no one day I will
get my hairline pulled down
that's why thing scares me because I
pull it all or like all hair down and
they poke holes and implant a hair oh
 that talk about some dry patches on
my skin I'm going to dust
off my undereyes date we don't need that
anymore well it's going to be doing a
little bit of shadow under the eye today
not too much
now blush do I have a blush one I can
use today for my brush I'm just going to
be using that Mel buff from Mac this is
the blush that goes with everything this
one and I think it's called peaches that
goes with every single look you do
because it's like not pink it's not like
a specific tone it just goes with
everything you know what I mean so I'm
going to think that on my staple for
your nipple brush and pop it on my
cheeky little squats
bring a bit of color back to my face
well we haven't even contoured yet
 red BS we should do that
hey just to contour my face a little bit
more it's going to be taking a benefits
hoola bronzer and I'm just going to go
into my cheekbones and just darken up
this
contour a little bit I guess just go
over where I've drawn and it's gonna
just cool it down a little bit so the
shades not as warm honestly I don't
really know how what I'm saying I'm just
saying what I'm thinking running a
little bit down the side of the nose it
to bring that back yeah we should just
quickly finish the under eyes off I'm
sorry I'm on my way
driving that nineteen out on those
country lanes just definition of the
under eyes I'm just going to take a
little bit of innocent and a little bit
of whimsy which is a true like orangey
transitional shade for you and I'm
literally just going to like put that
straight underneath I'm going to do any
dark shadows today I'm just going to put
this underneath and just like done then
I'm going to take a fluffy blending
brush and add some more innocent and I'm
gonna go straight underneath my eye and
just blend out there is colors yes
bindi that's exactly what I wanted
now before we highlight I just like to
split my face with a little bit of six
plus a little bit of six plus V all
right now for my highlighter today I'm
going to be taking just a train from
Joey Joey Joey Jenna how to say it I
bought some Joey products because I see
a lot of the massive youtubers talk
about them so I wanted to see if they're
actually good as people say they are so
let's give this highlight up a shot okay
that was like 1 1 2 3 5 done oh yeah
well this has definitely blown me away
can't forget to up your Cupid's bow
these are super pigmented and pretty
I've actually got three I also got topaz
and rose quartz I think it's called I'll
definitely be trying those in another
video but for today for today's look I
feel like this is absolutely perfect I'm
just gonna take some more of that
mascara and I'm just going to grow on my
bottom lashes with it
pretty girls a bottom lashes as well I
must say and now almost last but not
least I'm going to be using the UA
tarah lipcream so i actually want to
throw in my house for about four hours
the other day because I liked you
well because it speaks of why you come
into video to see if I like them or not
so I can tell you straight away whether
they're good or not I love this formula
so much it's more of a cream so it's not
like going to dry completely matte but
it's still going to have a moisturizer
it's still going to be moisturizing it
dries but it doesn't transfer but at the
same time it doesn't dry completely but
it still doesn't transfer does that make
any sense it's a really good
formula and I love this color it's
called Terra I think I just said that so
I'm just going to pop this on and they
smell so good too they kind of have a
really similar smell to Kylie cosmetics
the liquid lip kits now to set
everything in place I'm just going to be
using the Kat Von D a look at makeup
setting this this is a new one that I
got the other day
so I'll come back to you guys and if you
don't want you know how it goes you know
it's really hard to tell is makeup
setting spray to do work or not because
I sweat a little bit on my face so it's
kind of hard to tell for Lola watch and
learn
so this is a finished look I really hope
