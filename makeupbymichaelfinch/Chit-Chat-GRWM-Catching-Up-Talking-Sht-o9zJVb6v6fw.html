lot of you have been asking me to do a
lot more er chattier video so
that's what I'm going to be doing today
the reason why I sometimes I just like
to do simple tutorials is because I'm
not in the mood to talk and you have to
be in the mood and there's no point if
I'm not going to if that makes any sense
so I'm going to try always be in the
mood to talk to you guys and it has
a really great topics that I want to
cover this week so ah let's do it now as
for the whole makeup situation I don't
know what my face was going to project I
love on it at this point so whatever
happens happens don't know what it's
gonna be but it's gonna happen firstly
i'ma go in with is this benefit
Porefessional and that rescue
now real talk no one cares about the
product so let's get into some Oh gossip
who wants to start off by talking about
Justin and Orlando's news can we just
take a moment basically if you're not in
the loop or if you're underage you
shouldn't be listening to this story
skipping like a minute or something um
basically a land of bloom when is it
called canoodling where is that off Mean
Girls the pad will call canoodling
basically a Len Jo was in a beach with a
DES beach with Katy Perry when you sneak
out just a me bar because they both
hated each other but I do the same thing
yeah I don't know if Justin's a real or
fake at this moment in time I have a
rough idea that they're real but
something's telling me the death fake
the same news website that published
Orlando's published Justin's to money
yeah those photos literally made my week
I mean Justin you need a like do
something about that down there because
there's something going on this it looks
like there's a bit of grey hair or
something so you need to get that anyway
for my foundation today I'm going to be
using the l'oreal infallible 24-hour
maps now I cleaned up my makeup brushes
the other day if you're a makeup artist
and you do freelancing as well you
always always always clean your
freelancing brushes but when it comes to
doing your own it's like
really cannot be farmers anyway I would
just get some of that God idea what else
can we talk about ah okay so I went to
this movie premiere for up verb and it
was gorge can we just talk about shitty
 taxi drivers I mean real talk
why the does some taxi drivers
think you're so dumb like why do they
always go to long roots every single
time um so when the taxi on the way
there and it was like 30 bucks yeah
whatever but I was going to use uber but
I was locked out in my I was locked out
of my PayPal and on the way there to the
same event it was $30 I went back it was
11 you know why because I said to the
taxi driver Mike yet or any cost us by
12 bucks to get here so he went the
normal way like why do they do that why
do they always go the back way is like
unless you tell them unless you know the
area then you're going to be paying a
lot more than you should be because
 arseholes and they're so nice -
why do they why do all the nice ones do
it I'm just going to blend this
foundation ups with a really
dirty beauty mother now let's do you
feel I really don't know what concealer
I want actually use today let's do
Maybelline fit me now one thing I do
want to say that this is in my last
video I said I wished I had a lighter
shade of this and everyone was
commenting number 15 is a lighter shade
I do have number 15 I just don't know
where it is and I did know that it was a
lot of shade but it goes backwards like
1015 like it just doesn't make sense
that's why I said it
but I'm thank you to everyone who was
alerting me I'm very we're but um yeah
just what I've done in there do a little
bit of concealer you know it's a little
bit of summer summer Oh am I the only
one who's so confused with
instagrams new update apparently a
snapchat or Instagram or something
that's why it's all up like who
the I don't even look at the
stories on there like I just stick to
snapchat that up because the first day
that it happened I went through all the
stories and everyone's story was just
like following me on snapchat for me
okay so what the once the grainy
Instagram to post a story like
my first and the other day that she
feels like Instagram is more for like
professional for you know um photos not
 ones
and up in the morning would like all
your makeup off and like yeah I don't
know penzal we use Instagram for I guess
oh my god another thing we can talk
about is Kylie Jenner's birthday
surprise what do we all think of that
Real Talk
it's sold out within like a minute
surprise surprise Kylie Jenner surprised
 surprise it just like astounds
me that someone was such high demand of
products only makes like 500,000 or a
million like that is not enough Kylie
Jenner just you don't understand that
that is not enough I wish we could tell
like how much they actually put it up
because I remember the first time she um
give her lip kits I saw that real quick
in record timing but like we don't
actually don't have any they put out so
they could have only put out 200 and I
sold out in record time is like who
knows so she baked on my under eyes I'm
gonna be using a skier Maine no color
yes anyone who actually got their hands
on the birthday collection by Kylie
Jenner can you leave a comment down
below cuz I thought about what you got
no I have been struggling with getting a
good highlight a lot lately and you know
why because I used to bake all the way
up here when I went to put my Hollow I
wasn't showing cause too much powder on
it it just kind of like flew off and
went cakey so now I'm no longer going to
be baking past this point here because I
really want my highlight to work because
last week I felt like giving up on all
my heart isn't destroying them in the
bin and thinking what's the
point of even having them if they're not
going to work for me so I'm so glad I
got that worked out I set the rest of my
face I'm just going to be using the
Australis fresh and flawless deep
natural sorry if you live in Australia
have any of you seen the wedding movie
with Zac Efron and alladhina oh my god I
literally love it so much probably suck
your friends like shut listen up real
talk but um it is such a good movie and
so is I really enjoyed up fat the other
day like I didn't think I was going to
like it but I really did enjoy it which
I'm really happy about to bronze I'm
just using that it's all about makeup
fission bronzer this is like kind of
like a non orange bronzer for my pale
days is what I love using as if I was
cheese give me something right now I'd
be so
that does nothing wrong with that either
a lot of people have been asking me to
do that 100 layers challenge like
foundation stuff hundred days of
foundation behind that's literally me
every day so I don't know what's going
to change that at all
I mean I could come out with something
but literally every single one hundred
layers or something has been done I'm
not joking 100 days of condoms even Cory
de Soto just did that like on a cucumber
um like it's getting a hundred lines of
Indies I saw the other day I honestly
just shook my head and went what the
 like are you serious like it's
funny but like what else can possibly be
done 100 days of shirts underwear
temporary tattoos even mascara eyelashes
like everything's being done Hutton's
like actually if you guys want to see me
do the full face kids makeup challenge
let the comment down below so I know
that you want to see that because I'm
kind of King to do a but at the same
time I'm like worried is it still even a
scene where is it too late to do it real
talk now let's do a little bit of blush
up in here let's take a denies orgasm at
all someone commented on my video a few
videos back and said I love your videos
but every single time you say ayo I
stopped watching
I mean why like oh sorry about it for my
eyes today I'm gonna be dipping into
that other stuff they are Beverly Hills
Modern Renaissance palette i relaunching
is the makeup books announced all Wesley
Benjamin Carter I think that's his name
do it DeAndre Ali his video a link down
below just like orange eyeshadow white
liner and blue lips I think and I was
like oh my god I really wanna do that
look so much fun yeah so yeah I'm just
going to go into the shade called burnt
orange on this palette here a lot of you
have been asking what is this red dot
under my eyebrow yeah I'm not sure I'm
pretty sure it's a scar or like a
blemish I don't actually know I should
go on off my dad but I don't know what
it is but I just keeps getting bigger
over time I feel like if this keeps
getting bigger and bigger now we're
going to go be going into the shade
called realgar this is just like a like
a really burnt or edgy sort of color and
I'm just going to pack this all over my
lid
for real talk though I'm seriously over
girls who have a boyfriend and then
they're cheating on them
I mean why why not just break up with
them and just tell them I don't want to
be with you anymore rather than you know
keep it a secret like I'm no expert with
relationships but real talk when it's
happening to one of your friends just
 come out and say something
because I'm over
 seeing my friends get hurt from
people who just don't give a about
anybody else's feelings but their own
eat a dick and I just gonna run a bit
more of the orange under my eye oh my
gosh so I went to the pokies last night
if you don't know what the Pope so I
went to the pokies last night the
practice is basically just like little
machines we can like win money and stuff
they keep what money and you come out
with money I never ever go on them just
saying like I don't people to think I'm
some sort of like gambler or whatever
it's called but um it was stunning I
went in there and I put 20 25 25 dollars
in twenty dollars in and I came out with
110 but and that's when you stop that's
when you stop you don't you know you
don't keep going I like it like it was
hard to like I don't want to I want to
put more in but like that's when you
start having problems with gambling and
that's what you don't want to do so I
just like to say that I'm not
encouraging that it's just something
that I went in and did with a group of
friends just because we felt like it I
don't have a gambling problem just fine
point that out there okay cool now I
 the white liner let's do
breakfast at tiffany's by Geoffrey star
and I'm going to be using just to do my
wing today I don't know what
brush I'm going to use if there's any
clean brushes here let's do breakfast at
tiffany's I feel like this really goes
with my shirt very cool so this actually
works out so pretty I love this so much
this lipstick honestly smells so good
I was like a peppermint tea like root
beer but we'll go on I don't know it but
it smells really good a lot of people
don't like it but I love it okay so now
that we have that some greenish little
lighter on let's go into some mascara
it's so hard to talk when you're doing
your own makeup like just doesn't really
work out for me okay now for my bottom
mascara I'm going to use a Mac extended
play gigablack lash now I have kind of
figured it out in a way that the RCM a
powder can leave a tiny bit of a white
cast
under your eyes it really just depends
on how much you put on I guess like some
people might think that stuff to
whack-ass I don't think it has but for
some people it might look like there is
something going on under there this is
literally the most random makeup that
I've ever decided to do like I literally
don't even know what I'm doing it's just
kind of happening so I posted this thing
awhile ago on my Instagram saying about
the Kardashians and coming to see you
guys in August
I don't know dates when I'm pretty sure
Kourtney Kim and Chloe are all going to
be doing an appearance in Melbourne and
the Chadstone for their makeup line
creamer beauty or Kardashian beauty I
don't know what it was called in one of
those yeah they're gonna be doing one so
I'm keep your eyes peeled for that if
you want to meet them seriously I hate
waiting for lash glue to dry real tall
come on come on come on I'm pretty sure
that lashes stuck down okay it's
probably not the best stuff that I've
ever done
you can't even if I can see the
breakfast at tiffany's anymore let's do
the rest of the face let's get the
done sorry I was going to be taking a
little bit of fix+ just all over my face
mmm honestly even if you're not a makeup
where I buy some mac fix+ and sprayed on
your face it's literally the most
amazing smell feeling ever
I'm in love I love it yeah time for
highlighter let's use a Becca champagne
pot I did actually buy the other day the
Make Up For Ever HD foundation but it's
very dark and I can only use it when I'm
10 so I will be using that in a video
very very soon and you'll be hearing my
first impressions about that see it
works when I Drive Bay
you know my favorite highlighter as of
late actually but I've been using it
like my party videos is the dry
cosmetics in Bridget it is so
stunning like it's my new favorite color
I'm just gonna put a little bit on cuz
one on it just looks so so nice I'm just
gonna dig back into a bit more champagne
pop a little bit on that Cupid's bow now
I don't know how my liquid lipstick is
gonna go because I did get my lips done
again the other day I don't know if
they're like going to be dry or anything
they look pretty good to me sorry
just go ahead and do it so for my lip
color I'm gonna be using jawbreaker by
Jeffrey star I'm still excited to do
blue lip so I'm just gonna like dig into
this oh off I'm obsessed I haven't
used this in so long
Oh strawberry being silly I'm obsessed
now debating whether I should put a
little bit of drug lord in the middle
just to get that a bit of an ombre
effects happening which is what I might
do
lllll I'm gonna take a clean blending
brush to blend this out actually not my
finger oh my god I'm living now I'm
pretty sure that's all we need to do cuz
I did I don't know setting spray oh yeah
I come up I come on I come on I'm going
to be using this drug cosmetics light
all day setting spray in the flavor
green tea not gonna like it literally
smells amazing mmm I'm so good I
just love sprays that make you like they
just have a really nice smell to them do
you not I mean and then of course what
can I do without taking a little bit
more mac fix+ just on my highlight area
so that is pretty much the finished look
a kind of a bold where I don't have my
hair down don't know um that is the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed
this little bit of a chit chat get ready
with me for I don't actually know I'm
kind of obsessing over this blue lip
color right now real talk check it out
