hey guys welcome back to my channel so I
don't really know what's happening with
my eyebrows today I've been playing with
some new brow products and they're
really dark but I hope we can deal
because I'm gonna be doing a full glam
look anyway so hopefully there aren't
too annoying so today I'm gonna be doing
a bit of a challenge gives Russia with
me full glam all appropriate so I want
this to be full appropriate but I want
to be full glam as well if you're in
Australia I know it's not full it's like
spring here heading into summer but if
you're Newberry parts currently fall and
I have a lot of a lot but I have a good
amount of American followers as well so
I do want to please both I will be doing
a spring summer look very very soon so
stay tuned for that but for now I'm
going to be doing a full full full full
glam tutorial for full glam fall for
that sounds stupid anyway I'm going to
be using the texture that rose gold
eyeshadow palette from who WT and yes
okay guys so I'm going to be starting
off with my eyes first and Jesus my base
I'm going to be using this matte
concealer now I just got this the other
day this is the Select cover-up
concealer so it's different from the
studio the what's a call I
always use it I don't know it went sit
in the shade and c20 so how many is this
is an eye base today that's I've got a
little squeezy bottle sort of thing so
I'm just gonna do that and then I
probably used way too much but I'm just
gonna share it with the other eye oh my
god so I felt like I haven't filmed a
chatty video in so long because the one
that you guys saw laughs the cherry
video one that I did was before I went
to Melbourne so I was pre filmed but yet
has everyone been going how's everything
has the weather treating everyone up in
like that end of Australia it's starting
to get really really hot like I think
it's hot here already and I hate the hot
weather so much like I always have but I
just hate it so much this time like it's
just it's killing me already
and it's not even that bad it's not even
30 degrees you and I'm saying that it's
hot probably because it's gone from such
cold weather to such hot weather so
quickly and like a really short amount
of
that's why I'm not used to it I'm just
gonna set that with somehow to just saw
it don't press on me whatever anyway
okay let's move on to the eyeshadow
sorry I'm going to be using this palette
here I kinda want to do the sticky tape
trick
I don't send up some sticky tape so
first color I'm gonna take is sandalwood
and I'm just going to be popping that
through my outer crease now I just did
someone put some I can't even talk I did
put some sticky tape just here just to
give me that nice you know line that it
gives so I'm just kind of putting a
generous amount of that through the
crease and I'm bringing it up really
quite high now taking the shade
man-eater I want to kind of put that
into my outer crease and kind of start
building up like that burgundy sort of
color and I can already tell I'm gonna
love this you guys know how I do I know
12 much when I do my eyes but when I
start my face that's when I do all the
talking because I'm like I'm really
concentrating when I do my eyes I can't
talk that much it's kind of hard because
it when I when I talk and raise my eyes
and everything which is generally the
what happens
so hello oh hey bitch I'm just filming
what are you doing a full full glam
makeup look eat my ass bitch ahh alright
guys so I've just been blending that
through my craves and like packing on
the color for quite a while and just
kind of letting it into that transition
color but not taking it to your high so
I lose the transition if that makes
sense now taking the shade of bossy I'm
just going to be going in and doing
exactly the same thing but just keeping
it lower just like him define the crease
small but I want to keep it super like
burgundy looking and like pretty I mean
I'm just going to take some a black
truffle along with bossy and kind of pop
it into my outer like eye part and just
blend it through
then taking the shade flamingo I just
want to kind of put that on my inner
corner just like make it really like
pink in there I don't know why I'm just
really feeling this swimming go color
and I might even just pop it for like
there that make sense
hello I love this color it's so pretty
have you seen Lee taking a combination
of rose gold ad and fling together oh
that's so much better
partly these shadows are meant to be put
on with your finger because it's the
best color payoff and I can definitely
agree this is no fix+ guys this is just
straight on the lid looks definitely
gorgeous then just going to take my
little blending brush that I used before
and just kind of blend around the edges
just to kind of diffuse that perfect
just where I want it now for my wing
today I'm just going to be using the
Engler AMC gel liner in 77
now just taking a clean makeup what I'm
just going to clean underneath let's get
started on the face I'm just going to
take some maca fix+ spray mmm can never
have too much of this for my actual
face primer today I'm going to be using
the Mac prep and prime natural radiance
base it's a yellow base primer so it's
yellow but then when you put it on it
goes on translucent so see it's yellow
and then you go like this look nice yeah
I haven't talked about one outside mmm
as you know last week I was in Melbourne
all the week before that I don't even
remember and I caught up with Chris Fox
as you guys know we did a video together
and can I just say some of you don't
have a sense of humor not that you don't
have a sense of humor judge just though
we don't understand our sense of humor
and how we talk to each other and some
people are taking a really serious thing
getting really offended I don't know why
because we weren't talking to them we're
talking to each other and honestly if
male Chris both got offended by what we
said to each other then like that just
wouldn't make sense that we would put
that on the internet yet let alone be
friends I'll say that also um yeah he's
one of the last people I've ever met in
my life you've got such a good heart and
he looks like a bird be cool be cool now
for my foundation I'm going to mix in
2000 together so I'm going to be mixing
together the Marc Jacobs remarkable this
is in the shade 35 in beige beige tour
and the bond this way foundation in the
shade honey so I'm going to mix these
together I'm a bit Ted at the moment on
my neck and so I'm gonna the knuckles lo
can they just not every time I
swear to God so I was going to take a
little bit of Born This Way on the back
of my makeup palette and I'm just going
to mix that with that remarkable so I'm
just evenly distributing this all over
my face so I'm just going to start
blending that all over my face and to do
that I'm just taking my morphe g36 brush
this is the best foundation brush for
what it comes to blending our
foundations that are thicker I'm going
to be taking a bit more left under
just going around the tops of my brows
and now I just take my Beauty Blender
and really push that in and blend
everything out all right guys so once
that's all blended out I'm gonna move on
chickens Cielo and I'm gonna be using
the same concealer I used on my eyelids

I'm just going to be putting that in the
usual areas anyway what's everyone doing

going to Warner ball because that's
where all my family lives and I'm going
to go see them for a bit which would be
good and then zoom back here before the
first of 2017 and flap my ass to
Brisbane now also a lot of you have been
asking where to get the Marc Jacobs
foundation because it's always sold out
in Australia I've been getting it from
the American Sephora website which is
basically where you have to go through a
shipping service
I just got concealer on my
eyeliner there's the worst anyway and
basically have to go through a shipping
service together from the Americans
before I because they obviously don't
trip to Australia and I put a post on
Instagram a while ago about this some
company called gross and so what I'll do
is I'll leave information down below
about that and I do have like some
discount code thing that gives you like
a VIP something I'm not really sure but
