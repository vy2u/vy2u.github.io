hey guys welcome back to my channel so I
was getting ready to other day very
quickly in a rush I have a few clients
during the day of today and I had to go
out and I had literally half an hour to
get ready which is hair makeup and
app√©tit I had no idea what I was
wearing I had no idea what I was gonna
do with my makeup but I did this thing
that was really quick I really ended up
liking it so I thought I would film it
today for you guys so this is kind of my
going out for dinner clubbing makeup and
cool glam in a rush
I guess so it's a really really quick
may go quick in my eyes because
sometimes I do take a very long time to
do my makeup so this is SuperDuper quick
for me yeah so I'm just going to start
by wiping over my face with a Neutrogena
makeup remover cow what six pack it
loads the other day and price might know
how to deal it was like to treat little
parts of tree or something so I got six
packets stock up because they're like in
my eyes they're expensive they're a bill
fifty when they're just like singly to
sell other than 25 in there so a bit
pricey I'll say did something a little
different with my brows today I didn't
feel the tops and I kind of just brush
the hairs off if you guys like this let
me know because my brows into really
controversial and I wish the web so to
begin I'm just going to take sticky tape
this is the exact same makeup that I did
the other day the only thing I might be
changing is going black in my waterline
and smoking it down a little bit more so
I should have done that last week when I
do them and I'm kicking myself for it
well now that I but you guys didn't get
in a little what I just do want to say
I've had a lot of breakouts over my face
last few days this quantity else was
Mars Jupiter Saturn and so on my whole
case is looking fast but we're just
going to deal with it the best thing we
want to do is take my touch okay
concealer in the shade that neutral
which goes double over it I kind of
watch you just get ready with me
reasonably quick because I feel like it
won't work whether into a quick the
whole point of this video is like a
quick last man full glam something you
know I'm saying the house dressings are
hard one was doing this when I was
actually in a rush
like oh my god next two sets that I'm
just gonna taking with the Artois
translucent powder in the light
make sure there's no creases in there
before I accept that
so my eyeshadow today I'm just going to
be using my favourites the texture rose
gold eyeshadow palette from crude of
beauty ah a shot that I'm using this
again there are you shot of course you
can use any brown eyeshadows to do this
look I just prefer to use as long as it
is a message especially I'm going to be
taking is a bay right here
just on a fluffy brush and I'm just
going to quickly blend up through the
crease because a little bit of extra
powder and what you're gonna paint gonna
have everybody and I'm also just going
to put that on my lid because we will be
using that lid space a little bit later
on
so I'll just taking sandalwood putting
it through my crease and kind of giving
that winged out of fact because we do
have the sticky tape there let's go play
a big part of this look so what has ever
been up to lately I have literally been
doing not much at all to be honest your
flag was Australia Day and I didn't do
anything
so I'm just going to take a little bit
more let's and what I'm just going to
really put that in my crease and just
deepen up that color now what this look
is going to be is a majority of the
color is going to be like out here and
it's going to be blended ombre into this
part here now taking the shade henna
which is this nice warm Brown orangie
like brick sort of color love it I'm
just going to start focusing start on
that out of V of my eye and I'm slightly
bringing that across all right so I've
just watch that eye shadow all the way
across here as you can see I'm just
going to quickly do the other eye so I'm
literally just taking the shadow and
just buffing it straight in nothing
special just putting it straight on
there and then like a blending upwards I
guess into their transition color
they're not to your heart because you
don't wanna lose your trans - now I'm
filling right back in with a little bit
more sandalwood just across the top of
that Hannah that I just put down just
because if you lose that terms
color you've always got time to get back
now taking the shade called
card row which is the darker Brown got a
purple like undertone to it but now it's
spreading I'm just going to smack bones
are right in the Addamses here and
lightly across then I'm just going to go
back to the brush that I was using with
henna which is that orange useless color
and I'm just going to go over the edges
of that to blend it out a little bit now
going into the shade here called black
truffle which is the black color my
favorite my show at the moment really
put that on that part of the area and
blend into cocoa and I feel like this
whole like and make up in a rush thing
this sticky tape really does help cause
you don't have to worry about any liner
we're going to be doing a little bit of
liner but just like no wing just
something really basic just going back
in with a little bit more courage and
blend that in half now we're going to
take a little bit more attend up and
just go over those edges and a little
bit of cocoa so what I'm doing is just
getting a little bit more black truffle
I'm kind of just gently blending that
across half of my lid and kind of I'm
bringing it out into bay and hey guys
now synagro back in with the color
called
Bay and I'm just going to put that all
across my lid and kind of blend it into
the black that I was petropia black
across my lid and what better than by
putting a little bit of a under my
eyebrows okay now for the part that
actually stressed me out I'm going to be
taking my English eyeliner to the AMC
gel liner in the shade 77 super super
super black stripping that drives very
very fast so I'm not going to talk
around do this part but um wish me luck
cool that's so stressful because I feel
like when you have hooded eyes like
myself if you make that line and too
thick it goes into your hood and that it
closes your eye up but it's just like
where I want so what I'm going to do now
is take that same jawline I'm going to
kind of just bring it into the black
shadow from before now we're not going
to do a wing today well that's still wet
I'm just going to take this little lens
brush here and I'm going to take the
black eye shadow from the fruit of
palette and I'm just going to blend that
over the eyeliner very okay now the most
stressful part is barbar I've just
written me out especially the English
eyeliner cause it's so black if you make
a mistake you're actually sucked and you
can't fix it you just I don't know it's
just as possible so I'm going to take
this tape off birds are satisfying will
ever cook underneath weather eye shadows
falling it a little crew sisters it's
going to take my makeup wet and just
clean my life I forgot that this
makeup weapon was an alcoholic brush
cleaner on it and I've got it in my
heart of like food that smells a bit
different so I can stretch it to watch
okay now that my uh show is all done I
feel like I take me to a bar probably
cos I had more time to do it this time
but I feel like it looks the same that
it does last time I did it when I was in
a rush anyway moving on to mascara I was
going to be using the tacho generator
blackest black masquerade in the sky see
how this goes it's not even doing
anything for my lashes no it's not I'm
not going to using this today sorry
Denson take my true face better than get
mascara I love how you guys love when I
say that because someone actually
coverage is Monday or I can't wait for
the day when someone going into Sephora
and ask for the better than Sigma scar
can you actually imagine that oh my god
for those of you who don't know it's
actually called better than sex but this
one reason I've just always said in
India for lashes today I'm going to be
using these lashes by Brian called
bespoke lashes I was actually set knees
this is in the style of Milan that is
what a day of look like so being sloppy
and staying ok so now that the tops of
my eyes are all dying I'm just loving
this look so much it's so simple yet so
receptive do not I mean so let's move up
the skin so I'm going to do exactly what
I did the other day where I actually
weren't in a rush so I didn't have time
to do no max plus razor prep the skin
none of that so my mom I'm
going to be using the Tarte clean slate
flawless 12 hour brightening cream eyes
because this is what you do today so it
was the first thing that sort of was in
front of me so I was like I'll just use
that just literally how I didn't get to
choose any products of the delicious
look I've got to get a shift on or go
soon I hate being like I need to be on
time everywhere I go I hate it when
people make plans and change it without
telling you until you bring it up do you
not I mean I can just give me anxiety
like once something is set in stone
and someone changes I'm like I guess
nothing serious like what for my
foundation I'm going to be going to with
my luminous silk foundation by Giorgio
Armani and this is in the shade 5.5 and
I'm just going to be applying this with
a paddle brush so hold on Facebook last
night and this memory came up from last
year I think and my friend personal
photo of me and her and you know how
there's always word like fuckhead
through always just have to say
something or whatever so I haven't had I
have a ship on Facebook like that
for a very long time and it happened
again that last night and I was just
like are you serious like they were like
what was that scene on the left
like what that seeing on the left and I
said a gorilla was kept when it came out
makeup kit okay well if you want to call
this a Kmart makeup kitchen not a
problem if you want to call me gorilla
fun I'm actually know what that is like
I get sorry I know exercise that I'm
used to it and I don't want to get messy
for this I'm not trying to get sympathy
because I put myself out there and I
know that a guy in makeup still isn't
the most
whole thing it's a little bit
off to my neck is an hour follow as
literally painted my whole entire neck
with this foundation just because my tan
is a little bit off today and I do want
to matching up today I'm wearing it this
shirt so I do want to all match together
which is absolutely stained anyway as I
was saying I know I'm going makeup I
know that I put myself out there I'm not
looking for sympathy I'm not here to
winch about the hey I'm just saying a
store that was over a very long time ago
like I thought you know this 25 year old
boys on Facebook were grown up in people
will excuse to the fact that they're you
know guys in makeup but basically not
anymore but you know what the thing was
I used to get so sore sort of sensitive
when someone would be like who's that
 like oh my friend folder or just
like just in general like I used to be
sort of been seasoned like I used to get
so angry by and also and your bias but
now because I get so much hey I'm just
like whatever like I think I should like
the comment to stand grow up look back
in the day I be like can't like
a circuit back in brewed like
 yourself like agents used to go
often like their absolute slacker but
now I just get so much hi I'm so used to
it though which is actually a good
things like I mean it's a good thing
there's all of the things that I get
paid but the good things that I'm just
like I just don't get affected by it
anymore which is so good because when I
first started youtube I like the
internet any single bad comment I'll
just write down in tears
so pretty much YouTube has made me a
stronger person it's given me more
confidence
actually it's given me a lot more
confidence which is just awesome
because when I first started youtube I
was like where I'm to get my small lips
because I have really small it's them so
going for my work on channel 4 I'm just
going to do this like others so shy and
like I didn't know what to say I didn't
know how to act
some people think I'm just at myself
when I've got a big head because I've
got you know a couple of followers there
but that's honestly not true that is not
sure
I do not have a big head i there is a
very big difference between having a big
head and having confidence and that's
what I am I just have got a lot of
confidence now which I'm so happy about
now do you need a little bit more
coverage on my acne prone areas because
a bit of that at the moment so they're
taking a little bit of Denmark Jake is
remarkable and just put a knife over Tim
does just going to paddle brush that out
and then blend over it afterwards so
just applying a bit just a little bit at
the top shake a concealer I'm just going
to blend that straight out with my
Beauty Blender plunger sorry well I love
this so much
okay I don't know why I didn't talk
about health might apply my concealer I
was having a moment I was having a
moment there's the back of my under eyes
and some take my art broad translucent
powder in my life I'm just making my
whole noise also dinner what I really
want try that concealer trick I thought
James child's door the other day he was
concealer all over his nose so he's
contour any foundation everything
doesn't slide off during the day so I do
want to try that one hand because it's
meant to make you shift not all slide
around which is perfect exactly what I
want yeah just get the rest of my face
I'm just going to take the Australis
fresh and flawless in the shade darkest
blue that Brown that was a
battle how embarrassing so I'm just
going to hit that all over the rest of
my face just to set that sound delay
Dacian or I just love this foundation
this looks like real skin pull them up
to everyone but normally I'm absolutely
Kate I'm still pretty tight right now
but little takes I know I am okay thank
you
moving on to oh my god so I said in my
last video that my conch you attempt to
go and muddy a lot and I want to change
that so I'm going to contour before you
brought there I thought running before
we control with help because it's more
powders being put down but we're going
to test that out today and contour
before we run I've never done that
before
and I'm terrified
but we're doing this together as a
nation moving forward together as a
nation to contour today I'm going to be
taking my trusty hoola bronzer or
hall-effect powder I'm just going to
start oh my god it's not going mudding
it didn't grow money oh my god I
actually look so good it didn't grow
money Wow well that is amazing so I'm
going to be probably contouring a lot of
our problems now thank you to whoever
comes that that is amazing as you guys
know I'm not a professional makeup
artist I learned all myself so I'm still
learning I'm not a pro don't have any
qualifications of just self-taught and
also just conjuring the absolute
out of my jaw also just running that
down the side of the nose a little bit
I'm actually so impressed with how this
contour look it's not muddy for a change
thank you so much - whoever commented
contour what before you bronze because
I'm a support off the way this whole
time I've been joined makeup this is a
game changer this has changed my life
thank you so much I really appreciate it
it's actually so cool I did not know
that okay so anyway moving on to your
actual bronze items means a little bit
today with my contour Lord in my opinion
this is the art friar bronzer in
Americana listen take a look at that on
there stippling and brush here and just
go a little bit above the contour now
let's finish off underneath my eyes and
get this book complete oh I'm closing
those from a watermark though so I'm
just taking standard wood and putting
that right underneath for my line now
taking the standard we're only speak a
fluffy brush I'm just going to blend
underneath my eyes so I'm actually
taking sandalwood a little bit of henna
and then a little bit of black truffle
underneath my eye to bring the whole
look together now we're almost dining
that I was going to take a little bit of
the Mac extended play gigablack lash
mascara just to do my bottom lashes and
I'm just going to slightly go over my
lashes cover to get a little bit of
powder in them now I'm going to wipe off
all of that excess baggage that we've
had sitting
for a while for my blush today I'm just
going to be taking a dis blush from
japonesque in the shade o - I guess this
look is pretty pink you sort of collapse
or I'm just going to take that on it
this brush here and there's a bit of a
blur to this this one's a bit of a
luminous globe - I'm not complaining
about that because I think it looks fine
now a powerful highlighter before I drew
highlight I just like to spray my face
with the maca prep and prime takes off
spray sorry then I'm going to be taking
the maca double gleam highlighted skin
finish this is like fairly new - I think
they just launched in January this month
so it's going to take that and sort of
starting this eyeliner so good day just
like take that along my nose bridge as
well I'm the very tip as well done the
highlights are absolutely say it with me
staying I was going to take a little bit
of that on the inner corners of my eyes
ball sorry just to brighten up that area
a little bit I guess just write down
that nice highlight but I'm just taking
my at damp Beauty Blender there's no
product when I encanta just working it
into the skin and I'm just going to go
over my cheek highlight as well for my
lip color today I'm going to be taking
Anastasio Beverly killed liquid lipstick
in the shade Archon now I'm going to
think I can not over line my lips I was
going to use a lip liner but I'm like
I'm gonna see if I can just chill for a
second with my list you know so I really
like the odor line and make them look as
big as possible but I'm just going to
reckon something different today there
is a spider hanging off my ring
wait are you serious
oh my god it's so quick so I just went
off camera - to my lips and oh my god it
looks so Jeff revised our mobile item as
March now I feel like I just want going
with a little bit of jeffree star
I'm nude just to life in the middle pipe
up a little bit just blending that out
of my finger now if you set my face I'm
just going to use the fatal day we're
dry cosmetics
as if you squat best explosive because
my not scarred this is the finished look
I really hope you guys did enjoy this
video I hope it inspired you should do
something with your Mac couple try
different technique or whatever
something like for example if you bronze
before you contour switch it the other
way and see if it doesn't go muddy
because I definitely let down in this
video so if you learn today make sure
