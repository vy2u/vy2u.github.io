hey guys welcome back to my channel and
oh my god here we go I have a chitchat
get ready with me verse 1 of 2017
are you ready strap yourselves in
because let's go now by the way I have
just ordered some great so I've got
fruit over there so if you see me like
you know Lurky mono no chips or a
chicken wing
yet iy d oh my gosh right so I'm gonna
I'm just gonna do my makeup and just
show the out and talk to you guys
because why the not
sorry I really wanted to change it up a
little bit and use something other than
huda beauty palette but honestly it's
like the best palette ever the only
thing I don't like about the huda beauty
palette is that these colors across the
top a very hard to apply sometimes so I
really love these matte colors here but
the ones across the top honestly make me
 myself because they're really hard
to apply and like it says apply with
your fingers but when you've got a full
set of you know coffin shape acrylics on
that's not really possible so pray for
me because I'm gonna need it so I'm just
gonna jump off camera and do my eyebrows
and I will be right back so what I mean
guys I'm eating like chicken wings from
Newberry thank you bindi no you're not
having any stop looking at me with that
under bite now oh my god I taste so good
mmm
there we go how's your beanie I know I
know what you mean
yeah
actually I haven't just scream
everyone's gone at the moment so I feel
like I can just screaming like yell at
everyone and everything possible okay
nevermind bears are done I have also
just done my eye base I use the top
shape shape can still enter set it with
some translucent powder so it does not
go anywhere now I'm moving on to eye
shadow I wanna do something pink why
I've got pink hair and pink nails clink
it's really gonna grow and I really want
to get rid of this pink redness sunburn
hotness on my face because it looks so
bad and by the way my skin is broken out
so much because shiny put a face mask on
me the other night saying it's going to
help your skin so much it's going to
break you out a little bit for the first
few days and then it will all go away
hasn't got away yet so it's still here
which is fabulous so we're going to need
to UM use a lot more foundation that I
normally do which is a ton to cover
that up
there is a moth flying around by the way
