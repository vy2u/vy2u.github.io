literally been the most amazing year and
I'm so excited for this year I've got so
many exciting things coming up I've got
so much planned I turned 21 this
year in September anyway I'm going to
get started on my makeup before I start
rambling on and just the whole videos
with me talking a bunch of so for
the makeup today I saw Jacqueline Hill
the other day she just like of gold she
did like a gold eye with the blue on the
inner corner Madeleine that was really
popular like everyone did the warm
Browns and then the poppers like the
turquoise blue like a year or two or
three years ago everyone was doing that
and she's flown back in fashion and I
got this palette the other day from
makeup addiction cosmetics and it's
completely inspired me to do almost the
exact same look so thanks Jacqueline so
I'm going to be putting this in my inner
corner okay let's not get too much away
let's do it I've got some new makeup
I've got
he's new collabo I'm gonna be testing
out today and I'm literally that's
 excited let's do it okay now that
I put you guys in nice and close let's
start with my eyes I'm gonna take the
doesn't even need an introduction so I
can motor back out there shut the
up trying to film here um oh my god so I
just got back from Brisbane at the other
day oh and I am a little bit sick so
excuse that Brisbane was so fun I was
helping SHINee move literally the whole
time I was there but her new place is
literally amazing and it's just
everything so I was just helping her
move and yeah was good and then we went
to the princess Polly and benefit event
on the Friday and it was so much fun I
literally got so drunk if you have me on
snapchat you would have seen so
embarassing regret it so much actually
no you know what I don't regret it live
life with no regrets and um it
was just so much fun like the whole band
I got to meet the benefit team and the
princess Polly team and they're just
like the nicest people ever like so like
genuine like you know still professional
but just like so much fun and like fun
to talk to and hang around with I met
some new people like some bloggers and
everything like that everything was just
amazing and the cocktails were actually
actually amazing as well and then on
Sunday
SHINee and Ronnie were having a meet up
and I was a little like special guest or
whatever and we I literally met over a
thousand people it was crazy so he she
came thank you so much for coming
I'll insert some photos here it was
literally the best date ever
it went for like five hours like just
standing there meeting people but it was
so rewarding and so worth it in the end
because I loved meeting you guys and
there was some like all age ranges they
would like these little boys that like
came up to me like his mum bought him
and then the rest are sailing and he
came up to me like as soon as all these
turn and he hugged me and I was just
thinking back to my videos how I swear
and I'm like I need a look like I need
to stop swearing but then I guess he
likes it when I swear so it was he was
so cute and like I just it was it was it
was it was just literally amazing
and I had the best day ever so rewarding
and so good and for the Gold Coast and I
actually really like the Gold Coast Gold
Coast is gorge the is all this
extra concealer happening all under here
just going to set my lids at a little
bit of the fresh and flawless in the
shade light beige there's so much
don't crease you know let's do eyeshadow
I'm so excited okay sir eyeshadow I'm
going to be using the makeup addiction
cosmetics flamin love palette and it's
absolutely stunning first shade I'm
going to take is this like really nice
brown color and I'm going to be using
this with my transition might be a
little bit dark for a transition but I
guess will work done out as we go all
very pigmented well okay I think I'm
actually going to love this my car
believe that this is literally like this
palette been around for so long and I've
never got it and they just sent me a
huge package the other day so thank you
so much guys I appreciate it so much
and I'm so excited because these shadows
are already AMA I'm loving it like I'm
actually loving this so I'm just gonna
blend that through my like ruse and
right um I do need a like a lot of
transition though I'm just going to find
one actually for my transition I'm going
to take a little bit of benefit cool a
lot because what I'm sitting down to my
new YouTube video actually cannot be

getting up once I've already sat down so
I just make do with everything that I've
got here so I'm just going to run this
over the top of that eye shadow and kind
of blend it out a little bit so what I'm
going to do now is I'm just going to
take that same brown shade that I you
been using this whole time and just on a
small denser brush so I can really get
that color on and I'm not even joking
the formula blendability pigmentation of
these shadows so far I am contemplating
replacing this mo who I'm contemplating
replacing this with my no I am
contemplating replacing my huda beauty
with this because I am just in awe that
I have not figured out to get this
earlier like I don't really see anyone
talk about this brand like I let people
probably do but I haven't seen anyone
talk about it and it's disappointing
because they're actually so good
and trust me Holmes I'm like the
fussiest person when it comes to
eyeshadow formulas because I want that
 to blend as soon as it's put on the
brush and put on the eye and like you
know build up the color not blend away
and it's literally done exactly what
I've wanted it to and I'm ready for this
okay so I'm just going to take a little
bit more of this a little bit more I'm
just going to start taking some of this
shade here this is like a dark brown so
this should like darken up the area a
little bit more I'm just going to pop
them out of V and it's kind of like it's
coming off black which is good because
that's what I like in eyeshadow only
like this I'm gonna go back to that
other brush that I just use the file
with somewhere that there's color I put
down just to blend that darker color our
just trying to pop it I'm just putting
it over the top more or less and just
kind of like
fussing I'm obsessed already like I'm
actually sold on this palette I love it
okay now Anson take a flat top brush
spray the out of it with some big
splash and I'm going to keep into this
gold shade just here oh yeah oh yeah
I'll get out of town what are you
actually serious amazing I'm going to
take my other brush and kind of just
blend those edges so it's nicely the
lender tower like I'm actually done I'm
actually sold on this palette AF talking
a little bit more on their love love
love love I can't wait to do the blue in
the inner corner but I'll do that when
I've done like my foundation and
everything okay I'm actually obsessed
okay let's do so I discuss them
 eyeshadow everywhere it's going
to clean up underneath my eyes just to
get rid of any fallout okay so for my
primer I'm going to be using the
professional map rescue primer from
benefit one of my all-time favorite
primers I love professional too but this
is like more it's more like liquidy so
it's easier to apply to the skin it's
not as like dry as professional muscular
Ã©stos or red when I put primer on but I
guess that's normal because you're
literally rubbing the out of your
face and circulating the blood flow
ready for foundational I'm not going to
do wings today either
well ah I don't think I'm going to do
wings just because I just want to like
chill and keep it cool foundation today
I'm going to be using the Elan comb tent
I doll ultra wear and I'm going to be
mixing it with a little bit of the
judger Armani luminous silk foundation
just because this is a little bit white
and I do like a little bit more color to
it so I'm just going to add a few drops
of this to darken it a little bit this
is one of my favorite combos at the
moment so last night I booked my flights
to New Zealand I'm going to New Zealand
in a few weeks for Chris's birthday I'm
so excited it's going to be so much fun
it's my first time at leaving Australia
I've never left Australia before I'm so
I'm so so excited I can't wait to leave
Australia and see what New Zealand has
to you know show me
but anyway so yeah I am turning 21 this
year in September and I am going to have
the best birthday ever I've never
actually thrown a birthday party and I
just want to have like I really asthma
have like my closest friends there and
just like really important people to me
what am i one of my best friends
yesterday I actually booked her flights
from here to Brisbane for my birthday
weekend because she owns a salon and she
has appointments and stuff like that so
she has to you know book it out that
plan in advance I think I'm so cute but
I'm yeah I'm literally so excited to my
birthday I want to do okay it's going to
sound so extra but that's because I kind
of been I want to have pre-drinks on a
yacht and go around either the Gold
Coast or Brisbane and then like get a
booth or something at a club and like
just have the most amazing night ever
the thing with blonde hair is if you get
foundation it you're actually
because it goes yellow oh wow you guys
seeing this foundation they're like
coverage it kind of looks like skin -
which is great and I'm using my morphe
sponge it's very very big it's bigger
than the Beauty Blender so it's kind of
hard to get into those cuts and crevices
that I forgot to point and the two sides
yeah what else has been happening in my
life I found an apartment in Brisbane I
looked at a few I found a few that I
liked so if I don't get this one then
I'm not fast but um oh my god
ah the struggle of blonde white hair
with sand ation and a dick able
literally did not think about this just
kind of blend that or it just blends so
well into my hair line to make
it yellow oh my god I cannot believe we
are almost at 400,000 subscribers never
ever ever what I've ever imagined to get
to this at all I think that's so crazy
and I cannot thank everybody enough it's
actually amazing 400 that's a lot of
 people like that is a lot of
people put all them into a room Wow
now to highlight my face today and under
my eyes obviously touch okay I don't
think it's possible for a brand to ever
top this concealer I mean I know there's
a few new things coming out this yeah no
I'm pretty sure Jeffrey's got a
concealer and foundation coming out I
know here to beauty has a full coverage
foundation coming out which I'm so
excited to get my hands on because I
feel like all huda beauty stuff is just
so good that's just my opinion but I
love it everything is working really
well today
don't seek to sue in lemarchal Nek
minnit muddy contour now to highlight
under my eyes I'm just going to take
that shape tape again just go to town
like I always do yeah I saw a comment
the other day where someone said that to
put concealer that fly down on your face
you must have know cause I literally
have the biggest pause but when you
pounce your Beautyblender into them this
more or less fills up your pores I know
that's disgusting it sounds gross
lighting does obviously help that is a
huge factor but it honestly is all in
the makeup too I guess but lighting does
help a lot if you have good lighting
you're going to look ten times better
now once your under eyes are all
concealed
everything I'm just going to take this
sponge and my Aussie ma and just pounce
it into my under eye area
now that's baking away I'm just going to
set the rest of my face of the Australis
fresh and flawless in the shade light
beige dusting like patting motions and
I'm just going to tap over the edges of
that concealer so it kind of all blends
in together so just like around here
over my nose my forehead is tapping okay
so now it's time to contour and give my
face a little bit of something-something
I'm going to take all of light on the
morphe our fourteen brush seen a lot of
people using this to contour lately so
thank you excess off that you don't
need okay and I'm gonna go straight in
on these cheeks
mmm I'm gonna just take my time blending
and contouring town I'm in no rush
all of that is the best thing that's
ever happened to me I love it
is it just me or I find this side of my
face a little bit harder to contour like
I feel like this is always better and
this isn't as like good is that just me
does it happen to other people to be
like you've got like this is my good eye
and this is my annoying eye that never
works but it's at the same with
contouring because happens to me all the
time
okay now to bronze up my face I'm going
to take my marker Jacobs 102 tantrik
Omega bronzer and start I just sort of
had to sort of crack then I think it's
all good it's a big crack in the middle
but it's not it's not broken which is
good so I'm gonna just add this over the
top of my contour just to like warm
everything up a little bit more all in
here sorta like matches up you know and
can't forget the big old jolly
forehead I won't be in contouring my
forehead as much as I used to lately
just because I don't know I just don't
like it as much I kind of like that more
like softer sort of look do not I mean
okay guys now to finish off my under
eyes and was going to take that first
brown shade that I went in with and I'm
gonna put that directly under my lash
line I've already done the Cyclops is
testing out to see what it was gonna
look like Thanks so yes straight under
their hand oh my god guys another thing
I quickly wanted to touch on was I do
not use a blurring filter in my videos I
never will
just saying that I'll never use it
because someone comment to the other day
that I use it and that's a compliment
because I don't use them say thank you
that I look like I've got the blurry
filter on also people always try and
call me out on Instagram for face
treating my photos of course I face
tuned my photos i sat on the plane the
other day when I was coming back from
Brisbane I was face tuning the face
tuning a photo for 45 minutes like I
don't try and hide that I edit my photos
like I love editing my photos it's like
fun it's a part of the process but yeah
I just wanted to clear that up and it's
not like it's not giving a true
representation of Who I am like if you
want to see what I really look like with
that or the pastry and everything come
watch my videos you know what I mean I'm
about this is so good I just put a
little bit more of that on the darker
color underneath my lash line she like
make it all bit darker under the die
there we're going to loving this or
March now for mascara for my top and
bottom lashes I'm going to be using D
Mac extended place is one of my all-time
favorite mascaras ever so I'm just gonna
pop this on for my lashes today these
are by a brand called lash Warriors and
these are in the style Asha and this is
literally the only lash brand
I've actually been wearing lately and I
need a race flock of these I do also
have a discount code I don't think it's
an affiliate code but I'll leave it down
below it'll give you some moola off and
save you a you know a bit of money yeah
all details about that will be left down
below but these are the lashes here and
they just they're amazing like
it's all I've been wearing lately on
instagram if you've seen a photo like a
selfie of me I'm probably wearing these
lashes right so I'm just gonna put a
little bit of the House of lashes lash
glue along the lash band and I'm gonna
let it go tacky for probably like 30
seconds actually why that's drying I'm
just going to take just a little brush
here and just get that dark brown from
that palette and kind of just put it
across the top of my lash line just so
the lash band kind of has something to
blend into a little bit because I'm
actually sometimes I have those days
where like my inner corner lash just
does not want to stick down it flies off
but and also just don't care
okay now I'm
the bronze that made cheeks a little bit
modest with a bit more of the bronze I
just cuz I feel like it just needs a
little bit more and my whole base
when I say a little bit I mean a lot
okay okay my eyes are almost done now
for that in a corner with that blue that
I've been wanting to do I'm just going
to spritz my brush with a lot of fixed
glass thank you and then I was going to
dip into that the blue shade yes okay so
I'm just kind of bringing it a little
bit underneath here I'm just packing on
the color until it's pigment said to
where I want it to be
Nelson take a little blending brush and
just kind of blend around the edges so
there's no you know harsh lines are just
blue just hanging out you know okay I'm
just going to do a little bit of blush
now for my blush I'm going to be using
the benefit gala for Nia blush ha so I'm
just going to get my all that's probably
a lot I'm just going to pop this on my
cheeky little squat and kind of blend
back into my contour and bronze art I
think this is one of the nice color
blushes ever it's like the perfect color
for my skin tone talk I swear I said
that every video so if you like Casper
the ghost like me then pieces blush up
its got like a bit of like a luminous
glow to it as well just very slightly
and that's also really nice yes I'm just
going to add more because why not
the more the merrier you know the bigger
the better okay now let's do highlighter
now this is I'm going to be trying me
like I'm just going to spritz my face a
little bit of thicker plus actually a
lot and now I'm going to be taking the
other glow highlighter this is the new
or our collaboration with
nikkietutorials and today I'm going to
take my honest I see are a 23 is that a
23 and I'm going to dip into I'm not
going to go into the orange but I'm
going to dip into these two top shades
here more this one because I feel like
that's more my color and just kind of
mix them a little bit and then we're
just going to ready wait we'll do the
side first ready
get fox oh my god I'm literally obsessed
I'm just going to add a bit more of the
darker color because I feel like it's a
little bit too light like Wyatt well
that's absolutely stunning I'm obsessed
okay over this side used to hate putting
highlighter I'm like um like before
remember when highlighter wasn't like a
seeing it working like a big deal like
oh my god it's so pigmented a beautiful
like remember when that wasn't even a
thing but now it is and I used to hate
applying it but now I just love it can't
forget that nose tip here and the bridge
I just switched to the morphe r-36 for
my nose because it's a little bit
smaller then you can it's easier to
control I guess and cannot forget to
 up my cube my cuba cube I'm just
going to add some more with this and
some more 6 plus can we make it a bit
more intense on my cheeks you know there
we go for I'm talking about okay guys
now for my lip color I'm going to be
taking the nude a potion or a liquid
lipstick which is a part of the
nikkietutorials collab and I do have a
discount code it is Michael Finch see
yah I do get a little bit of commission
if you guys do use my code but it does
save you 30% off I'm just going to see
how this color goes it might be true
like what do we think I kind of like it
it's kind of pretty
what do you guys think I don't think it
clashes at all I think it looks really
nice so this is the second layer that
I'm just putting on now and now to lock
everything in place I'm just going to
take my Urban Decay all nighter makeup
setting spray or long-lasting and dry
myself
