channel so today I'm going to be trying
out a bunch of new makeup I'm so excited
because I've got so many new products
I've been wanting to try out for such a
long time now majority of them are bye
bye you can buy them at Mecca and
Sephora so places like that of course no
one's have touched me but when I start
filming it happens gel that is
definitely a problem so I'm going to be
trying out a bunch of produce products
to it without any further ado let's get
straight into this video how are you yep
no no but you got nice and close let's
get sausage sorry the fact I'm going to
be trying out is this soft matte
complete concealer bind Oz now I know
this was being out for quite a while now
but I just never like had it to use in a
video and test it out and give you guys
my more so first impressions on it so
I've already gone up my eyebrows as
y'all could see so I've heard really
positive things about this concealer and
I'm very excited to be honest oh my god
coverage is amazing so I'm just gonna
start by carving out my brow just
underneath the brows now I really need
to get my eyebrows done
sorry badly this sorry messy and I'm
just gonna bring that concealer all down
on to my lid holy crap the coverage of
this concealer is actually amazing guess
who remembered who wet their beauty
blender for a change this guy right here
I'm just going to blend this concealer
out
wow it's so full coverage as probably
isn't my color I actually stole this off
shining so that's why it's like dark
because I like a really white concealers
and really like because you know I'm
hasty I'm hasting I'm not tan at the
moment but um we are just gonna make
this work
jump oh I don't even have a new
powder to try out oh my god yes I do
bye I do too I like to set my others in
place today I'm gonna be trying to be
Maybelline a mapmaker mattifying how do
they're perfectly this brightens up the
concealer a little bit because it is a
little bit dark
well it's Christ already damp that is
definitely a problem blend they're not
again done actually don't wait to do my
brows done my friend Skye has like a
ud certificate and stuff in brows and
stuff and stuff and stuff and stuff yeah
so I don't know why I'm putting my
eyebrows in her hands because I don't
know if I trust her with my eyebrows
done I'll let you know how that goes
now it is time for eyes shadow today I'm
going to be trying the naked urban decay
heat palette now I know jealousy can be
doing like warm tone or looks but this
whole palette is actually only warm
tones so there's not much I can do about
this and a lot of you guys have been
asking for me to try this out I've heard
really good seems really really really
good things about this so I'm give it
well done alright first of all I'm gonna
take this shape called so let's do it
the list and what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to put that in my crease okay
Wow very pigmented very very pigmented
Mindy okay Wow very pigmented sis I'm
telling ya blendability so far so good
dump whatever you like this okay so I'm
just going to blend up through my cranes
and come out there you know I do I'm so
excited about this I should have Hallett
it is providing the absolute good Dell
I'm gonna keep blending them now I'm
going to take the shake oh hey devil and
I'm going to take that on this small
definer brush and I'm going to bring
that up
ah and bring it all the way up through
my crease there wasn't likely spend a
hey I'm gonna bring it all the way into
my inner corner like literally all the
way in there done I'm going to take some
more of that shade that I just used
before and I'm just gonna go over the
edges with that and kind of just blend
it out you know what I mean the next
shade I'm going to take is called envy
you go well that's a bit of a different
name isn't it Dell I'm just going to pop
that a little bit lower than where I put
that shade before I don't you pop it
over my whole lid amazing if there is
one thing about this palette that I
don't like the fact that there is no
black in there that's annoying because I
reckon every single pilot needs a black
you know I mean because you can either
go light or you can you know a greater
challenges I'm just going to take a bit
of black eyeshadow the one I'm using is
from the hood of beauty parlor I'm going
to put that like kind of all over my lid
and then I'm going to take and if you go
the calories before from the Urban Decay
palette
put that over the edge and kind of just
blend it up nice not loving the full
outer gel but that's normal
okay now that that's done sort of wipe
off all this fallout now I feel like I
haven't done a wing in so long so I'm
definitely going to do one today
I'm going to be trying out the Tarte
clay pot eyeliner this is just the black
one obviously okay so here we go sis
here we go okay so that is very little
what I'm kind of liking it so I believe
it now you guys know I love tart as a
brand but this was not the best eyeliner
I've used it was a little bit patchy and
I had to kind of go over it to get it
really matte black so yeah so it's why
my mascara today I'm going to be trying
out the essence volume stylist 18 hour
curl and hold mascara with micro styling
waxes done that is a mouthful a
spin D I'm sure she'd agree so I'm just
going to pop this on wow this is good
come on essence let's do it don't now my
lashes once again today I don't know
what they are I just found them in my
lash case that is what they look like
Dell oh my god that looks so freaking
good are you kidding me bindi okay now
that my lashes are on I'm just going to
go and shave my face because I am a man
and I do have a bit of stubble and
foundation does not apply well when
stubble is in the way done so I'm just
going to go and shave my face and I will
be right back guys before I get started
on my face I just want to show you this
little tool that I've sent the other day
this is the gTLD makeup brush cleaner
and Raja this is the packaging for it so
this is one part of it here and this
comes off you can recharge this with a
USB either in a wall or from your
computer which I think it's so good
because I feel like everything needs to
be USB rechargeable these days without
modern technology and then it comes with
this little Bowl here that's super cute
it looks like a little fish tank and the
makeup brush cleansing solution so just
got to put a little bit of water in this
baby here then it's glass - super classy
and these are all the little attachments
here that come off so I'm going to
choose this one right here so you just
basically put this onto this hair done
and then it's got three different speed
things so one two
so very very fast to can guard like it's
so important to clean your makeup
brushes like every couple of weeks
otherwise bacteria does grow in them and
that is how you can get acne I just put
a little bit of the cleansing solution
in here so basically what this also does
is it draws your brush as well so it can
clean it and drive within 20 seconds
which is pretty amazing so then what I
do is I just pop the brush in here two
three all right so that's cleaning
nicely in there gel and it was really
dirty when it when it was covered in all
that eyeshadow and then you can pull it
out and it's like spinning it around
like this and then you turn it off gel
and there it is literally as clean as a
whistle and it is it is dry and it's
ready to literally use again if any of
you guys are interested in buying this I
will be leaving the link down below in
the description ok now for my foundation
today I don't actually have a new
foundation that I can try out so instead
what I'm gonna do is I'm first of all
going to spritz my face with some of the
Marc Jacobs perfecting coconut setting
this I'm a huge fan of Marc Jacobs will
makeup I think it's so sleek in the
packaging ass on fleek all the time I'm
going to shake this up and give my
 drink a bendy now I'm also going
to take a little bit of the Marc Jacobs
do do you coconut gel highlight up mm-hm
nice now bought these ones from Sephora
gel so I'm just going to put this all
over my face I know it's a highlighter
but I may use ads or strobe cream
because I'm literally the Tin Man when
it comes to highlighter a little bit up
on this forehead here to gel for my
foundation I wanted to use a foundation
that I've barely ever used so this is
the Milani conceal and protect
foundation and I love this
foundation it is literally that good
okay now this is in the shade natural so
it's perfect for my skin tone atm I'm
just going to take a paddle foundation
brush this is the morphe 57 a lot of you

much all the rest of the fans going as
well done so that should be super super
exciting I don't even I haven't even
looked at the lineup to be honest I have
no idea who is going to splendor like
who's playing but I'm actually going to
do that after I finished filming this
video also 9 and a percent sure that
this gel highlighter is actually like
kind of shining through a little bit
it's giving me a bit of a glow I don't
know if you guys can tell but I
definitely can it's such good coverage
like it's so good are you guys seeing
this
what do you mean now for my concealer
today I'm going to be trying out the
benefit buying industrial-strength
concealer now I would literally send
this today in PR so thank you so much
fantastic you guys know I literally am
obsessed with your brand and I ride your
ass so hard
only because I truly believe in your
product I also have the best marketing
and PR team and I'm literally obsessed
with them all Emanuela and Sarah if
you're watching I love you both so much
so I'm just going to take this I'm gonna
start concealing the areas as third okay
so I'm put it in all these areas here
jump and then it's going to take my
Beauty Blender and go to town yeah I'm
going to take that same concealer and
just pop it straight under my eyes yes
time to get a tan gel I just blend out
under the eye let's all look what I love
what do you mean
holy yes benefit is the new touch
that tape is it down
it's literally doing exactly what type
shape tape does just a little bit less
like heavy I liked looks heavier oh my
yes sis come on kind of obsessed with
this concealer are you serious
now unfortunately I don't have any new
translucent powders to test out so I'm
going to go back to the RTM a just for
today not just for today but I haven't
used it in videos in a while so bring it
back down haven't seen you in a long
time Dell how are ya okay so I'm just
going to dip straight into my RC MA it's
going to bake over my whole entire nose
okay literally always do now to set the
rest of my foundation I'm going to go
back to that Maybelline powder they used
to set my lids before I'm just going to
set over all the rest of my phone diddly
squat Dacian you know off BD well
setting it super well okay I just wiped
off that bake also because I don't want
to sit at there for hours you know Jo
okay so I'm going to get back into that
bourbon decay palette and I'm just gonna
take the shade called Phyllis Diller
they also take a little blending brush
and more so blend that halfway down my
face in case you guys haven't noticed
already I love to bring my eyeshadow
down to my actual jaw line now I'm going
to go in with the shade called heat
devil again I'm basically just doing
what I did on the top seam underneath
then I'm going to take a little bit of
the shade called and you go and just put
that right up against my lashline I'm
also going to take a little bit of the
black from the hooter Beauty color and
just put it right up against my lash
line just kind of just on the outer V
actually I was gonna bring it all the
way across I'm just gonna go I had to
finish the desire and I will be right
back guys okay sis moving on to bronzer
I'm going to be trying out the makeup
geek bronze ibises in at the shade Sun
kiss it looks stunning I'm so excited so
I'm not sure how pigmented this is how
it's going to go on I probably wouldn't
use this as a bronzer I probably use it
more as a contour color cuz it's a
little bit more cool toned rather than
harge I like it it's good so I'm just
going to contour everywhere that needs
to be contoured which is literally my
whole entire face so how many users of a
contour today know a bronze up because I
feel like it's just better as a contour
this color for me you know bindi just
really hit that jawline there done this
is actually a really good bronzer I'm so
impressed
I'm not surprised there I've always been
a huge fan of makeup geek products
it's very pattering I think that's why
it blends so well I'm just going to run
this down the side of my nose because I
kind of look like Voldemort when you
know you know it's get blocked in all
that concealer and foundation don't he
just got to contour the out of it
and pray to God that you know still
going to be there in the end and I'm
sure mine always will be there now put
bronzer today I'm going to be using this
palette here from NARS and I'm going to
be taking this shade here to bronze my
face a little bit more so I'm pretty
sure this is just Laguna which I have
used before but I'm using again done
it's very cool toned very cool toned I
feel like all two and suits my skin
better but I really love or any bronzer
you know what I just love being super
sunkissed looking an orange like you
know I don't care people think I look
orange because I love it and if
you want to be orange tanned go ahead
and be orange that looks so natural you
know what I mean like it looks so
natural ish now for blush I'm just going
to take a little bit of this shade here
out of the same palette and I'm more or
less just going to pop that on my
cheekbones and kind of blend it in
through the bronze I'm the conjure and
everything like that just to bring a
little bit of color back because my face
is looking quite you know odd at the
moment let's go a bit of a nice glow to
it as well which is cute for my
highlighter today I'm going to be trying
out the Urban Decay afterglow
highlighter palette but before I do that
I was going to take a bit of the cover
FX illuminating setting spray now I put
this on my skin the other day just see
what it looks like without any makeup on
and it made my skin look so glowy and
like
strobing and the packaging is so sleek
on this is kind of like sending
holographic I don't really know how to
explain it but there's like tints of
purple in there it's only 9 and there's
a bullying that too kind of smells like
an aerosol can dump the sprit site is
sorry fine it is
sorry knives not chunky at all so you
can just go to town and spray as much as
you like
it was at this moment that even if he
 up
oh oh oh my god
um honored it is a setting spray but I
forgot that it was illuminating I don't
even know what to say Joel okay look I
can fix this
I'm just gonna take my Beauty Blender oh
my god it's literally made everything
like ten men looking like I mean like a
scourge but it's all over my eye
shadow I don't my know what he means
this oh my god
holy okay I don't know what to say
like I'm actually lost for words
don't spray as much as you want because
well you're going to end up looking like
this I mean it looks nice but in person
it's like wow you are literally a 10 man
you are a mirror I can see myself in
your reflection self
anyway I'm just going to move on to
highlighting now I'm actually going to
take a little bit of fix+
now I'm going to go into the shade
called bliss just tears that to dr. know
that should be worth like a champagne
nice lot of color hello okay a nice
highlight a blast I'm gonna change my
brush up oh there we go oh that's so
pretty
woah that is nice well I'm just going to
keep packing your otters bye I mean I
look like the 10 min already may as well
just make my whole face and my
cheeks look
okay I just look super glowy I mean I'm
called dirt not the factor at all
through my eyebrows though that's a bit
of a problem
get that Cupid's bow there gel well I
love this okay so now that my highlight
of my blush and everything is pretty
much done let's move on to my lips
what am I going to use oh now I have
used it before but I haven't used it in
such a long time so I'm gonna use it
again down this is a new person this is
by or for cosmetics this is the nikah
just world collaboration i'm pretty sure
i'm not going to really over line my
lips or anything i'm just going to kind
of keep them like this I love this looks
very much bye and then I'm going to be
taking this gloss here this is from the
brand's UA and this is the energy shade
PCH whatever that means
yeah and now to set everything in place
I'm going to be taking the Marc Jacobs
Spray again imagine if I made the
mistake that I just didn't thought this
was the cover effects on engineering
look at the packaging by I would
literally jump off the nearest cliff
Dunning and that smells that too good
like literally it was like an actual
coconut pie okay guys so this is the end
