nothing in my car my goal of what I do
and as you all know I'm having a meet-up
in Melbourne next week and I'm beyond
like nervous and I'm so excited at the
same time because doing a meet-up by
yourself is always like super like
not that I've done one but like what I'm
feeling right now is super super nervous
but like at the same time I'm so excited
so I've got like mixed feelings about it
but you know I'm so excited to meet you
guys and to everyone that's coming I'm
beyond excited to meet you and if you
are traveling from like a curette like
if you're driving like an hour or more

hill pallet once that is a problem like
Panama Fox I'm going to be taking as the
Jaclyn hill palette and I'm not going to

I'm gonna it up okay shot

transition he sort of color imma take
one of these up and he baby Oh someone's
did a massive skit out there that's a
problem okay so I'm gonna start buffing
this into my crease uh sorry my Benji
Benji Benji haven't seen bindi in about
two days and I'm having withdrawals
already and I don't know how I'm doing
it but I'm either right now I was so now
I can start a little mix and see little
mix I love little mix like I'm one of
those like mainstream like I love you
know in the top music um but I decided
to film instead because I haven't filmed
in so long so it was either filming or
Little Mix and I chose filming so so
afterwards I'm just going to go on
youtube and watch Little Mix live just
so I feel better about myself so we went
to Splenda last week me shiny like
literally everyone Lily
Skye like everyone went to splendor and
we stayed in this beautiful house in
Byron Bay and beginning boutique took us
there and can I just say when you like
come across a brand with an amazing PR
team it just makes everything so good
like I just oh I love it I love it when
brands are so beautiful and so nice and
like genuinely like a nice person it's
so easy to work with them if you know
what I mean there we stayed in this
beautiful house in Byron Bay was called
Babel cottages or something for those
who were interested if you ever need to
go to Byron and you need a house hit
them up amazing not sponsored which it
was though it was just so freakin
beautiful and nice and it's Slade it
literally slice over in the house it was
me Shawny Lily the - Herbert twins um
who else was there
Carly burns Armani Scott love her love
Callie so means guy yeah that's it and
then a few girls from the beginning
boutique team and honestly it was so
much fun
Linda was good Splenda was so so fun I
met so many of you guys like sorry many
of you guys who's gonna take this pretty
rose gold shade and I'm just gonna pop
this for over my lid here we go then
just a nice little you know pop of color
on that lid bed so I love this palette
so much
if you ever need to get a good palate
that's like semi affordable I think it's
like I think it's $45 worth it so
where's that I mean the huda beauty ones
ninety-five dollars and they're just as
good as each other pretty much this goes
in my top palace my top palette says
food of beauty bottom a nice ones by
anastasiya and the Jaclyn hill
collaboration with morphe you will now
say I'm going to draw a wing because I
really rarely do wings actually I do
them all the time but I'm adoring today
I'm going to be taking the my goodness
i'ma take the Maybelline studio gel
liner just on this more for the m-16 / 1
/ 1 6 brush that is a tongue twister and
then imma just go to challenger this big
fuck-off wing and I'm really excited so
you guys didn't know the Maybelline
studio gel liner is a good droop for
baking blot MC gel liner in 77 so good
favorite drugstore eyeliner over I'm
just going to kind of bring it into my
inner corner do like a little cat flick
I don't know if I what is cool
I don't know sorry about 3.5 hours later
I finally have my eyeliner done this
part on the inner corner is not done
fully glitter one we look so different
okay guys moving on to the face I'm
going to be taking the L'Oreal Paris
lumi magique Primark this is very
beautiful I think it's like a dupe for
the back of back lash primer to be
honest because they both do the same
thing in my eyes this is just a little
bit more moisturizing and like it just
makes your skin so glowing like a look
at that by for my foundation today I'm
going to be taking the luminous silk
foundation by Giorgio Armani and I'm
going to mix it in a little bit of the
Lancome T and Idol ultra wear 24-hour
favorite foundation combo ever I was
like what is this foundation and I mixed
in a little bit of this do hey just what
are you doing just how's your dating tip
so I'm just going to paint this
literally all over my face like an
actual painting and like an actual cake
I've been breaking out heaps lately - I
don't know why I think it's because I've
been wearing makeup so much and like
wearing makeup at Splenda everyday and
then like sweating at the same time and
it's just like also because your pores
open up when you sweat obviously and all
just so into my father's and I'm like
this is a problem okay I don't mean to
toot my own horn here but when I mix
these foundations together it is my
exact skin tone like it's perfect for me
it's friggin perfect literally almost a
spray
brush cleaner on to my beauty blender
that was going to be a problem because
it's alcohol and it would sting like
crazy I'm just going to take my Beauty
Blender and blend this all out yes I
bought some new beauty blenders the
other day and so for our two packs there
and put some new ones sort some of my
girls in Sephora the girls at Sephora in
pack fair oh my god this or nice I met
the nicest go hand in with Shelby Shelby
I think oh my god so nice so helpful and
just so cool I love when you go into a
store and have good customer service
that's always so important to me because
I'm like yes now I want to come back so
if you ever go to pax they're in Sephora
if you ever go to pack their Sephora for
Shelby because she will help you
tremendously so I'm just going to blend
all this fun diddly-squat Dacian and to
me skin you know jump once that's all
blended out I'm then going to go to my
touch ape tape and I'm going to just pop
this in the areas where in me to
highlight well thanks you guys getting
sick of me using this because if you are

eyes with the touch okay that's nothing
compared to what I usually use let's go
with that and see how we go because I go
through a Juba shut I can't even talk I
go through a tube of shut I just did it
again I go through a tube of
heart-shaped tape every month not even
so that's enough to conceal the
under-eye bags you know what I mean like
you don't even need as much as I
normally use I just like to go for cake
face you're on Amazon I'm just going to
dip into a little bit of the curry s fun
and just put flip back right in up on
there I can't not bake I'm still going
to show you about this the other day

miss Chris so much I love Chris it's
gonna wipe off that bag too because I
don't really need it to be honest now
I'm going to keep my under eyes quiet
minimalistic today so I'm just going to
take just a little brush and just a
little bit of something some underneath
my eye I'm just going to take this brush
here and I'm just going to dip into the
transitioning color that I used on top
of my lid straight underneath the eye
you know perfect now to join up my top
to my bottom I'm just going to take the
essence extreme lasting waterproof
eyeliner pencil and I'm going to pop
this in my waterline and this is so good
oh my god just going to change a little
completely because I have to smoke it
down because it's so thick so I'm just
going to take the black shade from the
morphe palette and just oh I wanted
to do a light look but that is not going
to happen now so I'm just going to smoke
it this black down so it's a little bit
more blended but I'm going take a little
bit of the warm Brown from the Dracula
color and just going to smoke that down
a little bit I did not intend for this
to happen it just happened I'm sorry now
to contour guys I'm going to be taking
the essence shape your face contour
kisses flow my favorite drugstore
contour kit LR
and I'm going to take this shade right
here black Diaz and then I will put it
on my face luckiest luckiest luckiest
luckiest luckiest and it does contour
you so well like it's the perfect
torrents on my skintone and I mean
literally obsessed with add contour this
big fuck-off
forehead yes you better snatch these
cheeks head I love contouring my jawline
like as I have been losing a little bit
of weight lately
contouring my jawline is so much fun
because I kind of have one now John I
mean I'm also just going to take a
little bit of that contour shade just
down the sides of my nose did you get a
little bit lost in that concealer just a
rough job nothing too special I can move
on to different things so I like to do a
little bit of contouring then I move
back onto my eyes so for my mascara I'm
going to be taking the Tarte lights
camera lashes this is such a good
mascara it's like jet black which is
thick because that's what you want in a
mascara and then I was going to use the
same one on the bottom lashes for my
lashes today I'm just going to pop these
babies on these are from a brand called
Jamila lashes and I'm literally obsessed
with them just give it a quick little
blow okay whoa and now that my lashes
done I'm going to be taking the Milani
excell bronzer although the glow hon
give me a bit of a glow give me some
glow so this can be some globe in give
me the glow I'm going to take it on this
multi brush that keep shedding on me but
that is not a problem because I love it
I actually really like this look it's
turned out quite well
you know I thought it was going to turn
to when I started doing the
eyeliner underneath but you know just
call me Kim K because that's what I've
been looking like smokey eye s bitch
just going to run this bronzer order on
my neck also just give me a bit more of
a bronzey sort of look rather than being
Casper the ghost you know so you look at
all the shedding you say that by that's
a problem that kind of a sucks what can
be if I buy a new one
actually it's like a feline Pat wait a
cat is a thin line isn't it I don't know
now for my blush I'm going to take a
little bit of the gala for Nia blush
from benefit just on the same brush that
I used to contour and I'm just going to
pop that on my cheeks just to give me a
bit of cooling in our butter color
because color is good now for my
highlight of today I'm going to be going
in with the Mac highlighter in the shade
double clean I've not used it since it
actually came out and that is actually
crazy first of all I'm just going to
spritz my face with the Kat Von D look
at setting this because I have no idea
where my mac's fix+ is gone and I
literally just bought any one the other
day but whatever so I'm going to go to
town on my face tears and then I'll let
it dry a little bit somehow that it
doesn't go a patchy because my light
always goes patchy regardless of what I
do that this helps the process and not
go hacci
where the fuck's my understaffed
fresh corn hmm did someone steal it this
could be out there it is no one stole it
feed yeah now I'm gonna just dip into my
highlighter and it's gone patchy ah
mother of dick why is there a big
striking line up highlighter there could
you guys see that I don't know if you
can catch it on camera but it's pissing
me off
 you whack I'll just add more and
hopefully it off you know because
I don't got time for that I'm gonna put
a little bit of highlighter above my
brow or Fleur Fleur get on get up here
why is it patchy yeah you know who I
blame for that bindi she's the
culprit of everything and I was gonna
put a little bit on the tip of my nose
and my cupids bow to my lip color today
I'm gonna be taking the Amalfi a liquid
lip in the shade brunch yes I could do
with the brunch right now I'm so
hungry and I'm just gonna pop this on
you know just my lips are really big on
my that's fine though I'm happy with
that I love a bit of a sausage on my
mouth not in there
so yeah so it's looking good okay now do
set my face a little bit more I'm just
going to take the cat one gee look at
setting this once again slightly I just
love drowning myself in it cuz I feel
like it just works you know okay guys so
