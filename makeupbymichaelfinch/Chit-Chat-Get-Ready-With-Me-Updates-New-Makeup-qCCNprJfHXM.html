channel so today I'm gonna be filming
just like sitting down talking to
everybody doing my makeup I've got heaps
of new products that I want to test out
and by the way if I sound louder than
normal is because I can't hear out of
this ear because I'm still thick
so bear with me but today I really do
want to test out the nikkietutorials
power of makeup palette I've heard so
many mixed reviews about this with
feathers for like almost a month now and
I still haven't got around to using it
so I'm going to give this a shot today
and see what happens well so I literally
cannot believe it's already the 27th of
October I believe it's almost the end of
the year already it's almost like I
blinked and everything was over and what
am I accomplished this year I don't know
I'm just taking my Kat Von D concealer
in the shade warm of youth is a few
times now and honestly it's actually not
even bad like I don't expect it to be
bad brush on my using what do I
have on this honestly this concealer is
a really really good it's really high
coverage honestly I feel like the more
concealer you put on your lid for
eyeshadow the better that eyeshadow
stands out just my opinion anyway aadmi
are moving into the nikkietutorials
power of makeup palette and I'm first of
all just going to be going in with these
two brown colors at the top here I feel
like the transition is so important in
certainly makeup looks because if you
don't have it then what color you gonna
do between your brow and you lid I just
don't understand so I'm just taking that
all the way through my crease and just
really blending that out to make sure
there's no harsh lines whatsoever so um
I want to talk about something that it's
really a touchy shot subject to the
moment cuz it's quite new in the media
but if you live in Australia or I think
it's like ah worldwide news now there
was a four deaths at dreamworld the
other day in Queensland full respect
goes out to the families and the friends
of like the whole incident it's really
really sad what had happened and I have
been seeing some particles around lately
that it was neck
now I don't know what that means I think
that's don't quote me on it but I think
it's where they knew or they planned it
or I knew it was going to happen or
something was going to go wrong I don't
know but either way if they knew
something was going to go on and do
anything about it that makes me sick
I've never been a like a fan of theme
parks at all just because I feel like
they're so G and after watching Shane
Dawson's video
I like deaths at theme parks it's just
like me up completely like when I
was in Queens at last I was driving past
that um the giant drop and like I
watched a drop and I just shut myself
like I wasn't even on the ride and I
still shat like my heart is wet so I'm
loving about this palace the whole thing
smells like cocoa powder just like all
the shadows and everything oh it's like
infused taste taste so good of course
I'm gonna say taste
don't you love it when you just like go
into your makeup and all you bring your
blending brushes are completely
they all look like this dirty yeah
right should clean before but I just
don't have time for that
now just taking the color makeup and
chill which is like the dark sort of
brown I'm just going to be putting that
up through the crease again and kind of
creating any crease but not and honestly
guys the pigmentation in these eye
shadows so far is just the same as any
other eye shadow that I love like makeup
geek morphine I don't start stare like
they're blending out seamlessly as you
can see that there's nothing wrong with
them they're not patchy I've seen so
many mixed reviews on this palette and I
wasn't I just bought it like I saw
really good ones and really bad ones and
honestly majority of the bad ones are
just from course of channels trying to
make you know video is to try and get
views like they're not even makeup
artist and they're just talking about it
just for the views like it's just
pathetic so yeah I thought I'd buy this
palette myself and test it out myself
and so far throw a good Niki touch so
far so good
now just taking the shade wanted and
backing with a little bit of that dark
brown mixing them together just on this
small definer brush I'm just going to be
going into my outer V generously with
that black and brown this is always so
scary doing this stuff
 out of me so I'm bringing that
right through the crease that Brown
really dark and now before I do anything
else and we go back in with that brown
shade that I use the dark one and same
on that same brush and just blend that a
bit this is a really cool turned I
haven't done cool turns in so long so
once I'm happy with how that's all
blended out and then going to move on to
the lip color and today I'm going to be
using this green color here called
mystic hour which is so pretty so I'm
just popping that over the lid area and
from what I can see it's not very
pigmented and a lot of for that has
happened maybe because I put too much on
the brush I don't know but what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to sweep
that away just why do my eyes first guys
but what I am going to do is to take a
bit of fix+ and wet brush just to make
it a little bit more intense maybe
that's what I need to do to really get
that presentation which is what you need
to do with majority of eyeshadows what
do you think bindi yeah for my latter
today I'm gonna be taking the tarte
precision eyeliner and just doing a bit
of a wing so i just did those wings off
camera just because it's like a lot
easier to do now i'm going to take some
neutral and you - genophix like these
are Kim Kardashian's favorite by the way
they're expensive like eight dollars for
a packet but my opinion so worth it
because they're so good the other night
calming ones but there is daytime ones
you can get to just cleaning up
underneath my eyes now for my lashes I'm
just going to be using the l'oreal paris
voluminous carbon black mascara because
it's so great I swear I've been trying
every single mascara lately and they're
all really really good now for my lashes
today I'm just going to be using these
are from pen house lashes they were nice
enough to send me a pair of these for
their massive minky fluffy looking
lashes so I'm just going to stick these
babies on and I will be right back and
we'll get onto the CPS all the
difference of lash can make okay guys
now that the tops of my eyes are done
we'll do the bottom afterwards let's
move on to the face for the face primer
I'm going to be using a body band the
bobby wrap the Bubba valid
vitamin-enriched face base why I talk so
far sometimes I start let's live static
for the whole thing just fell out I shut
everywhere say uh so I was going
to take a little bit of that out with
that because I have acrylics on and
using a Beauty Blender because it's not
even wet I mean I always forget to wet
my Beauty Blender I'm just going to be
putting that onto my skin and really
getting this into every little crack and
crevice not that there's many anymore
thanks to Alex pike now guys I was sort
of gone wet my Beauty blunder for once
and I will be right back
okey dokey now that my Beauty Blender is
nice and wet for a change from the tap
 setting spray I'm going to
be moving on to Foundation and for that
I'm going to be using the Marc Jacobs
remarkable one of my favorite
foundations one off not the best and
this is in the shade best glide 22 so
this is my non tan sort of color it's
got a bit of a yellow undertone but not
too yellow
other times totally bother me because I
always make it work in the end in my
opinion I make it work so what I'm going
to do is just let this for I'm just
gonna pull the coverage of this bar I'm
actually diddly dead love it I'm just
using my morphe g36 brush to blend this
out before I go in with a Beauty Blender
just because this foundation is so
 thick but those little dots has
literally just covered all that and now
for my big jolly nice hanging out as
well oh my gosh so what do we all think
I know I'm really late talking about
this but the Kim Kardashian the Kim
Kardashian robbery though so scary the
poor thing I can't believe people are
saying that she made that up for
publicity and then it's fake I don't
think anyone would do that I don't even
think I know I know she wouldn't do that
it's actually up and like all the
people trying to say that it is fake and
stuff I just have nothing better to do
with their life so for my concealer
today I'm going to be using this o frost
skin sculpting one in the shade dawn
it's a sculpting one but I'm pretty sure
you can use it as a concealer as well so
that's what I'm gonna do I'm not sure
how this works
coverage wise anything like that so I'm
just going to put a bit on my chin first
and then just blend it out with my
Beauty Blender
okay just could work so this stuff not
only brightens but it also conceals
which is circle
it now I'm just going to pop that
underneath my eyes as well let's see how
this goes coverage wise well I'm
actually really impressed check that up
actually works so well for concealer and
it's very thin as well so I feel like
it's thin but full coverage if that
makes sense I really like what this has
done it's really brightened up that
under-eye area
I'm just going to be baking underneath
my eyes with the RC o mundo color powder
as always now she set the rest of my
face I'm just gonna be using this
japonesque pressed powder in the shade
zero one just on this big-ass a fluffy
brush and I'm just going to be patting
that all over just to make sure this
sets everything completely now to bronze
my face I'm going to be taking this here
this is the Bahama Mama bronzer from the
bar not too deep part of that ages ago
just cuz I hated the little contacts of
area so I'm just taking that on a big
fluffy brush and just starting to bronze
up the face now the thing that I have
totally forgotten about this bronzer is
it is not too orange it's more cool time
which is perfect for what I'm not tan
because look it suits of so well and I
think I've just fallen back in love with
this bronzer again because they used to
use it a long time ago like when I first
started making YouTube videos and yeah
ever since then I've only really used it
not much at all I got a sort of comment
on my video the other day and I was like
ok guys now I'm just contouring my
jawline and someone Road now I'm just
contouring my jawline wear it out though
oh I was like that is so savage that's
true though like where is it that is
like it's there when I go but I'm just
going to my jawline I'm not contouring
I'm making one that's why I should say
I'm making a jawline so eat my
asshole I am just going to be contouring
my nose ever so slightly and I do have a
fully dedicated video on this so just go
through my channel and you will find it
if you want to know how to really snatch
the nose now the contour a bit further
I'm just going to take it this shape
here called indefinitely by makeup geek
it's just more of a cool toned control
I'm really tap your brush off because
he's a slow pigmented lip sorry
pigmented
so I'm just contouring ever so slightly
you can never go through him on the
contrary when you're pale like me
otherwise it goes muddy and that's what
I don't like it up not being tan for my
blush today I'm just going to be using
this Tarte blush here in blissful I'm
just putting it on my cheeks and just
blending it into my contour and bronze
out a bit now just to put underneath my
eyes I'm just gonna be taking the old
fried banana powder I'm not going to be
taking that on my favourite brush for
this this is the morphe e53 and I'm just
going to be packing that on under there
and down the bridge of my nose
okay now let's finish off underneath the
eyes so I'm to take a little bit more of
those two branch aids from their Nikita
palette and just placing that right
directly underneath and I'm just going
to be taking a teeny little bit of that
black and just popping it on the outer V
just so the wing kind of joins up with
it not so it's noticeable just so it
looks a little bit more joined up now
I'm just going to dust the way the rest
of that Bank now for my bottom lashes
I'm just gonna be using Mac extended
play gigablack lash mascara because it's
the best for lengthening them now just
to put on the inner rim of my eyes I'm
just taking the tight inner rim liner
and what this will do will just keep my
eyes nice and open rather than putting
black in that waterline now we are
almost done just moving back onto the
face I'm going to be taking the
highlight color from the Nikki taps
palette called champagne truffle so I'm
just gonna take that I might other
starsia brush and I'm just going to dip
that into there and just go straight on
to the skin so it's not a very pigmented
like that in my mouth that tastes
or wood it's not very pigmented as you
can see just from a first flat may
because I baked too much I don't know
but what I do with all my highlighters
is I just spray it with a fixed plus on
the brush and then I dip back into that
how about and then just go so yeah okay
so I've really with this now
there it is see you just need a little
bit of fixed class bring a little bit of
fix passed into your life and it all
works out in the end
you know what sometimes I like my
highlighters not too pigmented and this
is actually pretty good for that bar
keep getting that I'm just going to
 like link
 dick ginger ah if you
guys have not eaten these I'm sorry but
you need to can't forget the Cupid's bow
this is a pretty highlighter okay not
all highlighters have to be pigmented
this is a pretty highlighter a
little bit across the tops of my brows
it's on the outer parts now let's do a a
lip color I have no idea what lip color
I'm going to do no idea actually I'm
going to try this out this is the tight
lip paint in the colored choker so I'm
just gonna without pigmentation hello
how are ya oh it smells minty don't like
that so the color is a lot darker than I
expected it to be so I'm gonna take a
little bit of jeffersonian in the middle
just to line it up a little bit so that
is a much better color in my opinion
it's just a little bit latter which is
what I like with my lip colors so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video I'm a trying
out a few new products talking a little
bit about random things that are
happening in the world and I hope you
enjoyed me using a pale foundation for
once because I know some of you really
like that and some of you really don't
but this has just me at the moment
because I will be tanning tonight so I'm
in the process of getting it all off as
you can probably tell from my dark
knuckles still it all the dead dry dirty
skin around my fingernails but anyway I
hope you guys enjoy the rest of your
night day wherever in the world you are
and I will see you all in my next video
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
