still underneath my brows at the radiant
creamy concealer from NARS I'm going to
conceal on the top with some Mac Studio
Fix foundations in the shade NW 25 and I
got this the other day it's like a
little metal pallets thing to put
on so it's a bit more you know it's
sanitary enough to use the backing hand
and up your tan so I finally bought
the real Beauty Blender and everyone was
like stop using fake ones like you can't
call them Beauty blenders if they're
like sponges four dollars from Kmart or
the chichi ones all the real technique
ones so I wouldn't actually bought the
real thing this is $61 for sponges look
I just can't bring myself to doing that
but everyone was just like you need to
it's so much better so I'm like okay so
I've got this pack cup tacky is
the packaging it's so ugly it just
reminds me of like a four year old girls
like makeup or whatever it's foul but
there's a little baby one in there too
so I'm kind of keen to use that and see
how she goes funny thing about this is
they try and advertise this is water and
mean Alex we're talking about esa they
try and advertise this as water it's
like an on the go like seeing like what
the anyway I'm just gonna go on wet
one of these and she'll be that anyways
as I was saying before um yeah I was in
Melbourne and we wouldn't got our teeth
whitened at this place called Pella it's
on Chapel Street it is so much fun they
give you headphones to listen to staff
it's really comfortable the treatment
goes for 30 minutes and it's $130 for 30
minute treatment which i think is really
good she's why she is why check her out
her so I'll leave their Facebook page
down below you can go and check them out
if your interest in getting your teeth
whitened in Melbourne now I feel like
I'm just gonna do my eyes first because
like I still black Oh dick that's the
troubles of having a small table here
with like no room at all everything just
Falls everywhere
and bigger bush pig mess and there's
you know thinks on it so I'm gonna dive
straight into my makeup geek shadows
today I'm understand the jus like
something through the crease that I'm
gonna put something on the lid okay does
that sound good sweetie she's gone for
it and thing what's happens okay
speaking of makeup I had a client the
other day I did like a really intense
black silver smoky eye and she came up
to me I'm obviously not gonna mention
names she came up to me in the club and
was like thank you so much for doing my
makeup like you have no idea how much
self-confidence and gave me and I'm not
just saying this because I'm drunk like
she really really liked it and that is
honestly the best feeling about what I
like doing what the reason why I do
makeup is number one it's so much fun
it's like paint in somebody's face
number two seeing people's reactions to
when you've done it like it can change
their self-esteem
it can give them a new view on life that
might sound a little bit too deep but
honestly it's true I just freaking love
it like I love it I could inspire
someone to you know start wearing makeup
like there's nothing wrong with wearing
makeup if you don't want to wear makeup
that's fine but you can wear as much or
as less as you want and you know
everyone is different so I'm confident
enough now when I go clubbing sometimes
I don't wear makeup anymore just because
it's easier on me and you know it gets
hot in those clubs and I'd rather just
not deal with like last week I
went clubbing
I want to makeup at all and I don't know
whether it was just the fact that there
was really nice people out or I just
didn't want makeup and there were no
fuckhead starting of course she's
interrupting my YouTube video what does
she want the fortune was really
interrupted so I just did some eye
shadow you know just some basic now
we're going to move straight into the
lid color so when we taking color pop

straight onto that eyelid ah now I just
what this yesterday this is the Too
Faced glitter glue Jacqueline Hill has
been raving about this so let's

Australia she's got like blue hair and

she put a snapchat up of her leg exposed
with emojis over it and emojis never
worked like there are ways around that
you can like jailbreak your phone and
you know get rid of the emojis and the
text someone did that so now who needs a
leaked and she's kind of complaining
about it dude if you send nudes you've
got to think of the consequences like
just don't do it like if you want to and
you trust someone do it but if yours
breakup or whatever then you know don't
have a cry does that make sense like
