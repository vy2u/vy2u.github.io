feel like I've not sat down and done her
talk through video and style and I've
just been doing voiceovers the reason
for that is because when I do voice
service I can listen to music I'm more
in the mood for it but today I'm in the
mood to talk to everyone which is
what I'm the best at doing so today I'm
going to be going for a cake to be
honest I have no idea what I'm doing I
just have just got the colors green and
grey in my eye and I'm just going to
work with that so first thing we're
going to do is get the two-faced lip
injection extreme now if you don't know
what this is this basically has like
extract in it and like I think there's
some sort of chili in it and I don't
know it says Turbo Power plumping lip
gloss I think it retails for $51 don't
go and purchase this thinking that
you're gonna love it
because you need to test it with
disposable applicators from David Jones
obviously because you don't want to put
the real thing in your lips that's
disgusting yuck hurt me heaven it smells
really good it smells like bubble gum
but then like the it that like the stuff
kicks in and it's like whoa like you
need to calm the down so I'm gonna
be changing up my makeup a little bit
differently today I feel like I'm gonna
do my face first I'm gonna do my skin
first and then do my eyebrows because I
kinda want to change up my eyebrows like
everyone on Instagram is like having got
me for my brows and I know I shouldn't
change to anyone but that like I feel my
friends is headed to Lucknow I'm just
like looking back at it and I'm like
holy like that I really like
intense and some people don't like them
which is totally okay but I love them
but I'm gonna see if I can change it up
a little bit because I want to change
when they cut every now and again if you
don't think so for primary today I'm
going to be going back to my benefit
Porefessional this is my holy
 grail of a primer and I use
a lot of this stuff
let's move straight onto the skin first
what I'm going to be doing is obviously
just primed the out of my face for
foundation today I'm going to be using
timebomb foundation by the balm and
she's probably expired to be honest
because I've had it for so long but I
just rediscover that I've got it the
other day oh no it last 24 months
probably had it for about
long so it should be fun now to apply
this today I'm just going to be taking
this brush here this is not a real
artiste brush this was about I think I
said four three or four to three or four
dollars on eBay I'll leave the link down
below for anyone who's interested
basically what I'm just doing is just
getting that like a lava ah that
coverage though I live and I'm just
going to be plastering this all over my
entire face until it is all covered up
in one of my Instagram videos the other
day like I do like little Instagram
videos I love doing my little Instagram
videos um I was like doing this with it
and someone was like you're not made to
do that like use it like a beauty
blender and I was like first of all you
need to calm the down
second of all I was experimenting okay I
wasn't sure how to use it so yeah I've
been told from randoms on Instagram that
you mentioned dragger but I feel like it
leaves little lines in your skin so I
just go over with a Beauty Blender
because well it's great for application
like it's so quick like as you can see
this is like the quickest way to apply
foundation I just had to deal with me
little lines but I don't
there actually is I haven't had a decent
look at her this foundation is so thick
like it like you can feel that you've
got stuff on but the coverage is
immaculate and that's what I want in a
foundation full coverage foundation here
all day every single day so yeah okay
I'm gonna get my Beauty Blender and I'll
be right back so I'm just gonna be
blending over the areas that I think
need like a little bit more smoothing
out you know what I mean for conceal her
today hey I'm gonna be using my Urban
Decay Naked skin weightless complete
coverage concealer this is in the shade
fair neutral by the way all products I
use will be listed down below or and on
the screen right now the thing I hate
about is concealers when you open it
it's like got so much processor it's got
so much pressure sometimes I like flings
out and goes all over you which is like
kind of annoying but I mean Yolo I still
prefer my NARS radiant creamy concealer
it is my club is now and I need to use
it up like it's not the worst concealer
I mean chuckling your brand's about it
so I need to grow to love it let's be
real sure so I'd be dead without a light
concealer like I love concealing I just
love going overboard you know people
just get so shocked from how much I use
but don't what happened there I'm trying
to turn it down
lately not because I'm listening to
people but well I am but at the same
time I'm like you know what I can just
do what I want let's make up it washes
off at the end of the day we all know
this we all know this I wouldn't be
surprised if some of you think I'm on
drugs right now because like since when
do I do my face first I don't think I've
ever done it on my channel at all first
maybe I have but I'm not like used to
doing it first like normally I do my
eyes first cuz I fall out but I just
banged the out of underneath my
eyes and everything's all Jade I mean so
yeah I'm in such a good mood today you
have to be in the right mood to do a
video like talking like a makeup
tutorial people ask me like do you get
bored of YouTube I don't get bored of
YouTube and I don't think I ever will I
think I just get unmotivated and like
you need to be in the right mood to film
a video there's no point in filming a
talk-through video a makeup tutorial Ike
you need to be in the mood to do it you
really do need to be in the mood to do
it and that's what I've learned and
that's what I'm just getting used to so
you really have to be in the right mood
to do it like I just said like a million
times so I'm taking something that I got
the other day it's feeling you never
used it before okay I've got to stop
making that joke because it's
stupid
checking my odious bone powder amazing
if you live in America you're welcome
because it's like six dollars or like
Walmart and Kmart
to get it from Australia it's like a lot
more expensive a cost an arm and a leg
well turn in like 30 bucks but still
some people might think that's expensive
in my eyes I kind of do considering six
dollars over there it's like thirty here
so yeah anyway so after blending out my
under eyes completely I'm just gonna
pack on this product and I mean do not
be scared with this because we guys you
know we're working with greys and black
eye shadows you can't be scared to like
spritzes over your entire face like it's
literally all over me check it out se
acabó Oh to set the rest of my face I'm
taking the Naz price powder there's just
in the color Beach I'm kind of scared
it's gonna be true yellow for me but
let's just have a look because I mean
everyone uses this color so let's see
how it goes
tonic she's all genie so I'm just gonna
set the rest of my face with this and
then again surprise surprise just a
little bit more airspun
just so we don't get any shutter on here
now if you don't know what baking does
look don't quote me on this because I'm
not
so but I know that it stinks into the
natural oils and your skin so it
disappears and before I used to bake my
makeup was easy to get off now that I
baked it is so much harder to get off
under my eyes like it's so thick so
that's a good thing I mean who does a
little bit of thick makeup let's do some
eyebrows today I'm going to be trying
something new I'm taking the rap power
super skinny in cosmetics brow pencil
and I've never used this before so as
you can see I kind of just fill that in
ever so slightly in my opinion compared
to what I normally do I'm just like
filling that in with this pencil and I'm
trying to get perfect cause I don't want
to go around it but concealer because it
defines it a lot more and I already put
powder down and I hate going over cut
out with liquid so I'm just going to
finish this brown in this brat and I'll
come straight back to you guys now that
my brows are all filled in as you can
see I've toned it down a lot but that's
a good thing now I'm dipping into my
makeup geek shadows that I've got going
on right here okay so basically what I'm
good I'm just going to zoom you guys in
a little bit okay so I'm just gonna be
taking a light gray color so this one
here I'll leave all colors and all the
names and stuff down below and I'm just
gonna go smack bang right into that
crease on a fluffy brush and this is
from XO Beauty it's the eyeshadow blend
up because this is going to be using the
transition you guys might think it's
quite a bit dark for a transition but
after all this is gonna be a gray eye so
it's all going to be quite dark
ain't no Peach Smoothie orange soda up
in here we're all about the grades today
I'm trying to keep this look quite
simple so it's like easy to follow now
I'm going to be going in with my zoeva
to 3-1 luxe petit crease brush and into
this darker shade just here and just
kind of like it down a little bit more
so like down about here then I'm just
going to be dragging it through my
existing crazy little coupe so I'm just
keeping everything off the lid but I'm
just taking my blending brush that I
just used before and I'm just slightly
blending that together now going into
corrupt which is the black color down
here from makeup geek I'm just gonna
define just the outer V so I'm not
bringing all the way while I probably
end up well because well we all know I
love to go so dramatic okay so now
moving on to my favorite part I'm going
to be doing the lid color
okay now I've been waiting to use this
for quite a while now this is makeup
geeks new shadow this is called venom so
good right and it's like a green I'm
just going to swatch it for my finger
that's how pigmented it is incredible
right I'm obsessed and then I'm just
gonna be plopping that straight on oh my
gosh I'm living this so much I seriously
love that I don't know coming up very
well on camera but I love this so
 much I love green eyeshadow I
love green while with brown but grey
plays it as well going back into makeup
geek erupted again I'm just gonna be
taking this little tiny baby brush here
and I'm just gonna push this straight
into my lash line just because I'm going
to be putting lashes on and we don't
want to see that do we so I'm just
going to go straight under my finger
now just make sure you blend that down
so there's no little harsh sheets you
know now just with a little bit of black
eyeshadow onto my brush straight under
now that all of that is done we can dust
away all of our bait because
it's been sitting there for about an
hour so mascara today I'm gonna be using
the Too Faced better than sex this is my
new favorite mascara sorry they're real
