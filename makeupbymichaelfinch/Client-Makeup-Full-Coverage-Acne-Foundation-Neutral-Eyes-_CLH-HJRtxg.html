today I'm gonna be doing an acne
coverage foundation routine on the
beautiful free as you can see she's got
the world's most horrific acne I'm
really kidding
hello yeah and she's not gonna be
talking I might just do a voiceover
she's actually really sick so she can't
talk she's been sucking too much dick
let's just get straight into the
tutorial and I'll show you how to cover
this up yeah
okay guys the first always starting off
with a bit of fixed class by Mac because
her skin was quite dry and he's you know
getting into the colder weather just to
moisture up her face now we're going in
to benefits Porefessional and i'm
pressing that into the skin with a
Beauty Blender rather than swiping and
pressing all the products in cuz I feel
like it just like gives more coverage
and it lasts longer for foundation we're
going to be using Mac's to do is
foundation and I'm matching her face to
the neck so as you can see the color
difference I'm just gonna be matching
that up because the face is quite a
different color from her neck so I'm
matching that up and once again I'm
using quite a lot of foundation and I'm
pressing the product straight into her
skin so pressing the product into our
skin is much better than swiping and it
gives a much better coverage you know me
I've been going in with the pro longwear
concealer from mac because we like them
grow and Luang but I'm using a concealer
that's the same color as your foundation
you don't want to use anything lighter
or darker because it's just gonna look
really bad you want to use the same
color then for highlighting concealer
under the eyes i'm using the la girl
concealer and this is in the color light
ivory I'm pretty sure it's one of the
lightest ones you can get so I'm just
applying a generous amount under her
eyes but I think I've put a little bit
too much on there as you can see but
that doesn't matter
we just blend this halfway up her face
and it will worked out in the end
let that no blended one
now to set her bake I'm gonna be taking
their spun protein powder which is one
of my favorite pantheon so great no
flashback you can use as much as you
want it does smell like old granny
vagina but that's totally okay it does
the job and I'm obsessed with it
now to gonna get get get get a corn to a
girl look at first time going
contouring your face with the benefit
hoola bronzer it's like a matte face
powder so it's great for contouring sand
have any shimmer to it pretty much so
I'd be I'm just contouring her face with
that and I'm snatching her nose with
that as well
now bronzer i'm gonna be using mac oh
what's a cold
give me some bronzer I bought this
because desi Perkins uses it like a Holy
Grail non-stop and it's not all that
pigmented which is kind of what you want
in a bronzer so it just gets like a
little bit of southern Sun and that's
what it looks like
foundation and base down
I lied the base isn't John for
highlighter we're going to be using
Becca champagne pour and just
highlighting all the areas of my face
so make it look sassy that's how and
then we're going to be going in with the
Laura Mercier invisible setting powder
and just doing you know a little baked
onto that contour I just cleanse them
you know clean it up a little bit
now just to deepen up the contour a
little bit I was thinking that on
associate Beverly Hills contour kit and
yeah just deepening up her contour ever
so slightly
now for the eyes today we're just going
to be using the many mu a X makeup geek
palette and I'm just going into those
two brown shades and basically what I'm
doing with hooded eyes I keep asking my
client to open their eyes just so you
can see because you want to still be
able to see the brown when their eyes
are open so you need to you know find
that area where it's still going to look
good when their eyes are open and their
eyes are closed so you need to find that
that sort of line that there is
now I'm going to be going in with Coco
bear which is my holy grail I shadow and
I'm also going to be going with a little
bit of corrupt afterwards which is what
you'll see it's just a dark enough that
out of the area
now for the lid color I'm going back to
the mani palette and just taking that
spicy looking shimmery shade in there
and just packing that onto our lid and
as you can see I got a shitload a pull
out but I just split that off anyway I'm
now muscari guys probably thinking why
are you using just by the by mascara
wand um that's because it's - car and
brain is my friend sir we don't really
care with just with probably bad but
we're just doing it anybody we don't
care its benefit they're real mascara
natural lashes today I'm going to be
using House of lashes temptress with the
Clio
House of lashes eyelash glue and as you
can see I'm showing you guys how I put
eyelash glue on an eyelash so I put
quite a lot on the bed and then on both
and I put a little bit extra let it go
tacky and then you know stick it
straight onto that lash and then just
like play with it until it's totally dry
and it's in its place then I'm going
back in with some more color there and
corrupt underneath beyond
you have to highlight the inner corners
and the brow bone I was going to use
champagne pop but I decided not to
because it's a little bit too intense in
Champagne II so we just went with mac
soft and gentle and then in the
waterline I'm using the makeup geek eye
pencil in the color nude for bottom
lashes I'm using the Mac extended play
gigablack black extended mascara
this is amazing for bottom lashes Alex
got me onto it once again this is my
mascara that's one which is exposed one
with Kara one get over it and then for
eyebrows we are using Anastasio brow Pro
palette
then bullets we are using colourpop's
I'm pretty sure it's called teeny-tiny
but if I'm wrong I'll leave it down
below um
basically I don't use colour-pop on my
clients she's my friend so I'm just
using the lip thing I don't know her
because we don't care once again but
yeah I'm just applying that and trying
to get it as perfect as possible and I
think I succeeded pretty well oh yeah
that's power look feet just getting that
line all the way and then to set her
foundation and everything I'm just using
the Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray so that is the end of todays video
this is the finished product I hope you
guys enjoyed all the products that I use
we'll be down in the description below
if you missed any yeah I'll see you all
