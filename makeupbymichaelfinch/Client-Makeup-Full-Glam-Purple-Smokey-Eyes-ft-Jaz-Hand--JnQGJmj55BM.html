hope you guys enjoy this tutorial this
is really fun to do I haven't Li done
purple on a client before while client /
friend or whatever so basically I just
go straight in with the Mac Pro Longwear
can still out in the shade NC 15
to use as a base for the eye shadow this
covers everything and it's not true
drive so it's easy to spread and blend
and then just setting that with a little
bit of powder to ensure that my shadows
don't stick grossly to the eyes then I'm
just taking the more feet the more feet
35p Hallett and I'm just starting to
blend in some purple shades into the
crease area sorry through the clues and
I'm just taking that through the crease
and the outer V area I'm just taking
like that I literally use a million
different shades of purple to get the
look that I wanted and so I'm not
showing you what shades I used but every
single purple shade in that palette is
literally amazing and I'm obsessed with
it so I'm basically just blending all
those purple shadows out and hoping for
the best if that makes sense as I said I
really didn't know what I was doing I
was kind of going straight for the
jugular
just assuming you guys in a little bit
just so you can see a little bit better
I'm just taking a blending brush and
blending all those Purple's together now
purple is one of those colors that can
be quite hard to blend it might not
stick as well as other colors can or
other colors do so yeah just going very
purple is hard to work with sometimes if
that makes any sense and then it's
taking one of the really purple shimmery
shades in that palette and popping that
straight on the eyelid and I also did
grab some of the white shade from the
palette ooh shimmery white shade and
just pop that underneath her brow bone
to make it pop a little bit more and
also blend down that purple if it was
too high and then just taking corrupt
from makeup geek and I'm just putting
that in the outer V because the black
and the morphe palette wasn't that
blacks I wasn't black enough but I liked
it so I just put that in the outer V and
kind of blended that through the purple
diffusing the black so it's not that
noticeable that there is black there
so as you guys can see I'm just blending
away and lifting up her eyebrow to
really get in there and making sure
everything is seamless and smooth now
moving on to the wing I'm just taking
the English eyeliner in 77 I'm just
getting her to look straight ahead
because I'm lining that up with her
bottom lower lash line now if you guys
struggle with doing wings on other
people or yourself I suggest you just
look straight ahead and do a wing
following your bottom lash line straight
out or straight up depends on how curvy
or straight you like your wing opening
the eye and felt see how I'm following
that bottom lash line straight up that
will help you a lot just to your eye
shape all your clients a shape that I'm
just driving that down straight on to
the where the lashes go I don't know
what that part is called so it's where
the lashes go and just kind of going
along there and making that all black
and then I did also go in with a little
bit more of that shimmery color just to
touch up and make it a little bit more
pigmented and then just wiping away all
the shadow that has fallen this where do
I first I still like it better
moving on to primer this is the Too
Faced hangover primer it's very
moisturizing and it's good for dry skin
I think it's the foil II skin too but
who knows and then just taking the MAGIX
foundation I'm pretty sure this is in
the shade 54 or any of the tiniest bit
of this but you guys know me you guys
know me I like full coverage like this
is full coverage you literally only need
three dots jazz was saying when I was
doing this she only uses three dots and
she thinks it's too much hon I use half
the bottle and I don't think it's enough
I love full coverage I love taking it on
because once you can still and contoured
and everything the faces looks
completely flawless in my opinion I just
took a little bit of mac's fix+ then and
to spray that on the face because this
foundation is quite thick I find it easy
to blend out when you spray like a
liquid or something on there and before
blending out with WT build anywhere
and then just going back to the mac
prolongwear concealer in the shade NC 15
and i'm going on her chin her nose her
forehead and i'm just blending that out
before i move on to underneath the eyes
because i know that under eyes can
crease quite easily with this concealer
until it set so i just do that first and
then i go straight ahead and start the
under eyes now a lot of people freak out
because i put on sorry much concealer
well I mean it looks good in my opinion
I love it and all my clients love it too
unless they specifically asked for like
not much concealer or not much
foundation or not much eyeshadow I just
go ahead and they just normally just
tell me to do exactly what I want so
yeah I'm just blending that out with the
damp Beauty Blender once again and as
you can see it's a very full coverage
it's kind of like a gel this concealer
which I really like then to bathe the
under eyes I'm just taking the ICMA no
color powder this has no flashback
apparently it does have flashback to
some people which is weird just make
sure when you use this product you knock
it off completely with a really dense
brush so there is nothing left behind
and I do like to go over with a little
bit of banana powder sometimes just to
make sure that there's no like white
cast left behind and the banana powder
turns to cover it going in with Jazz's
favorite powder that she swears by this
is the Australis fresh and flawless this
is in the shade medium tan jazz swears
by this uses on her clients and I also
swear by this I just think it's so good
and just because it's a drugstore
product it doesn't mean it's not good or
you can't use on clients like some
people might screw their nose up at it
if I use it on clients but honestly I
don't care because in my opinion I think
it's a great product and if it does the
job it does the job
moving on to bronzer I'm using like Matt
could give me Sun and I'm just bronzing
up her cheekbones with this big ass
brush when I started using this I'm - is
like you use this for bronze I'm like
yeah it's like the best I'll have a big
fluffy brush for bronzer because it
doesn't contour just like gets the whole
face but it doesn't leave any lines and
it just tends to airbrush everything in
my opinion then just taking the other
star see our Beverly Hills come to a kit
I'm taking the warm shade and the middle
shade which is like the gray tone one
and then the warm one and just
contouring her jaw line her cheekbones a
little bit on her forehead and then I
also take a little bit down both sides
of the nose I'm not contouring her nose
because jazz doesn't need it and I
really couldn't be bothered to be honest
so I'm just taking a little bit down the
side of her
nose and then moving back on to
underneath the eyes and then just taking
a little bit of the Inglot gel liner and
I'm just learning her waterline with
that some people hate getting this done
by other people which is understandable
cause it can be really uncomfortable but
I mean hmm whatever and then just taking
some more of those purple shades
basically I don't know what purple
shades I took I just kind of went from
darkest to lightest you know I found it
on braying that bottom underneath the
bottom I out like smoking it out if that
makes any sense I'm really tired so I'm
not making sense at all
sorry in advance and then I'm just
taking a little fluffy brending blend
brending see brending what the and
I just blended that out now I'm knocking
off that bake as I said earlier just
with a little bit of banana powder just
so there is no white flashback or white
cast cause people would say left over
just running that along her chin and her
Cupid's bow her nose a bra for lashes I
just use that Lily lashes I leave to
style down below and I'm just putting
these over her lash extensions it was
actually easier than I thought forever
lash extensions I've never really done
that before for her brows today I'm just
using the benefit browsing a brow kit
this was in the shade number three I'm
pretty sure and I'm not using the gel in
that I'm just using the powder as
Jasleen need the gel because she has her
eyebrows tattooed on
so I just followed the natural shape and
went for a little bit of under eye
mascara there with the Mac extended play
for highlighter today this is the new
anastasia beverly hills glory kit jazz
was nice enough to bring this along so
we got to try it out and my opinion on
it it's good but it's not that good okay
I feel like it's just an average you
know glow kit that they've bought out
before honestly I prefer that Oprah
highlighters over this but it's still
not that bad but it's not that great if
that makes sense sorry I'm just being
honest then I was putting it along the
Cupid's bow and her nose and then I'm
taking my favorite highlighter ever and
even she was shocked at this watch your
face ready three two one see what I mean
this highlighter is so pigmented it's
Oprah Beverly Hills it is so freaking
good everyone means it's my favorite
highlighter ever then just taking
Mac lip liner I'm not sure what shade
just was in but I'll leave it down below
I think it was spiced or well just
letting her lips with that and then I'm
going straight over with the over
liquid lipstick in the shade Deena and
just clapping that all over her lips and
then we went in with a gloss but I
forget what it was called I'm really
sorry about that I think it was just a
clear gloss and then just sending that
with the sale day setting spray
so this is the finished look I hope you
