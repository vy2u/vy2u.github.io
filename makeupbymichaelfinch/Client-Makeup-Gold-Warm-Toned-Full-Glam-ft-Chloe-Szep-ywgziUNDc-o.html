is going to get straight into it going
in with this touch or Jewish skin mr.
spritzing Chloe's face with that and
then we are moving straight on through
the tight shape tape concealer to use as
an eye base today now quickly I just
want to say that Chloe is my model for
today and Chloe does have a YouTube
channel as well and she also has
Instagram I will leave them all down
below so you guys can go and check out
her stunning videos and her stunning
Instagram photos so I'm just taking my
clean damp Beauty Blender and just
letting in that concealer and then
quickly setting it with just some RCM a
translucent powder just before it gets a
chance to crease just so we have a nice
smooth base for our shadows moving on to
eyeshadow today I'm going to use the
morphe 35o palette and I'm going to take
these two shades here and I'm just going
to start buffing that into her cruise to
make it look just absolutely stunning
guys I'm obsessed with this look so much
and it did take me a while to do so I
did speed quite a lot of it up but it's
just kind of better off that way I guess
rather than going on Vino a 30 minute
tutorial so I'm just taking a smaller
dense brush taking those two same colors
and putting that through her crease then
I'm just going to whip out the fruit of
beauty pilot and I'm just going to take
the shade portion of it to my favorite
eyeshadow color as bus and formula it is
amazing guys it's still amazing so I'm
just buffing that into the outer crease
as well I'm just going some light to
dark basically you guys know the drill
that's what I love to do so I'm just
using that small brush with henna and
putting that all throughout her crease I
think it looks so nice it makes the eyes
look so blue to scoid two subparts blue
eyes it just really complements the eye
color and this is just my overall
favorite look to do so as you can see
I'm just going back in with a little bit
more of those morphe orange eye shadows
just above our henna a little bit more
and I just love it now to darken that up
a little bit I'm just going to take
cocoa from the food of beauty palette
once again and I'm just going to put
that down a little bit lower than I did
with henna because you don't want to
lose
turn up in there so I'm just kind of
bringing it down below and lower each
how do I go the darker I get if that
makes any sense whatsoever so I'm just
blending over that just to make sure it
is all seamless and there are no harsh
lines or anything like that then what is
going to be moving into a black truffle
from the food of beauty palate this is
the most amazing black eyeshadow ever
not only the pigment but the formula of
it is just amazing like it's so
blendable and it just doesn't look
chunky ever I've never had a problem
with this Isis black eyeshadow but
eyeshadow sure to scare me so much but I
found the one that I love the most
so that I'm just going to take a little
bit more cocoa and just go over that
black eyeshadow just above out that
black to make sure it's completely
seamless you know what I'm like going
back in and out with colors it's just
the way I love it I think it just looks
oh it just complements the whole makeup
just absolutely stunning and there's be
indeed she had to make an appearance
remember taking the Too Faced shadow
insurance glitter glue I'm just going to
prep her eyes with that just as a small
brush so I'm focusing majority of the
glue in the middle of the eye lid and
then I'm kind of taking what's left on
the brush and kind of just dabbing it
around the edges do you know what I mean
so I'm just kind of making a line kind
of a line I don't know you guys get the
gist then I'm just taking the Mac gold
glitter and I'm just generously packing
that all over her lid and this is one of
my favorite glitter ever just look at
that are you serious
it looks stunning some of the surfaces
God whether it's so beautiful so I'm
just putting that on her other eye also
and now we are moving on to the gel
liner so it's going to do a wing on
Chloe today and to do that I use the
Mallory cosmetics black gel liner this
is so good because it's kind of got a
wet consistency so it's really good to
go over glitter or a pigment on your
eyelid rather than using the Inglot gel
liner or the Maybelline Maya I feel like
this is setup because it's more wet so
it does glide over and doesn't get all
chunky if you like use glitter often you
know what I mean by chunky not nice so
as you can see I'm just doing both of
Chloe's wings on her beautiful little
eye shadow glittery eyes and bring that
all the way across the top of her lash
line onto the inner corner
just to join everything after so there's
enough room for the lash to disappear
into so now I'm just taking a clean
makeup wipe and just wiping off all of
that glitter that's fallen on her face
now we're moving into primer this is the
Kat Von D primer and it is a good primer
I mean I can't really tell if primers
ever work so I swear I found out in
every single video it's so hard to tell
with primers work wonder I swear by as
professional because it literally does
blur the skin okay moving on to
foundation this is the aloe glass
foundation stick and Chloe is a friend
so she's not an actual client I wouldn't
actually use the direct stick on a
client ever I would scrape it off put on
a palette mix it up and put it straight
onto the skin but yeah so if a
foundation if you are using this on a
client I would recommend doing what I
just said but because Chloe is a friend
we don't really care about it do you
know what I mean like someone's going to
read me for that that I honestly don't
care because I've just done a little
disclaimer all right so save it in the
comment time so I'm just letting that up
with my a damper Beauty Blender making
sure that is all seamless and absolutely
stunning
moving up to concealer I'm just taking
the top shape type concealer and I'm
actually taking two shades so I put some
of that one down I'm like it's not gonna
be loud enough like I love a bright
highlight I don't know if Chloe does but
I do and I mean I'm in control here hon
so I took some more of the top shade
tape one of the latter shades I'll leave
them both down below you guys and I'm
just letting that out with my a damp
Beauty Blender just very good I'm like
obsessive this looks very much and
Chloe's got the most perfect face for
this look as ah so as you can see I'm
just doing underneath the eyes with that
same concealer again and then I'm just
going on with a little bit of lighter
concealer just to brighten that up to
diff I used up the lighter concealer all
the way across it would have been way
too bright so that's why I mix mature
together then I'm just taking my jet
beauty blender again and blending that
all up
as you can see here Dom just speeding up
the process a little bit because he
wants to sit through 20 minutes of
blending concealer thank you am i right
though am i right though
by the way excuse my fake tan on my arm
it looks so horrendous that would like
the third day of having it anyway moving
on to baking we are taking the trophy no
toilet powder by our CMA so good
actually
try to buy the I see a nice foundation
the other day because apparently it's
really good but I didn't get around to
it so I need to get that just get my
hands on that because if this part is so
good the foundation has to be just as
good so I'm also baking her nose and I
think she was a bit shocked with how
much powder I was putting on but that's
okay then just setting the rest of her
foundation with the Australian flawless
skin darkest Brown I think it was and
just dusting off the nose back there and
we're leaving the I bake on for a while
until we do underneath the lash line so
so the waterline and underneath the lash
line I'm just taking the molar cosmetics
black gel liner popping that in there
and then I'm going to be taking a little
tiny brush and smoking that down with
the black truffle from the food of
beauty palate now this is a bit of a
process because it's constantly going
back in with shadows letting going out
going in blending that one hour and I
did go down super super super low with
this shadow so it's super duper duper
smoking but I love to look in the end I
think it looks so so nice just dramatic
club'
luck rolling out my card I just love it
as you can see I'm just going back in
with Coco black truffle henna I just go
back in in and out with them until it
just looks good then I'm just dusting
off the under-eye baked and then I'm
just gonna grating with a little bit
more of henna and just blend all of that
out to make sure it is so blended and
super SuperDuper smoky and then I'm just
going to take that orange shade from the
morphe 35o palette and just blend it out
and down even more look at that look how
smoky it is I love it now we're doing a
little bit of a scar that was causing
scar ahem so I'm not using a disposable
mascara one please don't read me and
full lashes we are using really lashes
Miami these are my favorite lashes ever
I do have a discount code
down below you guys and on the screen
right now if you are interested so I'm
just cutting those lashes putting some
glue on and I did use the Tarte eyelash
glue it's quite good it takes a long
time to dry but it's very very strong
yes Chloe you better work now taking the
a Marc Jacobs Omega bronzer in tantric I
think it is I'm just brushing up her
face don't know why I bronze first when
I figured out the other day the
contouring before bronzing doesn't let
it go muddy but honestly the Marc Jacobs
remarkable bronzer and the combination
of that with hawler benefit is seriously
stunning thank you it's just so nice so
I'm just contouring her face with the
hoola bronzer koi doesn't need much
contouring she has such a nice defined
face cheekbones jawline everything like
that so a little bit of contouring
moving on to the brows we are using the
Tarte waterproof gel pomade I guess this
is in ash blonde I think it was and I'm
just putting a little bit through her
brows we're not making them true
instagrammy we're just kind of filling
in the natural shape because she already
has a really nice natural shape on her
eyebrows so I'm just filling that in as
you can see right here down moving on to
blush we are taking the sweet peach
blush from true face it's so so pretty I
forget the shade of this one but I will
leave it down below I'm just popping a
little tiny bit on Chloe's cheeks just
to bring back a little color to the face
rather than just having bronzer and I
think it looks so good like just that
little touch of color amazing spritzing
the face with a little bit of six
clusters to prep so the highlighter this
is the tarte exposed highlight oh my god
this is amazing if you are looking for
like a new highlighter or something like
that this is so pretty just wait until
you see until she turns to the side you
guys will look at that like are you
kidding me and that's only a tiny bit of
highlighter that I put on like you could
pack that on and really intensify and it
really suits Chloe's skin tone as well
it just - everything about this whole
look everything just came together in
the end and I'm literally so happy with
this look I'm obsessed with it it's one
of my favorite client tutorials I've
ever done I'm just taking a little bit
of that also under the brow bone and
should make that pop a little bit more
and I think I did sleep a little bit
on the inner corners as well yes I did I
was correct
thank you for lips today we are using
jeffree star cosmetics celebrity skin
and I'm just applying that around the
outer edges of her lips I actually saw a
mixed lipstick nick and Geoffrey do this
the other day she put celebrity skin
around the edge and then I'm nude in the
middle with a little brush like a lot of
people do that at the moment but not
with a brush and I feel like with a
brush you can get more in there and it's
like more to find it's just like more
stunning so I'm just taking I'm nude by
Geoffrey stop popping that in the center
and that is pretty much it this is the
finished look I hope you guys really
enjoyed this video if you did don't
forget to give me a massive thumbs up I
love you guys so much and I will see you
all in my next video bye see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
