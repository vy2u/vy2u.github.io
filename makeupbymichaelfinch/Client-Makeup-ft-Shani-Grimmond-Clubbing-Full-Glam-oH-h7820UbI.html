let's just get straight into it first of
all under spritzing the face with some
mac fix+ just to hydrate etc now I'm
moving on to the eye base and just for
that I'm going to be using the Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot and this is absolutely
stunning it is quite dry so you have to
work with it fast but I did go ahead and
blend it out with a Beauty Blender next
I'm taking the tarte contour palette and
I'm just setting her eyes with the
banana II sort of shade in that palette
just so the shadows blend seamlessly and
then taking the makeup geek shadow in
Peach Smoothie as a transition color and
as you can see I'm packing quite a lot
of this on and I will be blending it
quite fly out as I will not be cleaning
this up I'm just going to leave it like
blended then I'm going to be taking Coco
bear and defining that a little bit more
and starting to get a bit of shape up in
that crease area
as you can see I've just taken the
smaller brush and I'm just defining that
a little bit more it's kind of like a
smokey eye so it's all about going in
and our back with shadows like different
colors like going back and forth back
and forth then I'm taking makeup geek
corrupt I believe it's called and I'm
packing that over the entire lid just to
make it very black and smoking which is
what we want and then just taking the
makeup primer and just priming her face
with that as so and blending it in with
just a regular foundation bra
now for foundation today I'm taking the
Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation now I
am matching her tan to her face so it is
darker obviously there I want to have a
different color so I'm just blending
that out and I am using a stippling
brush rather than a Beauty Blender
because this foundation is quite thick
it's very full coverage and I probably
did use a little bit too much but I mean
it blends out in the end and it looks
really good so I can deal with that
and then just taking a bit more fix+
just to spritz on her faces before I do
go into the beauty blender and blend
that out just to moisture up a little
bit to salt does blend a little bit
better now I'm just going to be
concealing with the Born This Way
two-faced
concealer and applying that under her
eyes on her nose bridge her forehead her
chin and a little bit on her Cupid's bow
just to brighten up everything just
because the foundation is quite dark
just taking my Beauty Blender my damp
Beauty Blender my stay ad and I'm just
blending that out until it's all blended
now to bake today I'm taking the Laura
Mercier translucent powder and I'm going
to be taking my damp Beauty Blender
sponge that I was using before and I'm
baking underneath her eyes and her nose
with that just to assure that we don't
get any fallout and this will soak into
the skin and make the makeup last longer
as well
and then just taking somewhere that
laura mercier translucent powder and
just dusting the rest of her face with
that just to set the rest of the
foundation now as you can see I've
already gone on with bronzing powder
this is the Mac and give me Sun and I'm
using quite a generous amount at this
around the corners of her face and where
I will be contouring to put down a
powder just before I do go on the
contour just sort of blends better you
know the more powder the easier it is to
blend to contour I'm just using my Tarte
palette
now as you can see I'm just dusting off
some of that bake off her forehead and
her nose just to prepare because I am
getting ready to contour our nose now to
contour today on the nose we are using
the Macky give me some bronzer and the
Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit in
light
now full winged liner I'm taking the
Maybelline studio gel liner and every
time I have a client I always ask them
to open so I can plan out the wing
because if they close you're not really
matching it up with their actual eye
shape and it needs to suit the eye shape
so I just are shining to open and then
close I'll join the wing up and kind of
make it a little bit thicker just so it
does through her eye shape and it's not
true up in her hooded little eye then
I'm taking the benefit magic Inc liquid
liner and just sharpening up that wing a
touch more now as you can see I'm
actually just going in with the
Maybelline studio gel liner again on her
waterline and I'm going to be smudging
that down with some cocoa bear and also
some corrupt eyeshadow from makeup geek
for mascara today I'm taking the Mac
extended play gigablack lash mascara and
I actually just am using her mascara
because it is hers hence why I didn't
use disposables and same goes for lip
things today for eyebrows I'm just using
the UH Nastasia powder in blonde a
medium brown or blue short was all
products will be listed down below guys
and I'm just filling in her natural brow
shape with an angled brush I'm just
going to apply some bold things and I
didn't film that but you guys know how
to put lashes on quite easy then taking
the Too Faced glitter glue I'm just
going to be applying that on the inner
corner of her eye to prepare for an
inner corner highlight and to do that
I'm taking Inglot
shimmery sparkling dust and just
applying that on the inner corners of
her eyes to give a severe pop of shimmer
now to highlight I'm taking the violet
Voss Pro palette and just applying
highlighter onto the high points of her
face
I'm also just applying that a little bit
along the bridge of her nose and also
the tip of her nose just to make that
pop a little bit more for lips today I'm
taking jeffree star cosmetics and
mannequin and just applying that to her
lip making a book the really amazing I'm
also just going to be taking a little
bit more highlight and just applying
that underneath her brow bone to make
that pot a little bit more cheery so
that's pretty much the end of the video
