hello everyone welcome back to my
channel so today I'm gonna be doing like
a cranberry kapa sort of strike yeah and
it's gonna be Gorge as you can see my
skin still kind of bad but we'll get
used to it so let's start off with the
eyes first of all I'm taking the MacOS
trio big prolongwear concealer and I'm
just gonna be using that as a base on my
eyelids today and then I'm gonna be
going in with a fluffy blending brush
and just blending all that concealer out
making sure that there are no creases or
harsh lines then before that gets a
chance to crease I'm just gonna set that
with the Australis fresh and flawless
now first color going in today is called
razzle berry by makeup geek and I
decided to put some tape there because I
wanted to have you know that effect as
you can see I'm not cutting out much I'm
just like speeding it all up so you can
see the process of the blending and how
much blending actually goes into it this
look is all about blending okay
blend blend blend just blend
your life way okay there's no such
single too much wedding well there is
but doesn't
now second color I'm going into a called
bitten this is also from my cookie all
the shadows I'm using her from makeup
geek now as I was doing this tutorial I
was like oh my god this looks like the
BTW killer Jeffrey stop palette tutorial
that I did a few videos ago I bought you
know what at all this is changing it off
a little bit condos not really anyway
I'm just gonna be deepening up my crease
with that and then I'll be going back
into razzle berry and blending that over
and kind of just blending it all
together it's about blending
now the next color I'm going into is
corrupt for makeup date this is a black
obviously and this is gonna completely
define the hull I look now as you can
see I'm going very very sparingly and
I'm not bringing that up Pass bitten
because I don't really want to lose that
as such and color coded eyes I am
bringing it all the way across just so
you can see when my eyes are open and
also closed
now the next climb going into is sand
dollar this is also from makeup geek and
I'm just gonna be using that as my brow
bone highlight and I reckon it looks
really good
okay sorry next we're moving on to the
lid and we're gonna be using
flamethrower from Mac just lay down as
like a base and I'm gonna be spraying a
little bit of fix+ on that just so the
pigment is a little bit better okay so
I'm just packing that onto my entire
eyelids as you can see here and gorgiano
from orange now I'm gonna be going on to
Mac copper sparkle this is a Pigman I'm
just packing that onto my entire eyelid
as well now moving on to my wings I'm
using the Maybelline studio gel liner
and it's so hard to do my wings on
camera in frame like every single time I
fail like look at me like struggling
like popping up and down like hi how are
you but it's not working
see I'm basically just doing a wing
using my favourite winged eyeliner brush
this is the zoeva wings liner brush for
a good and yeah oh my god the
satisfaction check it out I decided to
show you both sides
just because peel porn is good now I am
just a pill porn what the now I'm
just cleaning that up with my makeup I
actually make my wing a little bit
longer as you can please
now we're gonna be doing under the eyes
because are doing skin last so basically
is doing exactly the same one I do on
top of the eye but under the eye so they
can seal that and then I go in with a
bit of actually I'm not gonna primary
Razzleberry hands we're going in with a
gel liner we're going starting with that
gel liner on my waterline and kind of
smudging it down a little bit then we'll
be going in with bisson yes I would
right see it and we're just gonna be
smoking that down a little bit old bar
just just make out that lower lash line
and then we'll be going in with a razzle
berry just to blend that out a little
bit if you know what I mean these
voiceovers are kind of hard to keep up
with sometimes it just depends
- car today I'm using Mac extended play
gigablack lash mascara and you guys
don't need to know half of the star or I
mean
lashes I'm using there's a lot more
linked mink lashes I using in my last
video I think all the video before that
I just love them like I just I'm
obsessed
and if you love it when you can put a
lash on sorry easily oh yes say look at
me just checking it out cuz I'm so proud
so now for my skin today I'm gonna be
using the LA girl primer which I kinda
really am loving lately it's kind of
bomb as
so then foundation I'm not gonna be
taking this on completely this is the
Arbonne one I'm not gonna be taking this
on completely because we are doing some
cream contouring and highlighting and
that does have good coverage as well so
I'm not taking myself up too much
because the more product the worse
sometimes in most cases it's good so I'm
just blending that out with my Beauty
Blender then I'm gonna be going in with
my cream contour kit business from
iconic London I'm not showing you guys
everything because I am gonna be doing a
separate video on cream contouring and
powder contouring in general so we'll
get more into detail when I end up doing
that but yeah I'm just blending all that
out with my Beauty Blender
to set and bake my Andres musing the
ICMA no color powder which is my new
favorite powder still love my ass fun as
I said but you know now I'm setting the
rest of my foundation with the Australis
fresh and a flawless pressed powder as
you can see here gives a good coverage
and it's also very cheap so get
onto it sorry now I'm moving on to
bronzer and I'm using Mac you give me
Sun just on this biggest brush this
is the best way to apply your bronzer
just a massive big loose fluffy brush I
love it and then just contouring my face
a little bit with the ABH contour kit in
light just carving out my cheekbones a
little bit not going too intense that I
just cuz I wasn't in the mood but I'm
you know it's a little bit stuffing
something and then I am just contouring
my big ole jolly nose down because I
really need to do that Conor was talking
to get a nose job
oh my god come on being a girl
on a stop now to highlight under my eyes
I'm using that Ofra banana powder and
I'm also knocking away that BAE kids so
we doing tune of times though you know
he's saving time here David I'm but I'm
just putting that down the bridge of my
nose my chin Cupid's bow and on my
forehead overblown just because I feel
like this powder brightens up the area
completely now for my blush it's a
makeup geek blush in romance I love this
blush and I'm just going absolutely ham
with the blush as you can say like
normally I'm not a very big blush we're
off now let's talk about this
highlighter for a second this is a
Brigitte from draw cosmetics fine
literally obsessed I give such a nice
glow I don't know what it is like can't
you just see it it's just so like lively
and pretty
for my lip color today I'm using Jerrod
cosmetics share liquid lipstick and this
formula of liquid lipstick is amazing I
think it's gonna be my new favorite I'm
not sure but I feel like it's going to
be I just love it like look at it and
the color I'm living I'm absolutely
living so yeah I'm just putting that on
my link being re just making a big
striking line underneath that's how I do
my lips with a liquid lipstick that's so
easy and you know
now to set my face I'm just using the LA
girl setting spray and also a little bit
of narcotics plus just to make my
highlight pop a little bit more anyway
guys that is the end of this tutorial I
hope you all enjoyed it um and if you
