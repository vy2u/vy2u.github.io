channel so today I'm gonna be doing a
seductive date night glam makeup so
today as you guys can tell from the
title I'm gonna be doing a date night
makeup a tutorial sorry if you guys are
going out on a date anytime soon I'm
gonna do something like a little
seductive a little something that's just
gonna you know make whoever you're going
on a date we want to look into your eyes
and not be able to see them because it's
gonna be so smoky over-the-top
dramatic as you can tell I've already
got my brows filled in as per usual
without any further ado let's get
straight into this video
okay so as per usual I'm just gonna be
starting off with my eyes as per use for
that I'm gonna be taking a little bit of
the top shape this is in the shade tan
and I want to do it a little bit of a
warmer color because I'm gonna be
working with warmer colors today now
before I get fully into it I just wanted
to let you guys know that I am actually
working with Mac on this video so shout
out to Mac for working with me on this
video I have loved Mac for so many years
and I think it's lit when you get to
work with brands that you actually
really do like I feel like Mac is like
an OG makeup brand like Mac is like Mac
you know what I mean so I'm just
concealing under my brow my brows are
looking real bitchy tonight you know I
mean like real bitchy like oh so much
sass in the brows like they're speaking
words right now there's literally
speaking words I'm also just gonna take
this concealer hold down on to my lid to
prep my eyes as a nice base for this now
I got my eyebrows waxed the other day
and I have a little bump right there and
it's really annoying me but we're just
gonna deal with that my acne is starting
to clear up now which is absolutely
let's okay I'm just gonna take this a
little blending brush and just blend out
the concealer I'm just gonna take a
little bit of translucent powder and
just set ours with that concealer so
it's nice and set prepped ready for the
shadow doll now the palette I'm gonna be
using today is called the mischief minx
palette from Mac sorry this palette is
extremely versatile so I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna go image like these colors no
I'm just gonna kind of go with it and
just like do something really like stood
octave and like like look into my eyes
but you can't see them chewed on I mean
now I think I'm gonna go in with a
little bit of sticky tape for this eye
look cuz I want it to be like really
sure domed you know what I mean first
shade I'm gonna go in with is this like
pinky sort of shade you guys are I'm
really bad at explaining colors all
right I'm just gonna buff this through
my crease and I'm gonna kind of use this
as like a transition sort of card you
know what I'm saying I want to keep it
quiet lower though because I want it to
kind of be like cat eye but who knows
with me and could just all go up
creek and I could have literally the
most intense
eyes but I kind of know what look I want
to do and as you can probably tell these
are super super pigmented and blender
war and I'm just bringing that down on
to making a corner now there's also a
new palette coming out with mark it's
actually available today it's called the
risk-taker it's part of the girls
collection along with the mischief minx
and that'll be available exclusively
jamya as of today so if you want to go
check it out and suss it out go for go
up top now the next shade I'm gonna take
is like this gray Coltrane I'm just
gonna mix in a little bit of that
black-ish navy color with it and this
I'm gonna start using this to define the
out of being so I'm just gonna whack it
on like that and we're gonna worry about
blending off with you know bring it off
the side of the tape oh my gosh this
black is sorry black okay this is the
vibe I'm getting see how it's kind of
like winged out on the edge cuz my look
is very life do not I mean like it's
very like bitchy and like caked on
pallete speaking to me it's speaking to
me and I'm living loving breathing for
it so this now I'm just gonna take a
little bit more of that whole turn
greyish sort of color and I'm gonna see
if I can blend out this black really
really lightly this is my little brush
I'm gonna bring that all the way into my
inner corner now what i'm gonna do is
i'm gonna go back in with that burgundy
color that I use as my transition I add
and I'm gonna blend over the black and
the core tone gray so all kind of comes
together now of course this look is
surgeon my take but that's what you want
to take that you want to impress your
day don't you ever let anybody tell you
that you're wearing too much makeup
there is no such thing as too much
makeup you wear as much or as little as
you want so if you don't want to wear
makeup don't wear it if you want to wear
a lot of makeup like me oh I forgot dope
now I'm just gonna take this black color
again and I'm just using this mirror
because I needs to stay up a little bit
closer that's such a good thing about
like I show you parts with Americas you
can really get up in there do you know
what I mean and I'm just adding on a
little bit more black mmm that's very
bitchy I love that now of course you
don't want to scare them off too much so
you need to add a little bit of shimmer
or something to the lid so it's gonna
take a little bit of fixed class on my
brush and then I'm just gonna dip it
straight into this really like a
beautiful shimmery shade and I'm just
gonna pop this all over my lid oh my god
okay so that's just added a really nice
pop of shimmer I'm just slightly
blending around the edges just to make
sure there's no harsh lines and just
touching up that black on the outer
corner what I'm also gonna do is I'm
just going to take a angled brush and
I'm just gonna dip into that black
shadow I don't want to do anything like
too intense on my waterline so I'm just
gonna press in the black shadow chew my
lash line okay so now that my eyes are
all done I'm just gonna be moving on to
mascara and for that I'm taking the bolt
and bad lashes from Mac on before we pop
on falsies I don't know how some people
do like put lashes on first and then J
mascara just like does anybody do that
cuz I always have to put mascara on
first and fully caught them so then when
the lashes go on you can like blend them
together even more does that make sense
okay so now for my lashes I'm gonna be
taking these ones from morphe these are
in the style
Romancing oh my god how relevant they're
like very like in-your-face so I'm just
gonna pop these on very dramatic very
over-the-top very me love that don't
perfect okay so now that the tops of my
eyes are all done let's move on to the
face so I for the face today I'm gonna
be using the mineral primer from
hourglass I want my skin to look really
like flawless
this primer confuses the shadow because
it's literally purple like what's the
guy
it's literally purple now for my
foundation I'm gonna be trying out this
new one this is from a Charlotte Tilbury
Tilbury Tilbury Tilbury Charlotte can
tinkle Matsuo berries any day hey this
is the Hollywood flawless filter for a
superstar youth glory this is in the
shade medium number 4 sorry I'm pretty
sure this was like close to my shade I
was sent this one in pyaar so I didn't
get to choose my shade I guess they kind
of idli just like randomly picked it
okay now I need full coverage for this
glam bag
and this is not giving me full coverage
vibes so I think I'm gonna go in with a
different foundation instead I'm going
to be taking my nas long wet natural
radiant low my foundation is in the
shade at UConn I'm gonna go in with
kissing step because Justin never lets
me down
now if you want full coverage but like
light feels like it's very light
okay I look crazy hang on just gonna run
over the tops of my brows and just
conceal them with this foundation this
is all blended out nicely now I know I'm
looking absolutely crazy sir I'm gonna
whack on some a concealer so my
concealer today I'm just gonna be taking
D a color pop no filter concealer in the
shade sand number five and I'm just
gonna use this to highlight the center
of my face and I'm just gonna chuck on a
little bit under my eyes dad we gonna do
what laughs dear and I'm just gonna take
a little bit of concealer it's gonna
zoom you guys in that's better it's
gonna take a little bit of the concealer
and clean up the wing okay now that's
ready to go I'm going to take my damp
Beauty Blender and oh my god I actually
look insane cuz I am not actually gonna
insane I'm actually a really nice person
if you're nice to me okay I'm just gonna
speed this pot up and blend this out
because you guys assume you enjoy it
literally a million times
now to bank and set everything into
place I'm sorry taking the prettiest fun
powder I haven't used this in such a
long time oh you know why because the
packaging is absolutely versat it's
literally going ever and it smells like
dead cow but in saying that it's never
let me down ever absolutely everything
and most of us gonna set my nerves whoo
yo just filming why what's wrong now I'm
gonna take more of that patter and just
set the rest of my face or everything
set into place and not gonna move we're
gonna do lap Diaz all right so just
going in and contouring I'm just taking
some of the Kevyn Aucoin a medium
sculpting powder
I've been hot obsessed with this lately
cuz it like gives a natural look like it
gives like a NASA shot but when you got
over with bronzer everything changes
obviously contouring this out of my
forehead now know me when you go on
dates it's kind of like dark in the room
sorry you can take the on like if
you're not gonna be in summer cause if
you're in some that would just sort of
makeup on be careful that's all I can
say so this is nighttime date glam you
vibe do not forget to contour the
out of your jaw line I feel like when
it's nighttime you can wear so much more
makeup than you were during the day even
though I don't really change it but you
know for any normal person now I'm just
gonna snatch my nose a little bit bring
this back because I'll be looking like
Voldemort and I'm gonna bring it up into
my brow okay so to finish off this eye
look I'm gonna go back in with that
burgundy color as my transition
then I'm gonna take the black shade out
of the palette my wing with underneath
my I saw all kind of clothes do you know
what I mean I'm just gonna more or less
blend the two of them together this is
looking super bitchy and super smoky and
I'm absolutely living for it okay so
that's that part done now just so you
don't scare your date off too much I'm
just gonna put a little bit of the Tarte
in a rim liner on my waterline just to
be not too scary do you know what I mean
now for my bottom lashes I'm swimming
taking my very loved Mac extended play
gigablack lash mascara the best mascara
especially for your bottom lashes and I
also like to bend I bent the one
permanently because you can really get
up in there now to bronze up my face a
little bit today I'm gonna be taking the
Mac mineralized skinfinish in a global
glow and I'm just gonna use this to
bronze up my face such a nice bronzer
color
oh I've been loving like really heavy
contours and like a bronzer lately like
in the designer hole that I uploaded a
lot of people will comment in saying
that um I look really like slim have me
guard the gym lately it's just the power
of contouring sis sorry I'll take that
as a compliment or I'll take it I'm just
gonna run a little bit now a little
trick if the other guards tree overboard
with your nose contour like I have today
for example just take a foundation
powder and just run her over it with
that and it will completely lighten it
up and make it look more natural ish see
how that's just lighten that up
completely for a little bit of blush
rooms and we're taking the UH Nastasia
Beverly Hills bronzer in the shade 20
sweep it onto my cheeks I brought this
as a bronzer I've mentioned it in a few
videos before but I brought this as a
bronzer but it's more of a blush color
for me so I like to just use it as a
blush and just kind of give some color
back to my face now moving on to
highlighter I'm gonna be taking the
palette that I've been using this whole
time and I'm gonna be taking the
highlighting
out of it I'm gonna garden with my
anastacio a 23 brush it's going to dip
in a lightly I'm just gonna be popping
this on my cheek just gonna spray my
brush with a little bit of fix+ so I can
get it a little bit more intense okay
such a gorge color it's gonna be puffing
a little bit on my nerves bridge and the
two miners and obviously my cupids by
now for my inner corner highlight I'm
actually gonna be taking the gold shade
out of this this one here that I didn't
use before and I'm gonna put this on my
inner corner to brighten it ah oh yeah
that's nice now for my lip color I'm
just gonna be taking a burnt spice from
Mac and I'm just going to stir it up on
in here okay so I'm pretty sure we are
almost done I'm just gonna set with a
little bit of these slay old a setting
spray from Girard
