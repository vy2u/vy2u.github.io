today I'm gonna be doing a drugstore
makeup tutorial it's actually gonna be
kind of like a first impressions because
I've got a bunch of drugstore makeup
sitting in front of me and I want to
give you guys my first impressions on
them
I've got brands from Milani went wild
I've got one color pop thing la girl and
why see L'Oreal etc etc etc I really
enjoy doing these videos because it
gives you guys a first impression of
what I think on the product and I feel
like first impressions really count
especially when it comes to makeup
because if you don't like it the first
time you use it there's a 99% chance you
I'm not gonna use it again so without
any further ado let's get into it
so as you can already say I've done my
brows because well you need to shut the
 up and go on silent because I'm
already over it BJ Vinny's name hasn't
come out for a while has it been well
Ben bTW sorry for my concealer today I'm
gonna be trying out this Milani retouch
and arrays light lifting concealer so
I'm gonna be using this as my eye base
today this is in the shade fair so it's
like a little squidgy thing and it
squeezes out I'm just gonna pop a little
bit on the back of my hard so I'm just
gonna start by concealing under my brow
so far so good with this concealer I'm
gonna drag that down all the way onto my
lid because I'm gonna be using this as a
base today you guys know I love to use
concealers for my eye base rather than
an actual eye primer okay bring this all
across I'm just gonna keep blending this
out when it comes to foundation powder I
don't have anyone to try at the murmur
so I'm gonna take a little bit of my
Rimmel stay matte powder and I'm just
gonna lightly tap over that concealer
just to set it into place now for
eyeshadow today I have this palette from
la girl this one right here it's got
some pretty just like nude and shimmery
shades in here so it's not gonna be you
can go anywhere cuz you're a sponge tip
applicator yeah so this is what I'm
gonna be working with today alright so
I'm going to take this light pink shade
down the bottom here I'm just gonna kind
of pop this in my crease just so we have
something going on in there oh yeah I'm
just gonna lightly be blending that up
kind of like a cute little pink moment
so this eye shadow so far has blended
really nicely it's buildable and it's
pigmented I wonder how they came out
with the name la girl anyway what am I
not New York City gohan no I like LA
better than New York that's a question
that I want to ask you guys do you guys
prefer LA or do you prefer New York like
if you've been and also why leave me let
me know down below in the comments
personally I prefer LA it's much more
like my lifestyle I love like I don't
know it's just more like Hollywood and
stuff like that I really like it to be
honest I like LA is a place better more
but New York has a wave
shopping the shopping in New York is
like out of this world like Soho and
everything like that oh my god alright
so after I've blended that out and I'm
just gonna take a different brush and
I'm gonna go in with this darker shade
here and see if I can get a little bit
more something something going on this
out of V here I'm actually really
impressed with the blend ability and the
pigmentation of these shadows I feel
like I need to go out and buy some more
of these pallets to see how they go cuz
so far I'm really liking this finally
I'm just gonna dip into this pink
shimmery shade here and I'm just gonna
pop this all over my eyelid okay I'm
actually just gonna take a little bit of
things plus with that because this is
this is regular to take fix+ with your
shimmery eyeshadows almost every single
shimmery eyeshadow I use I use six plus
you have two there we go now I'd talk in
okay so it's just a little bit of wash
of color all over my lid I was gonna
take a little bit more of that darker
shade that I use and just kind of make
sure everything is blended I was gonna
clean up underneath my eyes a lot to do
as much fallout but just my back like
that
now do you have this glitter here from
wet-and-wild that I really want to try
it was literally like a dollar or
something in CVS I got it when I was in
America it's in the shade brass brass
slash Latour lateen if I could
open it with these acrylics oh my god
there we go got him open now I'm not
sure how this is gonna work it could be
like a Vaseline based but I'm just gonna
take my brush and then pop it on my lid
oh yeah that works okay so this is
definitely Vaseline based so I feel like
if I put too much on it's gonna
with my eyeshadow I probably would not
use this again there as it is really
sticky maybe I might channel my inner
lily Brown and do a little bit of this
on my inner corners for mascara today
guys I'm gonna be testing out this one
here I've got from Rimmel this is a new
one wonderfully real mascara nice pink
tube let's give this a whirl
oh wow this is a good mascara it
literally gets in every single bit and
this little tip that you've got here
allows you to get right into your inner
corner on your eye all right guys so for
my lashes I'm gonna be trying out these
Ardell double upper lashes that is what
they look like up close okay so my
lashes are now on I just use the House
of lashes clear lash glue favorite lash
glue ever I know it's not drugstore but
it's a bit of glue who's gonna hurt now
moving on to my favorite part which is
my head I'm gonna be taking the
Milani prime light face primer strobing
and pore-minimizing packaging is on
fleek it's a little bit holographic do
you know what I mean
I love that so I'm just gonna pop this
like yes just gonna pop this all over my
skin as I would like any other primer it
does give you skin a bit of like a glow
but not as intense as I'm like back a
back light or the back strobe cream but
that's all good okay guys for a
foundation I'm gonna be trying out the
infallible Pro glow foundation now if
you've been watching a few of my videos
lately you would know that I found a
newfound hate for the ilaria pore glow
concealer it's a bit of a tongue twister
only because it does burn your under
eyes when you use it and it's got like
weird chemicals in it that like stings
your eyes and make some water I don't
know sir hope it doesn't do the same oh
that was product oh my god I just ate
that day shed ah-ah
see ya so I'm just gonna squirt a little
bit of this onto the back of my hand oh
it's very runny could be good could be
bad how long it's gonna take a
foundation brush and I'm just gonna drop
this all over my skin and then I'm gonna
go in with my Bodi blender and blend it
out keep talking don't forget these ears
got to paint them so they're not hot
pink for everyone to see you know this
Beauty Blender is literally it's
like on an angle it's like a bent dick
and then we've got some black
happening on this side which is stained
I don't know how that happened but it's
daytime we're just gonna go with it
alright sorry I'm just gonna take my
Beauty Blender and start blending this
found I saw into muskie
coverage wise it's good nursing under my
eyes or anything so there must be a
different formula to the concealer and
the foundation thank for that this
foundation has blended out really well
so far I'm just gonna do my big old
jolly off forehead okay so that
foundation blended out
super nicely a really nice coverage it's
a bit glowy and it's not patchy which is
the best okay so moving on to some cream
contouring I'm just gonna take this
stick here that I've got from Milani
it's got a highlight slide and it's got
a contour side so I'm gonna take the
contour side and I'm just yeah it's very
cool try I'm just gonna go with that and
blend that out
okay I'm gonna blend this out oh no hmm
okay so that is pretty much just a
really great own and it blended into
nothing so do you think I'm gonna use
that across across the rest of my face
today hon I'm just gonna leave that be
actually why not let's just do this side
and just see if anything changes and
mysteriously it's so cool trying this
stick I think there's different shades
of it yeah there is but this is for fair
light skin so it should be good for me I
really don't like it it kind of just
turns into like an ashy like gray colour
what I'm gonna use to try to cream
contour instead is this wet-and-wild
concealer this is the darkest shade that
I could find it's in the shade dark
cocoa this is the photo focus concealer
just gonna dab a little bit there and
then I'm just going to see how this
blends out okay that's a bit better than
the Milani one it's not very pigmented
but it's bit of a bronzed glow something
to do under my jaw line as well blend
this down and out and I'm also just
gonna do a little bit down the sides of
my nose and of course on my forehead all
right guys now going back in with that
Milani concealer that I used a little
bit earlier just gonna highlight that
first and then I'm just gonna blend it
out I was like to do my t-zone first
blend that out and then do my under eyes
so I can bake everything at the same
time and powder doesn't get mixed up
with liquid yeah
and now I go in on my under eyes with
this Milani concealer I'm keen to see
how this is gonna work with my under
eyes okay let's pull in this out oh yeah
not bad
this is the lightest color of the
concealer that they have in the Milani
one I wish there was one that was a bit
lighter now unfortunately I do not have
a new drugstore powder to try out so I'm
just gonna be going in with my
Maybelline fit me because it is my
favorite as of late and I'm just gonna
go straight in and bake my under eyes I
love this powder so much I'm just gonna
bake over my nose a bit too because I
always do that now to set the rest of my
foundation on is gonna be taking the
infallible Pro matte foundation powder
now I have used this before too but I
mean you know it's gonna run over my
face just set all my foundation in place
or my contouring all that you know
the wet and world concealer didn't
really do that much at all but whatever
now I'm gonna try contouring it with
this color pot palette here I know this
isn't drugstore it's affordable though
but it's the only thing that you know is
in this video anyway I'm gonna be trying
to contour up with this baby right here
I don't know how the shade is gonna go
because it does look quite warm toned
and I am NOT tanned but I'm just gonna
go in and begin to kind of contour I
guess so I'm just gonna contour my
forehead the shifting about having blond
hair as soon as you get makeup product
in here it turns yellow I mean it
happens though it's probably a little
bit too orange for my skintone at the
moment but I mean I'm not complaining
cuz I love a good orange glow when I am
knocked and as well as being tan so rock
on hon I'm also just gonna take a little
bit of that contouring powder and just
kind of make my nerves a little bit slim
I will try sir
Wow fully I don't know if you guys
caught that but I just jabbed my
eye out no worries okay now that I've
gone through it a little bit I'm just
gonna take this NYC bronzing a face
powder I picked this up and I think it
was CVS yeah I think it was CVS and some
take a larger bronzing brush and just
add some more orange nurse nice thumbs
up this forehead now for my blush today
I'm just gonna be taking this wet and
wild blush in the shade at mellow wine
just to give my cheeks a little bit of
color see how this goes
no it's just a flush of cola ha not too
much I'm on mellow wine mellow wine is
that what it's called mellow wine mellow
asshole bitch and now for my highlighter
I'm exceptionally excited to try this
out this is from makeup revolution
London this is the vivid abates
highlighter in the shade radiant light
so let's give this a whirl I know some
of you from London because this is the
drugstore London makeup brand I'm 99%
sure wait I need to dust off this bake
first what am i doing okay oh it's just
beautiful this powder just stunning
right so I'm going to take my trusty
little highlighting brush here and I'm
just gonna dip into this oh wow I didn't
spray my face I didn't spray my brush
come on makeup revolution yes that's a
gorgeous glow like I'm just gonna go oh
add some more my nose bridge a little
bit yeah oh okay and then I'm just gonna
pop a little bit more of this pink
shadow Oh straight under their Sun

then just a little bit more at that
darker color Wow

just gonna chuck on a little bit of a
bottom mascara hmm and now for my lips

covergirl and melting pout liquid
lipstick this is in the shade
105 okay so we are pretty much done and
unfortunately I do not have a setting
spray to set my face with so we're just
gonna leave it at this today so this is
the end of today's video I really hope
you guys enjoyed it and you liked this
look I'm really impressed with it almost
everything I use the least impressed
thing I am impressed about is the
glitter because the Vaseline is like
transferred and taken off all my
eyeshadow but we're just gonna ignore
that because everything else is super
super good I love the way my skin looks
and this lip color is so cute I love you
guys so much and I will see you all in
my next video
