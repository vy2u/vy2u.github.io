today I'm gonna be doing a tutorial
dedicated to just the eyes now I'm using
these brushes from Holy Grail cosmetics
and I have teamed up with them to work
on this video for you guys now these
brushes you get a lot of violating
brushes and if you use the code Michael
all in capitals you'll get free shipping
and I'm sorry guys it's only in
Australia so yes without any further ado
let's get straight into this so first
thing you want to do is just take a
normal sort of brown shades is gonna be
used as your transition so the
transition goes between the eyebrow and
the lid color so basically I just take
that on one of the blending brushes and
just put that through my cruise through
my cruise and just kind of blend it up
until it's seamless and there's no harsh
lines and then just going in with a bit
more of a darker brown color just to
give that a little bit more definition
it's all about blending your colors are
from light to dark black to dark it
works very much better that way if you
go the other way it's a mess so yeah
basically I'm just blending those two
colors straight through my Land Cruisers
and hoping for the best and from what I
can see I'm pretty impressive with how I
went and then it's adding a highlight
color to my brow bone which is stunning
then for the lid color today I'm just
using a normal map brown color and I'm
just plopping that on my eyelid and I'm
kind of blending that up into my crease
area so what this does is it just gives
it like that gradient effect so it's
going from dark to light so from your
lid it's going from dark to light I just
said that but I'm saying it again then
I'm just taking like a packing brush and
just really packing on that brown color
I really wanted to avoid the black color
today because I just didn't want any
black in this I wanted to keep it quite
neutral then I'm just taking two of
those Brown shades that I use first
straight underneath my eye and blending
that down with a little blending brush
this a lot of people don't know but
using eyeshadow underneath your eye
completely brings the look together
sorry she's never done it before and
give it a shot give it a whirl then I'm
just blending that all out making sure
it's seamless
then I'm just going back in with that
dark brown color that I used on my lid
and just blending that right up against
my lash line
I really like the way this looks
that's an orange not orange but like
mutual no it's pretty it's pretty okay
then I'm just taking the wings liner
brush this part is optional I just
decided to do it because I can't do a
look without wings liner or I struggle
too it's basically I'm just taking that
straight across my lid and sharp as wing
when I did both my wings that were
completely uneven because I was like ah
but um everybody's okay and I still
struggle to get my wings on point
it's very hot I always get one I'm
really good with in the other I always
messes up and it's so irritating because
the English eyeliner is so hard to get
off and you can't really fix it once
it's on then I'm saying and then just
taking a little bit of highlight color
straight on the inner corners of my eyes
just to open them up a little bit more
and that is pretty much the whole I
looked on/off and I stuck some lashes on
to I should out that in sorry I hope you
guys enjoyed this really quick it's
simple and easy neutral smokey eye with
a Twins lineup if you did don't forget
to give me a massive thumbs up leave a
comment down below any other video
requests that you guys want to see I
love you guys so much and I'll see you
all in my next video which will be on
Friday so Oh bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
