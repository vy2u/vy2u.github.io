today I'm going to show you guys how to
get this exact look right here I just
want it to be a nice radiant and glowy
look pretty much so you can reawaken
your dull skin and make it look nice and
fresh and alive and I just like to say a
huge thank you to Rimmel for sponsoring
this video okay guys let's just get
straight into it I'm first taking the
Milani brow 6 powder I'm just taking the
darkest shade and I'm just going to be
running that through my brows what this
is going to do is it's just going to
fill in all those little sparse areas
and yeah just make them look a little
bit more defined I'm not going to make a
new shape or anything today I just
wanted to be really easy simple and
quick for everyone to follow then I'm
just taking the essence of make me brow
high brow gel mascara and I'm just
running that through my brow hairs
what's that what that is going to do is
it's just going to make my hair stay in
place all day and tint all those blond
hairs then I'm going to be taking the
Rimmel insta-fix and go this is a primer
and setting spray in one and it smells
so good for my foundation I'm going to
be taking the Rimmel wake me up
foundation this is basically just an
anti-fatigue foundation so it pretty
much just reawakens dull skins so the
wake me up foundation actually has a new
formula it's full of vitamin C and
vitamin C is so good for your skin
because it improves elasticity and it
brightens your skin for a radiant
healthy glow so this color of foundation
is in the shade 100 ivory it is the
perfect match for my skin tone to which
I love so I'm just pouncing that all
over my forehead and making sure
everything is all blended I'm also just
taking it over my eyes as well because
why not and just making sure it is all
blended out so the concealer this is the
Rimmel wake me up concealer and
basically this is just a skin
brightening formula and it helps like
illuminate you know like the dark areas
underneath your eyes and it pretty much
just makes you look more awake which is
so good because I think every single can
feel and needs that so I'm more or less
of taking that concealer around the
edges of my mouth my chin my Cupid's bow
my nose bridge and my forehead you guys
know exactly how I do it every time with
my concealer and I'm just blending that
out with my
damp sponge to make sure it is all
blended and seamless because that's what
I love
blending is everything and I'm just
learning underneath my eyes and I'm also
taking that concealer just what's left
on the sponge straight over the top of
my eyes as well just because I can just
making sure that is all blended it's
pretty straight forward from here this
makeup is so easy and so easy to follow
and that's what I love about it because
normally my looks are really hot not
hard to fire but you know there's a bit
to them and then just taking my Curtius
bun powder this is in it the shade I
guess translucent extra coverage it is
so good and when you take it on a damp
sponge to put underneath your eyes it
just melts into your skin that's pretty
much like with any powder and sponge
like when you put them mix them together
it just melts the product into your skin
if you have not tried it you need to try
because it's literally amazing so I'm
just applying that all underneath my
eyes I'm not really baking I'm kind of
just pressing it in so it until it
disappears I'm not really fitting any
powder there because we're not really
doing much eyeshadow today now to
contour my face I'm just taking the
essence shape your face contouring
palette and I'm in love with this
palette so I'm just taking it along with
my cheekbones and yeah basically just
contouring my whole face I also take it
around my forehead the sides of my nose
and my jawline because I do love having
a snatched contoured face like I can't
do a makeup look with our contouring
because otherwise my face does look
super super flat and I don't like it so
I'm just contouring away as you can tell
now just to bronze up my face that
little bit more because I felt like I
need it because I'm not tanned at the
moment and I'm quite pale so I'm just
warming up the skin with the Milani
Excel bronzer all over glow under my
chin my cheeks oughta be done pretty
much just everywhere I contour it where
I contour I like to bronze afterwards or
before sometimes depends on what sort of
mood I'm in and yeah just warming up the
skin now for my blush I'm just taking
the la girl blush palette and just
taking a mixture of those two pink
shades at the start and just popping
that on my cheeks as so now I did put a
little bit too much blush on so I just
dabbed over with my sponge and it fixes
everything
ribbing back onto the eyes I'm just
taking some more of that Milani exile
bronzer and I'm just putting that
through my cursor like right you know
Benji just putting that through my
creases with any fluffy brush doesn't
have to be perfect because I'm literally
just putting a bit of something through
the eyes I guess just to warm it up a
little bit because I love warm tones on
my eyes and of course a little tiny bit
underneath as well just to keep my eyes
nice and bright now I am just spritzing
my face with that makeup primer /
setting spray before highlighting so my
highlight pops a little bit more
severely I'm just taking the sleep flake
solis highlighter palette and I'm just
taking those two latter shades mixing
them together and just applying it to my
face and this has to be one of the best
drugstore highlighters I've ever used
it's just so good it blends so well and
it's super pigmented and shows up
extremely well as well and I'm also just
taking a little bit of that on the inner
corners of my eyes too just to brighten
everything now this mascara is
everything this is the Jordana best
extreme lash and I'm just applying that
all over my lashes and you can actually
pack this on so much and it layers so
well it doesn't make your lashes looks
buttery like summer skies do when you
lay them up this just thickens and
lengthens and it's super super black so
it's like jet black eye mascara face we
all do it we all do it and just a little
bit to my bottom lashes as well
and looks like somewhat on my top and
then just to set everything in place I'm
just taking the makeup and a setting
spray slash primer and it smells sorry
it sounds like cucumbers because there's
cucumber extract in it it's not so good
and then just to top off the look I'm
just taking different models prefer lip
tint just like a nice little flush of
pink canary and I'm just pumping that on
my lips and that is pretty much it I
hope you guys really enjoyed this video
if you did please don't forget to give
me a massive thumbs up I love you guys
so much and I will see you all in my
next video bye
