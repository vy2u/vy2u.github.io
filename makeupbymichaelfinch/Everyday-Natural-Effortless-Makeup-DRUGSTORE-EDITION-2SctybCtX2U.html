today I'm going to be doing in this
drugstore makeup tutorial this is all
using drugstore products kind of a first
impressions as well so you'll see what
does work and what doesn't work for me
I'm not really liking this lip color but
it was the best that I've got without
any further ado let's get straight into
that tutorial and if you enjoyed this
give it a thumbs up and yeah okay so
first thing we're using is the Garnier
skin Naturals perfect blur stuff I don't
really know what this is I don't even
know if it's a primer is it a primer oh
yeah okay well we're just gonna use it
as a primer anyway because this is about
anything that I've bought it kind of
looks like pore fessional but like a
pink yeah like why it's chunky
looks like boy Han this looks like
vaginal discharge discharge yarn you get
it when you get like infections down
there it's a hard thing it was like a
thing that everyone had to get okay so
I'm just applying that with a little
stippling brush hoping for the absolute
best vaginal discharge on my forehead
and squirt that on that actually looks
like a pink cut or it actually looks
like a pink cottage cheese it's gonna
like rub the excess in with my hands
just to make sure everything is covered
oh well sorry for foundation I'm gonna
be using the l'oreal paris infallible
24-hour matte foundation and i was going
to be applying that with a damp Beauty
Blender a lot of people have been saying
to me you should apply a foundation with
a damp Beauty Blender hon I do I just
never say in my videos that I wet it
because everyone sees me spray it with
mac fix+ but I never really say a damp
Beauty Blender so everyone thinks I'm da
man and I don't what
Beautyblender pop sure so I'm just
applying that with the damp Beauty
Blender and as you can see I'm just
applying it sorry I'm just applying this
with my damp Beauty Blender and I'm
blending it out and as you can see the
coverage is really quite good
this is probably my color obviously not
gonna be my colorful and I'm tan though
because that will change completely so
I'm just gonna squirt somewhere that
onto my Beauty Blender and just go onto
this side of my face if you guys haven't
tried the l'oreal infallible eye hundred
percent recommend it i don't know how it
stays during the day but the coverage
and i'm getting now is actually really
good sorry go out and try it if you
haven't already okay so for concealer
today i'm gonna be taking the Australis
concealer i haven't actually used this
before this is in the shade light and
it's just like in a little stick form so
what I'm gonna do is just apply that
under my eye and in like a little
triangle shape and I'm also just gonna
take a little bit over my eyelids just
use as a base of my eye shadow and then
I'm just gonna take my dad Beauty
Blender once again and just blend that
out so this is actually blending out
quite nicely so now to bake under my
eyes I'm taking the elf High Definition
powder and I haven't actually used this
in like so many years now I'm just gonna
take my Beauty Blender
again and just straight into that
translucent powder and I'm just gonna
put this onto my thighs now what I can
see already this is so finely milled it
basically disappears and it's not really
sitting on my skin well it kind of is
it's kind of just sinking right into my
under-eye area now I'm just gonna take
your stylist fresh and flawless powder
in the shade nude and I'm just gonna be
putting that all over my face just with
a big fluffy brush so I don't know if
you guys can see but where I just put
translucent powder it's kind of taken
off the concealer and I don't know why
it's done that that's kind of weird
that's never happened to me before but I
mean obviously the translucent powder
all the concealer is a piece of so
I'm just gonna move on from that and
move on to the rest of my face so to
contour my face a little bit I'm gonna
be taking the AC on to a Australis
contour kit yeah
I don't really recall if I have to use
this I think I used actually going a
video but I don't know how when so
where's gonna go in very very lightly
with this but first of all I'm just
gonna be taking the yellow shade on this
brush here and I'm just gonna put this
under my eyes to see if I can fix what I
just up so it's kind of how to an
extent but not all the way sorry to
contour I'm gonna be mixing a little bit
of these two together just really really
lightly because if you've used this
before you know how pigmented
the is and I'm kind of just gonna
use it as a bronzer and a contour I
don't know how this is gonna go I don't
know if this is gonna go muddy okay
that's kind of working less is more with
the Australis AC onto a kid so as you
give you have kind of got a bit of a
contour happening right now but I don't
know if this looks muddy or not I can't
tell I don't think it does though
on camera concept is a big straight line
so I'm just gonna run that around that
please blend out I don't know if this is
gonna blend out or not
oh yeah how sutherland okay grey this is
sorry pigmented but like not in a good
way it's pigmented in like a bad way so
now I'm just gonna kind of contour my
jawline lightly with this now I'm just
going to attempt to contour my nose and
this so slightly with this brush here I
don't want to do it too intense because
this does go quite money very quickly
but actually doesn't look that bad for a
drugstore contour I mean if you go
really really really lightly with it you
should be algae and I'm just going to do
a little bit under my bottom lip just to
give the appearance of a being a lip not
that I need that but I'm gonna do it
anyway
now before we do the eyes today I'm just
gonna finish the face off because it's
really starting to piss me off
I'm just gonna take my blush brush and
this is the essence blush up in the
color heatwave I feel I'm just gonna
look away to neon on me but I was gonna
give her a shot anyway and it goes
slightly into this side more than the
orange side no wrong way I want to go
more into the hard side of the pink side
hey I'm just gonna smile and lightly see
if this put some color on my cheeks so I
don't know if that's showing up on
camera very well but it's got a little
bit of pigment to it
but it's probably not the best drugstore
for highlighter today I'm going to be
using an essence highlighter this is
called blue meet-up and it is in the
shade I don't even know so I don't know
how this is gonna go because I've never
tried out a drugstore highlighter before
besides the mary-lou manizer but that's
kind of like considered high-end seeing
as they used to sell it in David Jones
and I'm just gonna dig it right into
that with my flat top flat top I mean my
fan brush well actually that's not
really that bad
like it's showing up not that bad I'm
actually pretty impressed with this one
we're gonna bring that down the bridge
of my nose the tip of my nose on my
Cupid's bow sorry my entire face is done
I've just got to do my eyes and my lips
now so I'll assume you guys in a little
bit so you can see a little bit closer
sorry for my eyes today i'm gonna be
using Maybelline the nudes eyeshadow
palette first color I'm gonna go into is
this a nudie color here I was gonna put
this all over my eyelid just to assure
that all my eyeshadows blend out nicely
cuz I'm not sure how this drugstore
palette is going to blend now we're
going to go into this light sort of
brown color here and I'm just gonna run
this through the data V on my crease and
just kind of across just because I do
have footed eyes you need to still be
able to see this yeah we're gonna go
into this darker Brown up here and I'm
just gonna take that on a little like
kind of more defined brush and just on
the out of feet down a little bit low I
don't want to bring this any higher then
I've just bought the other one just
gonna blend over the edge of that just
to bring it all together okay now I'm
gonna take a little bit more of that
darker brown and some of this black on
the same brush I'm just gonna go into
the knots with V of my eye now I'm gonna
take a little bit more of that doctor
Brown that I used secondly and just
blend that black out just with this
speaker brush now it's going to take a
little bit more of the darker Brown just
underneath my line I hate doing this on
camera I could never do it
oh now it's gonna go right into a little
bit of black and the brown and just on
the outer V of my eye
now for my mascara today I'm gonna be
taking the bushwa beauty-full volume
mascara and I haven't actually tried
this before I've had it for a long time
this is actually working almost exactly
like the benefit they're real Mustafa so
as you guys can see I'm just taping my
eyelid area really clear of different
color eyeshadow I want it to be really
mad and like annuity color on the lid
and this'll scar he's working so well
now from others today I'm gonna be using
the designer brands velvet lipstick in
the color bars sorry I'm not the biggest
fan of this lip color as it does look a
little bit odd but to try a good night
Laura sorry to go over the top of that
matte lipstick I'm just gonna take Nyx's
butter gloss in the shade angel food
cake whatever that is and I'm just gonna
plop that over the top and that's pretty
much everything done sorry I hope you
guys enjoyed it this video if you did
don't forget to give me a thumbs up and
I will see you on my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
