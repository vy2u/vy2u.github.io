Channel today I'm sorry fucking excited
because I'm finally gonna be trying out
the
fenty of beauty makeup now I have had a
little bit of this for quite some time
now but I haven't got the foundation and
the primer but now I've got the
foundation and the primer I can do this
for video that I've been wanting to do
ever since it came out
I have heard amazing things about this
foundation and I'm so excited I've also
got some adding new holiday galaxy
collection as well that I'm going to be
testing out for I'm super duper excited
that's what it looks like on the inside
I've got a few other things here two
highlighters contour sticks brushes all
that sort of stuff
without any further ado let's get
straight into this video and I really
hope you guys enjoy
whoo okay guys sir I actually just
filmed a look with this palette and
stuff but I did not like it at all so
this is my second time doing it so
hopefully I don't make any mistakes this
time it was a mess so round two let's go
okay so as the galaxy palette does not
have any transitions or any Brown chain
sitter or anything like that I'm gonna
be going in with the huda beauty
textured rose gold eyeshadow palette
just to lay down a base to store this
makeup look all comes together at the
end you not I mean
so first of all I'm just gonna be taking
a little bit of sandalwood from the huda
beauty palette and I'm just gonna run
that in my crease and I'm gonna be using
this as my transition a you know so I'm
just gonna pack on color and build this
up and we're gonna be doing cool train
shades today because I want it to go die
shadow that I'm using so I'm just gonna
keep building and blending this all the
way up okay so now I'm gonna be taking
the shade out of this palette called
cocoa and I'm just gonna focus that on
the outer V and bring this all the way
up literally all the way up through that
don't worry we're gonna blend it out in
a second lay it down
blend off soft that's my motto and now
we're gonna blend out cocoa
I'm just taking sandalwood on this brush
and blending out cocoa with that as well
because it will help the whole blending
process it's gonna kind of get the brush
and just kind of hit the outer edge and
kind of do it out into like a wing sort
of shape so I take the black shade out
of this palette called black truffle tap
off that shoot can just go straight into
my outer V and I'm really gonna pack
this on like I'm gonna go ham on this
shit now some take a little bit more
Carcar and I'm just gonna blend over the
edge of that black cuz it's just gonna
help blend it all out and kind of just
using dubbing motions to blend this
shadow back cuz I feel like that's
working really well actually now what
I'm gonna do is just take the black
shade I'm gonna drag it through my
crease now just taking a little bit more
Carcar I'm just gonna pack that over the
edge where I put black truffle and this
is just gonna help blend that black
shadow
say yes okay guys now moving on to the
galaxy palette I'm just gonna take mmm
let's take this dark green shade here
and I'm just gonna try packing that on
so these shadows are really chunky by
the looks of it so I'm not sure gonna
drown my brush with the fix+ and then
pick up some what products and then I'm
gonna go in and pack this green over my
lid area so I'm just gonna pack that
green over half of my lid more so now
what I'm gonna do is kind of wipe off my
brush and then I'm gonna take this
latter green shade here just on the same
brush and drown my brush in fix+ again
by the way if my face is getting really
red at times it's because I got skin
nailing done yesterday and my skin is
really sensitive sorry if I get a little
bit hot my whole face goes red because
it's super sensitive at the moment but
anyway then I'm just gonna pack on this
green shade wow that's so nice and I'm
just gonna kind of bring it in so it's
actually a really nice green sort of
smoky smoky eye I'd call this a smoky
eye but these shadows pack on so well
you just have to use fix+ with them they
literally just fall off your face
because they're quite chunky but once
you mix up with fix+ it's like wow
that's a really intense in a good way do
you not I mean okay so I'm quite
impressed with this eye so far I'm
really digging this green that call tone
smokey eye I'm gonna go ahead and do the
side off-camera and clean up my fallout
because well see ya and I'll be right
back okay guys so I've just gone off
camera and done a big fuck-off a wing
I'm loving this I look to do my wing I
use the senti beauty Neptune's twin one
glitter eyeliner Eclipse there's a lot
going on on the bottom of this so I'm
not really sure which one it is but I'm
just gonna go ahead and do a wing on
this eye
okay so I'm super happy with these wings
I actually love this liner it's so
pigmented it's very very good
so I'm sewing like these wings dry just
gonna pop some mascara on so for my
lashes today I just use the lash
paradise from L'Oreal and the Lilly
ghalichi lashes in the style Miami now
getting started on my face I'm gonna be
taking this primer here from Fenty II
and this is meant to be a instant
retouch primer soft matte okay no why is
RiRi so let's pop this on that's the
consistency of Anne it's kind of like
the consistency of a moisturizer or it
smells so good you know how some prime
is more like absolute shit
this smells amazing so for my foundation
today I'm gonna be using the soft matte
long-wear Foundation Fundy tint this is
in the shade 120 per filter let's give
this a whirl I've heard amazing things
about this but I've heard that it does
dry super fast so we're just gonna work
in sections see how it blends out and
then we'll go from there so I'm just
gonna squirt some of that onto the back
of my hand and already it is quite a
runny consistency I've also got two
brushes here that I can try out this is
the Fenty Beauty 11 foundation brush
it's a really nice packaging oh this has
gone everywhere Wow okay so I'm just
gonna start by popping this on just
gonna dot that over that part of my face
that's gonna take my Beauty Blender and
I'm just gonna see how this blends our
hearts
this color is way too laughs me at the
moment just because I am a little tiny
bit tan and skin needling does bring out
the color in your skin but we're gonna
make it work this video needs to grow up
you guys have been asking for I review
for quite a while now so as you guys
could probably tell the coverage is so
good already it's dried very matte and
kind of looks like a powder I'm just
gonna go ahead and do a second layer and
see how that goes
feel like when I'm using my Beauty
Blender it's kind of leaving little
mocks in the skin or it's not just it
drying
either way the coverage
and it's so good you can kind of see how
well the coverage is just because my
skin is so red at the moment after my
treatments yesterday okay so I'm just
gonna keep popping this on and blending
it all out as we go it hasn't dried too
fast but it could in a second so let's
find out huh
now I've definitely come to the
conclusion that this foundation is not
my color but we're going to make it work
to conceal as venta Beauty does not have
a concealer as of yet I'm just gonna
take the tart shape type in the shade
fair neutral this is the whitest one
literally that they do so I'm just gonna
conceal in the regular areas which I
normally would think this is even a
little bit darker than the foundation
that could be a pop one just gonna blend
this out it's blending out pretty well
over the foundation which is good
dumps gonna take that same concealer and
just highlight underneath my eyes and
I'm just gonna blend out as per usual
okay guys now I'm gonna take the contour
stick in the shade latte
now let's see how this goes hopefully
it's not true orange for this thing okay
it's just gonna blend or what hon okay
well that's literally blended into
nothing pretty much it's a very thick
consistency and it's literally blending
into nothing like I'm blending that out
with my Beauty Blender and it's just
more so doing nothing at all instead of
applying it directly to my skin I'm just
going to take it on my Beauty Blender
and then I'm just gonna go in with that
and see if we get more pigment
okay sir I don't think I'm a fan of the
contour stick just because it's so hard
to work with and it kind of blends into
nothing you really have to build up the
products to get a good color payoff um
but yeah everything else was pretty good
so far now the next thing I'm gonna be
trying out is this unicorn highlighter
stick here it's purple so I'm just gonna
take this damp sponge here this is from
Mecca this one and I'm just gonna see if
I can pop a product on okay we're not
gonna use that oh my god that just
fucked with all the foundation so bad oh
my god
no okay I'm not gonna be using that
because that is literally fucking with
my shit
no thank you I'm just gonna go over that
highlighter that I just put down and try
to cover it up because that looked sorry
that it went so like it just moved all
the foundation underneath and everything
that was not cute so now that I've baked
I'm just gonna go back in with my Rimmel
stay matte powder and I'm just gonna go
over the rest of my face I'm not going
to be using those highlighted sticks
just because that looked really really
horrible you don't really need to set
the rest of this foundation because
literally I'm touching my skin and it
feels like powder like honestly it sets
itself you don't need to set it pretty
much but I'm going to just because I'm
like an extra bitch and all that to
contour my face a little bit I'm just
going to take the Physicians Formula
bronze booster palette I'm just gonna
take the call translate in the middle
just to contour my face
so I've got two highlighters here I've
got trophy wife which is that really
intense gold one and then I've got
killer where do they're sorry I think
I'm gonna be using kilowatt today just
because trophy wife if I was to put this
on my skin oh my god it would be the
biggest mess it'd be worse and stick
that I just used before but look how
beautiful that is I'll have to use this
in a tutorial one day just because it is
so pretty on my eyes going in today I'm
gonna be taking kilowatt highlighter
these are sorry hard when you have
acrylics on alright so here is kilowatt
and I'm just gonna be taking some of
this Wow okay there's I spread no
product on my face okay guys so this is
just it with no if it's plus or anything
I've been using this with my highlighter
brush lightly just because I've lost one
my highlighter brushes and I really like
applying with a small brush because you
can really get up on in there okay so
that is very pretty but I do want to
spray my brush with a little bit of
fixed plus to see if it gets a little
bit more intense you know what I mean oh
yeah now we're talking
guess when you build it up it like
really comes together and when you look
straight on you can't tell that you've
got highlighter on but as soon as you're
like turn to the side it's like wow like
you need to calm the fuck down
okay that's nice that's pretty I just
wish you could see it from front on to
not I mean maybe I'll just put a little
bit I might shake down here because why
not
I think the consistency of these
highlighters are quiet wet which is good
because it's buildable its blendable
definitely not a chunky highlighter you
guys know I had my chunky highlights
this is really really nice and it's
blending out like see what I mean like
it's blending out wherever you want it
to go so I'm kind of just talking the
whole lot on my cheek because why not
I'm gonna take a little bit of the other
side here I'll take some of this and
just pop it on my cheek like literally
the apple of my cheeks that's a little
bit dramatic but I mean it looks good so
rock on no I'm just gonna highlight my
Cupid's bow my nose I really like this
highlighter to be honest and mine areas
and bridge just a little bit on there
like that okay I really need to finish
off my under eyes don't mean wow
really taking my time with this but I'm
exploring with new products and I'm
having fun I really liked this book so
far so good so let's dive back into the
galaxy palette and see what we can do
underneath these eyes just so you guys
get like kind of like a full rundown at
the palette I'm just gonna use shimmery
shades underneath my eyes that might not
look the best for this look but I just
want you two guys to get the full monty
out of this palette you know what I mean
so fuckin rock on I'm just gonna dust
away some of this baked that I've still
got sitting here oh my god this powders
so good I use the Maybelline fit me
powder to bake I am obsessed it's taken
over all of my other powders it doesn't
oh it's just so good okay shut up
fenty let's do it for my inner corner
highlight on my eyes today I'm gonna be
taking this shade right here this is
called I don't know Milky Way they're
all in the back but like do we really
care what they're called I mean I don't
actually instead of that that's a little
bit too silver I'm just gonna take it
this Shea here and pop that in it's kind
of the same shirt anyway but whatever
now underneath my eye we're gonna do
light shades under the eye I never do
that but we're gonna do it today so
whatever umm I don't know what color to
do it's start hard to choose but I feel
like we should going with the should we
do blue let's just do blue okay I'm
gonna go in with this bully shade here
oh my god this is so not me at all but
you know out of the box stepping out of
the box Han I'm gonna pop this
Rylander oh I think I got some in my eye
oh oh oh I'm gonna blend this halfway
underneath my eye just actually blends
out really really well it's kind of got
a map consistency underneath it as well
as the shimmery so it kind of does both
which I'm lacking so you can smoke it
out underneath that eye you know okay
you straight after that I'm gonna take
this light blue shade right here and
this is super chunky it's literally like
the formula over glitter but I'm
definitely gonna need a little bit of
fixed plus with this baby I feel like
you need a lot of fixed pass with this
color otherwise it's just not going to
stick so I managed to get it to stick a
little bit better I didn't use any
glitter glue or anything I just use the
fix plus you pop that on I also throw in
some bottom mascara as well lash
paradise by L'Oreal but now I'm gonna
take the Marc Jacobs eyeliner pencil in
the shade in the buff it's like kind of
like a Goldy like I don't really know
what color is but I'm gonna pop this in
my waterline okay didn't really make
much of a difference but anyway so today
we have a few different lip options the
first one I'm just gonna try out is this
this is the first lip gloss that came
out gloss balm then Tegeler I'm just
gonna wipe the shit off my lips now I
did watch an interview with Rihanna and
she said it took a lot of time to get
this lip gloss shade because she wanted
to suit everyone's skin challenges are
really good so versatile that is a very
pretty gloss nothing too like wow like
that's amazing but it smells good and
it's not sticky we also have these 4
other lip glosses here I'm not gonna try
them all but I'm just gonna give them
some swatches on my arm for you guys
sorry this is one here this is like a
purple Sheen tone this is called gal on
the moon gala on the moon how are you
dull so that's that one there that's
kind of pretty you know very like
holographic looking like I wouldn't wear
on an everyday basis but these are cool
this next one here is called oh my god
blue tonic relationship oh that's gorge
so this is like a intense super super
intense pink shade there gel this next
one here is a bit of a darker one this
one's called Astro naughty
that's pretty it's like a burgundy
you like glitter a there's sorry
glittery they've all got glitter in them
which Celia love it or you hate at Han
and this last one I'm gonna swatch is
called space suit and that's that one
there that's just a close-up of the
glasses I'm just gonna line my lips with
this Kat Von D everlasting lip liner in
the shade bow and arrow
okay so I've just lined my lips with the
bow and arrow a lip liner I'm just gonna
go straight over the top with that first
gloss that I showed you guys this was
from the first release just because it's
not enough by itself I feel like it
needs something underneath it okay so
this is pretty much everything done my
overall thoughts the foundation is
really really nice you just got to work
with a fast because it does dry super
super quickly the primer you can never
really tell with primers straight off
the bat
the eyeshadows are really really nice I
just wish there had matte colors in
there so you could do a full look with
it the eyeliner was also really good and
the gloss is nothing special but it
smells good it's not too sticky and I
like that it suits all skin tones
apparently a lot of thought was put into
that so I really do like that and my
favorite thing of this whole tutorial
was definitely the highlighter because
it is so blinding and so intense I know
this whole overall look is in everyone's
cup of tea but honestly there's only so
much you can do with this eyeshadow
palette so this is what I came up with
anyway I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video if you did make sure you give
it a massive thumbs up for me I love you
guys so fucking much and I will see you
all in my next video see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
