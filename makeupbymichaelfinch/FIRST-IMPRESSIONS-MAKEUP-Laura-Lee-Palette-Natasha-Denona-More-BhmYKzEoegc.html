channel now I really hope this
background isn't too much to handle
I know it's yellow and it's a little bit
intense but I wanted to change up the
color of my background background once
again so it's yellow and reminds me of
bumble bees and happiness and love
speaking of love I'm wearing this
choosing yes t-shirt today eh I got sent
this ages ago from coach Kings but I
never got the chance to even wear it so
I'm gonna wear it today supporting a
marriage equality because why the
not so today I'm gonna be doing a full
face of first impressions once again
I've got a ton of makeup in front
of me that I need to try out ASAP while
it's new and you guys are asking for my
review on it so yeah I'm just gonna do a
full face of first impressions let's get
straight into this video
okay so I just did my brows off-camera
as per usual because I don't have any
new brow products to try out as usual so
let's get onto my eyes now what am I
going to use I've got so many new
eyeshadow palettes here I've got the UH
Nastasia prism palette I've got the new
zoeva palettes um
I've got one here from nos but I really
want to try out I think for today I'm
gonna be using these true I'm gonna be
trying out the Laura Lee Los Angeles
palette now I have already tried this in
a video that you guys would have seen on
my channel last week but I didn't give
you guys my full first impressions on
this or I'm gonna try this out again
I'll use this again and then I'm gonna
be using a little bit of the-- natasha
Janardhan holiday collection because the
other one that I used at this was Bom
sorry yeah I'm just gonna be taking my
trusty top shape take today to prime my
lids because I do not have a you can see
LA so I just quickly concealed under my
brows and now I'm just gonna pop this
concealer all over my eyelid area get a
nice concealed base ready for the shadow
to just lie on top of damn Beauty
Blender and go to town I clean all my
beauty blenders yesterday they were all
absolute filth like they were so gross
and God I cleaned them because they were
just sour like actually like two loci on
the verge of going mouldy no not really
that's disgusting but seriously that I
said this in place today I'm just gonna
be taking a little bit of the makeup
forever Pro finished powder lightly got
the sniffles today awesome now for the
fun part I'm going to be taking the oily
Los Angeles cat's pajamas palette now
the first shade I'm gonna be taking out
of this is bomb diggity which is like
the most perfect mustard a transition
color I'm just gonna start by buffing
this into my crease and I'm gonna bring
it all the way across to my inner corner
now it can take a bigger brush and just
blend over the edge of that these
eyeshadows are super super pigmented and
they do blend out extremely well I've
seen a lot of reviews on this palette
they've all been quite positive to be
honest like I'm really happy with the
shadows you guys know I'm not gonna suck
another youtubers ass even if it is a
 product this is generally a good
product and I did give it a bit of a
trial run in the video that I did last
with Lily and I really liked it
so I had a bit of a chance to play with
that before I got to like you know do an
actual view honor and let you guys know
what I thought of it now I'm just gonna
be dipping into the shade called kooky
just on the same brush that I used for
the eye shadow before and I'm just gonna
start popping this into my crease and
like deepening everything up so it's
gonna be bringing out all the way across
you guys notice that my botox is
completely like a low-key worn off now
damn it and I can frown look this is
weird I've actually got facial
expression everyone keeps coming for me
I'm just gonna put this out there
everyone keeps saying oh my god your
little kids just giving like bigger and
bigger and bigger I have not had
anything put in my lips on my face for
that matter since I moved to Brisbane
which was July or June this year I don't
know which one it is because they both
start with J's but honestly I haven't
had anything put in them since then so
everyone who keeps saying your lips just
keep getting bigger and bigger Michael
like they're actually not getting bigger
than if anything they're getting smaller
so you need it relax okay so I'm just
building up at this color and packing it
on and blending it out as I go but I
won't take that big brush that I was
using before and just go over the edges
and just make sure everything is blended
out of there all right now I'm gonna dip
into the Natasha Turner palette now I
don't want to tip this upside down
because they do comp out unfortunately
but I'm gonna take this shade right here
this bright Marone pinky tone I guess
wow this color this formula of the
eyeshadow is actually really hard to
pack on it's almost like it's really
thick it's not working yeah slightly
geez okay but it's working that's the
main thing right now I'm just taking a
little bit of cookie from the cat's
pajamas palette I'm just blending over
the edges
I thought Natasha don't know no I said
I've just put down blending and super
Wow I'm really impressed with this so
far so good with first impressions I
really don't know what I look I ever go
for I just kind of do it and see what
happens
sorry that's why it takes a little bit
longer than normal so next time it's
gonna be going in with the shade oddball
from the cat's pajamas palette just on
this little
blending brush and I've got just here
and I'm gonna focus that on the outer V
and kind of like like seamlessly somehow
blend it into these other shadows that
I've got I'm going on here this is sorry
pigmented and sorry black are you guys
seeing this holy I'm obsessed I'm
gonna drag this all the way across and
tuck it into my crease unlike my inner
corner now it's gonna take a little bit
more of cookie and I'm just going to
blend over the edges of that black and
kind of like blend it all in together do
you know what I mean
okay that's exactly what I wanted and
the look I was going for so that's
perfect and now I'm gonna be taking a
little bit of the shade okie dokie which
is like this highlighting shade here and
I'm just gonna pop that directly under
my brow bone I'm gonna bring it down so
it like pops my grab around a little bit
okay so for my eyelid today I'm gonna be
trying at the Natasha - Nonna chroma
crystal topcoat i shadow actually
don't even know what it is to be honest
I just know that it goes on your eyes
anyway let's give it a well so it's like
a got its got like a really dry like
weird oh my god it's so pigmented though
well I hope this works on the eye I'm
just gonna grab a little brush and I'm
just gonna go over my lid area okay once
that on is on there how it's gonna take
a brush and I'm just gonna dip into this
okay so it's very pretty but it's very
crumbly I wonder if I wet it with some
fix+
if i wet this when it works it's gonna
be great damn it okay so that's managed
to work I managed to get that all over
my lid thank God now I'm gonna take just
a little brush and just kind of blend
over the edges this still has a little
bit of cookie left on it button some
take a little bit more to help blend
into the edges of the shadow and kind of
bring it up okay so now that my eyes are
almost done I actually just went across
the top of my lash line just with a
little bit of liquid liner I use the NYC
liquid eyeliner pen and I'm just went
straight across there just nice and
tight to my lash line now I'm gonna move
on to mascara I'm gonna be trying out
the bare minerals
domination Escarra but I'm not gonna
talk when I do it because we all know
what happens when I do that probably not
the greatest mascara I've ever used it's
not really doing much just kind of like
your average ish mascara I would
probably rate this like a 5 out of 10 or
maybe a 4 3 or 4 now for my lashes today
I'm gonna be trying out a new pair of
lashes that I've got here these are in
the style jasmine and these are by a
brand called a dull Beauty so I'm gonna
pop these on and I'll be right back okay
now that my eyes are all done on the
tops of them I'm gonna be moving on to
my face now for my primer today I'm
gonna be trying out the Wonder Glory by
Charlotte Tilbury um I haven't really
tried many Charlotte Shelby products
before this looks sorry
bridgie Oh smells good too
that's always nice Olivia how I get it I
get it how I live it has anyone heard
that new song with Rihanna called lemon
oh my gosh it's so like damn it's like
it's so good so good so now for my
foundation I'm gonna be trying out the
laura mercier flawless using ultra long
wear foundation now this is in the shade
Chelle so I'm gonna give this a whirl so
I'm just gonna squirt some of this onto
the back of my hand kind of looks like
my color kind of doesn't so I'm just
gonna start by dotting this all over my
skin once that's all dotted I'm just
gonna take a little bit on my Beauty
Blender and then I'm just gonna go
straight up bone in here and start
blending this in it's giving off a
really nice finish like it's giving a
very skin-like texture I'm really liking
this it looks like it's full coverage
but it's giving the effect that it
doesn't really look like I've got much
foundation on which I'm really lacking
it's very skin-like
looking it's not too cakey okay this
foundation definitely does dry quite
fast and having a little bit of trouble
blending out these last bits on my
forehead just because I did put them on
I like I am blending them out last so as
you can see see what I mean like it
dries quite fast kind of like the fenty
one not really into foundations that dry
fast cuz I hate working fast with makeup
I like to take my time and like chill
out and like not be rushed you know what
I mean okay I really do like the finish
of it though like it looks like skin oh
my god I do have any concealer I can try
out damn it but I am going to be trying
this under my
this is from Sephora I bought this when
I was in at the US of A this is in the
shade a butter cream this is just a gel
serum can feel ah hmm I don't know how
we're gonna go with this well we're
gonna give it a whirl the dough fits
absolutely you get like a no
product when you use it but I'm just
gonna see how it blends this is super
super super light coverage of a
concealer this one and it's literally
taking off the foundation that's
underneath okay we are not gonna be
using that today I do not like that
concealer that's going in the bin
instead I'm just gonna go in it with the
tight shape tape and I'm just gonna go
straight over what I just made a mess of
I'm just gonna put some under my eyes
too and I'm gonna let it sit there for a
bit I saw someone do it the other day
they let their under eye concealer sit
there for a bit and kind of just like
get thicker and dry a little bit so it's
more full coverage but I forget who it
was I'm just gonna burn this all out
hey babe I'm just feel filming can I
call you back later ah thank you he a
little cutie oh my god that was my best
friend
from Melbourne bless her she was calling
me to say congratulations on selling up
my match she's so cute I miss her so
much just was looking pretty good so far
of course knowing me I do not have a new
powder to try out so I'm just gonna
quickly bake my undereyes with the
Maybelline fit me setting powder in the
shade fair Claire cuz this has topped
all my powders lately this is everything
to me it makes your under eyes look so
smooth and seamless and it's just
overall amazing I am obsessed in its
drugstore and it's my new fave so I'm
just gonna pop that under my eyes now
it's all as on OS and it's all as on
trust love that song Nicki
Minaj's everything she needs to come
back to Australia I sat because me and
Lily want to go to every single show
he's made this thing where like if she
goes to like Melbourne Brisbane Sydney
we're going to every single show we're
not even joking cuz we're literally
obsessed this is just proof that I
haven't had botox done for so long I've
got forehead lines and foundation sinks
into them again
I need to get it done I need to get my
forehead done everyone's been getting
like their lips dissolve lately it's
starting to scare me like a big lips
going out of
you know thing well they never will for
me because I will forever have big lips
actually maybe not who knows okay now
does dipping back into then it's
happening at a certain tone at palate
I'm gonna go back in with this shade and
I'm gonna put this right up against my
lash line and pack it the on so
it's so intense okay once that's put
under my eyes and take a little bit more
of a bomb diggity and I'm just gonna pop
that underneath that pink shade just to
kind of give a bit of a transition
blending out onto underneath my eye now
it's gonna take a little bit of oddball
this black shade up in the corner here
and I'm just gonna pop this just in the
outer V of my lash line I'm not gonna
bring it across now I'm trying to set
the rest of my face with the makeup
forever Pro finished powder and as I go
I'm just gonna dust off that baked and
I've had sitting there for a bit yeah
perfect yeah okay and now to contour I'm
gonna be trying out the Charlotte
Tilbury face sculpt and highlight
palette so I'm gonna be taking the
sculpting side it just here okay so it's
very not pigmented but it's really nice
like the way it's blending onto the skin
I like this this is good now for a
little bit of color and blush on my
cheeks today I'm gonna be taking the
zoeva opulence palette now in here we
have a highlighter and I think two
blushes I'm pretty shocked but I'm gonna
be trying out this a middle shade right
here oh my god this is the nice splash
oh it's like a peachy tar and I love
this blush whoa yes so Ava oh my god I'm
just gonna Park the blush on today
because know me I'm not really a blush
fanatic but like this color is
everything and it goes so well with me
pretty what the was that
see ya so next to my highlighter today
I'm gonna be trying out the new touch
highlighting palette skin twinkle volume
2 and okay I'm just gonna say packaging
is like this is everything so sleek and
taut tie letters are one of my favorites
they probably come second after the Ofra
highlighters like that good anyway I'm
gonna dip into the shade called daylight
it's just here it's just on this little
brush because I still can't find any of
my highlighting brushes because they're
mister
gone missing which I don't appreciate
and I'm just gonna pop this on my cheeks
I'm gonna mix in a little bit of
spotlight as well it's a bit of a darker
highlighter and I don't normally do this
but I'm just gonna spritz my brush with
a little bit of six-plus oh my god
done this is this is pretty this is
absolutely everything and now for my lip
color I'm gonna be trying out the I love

lip so I'm just gonna pop this on and
