my channel so today I'm going to be
doing the full face highlighter
challenge it's what they've been calling
it so basically a girl called Maria I'm
pretty sure her name was did this like
full face and then Jeffery and then
Nikki Tut's like they're all caught on
to it so that's what I'm gonna be doing
today now obviously when it's like full
face of highlighters it obviously can't
be all highlighters like eyeliner is not
a highlighter um so there's a few little
perks to it but basically you need to be
absolutely glowing now we all know I
love a little bit of highlight but I do
have quite a bad skin so I'm kind of
scared how this is gonna turn out
so um without any further ado let's get
straight into it so be prepared guys
because I'm literally gonna be putting a
lot of product on my face first ever
want to be going in with benefits that
gal primer this is like a luminous sort
of glow face I believe I haven't really
used it before but we're going to be
using a lot of everything so as you can
already see that's got a bit of a sheen
next step is Mac strobe cream so I'm
just gonna be getting quite a generous
amount of there
oh I'm literally using it as like a
moisturizer it's kind of cool
well I doesn't smell very good for
foundation today I'm going to be going
back to my Holy Grail foundation since
the Arbonne perfecting liquid foundation
SPF 15 so not much at all and spreading
that onto the back of my hand and just
with my Beauty Blender there using a
Beauty Blender is going to give your
overall look a more Julia sort of finish
and I want to be quite minimal with my
foundation today just because I don't
want it to cover up too much stuff you
can already see that I've got a bit of a
glow but I just hope this foundation
don't cover it up now we started raw a
little bit of concealer because I'm not
going to do a look without these little
bags chilling under my eyes so I'm just
going to use the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer in the shade fair neutral and
I'm just gonna be putting that
underneath my eyes the bridge of my nose
Cupid's bow my chin and then just a
touch on my forehead going back in with
the damp Beauty Blender once the space
is over the fun part will stop yeah we
all know I can't renege
without doing a little bit of baking so
I'm just going to take my Beauty Blender
again and just take the tiny bit of
credit as fine powder and just
underneath my eyes just because I really
don't want this to crease at all now for
the extra fun part I'm gonna be taking a
Girl Meets pearl highlighter from
benefit my hands are so sticky from all
the strobe cream I can't get the lids
off anything and I'm taking a generous
amount of everything of Oliver so I'm
just blending that highlighter in all
over my face
now next step I'm going to be taking
Becca's cream highlighter in opal I'm
going to be dipping my Beauty Blender
into that now what I'm going to do is
start putting that all over my face now
I know it doesn't look too crushed hot
at the moment that's because we're only
at the beginning but I am you know
glowing quite a bit bitches the whole
point of the whole video so this doesn't
look that intense but when the powder
highlight goes on you wait what I'm
going to do first off and just get my
own apollyon purtis camera finish powder
foundation and I'm just going to put a
little bit along under my cheekbone here
up in the corners of my face because I
am just going to be doing a tiny bit of
contouring and I'm just going to be
taking benefits paulla bronzer here just
on a fiber brush and I'm just going to
be contouring ever so slightly this
isn't really contrary I call it more
like warming up the face so they're just
going bit to Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray yeah I'm just going with
their mary-lou manizer by the balm and
I'm just gonna do just gonna have you
know I'm just gonna have some fun with
this oh my god this is gonna be so but
I'm literally just gonna paint my whole
entire face in highlighter
it's going to be run to a bigger brush
now because I feel like it's more
appropriate
holy
I feel like this highlight is just not
strong enough yet like it needs to be
stronger now it's going to be going in
with the highlighter from OPV called
Stardust all those highlighters so
strong I want to look wet I literally
want to look soaking wet
now once your whole face is covered with
that I'm sorry going back in with
another highlighter called glam Oh Russ
same from our TV and I'm gonna take matt
roush again and see if I can make this a
little bit stronger oh yeah definitely
can make it stronger
I want to satellites from space to
literally pick me up so I just zoom you
guys in a little bit just so you can see
a little bit better how much I'm
actually adding now just to make things
that little bit more intense I'm just
going to be going in with back our
champagne pot just because I feel like
it's not strong enough yet I just want
to make it a little bit more stronger
actually to be honest I don't know this
can go any stronger yes it can look out
looking like the Tin Man is always going
to be worth it so this is champagne pot
I'm currently putting it on now okay
guys now to make myself look somewhat
normal I'm just going to be doing a wing
using my Maybelline gel liner
so once your humongous wings are on
let's make this look a little bit more
you know somewhat humane and I'm gonna
be taking my Mac extended play gigablack
lash mascara and coating my top and
bottom lashes with this for my lashes
today I'm going to be using boudoir from
House of lashes and pretty sure these
are now my lashes are on I'm going to be
moving on to lips and today I'm going to
be using Jeffery straw red drum because
I saw Nikki types do a red lip and I
feel like it looked really good so I'm
gonna do one too just before I finish up
I'm just going to take my Urban Decay
makeup setting spray again and set
everything completely
so I hope you guys enjoyed my full face
highlighter challenge and I'll see you
all in my next video
