today I'm a little bit scared to be
honest
Oh first of all don't my hair back
blonde again because I was over the blue
surprise surprise so today I'm going to
be attempting to do the full face of
liquid lipstick challenge and I'm
actually shooting myself because the
thing that I'm most scared about is
actually getting this off my face like
liquid lipstick is hot enough to get off
your lips let alone your entire face so
I'm kind of scared of that part the most
without any further ado I'm just going
to get straight into it and pray for me
because I'm gonna need it this is
actually so terrifying I'm just going to
like sketch out my foundation shade
I'm gonna have to use so much of this so
for foundation I'm gonna use jeffree
star I'm nude and I'm gonna stipple it
out with a stippling brush oh yeah I
guess that works yeah that works okay
so probably a little bit too pink for me
but to be honest don't care oh god the
more I put on the more I'm dreading
taking it off you feel hmm I must say
it's blending up very well hopefully
when I highlight and contour this whole
pink this off icon oh so in an
attempt to highlight my under eyes I'm
going to be taking a drug lord from
Jeffrey Stehr and this is the plain
white your - I can I'm gonna blend that
out straight away because I feel like
it's just not going to blend that all
this could work this could work I'm
going to do this part I'm just going to
do a little bit at a time just because I
know it dries so fast and it is quite
hard to blend out time to highlight the
nose and the forehead
look at the difference player this
actually blends out so nicely
surprisingly enough like it looks
blended it's just not my skin color okay
so we are highlighted now let's move on
to some contouring to contour today I'm
going to take jeffree star dominatrix
and look everyone just say
prayer because I'm gonna need it what do
you think darling
Oh icon I literally cannot do you know
what this it works that is not so
bad after all
oh my god I'm living actually like this
is a concho anime is this more often I'm
just going to add a little bit more just
because I'm feeling game today you know
maybe that wasn't a great idea okay that
was definitely not the best idea I've
ever had I just have my contour with a
 plane it's you know not looking
that like the MoMA looks quite muddy
okay let's do this part slow back back
why don't you rush it's a blender
stories I'm against the rules cuz I'm
just gonna do it slow oh I can't
coordinate with that I need to do oh my
god what the just happened up in
here Oh dick dick dick dick dick dick
dick dick dick oh no I have a feeling I
 this up oh I've got this huh oh
my god that's gone so patchy oh my god
it's coming off when I touch it okay I
need to fix this
i'ma take some jeffree star new which is
my foundation and I'm gonna see if I can
clean this up cuz that just looks
on a whole new level maybe I should stop
using the same brush to do everything
that's probably one of my main problems
now the most important part of
contouring is always the jawline
why isn't this blending out this is
drying literally so quickly when I put
it down why me
I'm so stressed like I'm actually
stressed like I just blended that and
still alone what even is life now
for a nice little bit of blush today I'm
just gonna take Afra Daytona Beach
everybody pray for me because I'm gonna
need it oh oh there's like no going back
now is the aah Daytona Beach
let's take Panama but overall and
hopefully this is no better just
blending that out with my dip clean
brush oh my god I forgot to contour my
nose I'm so scared for this part just
going to take a really little amount of
dominatrix well flip up into the brow
there listen take my blending brush and
attempt to blend it less is
definitely more less is definitely more
listen take a little bit of I'm nude
again just down the sides of my nose to
try and clean that up a little bit
because it was so intense just gonna do
a little bit more highlighting along the
bridge of that nose for my brows today
I'm going to use posh spice with an
angled brush I'm happy with this I'm
happy with this brow color very happy
now attempting to clean up under the
brows I'm going to take druglord again
by Geoffrey
okay now that my brows are done let's do
my eyes now in an attempt to do some eye
shadow I'm going to take Geoffrey start
Gemini and I'm going to pop that on my
eyelid I'm just going to see if I can
smudge that out nicely oh yeah oh yeah
I'm also just going to be taking a
little bit of Gemini underneath my eye
I'm aware that I look sick but don't
worry it will come together now to
define my crease a little bit more I'm
going to be taking colour pop okay and
we're going on the RV in the temptu
blends Isabel and I'm just applying that
all over my lid because why not go for
the whole smokey effect
ah ah oh
can make a mistake just get your
foundation and just go straight over
that mistake with your foundation and a
little bit of highlighter and it should
cover up quite nicely you see that see
look what that's done covered it
completely so I'm just going to try to
keep blending that underneath my eye
what we're going to do next is take
weirdo by jeffree star cosmetics and I'm
going to put a little bit of that on the
back of my hand and I'm gonna go
straight into my waterline
don't worry these are I save
now in an attempt to do a wing everybody
pays for me so I've got Geoffrey start
me a toe on hand so I'm going to bring
that across my eyelid
check out that window oh yeah
now for my mascara today I'm just going
to take weirdo again and I'm gonna run
that through the end of like a spoolie
brush just hope for the best now because
I simply cannot live without my lashes
I'm just going to apply some of them now
for my actual lip color today i'm going
to be using midi by color pop oh what a
journey that was but guys this is the
completed look full face using liquid
lipsticks only - the lashes and the lash
glue but everything else has been done
with liquid lipsticks and it seriously
 me up I'm literally so scared to
go and get this off now because I feel
like it's just gonna be hell on a whole
new level if you guys think that I
nailed this challenge makes you give
this video a thumbs up and if you think
I didn't then do whatever you want I
mean whatever to be honest I think I did
pretty well with this I could have done
better but you know it is hard because
it's liquid lipsticks it goes patch it
goes muddy I think I did a quite a good
job and I'm very proud of myself
I thought it could've been much much
worse anyway guys I will see you all in
my next video have a great night day
wherever the world you are and I'll see
you all next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
