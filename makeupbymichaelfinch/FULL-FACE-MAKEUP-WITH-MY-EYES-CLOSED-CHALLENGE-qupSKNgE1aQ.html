are new welcome today I'm gonna be
trying to do a full face of makeup with
my eyes closed now I don't know how this
is gonna go I haven't actually seen this
been done before on YouTube sorry I
literally have no idea what this is
gonna look like but like you never know
you never know what's gonna happen so
I'm just gonna give it a whirl and see
what happens now I'm making the rules up
for this challenge so basically I've got
all my makeup in front of me
I'm allowed to open my eyes to pick the
product up but as soon as I pick the
product up I've gotta close my eyes and
then go to town I know this video is a
little bit stupid but it's for
entertainment purposes only if you enjoy
it make sure you give it a thumbs up and
let's get straight into it so I'm gonna
start off by prepping my face with some
of the Mac prep and Prime I'm done that
was hot
now I always like to start off with my
eyebrows first now once I'll put this on
my face there is no opening my eyes
alright so here we go just gonna be
using the benefit precisely my brow
pencil and I'm gonna oh my god what am i
doing
I've just gotta feel when the natural
hairs are and trying going in I'm gonna
go for a more natural brow today now
when I get to the top part I'm gonna
kind of go down like that up just to get
like that arch I'm moving on to the next
one
fuck this is going to be a shitshow bean
day you have to keep on going just
you've got this you've got this B+ it's
not that hard to be positive oh my god I
still haven't opened my eyes obviously
that's against the rules don't break the
rules Michael okay oh my god I'm so
nervous to open my eyes up but I'm
pretty sure I've got like my energy
don't Orange okay opening
whoa not bad I did good
I'm pretty impressed with that um now
I've just got to fill them in a little
bit more with some brow powder fuck
after having your eyes closed
everything's blue now I'm going to be
taking the benefit of browsing a bracket
and oh my god I need to close it and
reopen it with my eyes closed
that's the powder side okay so I'm just
dipping that in and then oh no I can't
say I'm putting it on my lap so I can
easily pick it off okay let's go to town
so right now I'm just filling in where
my brow would normally guard it's not
working kind of pad aside
oh god this is actually terrifying just
looking it up at the front to get the
Naturals little book you know so moving
on to the side it's doing in the brow
you know it's gonna be the hardest part
about this is concealing my brows that
is going to be stop a shit show now
while I'm here I just like to brush my
brows I'll put it and make sure that
nice and in place till
that's not even that yes it is okay now
that I'm just gonna zoom you guys in so
you can see a little bit better
oh we don't want to get too close story
because this is gonna be an absolute
shit show in itself already
till now I'm gonna be taking the annoy
filter concealer from colour-pop and
placing this strategically under my brow
ready to conceal it oh my god okay now I
need to get oh my god guys I have to
open my eyes to get my flat brush I'm
not looking there okay I just looked
okay now going in with my flat brush and
concealing these brows ah fack just
going under the brow and under the arch
- okay nice oh gosh you know I bet if
nikkietutorials did this it would
literally look full lawless and then
you've got this Australian bush pig eye
over here attempting to do a good job
and it's just not working out for him oh
my god I don't know what you're doing
this situation anyway I'm just gonna
come on keep on tripping through this
come on I'm gonna drag this bowl I
thought my lid area as I normally would
okay just gonna wet my Beauty Blender
and then I'm just gonna go in and blend
out this concealer so it's ready to
guard for my eyeshadow I'm like hoping
this is gonna like look like semi okay
that's not so bad now I'm just gonna be
setting that in place it's quite easy
I'm gonna try and do a winged liner as
well because I will just be fun you know
what's going on here but we're looking
not too bad
moving into our shutter I'm gonna be
taking these soft glam palette from
Anastasia Beverly Hills Anastasia
Beverly Channel now I'm gonna be taking
a mixture of burnt orange and see you
know I don't have to look at this right
this is where I have to
I'm going in okay Michael okay sorry I'm
just gonna stop off by buffing this
through my crease as you can see and I'm
not gonna take it to your eye cuz I'd
are gonna lose my transition when I go
in with my talk of shades you know
I'm not ready for this moving on to the
next I just doing the exact same thing
till now I don't want to go too intense
with like black ice over everything
because that's obviously gonna make it
look like a fuckwit sorry I'm just going
to do these colors first and I'm gonna
bring this all the way into making a
corner I just gonna have hooded eyes
it's much better if you bring your
shadows into the inner corner when you
have four devices it make sure I feel
bigger and wider rather than smaller Wow
okay now I'm just gonna be taking a
clean fluffy blending brush to blend out
my harsh edges so I'm just gonna be
going over them I'm not taking any extra
product on this because it doesn't look
like I need it however it does look like
I live need a little bit more of the
Sienna so I'm just gonna go ahead and do
that on this line I okay that should be
good now I'm just gonna go back to my
clean blending brush and blend those
villains now a lot of people comment on
my videos who is bindi she's one of my
best friends I never really see her that
much and I texted her this morning she
was alright she's a little bit rude to
me sorry we haven't spoken for like a
few hours but hopefully she'll come
around tonight and send me a snap shot
this afternoon that people will only do
afterwards that being a little bit
standoffish and rude you know okay we
are looking fantastic now I need to do
my lid shade
sir i'ma take this shun EXO brush and
I'm just gonna switch scripts with my
brush with a little bit of mac fix+ and
I'm gonna go interview this palette is
absolutely fucked by the way because
it's smashed when I was traveling I just
gagged on a fixed class I'm just gonna
be taking some of this gold shade and
then I'm just going it should be placing
that on my eye that's sorry
and the exact same on this side now I
don't want to make this look bad like
I'm trying to make it look good yeah I
think it's time for a little bit of
liquid eyeliner just to make this look a
little bit more full glam for that I'm
gonna be taking the NYC a liquid liner
this is my favorite liquid liner in the
world and I'm just gonna be taking this
and take a nice big fuck-off wing as per
usual now this is a little bit
terrifying come on actually sir I'm just
gonna take a flake cut off and then I'm
going to be joining that up and across
the top of my lash line trying to keep
it really close I'm jet I have an idea I
have an idea I'm just gonna go ahead
enter this eye big flick kaboom and then
I'm just gonna join it up and go to
blame the lashes in when they go on as
well
that's pretty good I'm actually pretty
impressed with that okay sorry liquid
eyeliner is now done now what I'm gonna
do is I'm just gonna be taking my
Johnson and Johnson love a good Johnson
makeup wipe and I'm just going to be
cleaning up my wing let's talk about a
guru how would this cuz that's what's
gonna get coach oh my god guys oh shit I
need to clean up you know Oh am I gonna
have to look up doing this but I'm
actually technically not looking I don't
need to clean his eye off I don't think
but I do want to try and scratch off the
liquid liner that I've got here because
it transferred and that's our grade
that'll have to do going in with him a
scar so we're taking my too faced better
than dick hey mascara and I'm just going
to be popping this on my lashes now this
shouldn't be very hard
easy oh my god I just got it on of my
eyeshadow and everyone the look I've
ruined it I'm gonna wait for that to dry
before I attempt to get it off
afterwards you know No whilst I'm here
I'm actually just gonna go in and
conceal the tops on my brows it's got a
little bit of liquor on TV paint stick
is just sitting here so amazed I'll just
use it it's nice and thick might work
better than a liquid at this point in
time and I'm just going to conceal the
top of my brow it's gonna do one swipe
because I feel like that's gonna be like
the best effect oh my gosh
why don't you made a mistake you can't
clean it up because you can't see
yourself cleaning it off because you
don't know way to clean up camera do the
slide pop and oh my god
but now that I've concealed the tops of
my brows and this is the shit shot it's
gonna drown my Beauty Blender in 6
o'clock because I can't really getting
up I just ate a fucking burger I mean a
salad and unhealthy salad with croutons
and a lot of dressing and chicken and
pomazan Jake Kennedy calories now we
need to prime so for that I'm just gonna
be taking the Mac straight previous with

pallet clay play pilot pilot palette
shut up palette and I'm just gonna be
taking my zoeva 1 to 7 because and I'm
just gonna be dipping into this shade
here tall I'm just gonna be contrary I
can kind of feel where my face is like
with contouring it's a little bit easier
but I just don't know what it's gonna
look like so I can leave it a little bit
more in these cheeks
that's not bad either now I'm trying to
be contouring my nose a little bit just
with a little bit more powder where now
this is where it's gonna turn into a
shit show and a half so so you're taking
a little bit and joining it up to the

gonna add a little bit more contour to
the side of a nose I'm Fox I'm gonna
take this brush and try and blend this

bronze up to this look because it's just
not making the cut with the Physicians
Formula
saerom take some of global glow from Mac
we're gonna do like Diaz and we gonna do
like Diaz
it's kind of like a highlighter and a
bronzer in one I think it's actually
it's like a skin to finish I don't
actually think it's a bronzer but I've
been calling it a bronzer to the past
six months so let's just go with that
and use it as a bronzer well I will you
don't have to like to break the rules
with makeup so just like a flush is
gonna go on my eyes it's gonna go on my
fucking eyes I'm pretty impressed by my
skin for a little bit of blush I'm gonna
be taking my fav sweet page from Too
Faced and I'm just taking a little bit
of that anger brush forward just to make
a more natural sort of law how does that
look hello

dipping into that wing on dual ideas is
it like a fake does that look really
nice
sorry I'm just gonna be popping this
highlighter in the usual areas this was
quite an easy tasks to do with your eyes
closed because you know what I actually
have done my makeup when I was drunk
before when I was in New Zealand the
night that we went out went home and did
my glam that's in my New Zealand vlog
and I just looked it looked a mess but I
my eyes were basically half closed so
whatever just hit the Cupid's bow keep
its gentle oh my god I'm sorry beautiful

lashes and do my bottom mascara so I'm
just gonna be taking these ones that
I've got here from here idiot here these
are the Thera lashes so I don't play
around when it comes to lashes so I'm
just gonna pop some glue on and I am
gonna do it with my eyes closed I'm
going to attempt to yeah so make it fun
why don't I use a red lipstick seeing as
we've got like a black wing on why don't
I just do red rather than a nude because
that's just gonna be too easy
so I got the Fenty one here now I'm
gonna get not bad not bad I'm gonna get
back in and do my
oh my dear god I look like Ronald
McDonald Nestle fucking to fix this edge

like it like that now oh shit my last
chord is driving okay I'm just gonna
pick up my lash close my eye

merely impossible I love my life oh my
last year uh-oh
