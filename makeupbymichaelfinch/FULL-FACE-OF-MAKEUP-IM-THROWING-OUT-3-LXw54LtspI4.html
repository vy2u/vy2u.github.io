my god I'm so glad to be back filming
again for those three Darner I didn't
really speak much about it on my social
media because I just couldn't be
bothered saying I'm sick I can't I won't
be uploading I just didn't want people
to think that was an excuse as to why I
wasn't uploading so I have been sick for
the past five days I think I caught a
stomach bug when I was in Bali so I've
been waking up with migraines headaches
I've been shitting everywhere it hasn't
been fun it's been not fun fine not fun
but I woke up this morning and I feel so
much better and thank fuck because I
have to start fucking filming so today
is Monday and there is gonna be three
videos this week there's gonna be today
Wednesday and Friday and I'm gonna be
back into my three videos a week from
now on at the end of the week on
Thursday I'm actually going to Coachella
where Coachella Coachella got a dick hey
hey Coachella where the clip a so yes I
will be going to sugar seller and I'm so
excited for that I'm going with
beginning boutique sorry it's going to
be absolutely fantastic anyway as you
can tell from the title of today's video
it is going to be a full face of makeup
that I'm throwing out now please keep in
mind that I'm actually not throwing
these products literally in the bin I'm
putting them in a box for my friends or
family to go through it and take what
they want I never ever ever free make a
path unless it's broken or smashed or
anything like that so basically I'm just
gonna be doing the full face of makeup
as to why I'm throwing these products
out they might not work for me now if
you lack any of the products that I'm
using that's great I'm glad they work
for you I'm jealous don't come for me
just because I don't work for me sis you
know the drill with that hey-oh
as you can tell I'm feeling much better
anyway without any further ado let's get
straight into this video whoa
okay sir I don't actually have any brow
products that I don't lock and I'm not
just gonna include one for the sake of
the video so I'm just gonna go off
camera quickly filled them in and then
I'll be right back
alright browser all filled in now let's
move on to concealing them now that can
feel that I'm gonna be using today this
is the taut rainforest of the sea aqua
concealer can see a long aqua cielo can
feel a sorry til now I've had many
experiences with this it's just not full
coverage it is literally not full
coverage if you like a light concealer I
don't but if you like a light concealer
it's definitely the adult but the
consistency of it is literally like
water it's so thin and I just don't dig
it at all and I've used it once and
actually twice and this is gonna be the
last time I'm using it so I'm just going
and concealing under my brows best as I
can I just really like thick concealer
that's full coverage and this just
doesn't make this just doesn't do it for
me do you know what I mean all right I
just dream you guys in a little bit so
you can see a little bit better rather
than being so far away anyway I'm just
gonna take this concealer and pop it all
over my eyelid area and I'm gonna blend
it out with my Beauty Blender where
Beauty Blender where Beauty Blender
where Caitlin Jenner where hey hey hey
hey hey hey with a clip hey hey oh my
god Chris is coming at the end of the
month and I've never been more excited
in my fucking life oh my god I'm going
to shit everywhere as soon as he touches
down down on the dough now moving on to
eyeshadow and to set my base I'm gonna
be taking the I wanted all pallet from
Kylie cosmetics now Kylie get your
fucking shit together bitch seriously
you've got so much money it's a jerk
when I got this it was literally broken
my highlighter was broken and to be
honest these shadows a shit and they
don't really blend whatsoever I've used
it in one video before and I did mention
that they were patchy and they didn't
build up and they just blend it away
into literally nothing so shout out to
Kylie for making you spend $50 on this
piece of shit I'm just gonna go in with
the morphe m51 brush and take the shade
but a cream frosting just to set to
conceal art now just because this is a
full face of makeup I don't like I'm not
intentionally going to try and make
the makeup look bad I'm actually gonna
try and make it look somewhat you know
presentable so I could go out after this
if I want to change you not I mean but
on the other hand it's probably not
gonna happen so you can see that that
concealer didn't cover that little red
blemish that I've got under there when
it doesn't cover the red blemish it
means it needs to go in the bin because
it's not my sort of concealer moving
along I'm just gonna be dipping into the
shade called the new black which is this
pink shade yeah I'm just lightly dabbing
my brush in and as you can see there's a
lot of fallout but whatever all right
sir I'm just gonna be popping this into
my crease really Mike released bindi hi
bindi bindi bindi bindi getting a bitch
hey has anybody tried the weather
collection from Kylie because I haven't
the packaging is so fucking ugly and
it's just sour it just looks like
fucking take me back to the future maybe
they're good products but fucking shit
says fig yeah right so I'm just gonna
blend that up and blend it in okay it's
blended nicely to an extent I'm showing
two Guardian it with the shade called
party time up here dope and I'm also
just gonna be blending this into my
crease as well now that literally
doesn't show up whatsoever I'm just
gonna be wetting my brush with a little
bit of fix+ because it's only fair to do
that and I'm gonna dip into the shade
called
birthday girl up in the corner yeah I'm
just gonna pop the shade on my lid now
this shade is good how about shimmery
shades are quite easy to make it's the
mats that are harder to make like it
just doesn't appeal to me Oh like how
many looks can you do with this like I
said pink like smokey eye I don't know
each to their own bit I don't like it
speaking of kardashian-jenner makeup I
just bought Albany Kim K stuff so though
I should have palette the lipstick the
baking powder the concealer so I'm going
to be doing a four of you on that when I
get it in the mail hopefully before
Coachella but I have a gut feeling they
don't wanna be here before that removing
onto mascara I'm just gonna be taking
the tots lights camera lashes now I love
this mascara the reason why I'm throwing
it out is completely different to the
rest I'm throwing this out because I've
had it for too long and I'm pretty sure
you meant to replace your mascaras after
like six months and I've had this for
like two years so shouldn't really be
applying this to my
right now but this is the last time and
it's going in zbn gelling in zbn it's a
little bit dried out as well because
I've had it for so long
okay moving on to the face I'm going to
be taking the Tarte clean slate flawless
12 hour brightening primer to me this
just doesn't make my foundation stick
any better to my face then it would
without of primer and it's kind of just
like a moisturizer in my opinion yeah it
just doesn't do much for me with primers
it's kind of hard to tell if they're
actually work but my favorite ones like
oh you use is definitely the benefit
Porefessional in the matte rescue
because you can tell that it's sticky
and it's tacky however with this it's
just kind of lack in do you know what I
mean
alright and by the way would it really
be a michael finch video without a
missing now getting them done next week
of Coachella where hey Coachella where
if I say Coachella one more time in this
video please end me Oh before I do move
on to the face I do have this other
palette that I've actually never used
just because it doesn't appeal to me
whatsoever this is the Too Faced glitter
bomb palette never used it but the
reason while I'm throwing it out is
because I would never I would never ever
ever use this like what okay so I'm just
going to where the fuck is a flat shader
brush seriously I can never find
anything these days bendy why it's hard
I'm just gonna dip into the shake here
called rose' all day and maybe you meant
to put this brightening base down No
okay well that is a powder I thought it
was a liquid so it's only fair to spray
my brush with a little bit of fix+
then I'm gonna go into the shade rose'
all day and see if this is any better
are you meant to use like glitter glue
with this or some shit like I don't get
it
I'm very impressed it just doesn't
appeal to me this eyeshadow palette like
literally it's the murse like on
versatile palette I think I've ever seen
okay moving on to foundation I'm gonna
be taking the kat von dick locket
Foundation I've used this once and it's
just sorry like thick and patchy and
hard to blend in my opinion this is in
the shade light neutral I'm just going
to squirt someone to the back of my hand
mind you this is not my color it's a
little bit too light for me but we're
just gonna go with it anyway for this
like this is literally cast with a
little fucking ghost bitch like what the
fuck the other reason while I'm throwing
it out is because it's not my color at
all okay I'm just gonna go ahead and
apply this and I'll be right back it
might take a while
each time you try and go over and blend
my foundation around the foundation
that's already gone down it literally
just comes off like I don't know if it's
the Beautyblender but I use beauty
blenders for like every other foundation
and I have no troubles whatsoever like
seeing how that's just taking it all off
my nose just that okay now that I'm
looking like Casper the actual fucking
guys I'm like I've got a flirting head
flashback Mary is that you love you
James
okay just doesn't want to blend nicely
bindi okay why don't we move on to
concealer to make this look even better
I'm gonna be going back in with the aqua
concealer that's actually darker than my
actual foundation which is completely
normal and I'm just gonna be popping
that underneath my eyes now this is
where I start to get a little bit angry
within the video because the products
are just sorry fucking annoying that I
just generally get pissed off cuz it
sucks you know you spend your money on
these things and they just don't work
and then you feel like shit you can't
get a refund you know what I mean so now
that I've concealed I'm just gonna go in
and blend out this conceal a lot on okay
so where I've actually put that
concealer it's just completely taken off
the foundation and left a red mark let's
keep going oh it's definitely taking it
right off my nose it literally just took
the foundation right off my nose and the
concealer disappeared into nothing this
is what I'm talking about you guys like
what the fuck is going on I'm just gonna
blend it into my under eyes and I just
want to call this a day because this is
not okay that rhymed hey hey hey
okay send my foundation is literally
coming off almost everywhere where I put
the concealer okay now to make this look
even better I'm gonna be taking one of
my favorite powders ever this is the Too
Faced Born This Way setting powder I
fucking hate this shit it is so yellow
and just it's gross like a lot of people
love it I'm glad it works too you bought
for me straight in the literal bin I
said at the start of this video that I'm
not actually throwing any of these
products out besides my mascara but I'm
actually gonna throw this one out
because I don't
any my friends using it I'm sorry I just
despise it sorry it's literally the
shade of banana powder and even when I
like try to use this as like a
foundation that suits me and Mike you
know the tight shape tape and whatnot it
literally makes your under eyes Yeller
and if you inhale it
oh fucking hood just keep going keep
going just see what I'm trying all this
makeup out Geoff's e just gonna bake
where I put all the concealer as well
fuck I just throw it all over my Javon
cheese Javon Chee socially just taking
off all the concealer under here whether
it's the foundation the concealer the
powder I don't know they're all shit
sorry that I'm such a savage like
whatever I'm just gonna use that yellow
powder
banana powder to set the rest of my
little face fucking dog dog licker oh
shit I forgot to use these radiance
drops from title so these are the
rainforest of the sea drops I don't know
if these are meant to be like for your
highlighter or whatever but I've just
baked but literally it's just clear
liquid back it's literally clear liquid
like it's not what's it meant to do okay
moving on to contouring and bronzing I
don't actually have a contour powder
that I don't like at the moment I've
pretty much thrown them all out
sorry honestly going on with this bronze
off from astralis it's just too shimmery
for my lacking so I'm just gonna be
bronzing up my face with this you know
just to use not gonna lie this does with
worse because I have such a pale
foundation on just going to fucking dog
alright well that's absolutely turned to
shit if that wasn't intentional by the
way fucking people trying to come for me
staying up I'm trying to make it look
bad no it just doesn't blend gel it just
doesn't blend alright anyway I will
continue bronzing up my forehead anyway
and may as well get this makeup look at
nice and complete because I'm ready to
hit the fucking clubs I'm telling you
right now
okay now that I'm Oberon's for the
absolute gods lets me country that
fuck's going on moving on to blush I'm
gonna be taking this one from Too Faced
this is their blush in the shade justify
my love the reason while I'm throwing
this blush art is because of the color
it is fucking pure pink and pure pink
blushes do not suit me nothing I don't
like about the product itself it's just
the color or yeah I'm just gonna be
popping this on okay I swear to God I
did not try and make that look bad I'm
gonna try and blend it out a little bit
more I swear this is not a hate video
against heart or to face but fuck me
moving on to my highlighter I'm gonna be
taking this one from Todd this is the
spellbound glory it's like a rainbow
highlighter I just
Bram bear highlight isn't me just
they're not my friend you know what I
mean like I'd rather just you know
champagne fucking pop or fucking pop
your pussy like one like what but I'm
just gonna be dipping into this rainbow
rock but oh it's making me gag and I'm
just gonna be popping this onto my
cheeks now sometimes highlighters I
fucking love there's some of the best
products ever and I'm not only saying
that they've already keeps me off their
PR lists I mean that does actually look
too bad but it's just not a highlighter
that I would go for like in my makeup
tour if I was to see it I'd be like oh
do you not I mean like anyway regardless
it's still going in the bin don't even
sticking to my foundation because my
foundation is so chopped now last but
not least moving on to lipstick I'm
gonna be taking the Kat Von D studded
kiss cream lipstick in the shade plant
nan now the reason why I'm throwing this
out is because just watch need i say
more
I mean like it's actually a pretty cool
color and like kind of fun and different
but I just never see myself using this
for anything ever
anyway this brings us to the end of
today's video i hope you guys somewhat
enjoyed it and got some entertainment
out of it as i said before this is not
like a hate video well like to an extent
