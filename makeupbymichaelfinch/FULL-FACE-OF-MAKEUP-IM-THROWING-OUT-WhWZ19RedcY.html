channel so today I'm gonna be doing
another full face video because I love
these videos so much so I'm gonna be
doing a full face of makeup that I'm
throwing out so pretty much everything
that I'm gonna be using in this video
I'm not actually throwing out I'm just
gonna be giving it to a friend or a
family member or donating it to someone
or somewhere the makeup that I'm gonna
be using today is just stuff that I
don't use anymore or something better
has come out or the products that I'm
using I just don't see a point in if
you're on you here and you haven't
subscribed already please make sure you
do before you leave and let's get
straight into this video
so for my brows today the first product
I'm gonna be using is the anastasia
beverly hills dipbrow pomade in the
shade blonde
i used to use this when I was a lot
younger like when I first started makeup
like earning and uh Nastasia product was
like everything to me back then but now
it's completely dried out and I've been
through a few of these and I just found
better products and I literally just
don't reach for it anymore benefit is
where my brows are at it's like sorry
like thick like it's not completely
dried up but it's just so friggin thick
like I like something that like glads to
the brows so I'm just gonna go ahead and
do my brows how I would normally it'd do
them and I'm just gonna kind of brush it
for the front of my brow this isn't a
bad product this isn't products I hate
it's just stuff that I just darn use
anymore and I just Mike declutter and
get the out of here just gonna give
my brows a brush so in these products
that I am using today are ones that I
generally like don't lock and they need
to go so could do it in like a full face
the products I hate but I don't have
enough so I'm just gonna go with this
 seal and she can seal my brows
today I'm just gonna be taking these
Sephora bright future concealer this is
like a gel concealer and it just didn't
do anything for me last time I used it I
don't even think I ended up using it in
the rest of the video I just literally
got rid of that and ended up using
probably my top shape tape but I'm gonna
use this today first of all the diaper
applicators absolutely cooked off its
chops and it does not get like enough
product out like literally it doesn't
get like you have to dip into a million
times like so many times and you know
would consider I use a lot so I can't be
 going in and out a
million times to get the right amount of
concealer however you might like
this concealer if you like it like a
really light coverage concealer and then
just gonna take that concealer over my
lid and I'm gonna be using this as like
a base today oh God
oh gosh I'm still taking my damp beauty
blender and blend this concealer out
just set my concealer in place I'm just
gonna be taking this compact here from
Giovanna sheen and to be honest the
reason mind checking snapped because it
literally does nothing for me it
literally does nothing it's meant to
like naturally contour and highlight the
face but literally it does
fuck-all so I'm just gonna take a little
bit
is powder and I'm just gonna set over my
lids just to set it in place
kind of disappointing to cuz John she's
so expensive and when you get a product
like this that literally does bumfuck or
you're like okay well that's a problem
and I've had enough
moving on to eyeshadow I'm gonna be
taking the kylie jenner the bronze
palette now to be honest overrated
there's much better things out there
you're only paying for the name so I'm
just gonna be dipping into the Kylie
bronze palette and I probably only use
this literally twice in my whole
lifetime maybe even once I'm just gonna
take the bone shade from up the top and
I'm just gonna pop that under here Kylie
cosmetics all that is literally
done in the same Factory as
color pot and I mean there's a lot of
speculation about it but you know I've
spoken to a lot of people in that
industry industry and ha like literally
you see Kylie's new concealers and the
packaging is like identical to the color
pop concealers so when I've actually got
a buyer Kylie concealer if I get my
hands on one in time I'm going to do a
video on color pop versus Kylie to see
the difference if there is one there
probably isn't there's really enough
proof that all those ships made in color
pops Factory anyway moving on I'm gonna
take this orange shade in the middle and
I'm just gonna pop this through my
crease you know what when this first
when this palette first came out I was
like obsessed and I'm like oh my god
Kylie um but it was just like the whole
like when Kylie was fence at the first
announcing that she's coming out with
lip products the whole internet went
into a frenzy was like holy
like Kylie's lips are the bomb like
everyone wants kylie jenner lips but now
like the the craze is kind of over and
I'm just like yeah these shadows like
they're not bad like the liquid blend
ability and like you can really build
these shutters off but to be honest this
stuff better and cheaper and now I'm
just gonna be taking some of the shade
all right here and I'm just gonna blend
this through the crease just to kind of
deepen all up a little bit and I'm also
gonna pick up a little bit of this jakka
brand yeah oh and by the way shout out
to Kali Cosmetics I ordered a
purple palette when I first came out and
I still haven't got it sorry I
messaged the customer service and I was
like
it's being like literally like two
months three months since I ordered the
pallet and it still hasn't calm and they
were like no worries send us short order
number and all that and I went through
all my emails and I literally can't find
my order number anywhere and I'm like
come on like surely there's a way you
can track it through PayPal because I
paid on PayPal I'm like slow there's a
way you can track it through PayPal and
ever since then I haven't heard back so
I'm really angry about that because it
was like I ordered like the purple
pallet and a liquid lipstick like one of
the new ones and I still haven't
got it and now I don't even really want
it anymore to be honest so battery's
dying guys hold up right something takes
mr. black from the Cali pallet in the
corner here I'm just gonna pop it onto
the out of the-- and just kind of blend
it in just so we have a little bit of
dimension going on and then I'm just
gonna take some more of the brown shade
that I used before just to blend out
that black a little bit alright sorry
for my eyelid I'm just gonna be taking V
a Natasha Turner primer crystal top card
now the reason why I don't really want
to use this anymore and I'm going to be
clearing all the shades out of my
cupboard is because they're just
literally so texturising and like when
you try and do a winged liner with them
it just goes so bumpy and it's tragic
it's a show it's a mess it's a
fest they might work good for some
people but for me they just don't work
okay Oh call me Khloe Kardashian ooh it
this is in the shade nude nude over my
lid like it's a really pretty color and
everything I just don't like it's a
formula and I'm probably never gonna
reach for these again and as soon as
they leave like the little pot they got
quite dry also which is kind of annoying
it's a really pretty color and you know
I can make it work but it's not worth
the time of around with like
chunks of glitter on your lid with a
liquid eyeliner you know what I mean
looks really good in the pot but what
soon as it's on the eye completely
different I'm just gonna blend around
the edges of that that I just put
down just to make sure it's nice and
seamless to it okay guys so moving on to
liquid eyeliner I'm gonna be taking the
Mac roller wheel liquid liner now to be
honest I've never tried this before and
I don't want to but I'm going to I just
don't it looks like a pizza
so basically it's a liquid liner but
it's on a wheel and you've got a girl I
guess um like this I mean this could be
good but it just looks annoying like it
just annoys me just like looking at it
pisses me off because like I don't
understand it so I'm just gonna try and
do a wing so bear with me on this Oh God
holy okay how the am I meant
to get a fine point with this had enough
already
Oh oh my god
how is this a thing do people actually
buy this when it came out holy this
is a mess what the dick for real
burn this is a waste of money it doesn't
allow you to get a nice point it just
 chops it off like a big chop
chop and it's so hard I'm scared I'm
gonna cut my eyelid open feels a
little bit sharp this is the dumbest
thing I've ever seen like this is
ridiculous oh holy that is going in
the bin I'm not even gonna give
this to anyone because it's a piece of
 waste of money though like who is
organizing max makeup that comes out
because you need a reality check on
that's not good that's a waste of time
okay moving on to the face I'm gonna be
taking the facade unicorn essence I just
don't see the big hype about this you
guys like it smells incredible
it's pink it looks Gorge but like I just
don't understand the hype around it the
only thing I like about this is the
smell it's just like overrated unlike
I'm never gonna reach for it because I
like primers that I'd like to think this
is just like very like thin I guess I
thought this was when I was in America
and it was like 50 Australian 51 or
something Australian dollars where's the
money bird but I guess that's what
makeup is about you know testing it like
this is my job like I buy makeup test it
out and then review it for you guys and
you guys know my thoughts sorry so J
sorry for foundation I'm going to be
using the Fenty of beauty foundation
this is in the shade per quick filter
this isn't a shade 120 120 okay now the
reason why I'm never gonna reach for
this again is because it dries way too
fast on my liking and it goes so
incredibly matte so if you have dry skin
do not go near this ever because you
don't even need a powder to set it just
goes that map
and it dries too quick so it's gonna
squirt them onto the back of my hair and
imma show you guys what I'm talking
about
so this is what I normally do with my
foundation right I just daughter all
over my face oh and I can't forget this
 oxidizes like a it's
normal for foundations to oxidize a bit
but this oxidizes so quickly and to a
completely different color right so
that's how I normally do my foundation
you guys know this and then I take my I
leave my forehead cuz I do it after cuz
I don't want it to dry and I take a
little bit of the foundation on the
Beauty Blender and then I just stopped
lending it all in all right now I don't
know if you can see but already where
I've painted that foundation it's less
like a mop like from the line where I
put it in so you have to work quick with
it and I like to take my time with
makeup I don't like to be rushed
whatsoever otherwise I freak out and
just my makeup turns into a show um
and like it's amazing coverage and
everything but the fact that it dries
like see what I mean like I'm just
blending over that like any normal
foundation that would blend out but it's
just not and you literally have to like
drag to get rid of those lines like it's
just it's just a show alright so
I'm just blending over this like I
normally would with any foundation and
this is the result that I'm getting do
you see what I mean like oh it's just
sorry irritating why does it dry so
quickly soon as it's out of that bottle
it's like the Saharan desert
it's dry it's I've had enough
drop my mail to spend the next hour
trying to blend this out finally
got this blended to an extent was gonna
take a bit more and try and build up
coverage but I'm gonna work quick
because that's how you have to work
quick with it why would you want to work
quick with a foundation boat take your
time alright so I'm just gonna take that
senti Beauty looking ass foundation and
I'm just gonna try and conceal the top
of my brows I'm not trying to make this
makeup look bad like the eye line is
generally a show alright so guys
I'm just gonna do my forehead as I
normally would give me like half an hour
just to get always blend it out there's
a brawl a Beauty Blender around
like these to try and get rid of all the
 lines do you see what I mean
like nah right Nora Nora Nora Nora it's
a knife from me
if this foundation didn't dry so fast I
would be in love with it cuz I have the
oily skin type and I feel like it's
literally not gonna move at all
throughout the day so now it's a
highlight under my eyes I'm just gonna
be taking the once again a fancy Beauty
highlight stick so this is meant to be
used
under your eyes apparently these colors
a little bit off my color well it
definitely is but it's just so drying
you guys like it's SAR drying it's just
uncomfortable to wear and it's
uncomfortable to look at and it's also
uncomfortable to put on so I'm just
gonna pop this under my eyes my nose
bridge forehead chin keep it yes can't
forget me keep EE not that you can be
these big fuck-off juicy off
sausage lips head this also dries really
quick too and as you can see where I've
just put up on my nose it's like taking
off the foundation underneath it and now
it's just completely routed this is
cooks this is off chops this is a
show fest and I've had enough it
really shows up all your pores as well
which is another thing I don't like
about it it literally sinks into your
paws now she baked my undereyes I'm just
gonna be taking the la girl pro powder
look this is just so finely milled it's
an absolute joke and the flashback is
through the roof so I'm just gonna dip
my booty looking at blender into that oh
my god I just inhaled it holy you
guys I fully just inhaled this so much
all right sir I'm dabbing over the rest
of my face this is what I would normally
do with any other powder or foundation
or anything and it's literally taking
off the stuff underneath and like
sinking into my pores and just like
scraping off the top layer oh my god
this is a shower and a half I've
said it once and I'll say it again it's
a show okay so moving on from that
translucent powder and then just gonna
be taking the hourglass ambient lighting
palette I thought this is a highlighter
but it turns out it's not it's for your
face and it's meant to give it a nice
 glow so I've used this before
and it literally does nothing to my skin
maybe because I you know take on powder
foundation so much is that a blush I'll
be putting it on my face anyway it just
doesn't do anything for me like it
doesn't show up like if you if you like
a flush of you know glowy skin over the
top and this is perfect for you oh my
god this is this my skin has never
looked more rank it looks like I'm
 doing like the makeup in Reverse
or some like that
so I just don't see the point in this
for somebody like me and that's why it's
going and it doesn't do
all to my skin now moving back on to
contouring this Givenchy compact says
contour unify highlights and contours
naturally okay so I'm assuming this
shade here is the contour shade let's
give it a whirl
I'm just gonna take my favorite
contouring brush morphe r14 and we're
gonna do some contouring
oh that's sorry pigmented Wow incredible
phenomenal laughs changing you guys need
to see a closeup of my face I'll do it
afterwards you guys will actually gag
and everywhere cuz it's Fox we're
actually not showing up anything on my
face maybe like the tiniest little bit
there's a little something happening
there but I think that's just my cheek
fella anyway I'm just gonna try and
contour my job that anything's coming
out but you know these products we're
gonna try me out okay now that I'm
freshly con to it let's move on to
highlighter I don't actually have a
blush that I don't lack or I'm throwing
out because all blushes tamiya pretty
much the same unless it's a liquid blush
but that's a whole new story and if you
want my face to turn into like an actual
donkey to pinata and throughout
then I'm not gonna put any liquids on
this right now
so for highlighter today I'm just gonna
be taking the LA girls strobe light
strobing powder I don't know how people
make this look good like I've seen
people post with this on Instagram and
it looks re blinding and even in videos
but to me it's just a big clump of
powder in a dozen so I'm going to take
that morphe g37 brush which is really
good for highlighting if you like a
really intense highlight so it should
pick up a lot of product and I'm going
over my skin and like nothing comes out
like I'm sure if you were to spray your
face with like some fix+ or something
like that
and then spray it it would work but I
can just to show you it so it's gonna go
patchy AF where is my fix + anyway I
can't find the fix + but this is the
highlighter right it should just be
highlighting a straight away literally
does fuck-all maybe does a little bit to
the tip of my nose but on the cheek it's
like by I'm not interested I just don't
like how much you have to layer it up
and it does go really patchy
when you were planning I like a
highlight just go straight on intense
pigment or fraud you know what I mean
like not this had enough okay so moving
on to mascara I'm just gonna be taking
the gray lane I'm pretty sure I said
that correctly this was sent to me in PR
I did not purchase this doesn't mean I'm
not gonna talk about it I just
think it's just for the price point
there
it is I just think it's just pointless
like it's got a little ball on the end
which allows you to get right up in
there and like comparing this to like
the roller lash from benefit or the true
face better than dick sacks
it is literally a waste of money
and now last but not least my lips today
I'm just gonna be using the Too Faced
melted a latex by shine at lipstick the
reason why I do not like this formula at
all is because it's so sticky
I understand it's meant to be a harsh
line but you still can get high shine
without having that stickiness melted
latex that just sounds like a show
waiting to happen like I used to work
with latex when I was younger and I used
to do like like a little bit of
prosthetic stuff and all that before I
got into like glamour like the glamour
side of makeup glamor yet right right
now and latex is just the stickiest like
robbery is most uncomfortable thing they
are super super pigmented but I just do
not like the formula whatsoever okay you
guys sir this is pretty much the
finished look I don't have any setting
sprays or anything that I want to throw
out because all setting sprays are
pretty much good for me besides the
L'Oreal long but that was a few videos
ago oh my god just even rubbing this
together it's like hard it's like a it's
like a workout so guys this is a
close-up of the makeup the lighting in
here is kind of like getting rid of all
like the nasty things it does look not
good anyway this is the end of today's
video I hope you guys really enjoyed it
if you have any more full-face request
videos that you guys want to see let me
know in the comments down below don't
forget to subscribe before you leave and
I will see you all in my next video bye
