today I'm going to be doing the makeup
challenge in Reverse now I know a lot of
you guys have requested me to do this I
honestly don't really see the point in
this challenge to be honest it doesn't
really make sense to me but I feel like
it's gonna be a lot of fun so hence why
I'm gonna do it anyway
okay so let's get straight into it so
basically the makeup challenge in
Reverse is literally doing your makeup
in Reverse so primer goes last so it's
getting spray goes first last see I'm
already confusing myself so the first
thing I need to do is I need to set my
face so I'm just gonna take the Kat Von
D look at setting spray and just set my
whole thing yeah this honestly feels so
weird like I literally oh my god the
next step is lips are you
serious okay so our next step is lips
and I'm gonna be using mannequin by
Jeffrey star sorry umm lips is next so
I'm just going to and I actually want
really much fibers it's like actual to
try make it work but I don't know if
it's gonna got lipstick all over my
teeth that don't made me live one and
doormats are you or you maybe that speak
haha and you look like a junk
you look like a donkey up in Jana
and throw up back okay now that my lips
are all done and complete let's move on
to the next step which is I've actually
got it written in my notes on my phone
or typical who's that they're down you
see hey de Canas are you kidding
me
the next step that I've got to do is
highlight up so for my highlight today
I'm just going to take you a topaz
highlighter now because I really want my
highlighter pop I'm just going to spray
some mac fix+ on the brush I don't see
the point in all these steps leading up
to foundation because honestly
foundation will just cover it the
up like are you serious
anyway so I'm just going to highlight is
actually kind of stunning we talked to
my skin call but how good do I look
thank you very serious oh my god now the
next step is a blush so I'm just going
to apply a generous amount onto my
cheeks because I really want this to
shine through the foundations you not I
mean
so this blush is tight true love so I'm
just going to pop out on my cheeks and I
really want this to be super pigmented
because I really wanted to show up
through the foundation
I'm going to be putting all over the top
of everything anyway I feel like I look
stunning this is literally the dumbest
challenge I've ever done like isn't it
just obvious the foundation is going to
cover everything up anyway how to go
back yeah boys you guys know what
happens in a while I mean anyway moving
on to bronzer this is the Aversa tile
matte bronzer from all for that and I'm
just gonna take this big fluffy brush
and just runs up my skin a little bit
well I'm actually not joking can you
shut your trap
thank you I'm actually just bronzing up
my forehead a little bit because this
needs to shine through the foundation
everything right don't you know I'm
paying now to contour my face today I'm
just going to be taking me benefit hoola
bronzer and I'm just going to take this
on can you shut the up okay so I'm
just going to start contouring can you
shut your trap I'm just going to
start contouring my cheekbones this is a
look this is a stunning look of what it
is okay guys so now it is time for my
lashes perform a scar I know a lot of
people do that in general but I've
actually never done that before so
today's gonna be a first okay guys now
that my lashes are all stuck on it's
time to move on to Scott okay okay
so I'm just going to be using the other
Decay perversion mascara and this is
actually the first time is putting
lashes on first and then doing mascara
half-twist
what I can say is I definitely prefer to
put mascara on before lashes because
this is suck trying to get all my blonde
hairs not gonna happen let's
move on to something more exciting cuz
that part was okay guys next part
is my eyeliner so we're going to just be
using the mail or cosmetics gel liner or
my favorite line ever now I don't see
this being too much of a hassle this
part but I feel like the lashes are
getting in the way when I try and do me
wing so I'm just gonna oh that was
really intense that's right I got this I
got this
oh oh
all good all good that's a big
wing and I'm just gonna see if I can
create over my lashes yeah again cool oh
my god that wing is actually so
nice okay so now I'm just going to do
this thing and try and get it as even as
possible don't know how it's going to go
though this brush is so good to do
wing liner
what is it RC Cosmetics it's just a like
a pink white if I need in an angled
brush that I used to use that are
normally use I mean such as I suppose
 the right on and get up over
your lashes it just doesn't work so
you've got to like turn to the
inside and get your brush oh
these wings are actually stunning okay
guys now I'm going to move on to
concealer this is the Maybelline master
conceal and honestly this is where it's
all going to go downhill from here like
you think this is bad wait so I'm just
going to take the concealer and just pop
it over my eye I'm just going to avoid
the wing because I feel like I could
really master this look and then instead
of using a Beauty Blender today I'm
actually just going to use this a brush
here and just pop over that oh my god
it's going everywhere it's all over my
wing my wings already okay
bubbling is a fact I've got concealer
all over em so I Peter those wings
okay guys moving on to foundation this
is the bottomless way foundation in the
shade honey I am ten at the moment so
I'm going to be matching it to my turn
you know I'm saying so I'm just going to
squirt a little bit of this on the back
of my hand
it's extremely dark so because I'm tan
at home sorry now I guess I just drew my
foundation how I do any other day well I
can I could avoid my lips I normally go
over my lips but this back ah
ah ah oh my god I've managed to avoid my
lip so now I'm just going to go over the
rest this literally looks like a baby
poo color but it matches my turn so bad
so I'm literally just painting over all
the hard work that I just did are
you cooked as so covering up everything
that I've just done oh I was
meant to do concealer before foundation
yeah my whole anyway we're just
going to ignore that
boy I've sucking computer out of
myself I'm just going to blend out my
foundation with this sponge oh we're
going seriously this are odd of
honestly this challenge up so much
but technically I thought on stuff back
to I've technically still done a back
for fun so all the haters can eat my
asshole
I literally give up on this so I was
actually meant to set my eyelids first
before applying concealer it's gonna
take my Cody Asche on and just I
literally have fun this challenge
shot look at me okay I'm just going to
do my eyeshadow now because this
challenge is cooked in the
arsehole
so I'm just going to put my Kylie Jenner
burgundy palette all through my crease I
was literally I was I literally got that
carried away I thought I thought I was
meant to person through this last but I
would mention drew this first and then
go over with boy I can fix this
challenge
so that's it's so hard okay guys
so I'm gonna fix this challenge I've
just cooked it but I'm gonna unhook it
so I'm just going to set my lids like I
normally would and then I like to go
over my eyeshadow with concealer which
is what I was meant to do now not at the
start so I'm just going to set
everything with the concealer well
that's just covered up on my
shadow are you serious who requested for
me to do this video a lot of people to
hid why though why though
now I'm going to take more Cody s done
and I'm actually just going to bake my
face before concealing and I'm just
going to bake under the tree because I
feel like it needs that a little bit of
breakage under there look this
challenges is confusing the out of
me that's why I was scared to do it cuz
I knew something would go wrong I've got
someone here to help me because I don't
know what the fuck's going on back okay

normally would I'm just going to take
that on this here I bake under my eyes
I'm just going to bake on in my eyes
before I can feel little do this eyes
already so I just have to bake that
and then I'm just going to take my
sponge and blend all of my concealer out
