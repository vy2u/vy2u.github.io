channel so you guys have requested for
me to do a full face using a boiled egg
now this is my second time filming this
video because I tried it yesterday and
it was just that fact that I just gave
up like trying to do the eyeshadow the
egg was falling apart my acrylics we're
digging into the egg because I'm trying
to hold it and blend it and it just
wasn't working so um you guys still want
to see it so I'm just going to do it and
hope for the best
I don't know what it's going to look
like I've already done my brows because
literally impossible literally
impossible so the brows I've
already done them so let's just get
started on everything else and pray for
me because I'm going to need it and my
face is going to be a massive fest
after I've done this video so thank you
okay so we're going to start off with
face first today because I did my eye
first yesterday when I tried it filming
this for the first time and your two
 so let's just start off with the
face first so I'm just going to start
with a little bit of six-plus like I
always do for my foundation today I'm
going to be using the cover all wet and
wild cream foundation no point using a
high-end foundation because this shit's
coming straight off my face afterwards
and if you are watching this video
please do not take it seriously it's for
entertainment purposes only think so I'm
just going to squirt some of this out oh
 I didn't even prime mother of dick
okay so I'm just going to take some LA
girl Pro and prime primer and just pop
that all over my big old jolly fat head
thank you now just going to take my
boiled egg right here I'm sorry but eggs
don't smell good at all and I'm just
going to start I had a little bit of 5
o'clock shadow already I know it's not
even 5 o'clock yet bye if this starts
grating my if my beard or my stubble
starts grating this egg off on my face
I'm actually gonna vomit on everyone so
pray that it doesn't okey-doke
diddly-squat lady now just taking my a
boiled egg aka Beauty Blender I'm just
going to pop oh my god it looks so dodgy
okay I'm just going to grab my egg and
I'm just going to go straight in there
like that straight on and then just go
straight in and pray honest to god it's
not even blending and it's just
sitting all on top of my skin by oh well
let's just keep on
tripping up through this whole video and
see how we go okay so I have a feeling
is actually coming off on my face that
is disgusting
hi what's your foundation color today um
it's just a wet and wild foundation with
a little hint of egg yeah I make myself
sick honestly I'm just going to keep
blending the in now I saw some girl
on Instagram do this and it looked
flawless bitch did you cheat because
what the fuck's this application gone
okay now I'm just going to get it into
my nose I feel like if you push it into
your paws first I know that sounds gross
and then just like dab over the top
works somewhat better honestly that
listen it is ready it sounds
horrible thank you get in there bindi so
I'm just going to run over the
foundation a very put on there just to
see if I can blend it a little bit
better I swear that is all egg like
scaled across mask
oh my god it's chunky egg that's mixing
mixed in with the foundation mixed in
Nek minnit oh my god is that a chunk of
egg the eggs literally mixing in with
this foundation you joking me
bindi this is taking forever literally
there's a eyelash on my egg get
off you're not invited to the party
leave doors right there thank you it's
gonna rip my hair back because
I'm probably gonna get egg you'll all in
it anyway let's just get straight
started on the floor head home so I'm
just going to take my boiled egg and
just get it all through my hair by the
looks of things and just keep dabbing
okie dokie honestly the biggest 4g ship
first ever done on my face okay so once
your foundation is all done it looks
that gross anyway I'm moving on to
concealer let's use the let's just use
the top shape tape cause Yolo bit there
 there but on there there too okay
grab the egg and just start blending
this in you have got to be me in
the ass
alright by the looks of things were just
going to put concealer over my whole
nose because the foundation did not
cling to work with this egg okay
once that's all blended and I'm just
gonna pop some concealer under my eyes
and I'm just going to put a little bit
on top as well just to prep for the
shadow that we're about to do you know
now just take your egg and go to town oh
my god what is my life I wonder if this
is good for your skin like you know
using an egg to do this um by the way I
only just found out that an egg is a
chicken's period how is that come
on concealer it just sits on top of your
pores that is rank a s not going to lie
though it's actually blended that
concealer out quite well just not the
sound Italy nation there's little bits
of egg all over my face and my hand
hurts from holding that mother of dick
okay now I'm just going to take the new
a benefit contour stick we can do a
little bit of contouring to see how this
blends you know so I'm going to go like
this luckiest luckiest and luckiest and
then what I'm going to do is just go to
town once again I feel like this was the
worst decision I'd add that may to do
cream contouring because it's going to
take probably average three and a half
four hours to blend this all out great
ah land
seems that this a benefit product is
ship because it's not it's honestly just
a egg that's doing it and
there's little bits of flaky egg that is
a chunk of egg not a flake that's the
chunk that is disgusting that is gross
okay but it is actually blending it out
quite well that egg needs to get off my
 head now oh my god this egg is
like up so just sat here with my
eggs were a decent five minutes I don't
want anyone trying to read me in the
comments saying you went off camera and
use the Beauty Blender I'd be cheating
myself in the video would not be fun
 I do not do that I promise but I
just can't shut the up bhindi who
is that
oh my god it's bindi hey Ben Ben's
texting me anyway as I said I've just
been sitting here blending this for days
and it was the worst decision ever to do
some cream contouring Mon doing a
 egg challenge oh my god there's
still flakes of eggs everywhere I'm just
going to like get this off somehow
get off my face okay so now to
bake my undereyes and just like where I
use the concealer take a
a bit of airspun which is my trusted
best friend right here so I'm going to
dip my egg into that and just straight
under what picks up powder really well
probably cuz it's wet well like not wet
but it's like a damp cold I don't know
whether you guys fingers picking it oh
well not that I'm going to be
incorporating an egg into my everyday
life routine but I mean you know it's
doing the bits doing a good job now just
you know take your egg and
straight under your eyes okay I'm also
just going to do a little bit he will be
here a little bit here and a little bit
here good yeah I'm just going to let
that bake for a little bit in the
meantime I'm just going to set the rest
the rest of my foundation and I'm just
going to grab my egg and a bit of the I
don't want to this up its going to
get egg oil in it
 that I'm actually not going to use
that because I'm not out my new
fresh and flawless breast powder
I'm just going to take the Kody and just
kind of just like all over the face you
know kind of baked the whole face
because the loose powder is easier to
use rather than a press the powder
digging an egg into a press powder like
who wants to dig a get into pressed
powder and just stop back there up here
up there okay so why oh my god I did not
set my lids and they've creased
tremendously I just went to use my
finger then okay I'm just going to get
these creases out of my eyes oh no how
am I going to contour with a egg
I'm not dipping my egg into this well it
looks like I'm going to have to so I'm
just going to take my cool out light

top layer off later okay so I've got
some cool alight and I'm just going to
