today I'm going to be doing as the full
face using only beauty blenders now
meaning only beauty blenders I mean is
I'm not allowed to use any brushes my
fingers anything like that the most
thing that I'm worried about this whole
video is my eyebrows how the am I
meant to do my eyebrows with a Beauty
Blender I don't know but everyone
praised me because I'm once again gonna
need it so without any further ado let's
get straight into this video if you guys
are new to my channel don't get these
that subscribe buttons can probably
spoil my future videos and let's get
into it the big letters about today is a
big one like this and a little one like
this is from Real Techniques and this is
from goodie bundle brand so I know it's
cheating using a little money well but
 using the full big thing for my
eyeshadow and everything like that so I
got the one here
okay so my eyebrows were normally City
is I take my get brow and I'd use a
brush but I can't please someone tell me
how this is going to work
thank you so I'm gonna get some it up on
my finger and put that for my brow oh my
god
holy
this ain't go why did ain't God work
Marty is nothing gonna clean it up while
I just did breaking the rule you know
what I mean now that a second eyebrow
I'm just going to do the same oh my
 god
I was going to do my eyebrows just like
normal and just like and I'll make it a
part of the Challenger than I thought no
why would I do that
this is mentally fun and that will just
ruin it and make it a serious video and
none of my videos seriously when I'm
talking about something that's very
important okay now that my brows are
looking bushy is let's move on to
concealing these brows so I'm just going
to take a little bit of concealer on
this little sponge but I bought three of
these I can use thank you and I'm just
going to conceal am i though is that
even if it's going to work right I'll
just which may conceal it to this
heart-shaped a to look like sticker
coverage and that's what we need right
now
how about this bro okay not too bad
the point on this sponge really does
help get in there yes okay what I'm
going to do now is I'm just going to
take the rest of that concealer and I'm
going to put this all over my eyelids
today excuses my eye base by the way if
you guys have any requests for full face
videos leaving down below make an
interesting making fun make and
completely different name something has
never been done before
kizomba labatto's full face challenges
they're so fun to do guys like so just
fun there's fun videos okay now that my
eye base is looking good I'm just going
to set that with a little bit of
translucent powder which is over there
so I'm with that I'm going to take a
little bit of my art you may know called
powder just to set my eyes lip straight
over the top with translucent powder you
know what guys actually have high hopes
for this video I feel like it's going to
work out for me which would be awesome
and was this like sled full fake
challenge like nikkietutorials labelled
her challenges ha moving on for
eyeshadow today I'm going to be using
being Kylie Jenner burgundy palace oh
love this palette so much okay now that
I've got you guys nice and zoomed in by
the way say whole bird to Mars planet
Mars up here thank you
I don't know why I've been breaking out
a lot lately it just soared me and I
don't normally break out this much but
yeah okay so moving on I'm going to take
this brown shake here just on my booty
blender I'm just going to put that all
across my lid now I'm going to turn the
beauty blender around with no product on
it and blend out those edges okay it's
kind of working
it's kind of sticking to the concealer
because it's being put on so harshly
it's not blending out very well but I
mean it's kind of working and just the
same on this I here
okay now I'm going to take this like
ready color up here and I'm just going
to put that I'm going to live and blend
up as well don't always have transition
bar there either guys so I'm just going
to smooth
thou shalt do winged eyeliner today I
don't think so how does that
even work
okay this eyes looking a bit messy but
this one is a bit more turned down but
that's okay now a little bit of
something-something
I'm just going to take this a gold share
here and plot this on my lid because I
just really do much with a fryer yeah
okay now moving on to my skin I'm just
gonna take the Mac prep and prime
natural radiance primer and I'm just
going to play this all over my face
doesn't really blend up which is not
very hard at all and what I never
applied for my mother Beauty weather a
lot of quiet I always use my hair but
this actually feels pretty good just
doing it it's nice up tada God my eyes
are so boring don't know but you're very
limited to what you can do when it's
something like this moving on to sounds
Diddley Dacian I'm gonna take the mark
Jake is remarkable in the shade bits
glides and the Giorgio Armani limited
silk in the shade backwards but mix
these two babies together comes brand
new favorite combo then I'm going to
take my Beauty Blender and just go
straight in now this has to be one of
the easiest part of this whole challenge
which is who the is a Beauty
Blender for the foundation on unless you
prefer a brush I promise where there's
someone in the house right now that's
not it's really weird
who's that oh my god stop just taking
that foundation over windows as well now
bringing this up onto my forehead once
all my foundation is done I'm just going
to take my heart-shaped tape again and
I'm taking the product on the back of my
hand I'm not applying it to stick to my
eyes
that's cheating so take that on my
Beauty Blender and straight number there
I kind of just created this line on the
outside of my life to give a bit of luck
sharpness to the look I feel like this
is going to be the easiest part like
what you'd normally use a Beauty Blender
for when we get to contouring
 bronzer that is where it's all
going to go downhill and I can feel it
in my waters kind of am I going to
put eyelashes on I'm cheating with that
part for our next exam stray dog doesn't
suck would you use a beauty blender to
put on lashes anyway please answer me
that if I get accused of cheating
supporting my lashes on with my fingers
I'm just also going to take the leftover
that concealer on my forehead like the
middle part of my forehead and nose my
chin just like Cupid's bow just taking
some more of the occupied no kala pattar
I'm just going to get my Beauty Blender
into that and just go straight over that
concealer this is exactly what I
normally do we do so I don't see how
this could go wrong whatsoever this is
too easy to fit the rest of my face in
place I'm just going to take the art for
our chances and pout out in the shade
light just going to dust up all over my
big head with dips sponge evenly
discuss the product around the place and
you should be fine
wait how am I going to sweep off my bag
that's something I didn't think of Sam
okay so all my entire face is set for
the gods
powdered ready to contour
everybody wish me luck because this is
the part where it's all going to go
downhill
I thought the eyeshadow was not that
great when do I start contouring then
thank you
so College one today I'm just going to
be taking my pull-up bronzer by it
benefit and I'm just going to scrape it
make you tea blend up in the top set up
at the back like this and then I'm just
going to go
it's working thank you and this
won't rub a little bit like that perhaps
you look coming sweet okay we have this
working which is great because the more
steps we do where everything works to
better this is going to work out and
book any ends
blending this around my entire face to
make it look snatch and contour it now
to contour my nose I'm just going to
take a tiny bit of color and just run it
down the side certainly the right shape
to get up in there to make a nice line
like that okay now I'm told you a little
bit under my bottom lip to give you
appearance of a big elliptic mass of
both small
creating a draw I'm simply easy and on
all you want to do to find the chin here
could that pull bit in and turn your
head to the side find your jawline and
down thank you run up my face a little
bit I'm just going to take the eyebrow
map versatile bronzer and just a little
bit of that I'm just going to write
handedly subscriber bar for concho ah
I'm going to bring this up across my
forehead a bit to help blend out that
contour I'm not even kidding just looks
like one of the best contours I've done
much is that somebody ordinary it looks
alright in person but I might be coming
up maybe on camera who knows Chris today
is going over the contour and bronzer
edges just to make sure there's no harsh
lines okay not looking too bad to be
honest I'm actually pretty happy with
how this looks so far let's do some
blush the blush I'm using today is Mel
bar by Mac this is the blush that goes
with literally any single look that you
do I'm just going to take a little bit
of that on the tip of my Beauty Blender
and start packing that just a little bit
of color can you guys see that I'm
actually so happy with how this looks I
do you think I'm doing well leave a
comment down below but it can still all
go real fast up from this point onward
thank you just making sure that everyone
knows back so the underneath of my eyes
I'm just going to go it back to the
polygenic burgundy palette and I'm just
going to take it the real tip of my
Beauty Blender and I'm just going to go
into like the brown color and let that
bird sort of color and I'm going to
stick it right underneath my lash line
not bad not bad or bad okay I think my
eyeshadow is done but I do need to blend
out those harsh edges you have no idea
the temptation is real I just want to
pick up a a blending brush and
just blend this all out but then stones
can take this sponge and just double
round the edges okay I don't know why
this icy is slow bloodshot so if you're
annoyed by that I'm really sorry
can't help it so now I'm done with my
undereyes a identical wipe off that they
concur so much leaders going to swipe
that away and look precedent as I go
let's do mascara now mascara obviously I
was actually thinking about getting this
 little thing getting my mascara
wand pressing onto the scene and if
we're gonna add that I thought that's
just a bit too far like your ladder duty
so I'm just going to apply some mascara
to the Too Faced better than sex and
I'll be right back
let's do some highlights need a little
bit of six clusters growl I'm working on
my going to stick to I'm just going
to spray a little bit of fix plus a
little bit I want to do this right okay
musical to highlighter this is B as your
automatics start powder in Bridget I
have not use different so long I
actually really like this hollow so
green let's see if it looks pretty when
I put it on with a deal and I'm
here so I'm just going to swipe swipe
around in there and oh yeah let me think
pack it on pack it on take it across my
nose
I'll maybe I put a little bit
too much on my nose I'm
just going to blend over that my whole
nose is highlighted what am
I going to do oh my god what am I going
to do I'm just going to go over like my
nose a bit with some translucent powder
because I've literally just cooked my
shoulders with phyllo dough how we
looking guys all good wait I'm just
going to also stick some lashes on and
then we'll finish the whole look when
I'm back okay now that my lashes were on
I'm actually living to this look so I
must revise the brows a bit the
eyeshadow is a bit up there but
other than that like my skin looks so
good just having my costume and
everything else is stunning for my lips
I'm just going to take Mac velvet eggs
the matte liquid matte liquid lipstick
I'm so used to using liquid lipsticks
about that all I say this is a matte
finish let's think I'm just gonna take
my little beauty blender or my little
sponge and get a shit-ton of that lip
color and just about this up I'm
thinking that line my lips before it I'm
like that's actually a joke
now for my cutest blows I'm
a little bit more on the center there we
got her sorry
