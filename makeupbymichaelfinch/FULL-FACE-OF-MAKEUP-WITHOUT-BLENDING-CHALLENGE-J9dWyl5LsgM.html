today I have rather a different video
today I'm going to be doing it the full
face without blending now to be honest I
don't really know how quite going to
work I've only watched one of these
videos I'm not really sure who started
this trend but the one that I saw first
was by a girl called oMG it's Maya or
something so I'll leave it the link down
below if you guys are interested without
any further ado let's get straight into
this don't know how it's going to go so
which mean fucking life because I'm just
like have a fucking moment even do my
eyebrows by first I'm going to be going
with my Anastasia dip brow pomade now
this challenge is no way this is so dark
I think this is I picked up the wrong
one it'll have to do sorry to do my
brows normally I just draw a line
underneath here and then I just draw a
line on top and then what I do is I just
get some more of the pomade normally and
I put it through and blend it like
rudder backwards and forth well I don't
know that do that because this is
without blending so I guess what I can
do is just put lines through it and I've
done we blend all the edges together and
everything but can't fucking do that now
can I now that my eyebrows are somewhat
done I guess I'm going to be moving into
the eye base and to do that I'm going to
be using the nyx concealer and this is
like a yellow shade and i'm just going
to put this over my eyelid now what is
blending when it comes to this part like
what that's just obviously applying it
blending it it's like with a brush i
guess or with a sponge so for now we're
just going to apply this all over the
lid with that blending was oh my god i'm
so like I don't even know what to even
say now just to set that I'm going to
take my benefit hello flawless
foundation powder and I guess I'm just
gonna OH
hahahaha boy this is gonna be the most
fucked video I've ever done why did I
just choose to choose something so dark
to set my lids with I thought this was
going to be like lighter without
blending so I don't know what's blending
so I'm just gonna
at this on does that even count who
fucking knows this isn't even a conceal
well let's like a concealer but it's a
yellow concealer I don't even know why
I'm using under my brow but whatever
anything goes I guess by ok blending is
like swerving isn't it and like endless
amounts of padding that's what I won't
do
fuck I look weird oh my god why this is
actually fucked up already like this
tutorial is already fucked off his head
now I'm actually going to be doing my
eyes last today just because I can uhm
so moving into primer I'm just going to
be taking the Mac strobe cream and
normally when you put this on you do
some dots and then you blend it around
your face like you blend it into your
skin with your hands or a brush or
sponge how am I meant to do that with
this okay so after I drew this part now
what do I do to blend this shit out
black joy or do I just like is this
blending or if it is isn't it alright
I'm just going to do this what the fuck
ever then we already know this video is
a fail so it can't get much worse I hope
now taking my Milani perfecting
concealer foundation in the shade creamy
vanilla because I'm not Ted at the
moment scrubs it although last night
ready to can't tonight so excited I'm
just going to be squirting some of that
onto my hand just a little bit okay cool
what I normally do with my foundation is
I apply it with a paddle brush and then
blend it out so what I'm going to do is
just apply it with the brush and
obviously not blend it out hence this
challenge or you guys this is absolutely
stunning hmm oh I just realized what's
actually going to happen
I'm not going to blend this out and now
I've got quite large pores on my face
when you don't like blend it and press
it into those pores I know that sounds
cringe-worthy as fuck but it just hangs
over it you can see the pores
I'm not going to zoom you guys in at all
because that is rank boy this foundation
actually smells so good someone has to
comment the other day saying how good
does it smell it fucking smells awesome
I just noticed how good this actually
smells I kind of resemble a boiled egg
right now especially with my hair
I'm just going to move that back a
little bit I don't want to get
foundational over my $10 hat from ruby
shoes for those who are asking all
that's mixed in perfectly with that
strobe cream I don't think even
nikkietutorials could make this
challenge look good and if you actually
know what that's a lie you probably will
know I come okay so once your
foundations all on now what I like to do
is go straight into it I can seal up and
I'm just going to be using the Mac
Studio no the Mac Pro Longwear concealer
at NC 15 and just playing a little bit
of that on the back of my hand
I'm not up my hair a lot of my hair a
lot of my hand
Oh Haley one of those days where I kept
looking into the viewfinder so oh don't
know why because I look absolutely
stunning just taking that concealer I'm
just going to plop that under my eyes
Joey my face actually sting oh my God my
face fucking stings so much right now
like it's on fire and I just
highlighting the t-zone I'm coming at
you kid words words very important with
a look like this and I'm just going to
highlight my forehead and a little bit
above my brows also because that's why I
drew bring powder I'll add when I do it
and just around the corners of my mouth
just to conceal that and a little bit
around my nose as well well she is
looking absolutely stunning
now we need to set everything start to
bake run in my eyes I'm just gonna grab
my translucent powder so BRB just taking
my trusty hacia Manor color powder and a
little bit of that into the lid and I'm
just going to take this morphe g-33
brush I don't even know what this is for
but I'm just going to actually bake on
my eyes because you really want to set
that concealer bro-bro this actually
feels absolutely amazing I can't go out
to rock that can't wait to go out and
rock this afterwards
oh my face hurts like it just hurts
there's not enough powder in this world
to set this face right now okay I am
gonna miss all this around here I'm not
getting foundation on my hat because if
this fucking challenge of making my
whole face sting thank you thank you
bindi bindi
beam
now I'm just going to take that benefit
um foundation powder again and just set
the rest on my face this is so cringe I
hope you guys are at home cringing as
hard as I am right now it's not even
fucking setting what's the fucking point
of this but if there's wet foundation or
in here from my face
it's not even fucking sitting oh he's
serious boy if anything is blending at
that's cheating I'm actually not
blending that on purpose
oh I just want to scratch my whole
fucking face off okay moving on to
bronzer I'm just going to take the Ofra
americano bronze up is one of my
favourite brothers ever so I'm just
gonna be taking my a benefit bronzing
brush and I'm just gonna bronze up my
cheeks this is definitely a look I'm
just gonna bring that up around me oh my
god I was just blending that whole
entire time oh oh my boy actually feel
sick did I just ruin this challenge you
know I'm gonna do cuz I actually feel
like physically sick from doing that
I'm just going to take my foundation and
get an interest go through that because
that's fucking cheating I didn't even
see what I mean that's what I was scared
about before I filmed this I'm like you
know what I've always gonna end up
blending the whole thing like without
even noticing no no I'm just going to
take my benefit powder again and just
quickly set that so we can continue on
with the wrong thing cover that well
done oh yeah moving back to the bronzer
I'm just gonna swirl that in there and
just there we go
not too much boy that's actually not
that bad not gonna lie this will make
your forehead appear smaller if you come
to and bronze around the side but it
doesn't look that bad in the viewfinder
oh you should see it in person not gonna
lie though this is actually the amount
of foundation and concealer that I
normally put on but when I enjoy
tutorial what I actually blend it out so
this is actually why tutorial would look
like if I didn't blend anything yuck
little bit I know my bottom lip to give
the appearance of a bigger lid because
my lips are just so small and then don't
forget to bronze your jawline to prep it
for the contour which is going to be the
best part of this whole tutorial I can
already feel it in me waters okay that
is absolutely stunning now we are moving
on to some blush this is the rose gold
blush from it's all about makeup oh my
god I'm still like this sort like I
still love it I just haven't used it you
know how there's always new makeup
products coming out and you forget about
your face this is one of my whole phase
I'm just gonna take the brush here I was
going to dip into that and I'm just
going to pop that on it the apples of my
cheeks and not blend back but just move
it back up the buck oh that is actually
stunning and then I'm just gonna push
that back normally I'd say blends back
but that's against the rules
okay dark mmm sir apples and back thank
you
BAM maybe on to highlighter I'm gonna be
using my art fraud Beverly Hills cuz
this shit is the fucking bomb diggity
doctor motherfucker come i'ma take my
you know I'm not gonna take that fucking
brush because I don't want to get
foundation all over because I might
actually need that tonight thank you so
taking my Beverly Hills highlighter I'm
just gonna highlight the high points of
my face
ah fuck I'm good so I'm just oh my god I
just blended that without even noticing
Oh
see what I mean this challenge is
actually so much harder than you guys
think I was actually bled okay so I'm
just gonna I just fuck him cook stop
cheek highlight absolutely cooked it
right fucking blended that from as soon
as I put on the skin pretend that never
happened I'm not gonna grab of his
foundation cuz I don't have to fix the
bronzer the blush like fuck that that
wait
imagine if blending wasn't invented
though this would be everyone's face was
I blending that I don't know you fucking
over it seriously by now just above my
brows okay looking absolutely stunning
I actually mistakenly forgot to contour
which is a first because I've already
highlighted on I haven't contoured yet
so just going in with my makeup geek of
contour shade I'm just going
take some of this one and some of this
one just on this brush here and just
gently chisel out my face now what this
is gonna do is it's going to make your
face look slimmer and it is also going
to accentuate your highlighted areas
because it's going to push all the shift
up that you don't want by the way if you
guys have any other challenge video
ideas that you guys want me to do like
full faces this full face of that leave
it in the comments below and the one
that gets the most thumbs up I will do
it can't forget to contour with this
big-ass fucking nose because it stands
out like the fucking Himalayas so I'm
gonna just contour down the side a
little bit just contouring my jaw ever
so slightly cuz I want to look skinny

gonna pop that over that don't even take
off use that color it's actually nice
I'm just this little well thing is I
can't blend those out when this tree
together that the top of the eye shadow
is done now what we are gonna do also
sits a little bit underneath the eye
just to bring the whole look together so
