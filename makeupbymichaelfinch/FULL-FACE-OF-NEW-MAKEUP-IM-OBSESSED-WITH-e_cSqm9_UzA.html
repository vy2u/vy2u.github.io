channel so today I'm gonna be doing a
full face of makeup that I have been
absolutely loving and living for the
past month or so so basically the point
of this video is just to show you guys
like my like new favorite makeup
products or whether they're new or not
like products that I've been loving the
whole like monthly favorites thing just
really isn't kicking it for me and I
wanted to like do something more a
little bit more productive rather than
just sitting here talking about the
produ yeah so I've got quite a lot as
you guys know I've been a little bit ma
from YouTube lately just been going
through some struggles myself
hence what have got so many pimples at
the moment I've probably got at least 30
normally I have only two but I've got a
lot so I'm got a lot to cover up today
um that's just a fact of life dull
pimples Pip dad's pimp pimp squats so
without any further ado let's get
straight into this video and if you guys
enjoy it make sure you give it a massive
thumbs up and let's go I must apologize
because I don't know what's happening
with my hair at the moment I haven't
been to the hairdresser's in too long I
had just I just haven't been I just
haven't been bothered alright so getting
started with my brows I've been loving
using the precisely my brow pencil from
Benefit Cosmetics this is in the shade
number three and what I like to do with
this is literally just go straight up on
in my brows now you guys know that I use
Benefit select every single video you
know why because I'm literally obsessed
like I just can't live without my
benefit brow products they're just like
they've got such a good range so I just
kind of like to fill in it the natural
shape that I have going on and I always
like to extend the ends then what I like
to take is my full proof of brow powder
from benefit this is in the shade at
number three and I just like to get the
lightest shade of that and then
just kind of just push the product to a
road kind of keeping like older top out
of my bars clean and just kind of
running over everywhere that I've gone
just with that powder and last but not
least I just like to take take a little
bit of the Gimme brow and just brush
through my brows now oh my god my hand
needs to just sort itself out because
I'm not living for this situation the
way that in Brisbane today is so lit
it's actually like raining pissing down
it's cold it's windy I just went and got
a coffee from the cafe down the road and
tried to tried to run back because I was
kidding so wet this shirt is like dead
but I'm just so wearing it I'm covering
up all the little Blondie's so like I'm
sick from the weekend I went out two
nights in a row and I'm just not gonna
backing it up so I'm a little bit sick
snotty nose bloody face hair shut
up so the next product I've been loving
lately is the NARS radiant creamy
concealer this isn't a shade creme
brulee so I'm gonna put a little bit of
juice onto the back of my hand a little
bit when I say a little bit I mean a lot
like eight dips then I'm just gonna take
a flat synthetic brush probably too big
let's take this one here and I'm just
gonna go in and like conceal under my
brow like I normally do
this is pain just really like nice to
change up from me chart eight shape
lightly right and then I'm going to take
that same concealer all over my lids now
I've seen this new trick I think I've
seen like Nicky do it quite a lot and I
think makeup my jaw does it as well
it's just getting a flat brush and
instead of using like a Beauty Blender
or any other brush you just literally
like press oops the product in oh my god
it's my mom miss my mom's sorry much oh
she's at work I tried to FaceTime her
before god bless I think I'm doing this
right
I've also been seen like people not set
their base but I'm too scared to do that
maybe I'll try that out in a video but
oh that just terrifies me now I'm going
to take a little bit of my influence and
power off and just set that in okay
perfection now I'm moving in to
eyeshadow I have been absolutely living
breathing and gagging for this
is easy soft glam palette from Anastasia
Beverly Hills Anastasia
adding a lot 1 and then you want to bail
on how do you smell on I'm gonna be
taking the transition shade called
orange sorry now I don't know any of you
guys remember heartfully you do it would
be cool because honest arts who used to
sell a palette back in the buckler and
it was called the lavish palette and it
was like my guru it had the shade I
remember it had a Sienna in there and
had orange started in there and I had
like a few other things in there but
like oh it's just brings back memories
of using the lavish palette I used to
use the lavish palette every single time
I did my makeup because it was like one
of the first Anastacio products I own
and I was like holy like Ireland on
estancia Beverly Hills pot I like this
is so cool
i'ma start here as a brand that's very
close to my heart told because I'm
pretty sure the first ever eye shadow
palette that I bought actually no that's
a lie I didn't buy it
Anastacio back in the day they actually
sent me a package like a PR package
I remember they shoot at me like heaps
of brushes they sent me that brow Pro
palette this was back when I had my old
youtube channel like I literally had
like no followers or anything like that
and they fully sent me like so much
all right so I'm just taking orange soda
and I'm more so blending it through now
this palette is like it's sorry good
it's like the modern Renaissance is to
stop pretty much now I'm just gonna be
taking a little bit at the shade called
Sienna it's like a warm tone Brown I'm
just gonna gap that right on my out of
thee and I'm just gonna pull it up
through my crease now these are sorry
pigmented and buildable and there's not
that much fallout at all okay now that
looks a bit of a mess at the moment but
we're gonna blend it out just taking a
little bit of Sienna on this bigger
blending brush I'm just gonna
slightly not take it too high but I'm
just gonna blend it into burnt orange
orange soda I mean I'm just gonna take a
little bit I'm actually not gonna take
anything on this brush I'm just gonna
take the brush that I used my transition
for and kind of just blend over the now
the last I'm gonna take a little bit of
the shade called Noah and y'all know I
know I always forget how to say it never
one comes to me some take a little bit
of that and I'm just gonna slightly pack
a little bit of that I'm right out of V
and I'm just gonna bring the black op
slightly halfway through my crease and
then stop then I'm just gonna take a
little bit more of Sienna and just blend
out that black slightly okay so now that
that's all done I'm just gonna be taking
the shade called bronze which is this
beautiful gold shade and I'm just gonna
be taking it on a flat brush I'm just
gonna spritz my brush with a little bit
of makeup setting spray that is B Gerard
cosmetics sale title and I'm literally
just going to pack this on we're not
gonna be doing a cut crease or anything
like that today we're just gonna keep it
nice and simple
so a little bit of something-something
on the lid you felt your that it's not
chunky either which is also really good
and then I'm just gonna slightly blend
around those edges just so there's no
harsh lines or anything like that okay
nice and symptom you guys get my gist
okay I've just cleaned up underneath my
eyes and kind of just strung it out at
the side that's the Bible gonna go with
today really I'm to mascara you guys
know it's just the benefits bad go
bang I've been loving this sick this
month now for lashes I don't really have
a specific pair that I've been loving so
I'm just gonna go in with these ones
from morphe these are in this style
called chummy-chummy dick hey hey chubby
dick hey wow these are very shiny lashes
like I could see Shaunie wearing this
style I'm just gonna take a little bit
of the House of lashes
Cleo lash glue today not black and I'm
just gonna pop it on the back of the
lash band
straight against oh my god these are
beautiful Basson eyes oh oh god
Reggie I think I just found my new pair
of favorite lashes holy candle so
obsessed with these lashes holy
okay let's move on to the fifth
okay guys moving on to primer the one
that I've been using the most as of late
is the Sicily Paris primer I literally
love this but I'm not gonna use it in
today's video because it is a very
expensive product it's not very
beneficial for me to be using in a video
like this but I have been loving this
and if you are are after a very good
primer that makes your foundation go on
so nicely
and just like sits on your skin really
beautifully then this is definitely
amazing for that but instead I'm just
gonna be going in with the mecca Maxima
anti redness primer this actually dulls
your redness so much it's like green
sorry I'm just gonna be squirting some
of this out onto the back of my hand
it's like all my fingers
it's literally green it really does dull
the redness on your face which is really
good oh my god I'm sorry about it
shaving I've missed like this patch here
it's like a little goatee call me
Shannon no don't call me Shannon dick
hey when I used it the other day I think
I put way too much one of my face is
literally green but foundation like
that's does my face like not look as red
for methylation today I'm gonna be using
the dermablend professional I wore this
at my master class in Auckland I'm
pretty sure holy love live dye
braids are so good and I believe you can
get this in Priceline as well I bought
this when I was in America it's probably
a little bit too yellow for me
but we're gonna make it work and I'm
just gonna dot it or over I'm just gonna
do like half of my face so you guys can
see the coverage that it has oh Sh I
didn't wear my Beauty Blender okay
my Beauty Blender is nice and wet I'm
just gonna take a little bit off the
back of my hand on the sponge before I
go in and then I'm just going to go in
and blend it out
such a beautiful foundation stunning
right which I love I feel like the
technology with foundation lately is
full coverage but so lightweight I'm
just gonna use this foundation should
conceal the top of my brow okay you guys
vibe holy I'm just gonna do
the other half of my face and then I'll
be right back and we can do everything
else now for concealer for under my eyes
and Zhuhai let my teaser an area I've
been living breathing gagging
pissing for the Kylie cosmetics store
and concealer
well skin concealer in the shade Jones L
and I'm just going to be highlighting my
face with this and I'm also obviously
gonna take it right under my eyes going
straight in with my damp Beauty Blender
I'm just gonna blend all this out and
just blends out so nicely and once again
it's kind of really lightweight but to
be completely honest I don't see much
difference with this and the color pot
one they just dry it down differently i
watch rob christie Beauty raw beauty
Christy always get her name mixed up but
I watched her view on it and it was
really really good so um yeah they just
dry it down differently and they just
dry differently in my opinion are you
straight up or only and under the eyes
this guy's my boy chops are starting to
wear off of my forehead look I can move
it again should I get more should I just
give it a break let me know in the
comments below so now moving on to
translucent powder to set my face now
been loving these two set my whole
entire face this is the Patrick Starr
maca Patrick's powder
honestly it's so worth it if you
can get your hands on this get your
 hands on it it's got like a
peachy undertone to it
it um attaches it like adjust to your
skin tone
it's gonna bang some of that out into
the lid and then just go to town under
my eyes I'm just gonna be using the same
powder to set over the rest of my face
the reason I've been loving is to set my
faces because it makes it look so smooth
and products pack onto it really well
like you know how sometimes when you
bake under your eyes and highlighters
starting to stick because you've got so
much powder there no matter how much of
this powder you put on and this does not
have flash back like it's meant for
baking this does not have flash back as
if Patrick would come out with a powder
that's got flash back to it new way
okay guys to contract my face a little
bit today I'm gonna be taking the Kevin
ak1 sculpting powder this is in the
shade medium now I first found out about
this from nikkietutorials and she said
it's amazing and it is it's so
good especially to contour like your
nose and the shades perfect to me
because it's cool tone and then you go
over with a bit of bronze AR and then it
just like it works the brush I'm using
is my favorite brush the contras of
light this is the XO Beauty jumbo face
brush and I'm just going to be going in
on my cheekbones now as I said it's very
cold tone so well the shade medium is so
going very sparingly with it but it
gives you that like cool toned
natural-looking contour and then when
you go over with bronzer it more or less
just like makes it look more natural
neutral I don't know anyway don't forget
to hit that July that just looks like a
natural contour to me like it just looks
like a shadow right then when you go
over with bronzer everything changes huh
just going to do a little bit on my
forehead as well I just going very very
sparingly with this you take too much
that's when it looks like you're gonna
have a big load of on your cheek
gel not cute guys so I'm just slightly
contouring of my nose just with this
little Anastasio brush and it's just
like it just looks so natural and I'm
bringing this contour up into the front
the top start part of my brow contour
but it looks like a natural contour to
me like that doesn't look too much
doesn't look like muddy or anything to
bronze up my face the bronzer that I've
been loving
is the Too Faced chocolate God's Soleil
brands are oh and it smells so good and
if you accidentally get it in your mouth
it's a blessing I'm just gonna be taking
it on that this brush here I'm pretty
sure this one's from japonesque and I'm
just gonna oh that's beautiful oh
sorry knives now can you guys see how
that contour underneath has made my
cheek look so chisel but not like fake
even though my cheeks are fake I'm also
just gonna be bronzing up everything
else on my face under my jaw line and
all the way down my neck just so
everything matches up very importante
and then whatever's left on the brush
I'm just gonna grow down the sides now
before I forget to finish my under eyes
I'm just gonna take the same palette
again and I'm all I'm gonna do is I'm
just gonna take the orange soda color
just here and I was gonna put that right
underneath my lash line right under
there like that and that's it oh God
oh am i oh okay so that's literally
all I'm gonna be doing to my eyes I'm
just gonna add a little bit of butter
masks are the bad gal bag now for blush
I have been loving this bronzer from
Anastacio Beverly Hills now I bought
this thinking it was gonna be a good
bronzer color for me I was wrong at
tomorrow's like a pinky turn blush so
I've been loving to use it as a blush
sir I'm just gonna take my bronzer brush
that I used for my bronzer cuz my blush
and my bronzers all gonna come together
gonna take a little bit that and I'm
just going to brush it on forwards
definitely not the right bronzer color
for me but I am gonna get one that is
the right bronzer color for me now
moving on to highlighter I've been
living this is the amrezy X Ariana
starsia Beverly Hills X I'm raizy
highlight it just looks like a wet moist
yeah it's just it's stunning like it's
so beautiful and it the packaging is so
like sleek like it's just
oh sorry nice so I'm just gonna be going
in with this on my a 23 brush you don't
need much either and it's not like a
thick consistency it's very thin so it
look out texture on the skin or anything
like that like the art for highlighters
I love like I love my for
highlighters but they tend to show quite
a lot of texture however this gives the
same amount of pigment but doesn't bring
out all the text should you know what I
mean and it looks beautiful and the skin
like it just looks glowy
it doesn't look chunky or anything like
that so and I like to bring my
highlighter down onto like my cheek
brain here just so it kind of reflects
when I'm looking straight on do you guys
like that look or not I love it
it's gonna take a little bit on just a
smaller brush and just hit the tip of my
nose and also the bridge and I'm also
just gonna pop it on my inner corners as
well cuz why the not now for my lip
color ha you guys I've been loving these
these are these Smashbox liquid
lipsticks I've been loving the shade
called got a light and fair game now I
know use this in the video not too long
ago just the combination of them both is
stunning so I like to hook this one down
first okay so that's what I like to put
down first so I'll put just color down
and then I'll just go over the middle of
it with the shade called fair game and
then I like to always set with the green
marble setting spray now this is a very
strong setting spray I have spoken about
this in my last video it's very intense
but it does keep my makeup on while
clubbing being in the Maldives
you can sweat through it and it doesn't
come off I've spoken about it a lot only
once before but it's so good it's very
intense though so like bear with me
holy balls I don't think you guys
realize how strong this is but it works
so well ah okay so this brings us to the
end of today's video I hope you guys
enjoyed this I'm gonna be doing these
videos a lot more often because it's
like I get to try out full face of first
impressions like I don't know if you
guys saw if you have me on snapchat or
not but I'll say any other day like full
face of first impressions I'm sick of
doing them I don't enjoy doing them so I
feel like if I try the products out
first and then show you guys what I've
been loving that's kind of like the
first impressions but I've already tried
it so I can tell you guys my thoughts on
it straight away and how it wears and
all that sort of stuff anyway I hope you
guys really enjoyed this video if you
did make sure you give it a massive
thumbs up I love you guys so much and I
will see you all in my next video bye
