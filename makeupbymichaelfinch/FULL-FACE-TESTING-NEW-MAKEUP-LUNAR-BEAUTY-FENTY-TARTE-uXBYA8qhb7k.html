today I'm gonna be doing another trying
new makeup video I have actually got
quite a lot in front of me and I'm super
excited to try it all out I know I just
did one of these like literally a few a
few videos ago but I want to stay
up-to-date with everything now because
everything's just been piling up and I
just want to stay up-to-date with it and
not do it like but three months
after it comes out sorry yeah I'm quite
excited if you guys enjoyed this video
or if you want to see any reviews on
anything specific let me know down below
in the comment section and let's get
straight into it so the first thing I'm
gonna be trying out today this is the
Alaska drag palette by Luna beauty this
is many anyways brand I purchased this
myself off he's a website I think it was
around 96 dollars Australian including
shipping all up now I have actually
tried these shades I used them the other
night when I went out clubbing and they
were really really good sorry today I'm
gonna be doing up the colorful shades
instead jr. you know change it up and do
something a little bit different now
this palette did come with a little
brush but I'm not gonna use that because
I really like brushes like that sir I'm
just gonna get into everything else
now I've already hopped on the pelo ease
eyeshadow base all over my eyes and I
haven't said it with anything so it's
kind of like creased a little bit which
is no more I'm just gonna pop this out
before I go in with my
the first shade i'ma go in with ears
let's take cocci which is the pink shade
and I'm gonna I want to try and use all
these colors do you not I mean so I'm
gonna go in with this I mean I'm already
impressed with this pink so I'm gonna
start by popping this on my inner corner
just yeah and blending it up towards my
brow
I'm just gonna have a little bit more
pink now I'm gonna take the next shade
called pageant queen which is the per
book tap tap tap my brush or that looks
so pretty on the brush doesn't it
love that and I'm gonna start by popping
this just here now purple shadows from
what I've heard of really hard to make
meaning like they're hard to get
pigmented Diamond operate patching all
that sort of stuff sorry
I'm gonna give this a whirl and say how
guys really really impressed with this
throw faster glitch just need to take a
clean brush kind of blend up hip
so I'm just kind of bringing that
crossly I'm just going to take a little
bit more pink and just pop it in between
the two colors just to keep this look as
clean as possible with the colors being
separate I'm just gonna change my
brushes up as I go into a totally
different new color I'm gonna use the
shade called Kiki which is like the
Tiffany color and I'm just gonna plunk
that right and before I got in with the
blur I'm gonna use this to use as my
like transition these blend out so I'll
and start good already so we got back in
and when I got in with the shade called
fishy which is the Doppler shift off so
I pigmented and I'm gonna blend that out
with my brush that I used with the
turquoise you shade I've lost quite a
bit of kiki because of the blue shade so
I'm just gonna go over the edge it's
gonna take someone's cake face but just
a white shade and I was gonna pop a
little bit of that under my brow bone
okay that plane sounds huge and I needs
to shut the up I'm also going to
take a little bit of pageant queen which
is the purple shade and just pop that in
the outer V just to give this some
dimension on the outer corner you know
what I mean
that's so much better with the purple
there holy that looks so good I
need to blend that out a little bit
slightly tapping blend out that ball
that planted had sorry while I'm so
impressed you guys now what I'm gonna do
just because I'm feeling it
getting a little bit more glam I'm just
gonna take some of Shady which is the
black color from the palette just a
little tiny bit cuz this stuff is start
pigmented because I used it the other
day and I'm just gonna incorporate a
little bit of that into that out of the
area I'm just gonna take a little bit
more pink and just pop that on my inner
corner alright guys now I'm just gonna
put a little bit of the hot SEC tape
concealer onto my lid and just do like a
little bit of a race not really I
don't really know what's gonna happen
but I want to put the gala shade on my
eyelid because I think that would look
so cool
it's gonna take a little blending brush
and more service Pat over the edge of
that conceal now I'm gonna take the
yellow shade praying to God that the
pigmented it probably is I love that I'm
gonna pack this ball over my lid
sir I've just built up that quite a lot
I'm just gonna take a little bit of blue
and some purple I'm just gonna blend
that into the outer edge if I need to
put something across this line here just
to make it a little bit more like
dramatic alright guys I'm just gonna be
taking the heavy metal glitter liner by
Urban Decay in the shade grind it's this
pink color here and I'm just gonna pop
this on the edge now to align my lash
line today I'm gonna be trying this out
from Smashbox
it's then you always liquid eyeliner in
the shade and black I'm pretty sure this
was some sort of collaboration with um
Lilly Singh Lilly sign superwoman yeah
on uShip sorry it's a pen fault she's
gonna do super thin line if this
blades I'm not gonna be a happy chappy
all right so I've just aligned my lash
line I'm really happy with that
it didn't blade sorry impress that's a
boss bi should i pilot for me already a
pass I'm obsessed what the
this is better than their Sephora Pro
palette the one to forget what it's
 cold but holy look at this
indie now for mascara I'm gonna be
trying it this one out from Smashbox as
well this is their fanned out mascara
called super fan this is also in
collaboration with superwoman
okay that was nothing special but you
know did the job my favorite mascara of
all time is hands down the roller lash
room benefit and they're better than sex
by two days so good now these lashes I'm
gonna be using today I've used these the
other day I actually stole these off
Shani these are from the brand Holy
Grail I forget what style they're in but
super super good lashes Shani
Wednesday's all the time and they always
look fantastic on her oh compliment for
once that was fantastic
I'm just gonna finish doing this side
and then I'm gonna do this I off-camera
because it took me so much time I just
put a little bit of the House of lashes
clear lash glue on the back and about to
put this baby on ok this lashes on
loving that I love this is so like this
is inspired me to do much it would call
off alright I'm just gonna go and finish
this off and then I'll come back and
we'll get started on everything else now
getting started on the face I'm going to
be trying out I've got three different
options here Smashbox bought out these
new primer waters there's a social
coconut one there is a centering citrus
or we've got the serene greens now I
kind of like sin a serene green so I'm
agreeing with this give it a quick
little shaky wacky that smells like
cucumber ah love that I don't know if
primer waters even work to be honest I
still don't know if I'm is work to me
it's just like a marketing scheme but
who knows whenever they're really gonna
find out now moving on to found diddly
Dacian I don't actually have a new one
but I can try out so I'm just gonna be
going in with my who to beauty cream
foundation in the shade custard 220
neutral
I've just rediscovered this I watched
Nick stick a lipstick NIC video the
other day and she used this and I was
like holy I need to like pull it
out of my drawer and like play with it
because it looks so good so now I'm like
fully obsessed with it again so I'm just
gonna take some of that on the back of
my hand but what I am gonna do is I'm
gonna mix in some of this stuff here
this is from Make Up For Ever this is
their soft light liquid highlighter I
just want to add a little bit of this
for a glory this is also new so it's
gonna incorporate that into it to give
myself bit of a glow because this
foundation is a really matte foundation
so I'm adjusting
and then because the unit Beauty
foundation is so thick I like to take it
with my morphe g36 brush and I just like
to go straight it now I know this color
is a little bit dark for me but well
actually it's really not it smells
really good show you this foundation
like I love the smell of it it's not a
cake and it's kind of good like not
using a Beauty Blender for once because
I can't be bothered getting off and you
know wetting it riffing on to concealer
I've got this v1 here from Todd this is
their new craziest concealer now these
are sample sizes because Shana got to
pay our package for them and I stole
these shades out so they's not in like
the original packaging but the shade I'm
gonna use is the one called SL I think
it's gonna be fair light neutral so I
don't know how this is gonna go under
the eyes anyway I'm just gonna use it to
highlight just gonna search my Beauty
Blender and 6-plus because while I don't
wanna get off that much under that eye
we're gonna see how it feels really
heavy like it feels sticky under the eye
which I don't like already we're just
gonna see how blends in
hmm pretty good coverage it's very wet
I'm just gonna leave the concealer a dot
it's looking really Joey you don't know
how it's gonna set down onto my hot spot
we're just gonna set it with D hourglass
translucent setting powder this is their
mineral veil and solution setting powder
yeah perfect lava
so I'm gonna give this a well or
bruising I've just tipped a little bit
of this into the lid to make sure
there's no creatures under my eyes but
I'm just going to go straight in with a
powder mmm I feel like I'm really gonna
like this powder I'm also just gonna
bake my nose like I always do just let
the rest of my face I'm gonna trying out
this Urban Decay all nighter long-wear
mattifying
weightless waterproof setting powder I
think this is like a foundation how to
see your face yeah instantly sets
foundation perfect or this packaging is
pretty cool I love that perfect okay so
I'm gonna use this to separate somehow
found dilatation I set your foundation
lat hmm no well so quick powder under my
eyes are doing to finish my under-eye
mazuma guys bring you back in wanna do
something a little bit different under
my eye area today and it takes me Kiki
which is about turquoise to color and
I'm gonna bring it all up in my actual
lash line to get the appearance is like
a bigger eye I guess so I'm just
bringing Kiki down let me use this as my
like my lower transition that blends
into my cheekbone now I'm gonna take
some offici which is the blue shade
okay we got the Builder going on under
there then I'm gonna go in with pageant
queen which is the papal I'm just gonna
blend those two together huh and then
I'm gonna take a little bit of shady
which is the black and I'm just gonna
focus on the outer V
you know because my eyeshadows done I'm
just gonna dust away
this powder my eyes and now done what
I'm gonna do is I'm just going to take
this in a rim liner from Tarte and I'm
just gonna pop this on my waterline and
kind of down a little bit more okay I'll
just pop that in there to keep my eyes a
little bit more open looking he's gonna
talk on a little bit of bottom mascara
the same one that I used from the
Smashbox thing oh okay well that should
go over here now as far as contouring
and bronzing goes Smashbox just came out
with this new palette here this is the
the Cali contour shape of bronze &amp;amp; Glow
sorry I think I'm gonna take some of
this cool train shade here it's gonna
take it on this hourglass brush and I'm
just gonna go in really lightly oh my
god that looks like mud on my cheek okay
maybe I'm gonna go in with this warmer
shade over here and blend that out a
little bit okay so that's si that I use
mine quite muddy any cuz I don't think
it's the right color for me or it's just
a muddy shade but I'm gonna go in with
this other warm tone one she's gonna hit
my jaw line quite heavily cannot forget
this big jolly five head so I
really liked the second shade that I
used what the fresh egg went so muddy on
me
I feel like this looks pretty cool I'm
just gonna go ahead and slightly contour
my nose just a little tip if you ever
got entry harshly with your nose contour
just take some of your foundation powder
I'm just going over how they smell so
clean once I cross looked like like a
hospital but like a clean Hospital I'm
just gonna take this a brightening shade
here just from that palette I'm just
gonna run that along the bridge of my
nose and a tip and then I'm just gonna
press that up against the edges of my
nose okay besides not looking quite
muddy we're just gonna ignore that I
will know not to use that ever again now
for my blush
this palette here from Urban Decay this
is there a bucket or palette and it's
got blushes in here and it's also got oh

that fell out oh my god it's a little
mirror that comes out that's pretty cool
so it's got blushes and eyeshadows so
I'm gonna take this blush shade just
here it's quite muted which I like
because I don't wanna do anything too
intense because it will with my
eyes and I'm just gonna brush that on
for it
it's the shade called double take now
for my highlighter I've got three here
huh these are all from Fanta beauty I'm
not gonna be using all of them but I
just want to show you guys some of them
and how pretty they are there's this one
here this one is called seven-day
weekend and poolside
I'm not gonna be using it that very this
one also looks amazing this is gonna be
really good for festivals this one here
as well love that and the one I'm gonna
be using today is the one called sand
castle which is this side here that's
got like a mint green over here and just
one do you know what this is gonna be
like still gonna have my a twenty-three
brushes from Shaunie's but I'm going
there soon so I'm gonna sell them all
back I'm just gonna dip into this just
see how this goes on that shake
so like it's that what I will do is I'll
go in in a minute with um some spray to
try and intensify a little bit because I
know it will get more pigmented but for
now I'm just gonna have this on here so
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna be
taking this CR say London Julie spritz
spray dink this is the setting one I'm
not sure but you're just gonna shake it
up mmm
shake to activate it looks pretty cool
so I'm just gonna spritz a little bit of
this all over my face because I don't
want a repeat of the cover effects right
remember now what I'm gonna do is just
let that dry for a second and then I'm
gonna take some more of the Fenton
highlighter and try and build it up a
little bit more yeah that's better
moving on to lips I'm just gonna be
taking this Kat Von D lipliner this is
in the shade at D minor and you guys
know I don't really like to like my lips
often but I'm going to today just a
little bit see what happens now it's
gonna take this lipstick from a
two-faced this is in the shade it's send
nudes this is from any little lipstick
collection okay I definitely need to
blend but you at least get off because
I'm looking quite dead at the moment
okay this lipstick is way too light for
this look I'm just gonna grow Robert the
two-faced skinny dippin lipstick much
that's wrong okay now just reset
everything in place I'm just gonna take
some more of that a Jewish setting
missed from see I'll take London anyway

today's video I really hope you enjoyed
