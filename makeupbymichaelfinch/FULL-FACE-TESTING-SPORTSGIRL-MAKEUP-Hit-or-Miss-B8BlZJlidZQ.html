channel so today I thought I would do a
full face using only sports girl makeup
because it has been super highly
requested so highly requested so I
thought I'd just do it basically I
wouldn't place an order I think it was
around two hundred dollars of product
and then that exact day Sports go PR
contacted me and was like hey we'll send
you some extra stuff and I was like cool
so I've got so much makeup right here in
front of me
sorry botch so without any further ado
let's get straight into the video
I'm just drinking one of my smoothies
that I always like to make this I
featured this in a vlog like a week ago
two weeks ago um so you can go check
that out because I show y'all how to
make it okay so the first product I'm
going in with is the wonder brown
eyebrow palette this is what it looks
like
alright and I also have a ton of
Sportsgirl brushes as well so I'm gonna
be using them sorry everything is
strictly sports go
the or anything they don't do is
concealer sorry just gonna have to use
something else for that and I also have
this pack of face brushes here's wild I
will be using alright so I'm going to go
straight in with this eyebrow jaw and
I'm gonna take this lightest shade yeah
and just start filling in the brows
alright just continuing on with and so
far it's a really really good pigmented
it's packing on properly
now I'm just gonna taking the darkest
shade in that well I'm actually gonna
take this clear gel here cuz I feel like
this is gonna let me extend the tail of
the brow which I should have done before
anyway I'm just gonna continue on I'm
gonna clean that out with concealer
after because it's definitely needed
here and I'm just gonna do exactly the
same on this brow okay now that my brows
looking a righteous mess I'm just gonna
go and find a concealer that is cheap as
I can find to kind of going with this
makeup look okay so this concealer that
I'm gonna use is the Maybelline master
conceal just the only thing that I'm not
using that is not Sportsgirl related
only because they don't do one you know
now I'm gonna take this little smoky
shader brush and dip in true they can
see along and I'm just gonna clean up
underneath my brow now that under my
eyebrows are conceals oh gosh there's so
much in here I just don't know what to
use I'm just going to take that
concealer and just pop it all over my
lid area this is going to act as a base
for our shadows I'm just gonna take my
Beauty Blender and blend all this
concealer into my lid now to set my lids
in place I'm just gonna be taking these
Scotland Glory palette and I'm just
gonna take the beige highlight shade cuz
it's like closest to my skin tone and
I'm just going to see so I'm brushes
that I use might not be Sportsgirl some
brushes that I need to use that they
don't have I'm not gonna try and use
something it's not for the right part of
the face okay so now I'm moving on to
the shadows which is the eyes I'm gonna
take we've got a ton of eyeshadow
palettes here like I don't even know
where to dad sports go alright
so we have quite a few I should have
palettes we have this one this is the
burgundy palette which looks almost
identical to the burgundy palette from
Kylie cosmetics really want to know how
these work I think I'm gonna start off
by using this Swan um and in this one we
have this looks like the I think it was
called a royal page palette from
looks to my but I think I'm gonna use
this color and cooperate this somehow
so the first shade I'm gonna take is
this one here called damn Gina it's
gonna be used as my transition
stop complaining that's your fault for
not pissing on the beach did you well
alright so I'm just going to keep
blending this shade up all right look
I'm filming I can't deal with that noise
all right so the next shade I'm gonna
take is I think I'm gonna take some of
this shade here called squad squad
alright and I'm using a sports go brush
to pack this on and I'm gonna bring this
all the way to my inner corner and like
down into that little sucker - okay and
then I'm gonna be taking at this a
blending brush and kind of black shut up
wow I'm just gonna keep blending this
shutter ah Wow I shadow is good look at
sports go yeah okay and I'm doing
exactly the same on this I'm actually
really surprised at how good these
shadows are packing on in like blending
and it's gonna take a little bit more of
that transition color and just kind of
blend over the edge of that orange shade
so now I'm just gonna be dipping into
this sweet on the inside coconut
centered eyeshadow powder the one that
reminds me of the royal peach from Kylie
and I'm just going to go in with these
two Brown shades down here more
specifically this one and I'm just gonna
pack that onto the out of the just to
bring in some depth now just blending
that out as I go and then from this
palette called the greatest of all time
I should have brought up Wow everything
just fell out fantastic I'm just gonna
take the black shade from this corner
here and I'm just gonna pop that onto
the
mm-hmm one pigment y-you are
I'm just gonna halfway drag this black
across actually I'm gonna bring it all
the way to my inner corner it's not
gonna be very pigmented just because it
is like quite a chalky eyeshadow I guess
it feels then I'm just gonna go back in
and just blend out that black with a
little bit more Brown okay so now I'm
going to cut the crease I'm just with
that concealer that I used before just
gonna apply that all over and then look
okay that gives me a good line
and when I get to the outer edge I'm
just gonna kind of Pat that on now I'm
just gonna be taking this shade from
this palette called Atlantic and just a
flat shader brush and I'm gonna put this
on my lid where that pigment so go ahead
and I'm just gonna lightly blend into
the outer V I'm just gonna take a
smaller brush and just go right up
against that line
all right so I'm super impressed with
the pigmentation of this blue shadow
it's literally so nice alright so now
it's gonna take this black pencil liner
that came with one of the eyeshadow
palettes and I'm just going to push this
into my lash line and then I'm going to
take a little bit of that black shadow
from that palette and just go over it
this is just gonna set it and make it a
little bit more pigmented for mascara
I'm just gonna use this one called game
changer it's not bad it's quite light
now for lashes I have these four
different pairs here and I think I'm
just gonna use the ones on the bottom
here they look the fluffiest unlike the
most dramatic okay so we got there this
lash is finally on and it actually looks
pretty nice like it's natural but I feel
like it's really good for this law
because it doesn't cover up too much of
the cut crease that I've done okay so
now that my eyes are all done well the
tops of them at least I'm just gonna
move on to the face now the primer that
I'm gonna be trying is the time to prime
illuminating face primer a little bit on
this jolly forehead so this is a stick
form Foundation and actually this might
be just alright just a little bit too
dark so I'm just gonna apply all over my
face luckiest okay then I'm gonna take
this buffer brush yeah this is from a
sports girl thing I write and I'm just
going to blend this out coverage is
really nice it does feel like super
thick like I do have a lot of foundation
on that's because I do she's gonna keep
blending this in and I'm just gonna drag
it down my neck so everything matches up
alright so I just concealed the tops of
my brows with the foundation and now I'm
just going to keep buffing all this
directly into
my hairline to turn at orange and yellow
okay so overall the coverage is actually
super super good it just feels very
sticky and like I've got a lot of makeup
on like it feels heavy
now as I said earlier they don't have a
concealer so I'm just gonna use the
Maybelline master conceal I'm just gonna
use just to highlight the center of my
face and also my under eyes but we'll
get to them in a second
all right I'm just gonna go straight up
bony and underneath my eyes I wish I had
a concealer but make this tutorial like
so much more entertaining okay now I'm
just going to take the Beauty Blender
and start to blend all this product out
okay so now taking the perfectly peachy
of brightening setting powder I'm gonna
be using this to bake my face set the
rest of my face and underneath my eyes I
heard the clutch I got alright hyper
doesn't turn dark I'm just gonna get my
Beauty Blender into this and then just
straight underneath oh it smells like
peaches it smells so nice I'm just gonna
bake the under eye area and I'm also
just gonna run it over my entire nice
because I always bake that now I'm just
gonna take more of that translucent
powder and just set the rest of my
foundation I feel like it's adding a
little bit of coverage too which is good
that powder is starting in nicely to my
under eyes as well okay that's looking
at pretty good so now that that's all
set I'm going to move into finishing off
my under eyes I'm just gonna take some
of that damn Gina shade that I used as
my transition on top and then I'm going
to take a little bit of squad the orange
shade and just pop that under there too
then a little bit of the shade called
intense and I'm just gonna pop that
right in that outer corner then I'm just
going to take a clean blending brush
blend that together so it's nice and
seamless you guys these shadows are
actually so good like they're not like
incredible but they're not bad for the
price I'm just gonna dust off that
under-eye baked that I've had cooking
that bad it looks a little bit dry so
now I'm just going to be taking these
sculpting glow powder contour and
illuminate palette just here and I'm
just going to take this in middle shade
just a little bit cuz I don't know how
this is going to perform and I'm gonna
begin to contour and this is the
Sportsgirl brush wow that's really good
this is blending out really nicely and
it's a really good color for me that's
actually pretty good
okay we can work with this part forget
to hit that jawline and I'm just gonna
contour my forehead a little bit just
around the sides to kind of make it the
appearance of a smaller forehead don't
know if that's possible with my five
head but we're just gonna roll with it
I'm just gonna go in with just a smaller
brush and I'm just gonna slightly
contour my nose a little bit so I just
used that shade that I used to contour
my whole face with my nose and actually
contoured my nose super well it looks
really stanched now just for a little
bit of bronzer I'm just gonna take this
other shade here at the golden warm
contour and I'm gonna use this as a bit
of a bronzer today I'm just gonna pop
this oh yeah that's perfect for a buns
up I'm just gonna also hit my bottom lip
like underneath that a little bit more
around the forehead and I'm just gonna
run it over the sides of my nose just to
bring a little bit of warmth and I feel
like it fills in all the little blank
spots all right so now I'm just going to
take this blush from this eye palette
here and I'm just gonna take a little
bit I'm just gonna add a little bit more
mascara to my bottom lashes
okay so now for highlighting I've got
two different options of palettes here
this one and use this shade just here
just looks perfect for me all right so
I'm just gonna go in with this shade
just here and I'm going to start this up
yeah that's super nice just blending
that into my cake that's really nice
I'm so impressed sure I'm just gonna
keep blending that into my cheekbone
that looks really really nice
and now I'm just gonna take it on the
tip of my nose and a little bit on the
bridge cannot forget the Cupid's bow
it's like a really nice subtle highlight
but you can build it up now I'm just
going to take a smaller brush I'm just
gonna use this one and we're gonna take
this shade up here on my inner corners
just to brighten that area and I'm also
just gonna pop it underneath my brow
bone so now I'm just gonna be taking the
liberal matte lip cream in the shade Kim
and I'm just going to pop this o on my
lips
and now to set everything in place I was
gonna be taking the old day spray what
rosewater infuse makeup setting spray
and I'm just gonna spritz me things I'm
actually just gonna pop on a little bit
of this lip gloss because I feel like
this lip shade is to lack to me this
just came in one of the eyeshadow
palettes I think it's a lip gloss okay
that generally dream much but anyway
sorry this is the closeup of the makeup
just so you guys can fully suss out what
it looks like up close
I'm really impressed with the shadows
and everything like that's a highlighter
really impress with a foundation
considering it's only 15 dollars but
they do need more shades of that ASAP
the lashes mmm they are kind of annoying
to put on probably the eyeshadows I'm
most impressed with to be honest okay
guys so this brings us to the end of
today's video I hope you guys really
enjoyed this video because I actually
had a lot of fun doing it I was so shook
the whole time because the products
actually are so good and I haven't
really heard much about sports girl
makeup before this is the final result
I'm happy so if you guys enjoyed this
video make sure you give it a massive
thumbs up I love you guys so much
and I will see you all in my next video
