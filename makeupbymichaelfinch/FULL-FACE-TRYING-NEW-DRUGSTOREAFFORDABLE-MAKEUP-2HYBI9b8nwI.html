channel so today I'm gonna be doing a
full face of first impressions of a
drugstore makeup now if you follow me on
my snapchat and stuff like that you
probably have seen that I said that I
don't enjoy doing these I think I was
just going through a phase of being
uninspired and bored here we are today I
have a lot of new makeup I've got stuff
from astralis bu is wet and wild NYC
morphe designer brands makeup revolution
covergirl so much stuff model CO so I'm
gonna be putting it all to the test this
is my first impressions of absolutely
everything I've also got these
concealers that I've been wanting to try
out for so long the makeup revolution
ones these are meant to be like the tide
shape tape maybe there are maybe they're
not hot eyes I guess we're gonna find
out I'm so yeah without any further ado
let's get straight into it
so before I get started I'm just gonna
take some of the Australis lip plumper
and I'm just gonna pop this on and see
if this works okay I feel like I don't
need this but I'm gonna use it anyways
this feels good smells good let's see if
it does the magic and it's meant to now
of course we're gonna be starting off
with my eyes today so I'm gonna go in
with the makeup revolution concealer if
I can get the packaging off so
this one is in the shade c5 well it
looks like the top shaped a dough fit a
fixture on both of tundle and like I've
been getting a lot of comments on my
videos lately being like same makeup
different video on board do something
different couldn't agree more
I'm sorry I have an eyeshadow palette or
a few eyeshadow palettes I want to do
something completely different today I'm
staying away from the warm Browns and
I'm staying away from black eyeliner
just I'm gonna change it all up and I
hope you guys like it all right so just
concealed under my brow and I don't
really know if I can give you guys the
first impressions of this without doing
it on my under eyes so I'm gonna talk
more about it when I go to my under eyes
um by the way I got into a domestic with
my friend the other day and he either he
like scratch my Isle I scratched my eye
what does play-fighting it was just a
joke nothing serious
but I'm yeah that's why I've got all
this lankier this lip plumper
is starting to sting my lips kind of
like the toothpaste one does that means
it's working now just taking some more
of that concealer and just buffing it
over my lid area what I can say now is
that this concealer is actually pretty a
litte coverage pretty good coverage hmm
now I'm just gonna dust over a little
bit of translucent powder just to set my
crazy I've seen a lot of people not set
their conceal are on their lids lately
I'm gonna try that in a pan in a video
and see how it guards cuz I'm curious as
well gel
okay moving on to eyeshadow I'm gonna be
taking the makeup revolution London
sothey X I think this is a collaboration
with soft as nails I'm gonna give this a
whirl it looks so beautiful so the first
shade I'm a going in with is this pink
color
my gosh okay I'm gonna just take a less
dense a brush for this pot okay and I'm
gonna begin to buff this floor in my
crazy this shade is blending out sorry
beautifully and packing on over really
nicely so far okay come on makeup
revolution Hey
okay now I'm gonna take the orange shade
I'm gonna take that and I'm gonna pop
that through the crease along with the
pink the pigments are good once again
bringing it all the way into my you know
corner where guys these blend out like
Dada
it's a so to add more color I'm
just gonna be taking this other makeup
palette from makeup revolution this is
the iconic that vitality palette and I'm
just gonna be taking just like darker
sort of pink shade okay that's really
too much damn it I'm so I really want to
use purple but I don't know what else to
use so I'm just gonna go in with the BH
Cosmetics zodiac palette and I'm gonna
be taking the three purple shades with
some of them from down the bottom and
I'm gonna be taking that purple and
we're so bringing it through my crease
as well I'm also just gonna take a
little bit of that darker purple and pop
that into there as well all the way into
my inner corner now it's gonna go back
in with a little bit more of the pink
shade in the orange shade from the south
does nails makeup revolution palette and
I'm just gonna kind of blend over the
edges of the purple
now I'm just gonna put more of that
darker purple on my inner corner this is
just from the BH Cosmetics palette now
I'm just gonna be taking some of the
makeup revolution concealer and I'm just
gonna pop that on the center of my lid
down the bottom then I'm a look hot okay
yeah I've got me line I'm just going to
fill this in
so once I kind of got my middle sort of
part of cut crease going I don't even
know what the this is called I'm
just gonna go with the flow sis and then
gonna take the purpley shade from the
make our revolution color and I'm gonna
pack this onto the out of the outer
parts of the hallo cam it's gonna kind
of blend them into the middle and then
I'm gonna take the lattice sort of
shimmery champagne color or that is
pigmented yes and I'm just gonna drag
that down on to pretty much just the
center of my lid and then I'm just gonna
be blending the darker purple and this
champagne color together and I'm just
gonna add a little bit more purple just
because I feel like it and I'm just
gonna drag it into the champagne color I
desperately need to clean up this
fallout and I'm just gonna go up beside
cleaning up
so I told you guys I'm going to be
staying away from black gel liner so
instead I'm gonna be taking the new
morphe this is a gel liner in the shade
vitamin C se ASIS
all right so I'm simply taking my EXO
beauty eyeliner brush
I'm just going to quickly go off camera
finish off this liar and then we can
come back get started on everything else
you guys I'm struggling so much because
this liner dries out so quick it's going
like chunky and the first wing was fine
but like this one is like when you go
over it it like moves what's already
underneath so it's like very drying I
guess and hard to work with it's not
letting me do any so I'm pretty sure
this is as good as we're gonna get when
it comes to the wings okay moving on to
mascara I'm just gonna be taking the
covergirl turtle tease mascara now this
wand has got me up I don't know
what's happening with it but I'm just
gonna go in and give it a well oh my god
this is actually scaring me okay oh it's
pretty good
the wand is like allowing me to really
get up in there and it's giving them
like a natural look but like giving them
length and stuff no bad covergirl come
on sis I actually really like this one
so for my actual lashes today I'm just
gonna be popping on this pair from
designer brands these are the fur mink
and these are in the style feisty I
haven't really tried these lashes out
before but they look pretty cool
right so that is on it's very like
natural but I kind of like it for this
look because it's not covering up too
much of the color and the liner and
everything so I'm gonna go with this
okay so I'm pretty happy with how this
is looking at so far now that I've been
filming for literally two hours let's
move on to the face holy
when I'm trying out like new makeup and
different trying out different makeup
looks it just goes on and on and on and
on and on and like you know this has
literally taken me two hours condensing
this down in select five minutes it's a
hard task because I don't want to bore
you guys okay now we're gonna be moving
on to the face and I'm gonna be trying
out this primer from Australis is the
color click color correcting primer
Bryson illuminate and add radiance
sounds absolutely stunning to me Joe by
the way the lip plumper that I put on
before definitely worked it was like
stinging like in a good way that's what
it's meant to do so that definitely
worked that lip that's probably like a
good do for their arm to face let me
Jackson extreme except the Too Faced lip
injection extreme when you leave it on
or if you go over your lip line it makes
like a massive red line because it's so
intense however this doesn't but I feel
like it does the same amount of stuff so
a dupe for the Too Faced lip injection
extreme is the Australis lip plumper
it's pretty good if there's like this
little ant crawling all over your lips
really wanted foundation I'm gonna be
trying out this one from designer brands
this is their new matte velvet faint
foundation medium carb coverage this is
in the shade true beige I'm just going
to go and wet my Beauty Blender
because knowing my fat ass the god last
time they came out with one of these it
was the luminous one and I literally
love it so much and I'm just going to
begin on it's kind of got like a mousse
II sort of texture to it which I kind of
like hang that this works because I love
their old one I'm just gonna take my
Beauty Blender and dab onto a little bit
of the foundation that's on my hand and
I'm just gonna start blending this in
yeah we really like the way this is
blending into my skin okay I'm just
going to do my for
and that's again just going to town and
blending this all out okay now that my
foundations all done with moving to
concealer and to that I'm gonna try out
the concealer the makeup revolution one
that I use under my eyes but I think I'm
gonna go in with a lighter shade this is
the shade c1
it is actually really nice and it's
sorry I think I paid like six dollars
stray lien for it cuz I never make out
resolutions base like in London I think
right now I'm gonna go in underneath my
eyes with this and see how it performs
here we go
okay that has blended out perfectly it's
covered up my under eye bags that looks
good
I sure anymore Botox I can't raise my
forehead because it just creates lines
this okay so now to bake everything I'm
gonna be trying out the makeup
revolution bake and finish a luxury at
baking powder mm-hmm it's making a mess
as always - oh she's white
I'm scared it's gonna have flashback now
to set the rest of my foundation I'm
gonna be trying out this one from bi
asses the all day we're pressed powder
flawless coverage foundation powder this
is in the shade natural beige so I'm
just gonna dip in probably a little bit
job for me but it's giving it my face a
little bit more call it which is nice so
I'm just using patting motions rather
than swerving around because I don't
want to move any of the product that
I've already put down sitting up here
just making sure I go over everywhere
where I've put the liquid sorry it's
that's it okay so moving on to finishing
off the under eyes I'm just gonna pop
into the make our revolution palette
that I use at the beginning at the video
and I think I'm just gonna dip straight
into this bright orange color that I was
using through my craze very my like
crazy bindi need to wash my brushes
every single brush and picking up today
it's just dirty as and I'm not
living for it
alright so I'm gonna go in with this
iron shade and I'm gonna pop it right up
against my lash line and I'm just gonna
slightly blend that down then I'll take
a little bit of that shimmery purple
shade
and just pop it on the outer corner now
I'm just going to dust off the baking
powder that I've had sitting there at
360 degrees
that's brushed off quite nicely I'm just
gonna pop on a little bit of the
covergirl mascara moving on to a little
bit of contouring I'm gonna be trying at
the BH Cosmetics Studio Pro contour
palette and I'm going to be taking it
this shade up in the corner here just
going in sparingly so don't know how
pigmented this is so it's not all that
pigmented which I guess it's kind of
good because you can gradually build it
up that's actually really good sugar
it's gonna switch over to my fav
contouring brush the Sonics are jumbo
face brush does this gives me so much
more like bitchy contour like do you
know what I mean I feel like this
contour looks really natural to like
it's not does that look too much I feel
like it looks so nice for bronzer I'm
just gonna be trying out the Sun and
bronze bronzing powder from NYC I'm
gonna be taking it on this brush wow
that's actually really really nice wow
this bronzer is actually so gorge looks
done for a little bit of blush I'm just
gonna be taking this one from BH
Cosmetics this is B a floral blush
floral charm
floral candle then take a look at this
and just do that gift
for my highlighter today I'm gonna be
trying out the morphe britman rock baby
and paradise palette you there this
looks absolutely stunning I'm gonna go
in with this shade right here this is
called get laid
oh my god as a shade that's called vague
a vacation vacation shady bitch none of
these shade names of money that is I'm
so impressed and I'm like shook I'm
gonna add in some of the shed called a
vacation gay no vacation vacation
me gonna have something out over the top
oh my god that is stunning holy candle
oh my god you guys this is sari pretty
just gonna take a little bit put on the
tip minute a little bit on the bridge
and I'm also gonna add it to my inner
corners okay I really really like the
way this is sitting on the skin it's not
bringing out too much texture this looks
so nice now I always do a nude lip what
can I do instead you know what I was
gonna bite the bullet and do something
completely different to what I know me
to do because I bet y'all are ever seen
a nude lip I'm going to be
trying out this liquid lipstick from wet
and wild this is in the shade ride on my
copper right on my dick hey so this is
like a metallic sort of shade and I'm
just gonna do it just I've had
enough of a nude lip and I'm sure you
guys have to just gonna okay so this is
like not pigmented at all
mm-hmm I thought you need to build it up
I bought regular keys sir unfortunately
I don't have a new setting spray to try
out today so I'm just gonna leave it at
this I literally just sat there for like
five minutes trying to get coverage on
this lipstick and would not recommend
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and I hope I could change it off I
hope this video has inspired you to play
with color a little bit more um I've
been feeling really uninspired with
makeup on YouTube lately as well like
I'm just so sick to death of a
warm brown and a nerd
but like it's like my favorite thing to
do but I know I know they're also very
wearable so people like following
tutorials like that but if you guys have
any ideas it's like complete if you guys
have an idea that's never being done on
YouTube before that you think would be
fun for me to do let me know in the
comments below and I'll be sure to add
it to my list because I need to change
it out anyway I love you guys so much
and I will see you all in my next video
 see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
