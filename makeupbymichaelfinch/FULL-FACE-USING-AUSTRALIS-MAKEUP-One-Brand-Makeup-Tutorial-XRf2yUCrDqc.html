today I'm going to show you guys how to
get this look using only Australia's
products so let's get straight into it
first thing I'm taking is the oh hey
brow eyebrow shaping kit and I'm just
taking the gel side of the kit and just
kind of creating a new shape because I
always like to change my brow shape
every single day because I can do
whatever I want with them and it's so
good because I can always change them up
so I'm just taking that gel and putting
it through and creating that shape and
then I'm going to be taking the to
powder size I'm going to take some of
the light and from the dark so I'm going
to put the lightest at the front of my
brow and then the darkest at the back of
my brow to give that like little ombre
effect I don't know if you guys can tell
but it helps me a lot
then just rushing over my hairs I'm just
going to take the brows in and brush
that all through my hairs so they're
nice and brown and there's no blond
little hair sticking through now I'm
just going to be taking the lip base so
basically this is just a lip base that
goes on your lips and it's like a nice
soothing
I guess primer so it's ready for your
lipstick so it feels really good too now
moving on to concealer this is the
Australis by by blemished concealer and
I was so impressed with this concealer
because it's actually really good
coverage and it's such a nice color and
I was just overall really impressed with
it so I'm just creating a nice defined
brow with a little flat top brush I'm
pretty sure that brush I'm using there
is an Australia slum as well so I try to
incorporate some Australis brushes as
well so to like keep the whole full face
of Australis you know so I'm just taking
that concealer and putting it all over
both of my eyelids to prep for my eye
shadow now I'm just letting it out with
a real techniques new diamond sponge now
I am NOT a huge fan of this sponge when
I was blending my foundation out I start
like it left little lines all over my
face so it's quite hard to work with I
probably wouldn't grab it and pick it up
and use it again but we'll talk about
that later on in the video
now just setting my eyelids with the
Australia's fresh and flawless pressed
powder in the shade natural just so my
shadow goes on it nicely now I'm just
taking a little bit of sticky tape and
popping that on the sides to get that
nice sharp line now for my eye shadow
today
a Australis doesn't actually do any
powder eyeshadow so I had no choice but
to use the AC on to a kit so I'm just
taking those two shades a bit of the
cool tone and a bit of the warm tone and
I'm just going to be putting that
through my groove just to give a little
bit of definition in the eyes so I'm
just taking a small little blending
brush and continuously packing on color
and building it up so it is nice and
pinkman turd
I wish Australis came out with actual
powder eyeshadows that would be so good
and so helpful for a tutorial like this
now taking the Australis Green Day's
metallic eyeshadow I'm assuming putting
that all over my eyelid with a flat top
brush and this is a really nice eyes
shadow not going to light it's a really
good eye shadow but to blend it out it
is extremely hard especially when you
don't have a black or something - you
know blend that harsh line up with so I
tried my absolute best to blend it out
with the AC on tool kit shades and just
hope that it kind of worked out it still
wasn't blended to the best of my ability
but I tried okay I tried
microphone all the way down there bendy
so I'm yeah okay so after dropping my
microphone I'm just going to be taking
the sense no fear Australis liquid
eyeliner it's kind of like in this
little pinpoint form I guess so I'm just
kind of creating a rather big wing and
just joining that up with my inner
corner so it goes all the way across my
eyelid just so we have a nice wing then
I just clean up that eye shadow a little
bit because but I wanted to transfer a
little bit moving on to mascara this is
just the Australis mascara it didn't
give me much volume or length but that's
okay it still worked it still did a good
job and I just did pop some lashes on
I'm not sure what they were but I'll
leave them in the description
moving on to the face this is that see
ya see ya later pause primer this is
extremely mattifying and it does mattify
your skin perfectly and then i'm going
to be taking the ultra glory foundation
with the liquid strobe
like illuminizer is it illuminizer I
don't know but I'm mixing those two
together and just applying that to my
skin and look at the coverage that this
foundation has it's actually really good
I think it's going to be one of my new
drugstore
favorite foundations because the
coverage is amazing like look at that I
didn't even have to like lay that on and
the coverage is really good so I'm just
applying that all over my skin with that
Real Techniques sponge and I'm
concealing the tops of my brows using
that same foundation not the concealer
I'm using the foundation just to carve
them out so it's ready to go to do my
big-ass jolly forehead so I'm just
covering my whole forehead up with the
same foundation obviously it's pretty
straightforward from here on out guys
and just making sure everything is
blended going back in when the going
back in with that bye-bye blemish
concealer I'm just putting on my chin
Cupid's bow my nose and my forehead this
isn't going to give me a little bit more
coverage
it didn't really highlight because
basically the same color as the
foundation that I use but this concealer
is actually really good to use under the
eyes it did not crease it did not you
know come off when I put powder on it it
was actually really good so I'm really
impressed with this concealer so I'm
just blending that out and making sure
it is all blended and ready to go so I
can make the absolute out of my
under eyes so this stuff does not crease
but it increased anyway which was
awesome so I'm just taking the Australis
ready-set-go
finishing powder in true translucent and
just packing a generous amount of that
underneath my eyes now I do not know if
this has flash back because I stupidly
enough did not take a photo with flash
on so I'm really sorry I don't think it
has flash back but at mine I think it
might have a little bit but not too much
you can always knock it back you know
what I mean with another powder then
just sending the rest of my foundation
with the Australia's freshman flawless
in the shade natural that is one of my
favorite drugstore powders ever I'm
literally obsessed with it and I could
not live without it so when I use all
the time to set my foundation okay
moving onto your underneath the eyes I'm
just going back in with a little bit
more of those brown colors from the AC
on tool kit just to give a little bit of
definition under the eye you know and
then straight into the waterline I'm
taking this Australis gel pencil I'm not
sure what shade this is in but I'll
leave it down below are you stirring
this when I first started makeup and I
actually love the formula it stays on
and it doesn't move really easy to apply
and super creamy so it's good and then
I'm just putting a little bit of mascara
on my bottom lashes and a little
it just over the top of the lashes just
to get any excess powder out now it's a
contour now you guys know I have not
been a huge fan of the icing on to a kit
but I tried to make it work I kind of
 it up a little bit which you'll
see a little bit sooner on begin the
video but I hope it looks okay in the
end
I kind of messed it up and I was a
little disappointed but that just
teaches you not to put too much on
because no one wants to be walking
around with great muddy cheeks like me
so I'm just contouring around my jawline
my cheeks my nose and my forehead and
just hoping for the best if it doesn't
go money but now when I applied with the
bronzing powder over it it went
extremely muddy look at that I don't
know what happened and then I tried to
fix it by putting some pressed powder
over the top and it went great
it actually went gray and I was like
what else can I do so I just put some
more bronzer over the top and hope to
blend it out and it kind of works but it
doesn't look the best just moving on to
a little bit of blush to bring some
color back to the face and just applying
that on to my little cheeky squats there
oh we're ready to set ah no we're not
setting we're prepping for highlighter
using the Australis makeup setting spray
and then going in with the highlight
highlighter this is not very pigmented
but it's good for the price because it
does give you a nice little glow along
your cheekbones you know keep it slow
and then I'm just taking a little bit of
that banana shade from the AC on to a
kit and just cleaning up my contour
because it was a bit lower and messy and
now for my liquid lipstick this is creme
brulee by Australis obviously and it's a
really nice color I didn't wear it for
long so I can't really tell you how long
wearing it is but it wasn't like
cracking or anything like that but it
went on nicely and the applicator was
good now I'm just setting my whole
entire face and then popping some gloss
over the top I've been loving glossy
looks lately
don't know why but I have been so I'm
just applying that over the top oh and
we're done I hope you guys really
enjoyed this video if you did please
don't forget to give it a massive thumbs
up I love you guys so much and I will
see you all in my next video bye see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
