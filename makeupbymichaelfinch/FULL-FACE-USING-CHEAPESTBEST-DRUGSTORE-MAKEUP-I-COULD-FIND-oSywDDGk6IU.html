channel so today I'm going to be doing a
full face of the cheapest most
affordable at best drugstore makeup that
I own so I pretty much went through
everything and found the cheapest best
products that I own so if you are new
here make sure you have subscribed or if
you enjoy this video make sure you give
it a massive thumbs up and without any
further ado let's get straight into the
video
so as you guys can tell I've already
done my brows off camera just because I
couldn't find something extremely cheap
and I didn't want to put something in
the video that wasn't the cheapest thing
that I could find so I just went ahead
to did them off camera but I'm gonna be
jumping straight into concealer and for
that I'm just gonna be using the LA girl
Pro concealer in the shade porcelain so
I'm gonna be doing my eyes today first
and I'm gonna be using this concealer as
a base for my lids so I'm just taking
this concealer and more so just
concealing under my brow and then I'm
just gonna drag it all the way down on
to my lid to prepare a nice base for my
shadows now this concealer is super full
coverage and extremely extremely
affordable if I say cheap throughout
this video I know people don't get
triggered by it please don't because
that's not what I meant
I've grown up using the word cheap
rather than affordable so we're just
gonna go with whatever comes out of my
mouth then I might just take my damp
Beauty Blender and just blend this out
fully so it's all smooth and ready for
the shadow to be applied then just just
stick that in place I'm just gonna take
the Australis fresh and flawless pressed
powder hands-down best affordable
cheapest drugstore product I could find
that is good regarding foundation powder
whatnot I'm just gonna gently set my
lids okay guys so now moving on to eye
shadow I'm just gonna be taking this
palette from the balm now some people
when I use the balm that comment that
it's not drugstore but it actually is it
sold in Target which is classified as a
lurking a drugstore here in Australia it
used to be sobbing David Jones but I
don't know if it still is either way I
 live for this palette I haven't
really used it much in videos but I have
used it behind things you know so just
driving straight into this palette I'm
just gonna do kind of like a full glare
me sort of look that's what I want to do
so first I'm just gonna take a shade
called bold which is this brown shade
I'm just gonna pop this on the outer
edge of my eye and stop letting it for
my crease these eyeshadows ass are so
pigmented and so blendable and just so
easy to use I love the bomb eye
shadows and I'm gonna gently bring that
in all the way to the inner corner okay
guys so the next shade I'm gonna be
taking is this brown one up here called
Roslin brothel
Roslin brawls gonna take that on this
little fluffy blender brush and just
gently start popping it into my outer
corner really lightly and just kind of
blending it and then straight over the
top of that I'm just gonna take the
shade called brilliant and I'm just
gonna pack that all over my lid and then
it's gonna quickly run around the edge
with that brush and with ducks
whatever's left on that brush from
before and just kind of blend everything
together okay so now I'm moving on to a
winged liner I'm just gonna be taking
the NYC liquid liner now if you are in
Australia they don't sell this in
Australia but you can get it everywhere
online and I definitely know you can get
it from eBay and it's super super cheap
on there sorry yeah but if you're in
America you can pretty much get it from
anywhere and it's the best so I'm just
gonna do a big fuck-off wing as per
usual
for mascara I'm just gonna be using the
essence volume stylist 18-hour lash
extension mascara holy essence
always has the most intense names for
them of scars that's fine now moving on
to lashes I'm just gonna be using these
ones here from I Lua now this is in
collaboration with Vegas nay but I lower
lashes themselves are incredible they
all have like mink style effects and
really like versatile lashes and I have
a huge range same with Adele but for
today we're just gonna be using the eye
lure ones so these are from the Vegas
nay luxe collection and this is in the
style bronze beauty I believe I've just
popped on a little bit of lash glue I'm
just gonna let it dry for like 15
seconds and then I'm just gonna take it
and go straight on oh god okay so this
is this lash on I'm just gonna go ahead
and put the other one on and then we'll
get started on my face okay so getting
started on the face I'm just going to
take the LA girl Pro prep haich-d High
Definition smoothing face primer a
little bit of this now what I like about
this is it's silicone based and it
really gets into your pores it's kind of
tacky and it really sticks to the
foundation it's like and pies are kind
of hard to move around your face they
really were moving on to foundation I'm
just gonna be taking the wet and wild
photo focus foundation in the shade
shell ivory this was 12 Australian
dollars but it's six in America honestly
it's the cheapest one I could find and
it's plainly left right and center I
 live for this foundation it's so
good yeah I think I don't like about it
because there's always something
negative that I need to point out is the
applicator it's like an a spatula you've
gotta like anyway we're just gonna do
just that so I'm just gonna take it that
much so farm and take my damp Beauty
Blender and then I'm just gonna start
learning this or in what I love about
this so much as its buildable you can
build it up and it looks like real skin
it is buildable but you do need a
fuckload if you want like fuller
coverage but for the price of six
dollars twelve dollars whatever it's
 good as you can see I'm just
building out coverage now by adding more
layers and the more you add the better
it is to be honest and it's a thin
consistency it's not like it's thick or
anything like that this is a really good
foundation
but as I said before if you do want
coverage you're just gonna add it on
layer by layer and just slightly blend
and you will get good coverage now I'm
gonna dip back into the LA girl Pro
concealer and I'm just gonna gently
define and conceal the tops of my brows
now I'm sana go straight in with the
foundation and just do my forehead this
is looking pretty good you guys
considering this is all the cheapest
 that I could find alright now that
my face is all done let's move on to
concealer again just gonna sweat this
out on the back of my hand from the tube
his last time I was spraying out
underneath my eyes literally squirted
into my eye and it killed so I'm just
gonna do that's the regular then of
course under the eyes
so I've been letting my concealer sit
here for a while because it gets full of
coverage when you leave it there I
thought it was only with specific
concealers but it's with this one too
because it's very like think I'm like
tacky but it's so blending out which is
perf now to set and bake my under eyes
I'm just gonna be taking the car ds1
powder in the shade translucent extra
coverage this is a bomb diggity dot-com
it's very smoothing doesn't go patchy it
doesn't have any flash back but the only
thing I hate about it because I'm
pointing out the negatives like always
apparently is the packaging is off its
chops like it's just such a show
every single time you open it up and
because this has a little bit of extra
coverage and it like gives a little bit
of extra coverage as it's baking and
this is sorry cheap it's like ten
dollars you can get it from if you're in
America it's like seven dollars maybe I
bought a few when I was in America I
remember how much they were though but
you can get them on eBay and like Ross
cosmetics if you're in Australia and
just places like that they do sell
koichi F fun like everywhere online just
google it and I'm sure there'll be a lot
of places that sell it they don't sell
it in stores in Australia they're cool
now that that's done I'm just gonna take
you astralis fresh and flawless once
again and I'm just gonna set everything
else on my face
oh this is in the shade light beige and
I'm just gonna dab just all onto the
rest of my face this is just more or
less just gonna set all the rest of my
foundation so it locks it into place
because when you use a liquid you've got
to set it with a powder otherwise it'll
slip and slide everywhere like a big
fuck-off slip and slide and we don't
want that
now it's quickly finishing off
underneath my eyes I'm just gonna take
the brown shade that I used before
pretty much putting this right up to my
lash line and then blending it down that
is taking that darker brown almost black
shade I'm just gonna pop a little bit of
that in my outer corner now moving on to
contouring I was gonna be taking the
essence contouring palette and I'm gonna
be using this shade yeah cuz it's
perfect for me and it blends so well so
I'm just gonna dip into a little bit of
that I'm just gonna slowly start
contouring my cheekbones see how like
wow that's blending and it's not too
harsh or anything you can just and it's
very buildable you can add as much or as
less as you want and I
pretty sure this comes in like three
different shades as well around the edge
of my face - just to give the appearance
of a smaller face because I need bat
cannot forget the forehead just gonna
slightly bring this up around and I kind
of dub it into my hairline under the
bottom lip it's gonna slightly contour
my nerves just with the contour powder
we're gonna up into the brow bone brow
bone is that what it's called in that I
don't know hey guys
now moving on to bronzer I'm just gonna
be taking some of the wet and wild
bronze off this is in the shade ticket
to Brazil I think and I'm gonna take a
really generous amount of this just add
it onto my cheeks and this color is
sorry pretty and it's got like a bit of
a gleam - I like a bit of a glow so it
gives you skin a bit of a glory as well
at the same time and this bronzer just
come in like three different shades I
think and I'm also just gonna run that
bronzer all down my necks
I also just added a little bit of bottom
Ascar the essence wand and kind of put a
little bit on my top and bottom lashes
to join everything together now just for
a little bit of color in my cheeks I'm
just gonna be taking the elf blush kit
and I'm just gonna be taking this orange
shade out of it I'm just gonna take my
stippling brush and just stipple a
little bit onto my cheeks
I love this color blush it's like peachy
and like not pink it's like just looks
are nice we're going to highlight out
I'm just gonna be taking the elf
moonlight pearls
highlighter so I like to scrape off the
top layer because then you get the real
pigment like underneath it so I'm just
gonna go in with my brush and I'm just
gonna start building this off now it's
not the most crazy pigment out of my
lighter but for three dollars it does
the job and like it is buildable I'm
just gonna spray a little bit of the elf
mist and set spray just so I can get a
little bit more like intensity with the
highlight if it was just gross patchy
I'm gonna be mad oh there we go
okay you can't complain this is good
wet-and-wild also does amazing
highlighters as well but I'm gonna use
an elf one today because it's more
available my Australian fam so this is
what the highlight looks like so good
I'm also just gonna run a little bit of
this on my nerves bridge might just take
my finger actually I'm gonna whack on a
 ton look at my nose I'm also just
gonna pop a little bit of this highlight
out on the inner corners just to keep
that nice and bright and I'm also just
gonna put a little bit underneath my
brow bone on the brow bar and
whatever now last but not least for my
lips I'm just gonna be using the job
Jonna sweet cream matte liquid lip color
this is in the shade buttercream
frosting this is $3 when I bought it in
America so around $5 Australian and I'm
pretty sure you can get Jordana in
Australia coz I remember when I first
started getting into makeup when I was
younger there's a shop in Australia
called Woolworths and they used to sell
Jordana makeup in Woolworths but I'm
pretty sure they still sell it in like
carry white chemists and all that carry
white terry why who knows it's like a
really pretty pinky nude shade I'm not
even kidding you guys this smells so
identical to the Kylie Jenner liquid
lipsticks oh it smells even better to be
honest now does to set everything in
place
I'm just retaking the Alf mat magic mist
and set you don't need much because it's
a very heavy spray up and there we go
just gonna let this dry off and then
we're done
so this is the completed and finished
look I really hope you guys enjoyed this

went to my cupboard and looked for all
