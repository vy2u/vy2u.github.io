today I decided to do a full face using
only elf cosmetics so for those who
don't know what else is is basically
just a really cheap drugstore affordable
brand here in Australia and I'm pretty
sure it's all over the world as well I
only found it about myself yesterday
morning but elf actually stands for eyes
lips and day we had a known map so I've
got some really cool products here from
Alf and I'm actually really excited to
see what I can do on my face with these
products so without any further ado
let's get straight into it so first of
all I'm just going to be taking this a
brow pencil this is in the shade neutral
brown and I'm just going to start
applying that through my brow this is
got kind of like a seek sort of part
here so it's a bit okay that's good just
created a nice shape so I'm just running
that through my brow getting all those
hairs and getting all those fast areas
in there and it seems to be doing a
pretty good job and then it was flat on
my brow I'm just going to grab that
pencil and kind of like flick upwards
and on the other side it's got a little
like spoolie so you can just brush away
and brush everything into place not bad
guys not bad just taking the bully once
again and really brushing them my brow
hairs are so long I kind of like that
look where they're like stuck up all in
there okay guys let's move on to some
eyebrow powder now the brushes or
majority of the brushes that I'm using
today are actually from else as well so
I'm not taking any like morphe brushes
or Sigma brushes or anything like that
so really quite affordable brushes next
I'm just going to dip in through this
eyebrow kit here and I'm going to take
the powder shade and I'm just going to
run that through my brow removal - I'll
fill in any sparse areas and this will
kind of set that the pencil that I just
used as well especially at the front
here for like blends really well I'm
actually really impressed with this brow
pencil and the powder as well it's from
a very very natural now just you can
seal on my eyebrows and get a base going
through my eye shadow I'm going to take
the out concealer this is in the shade
light and I think it is still a little
bit too dark
for my liking but you know how I do what
we're going to make
work so I'm going to take this little
out little concealer lip brush singer
here and just conceal under both brows
okay
once that's done it's going to kind of
drag that down now before I do my eyelid
so that can feel I'm just going to go
and wet my elf beauty sponge here and
clean because it's really dirty so BRB
now that it is all that I'm just going
to take that same concealer and I'm just
going to pop that all over my lid area
actually my whole iron fracture
like just a generous amount I'm not sure
how coverage with this goes but we'll
soon find out so I'm just going to go
straight in for it and blend this
concealer are cool okay now just before
that gives a chance to crease on the
time taken of the elf invisible
translucent setting powder I guess and
just stress that so it does not move now
for my eye shadow I'm going to be taking
the elf blushing beauty eye shadow quad
and I'm going to take the crease shade
on this elf blending brush here and I'm
just going to pop that straight in my
crease hey it's blending out very well
I have usin Alki shadow color before but
it was a different one and honestly it's
not even that bad nothing too dramatic
today guys just quite mellow on the
crease on the lid you know and of course
just the same on the other eye
now we're going to take a little bit of
a shade called line and I think it's
actually called line but it says line on
it and I'm just going to pop that on
that out of the it's just going to cut a
darken it ever so slightly which is what
we need a little bit more darkness up in
this crease area just the time these are
really pigmented by the way guys you
don't need too much over now for my lid
color I'm just going to spray a little
bit of the elf mist and set spray on
this laptop rush here which is an elf
one and then I'm just going to dip into
the shade called lid which is like this
pink shade I'm just going to pop that
all over my lid area okay it doesn't
show up very well nothing too dramatic
really quite like simple but I'm going
to go dramatic every other time I'm just
going to take a makeup light and just
clean off all that excess powder and I'm
just going to
are underneath and straight off the side
of my eye now it is time for liquid
liner I'm just going to take the expert
liquid liner by Alf and I'm just gonna
not talk when I do this and I'll let you
know what I think of it when I'm done so
we go
guys I'm actually not joking this liquid
liner is so easy to control and start
easy to use it I honestly think it's a
dupe for the a benefit magic ink liner
which is one of my favorite liquid
liners ever but this honestly does the
same job it's dried black it's not
patchy it's pretty much subscribe Maps
yes drives Maps okay so that liner has
has made me super happy and I'm really
happy with this video so far moving on
to the face I'm going to be I'm going to
be what the about ah just
transferred all up there that's fine
okay so moving that's the face I'm going
to take the mineral infused face primer
and I'm just going to square this
our support feels good feels like it's
doing something it kind of sounds like a
breast implant the kind of smells like
that when you go get like fillers with
Botox or like injections or something
and like it smells like really clean in
that back room that's what this time is
my black but it feels like it's doing
something okay guys so for foundation
today I've got this foundation by Alf
and this is in the shade buff I think
this is one of their latest ones and
it's so dark so what I am going to do is
I still want to use it but I'm going to
be mixing it with some mud and makeup
design long-lasting foundation now I
tried to spend a few videos ago and I
really quite liked it and this is quite
a light color so this will really
lighten up the foundation it's the
cheapest foundation that I could find
that I could mix with this you can get
this in Big W if you're in Australia I
think Big W and like a few other places
is I'm just going to take a little bit
of the elf and like guys I throw down
and then I'm going to mix in some a disc
foundation as well I'm sorry I tried to
make it all out but this is the only
thing I promise so four squared for that
too and I'm going to give her a stir up
I think this is going to be still way
too dark it's pretend that I'm tan guys
pretend that I'm can because I ain't
getting no Marc Jacobs
remarkable to make this like that that
would just
ruin the whole point of this
video okay I'm just going to apply this
all over my face
okay so it's definitely not my color
but we're going to make it work so I'm
going to take my off sponge again I'm
just going to put a little bit of
product on that but doesn't soak it up
too much and I'm just going to start
blending this all end now I can't really
give you a true judgment of the owl
foundation simply because I did mix it
with a another one but these mixed
together a pretty good okay the overall
thought I don't think it's too bad it's
probably light to medium coverage
maybe full I can't really tell okay now
I'm going to take that ELF concealer I
used earlier to do my eye base for my
eye shadow and I'm just going to kind of
put that in the areas where I would
normally cook and seal up you guys know
I love a really painting like white
highlight but but but lololo this
would've get it I can't talk and talk
this will just give us a little bit of
extra coverage around these areas rather
than highlighting the same and now I'm
just going to do under my eyes I really
wish this was a little bit lighter I can
unstoppable in G now because I've want
to write me in the comments right oh my
god you win so much bitch do you want me
to taste this is good or not exactly I'm
kidding but only people in the
commodores like finally a video where
you didn't wind about something what
limits if you're alive by I'm just going
to take my sponge again and I'm just
going to blend all this concealer art
just being careful not to cover up your
wing because I'm a very very big culprit
I just did it okay looking good
okay so now to set everything in place
I'm sort of back with that invisible
loose setting powder and I'm just going
to pop that under my eyes
oh don't inhale this burns you know and
I'm just going to bake my whole nose
like I normally do and then there's the
parts where I can feel natus to set the
rest of my foundation I'm going to take
this transyl learnt translucent
transparent translucent powder pressed
powder and just on this little elf
sponge here and I'm just going to set
everything else by pressing
because you can't if you set your
foundation life is really going to set
up so well because it's such a dense
like compacted in your face if you just
start over with a brush probably won't
work as well okay guys so I'm just
transitioning into voiceover because
it's hot and I had to blast my
fan so I'm just dusting off all of that
bake and then we are going into the
mascara this mascara wasn't the greatest
mascara I've ever used but it's still
you know covered my lashes but it just
didn't really stick in the more length
in them it just kind of put a little
black on them then for these lashes
these are just the elf lashes and I'm
just sticking them on they're a little
bit hard to stick on kesab and so like
loose but anyway they worked out now
moving on to contouring this is the
Alpha little contour kit and it's not
very pigmented but you can go ham on it
and it does create a bit of a contour as
you can see and so I'm just contrary at
my forehead as well at trying to make it
look a little bit smaller because it's
not happening
it's not working contouring the other
side of my face and just a little bit
down the sides of my nose also and can't
forget the jaw line if you are
me can't forget the jaw line you know
moving on to blush I'm just taking a
little bit of this peachy toned blush
from the out blush palette and just
popping a little bit on my cheek so it's
for a little flush of color looks so
nice and then just a little bit of that
brown eyeshadow straight underneath my
eye look at my mouth it looks like Oh as
if everyone doesn't pull that face
though real talk honestly and then I'm
just putting a little bit of mascara
over those fake lashes and obviously my
bottom lashes as well then I'm just
setting my set setting my face I'm just
printing a little bit of the six plus
alpha version on my face and then the
highlighter I'm using is the elf
highlighter I forget the shade but I
will leave it down below it is so good
like a lot of people do say that they
love this highlighter because it
actually is so good like it's so good
you have to scratch the top layer of it
off for it to work properly because
underneath all that it's got you know
the good sheer
my lip color this is the elf it's like a
matte lip crayon I guess it kind of
reminds me it's torn by
of colors just not in a liquid lipstick
form it's a really nice color I do like
it and I feel like it really went with
this whole look that I've got going on
here and then I'm going to take some
more of the mist and set setting spray
and set my whole face anyway guys this
is the completed look I hope you guys
did enjoy this video if you did please
don't forget to give it a massive thumbs
up because it will help me out a lot I'm
sorry that little second like last part
of this video was a voiceover that's
just because it's hot right now
and I had to blast the fan otherwise
this will just all sweat off now I don't
know why but this up here has gone or
really patchy lack of a contour just on
this side here maybe I put too much on I
don't know it's setting for a person to
ever to dry anyway I really hope you
guys did enjoy this video if you have
any video requests please do feel free
to leave them down below and I'll be
happy to add them to my list anyway guys
I love you all so much and I'll see you
all in my next video bye
