today I'm going to be filming a full
face using only essence and makeup now I
haven't actually tried much efforts
before in my life so I've got a
time of essence here and I want to see
if I can do kind of like a full glam
sort of look pray to God with me because
essence is a very very very affordable
brand and doesn't mean that no
though
I never said that so um let's get
straight into it
okay so I'm going to start off with my
eyebrows first and I'm going to be
taking the essence eyebrow gel color and
shape and this is in the shade 0-1 Brown
and it looks extremely extremely dark
well we're just going to go with it
because it's the only one I've got
so just on my angled brush I'm just
going to go straight underneath my brow
as I normally would so it's kind of
blending away into nothing but it's
working you know it's it's doing
something I'm just going to brush
through that now it's going to go to the
front of my brow and kind of like do
these little lines to get a kind of
natural shape my eyebrow hairs are so
long at the start so I've been loving
that whole like brushed up brow look not
like the whole really defined brow still
defined that like not really defining
what I mean
let's go for a natural sort of I love
that so much how it's like looks really
natural sort of thing well I love love
love now I'm just going to take the
essence make me brow eyebrow gel mascara
and this is in the shade over brownie
Browns and I'm just going to run this
through my hairs and this should make oh
yeah good good this should just 10 all
the blonde hairs and you know gives them
a bit more color and filling all those
like little sparse areas that I've got
going on moving on to concealer I'm
going to be taking the essence
camouflage full coverage concealer I
love it when it says full coverage any
concealers blaze the best thing ever
and this is in the shade ivory 0-5 and
I'm just going to put this under my brow
or so I'm just going to pack on that
concealer underneath there then I'm
going to take any flat top brush and
kind of push it up against the arm
bottom of my brow just to kind of like
conceal it
clean up those edges a little bit and
then I'm just going to kind of pull that
down halfway down my eyelid I'm not
going to bring it all the way down yet
because I need to do the flower I don't
want that creasing on me I
forgot to wear my Beauty Blender bitch
I'm sort of going to wet this then I'll
be Attic okay now I'm just going to take
more of that full coverage concealer and
put that all over my lid area they call
we're going to use this as a base for
our shadow today just you know putting
this all over here and the concealer
that I applied before kind of oxidized a
little bit already fine okay now I'm
just going to take my sponge and blend
away pull in a blend and blend and this
is blending out very nicely it's not you
know leaving it's not the sponges and so
soaking up too much concealer which is
what I want okay now I'm just going to
take the essence and mattifying compact
powder and I'm just going to set my lids
with that so nothing creases okay so
moving on to eye shadow I've got the
essence all about nudes eye shadow
palette and this is just a neutral
eyeshadow palette I guess what I'm going
to do is I'm going to dip into this
color here where is that matte or
shimmery in a Kanto actually I'm not
going to take that I show a palette
first essence actually just came out
with these and you like little Z palette
scenes and I've got four here all
different colors and you basically just
put them in yourself so you buy the
singles and then you put them into the Z
palette so I'm going to take this white
shade here and I'm kind of just going to
pop that Orlac over on my eyelid just so
there's like some more powder for all
our shadows to blend out with I'm just
going to blend that through my crease
very mic release through my
crazy speed a blending up Russo looks
absolutely setting Gorge now I'm just
going to take that eye shadow from that
palette and I'm just going to put that
through my crease as kind of like a
transition sort of shade where is that
come on don't do this Jimmy okay well
that is obviously not going to work so
I'm just going to dip into this brown
shade here that I've made out of my this
little Z palette singer and I'm going to
that in my out of the hoping it has some
more pigmentation which it does so
that's just going to go in and out of
the area and I'm going to kind of blend
it up towards the outer V of my eye
sorry to the point of my brow they do
blend out really nicely so the blend
ability and the build ability of this is
a very good so far like it's not
blending away when I put more on which
is exactly what I need
alright so the next color I'm going to
take is this a black out of this palette
here this is another little Z palette
and I'm just going to take this on a
small little just finer brush and I'm
really excited to see how black and like
pigmented this is and see like the
quality of it and see if it doesn't
blend away or you know what I really
think this is going to work I'm just
going to bring it through my little
caught up here okay and then I'm going
to go back in with that other brush that
I used previously and that brown color
that I first just put down just to blend
out that black color yes ah essence
 me up today I love it okay I'm
just going to add some more black to my
out of V to make a really pigment turn
which is what we want and I'm just going
to blend that browner a little bit more
over those edges so it's all blended and
nice also I just saw this like metallic
II sort of brown color and this other
pilot up lights like a shimmery Brown
I'm gonna put this on my eyelid today
looks so pigmented look at that cool
just because it's pigmented it doesn't
mean it's going to work well I'm just
going to take a flat top brush and I'm
going to spritz it with the instant
matte makeup setting spray from essence
know if it's fluff up in here today
around this bitch and then we're going
to dip it back into that the brown
bronzy sort of color that I just showed
you guys I'm just going to pop this all
over my lid okay it doesn't apply as
well as I thought it was going to it'll
make it oh yeah that's good well well
we're getting heaps and fallout now I'm
going to take that brush that I had with
the black before and kind of just Pat
the black over the edges to the best of
what the shadows are going to let me
blend it to found another color that I
might just pop on the middle of my
eyelid just to see if this brightens it
up a little bit in the mid
oh yeah for my eyeliner wings today I'm
going to be using the superfine eyeliner
pen and what I'm going to do is just
pull this actually gives you a really
nice sharp you know application holy

okay this it's probably not the best
wing but there's wing number one done
now I'm just going to do the side okay
so that eyeliner pen is probably my new
favorite drugstore it is so good
it dries well and it doesn't transfer
look at this black and it's such a fine
pinpoint okay guys now we're just going
to move on to the rest of the eyes I
want to get the eyes done I'm going to
be using the essence volume stylist
taking our lash extension mascara I see
a lot of people talk about essence
mascaras and how good they are and
honestly this is pretty actually good
I mean it's doing pretty much what every
other mascara would do it's thickened
them it's black in them it's lengthened
them doing all the right things on now
because essence does not do a lashes at
least in Australia identic Dedra I'm
just going to pop some on off camera and
I'll be right back and we'll do the base
okay now that my lashes are on I'm just
going to take some more of that a
mascara and just pop that over the top
just to kind of blend my natural lashes
with the falsies okay
so now for my face essence does not have
any primers or at least I could not find
any and I looked in three different
shops so I'm just gonna set I'm just
going to split my face with some of the
makeup setting spray kind of to use as
like a base I guess okay so moving on to
a foundation I'm going to be using the
essence day or day 16 hour long lasting
liquid foundation this is in the shade
20 soft nude so this is the closest one
I could find to my skin tone so I'm just
going to start by applying this all over
my face and then afterwards I'm going to
go in and blend it out with a Beauty
Blender
we're so it's very sick which is good
cause I like sick once that is all
across the eye bottom half of my face
I'm just going to take my sponge and
proto glad that this blends out really
well
not that it's actually blending out so
well and covering everything up suit up
super good I'm just going to take that
same foundation and just kind of conceal
across the top of my brows now just to
do my big old a jolly as forehead
just trying to avoid my hairline because
if you get foundation in your hairline
when you have like literally white hair
you cooked am just gonna blend this out
as well I'm also just going to take a
bit more of that foundation and just
apply it in my problem areas I can build
up that coverage a little bit more and
already this is oxidizing a lot I don't
know if you guys can tell but in person
you can tell a lot moving back on to
conceal arts you highlight my face I'm
just going to take that same concealer
we use for our eyes today highlighting
the t-zone in the middle of my face
noted one this baby arm that blends out
quite well
okay and now so just highlight
underneath my eyes with that same
concealer once again I'm just going to
take the absolute out of it okay
I'm going to blend this side and see how
this scar is
I splendid out well and it's done an
actually a really good job I like it
obviously the same on this I here and
blending this all out as well
I'm just going to apply a little bit
more just under the eye area to brighten
that a little bit more okay now to bake
my under eyes I'm going to use the
little Beauty angels color correcting
anti darkness loose setting powder
that's a name now I open this the other
day and it is it kind of looks like a
lilac color but I guess that comes under
the concept of the color correcting I
guess so I'm just going to see it's like
a purpley light other than you guys can
see but I'm it's like a purpley lilac
color and I'm just going to press it in
just just set that concealer okay so now
to set the rest of my sound dilatation
I'm going to take the essence mattifying
compact powder just on this big-ass
brush I'm just going to tap it all over
my face you want to tap because if you
swell and stuff you might move the
foundation and everything underneath and
all your hard work will be put in the
band pretty much and I'm just kind of
wiping off that under I've baked as we
go okay so now I'm just going to do my
under eye area and I'm going to take the
first brown shade that I used and I'm
just going to put that straight
underneath my waterline now it's going
to switch to this little blending brush
and kind of just blend that Brown yeah
to make it a little bit smoky okay now
just taking that a black shade again
which is a really good black by the way
I'm just going to pop that in my out of
the and kind of all the way across and
just blending out that black with
somewhat of the brown just kind of
bringing it down a bit lower now for my
waterline I did say I want to make this
full a glam so I am going to take is the
extreme a lasting eye pencil easy glide
and waterproof black love essence
eyeliner pen and I'm just going to pop
this in my waterline
and it's so creamy and applies very well
in its super black wow I'm impressed
with this overall look and how it's
going okay so now to contour I'm going
to take the shape your face contouring
palette right here and I'm going to take
this shade just here and I'm just going
to dip into that I'm actually really
loving these products like each time I
apply on my fall like this actually
looks good this is such a nice color for
me it's blending well it's not muddy
well I'm just kind of bringing it up and
kind of blending over the edge of the
consumer as well the bronzer will help
with that afterwards but so now we're
just going to contour our little hearts
off can't forget the big old jolly
forehead want to kind of condense this
down a little bit so it's oh wow and
your face you could land an airplane on
there you know what I mean
can't forget to contour the jaw line a
bit and I'm just going to kind of bring
up around my chin here so it kind of
creates this little shape here and I'm
just going to run a little bit down the
side of my nose not too much just a
little bit okay now to bronze I'm just
going to take the luminous matter
bronzing powder this is for a lighter
skin so I'm assuming someone like moi
and I'm just going to dip into this but
what's very powdery and pigmented and
I'm just going to pop that on my cheeks
so it's got a lot of gall o to it like a
lot of luminosity but that's fine it's
not too intense you know what I mean but
I'm just going to take that around the
rest of my forehead to kind of give you
that jewelry skin sort of look which I
don't mind okay now for my blush I'm
just going to take the satin touch blush
in the shade 0-3 satin bronze so it's
kind of just like a bonder I guess but
it was the only blush that they had in
store that was you know appealing to me
the others are like way too pink so I
was going to put a little bit as item
most cheeks as well this will just kind
of bronze up everything a bit more just
cool I'm cool with that
I am just going to run through my brows
again with that
make me brow gel why's there hair
everywhere I got off and just kind of
stick these up a little bit more because
during the process of powdering and
everything that kind of went out of
whack but i'ma just bring him back to
life you know watch okay cool oh we need
a highlight
okay I'm just going to take that setting
spray again just kind of spritz the
slides on my face now to highlight I'm
just going to take the blossom dreams
rainbow highlighter
mm-hm and I'm just going to like dip
into that I guess and kind of this oh
yeah well is that honest a few Beverly
Hills and moonchild it's like a
holographic highlighter I'm not really a
fan of the whole rainbow a highlighter
singer but it's what we've got today and
it's what we're going to work for it
okay just a little bit on the nose Ridge
because it is a purple helada like
holographic we don't want to make
ourselves look like the Tin Man you know
okay and now for lips I do not have a
lip liner because I forgot to
buy one but I do have a lipstick and
this is the long-lasting essence liquid
lipstick in the number 28 it's like a
nice brown not I hate that yeah I'm
taking it off that's what it's
disgusting and instead it for my lips
