channel sorry today I'm going to be
doing a video of a full face using only
Instagram hacks now I've seen this
Instagram hacks all over the Instagram
habit tips to teams to grab I love
Instagram so much I love looking at all
the videos on there all the photos on
there they just entertain me so much so
I thought what a good idea to do a full
face of makeup using only Instagram
hacks and kind of putting them to the
test at the same time yeah when I
thought of this idea I was like I wonder
if anyone else has done this idea and
they have so I will leave a few of my
favorites down by thing there's only one
all true that I could find a full face
challenge doing exactly what I'm doing
now so I'll leave them down below and
you can go check them out as well other
than that let's get straight into the
video I'm so excited to do this and test
these out myself so let's do it so the
first half that I want to try out is
apparently if you mix aloe vera gel and
some moisturizers together it makes a
primer and what that's meant to do is
it's meant to make your skin looking
chewy but without the oily finish so
don't know how that's going to go
because I pack on powder regardless of
what I use so I'm going to take this
little dish here and you meant to just
put in a dollop of aloe vera gel so
about that much you can see how much is
in there and then just a little bit of
moisturizer as well now I'm going to
give that a little scary uppy that looks
rank as sorry what I'm gonna do is
just get some you may need a little bit
of primer unless you like to go ham on
the primer and I'm just going to rub
that into my skin it honestly feels like
a cry my life obviously not silicone
based but it feels just like a primer
it's quiet soothing now that I think
about it coz of the aloe vera and it's
pretty much almost dried already so now
that my hands out of my face let's go on
to the next hack so this next hat I have
seen absolutely everywhere and I'm
pretty sure a girl named Karina Garcia
invented it or it was her twin sister I
always get them confused anyway
basically you just take a sock you know
and sock this is a clean sock never been
used before so don't stress I think
you're meant to like invert the sock
into itself I don't know but what this
is meant to be used for is a Beauty
Blender and I don't think you meant to
wet it so you meant to just pop your
foundation on with a
sock so they're starting some foundation
all over my face in preparation to blend
this out with a sock so I'm just going
to take my little trusty sakya and just
start blending this out okay well we've
got a lot of the products stuck on the
sock well okay I mean it's working but
it's very patchy and like see what I
mean
what if I Devin this a little bit jerkin
that'll work well if I'd ended this a
little bit better at my work a bit
better let's give it a shot
so take some mac fix+ on my sock oh yeah
it's not as dry okay okay so I'm all
about that flawless foundation
application and this is just not doing
the trick for me today job well I would
definitely not recommend a sock to blend
out your foundation house it takes half
a man up in the socks oh so the
next hack is baking with actual baking
soda or baby powder or talcum powder or
any sort of powder like that that you
cook with or that you put on a baby's
asshole I don't really know
so actually I'm just going to pop on my
concealer as usual and just highlight my
face and I am going to be blending this
out with the sock to see if that you
know wants to help anymore probably not
I mean it's blending it up but lack not
good enough it's taking half it off
anyway okay so once all that concealer
is blended out let's put this hack to
the test so I just got a little bit of a
baking powder in this little dish here
and I'm just going to dip my Beauty
Blender straight into that and straight
up underneath Matt it's just even
working what is happening could I just
take all my concealer off boy that looks
so dodgy no kidding and you are getting
me off had 2% dug in now
oh I'm just going to be taking some on a
big fluffy brush and attempting to set
the rest of my face
sorry myself I'm not talking when I'm
doing this anymore
that actually tastes like dead cow the
next tab is taking some cocoa powder to
contour with and use as eyeshadow so
just got my cocoa powder on this little
lid here and I'm just going to take a
contouring brush and tap off the extra
 that you don't need and I'm just
gonna
straighten my floors really was it a chi
Faced chocolate Soleil obviously like 99
percent cocoa powder I think oh my god
bit muddy bit money but that can be
blended and fixed so with this a little
goes along a long way that this hack is
actually working so I guess this is kind
of going to be used as a bronzer and a
contour I'm just going to take a little
bit more baking powder and just try to
bake under that contour just to clean it
up a little bit you're highly doubt
sister work now to test this out as eye
shadow just taking that through a marker
love this
and you know what guys this actually
blends out quite nice you know what guys
I would actually say that this hack
works cocoa powder fire shadow and
contour
BAM you've won mirror bubbles sorry this
next hack I see all the time of the
Instagram all the time and I've wanted
to try it but I'm scared to try this one
so I'm just going to be taking some
facial oil just any sort of oil and I
see people put this where they highlight
to make that hi laptop a little bit more
severely so I literally just see them
take some of the oil on the high point
to their face top up with their finger
luckiest yeah that's taken off half of
my foundation or a problem now I'm just
going to take my highlighter and brush
straight over the top
oh yeah it's pretty cakey know what
let's actually work pretty well let's do
the rest of my face and let's not drink
any on this cheek because I don't see
the difference
oh my god it didn't work as well look at
the difference well okay well I would
definitely say this hat is it yes but it
does kind of move your foundation
underneath that's okay though you can
just pass on the highlighter and you'll
be fine
so this next hack that I want to do is a
hashtag on the corner of your eye to
create an instant smoky eye now or you
get a little bit of shadow on there just
ignore that okay so what I'm going to do
is take a black eyeliner pencil and just
draw a hashtag will try to oh I'm really
not
hashtags on their face okay so there's
my hashtag and then what your mintages
take a clean blending brush and blend
that out and then you've got an instant
smoky eye so my attempt with that you
know what I reckon this would actually
work if you use a pencil that was more
wet rather than more dry so I should
have researched that but honestly I
think this would work if I didn't use
such a dry pencil so the next hack is
what probably a lot of you are seen is
just taking a credit card or any sort of
card this is is a drinks card or a
freight entry to lock machine in
Melbourne hashtag not sponsored but I
just gotten this lying around so I'm
like meddling is that because my wallets
in the car a copy are you having to
get up isn't that lazy so what
you meant to do is you just grab your
credit card and then you just do like
this don't raise your forehead like I'm
oh you know what actually not that bad
but you know what that actually just
gives you quite a nice precise line
obviously it's very thick but if you're
a beginner with eyeliner this or sticky
tape will help you out a lot so the next
hack that I want to talk about is using
vaseline or a lip balm on your eyelashes
before applying it mascara cuz
apparently that makes them a lot thicker
so I'm just taking some of this
chapstick on my mascara wand this isn't
this is a clean empty mascara and by the
way guys okay so let's do it on this
side so I'm just brushing that chapstick
through my eye lashes and it's sticking
to them quite well now time for a little
bit of mascara to put this to the test
I'm gonna do this one first there's that
I dunno let's try this one well you know
what can you guys see the difference
this is the eye with no moisturizer lip
balm stuff and this is what I weird
you see difference I reckon it's they're
much thicker and they don't look clumpy
either well that's actually actually
that's actually work I'm actually really
impressed the only thing I'd be worried
about is this transferring on to my eyes
later because it's kind of wet
underneath that dinosaur dry properly
but who's to know I'm not leaving this
on volume at all I want to get this
off my face immediately so for the next
half you're just going to need some
liquid lipstick or regular lipstick and
some scotch tape or sticky tape
apparently if you put stick
tape around your lips it's gonna give
you a perfect lip line when you put your
lipstick on dad
literally I you not my lips are
that big I don't know if this tap I put
too much foundation on this okay
just ain't gonna work but we're gonna
give it a shot
look it's literally just say up it's
gone okay so it's gonna come straight
off so what I'm going to do is just hold
the down this is not sticking at
all slower on the scanner can't help
that like well that's amazing I would
definitely say majority people majority
of people who do their makeup to their
lips last and this would not be
convenient for someone like I honestly
don't think this is gonna work for
anyone at all now let's try it decide
without the tape wow that looks much
better doesn't it so I would say this
hack is a fail and waste of time so the
next hack that I want to talk about is
putting any highlighter
over any lipstick to make it look
metallic so I'm going to stick with this
lipstick that I've got on right now and
this is almost dry so I'm just going to
take some of my highlighter
oh the lips oh yeah okay off this
actually works and it actually looks
good this hackers works oh my god you
guys I'm sorry impressed with majority
of these hacks like some of them
actually work so well I'm just gonna
dust off this bake I just got it in my
mouth again
oh I would honestly have to say my
favorite turd a tweet what is oh it's
the highlighter look how muddy that
looks oh I'll have to say my most
favorite true hacks out of today's video
is definitely the Vaseline stuff before
mascara and the highlighter over any
lipstick to make it look metallic sorry
that is the end of today's video I hope
you guys learn from you today or you
learn a little new hack if you did don't
forget to give me a thumbs up subscribe
if you on you I love you guys so much
and I'll see you all in my next video
