I am now back with a a blue a black
black round fuck me I've had enough and
back with a blue background and I'm
loving it I thought the yellow was kind
of ugly it was kind of coming up green
on camera and it just didn't look good
at all so I'm back with a blue
background once again so in today's
video I'm gonna be trying out a bunch of
makeup that I bought when I was in Hong
Kong now for those who don't know I went
to Hong Kong a few weeks ago so I went
to this store called FAFSA I believe in
that has like all different different
brands of makeup ones that I've never
really seen before they did have like
Maybelline and Revlon in there but I
decided to get stuff today and stuff
from brands that I didn't even know
about or haven't even tried before so
I've got a full face in here this was
around for $350 $400 all up so yeah
apparently a lot of the products in here
I really really good I was talking to
some of the people that worked at the
store and they said um I chose the right
stuff for this the videos sorry without
any further ado let's get straight into
it
okay so I'll have everything laid out in
front of me I'm actually really excited
because some of these things like ice
watch the highlighted when I was in
straw and it came out really really good
so the first thing I'm gonna go in with
is the caked eyebrow pencil I have no
idea what shade this is in but this is
what it looks like right so I'm just
gonna go straight in and start filling
in my brows
oh yeah that's working exactly the same
as the benefit processing my brow pencil
okay sorry to set my eyebrows in place
they didn't really have any eyebrow
setting powders and such so I'm gonna go
ahead and take this brown eyeshadow from
this palette here called cyber colors
now the guy that was working there said
that these are the best fuck is that
noise so that these are the best quality
eyeshadows so I'm excited to try these
on the eyes but for now I'm just gonna
fill my brows in with it this video is
long over GI got back from Hong Kong a
long time ago but you know I've had my
master classes on and I've been in
Sydney and I've been in Melbourne but
everything's being kind of hectic so I'm
just getting around to it now but it's
being done and I'm really excited to do
it because these products actually look
really good not bad despise shatters
sorry pigmented now to get my brows nice
and concealed I'm gonna be taking the
cyber colours conceal and correct kit
right here now I believe this has three
different shades of concealer and it's
sir we're gonna use this to conceal
under the eyes as well harshly it goes
well so this isn't here I'm just gonna
dip into the middle shade and mix it
with a little bit of this shade here
it's thick okay that actually did a
really good job at concealing it feels
really sticky though but we'll see how
it sets afterwards
all right now it's gonna take that
concealer and just pop it all over my
whole entire lid space like getting it
in there and then I'm just going to take
my damp Beauty Blender and kind of just
blend this all out it's so hot it's not
hot it's like a windy in Brisbane today
and it was just raining a second ago but
like it's just muggy and sticky and it's
really not nice weather to be filming in
walls I can say is thank God for fans
because my aircon just doesn't work and
it's just cooked it's shit up so okay
guys now to set that in place I'm just
gonna be taking this EXO EXO color
combos powder foundation and I'm just
gonna run that across my lid just to set
everything everything so far has been
pretty good but just remember we're only
on eyebrows so it could all go
pear-shaped very quickly okay guys now
moving on to eye shadow I'm gonna be
taking these three pallets here I've got
this one that I just used before and
then also just one and it's from the
same brand as their cyber colors or
color combos so I'm gonna dip into this
one first I'm just gonna take this brown
shade just chooses a bit of a transition
you know and I'm just gonna pop that
into my crease pigments good
it's blending really well and I'm just
gonna kind of blend that up into my eye
exact same on this eye here just kind of
a windshield wiper motion the fuck out
of this right now
y'know by the way please ignore this big
fuck-off pimple oh and it's not my
missing nail as well but are you
surprised oh it's just like a regular
thing for me to have a missing now now I
guess so means to it so now I'm gonna go
back into this eye shadow palette here
and just on the same brush I'm just
going to take that brown color that I
used to fill in my brows and I'm just
gonna pop that into my outer-v
not as pigmented as always expecting to
be fuck its whacking and we're gonna
make it work okay so I'm pretty sure
this is as good as we're going to get
pigmentation wise so we're just gonna go
it with this I'm just gonna dip back
into this eyeshadow palette and take
this gold shade here but I think I'm
gonna need a mix it with a little bit of
six-plus anyway because it's just really
patterning okay guys sir my dad just
called me I was talking to me about a
few things but during that I tested out
the gold eyeshadow nah it does not like
it shows up well but like it's very non
buildable and it's very like chunky and
textured I don't like it anyway going
back into this palette here I'm just
going to take this black shade and what
I'm gonna do a smoky wing I don't really
know if it's gonna work all that well
but we're just gonna give it a whirl
probably forgot that I had a liquid
eyeliner this is the fine point of it
it's from color combos once again okay
so this wings actually worked out pretty
good this is such a fine point it's kind
of really fun and it's kind of hard to
work with but we're making it work you
guys know how hard it is to do wings on
camera for me so I'm gonna go ahead and
read this one and I'll be right back
okay now that my wings are done I'm
gonna move on to mascara just by a brand
called poopa pu PA mascara
vamp sorry let's see how this packaging
is very chic working at
I had and apply this okay so this is
literally just adding a little black
chin to my lashes it's not thickening
them and it's not getting every lash
lace you want a natural look definitely
but this is this isn't for me dull this
look is definitely not gonna be about
the eyes it's gonna be all about the
face but for lashes I have these two
sets here I've got these ones and Indy's
ones so I'm gonna stick these on and I
even went to the extent of getting
eyelash glue sorry we're gonna see how
this lash glue glows this is lash glue
goes this is black as well okay so
that's very natural-looking sorry I
think I'm gonna stack a few pairs up oh
this actually comes with lash glue in
here I have no idea what that says in
the back but I'm just hoping it's latex
free so I'm just gonna let this dry and
then I'm gonna stick it on okay guys so
now that my eyelashes are on so I just
ended up stacking two pairs on top of
each other they're not really my style
but we're just gonna work with it and
see how it all goes now primer I'm
pretty sure I bought one here it is so
this is what the primer is in medium
makeup base okay let's give this a whirl
I swear to God if any of this breaks me
out bad ha oh my god it's like a
consistency is literal water no worries
oh gosh it smells like glue literally
like water okay that's all good now time
for foundation the foundation I've got
is from a brand called Kate Tokyo secret
skin that makers zero foundation this is
in the shade zero six now this is the
only shade that was very close to my
skin tone it's probably way too light
but so I'm just going to squirt this out
oh my god it is literally what it is
literally white Wow
that's fine we're gonna hash tag make it
work so I'm just gonna dot this all over
okay we're just gonna go with that first
and then I'll take my damp Beauty
Blender add a little bit more to it and
then just go to town and blend this out
and see how it all goes
actually you know what this is my color
because I've got zero a tan on right now
this is perfect like it's literally my
exact color pretty much amazing this is
actually really nice it actually looks
like skin which is really nice and I
found
when a foundation looks like skin I'm
just gonna keep adding more and see if I
can build up coverage to make it full
coverage cuz we ain't here for no
neutral books okay so this is probably
medium to full coverage I'm just kind of
looking at it the viewfinder like mmm it
definitely looks like real skin there
like it literally looks like I've got no
makeup on in person it does I don't know
what the camera is picking up but it
looks good okay so right now I'm just
blending out my forehead and I said it
once and I'm gonna say it again
I'm really impressed with how this is
working and building and blending up and
the fact that it's literally the perfect
color for me right now oh we have
another concealer here that I'm gonna
try this is from the brand Krupa Milano
so I'm guessing it's made in Milan made
in Germany eh that's in Milan isn't it
Milan's in Germany I don't know I'm not
one to talk about geography and stuff
like that because I don't even know what
I'm talking about half the time so I'm
gonna try this pooper cover cream
concealer sounds funny puh-puh-puh there
oh there it is now this is the lightest
shade that I could get and it's quite
dark but we're gonna make it work coz my
friend I've had enough I'm just gonna
blend this in okay guys sorry I'm now
just concealing with this pen okay and
I'm just gonna blend it out with my body
looking blender not bad okay now it's
gonna bake with this translucent powder
this is from the brand color combos
again
into the lid oh all that stinks and now
I'm gonna get my Beauty Blender in and
just kind of baked under my eyes this is
a very very finely milled oh my god it's
going everywhere
whoo I'm just gonna let that sit there
for a bit and I'll be back
okay now let's going back to that powder
foundation that I used earlier to set my
lids I'm just going to set the rest of
my face with this just so my foundation
is all locked in and I can pack other
products on top of it without having a
whole move around and stick to the
foundation now let's do a little bit of
contouring I'm gonna be taking the poopa
contouring and strobing a ready for
selfie contour powder palette so in here
we have four different things we've got
two contours and
highlighter and then a shimmery
highlighter so I'm going with my
dome-shaped contouring brush and I'm
gonna go in with this shade here top it
off okay
I'm actually gonna get a little bit of
this color shade here probably a little
bit too warm for me
oh no maybe this colors too warm for me
maybe I should stick to this one
now I'm gonna take the matte shade out
of this palette and I'm gonna pop this
under my eyes just to see if it
brightens it at all it's not doing
anything maybe very slightly bring that
down into a triangle and kind of just up
the side and I'm also just gonna use it
to clean up underneath my contour a
little bit kind of gives a little bit
more coverage as well which is good just
for a little bit of color in my cheeks
I'm just gonna take this blush that I've
got yeah just from the same brand I've
been using this whole entire time this
is the color that he saw it's kind of
like a bronzer looking shade I'm just
gonna pop this on my cheeks oh shit that
was a bit much this is more of like a
bronzer rather than a blush but that's
okay cuz we can use it to bronze and
blush now I also have some makeup
setting spray here that I'm gonna be
trying out from poopa sport addicted
makeup fix up sport addictive sport
proof it's a sport proof on the back so
oh that look like oh very fine mess I
wish all makeup setting spray is hard
dismissed I'm just gonna pop that down
the burn now for my highlighter today
I'm gonna be trying this collection
pretty air highlight off this is from
the same brand that I've been using
literally the whole time that's what it
looks like on the inside so it's watches
pretty good sugars i swatched it in
store I'm actually gonna spray the brush
with a bit of the fixing miss stuff this
set of spray that I just used before
oh yeah yeah we car need a more denser
brush because still haven't got my uh
Nastasia highlighting brush in the parts
yet and if a terrific car is missing
again I am just black away just loading
a fuckload of the highlighter up onto
this brush oh that's better
oh you sure this is good for
highlighting what is this morphe g37
fuck me
oh my god you guys this highlighter is
so good this is actually so lit this
highlighter oh and of course my little
cube here keep it by uh just before I go
on to my lips I'm just gonna take this
eyeshadow palette that I used earlier
and just take the brown you guys this
highlighter holy shit I'm just gonna pop
the brown shade just under my lower lash
line just to kind of even out the top on
the bottom a little bit and then I'm
gonna take some of that mascara that I
use fairly out the one that I did not
like that's actually really good for
bottom lashes well I'm starting to get
really bad at looking in the viewfinder
over time anyway moving on to lips I'm
gonna be taking the matte lip fluid from
that brand that I've been using this
whole fucking entire time and I can just
say it again and again this is in the
color but no bloody idea but it's the
closest color that they hadn't stopped
that I thought would suit me ah she is
pigmented okay so I'm loving this lip
color but when I looked down the mascara
or transferred underneath my fucking
eyes sorry I'm just gonna see if I can
just get ready and just get this a
scratch-off oh fucking hell
oh wow that is just not budging at all
I'm just gonna see if I can fix this to
make this look a little bit more photo
ready by just taking some of that map
highlighting shade and just going over
the top of that okay top is gonna have
to do and now last but not least I'm
just gonna set everything in place with
the makeup setting spray again
okay guys so this is the completed and
finished look my full face using Chinese
/ Hong Kong makeup I hope you guys
really enjoyed it I'm so impressed with
the highlighter and the foundation to be
honest and the lip product it's like not
drying or anything like that it's going
on really nicely it's like velvety other
thing that I oh god my eyes are a little
bit bloodshot that's probably the
mascara anyway I hope you guys really
