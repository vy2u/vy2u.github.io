channel so today I'm gonna be doing a
part two to full face using makeup
products that I hate so I did one of
these quite a long time ago and you guys
have been requesting it non-stop for the
past yeah also so it's taking me a while
to get these products or up I'm not just
gonna put a product in one of these
videos just to simply fill it in like if
I don't have this I'm just not just
gonna chuck it in just to make the video
like a definite full face there are a
few things I don't have actually I've
pretty much got everything besides
lashes and eyebrows stuff so I've
already done my brows just a quick a
little rough job because this makeup
tutorial or look at the end is not going
to look good whatsoever and of course
just a little disclaimer if you guys use
any other products and you like them
that I'm using today that's great I'm
glad they work for you they just don't
happen to work for me everyone's skin
types are different and makeup types are
different I guess sorry yeah without any
further ado let's get straight into it
alright guys so let's get started on my
eyes now I'm gonna be taking the Loreal
Pro Glo infallible concealer now I use
this a few videos ago and it burns your
eyes so I'm gonna be using this as a
base for my eyeshadow today dunno how
that's gonna go down but we're just
gonna give it a whirl the reason why I
do not like this concealer whatsoever is
because it literally like you'll just be
applying it and then you'll get this
strong scent into your eye and it will
literally burn and make your eye water
and after uploading my video last time a
lot of people commented saying Jaclyn
hill and like other youtubers had the
same problem and that they had the same
problem so once I've done with this it's
going straight in the bin huntin all
right so I've just concealed under my
brows now I'm gonna bring this onto my
eyelid area wow it's not burning yet so
far but when I do my under eyes I feel
like it's gonna just gonna go the gap
right so I'm just popping this over this
is terrifying I'm just gonna take my
damp Beauty Blender and literally it
just blended all the product off no
worries
that's extra great cool ok sick balls no
worries now to set that in place I'm
just gonna take the Tarte smooth
operator Amazonian clay finishing powder
I do not like the way this sets on my
skin taut you know I love you mm-hmm
this is one of the only products from
tarts range that I have never liked it
just doesn't work it flashes back and
it's just super super white it leaves a
white cast under your eyes and I feel
like it takes off the concealer but I'm
just gonna use this to set my eyeshadow
in place okay so my concealer in place
not that there's any concealer left but
that's not a problem now moving on to
your I show you guys thought I was gonna
whip out the desert dusk or the
subculture palette No
today I'm gonna be using the Natasha -
no Natalie love Helen le let me tell you
a little story about this baby so I was
doing a full face - first impressions
start off with my eyes first and I
literally stopped filming the video
because the eye shadow look was that
 up literally so it's to me like I
when I haven't touched that the other
colors for all I know they could be
pretty good like super pigmented yeah
whatever well the brown shades in here
which is when I started off with
literally did a subculture
on me and I was like see ya so I
literally stopped filming and filmed
another video because it just looked
that bad I know full face the first
impressions are all about that but it
just looked that up and I was
like not happening today though so I'm
gonna dig into this brown shade right
here now the price point there's a lot
of kick up as well not a problem the
price point for the Natasha - no no I
shadow palettes ah beyond me beyond me I
wouldn't spend that much money on a
shadow palette ever I am currently on a
Natasha Turner's P Alice don't know if
I'm going to be after this video but if
I really wanted products I'll buy them
myself
so yeah pretty much you just pop these
on and they just go chunky as and
there's lines everywhere they don't
blend out they blend out to some what
extent but just like dude if you're
paying like over $200 for a
eyeshadow palette make it worthwhile
dull you know what I mean sorry I guess
you can already see the patchiness of
this eyeshadow Wow I'm just gonna pop
that on there and then I'm gonna see if
I can blend it out so what I mean it
literally just sticks and like doesn't
blend that's where the whole patchiness
thing comes in like hun blend gonna try
and blend this out just with this fluffy
brush now I'm gonna take this deep
maroon shutter here and put that into my
out of V just a deepen up the look a
little bit now if you guys are following
along at home just sit tight because
this look is gonna be come on okay
alright now I haven't actually tried
these shimmery shades in this palette
for all I know they could be good but my
first impressions of this palette was
not cute at all so I'm gonna go in it
with this pebble shade right here I'm
just gonna take it on my finger wow
that's actually really nice cute so I'm
just gonna put this over my lid area
okay so moving on to my skin I'm gonna
be taking the Becca ever matte poreless
priming Perfector now if you have
extremely oily skin you would love this
however mine's like oily / dry and this
makes your skin feel uncomfortable
warmer so it is just sorry mattifying
it's not a nice feeling and just can
make it
feels like glue as you're putting it on
it definitely does mattify the skin but
it does not feel nice applying it and my
skin just feels gross after putting it
on I don't know I just really don't like
the feeling as you're putting it on so
I'm just like sticky and it feels like
there's something stuck all over your
face like a glue and like when you move
it's like oh okay so okay so moving on
to foundation I'm gonna be taking the
infallible total cover foundation from
L'Oreal now when I use this a couple of
times
patchy as hard to apply up
so it is full coverage but it is cakey
and it is sorry patchy and it's kind of
like a mousse like so I'm just gonna go
straight up on in here I'm just gonna be
popping this all over my skin my skin
feels rank after putting that primer on
it just feels so gross and some parts
found out this foundation just
especially my nose like I'll wipe my
skin down with a makeup wipe before I
even started it just doesn't stick to it
and it just looks like you can kind of
see the skin underneath it like it's not
attaching to skin properly pretty much
almost turns into a powder like as you
can see can you see there that's Fox
like what do you mean just put more on
and take it up oh yeah it definitely
does have full coverage but it does not
feel nice on the skin it does not build
up well it just does not stick just
certain parts of my face do you guys
feel like it has has any of you guys try
this foundation before can you let me
know
if I'm doing something wrong alright
once my foundation is laid down I'm
gonna go in with the L'Oreal concealer
to highlight I guess here we go oh my
god
oh it like goes into your eye and like
stings I'm saying that as I put more on
like no worries oh my eyes like
twitching wow that was an experience I'm
just gonna blend this concealer uh-huh
if there's meant to be a turtle cover
concealer - meaning full coverage I'm
like right off the end of my nose no
worry one-stop concealers blend it out
I'm then gonna grit back into my
thoughts Pat off
Oh God and I'm just gonna bake my
undereyes it like settles into your
pores almost it settles into your pores
I don't like it I don't like it I'm just
gonna run this over the rest of my face
I'm just be just because I don't
have a foundation powder to use for this
video so I'm just gonna set the rest of
my face with it and it's literally like
what is it doing under here what is
going on it like takes off all the
concealer okay you guys need to see this
 up close what is going on in this
region here like what is happening
what's that about
anyway guys continuing on I'm just gonna
take the natasha genera palette once
again straight up bone gonna pop that
straight under my eye and then I'm just
gonna blend it out with some more light
brown I doesn't actually look that bad
to be honest like the perfect example if
you go watch Chinese video where should
use this in the first impressions
literally it's subculture as far patchy
or any sticks or some parts of your eye
it's kind of X want to do a purple
eyeshadow look that I'm kind of digging
a way I'm just gonna dust off all this
excess powder I don't know if you guys
can tell but like where I've wiped it
all off it's like all patchy just taking
the concealer off here whether that's
the concealer or powder I don't know I'm
pretty sure it's the powder because I've
used a concealer without using the
powder and it was fine and it's
literally like it created like this cast
of powder right here I forgot to
use this contour stick okay so guys this
is the Fenty Beauty contour stick I used
it the other day when I was doing my
century of you I don't know if you guys
have seen it I'm just a few videos back
on my channel so you obviously men
should go underneath your skin with no
powder on which is what I did and it
literally blend it into nothing so I
would include doing it if I hadn't
forgotten to powder my whole face but
like how are you meant to apply
this like I applied it like directly to
my skin I'm just gonna give you guys an
example even though I have powder that's
probably gonna look even more
than it normally is but like with
contour sticks I apply the product and
then blend it out and like if you watch
my fan tea review it didn't even blend
out like it did but it blended into
nothing and there
nothing left on my skin so I didn't
really understand what was going on
there whether you're meant to blend it
out with a brush some people were
commenting but lack I mean if you blend
it out with a brush it's just going to
be exactly the same thing it's such a
thick consistency and I feel like it's
so dry and it's not wet enough to be a
contour stick if that makes sense I
don't know this is definitely included
in my video just if I didn't forget to
use it okay moving on to bronzer this is
from Milani this is a baked bronzer
literally this is makes you look like
you've got glitter all over your face so
I doesn't take a little bit of that just
go straight up phone in here it's
literally just so glowy and patchy and
orange
I love Milani there's so many things
from Milani that I love but like this is
like a letdown not to mention the color
of it is extremely orange anyway that's
gonna keep bronzing up my whole face
like I normally would wow that looks
amazing hell okay now for my
blush today I'm gonna be taking this
Bobbi Brown cheek and lip tint now I'm
not just singling out Bobbi brasses I'm
singling out every brand because I don't
get liquid blushes and cream blushes
like I just don't understand it I never
have so literally what you meant to do
is just dab it onto your cheek and blend
it out currently it's meant to make it
last longer
haaaah cuz I will not be leaving this on
for long but cream blushes just don't
make sense to me like what do you mean
like why use a cream if the pad is gonna
look so much more blended I guess if you
want that natural sort of look that's
gonna work but like you have to apply
this out of the powder you can't just
like put it underneath your foundation
or whatever cuz it's just gonna cover it
up you know what I mean okay now that I
look incredible I'm ready to go
out so her Sunday's I'm coming for you
for my mascara today I'm gonna be taking
this from Marc Jacobs honestly like why
is this even a thing sir I'm pretty sure
it's for your bottom lashes but it
honestly doesn't do for me like it
literally even on your top lashes like
is this even a mascara is it oh my god
yeah that's just mascara on it
literally nothing comes off on the brush
it's literally just like that tiny
a little bit of mascara coming out I
mean I guess when you compare this to
the MAC extended play gigablack lash
this is horrible four bottom
lashes I think it is meant for bottom
lashes but nothing comes out
anyway okie dokie guys moving on to
highlighted this one here is from
L'Oreal True Match highlight powder glar
I'm just gonna take some of this on my
brush quite a generous amount the reason
why I don't like this is because it
literally blends into nothing and it's
so powdery on this side it's lightly
going over another reason why I don't
like this is because it also brings out
your pores in your skin and it reminds
me of powdery chalk now for my lip
product today this is from the balm the
reason why I don't like this is the
smell the color is beautiful
the smell is like an off like minty
chocolate it's just way too strong as
soon as you open it it goes straight to
your nose and he it honestly smells like
a minty Christmas present you know like
at Christmastime and you got like jaws
of mints or something from like your
grandma your grandfather and they're
really strong personally if you
know me I hate mints like mint teas
because when I was younger and me and my
family and my sister and all that would
go out like Mount Hotham in that and
like big mountains to get to specific
places I would get sick in the car and
my sister would always eat mint teas and
I'd kill her for it because it
just reminds me of vomiting going up a
mountain like I used to get really
carsick and as since then I've never
ever since then I've never ever liked
mints and this smell just reminds me of
vomiting in the backseat of the car into
the laundry bucket and chucking it out
the side of the car when we had to pull
her up now last but not least for
setting spray I'm gonna be taking the
cover effects illuminating setting spray
now I bought this myself so this was a
mistake that I made
I did not realize if you guys
remember I use this in a tutorial for
the first time I close my eyes and just
spray a ton of I open my eyes and I
was like holy now this is meant to
be a makeup setting spray but it is
illuminating so you have to use it
sparingly but knowing me I like to go
absolutely hand with my setting
sprays and this is just not for me it
might be good for some people who like
that little bit of glow but to set my
face I use a
turn and this thing yeah so I'm just
gonna show you guys what it does in case
you do wanna buy it or if you do like a
illuminating sort of look to your face
okay so pretty much the setting spray
has dried and it just makes your skin
look really illuminated and glowy I
remember the first time I used it it was
intense as if you've been following
me for a while you'll probably remember
that tutorial that I didn't I used it in
it I was just like and see ya
anyway I really hope you guys somewhat
enjoyed this video if you did make sure
you give it a massive thumbs up for me
leave me any video requests below that
you guys want me to do I love you guys
so much have an awesome day night
wherever in the world you are and I'll
see you all in my next video bye
see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
