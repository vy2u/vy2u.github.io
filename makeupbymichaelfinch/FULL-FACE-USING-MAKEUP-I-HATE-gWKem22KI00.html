today I'm going to be doing the full
face of makeup using only makeup
products that I hate now this video has
been highly requested hence why I'm
doing it it took me a while to get all
the together that I don't like but
this is stuff that I generally don't
like I would never use again or this is
stuff no some of the stuff in here is
stuff that I actually genuinely do hate
and just a little quick display mark
these work for you guys I'm jealous
I'm happy I'm glad that they work for
you guys but they just don't work for me
so if you love these products that I'm
using then I'm sorry I don't want to
offend you I just have to say that just
because it's YouTube so first of all I'm
going to be starting off with my
eyebrows now this is the LA Colors
eyebrow eyeshadow kit thing oh and
honestly it's just not even good it's
never worked for me it never has it's
too gray it's just true I just really I
just don't like it I just don't like it
okay and normally I'm really picky with
stuff that I use on my eyebrows Laurie
when I have to use this today oh yeah
not to mention it is not even frickin
pigmented like wow that looks amazing
awesome this honestly isn't even doing
anything nothing at all it's just adding
the tiny is gonna cut into my eyebrows
well isn't this just awesome
okay now that my eyebrows are done let's
move on to their concealer that I do not
like Chicago out my brows because
they're so on fleek ATM this can feel
out is the Rimmel stay matte concealer
in the shade ivory and just by looking
at it
yuck this has no coverage it doesn't do
anything good it's drying
I just really hate it so I'm
just going to carve out my eyebrows with
this this honestly looks like a
mess already
bye of course it kind of works the timer
I don't want it to work let's see how it
goes under my eyes though hmm moving on
to the next product that I do know like
this is the NYX eyeshadow base this is
just so thick you can really use this
much otherwise the creases it just
doesn't work it just does not
work for me okay get my wife father
people but it doesn't work for me so
it's like a fully white base it's very
sticky it's very like yup dunno I was
doing a clown tutorial just going to be
putting that all over and it just feels
gross as well like it feels like it's
one of those things that's never going
to set them up like how much powder you
use I'm just going to take my Beauty
Blender and attempt to blend that out
now to set that I'm just going to take
some translucent powder and I'm going to
show you later on
what translucent powder I am using that
is another reason why I hate it anyway
for my eyeshadow today I'm going to be
using the timeless palette by chichi now
these palettes got hyped up so much and
I was so excited to get one and I used
it in my last video and I was so
disappointed they didn't blend properly
they didn't um you know how like if
you're a makeup artist like when you get
 I shadow as you know that they're
 because like they don't blend they
just go patchy like real patchy and yuck
this is the palette for you I don't know
if it's all Gigi's palettes like this
but this one is just real I was so
disappointed so I'm going to take some
of that brown shade and just run that
through the upper crease area I swear to
God if any of this works today I'm
going to I'm gonna be so angry but as
you can see that concealer has already
like broken apart and it just looks
crushed like see already it's just so
I'm just trying to blend out like if
this is a normal eye shadow it would
blend it up but now it's gotten patchy
in this part here it's more pigmented up
here than it is down here just like what
oh wow that looks amazing and look now
that I'm trying to pack the product in
it's just not adding any more we've got
a great big striking line that was not
caused by the brush you know cuz I was
doing blending motions see what I mean
it's just now he's gonna take the
warm brown shade out of the palette
again and just put that all on the
eyelid but this is just me up
completely like what even I was just
blending it as I normally was
normal eyes shadow and that happens but
so this is what the eye shadow looks
like up close
can you see what I'm talking about here
and look at the concealer and the eye
bases honestly affected the eye shadow
too but it just doesn't look good at all
let's move on to the rest of the face
now for primer you guys you guys so this
is the most horrible thing to use as a
primer for your face now this is the
Nivea men / shape I'm insensitive now if
you don't know I've actually made a
fully dedicated video as to why this is
not a good primer for your skin in no
way is it trying to diss nikkietutorials
discovery of this product I love Nikki
she is awesome um but it might work for
some people and it might not work for
some it definitely didn't work for me so
I'll leave the video link down below as
to why I don't like this as a primer I
know a lot of people do if it works for
you I'm jealous because I wish I work
for make it the slope bucket sheet and a
good makeup product that's cheap and
works is the turn-on
okay so mmm so I'm just I haven't this
is gonna be so fast because I haven't
put this on my face and so long Oh yuck
moving on to your foundation this is the
Elizabeth Arden New York flawless finish
perfect starting 24-hour foundation this
 oxidizes to the point where it's
just a joke
I do not like this it's very hard to
blend out it's very thick and guys I
just don't like it at all
clearly not my color either and just the
undertone of all the foundations that
they have there's not much variety it's
all like pinky sort of undertone and not
cute a lot of people sit on my youtube
channel in my comments and just say oh
my god you win just about every single
makeup product like he wins about
everything it is my job to judge makeup
on the daily so I don't understand why
people complain about me doing that like
you can already see this is changing
color right now like from when I put it
on it's gone more orangey already see
this was the original color see see the
color and now it's gone that dark
already its oxidizing already can you
imagine what its gonna be like in like
an hour
yuck moving back home Jim
under-eye concealer I'm just gonna take
that Rimmel one that I was using before
this is not a comfortable like tag
challenge to do because once you've had
a make a point that you don't like you
in the other way or you're not gonna use
her again
nope not me now it's gonna take my
Beauty Blender and like mmm
just already where I've just put that
see it's already dried and stuck there I
don't know if that looks blended on
camera but in person it just looks
patchy and dry I'm gonna have to like
drag this as I go otherwise it's not
gonna move at all what a test this
is what a this I'm also
just going to put a little bit on my
chin Cupid's bow my nose and my forehead
I hate dry concealers and this is
definitely one of the driest ones I've
ever used yeah now I might get a lot of
people rate me for this but that's okay
that's okay my opinion if it works for
you that's awesome the next product I
want to talk about is this fine in one
product from benefit it's just basically
a sheer brightening color the cheeks and
lips I've just never understood cream
blushes unless you're doing a really
natural which isn't me they just don't
work for me
um I always like to powder my face and I
feel like you need to put this on before
and then the powder covers it anyway but
I haven't had it my face yet so I'm just
going to put a bit of this on when I
went the wrong way it's which go that
way I'm gonna take the balm of my Beauty
Blender
and just blend that up okay like where
did that go can you see it mmm like
where he meant to put more this I'm
like how much she meant to put on to get
it to work and I feel like it just ruins
all your foundation underneath as well
you see what I'm talking about you see
what I'm talking about so moving on to
powder to set my under eyes and my whole
face this is the ahh I come with my
wasted my money on this this is the
Makeup Forever HD High Definition powder
this has the worst flashback in the
world who the makes the powder that
actually has flash back I don't
understand like what do people use a for
a photo shoot no because it will flash
back weddings no because it would flash
back I just don't understand why someone
would make a powder with flash back in
and now flash makers we're like you take
the photo with the flash or without the
flash and you get the massive white car
even if you wipe all the powder properly
it's still going to be there
yuck so I've literally only is this once
and that once and I used it was the once
and the last time that I used it except
for today and if you get this up your
nose go get an ascot puff up because
yuck
it's so finely milled so I'm just baking
my Andre I don't even care if I waste
this like I don't care just baking my
undereyes as I normally do and now I'm
just going to set the rest of my face
with that same powder now to bronze my
face this is the Sun globe by govt this
bronzer Hun's
if you ordered a red bronzer this is
what you're going to get this bronzer is
disgustingly red no shade kind of shade
and just start positing up my face don't
sit there for a minute and tell me that
is not red pink sunset orange that
literally looks like a sunset over the
beach like what the actual this is not a
Sun it's like in the shape of the Sun
it's got Suns all over the front of it
smell like sunburn this looks nothing
like some kiss oh by the way guys I just
put a little bit of eyeshadow underneath
my eyes as well this literally feels and
books rank like I'm not loving this at
all whore
moving on to contouring this is the icy
on to a kid from Australia this is the
most muddiest piece of I have ever
used like if you want a body contour you
have to contour today we're going to be
using the NARS
eita brush and I'm just gonna take some
oh I'm just going to start contouring my
cheeks this is like I'm using like the
warming sort of time you see what I mean
I'm using the tiniest bit of product and
I'm just creating myself a nice little
jawline here I'm just blending that down
so it looks completely natural now it's
going to be running that down the side
of my nose just to give it a nice slim
look like I just on the liquid lipstick
challenge all over again
moving on to mascara this is the bushwa
Volume one secondi mascara this mascara
transfers really really bad for me when
I grow on my bottom lashes and my top
lashes I guess it stays wet for quite a
while
my opinion it just doesn't work for me
I've only ever used it once and this is
the second time I'm using up
okay now the moments cars on let's do
some highlighter now this is not backing
up the brand because I generally love
Becca but cream highlighters have just
never ever made sense to me do they go
on under your foundation they get
covered up like when you set your
foundation I don't really know I'm not
really that into side of cream things
meaning highlighters blushes bronzers
I've never understood them and I never
will
um but basically I see a lot of people
after their foundation they just tap
over the cheekbone okay yeah that's
right call an ambulance
does that look appealing to you honestly
guys I don't know if I'm doing this
wrong but am i maybe mental blend blend
it out with my Beauty Blender because
why does it work to everyone else oh not
me I just moving on to lipstick this is
the NYX lingerie liquid lipstick when
this first came out I was very skeptical
and I did try it and it was okay but I
tried it again and again and it just got
worse and worse as time went on
basically this clumps up so that it
dries your lips out horribly you get
what you pay for you get what you pay
for so I'm just going to put this on and
it's not pigmented at all like I'm have
to I have to layer this up to get
pigment on there for some donor now last
but not least this is the L'Oreal fixing
miss this is the L'Oreal infallible
fixing mist by L'Oreal this is honestly
the shittiest setting spray I
have ever used and I'm ashamed
but I spent my money on this
basically all this powder sits at the
bottom you're meant to shake it up in
the bottle which is what I always do so
after giving it a shake you mentor them
spray it on your face okay now you guys
know I love to use a lot of setting
spray actually 400 on its gonna wipe off
my BAE back to my L'Oreal setting spray
I'm just gonna why isn't it even look at
all the white stuff at the top that's
like this stuff that sits on your face
yuck
okay Oh gonna let this drive with the
ban on can you guys see all the white
dots starting to form on my cheek I'm
gonna say Museum oh this is what big
 does oh look at my forehead though
put the white dogs on there oh my god it
just keeps getting worse and worse you
started I look in the mirror
vork guys oh so here's the close-up of
what the setting spray does it's really
not worth how much I paid for it I've
got what the price lens I was on but I
think it's worth around like $30 don't
ever bother all the discs Stunna that's
just come out beautiful my lips my
forehead is absolutely covered in white
dots so this pigs a right here
straight in the bin so this is the
finished look I hope you guys somewhat
enjoyed this video I definitely did have
fun making it because I want to show you
guys the products that I didn't like but
at the same time I was like very
skeptical because yuck my face feels
gross it also looks gross and I'm loving
all these little shots all over my
face right now huh so if you guys did
enjoy this video please don't forget to
give it a massive thumbs up it will help
me out a lot I love you guys so much and
I'll see you all in my next video bye
slow oh oh that didn't what oh oh oh oh
come on what hello never good Oh
