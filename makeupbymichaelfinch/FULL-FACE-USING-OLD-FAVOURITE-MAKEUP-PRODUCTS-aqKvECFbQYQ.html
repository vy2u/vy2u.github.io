if you are new than welcome to my
channel today I am going to be doing a
video I was tagged by shun X or like
back at the start of the year so Shannon
pretty much created this tag where you
have to do a full face using your old
makeup favorites now some of the things
that I was obsessed with I'm not I
wasn't able to find or I wasn't able to
purchase in time to this video or I just
literally cannot find them but you know
how you go through makeup when you chuck
 out you find new stuff all that
sort of jazz so I will leave Shannon's
link to her video down below if you want
to go and check that out as well and I'm
so excited because there is a few things
in here that I have not used in such a
long time but there are still some
things in this box that I use to this
day so let's get started okay so the
first thing I'm going to use is the UH
nastasi of beverly hills dipbrow pomade
in the shade blonde now I go way back
with this when I first started makeup I
always dreamt of having an honest a seer
product and this was my first one and it
was so exciting because when I first
started makeup I could only you know
purchase I could only afford like
Maybelline and stuff like that and then
I really started getting into it and
then I got a job like working in a cafe
and stuff with this brush it's so
old yak now I can actually go out and
buy my own Anastasio products and I
think that's something that I should be
really proud of and I'm sure you guys
have done that too and I'm sure you
should be really proud of yourself as
well now let's not get too cheesy before
this video starts but okay so I'm just
going to take this pomade this is so
weird using because I've not used it in
such a long time so I'm just creating
some shape with this stuff and it's so
weird using this to be honest I probably
have used that the past few years what I
just don't remember like I haven't
really reached for this I've reached for
other things because you know how new
makeup always comes out and people want
to know what you'd like what your
thoughts are on it and stuff like that
so I haven't used it and so yes I'm
loving this brow mMmmm oh so now that my
brows are all done let's move on to
concealer God look until I used to
use any go through my drawers now you
know what's on my old videos alright
I've got it okay now that my browser are
done I'm going to move on to concealer
and today I'm going to be using the Born
This Way concealer does anybody remember
this I'm pretty sure this was out before
the other decay conceal look if I know I
went through a stage of dis conceal
ah the Urban Decay one and now I'm like
literally stuck with touch okay and I
know I need to stop using that in every
video because it's very hard for some
people to get because it's only an
exclusive to Ulta but you can actually
get on the website and I've mentioned
that in a lot of videos before but I
have not used this in a long
time and I'm so excited this is in the
shade fair okay I don't know why I said
I was excited because I stopped using it
for a reason obviously something better
came out but this is still a pretty good
concealer okay so I'm just gonna paint
this all under my brow and kind of drag
it down to my lid it is there's actually
a pretty good like coverage concealer I
forgot how good this was oh my god I
forgot to wet my Beauty Blender why me
everytime bendy why I'm actually going
to get off my set off some wetness for a
change so BRB alright I'm back with a
wet as Beauty Blender but I'm just
going to pack more of this concealer all
over my eyelid area and then I'm just
going to take my wet with water Beauty
Blender and go to town now to set my
lids in place I'm going to be taking the
mehron celebre Pro loose mineral
finishing powder now a lot of people may
not know about mehron because it's not
like an actual Beauty thing it's more
like special effects and stuff but they
do do like different foundations and
like stuff like that if you know if
you've ever heard of mayor on before
leave a comment below because I'm really
curious because I don't really see many
youtubers talk about it but anyway I'm
just going to get my boobie blender into
that and then I'm just going to set my
lid so it doesn't crease okay moving on
to my eyeshadow I'm going to be taking
the many mu a makeup geek collaboration
this is literally destroyed it doesn't
really look like that actually does it
just really messy this colors up
in the Corning because I've used it so
much but I'm when this first came out
this was my go-to non-stop like this was
my huda beauty back in the bottle oh
sorry good so I'm going to
create a look with this I'm really
excited because I haven't used this
green sort of color in such a long time
so I'm just going to take the middle
shade first and I'm going to be using
this as like my transition thing you
know what I'm saying and I'm just now
makeup geek shadows are bomb they are
that good and
I have not used makeup geek shadows in
so long
ask me why I don't know I feel like you
know being a youtuber people don't want
to go out and buy single eyeshadows I
just want to get a pallet and stuff so
it's just easier for my viewers to you
know follow along with but if you guys
want to see me use like more makeup geek
shows I've literally got every single
one of them I can um start incorporating
some makeup geek if you guys are
interested so let me know let me know in
the comments below fam like look how
beautiful this transition is like I'm
done so I'm just generously building up
that transition so I've got a nice
amount to put all my other shades down
whereas yes I just find it so funny how
we have these like amazing products you
know one year and then the next week
never use them again so like I kind of
like this tag because you know bringing
me back it's bringing me back to when I
first started with makeup yeah not that
this palette has hasn't been around you
know another dispell it's been around
for so long but this was just my go-to
non-stop this is when I think this came
out when I really started getting into
YouTube look I don't really remember the
exact day but I know a long time ago I
used to use the Anastasia Beverly Hills
lavish palette and I cannot find it
anywhere if so I would've been using it
in today's video because it's just not
good but to our shadows go off because
they're probably way off now
now the next shade I'm going to be
dipping into is this brown shade here
and I'm going to start building this up
through my crease over the transition
color
now this shade isn't much darker from
the transition so you don't need too
much of that now I'm going to be taking
this burgundy like reddish maroon color
yes oh my god this is bringing me way
back just this color combination by and
I'm going to generously start building
this right up through my crease but I'm
going to take a bit more of that shade
that I had before and I'm just going to
blend over the edges of this blend out
as we go now I'm going to take some of
that a really dark color it's like the
darkest one in the palette and I'm going
to start blending this into my outer V
and that burgundy color just bringing it
up through my crease because I have
those
 hooded eyes you know that I was
going to take some more of that burgundy
shade and blend out those edges this
eyeshadow palette is literally just
about going back in and packing on color
now I'm just going to add some more
black in all this burgundy color I'm
just going to spritz my brush with a bit
of thick slice and then I'm going to dip
into that green eyeshadow oh my god yes
the quality of the shadows has not
changed at all
and then I'm just going to take my brush
and kind of put some more of that black
shade just on the outer V and just to
blend those green eyeshadow edges out I
guess
okay guys I'm just going to go in to
decide to save time and then I'll come
back and we'll get started on the face
okay guys now that my eyes are done
let's move on to mascara now the mascara
that I used to use I do not have it was
the benefit they're real mascara
I swore by that mascara and I still kind
of do like I'm sure if I use it now I'd
be like oh my god I've fallen back in
love with it because I just fell back in
love with this many M you a makeup geek
palette but today because I don't have
that they're real I'm just going to be
using the Too Faced and better than
their cool yes so I'm just gonna oh my
god why do I always shut myself in the
 eye I'm such an amateur when it
comes from the scars sometimes now
because I didn't have a specific lash
that I use because I didn't really know
how to put lashes on when I first
started makeup I'm just gonna be using
these lashes here from lash warriors I'm
just going to stick these on and we'll
get started on my face okay guys now
that my lashes are all stuck on let's
get started on primer and this has been
my go-to primer for such a long time
this is pretty much the first primer I'm
pretty sure I ever got my hands on and
y'all know is that I still use it to
this day so I have not stopped this is
one product that I have literally not
stopped using ever
it's just that good this and the
foundation that I'm about to use next
was my combo go-to favorite we just love
when you get poor professional
in your hair by okay now moving on to
foundation I'm going to be taking the
perfecting a liquid foundation from our
blonde now for those who don't know our
bond is like one of those is kind of
like Avon it's like the pyramid effect
like you sign up as a consultant or you
just bash it up other people that are
already a consultant I used to be a
consultant for it and
my opinion is literally a cult I
actually to be a consultant for this and
yeah I'm not making more bed um yeah I
used to swear by this foundation I got
all my friends onto it but then you
should just came out and I totally
forgot about it you know that's always
how it is so this foundation is in the
shade buff and what I'm gonna do is I'm
just going to start putting it on I'm
going to direct with the beauty blender
sticks well but not oh my god the smell
has not changed obviously yeah or if
it's as good as I remember it to be like
after using like all these new
foundations that have come out lately
and like just like different ones let's
see let's see how it goes yep
it's exactly the same this is so weird
so I'm just going to keep building up
this foundation this is the foundation
that I used to use on my clients when I
used to do clients but on the BOK butter
so good no flashback perfect for brides
weddings anything like that I love it
I'm just going to conceal the tops of my
brows with this foundation okay now to
just blend out this forehead big ol
 landing strip look at the
coverage starter it's literally the same
as it was like two years ago once I'm
happy with how my foundations looking
I'm just going to take the Born This Way
concealer again and highlight and
conceal my t-zone now taking that same
concealer and I'm going to do my under
eyes we've all ending up so well I'm
just I miss this concealer I feel like
this concealer is so moisturizing as
well yes you bake my under eyes I'm just
going to take this the celebri pro
powder from a run that I used before I'm
just going to bake all underneath my
eyes and my nose like I always do now
I'm moving on to powder foundation to
set the rest of my face I'm going to
taking the hello flawless foundation
powder by benefit I think when I first
started doing YouTube and stuff benefit
was one of my first like PR people so
they sent me like PR so I'm just going
to set the rest of my foundation with
this this is in the shade honey it might
be a bit dark but I'm gonna make it work
now to contour today I'm going to be
taking the benefit benefit benefit hoola
bronzer this is a matte face powder and
I have you
since Daejeon pretty much most of the
stuff is benefit just because as I said
earlier they were one of my serves like
PR people whoever sent me like a PR
package so I was like really excited and
stuff so I'm just going to start
contouring with hoorah I don't know if
you guys know but benefits just come out
with a new hauler and it's all alight so
it's for paler people like me so it
doesn't look muddy or anything like that
and I'm finding this a little bit hard
to work with because I'm just so used to
haul the light now I think I've put too
much on so I'm just going to do a little
bit of contouring with this today just
going to run a little bit of what's left
on the brushes down the side of my nose
just to bring it back a little bit
because it got was a little bit lost in
all that concealer and foundation now
the bronzer that I used to always go to
was the market give me Sun and it is
quite orange so I'm a little concerned
of what it's going to do to my face
right now but this is what I used to use
I went through like two of these I think
this is my second one I haven't used in
a hot minute because I don't really take
10 anymore and it's the perfect bronzer
for when your fake tan
so yeah wish me luck a little nervous
this is so orange so just a little bit
tap it off and then I'm just gonna start
bronzing oh my god it's so orange oh oh
my god it's right we can make it work
make it work make it work just I'm just
going to do the tiniest little bit
tiniest little bit and just blend my
life away actually doesn't look so bad
when you just use a tiny bit but if I
was to pack this out of it on like
I did when I was tan like Butler
oh ha ha ha I'll be looking like an uber
Loompa honey I'll be looking that
crystal wax it done so doesn't know
bringing back a bit of warmth okay that
wasn't as bad as I thought just adding a
tiny bit of give me son I think it
because I just used to go absolutely ham
on the bronzer so scared that I was
going to do that today but I didn't I
restrained myself thank you okay let's
get these under eyes all finished off so
I'm just going to take those two
transitionary Brown shades that I used
at the beginning but I was going to take
a little blending brush and just blend
that down then I'm going to dip into
that more brownie shade and straight
underneath my lash line
and now I'm going to get that extra dark
ammonia sort of color and just go right
up against my lashline just from light
to dark
you know oh my god that's so pretty I'm
just going to do this eye and I'll do
our back okay now that my under eyes
Adams gonna dust off that bake that
we've had sitting there got it bakes
well it doesn't like remove any
concealer or change the color or
anything now for my bottom lashes I'm
just going to pop a little bit of the
Too Faced better than sex mascara now
moving on to blush this is makeup geeks
heartthrob ACS use a combination of
heartthrob and main squeeze these two
here will make go two's back in the day
so I'm just going to mix these two
together dudes are such good blushes oh
 it's so pigmented well that's right
and that's fan okay before we move on to
highlight I'm just going to spritz my
face a little bit of the six-plus now I
literally cannot remember if I use mary
lou manizer or champagne pop first but
I'm 99% sure I was using dis first
because I know this was my first
high-end highlighter so I'm pretty sure
with this so today we're going to use
the mary lou from the balm this is
classified as like not high-end in
Australia I don't know about anywhere
else because it is sold in Target so
it's classified as like the drugstore
makeup now I know they used to sell it
at David Jones back in the buckler but
they don't anymore
it's like fully just in target so I know
if that's a good thing or a bad thing to
the brand but either way they still make
really good products survive oh my god
this is good I totally forgot just gonna
pop this on oh my god it blends so well
what the I totally forgot about
this that's stunning
I'm just gonna bring it up above my brow
a little bit although apparently that
trend needs to stop eat my ass I'm going
to put highlighter on my about
my brows the rest of my life oh my god
yes what the hell this has been such a
fun video to film and I really hope you
guys have enjoyed it as well cuz this is
just fun like reminiscing it's like
going back in time home back to the
future hun okay now let's not go
overboard with the highlighter because
you guys know when I can be like
sometimes I look like a sweaty mess I'm
just going to do my Cupid's bow um by
the way guys if you are looking for a
highlighter
that is good and drugs started here in
Australia to bar mary-lou manizer like I
remember when this was the on
YouTube back in the day this was what
everyone was using on YouTube
it was the and it's still such a
good product but as I said earlier new
stuff comes out and people change their
views on stuff I'm also just going to
put a little bit of my inner corners too
because they're looking a little bit
dull up in there now last but not least
for my lip color today I'm going to be
using stoned by dose of colors and I'm
pretty sure I've bought like starting
this is I've been through like 20 of
these over the past few years but I'm
pretty sure I bought stoned when I was
applying maps for the first time which
was a long time ago like first my other
one time asked because that was years
ago
and I just fell in love with it and it
was just my go-to every single day and
so making me really like it's making me
really feel weird like this looks like
this is good makeup like I'm so
impressed with all these products like
it's really bringing me back to when I
first started making me all emotional
and this smells sort of good too
dose of colors have the best formula
liquid lipsticks but dose of colors has
changed this color like three times over
the past few years it used to be like a
lot more paler and a lot more nude now
it's more dark still pretty though oh my
god guys we're done and if the settings
Brad didn't actually use setting sprays
back in the day so I'm not going to use
on today this is the completed look I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
I had so much fun filming it this was
the best and most fun makeup tutorial
I've done in a while like I really liked
truly enjoyed filming this otherwise
just what we back I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did please
don't forget to give me a massive thumbs
up and if you are a youtuber I tag
