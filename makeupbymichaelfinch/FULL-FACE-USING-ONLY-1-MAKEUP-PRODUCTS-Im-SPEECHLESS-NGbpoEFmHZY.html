channel so today I'm going to be doing
another full face challenge and this
time I'm going to be doing full face
using only makeup products that cost
$1.00 now I'm gonna leave the website
down below where I got everything from
and I'm a little nervous but let's not
judge it let's just try it out and see
how we go I've got literally everything
from primer from brows to eyeshadow to
lashes something that I don't have is
setting spray that's the only thing I
don't have because I didn't have it on
their website everything else I've got
so without any further ado let's get
straight into it
now to make this even more affordable
I'm gonna be using really affordable
brushes as well so I've got a bunch from
elf and BH Cosmetics and ones that you
can get in like Priceline and like on
the cheaper end of the makeup brushes
first of all I'm gonna be going on with
this eyebrow kit this is by a brand
called amuse Cosmetics and I'm just
gonna be taking the lightest shade and
then I'm just gonna take the darkest
shade and I'm just gonna pop that at the
end in my brow and I'm just gonna be
filling in my brow this Brown is a
little bit orange but we're just gonna
roll with it and make it work
okay so now I'm just going to brush
these brows upwards now what if you
always comment about my eyes being so
red and like watery and like bloodshot
that's because when I do like three
videos in a row two videos in a row my
eyes get irritated after rubbing off my
makeup once and then for the rest of the
day they're so sensitive and if like air
like cold air goes in them they get like
extra water and I've got an air con here
so don't sweat like a bush pig that's
why my eyes go red so now it's time to
conceal these brows so I'm gonna be
taking this concealer from a or a studio
it's the one to cover HD concealer in
the shade porcelain so I'm going to
spots on my hand for us well that looks
super full coverage okay let's give it a
whirl all right so I'm just gonna pop it
straight under my brow oh then I'm just
going to take a little brush and conceal
the brow okay now I'm just gonna take
that concealed out old down on my
yeah the coverage is like holy shit like
relax now I ordered a little
Beautyblender on this website and this
is what I got I guess this is what I'm
gonna be using to blend out my I can
still ahh oh gosh that's not blending
well at all I'm just gonna take this
brush and blend it out with that instead
I think it's because the beauty blenders
really new maybe and it just doesn't
want to do anything it's supposed to all
right I'm just gonna take this powder
here this is from a brand called Santi
it's the matte powder this concealer so
sticky oh my gosh I'm just gonna do
exactly the same on this eye and then
I'll come back and we'll start on a
shadow so as far as eyeshadow goes I've
got this palette right here now as far
as the price goes I'm pretty sure I was
nine or ten dollars so they work out to
be about dollar H including the magnetic
palette and then I've also got this
little palette here from Santi the brand
it's like warm tones and brown and
whatnot so I know I do this look all the
time but I've got no other option I'm
just gonna take this brown color here
and I'm gonna start off by popping that
into my crease and I'm gonna blend this
all through I don't want to say I love
it just yet third because I want to say
how they the colors pop onto each other
by the way majority of eye brushes I'm
using from morphe the more affordable
ones will be like face brushes and
whatnot
there's gonna add some more and bring it
through so the next trade I'm gonna go
in with is this brown warm brown color
and yeah I'm just gonna say right now
the pigmentation of this one and the
blend ability has got me chef so I'm
hoping this one is the same kind of oh
wow I'm actually a little bit shook
myself I'm just gonna pack in a little
bit more of the warm brown I'm just
going to be doing exactly the same on
this eye and bringing it all the way
into my inner corner okay so taking this
eyeshadow palette here this is the
Santee professional eye shadow I'm just
gonna take the black shade from pop here
tap off my brush and then go straight on
any young I was hoping this would be
really nice and pigmented but it's
literally like chalk what I'm gonna do
is I'm just gonna try and bring that
onto the inner part of my eye and just
like a cross yeah I'm gonna kind of do
like a halo just going back in with the
dark warm brown color I'm just going to
blend out that black a little bit and
just go along the edges but the formula
of it is shit but it's not that bad
considering it was a dollar for the
whole eyeshadow palette I'm just gonna
take it the black on this little flat
brush here and I'm gonna pack it onto my
in a corner and also onto the outer V
this doesn't look too bad it just
requires a lot of blending and packing
on color and my arm isn't very much pain
what I'm gonna do now is I'm just gonna
take this flat top brush and this shade
here I think order just gonna take a bit
of that and oh my god considering I
didn't put
like fixed applause or not okay now that
I've got that on there I'm just gonna
take just brush using before with the
warm brown on it and kind of just gently
blend around the edges make it look a
little bit more blended well I forgot I
had this this is the eyeshadow pearl
powder it kind of looks like a pigment
or something like that I'm gonna open
this up okay I'm just gonna dip into
this oh yeah that's better color I'm
gonna spray my brush with a little bit
of fix+
so I'm just gonna use that shadow that I
used before there's like a base for that
pigment that I'm gonna put over the top
I also have this brow go fiber gel brow
shit
it looks gray but we're gonna give it a
whirl
doesn't look gray when you put it on I
don't know what this does but just got
it anyway that should keep them in place
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna take
this LA Colors eyeliner pencil pen thing
and just the fuck if anything coming off
oh my god it's sorry transparent and
it's like as hard as a rock
I don't think it's gonna come off on my
iron no matter how hard I try it I'm
just gonna give up on that instead I'm
just gonna go back to that black
eyeshadow and this little brush and
lower key just like push it into my
lashline
okay so moving on to mascara I've got
the amused cosmetics waterproof mascara
oh god I hope this isn't shit to get off
and I'm just gonna go straight up bowing
here not bad at all that literally does
what kind of any other mascara does
despite the fact that these shadows had
a lot of Fallout they're pretty good
they're pigmented they blend they pack
on color not all that bad for my lashes
today I've got these ones from a or a
studio and these are 100% natural hair I
don't even want to know what that means
but it says it there cruelty free on the
back
natural hair how would that work you
know this is what they look like so I
just put on a little bit of the House of
lashes black lash glue now I'm just
going to maybe on
sorry it just lashes on and it doesn't
look too bad okay so now it's finally
time to get started on the face I'm
gonna be taking this AR a wonder skin
perfecting Buller primer oh my god
there's literal glitter in it you can't
see it on the skin but there's actually
glitter in this primer
okay that's easy to move around the skin
okay so when it comes to foundation I've
got two different options I've got an
actual foundation or if that doesn't
work out I've got a BB cream so the
foundation that I have is from LA Colors
liquid makeup this is in the shade
natural or we've got this BB cream from
AOA studio BB cream in the shade light
so but I'm gonna give the foundation a
whirl and see if that's any good first
I'm just gonna pump some onto the back
of my hand alright so I'm just gonna
start by I'm just gonna do this little
section of my face and see what I think
and then we'll go from there
okay that literally blends into nothing
so I'm gonna try the BB cream which is a
different shade but we might make it
work
like one dollar foundation Lac I'm gonna
take the butt of my beauty blender and
just gonna pop some more on and try to
blend this in
okay so I think the BB cream is working
better than the foundation oh my god my
skin is going to hate me oh my god why
does that sting so bad all right I'm
just gonna keep blending this in
so I kind of like the finish that this
gives it's like a glowy light to medium
coverage but it's actually really nice
besides the fact that it's seeing my
face the tiniest little bit I'm just
gonna take that BB cream and more or
less just conceal the tops of my brows
right I'm just gonna be applying that
same BB cream all over my forehead
before we move on to the concealer I
wish it was a little bit more full
coverage and then I would really be in
love with it but it's not so we're just
gonna work with that okay so now going
in with the concealer I'm gonna use the
same one that I used on my eyes today
I'm also just gonna put it
under my eyes well
all right so I'm just gonna start
blending this all in and out I've got
this dresser quick and I didn't realize
oh my god
okay so dis concealer dries super super
quick so I would not recommend doing
this I just recommend doing an inception
just conceal that it's super full
coverage but it does dry very quick the
one dollar one yeah I know it's full
coverage as fuck okay so to bake my
undereyes I've got the same thing the AR
a perfect setting powder oh my god it
just squirted absolutely everywhere
someone's gonna dip my beauty blender
into this powder and just press it into
where I've put all the concealer
and I'm also just gonna pop this all
over my noses of Wawa and pretty much
over my whole entire face just just set
everything into place
all right so I'm going to finish off my
under eyes now
sorry to start the contouring process
I'm just gonna be taking and these
contour shades there's a few highlight
ones in here too I got this one as a
contour and this one is kind of like a
bronzer and then these as highlights and
I've got a few more highlights as well
so I'm gonna take this cold tone shade
first and begin the process
but I'm just gonna keep on carrying on
all right so now I'm just gonna go in
with the warmer tone shade and kind of
very pigmented beware and I'm just gonna
bring that older man neck choose to
everything matches up and of course I'm
just gonna bring a little bit across my
forehead and whatever is left over on
the brush just gonna run down the side
of my nose wow that has taken off some
of my foundation like it's just
mysteriously disappeared for my nose
I'll show you guys afterwards on the
close-up now blush I don't really have
anything because I didn't get anything
because I didn't have anything in stock
so for highlighter I'm just gonna be
taking at this shade right here it looks
really nice oh my god wait Lily these
highlighters a fucking lit they're a
dollar come look how cool is that and
then I've got all I've got all of these
ones as well thank you I'm just gonna go
over with somebody's fun
sorry nice sorry I'm just going in with
these highlighters and I'm shook there
gorge I'm a little I'm just gonna add a
little bit more
it's like iridescent tea pink one here
sugar block oh my god it's the flowers
that's why I've been sniffing all
fucking day and like sneezing holy
thought I need to get I need to get him
out I know but they need to go there's
got to throw them in the bin I'm also
just gonna pop a little bit on the inner
corners of my eyes just to brush um
tomorrow it's gonna be 42 degrees in
Melbourne yeah I'm not going anywhere
I'll go to the tattoo place out of the
Erie bar and back in the Erie but that's
it okay guys sir I have these true lip
shades here actually
like 12 of the colors but thing is the
only ones that appealed to me so this is
in the shade divine and once against us
by the brand called ara studio
it's like a liquid lipstick I guess this
is the only shade that I remotely lacked
out of them all okay sorry this is what
everything looks like I'm gonna give you
guys a close-up nice they can fully have
a sauce okay guys so this is what
everything looks like up close have a
good old sauce now the foundation has
come off my nerves and a few little pots
yeah I know that you can really tell
maybe cuz it just hasn't stuck down
puppy because I've probably got oil on
my nose and the concealer has gone a
little patchy in this area here but
these highlighters here like I'm
actually shocked like I'm gonna put
these into my makeup drawers and
incorporate them into regular videos
because for a dollar they're fucking
good and the lip color is like wow
