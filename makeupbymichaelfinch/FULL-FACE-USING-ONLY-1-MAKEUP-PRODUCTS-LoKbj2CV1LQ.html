today I'm gonna be doing the full face
of makeup using only products that are
costing $1 so basically all the products
I'm using basically cost me $1 I think
they were a dollar 30 Australian dollars
because of the u.s. conversion rate
because of the website that I got them
off I'll leave the website link down
below if for anyone who's interested so
I'm really really excited to be doing
this because I don't know I just am like
my whole face it's not gonna cost me
much at all now one thing that the
website didn't have was primer so I'm
just not gonna prep at all today and I'm
just gonna go straight in with my let's
duke foundation first now I just want to
say that I tried to get brushes and
everything but all the brushes were out
of stock the primers are out of stock so
I'm just gonna be using my brushes that
I have here but don't say I didn't try
it because I tried but they were all out
of stock it was like one brush and I'm
like what's the point of even getting
that but what I did get was a complexion
sponge so I'm gonna give this a shot
today and see how it goes with the
foundation that I got so this is the
foundation that I'm working with us from
a brand called LA Colors and it's in the
shade beige or something that's in the
shade natural my dad so what I'm gonna
do is I'm just gonna pop that onto my
hand I'm worried if I'm gonna grab a
regular foundation brush and I mean I
need something a lot darker than this
but I do have some press powders that I
got that were quite dark so I wonder how
they're gonna go a bitch I'm gonna break
out for about after this video like so
bad as soon as I'm gonna feel me I'm
gonna run into the bathroom and have a
shower and get this all off and assume
you guys in a little bit so you can
sleep better
this is literally like water this
foundation is just it's got no coverage
whatsoever
it's got slight coverage but not enough
for me like you guys know I let my
full-blown coverage but after all the
foundation was a dose or what else do I
expect okay okay now it's gonna get
heaps more of that on my hand because I
feel like the coverage is not buildable
with this at all and I was gonna dip
that sponge into it oh my god it's are
sticky and just bouncing over my face
this is actually so hard to use because
it's like the sponge that I'm using is
taking all the foundation off and one
little swipe
and that's what happens okay so this is
definitely not my color but we're gonna
make it work that's what I always say
and I'm just gonna see if we can make
this work okay not gonna lie do not
purchase this fucking foundation whoa
well I puts I really really put store
much foundation on my face and it has
not covered much Oh hopefully we have
some luck this is the concealer from a
brand called a muse so it's got all
different colors in it I hope it was a
full coverage I doubt it though
damn it so I'm just gonna take this skin
colored sort of shade these treating
here and I'm just gonna
I mean as well put this over my whole
fucking face thing as the foundation
didn't do shit Calvin's gonna put this
concealer all over everything
oh it smells like party makeup you know
when you go to like the party shop and
they have makeup they're like cream
makeup that's what it smells like okay
I'm just gonna take my sponge again and
try and blend this up
excuse my tan hands by the way I know
people are gonna say stuff about it I
know guys I know I'm very lazy when it
comes to tan and that's coming off soon
anyways too much dress okay this
concealer is not that bad and I'm
actually happy that it's working I'm
just gonna be taking some more of that
light shade and I'm gonna be using it to
highlight my under eye area you know
what for a dollar this concealer really
is not all that bad okay not gonna lie
there have a fucking moment to bake this
when I don't have any translucent powder
because they didn't have any just taking
my sponge and attempting to blend this
out this already feels so thick and
gross oh and by the way no offense to
anyone who you I don't mean any offense
to anyone who uses these products in
your everyday life I'm glad they work
for you but this is just my opinion of
the products now just taking the dark
warm shade from this concealer palette
I'm just gonna be putting that around
the hmm I mean am I am I actually what
do we think about that so just to
slightly warm up the face and darken and
conceal the areas that the foundation
did not work on should it's actually so
orange will this concealer is definitely
not working for what I wanted it to
black for now to Bank my under eye and
my highlight I'm gonna have it just get
him to do that I'm just taking this
Santi mineral compact powder I'm just
gonna take the sponge along with this
and like rub it around in there and get
as much product as I can all this looks
good I'm just gonna
why did I do this
it might work in my work in my work so
I'm just putting down this all over the
highlighted areas don't know why because
it's just darkened it completely but
this doesn't even look that dark but I
understand I'm just gonna take a little
bit more of that light concealer and
just use it across my eyelids as a base
for my shadows for when that's ready to
go down I'm just kind of wiping off that
Bank because I don't know what is going
on now I'm taking this dark a sort of
pressed powder by the brand called
Malibu blitz and this is in the shade
light but it doesn't look light at all
like the other one looks lighter so
that's hurt this is actually dark and
I'm just gonna take this on this bigger
brush and try and set the rest of my
face all the foundation and concealer
has actually come off my forehead and I
have no idea why what the fuck for my
bronzer today I'm just gonna be using it
this bronzer here and I'm just gonna
take you sort of massive fluffy brush
well it's my face up woah holy shit man
this is sorry pigmented and not to
mention orange come on give me Sun but
not in a good way
it looks like bronzy in the path the
contact but when you go to put it on
it's like oh my go ahead I don't have
anything to come to it with at all
welcome to photo that's because I have
nothing in stock well they didn't have
anything at all this kind of looks like
the makeup I do all the time
orange duffle coverage about definitely
the orange parts corrector pen just
bronzing up my jaw line a bit now I have
this eye shadow here from a brand called
princess a and I want to see if I can
contour a little bit with this is that
risky or is it gonna work so I'm just
gonna take a little bit of this shadow
cut that off
okay level up some mess okay I'm just
gonna try contour with this eyeshadow oh
shit I'm looking our e-news I don't have
what I'm looking at murder but I'm not
liking it at all I'm just going to take
some more of that powder that I used
earlier on my sponge and I'm just gonna
kinda well I mean there we go clean up
this mess that I've got here I'm just
gonna do a little attempt to contour my
nose slightly just with this bronzer
here all right
okay I'm actually not that unhappy with
this it's looking pretty good now for my
blush today I'm gonna be using this
blush here I'm gonna be using a mixture
of this one here and this one here
didn't happen to this is we'll soon find
out won't we
that's just a little bit one last bit of
pink to the face hasn't it now baby I
mean yeah I'm actually just gonna take
this shade here from the palette and I'm
just gonna take it on my talking brush
as I like to call it and pop it under my
eye to see if it brightens it because I
feel like it's such a of white sort of
color oh my god it worked and just a bit
across my forehead where I would
normally highlight that chin and Cupid's
bow just like what in that area a little
bit maybe gonna shoot my highlighter
today I'm going to be using this palette
here they did not have any highlighter
palettes or highlighters or anything
like that on the website where I was
flying off so I'm just gonna be using
this white shade here and I'm actually
not that disappointed in the pigment
like it's pretty big mature which is
gouged so I'm just gonna be taking a
little bit from that palette tapping
that off and just straight onto though
come on guys it's not that bad
you know what these products aren't even
that bad for anyone who was starting out
in makeup just like practicing and stuff
and like you don't want to spend too
much on it these products aren't that
bad but you can always make it work and
accord
by the government in life is work with
what you've got oh the highlight is not
that bad I can't talk just a little bit
across the tip of my nose my nose bridge
just to bring it to life
oh come on Cupid's bow gonna take my
brush and just dust off that stuff that
I have there before has I cleaned it up
a bit I don't think so but that's right
moving on to my eyebrows because they
have nothing for eyebrows at all I had
to get this matte eyeshadow palette once
again that's what the baby looks like
from a brand called a leg colors so this
is the brow that we're working with
which isn't that bad this is taking me
so much time because this is the darkest
like shadow that I've got to work with
and I mean I'm just gonna take some of
the eyeshadow that I used to contour and
just trying to fill in the ends of my
brows because if you like this shutter
is darker yeah but uh not sure it's
gonna run through my entire brow with
this color a bit I'm just gonna take
some well concealer and just clean up
under that brow
okay so this is ignore the fact that my
brows are completely uneven when my face
is basically an orange besides that it
still looks alright in my opinion well
let's just completely love the fact that
my highlight is popping severely because
well I mean it is looking like rocks off
let's move on to the eyes let's get this
ship done I'm just gonna be taking this
a bronzy eyeshadow this is from the
brand called princess a doughnut it's
associated with shot miss a at all so
this is what it looks like I'm just
gonna take a little bit of that and
we'll cut my finger oh there's no doubt
about by I'm just gonna run that through
the crease and I'm just gonna be using
this is like kind of like a transition
and just kind of like bronzing up the
eye area you're not actually really
impressed with this I shudder it blends
it's not chalky it's got pigmentation
except this concealer under my brow has
gone holla patchy but let's just ignore
that notice the world it's a matte brown
shade that I use to contour I'm just
gonna put that on the outer V of my eye
how's it looking live right now just
taking this eyeshadow palette here I was
gonna take this shimmery a black color
well it definitely has it the zero
pigment to it
come on okay well this is a flop oh my
god what a mess okay I'm just gonna put
a little bit more on the outer V of this
eye and then I'm gonna attempt to blend
this out all shit fall out
I'm going right back to that brown
shimmery shadow and see if I can blend
out this black because it's just turned
it into a massive shit fest I'm just
gonna take it this a gold shade this
creamy sort of gold shade and I'm just
gonna put this all over my lid why do I
always try and do such some medical
books when I do challenges like this
it's just not worth it it just never
works out the way I want it to
now I'm gonna attempt to a wing with
this liquid liner from the brand called
Joo I don't even know anyway what I'm
gonna do is just go this way up this
liquid liner actually isn't that bad if
you have a good hand for liquid liner
then this is pretty much for underneath
my eyes today I'm just gonna be using
some of this brown shadow here
straight under my lower lashline once
that's all done let's move on to
misguides from the brand called la
colors and I'm just gonna take that I'll
come on
what what about this mascara is a piece
of shit now just for a little bit of
black eyeliner in my waterline this is
from the brand mmm some bullshit wank
and I'm just gonna be putting that in my
waterline okay once that's all in my
waterline I'm just gonna take this
little brush again and just kind of
blend that down for my lashes today
these are from the brand called Cara and
these are in the shade DW so I just put
a little bit of everyday a lash glue on
here already to stick on I'm just gonna
be plopping that strike on these lashes
are so small you can't even tell that
I've got them on now and last but not
least is my lips this is from the brand
called clean color matte lead matte lip
gloss matte lip gloss sort of understand
that and yeah I don't know what it is oh
I kind of like the color and that is
everything all done so this is the
completed look of everything done on my
face every single product I used was
only one Abdullah and yeah if you I
think that I completely smashed this
give it a thumbs up but if you think I
failed doing it be one you can give a
thumbs down okay still writing anyway
guys I rep you enjoy the rest of your
mat day wherever in the world you are
and I'll see you all again in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
