today I thought I would do another full
face challenge now this full face
challenge is in full phase using only
jail / prison makeup now I've got this
challenge myself I haven't seen anyone
to look for a research of Google I've
never seen anyone do a full face
challenge using prison flash gel maker
now you might be asking what is prison /
channel makeup so in jail a lot of time
makeup isn't allowed or it's frowned
upon I guess so if people make makeup
with what they've got so food coffee
like different things like that so I did
some research and I found so much stuff
that they use in jail to do their makeup
with it's really really interesting like
what they do and it's a little
disclaimer I don't want you upset anyone
or offend anyone in this video it's just
entertainment purposes only I was
actually inspired by watching orange is
the new black I did watch an old episode
last night the one where pipe are like
almost no the girl almost killed Piper
that little rap looking girl anyway so
this is the full face using prison /jo
makeup let's get straight into it if you
guys are new here don't forget to hit
that subscribe button to keep up with
all my future videos and if you enjoyed
this video don't forget to share with
your friends and press the like button
down below because it will help me out a
lot okay so first thing we're going to
be doing is filling in at my eyebrows
you know what they use to do our browser
these are instant coffee powder or
cinnamon powder mix with like water or
Vaseline or something like that so what
I'm going to do today is I've got a
little bit of instant coffee patterns
here I'm going to expect with a tiny bit
of water and mush it all up to fill in
my brows fuck doesn't weigh too much so
just got some coffee and what are the
don't mix things up in here I think I
put too much water can put seeing as the
more coffee to make it a bit more
thicker because this is going to be our
eyebrow hard core made well so it's
macaron a coffee which is like one of
the best coffees in Australia so I'm
just going to dip my brush into that
concoction that which is made up and
start filling in my brows oh my god it's
working oh my god it's working
it's kind of orange through my eyebrow
but it definitely is
so I did quite a bit of research to find
out you know what they do in jail like
for makeup and everything like that and
this is everything that I've found so
it's actually kind of educational and
interesting as well it's not just like
about the video it's about like learning
also and I found out some cool little
interesting facts about jail and stuff
like that beauty related makeup related
so there is one brow all filled in it
actually works you guys and I'm sure
there's different sorts of coffee that
have different colors like oranges like
Browns blacks like all different sorts
of copies will have to recolor so I'm
sure they were very experimental and
very artistic when it came to their
makeup and what they could do okay so
there are my brows all done they're
looking a little bit orange in color but
what can you expect it's instant coffee
so I tried to find what they use for
primer and there was nothing I was
thinking maybe they use hair sprays like
said it or hair spray is like a primer
for a base nothing couldn't find
anything so they just go straight into
foundation for modern websites a
foundation for carnation they use a
little bit of vaseline or just any sort
of moisturizer lotion
we've got cinnamon powder chips you make
the color and then to make it a little
bit lighter if we need to we've got some
a baby powder also and that's pretty
much it a family Magda Foundation and
they whack it on their face but let's
give this a shot so I'm just going to do
Fort Worth solution you guys know how
much I love my foundation so we're going
to need extra today maybe six square one
no props or wood yeah I'm just going to
mix it a tiny bit of cinnamon powder so
this is really smooth not grainy door
which is perfect for our foundation base
now I'm going to stir that up sobbing -
good that's not thank you but we're
gonna make it work thank you yeah what
I'm going to do is create some baby
powder - maybe this will give a lot of
creamy consistency so I'm just maybe
that'll make it a bit better I don't
know
oh it's more like a mixture of cinnamon
and baby data because that's what it is
all right this is the color that we're
working with I'm just going to put some
more baby powder to make it a bit
lighter because I don't have any scent
town now we need to match it to my neck
so horrible MacGuffin is bulkier and
this is a concoction of foundation oh my
god I didn't mix today
probably give it a bit of a mix up again
okay so what I'm going to do is they
didn't have any brushes I don't think
maybe they had a few brushes I don't
know but I'm just going to go thank you
and we are going to disperse this around
my face you're joking you are garbage I
again I honestly don't think this would
have worked
I mean it's giving me a little bit of
coverage it smells really good it's not
gonna lie its mouth clean and fresh and
like cinnamon and baby powder I don't
know how I would apply this to my face
besides this part this way if you think
about what I'm going to use a concealer
nothing because they didn't do concealer
in jail let's see if I can cover these
two pimples here with my foundation not
bad this is a close-up of what the
foundation looks like I mean I just had
a little interval and the foundation has
dried and it is very very don't know
what to say about this one anyway we're
just going to work with it and keep
going through this we've got this do not
give up thank you for my eyeliner and
lip liner today I'm just going to be
using to use colored pencils again and
just a little disclaimer if I was you I
would not use this on your eye area or
your skin in general probably update to
the eye area but I'm going to take it so
I'm going to do it please don't do it
right fucking role model here thank you
because I do it but if you do it's not
so thank you so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to take is a black pencil and
I'm also going to take the red pencil
lip liner and eyeliner perfect I also
have a glass of lukewarm like kind of
hot water I'm just going to sit these in
there while I move on to the next step
so if I shadow in jail they used to
actually use from what I've read I'm not
saying to everyone did before everyone
does this is this is from what I've read
and my own research and whatnot they
need to use a Vaseline on their eyes as
a base and then I found it really
interesting too they used to actually
get old birthday cards they used to
previously ask for glitter birthday
cards so they could scratch the glue off
and stick it to their eyelids
I think that's really creative and
really really cool so let's do my
eyeshadow so they used to use a little
bit of cinnamon cocoa powder or coffee
through their cream sugar for like a bit
of a cream color so I'm going to do just
that before we do the eyelid actually
first I'm just going to apply a little
bit of Vaseline to the tops of my eyelid
just to get our base going on brow
crease color and our glutes are so I'll
just pop some Vaseline on my eyelid my
skin's gonna hate me after this actually
got a facial done yesterday my skin was
so clean and fresh now putting all this
fucking food and makeup and not even
makeup pencils and shit on it I don't
know what's gonna happen
so my eyeshadow today I'm actually gonna
be using some Dutch cocoa powder which
is just like a chocolate base through
powder I guess to make chocolate cake
you should I start so I'm just going to
get a little bit of my brush into there
and then I'm just going to put this
through my crease so this is the eyes
that we're doing today guys so I'm just
taking that on my blending brush and
kind of blending up I honestly thought
this would work a little bit better but
it's gotten kind of Davo but they're
very limited to what we can you actually
know that's not even that bad that's
giving me some color and I'm sure they
won't will makeup artists in jail anyway
Alexa the Lisa there was two fucks about
a blended I show and whatnot not too bad
so as I was saying earlier they use the
glitter from birthday cards and stuff to
put on their eyelids I went out and what
this is has in cake relevant so what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to scratch
off the glitter with my nail and just
comes off a tree oh yeah there we go
perfect cut up so I'm just going to pop
that on my ah that's actually cool like
this is so creative I feel like this was
a bit of an educational video it's not
too far but I don't owe you guys that's
cool it's going to pop a little bit on
this side as well
I don't know if this glitter is ice X I
wouldn't recommend is either but I'm a
risk-taker as I said yeah okay let's
move on to the rest of the face mascara
was obviously non-existent how I was
non-existent but what I'm going to do
for highlight is I'm just going to take
a little bit of faster loading just on
my cheek brain areas and what I'm going
to do is a little bit of glitter on
there too so we have a bit of a glory
going on you know what I mean Oh
here we go polls coming together now
once you are going for the gods you need
to let everybody know to put your
sunblock on Peter blending with your
extravagant proline thank you sir I
don't know if they come to an in jail I
don't know they probably did personal
preference so what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to take a brush and I'm
just going to take a little bit of cocoa
powder once again surely this was the
foundation that they use because I mean
in anything that looks work like what
just contouring the jawline a little bit
as well gosh cocoa powder does not lend
our whatsoever don't forget to snatch
that nose of yours
perfect so by now my pencil should be
done so I was going to take out the
black one and I'm going to see how to do
a bit of a wing oh my god I'm swearing
off for a minute that's literally it
literally just taking off the shadow is
there any treatment in this little sheet
okay well the pencil is a fail I might
try the red one on my lips are fucking
hurt okay so definitely the pencil is
not going to work either
awesome okay for our last up today let's
do some lip color and a little bit of
blush and they used cherries I went to
Cole's which is the Australian Transport
supermarket here and I've got one cherry
and it was played by pence though I'm
not spending $7 on a planet cherries on
anyone and I hate cherries they smell
their growth I just don't like them I do
like it so I'm just going to cut off a
little bit of mint sugar
well the color is so strong I'm going to
put a little bit on my cheeks for blush
oh yeah and now for the lip color I love
the pigmentation would be so much better
this pageant really works do the last
bit disappointing
maybe I'll just get the juices flowing a
little bit more okay never use be sure
to go anywhere get beetroot some are
insane something in my house so this is
pretty much it all the typing it would
look a lot better than this but it was
still fun to do it's fun to try out and
