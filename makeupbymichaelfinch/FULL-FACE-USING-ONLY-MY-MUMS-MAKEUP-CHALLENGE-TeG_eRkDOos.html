today I'm gonna be filming a full face
of makeup using only my mom's makeup so
I said to my mom can you pick out some
makeup for me to use in this video and
I've got a bag just next to me I don't
know what's in there so I'm just gonna
dip in and see if I can do a full face
using her makeup and to be honest I'm
kind of worried about this because I
don't think I'm gonna nail it because
she doesn't even do her eyebrows so what
the am I going to use okay first
thing we've got is this amazingly
stunning eyeshadow palette and it smells
like an eBay palette okay now I don't
think we have any primer okay because my
mum does not use primer so thanks for
that mum oh my god
so for foundation we are using the
maybelline superstay 24 hours I mean and
I've never used this foundation before
let's see how it goes I'm really worried
about the eyes during how they're going
to go either but look let's just throw
to the best okay all right it's
definitely not my color
far out okay this isn't a very good
stuff that's right we can make it work
don't stray so I got this so I'm just
going to start pounding that into my
skin so when I was talking to my dad
doing this challenge she said I want you
to do a smoky eye she wants like a blue
she wants to see me nail a smoky eye
with that eyeshadow palette that I just
showed you
everyone just stop what you're doing
whatever you're doing stop say prayer
because I'm going to need it we can
clown shower can we contour I don't
think we've got a contour hour or even a
bronzer hey mom how do you use bronzer
or contour are you serious how there's a
contour on bronze I never use it
oh okay Boman now that my foundation is
all done now I'm actually surprised when
my mum actually has a concealer and it
is the women women it is the Rimmel wake
me up in the shade it doesn't even
 say well that's handy isn't it
so I'm just going to take that oh my God
look how dark this is mum you know I
like a strong highlight thank you so
much
I got it too literally empty how is she
nothing's oh my god is that all I get
out of this tube
um it's using there's like literally no
concealer left in this thing no nose
noon yeah I've got another stick I use
alright so I'm just going to work with
just concealer Wow look at that amazing
highlight bar oh oh it out alright
I'm just gonna take my Beauty Blender
and blend that out oh my god we don't
have translucent powder how the
moment to bag
well I can't even bake in my face yo
dude yeah right I'm quite impressed with
this so far look it's not all that bad I
wish that under a highlighter was a bit
you know stronger but what can you do
about that
ah do you know what I'll do do you not
 do alright so we've got this
powder here this is the Curtis
collection I gave this to my ages ago
um Oh shitty dick shitty dick because I
really want to bake on my undereyes so
I'm just going to get this powder sorry
my I'm scratching her then I'm just
going to scrape off powder so that I can
just do my Beauty Blender into this so
I'm just basically stretching oh my god
I can't even talk when I do this because
I just got it everywhere so I'm just
gonna go straight in with my Beauty
Blender back into that powder this is so
dark guys oh oh he did it
it's yellow holy
look are you actually me right
now I mean okay now this is quite funny
mum actually bought this the other day
and she hasn't opened it yet she's like
you can be the first one to use it in
featuring me video this is the model
code contour stick so I'm trying to
upgrade us up in the world so she had
bought a contour stick knob did she even
conscious she doesn't even have a
contour powder or bronze which goes out
and buys a stick underneath my
eyes looks like seriously like a
sand it looks like baby diarrhoea get
over there now bindi all right I'm just
going to take this contour stick and oh
my god
okay okay oh my god I might be able to
 contour with this I just
gotta blend it out right okay everyone
pray for me I'm gonna need to thank you
oh my god what the is this this
really does not want to blend out at all
I'm just going to run this around the
top of my forehead now if you're going
to be doing quite a lot of this today
just because we don't actually have a
powder bronzer mom actually gave me some
eyeshadow to contour with so thanks mum
I mean this stuff dries so quickly I'm
actually just going to change from my
Beauty Blender to like this brush hoping
that this is a bit more intense and like
blends it out better that's better but
that actually ones are nicely with this
brush okay perfect we're getting
somewhere now get under that bitch
snores a breath okay this bag has turned
my under eyes completely yellow it looks
 disgusting so I'm just going to
take that powder that I used to bake on
my under eyes and set the rest of my
face of disks oh geez I'm actually just
gonna swipe off that bag because it's
really not doing me any favors
whatsoever thanks mum and it's still
yellow you're dry now let's move on to
blush
hey Chloe so I'm using the Elizabeth
Arden blush in the shade
sunburst 0-1 and that looks just amazing
perfect so I'm just taking me to this
Rouge as my mum would say and I'm just
plopping that on my cheeks and brushing
back and this is not pigmented at
all and it's not helping me much okay
well this is the biggest piece of
that I've ever used
come on blush Tom the for a babe
what the is this pretty color
palette got some nice colors in there
okay let's see what we can do with that
oh there's a second oh my god there's a
second part I could've used that to bake
my under eyes that I'm just going to go
over my under eyes with that cutter to
see if this brightens it up a little bit
cuz I am so yellow under there and it
looks really disgusting oh yes my
prayers have been answered
whoo this is stressing me out okay let's
move on to the eye area I'm just going
to zoom you guys a little bit they can
feel a bit closer mother you really
wanted what okay so I'm going to be
taking this eyeshadow palette here and
we've got amazing amounts of color in
here
as you can see stunning now while we're
in this a shadow palette mom says that
she likes to use this color for
highlighter so I'm just going to pop
some of this highlighter on so I've just
got just here I'm just gonna you know I
mean not that bad and I'm also just
going to bring a little bit of that
under my brow bone area not that I've
done my brows yet but I will but I'm
just gonna do my Cupid's bow as well you
know actually isn't that bad for a
highlight okay so that I should have
palette is all shimmery now I want to
use that so I'm going to go in back into
this piece of makeup here and I'm gonna
be taking these two colors here choose
as a transition rate for me okay what
I'm going to draw a vertical foundation
over my eyelids too because Mundell even
use an eye base well she does but she's
at his concealer and she's used it all
up so and I'm just gonna plug that into
my outer crease area and kind of blend
out and upwards but I'm going to take it
this darker Brown here and I'm gonna
plug that into my out of B Wow amazing
now as my mom she said she wanted to see
a blue smoky eye so I'm going to be
taking these two shades here but I'm
just gonna put that onto my lid I mean
where's the pigmentation err okay let's
work with those guys let's work with it
okay that looks a mess but we're
gonna work with it okay it's turning
into like a fest color let up in
this inner corner here not pretty at all
so my mum does not have a black eyeliner
or she's run out of it whatever she's
telling me whatever she's giving me I'm
just using who's going to be popping
that into my waterline now before this
eyeliner dries I'm just going to try to
letting it out with that blue that I
used on my lid again you know
a little bit something-something and I'm
just gonna
feel like something's happening in my
eyes right now and I don't like it now
because I'm just so extra at all I'm
gonna be taking this eyeshadow palette
again and I'm going to be taking this
really dark black color just in here a
little bit of stuff something underneath
my under eye area to like document a bit
now for mascara today I didn't want to
use my mom's Lima because like
conjunctivitis bitch I mean so I'm just
going to be using the Rimmel London
mascara just to put that on my eyelashes
and this wand scares me or what
or what or now I can't don't look at
that lashes something's gonna plop the
lashes on and I'll be right back
oh my God my eyebrows how the can I
forget once again I'm gonna be going
back to my favorite palette ever and I'm
just gonna be taking this a darker Brown
here on just an angled brush and I'm
gonna see if I can start oh the fallout
that just occurred was nuts getting a
bit of an arch going on up here this is
not pigmented enough to overdraw just
working on the top i'm just whoa
and i'm just going to take that shadow
and kind of blend it towards the front
of the brow um my mom doesn't feel her
eyebrows in it or she literally gets a
spoolie and goes boom perform it done
now I'm just going to take my Beauty
Blender again and I'm going to go into
this pressed powder here and I'm just
going to wipe it across there and I'm
just going to see if I can clean up my
contour a bit well I'm simply let that
sit on there for a little bit and I feel
like I need an inner corner highlight so
I'm just going to take the highlighter
from this eyeshadow palette again and
just pop that on my inner corner just on
here so straight from pan to face just
so nobody thinks I'm cheating I'm gonna
plop that on my inner corner whoa a
highlighter just under my brow bone to
really make that area pop now I'm just
going to brush off that baked for my
contour that's actually cleaned it up a
little bit the line looks really harsh
on camera but I swear flat in person so
if you guys remember when I did a video
where my last I used is taut the pencil
on her and so I'm just going to be using
that today so I'm just taking some of
that a lip pencil from Tarte on a brush
applying that to my lip sorry this is
the final look and I used all of my
mum's makeup to complete this challenge
if you guys think that I did a really
good job of this challenge makes you
give me a thumbs up and if you're new
here and you haven't hit that subscribe
button don't forget to hit to keep up
with all my future videos because you
don't want a mother bugger miss out I'm
telling you I'm actually quite impressed
with how this turned out and I'm gonna
go and show my mum and hopefully she's
quite impressed as well anyway guys I
hope you enjoy the rest of your night or
day wherever the world you are and I'll
