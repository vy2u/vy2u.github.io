today's tutorial is actually gonna be a
little bit different it's something
completely different to what I normally
do this is a graphic aligner tutorial I
just want to let you guys know that
today's video is actually sponsored by
Priceline which is social because some
day I started make up I have been
shopping at Priceline and I still do to
this day and it's sort of 'some when you
get to work with brands that you truly
do love so basically a Priceline has
worked with their makeup director which
is Ray Morris I love her I met her I'm
at and she's so friggin sweet so they've
teamed up with Ray to set the trend for
the season so one of them is a graphic
lines and that's what I've done today
sorry everything that I use in today's
video is available at Priceline so
Australians there you go super easy
I strongly love this with products I
found some old products that I do love
using so yeah without any photos ray
let's get straight into this video and
if you guys do enjoy this make sure you
give it a massive thumbs up and yeah
let's do it okay guys let's get straight
into it so first of all I'm just going
to be taking the Maybelline anti age
rewind concealer now this is one of my
favorite drugstore concealers this is
literally everything and I've actually
just rediscovered this because I totally
forgot about it for a probably a good
year so I'm just putting that all over
my eyelids planning that out with my
Real Techniques sponge and then I'm
setting it with some Maybelline mapmaker
mattifying powder basically this is just
a mattifying powder that sets your
foundation or concealer
so then straight after that we're going
to be going into the graphic liner now
graphic liner for me I still struggle
with this it's very very hard in my
opinion and gave me a lot of anxiety but
the end result was worth it because what
I created was very different to what I
normally do so I'm just gonna let this
graphic liner tutorial go on and I'm
just going to play a bit of music just
until I finish the liner to the dogs go
on for a while but watch and enjoy and
I'll see you in a few minutes
and this is what the eyeliner looks like
very different it kind of looks like two
little bug eyes but I kind of love it so
I'm just taking this models prefer
makeup wipe just to get rid of any
excess oil or anything on my face that I
don't want in preparation for the
foundation so I'm just going to be
taking the maybelline baby skin primer
and just applying that all over my face
just kind of just blurs the pores a
little bit and gives you a better
application for your foundation now for
foundation I'm going to be using the
l'oreal infallible total color this is a
new one that's just launched in
Australia a few weeks ago and it's not
too bad it's got a very rosy sort of
texture
I like it but I feel like it's a little
bit hard to work with in a way but you
can actually make it work you just need
to blend it out so I'm just blending all
that out with my Real Techniques sponge
once again and just really pressing it
into the skin and I'm just blending away
you know all over my lips I feel like
this foundation color is perfect to me
because it's got a rosy undertone to it
I'll leave the shade name down below if
anyone's interested but your actual
access has got this is a really good
time for my skin
and then going back into that Maybelline
anti age rewind concealer once again and
I'm putting on my chin Cupid's bow my
nose and my forehead just to highlight
the t-zone area of my space and just
give a little bit more coverage to this
whole entire look and just blending it
out with my sponge and you know you know
how we do oh blending blending and see
now I'm just taking that concealer
underneath my eyes again I probably use
a little bit too much but is it ever too
much with a michael Finch video
regarding can fill up no exactly that's
what I thought
so I'm just blending that out with my
sponge once again making sure there's no
vines and it is all completely seamless
before I set it with a translucent
powder and I tried out a new translucent
powder today from the drugstore it is
the natio translucent powder finger
place a natio or nato I'm pretty sure
it's natio anyway I tried that out and
off I love it it's probably a little bit
too dark for my under eyes it's just a
translucent but I don't have a tiny bit
of color to it so I probably wouldn't
recommend it for the under eyes but for
some people it might work for maybe just
not for my skin tone because underneath
my eyes I like it to be super super
super bright but I'm to set the rest of
the face it was awesome
I'm also just baking my whole entire
nose like I normally do and then my chin
and my forehead basically everywhere
where I put concealer it just kind of
brightens it a little bit and then I'm
just taking some more of that
translucent powder to set the rest of my
foundation on that this brush here and
this brush is actually really good as
for models prefer from Priceline as well
so I'm just dusting that all over you
know
the mascara today this is the a L'Oreal
telescopic I think it was I'm just
putting that on my top lashes in
preparation for my bowls and lashes so
I'm just squiggling that all over and
making sure every little hair is covered
oh we're moving on to the eyes so to the
eyes this is the models prefer eyeshadow
palette and I'm just going to take that
light pink and just blend that
underneath my eye and then I'm going to
take this dark purple or just on a flat
brush and put it right up against my
lash line so there's a little bit of
dimension underneath my eyes rather than
just having nothing and then a bit more
of that pink shade just to blend out
that dark purple now moving into
contouring this is the models prefer
everything from model Sephora I kind of
love it
this is the model prefer contour kit I'm
just taking at that a dark shade and
starting to carve out my cheekbones and
I was so impressed with the blend
ability of this product it blended so
well like just look at that it doesn't
look muddy or anything it's buildable
its pigmented it's actually pretty good
so I'm probably going to be using just a
lot more as well I'm just taking that
underneath my non-existent jaw line to
kind of create a jaw line as I say and
I'm trying to make my forehead look a
little bit smaller as well by just
contouring me absolute she's out
advanced and contouring away thank you
underneath my bottom lip
that is one of the reasons that I love
doing voiceovers because I can blast
music injure my makeup it's the best
thing ever but then again I do love
talking to you guys anyway moving on to
bronzer businessí models prefer mineral
powder and I'm just taking me bronzy
shades and kind of just bring that over
where I contoured and then I thought I
went a little bit crazy with the contour
and bronzer so I just cleaned it up with
some of that natio translucent powder
and dust it off probably 15 to 20
seconds later any longer than that and
it leaves a white cast guy feel now I'm
just going back in with that bronzer but
I'm taking the little peachy shade and
I'm just popping that on my cheek and
blending it back towards my temples for
mascara today this is the Maybelline
Great Lash I'm just popping that on my
bottom lashes I feel like this is a
really good mascara for bottom lashes it
really gets in there and covers all of
it and makes them look a little bit
spidery but not too spidery that it's
scary to not I mean and then I'm just
going to spritz my face with a bit of
the models prefer makeup setting mist
just before I highlight and I'm going to
be using this small prefer illuminating
palette and this was actually good luck
I really did enjoy it it's a very subtle
highlight but it's perfect for my skin
tone and I feel like it just worked like
look at that look at that amazing I'm
also taking that on my Cupid's bow and
the bridge of my nose with a smaller
brush now for my lip liner I'm just
going to use infinite spice from models
prefer and just over line my lips a
little bit I don't know if I'm over
lining them or going on the line because
my lips are so big I love it
lipstick is mole's prefer naked and I
really like this it's like a brown sort
of nude color oh he looks so good
then I'm just going back in with that
lip liner and kind of blending the
lipstick and the lip liner together and
then I'm setting my face with that
models prefer makeup setting spray again
and putting a little bit of highlight on
my inner corners of mouth pretty much it
