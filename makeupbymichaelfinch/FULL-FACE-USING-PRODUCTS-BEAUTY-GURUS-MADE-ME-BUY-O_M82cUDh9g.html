hello my beautiful people and welcome
back to my channel so today I'm gonna be
doing a super exciting video I'm so
excited to do this now before any of
y'all haters leave a comment saying oh
my god you copied many MUA um I'm
getting there okay give me a break
so for those who don't know a youtuber
called makeup by Jack who's one of my
favorite youtubers I always post him on
my Instagram because I'm literally
obsessed with him when it gets late at
night and I'm bored
I literally just sit and watch these
tutorials I'm sorry I will leave his
link down below if any of you guys are
interested pretty much she came up with
this idea to do like a full face using
makeup products that a beauty guru has
recommended to him and put it into like
a full video sort of thing so then many
MUA came out and did a full face using
makeup beauty gurus made me buy so he
did like all different beauty gurus so
that's what I'm gonna be doing today so
I'm going to leave Jax and manis video
link down below so if you guys want to
go check them out please do because
they're both two very talented youtubers
and this is going to be my own version
of just that video so try to say
virginal version because I said virgin
Wow without any further ado let's get
straight into this video and if you guys
enjoyed my Shiva a massive thumbs up and
let's go
now as you can already tell I've already
done my brows off camera because I just
used all the benefit brow products
because literally I don't think anyone
introduced them to me it's just been me
I found them myself I found my love for
them myself I've been using them for
literally sorry many years ever since I
started makeup and started YouTube so
browser done and the beauty guru that
I'm crediting for that is myself thank
you
so the first product I'm gonna be going
in with today is the Tarte shaped tape
from Tarte now the beauty guru that
introduced this to me was myself so
pretty much before this even came out I
was on tarts pls I'm pretty sure and I'm
they sent it to me before I even came
out and I got to try and I was like holy
fucking shit
I'm obsessed by sorry I've been using it
ever since and it's still my holy grail
to this motherfucking day well I'm
actually such a pig I always burping
videos and I don't crop it out just
because I just drink and fuck so this is
in the shade light/medium honey so I'm
just gonna pop this all over my lids
today and I've already concealed on my
brows because just to fill in time and
save that shit off can wear there I'm
just going to take this on just a flat
brush and just apply it all over the lid
where I'm going to be putting the
eyeshadow cuz it's gone prep for a NASA
is looking base be it yes super full
coverage superstar obsessed I wished I
would bring that shape type to Australia
because I know it's really annoying that
no one can get it in stores in Australia
and tar if you're watching please act on
us because we all want it here so badly
needs to be a Sephora exclusive not just
an ultra exquisite because we don't have
alter and now I'm gonna take my clean
for a change damn Beauty Blender this
part is dirty because I'd literally just
bunked it in some conceal off I'm just
gonna blend this all out okay you know
that is all blended now to set its
powder I'm gonna be using to set this is
the Australis fresh and flawless now
makeup I jazz jazz hand I'm introduced
me to this a long time ago and she used
it on all their clients and said that
it's pretty much better than the Mac
powder foundation and ever since then
I've been like oh my god it's really
good and it's drugstore - so it's super
super cheap it'll blend out those
creases and then I'm just gonna go
straight up on in here just with
little bit of product and just set it
into place now for eyeshadow today I'm
gonna be jumping straight into the
jaclyn hill morphe palette now person
who made me get this was obviously the
Queen herself at Jaclyn looking ass hill
yeah oh wow this is a shitshow and a
half this is being all that this has
literally traveled not all around the
world because I haven't been all around
the world but it's travelled quite a few
places and spent a little bit fucked up
in my suitcase
hence the messy state of it but I'm not
gonna clean it because I simply CBS and
it's just gonna get dirty again
especially after using it today bye Joe
alright sir I'm going to take this a
brown shade and just use it as my
transistor day now what I look am i
doing man you asked no fucking idea as
per usual I'm just gonna see where my
hands take me maybe I should do a halo I
haven't done a halo in so long so I'm
just using this big fluffy brush from
makeup addiction call of the mini and
I'm just gonna lightly put this all
through my crease there in my crease
sorry my fuckin Christ bin day what is
my microphone still recording testing
one fuck yep
yeah Wow hello still blending this
through my crease it's very faint this
color it's quite faint there is a lot of
fucking kick back on this shade of
eyeshadow um but that's not always a bad
thing as long as I pigmented and they're
blending now I'm just gonna grind with
this darker sort of brown you know are
you being d well it's called more like
an orange well I don't really fucking
know what it is I'm just putting it on
my eye and seeing what happens trying to
describe an eye shadow color and I don't
even know what I'm fucking saying
majority of the time so I'm just using a
really light a windshield wiper motions
yeah it's blending blending blending you
can see these colors are quite sauce
whole now I'm gonna take a super orange
color this is where the halo is gonna
start happening you know so imma take it
out on my outer V she's pigmented
I'm gonna put right up on the end of
corner here keeping like the center fray
of the collar you can take more of that
same color just on this more dense brush
this is the zoeva 230 luxe pencil and
I'm morester that's gonna really pack
this colorful one okay now I'm just
gonna take this red brick sort of
looking color it looks like it would
have the name of a red brick and I'm
gonna just take that on the out of it
and smack BAM on that inner corner again
now guys just to keep this nice and
clean I'm just gonna take this blending
brush and just kind of blend the shadows
as I go just to keep it nice and clean
looking rather than a big shift fest
which is what my eye shadow looks
generally tend to turn out like now if
you have hooded eyes like me I like to
bring it above the crease like the color
here and the color here just so you can
see when your eyes open and it's close
that it is still a halo eye alright now
the last core I'm gonna dip into is the
black in the outer corner tap off the
shit that you don't need and then I'm
just gonna go to town I'm gonna keep
this really quite close to the lash line
it's gonna kind of plunk it on them and
I'll blend it out in a minute actually
looks pretty good I'm pretty proud of
myself doing a different look for a
change different look not different
colors but we can do I'm just gonna dip
back into that red brick color and I'm
just gonna take the exo Beauty small
blender brush and I'm just gonna kind of
blend over the edge of the black lately
I've been doing a really light moves
with the eye shadow brush and it tends
to pack the color on better and blend it
out like as you go so rather than going
harsh because when I first started
makeup I would always go straight in
harsh with the brush and some pellets
you do have to work with harshly but
other ones you just have to go super
super lightly and it blends it all for
you and literally does all the work if
you just like literally just touch your
skin
and that's nothing doing lately and I've
been loving it now for the center of my
lid I'm gonna take a flat brush black
deer and I'm gonna take this really
pretty like a rose gold or almost
fucking shade and then I'm gonna take a
little bit of my talk cha Juiz skin mist
spray that on the brush and then I'm
just taking a little bit more on the
brush and then I'm gonna just pack it in
the middle and I'm gonna bring a black
above my crease just like I have with
the other eyeshadows cool cool and I was
gonna take that red brick color again
tap off the shit and then I'm just gonna
slightly really slightly just kind of
just like blend into the shimmery shade
being careful not to touch too much
that's looking pretty halo issues in it
please tell me it is I think it is being
D okay guys so the next product I'm
gonna be taking is the IMC jawline and
now make up by JA introduce me to this
and I have never ever ever looked back
it is the best gel liner that I have
used to date ever
this is the zoeva 317 winged liner brush
this is from menu collection I believe
holy Shi guys brushes sorry easy to use
there we go just a really nice like
tight line across the top lash now just
because I'm a little bit extra today I'm
just gonna take the black shadow from
the morphe palette and then imma just
like kind of blend it a little bit just
on the outer edge it's a little bit
smoky air alright so I'm so quickly go
ahead and read this side off camera just
to save time and then we'll come back
finish the eyes and get started on early
face whoa so this is now John I'm gonna
just clean my shit sorry sorry moving on
to mascara I'm just gonna be taking the
L'Oreal voluminous mascara this is the
carbon black I've had this for so long
and the person who made me buy it was
Mario Jenner how to say the last name
because whatever better team
Kardashian's makeup artist and he
literally spoke about this and said it
was so black and so volumizing and like
a really matte black like it's he said
it's the blackest mascara has ever used
so
this is why I have this and I really do
like it I don't use it much in tutorials
because you can only get it in America
it's not an Australian stores but I know
you can buy it some places online but it
really does make your lashes sorry black
no black that makes it incredibly
interesting in the style Miami and these
are from Lilly ghalichi lashes also
known as Lily lashes many MUA actually
introduced me to the whole Lily lashes
range and ever since he used Miami I was
like holy shit that looks incredible
they're not in the packaging because I
always throw the packaging out and never
keep it and the glue that I'm using
today is just a house of lashes clear
lash glue
okay guys moving on to primer I'm just
gonna be taking the Marc Jacobs coconut
primer now the beauty guru who
introduced me to this was Shannon Harris
also known as Shan X oh and she
literally just said that it smells
really good and it literally sucks up
into her skin and moisturizes it which
is kind of what I need my skin's kind of
dry at the moment I have like riah days
and I have oily days it's kind of all
over the place at the beach shitshow to
be honest songs from apartments on my
skin is like sorry sensitive whenever I
rub it or put something on it literally
just goes so red like a tomato for my
foundation today I'm just gonna be
taking the lemare soft fluid along with
foundation now the beauty guru /
youtuber who introduced me to this was
mr. Jeffrey Stewart and he literally
just said that it was one of his
favorite foundations or like use a new
favorite foundation at the time and then
I went out and bought it and I was like
holy shit it smells amazing and it's
very buildable so I'm in the shade
shall 11 so me being me I like to cake
this on to a whole new level so I'm just
gonna like paint it all across my face
and it smells like a luxury like it
smells so good and I really do like this
foundation I wish it was just a little
bit more buildable I think sorry a
little bit more full coverage but I tend
to mix it with other foundations but
today just for the sake of the video I'm
not going to just so you can see and
then it's gonna take my damp Beauty
Blender and start blending this in it
looks like a real skin as well like it
literally looks like you're not really
wearing makeup in my opinion or maybe
it's just got a really nice glow to it
I'm not sure either way I love that I
don't really use this in many videos
just because of the price point it is
literally 200 and I think I paid two
hundred and ten dollars for it so a
little bit cray-cray but that's what you
get when you pay for high-end brands and
then makeup okay guys just finishing off
my concealer I'm just gonna be taking
the top shape tape literally I think I'm
sorry used to the formula of this and
like how it works I don't ever think
this is going to be changed like I'm
gonna use this for the rest of my life
as far as I'm concerned oh just gonna
put under my eyes now I'm ready to go to
town all right so just gonna blend this
with my Beauty Blender as per usual you
guys have literally seen me do this a
million times but I'm going to show you
all again no much just saying you guys
cuz I've literally done this I get
zillion times on my channel ok guys
sorry now to back onto my eyes I'm just
really taking the dermablend
professional setting pattern now Patrick
started using this on his channel and I
was like oh my god and he was like it's
really good so I was like of course I'll
go out and get it because after his
first recommendation which was the Aspen
Powder by car Qi which I have been using
for a very long time now he said this
was amazing when I bought it and it was
and then he said this was amazing so I
went and bought it and it was so he
truly lives up to what he says and I
applaud that literally everything in
this video I really do like also so all
the beauty gurus that I'm talking about
in their recommendations etc etc they're
telling you the truth so I'm just gonna
take that dermablend powder I'm a booty
blender and just baked under my eyes
just in a little triangle shape it's
just so much fucking oh my god this is
almost empty I'm also just gonna pack
out on my nerves too because I tend to
do that all the time average nose listen
powder and I like it to not get oily you
know what I mean
sorry to say the rest of my foundation
I'm gonna take
Cartier's fine powder in the shade
translucent extra coverage and as I was
just talking about before this is the
one that Patrick recommended and I
really really liked it so I'm just gonna
take a big fat brush and I'm gonna just
go over the rest of my face just to
settle the foundation so you can kind of
still see my acne the tiniest little bit
just under here that's why I wish the
lemare foundation was a little bit more
coverage but it's not and it's okay so
just finishing off my eyes I'm just
gonna take this turquoise shade from the
Jaclyn hill looking ass palette and I'm
just gonna take that straight under my
eye blend it right up against my lash
line and kind of blend it down as I car
then I was gonna take the shimmery blue
shade and I'm just gonna pop that right
in my inner corner and I'm just gonna
kind of drag it out over the top of the
other that bit of other blue that I just
put down make sure it's all blended out
I'm just gonna dust off the rest of that
back that's been sitting there moving
onto contouring I'm just going to be
using the Revlon sculpting highlight
contour kit this is in collaboration
with the beautiful Chloe Morello and I
saw her using it I was like holy fuck
need to get it it's drugstore it's not
expensive and it's incredible so I'm
gonna just take this shade right here
and I use this to warm up my skin a
little bit I'm just gonna be taking this
on my morphe r14 dome brush just my
favorite brush for contouring like I
said every fuckin video show if I got
Michael everyone's had enough you shit
your appetitive fucking shit mm-hmm
there's not many product products
product products
there's not many products that I've ever
tried from Revlon this is like the first
one I'm when I first came out I finally
got my hands on it probably like four
months after and it came out because it
was out of stock everywhere which says
that mean
goodnight Tyson love you ok guys so now
that I'm all con to it I'm just going to
add a little bit more just on a
stippling brush and a bow and then I'm
just gonna kind of use it to bronze up
my face ever so slightly so this can be
used for contouring and bronzing which I
love to in one very versatile love that
moving onto blush this is the Tarte
Amazonian clay 12-hour blush this was
recommended by Jacqueline Hill many many
years ago and she basically just said
that they're fucking great because they
do not come off your skin you know how
some blushes tend to wear off during the
day and stuff like that this doesn't and
it literally doesn't move Oh fabulous
this is in the shade blissful so I'm
just gonna add this to my cheeks just a
little bit of blush because I don't like
too much okay so moving on to
highlighter I'm gonna be taking one of
the earth FRA highlighters now I don't
know if you guys can tell but these are
literally my favorite highlighters in
the world I found out about both FRA the
first person I ever saw talked about
over on YouTube was nikkietutorials and
she was talking about that highlighters
and she was like holy fuck do I start
blinding and I'm like huh I mean some so
I got my hands on some and what do you
know they're fucking blinding so today's
shade I'm gonna be using glory goals
which is this really pretty shade right
here I also love the packaging true like
the pattern of the inside it just looks
really like profesh you know what I mean
you know I have the wet look let's see
what I mean refusing a really light hand
guys it's so good like ours for
highlighters I like the bomb diggity
calm and you can just build them and
build them and build them and build them
until you're happy with the way it looks
on your skin I don't think I've really
used this highlighter like this shade
before glow goes from our I think I use
it once but I don't remember being at
this intense holy shit I'm gonna send
y'all to heaven with this nose holla at
me it's I'm gonna add it to my inner
corners as well and my Cupid's bow ok
guys almost last but not least I'm just
gonna go in with some of the touch a
luminous dewy skin miss now this was
introduced to me by Patrick Starr he
just started like going on about this
touch of skincare brand and was saying
how amazing it is something like I can't
either try it so I ended up trying it
literally you touch all the time amongst
a few other things literally obsessed
with them as a brand and this it
literally makes your skin so Julie you
only need a tiny bit otherwise you go
oily so it's even good to wear like when
you're not wearing makeup it just gives
you skin like a nice glowy dewy glow
slow down Michael drink it ahead of his
mouth someone's gonna spritz a little
bit of this on my face just to give me
that chewy look because I am looking
quiet powdery at the moment and it will
accentuate my highlighter a little bit
more not that I need it for my lip color
today I'm just gonna be taking the MAC
lipstick iris said liquid lipstick cuz
I'm so used to using liquids this is the
Oh Laura Lee collaboration and when I
was sent this in PR I was like holy fuck
I haven't used and like I'd like a
regular lipstick for so long and then I
put it on and I'm like holy shit this is
the most perfect nude color ever
and this is what the lipstick looks like
it's literally the most perfect nude
color and a lot of people also ask me
why I don't use lip liner well because
when I drew because my lips are so
fucking you know injected when I do use
the planner they just look out of this
world
clown true fucking big so I tend to stay
away from a lip liner anyway guys this
is the completed and finished look I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you wanna see more videos like this
or more full face challenges make sure
you give this video a thumbs up so I
know oh sorry everybody that I mentioned
