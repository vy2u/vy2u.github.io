channel so today's video is going to be
a full glam tutorial using super super
cheap makeup so basically the whole
video is going to be using all two three
products now if you're in Australia I'm
not sure if they're seldom in America I
think it's just more of a Australian
base sort of makeup brand but it's quite
cheap you can get it in like the
chemists and stuff like that so yeah I'm
just going to be using that for my whole
entire face so let's see how we go so
the first thing I'm going to be using is
this ultra three eyebrow kit so I'm just
going to take a little bit of the light
sort of a brown shade from this kit and
I'm just going to go in on my brows I
actually just got my eyebrows tinted as
well so they're a bit thicker than
normal well actually let's do rather
probably not yeah so far so good so I'm
just going to finish filling them in
just with the darker powder towards the
end and I'm using the lighter powder
towards the front as like a white thing
in there like a gel or something but I'm
not using there I'm just going to use
the powders because I feel like that
works best for me now because this is a
full glam look I am going to be using a
concealer to carve out my brows a little
bit more so just taking the lighter
shade from this concealer little joy
here seems quite thick which is good so
I'm just kind of bringing that
underneath my brow and just cleaning up
like that whole complete line down now
I'm going to take a bit more of that
concealer and just conceal the tops of
the brows still is actually pretty good
it's got really good on my coverage
you'll see how berries under the eyes
after hey I'm just kind of blending out
that harsh lighter side of my brow just
so there's no harshness and I did
actually cut my eyebrow in here the
other day while tweezing it I'm just
going to cover up that dot right blemish
 now let's do eyes shadow this
is the eye shadow palette that I'm using
today what I'm going to do before
starting the eye shadow I'm just going
to drag that concealer all over my
eyelid area just so we have a really
good base for our shadows okay now I'm
going to taking my damp Beauty blender
and blend up killer power and then just
gonna take this pressed powder here and
just set my mileage just before that
gets a chance to crease could be done
with that happening at all so I'm just
setting all of that concealer what this
pad is probably a bit dark to say you
can seal it so we have a nice transition
color already happening in there which
is totally fine by me okay moving on to
the eyes let's go back to this eye
shadow color that I showed you guys
before and we're going to be doing I
don't really know what we're going to be
doing I'm just gonna actually instead of
going straight in with the eye shadow
palette I'm just going to take this big
bronzer here just on this the fluffy
blending brush I'm just going to take
some of that bronzer and just put it
through the outer crease and I'm going
to start winging that out so I'm kind of
flicking that out as we go so this
bronzer is quite like warm tone which is
kind of good because you know I love a
good warm trend bronzer so after that
and then just going to go straight back
in with our eye shadow palette and I'm
just going to be taking this darker
brown color just here just pop on the
outer V of my eye and I'm kind of gonna
just bring that across like that it
doesn't matter how chunky or messy look
fine because we're going to blend it out
anyway which is generally what you do
you know
Oh as an actual fire in my tongue sorry
if you can hear that fire alarm guys but
I'm just plopping that on the outer V
and kind of bringing it up for the
crease area a couple of just fires
already apparently gonna be one of the
worst times for Australia this year so
let's hope we don't get anything like
Ash Wednesday or Black Saturday because
that is just scary as hate flies
sorry magic but if there's anything I
hate the most
it's fire and water like drowning and
stuff like that it's just well
pipes don't really bother me I have to
like okay but when it comes to that it's
not anything now I'm just going to take
a little bit of that black out of the
eyeshadow palette just to deepen up
there out of be a little bit more and
I'm just going to plop that straight on
there okay after I've got all that black
on the outer V I kind of wanna put some
of my eyelid I'm just gonna box maybe I
might take this a shimmery sort of
colour here oh yeah the colour payoff is
actually really good I didn't even put
any fix+ on so I'm just putting a
generous amount of the color on my lid
area now just taking this black felt tip
eyeliner I'm just going to be doing a
wing on my eye so I'm just going to
focus it from the outer v flick it out
and then join up that up again and then
I'm going to be doing that across my
whole eyelid because I think they're
looking pretty good for mascara this is
the volume and lengthening mascara I'm
just gonna chuck it up on my lashes
oh I'm just gonna coat my top lashes in
this we're gonna be doing the bottoms
afterwards now because older three
currently does not have any eyelashes
I'm just going to throw some lashes on
and I will be right back now that I have
stuck my lashes on let's move on to the
actual skin I want full coverage I want
a full coverage first I'm going to be
going in with this ready to glow primer
and I'm just going to take some of that
on my hands what decides to come out
ah there we go huh mmm success stunning
this is the perfect balance foundation
in the shade ivory because I'm not tired
at the moment and I'm also going to be
trying out these brushes by a brand
called tbx there but like magnetic
handles so they're meant to all stick
together how weird is that and they're
like hang Oh
so I does I take it that foundation
brush from tbx little magnetic organ
things and I'm gonna take some of that
foundation and I'm gonna start taking
that on this looks like it's the right
color which is just what we need now
just taking my damp Beauty Blender I'm
just going to start blending that out
but I would say this foundation is
medium to full coverage I feel like it's
very loose is that the right word to use
I feel like it's very watery in a way
but it still got you know decent amount
of coverage to I feel like if you were
just Wyatt it would move until you set
it obviously that's like generally with
most foundations breath lips is very
watery which isn't a bad thing it's
going to take a bit more of that
foundation on my hand and I was going to
put something across my forehead to get
this part all covered ah now I have
already concealed the tops of my
eyebrows I want you to worry about that
see now just going back in with my
concealer duo I'm just gonna take a
ton of that concealer and I'm gonna be
putting up on my nose on my chin around
my nose on my forehead
those concealers actually got really
good coverage up just like concealer
everything now just taking that a light
concealer again straight underneath my
eyes
now straight looking with my damp Beauty
Blender again and I'm just going to
start blending that concealer right now
now because older tree does not have a
translucent powder as of yet a loose one
I'm just going to take some translucent
powder and distinctly Bank on my under
eyes now to set the rest of my
foundation I'm going to go back into
this powder on one of these brushes just
set that and I'm just going to be
putting a German neck as it is a little
bit too dark for me you know how I do I
always make it work in the end now just
taking this story Bink it I'm just going
to start highlighting and contouring a
little bit so taking this shade just
here I just on this magnetic brush again
I'm just going to slightly warm up the
outer perimeter of my face and kind of
do a bit of a contour now for my under
eyes today or my waterline I'm swimmy
taking this black eyeliner pencil and
I'm just going to be popping that into
my waterline now just going back into
the eyeshadow palette that I use
previously I'm just going to be taking
the dark brown shade out of that and
kind of just smoking out my lower lash
line a bit
so I've just wanted to go real smokey on
this lower lash line the card that I
thought was Brown it's actually got like
a purple maroon tinge to it so as I'm
smoking it down it's getting lighter and
lighter the more I'm blending it it's
going it like a dark surfer ball I'm
kind of living for it now I'm just going
to sweep that bake that I've got
underneath my eyes I'm just going to get
rid of that I'm kind of just going to be
going back in with this dark pressed
powder and just kinda this is like in
the shade champagne so it's I think it's
like one of the darkest ones and I'm
kind of just contouring around my
jawline well I'm making a jawline mm-hmm
around my temples and my forehead of
course any single type of opportunity I
get to condense this forehead down I
take it now for my blush I'm just going
to go back into the strobing kit and I'm
just going to take a combo of these two
colors here Jenna how pigmented they are
oh you're nice I hate blushes that are
too pigmented
you can go zero to 100 or 100 to zero
real quick isn't that true and now it's
a highlight I'm just going to take this
color right here bad guys not bad at all
bring it up around my eyebrow I would
have a gleam when I change the side you
know that Cupid's bow I'm also just
going to be taking a little bit of that
highlighter shade I'm just going to
popping that it's going to be popping
that on the inner corners of my eyes to
make them a little bit more open just
because we've closed them up so much
with this smokiness we need to give it a
bit more of a pop now for my lipstick
today I'm going to be using this long
way lip cream in the shade
hunter/gatherer I believe that's how you
say it
I'm gonna go for something a little bit
more full appropriate a little bit more
dark rather than nude cuz I always do
nude dark lips kind of scare me but at
the same time that kind of gosh so
super pigmented so I've just put about
two layers of this on and it's pretty
full coverage after two layers and it
feels quite moisturizing as well okay
guys this brings us to the end of
today's tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed
this if you did don't forget to give me
a massive thumbs up I love you guys so
much and I will see you all in my next
video bye so Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
