channel oh my god it is so good to be
back
filming sitting down if you guys don't
follow me on my other social media it
will be linked down below sales primary
but I have been sick for about a week
now and I'm still a little bit sick at
the moment you might be able to hear it
in my voice but other than that I'm back
and I'm ready to film again so I have
some awesome videos planned for you guys
and today I want to do a full face using
the best drugstore products now these
types of products are pretty much
available all of them in Australia there
isn't much like you know Milani or
wet-and-wild or anything in here it's
pretty much all available in Australia
so for my American viewers and whatnot
if you guys want me to do a full face
using a drugstore makeup from overseas
leave me a comment down below and I'll
be sure to do that as well
without any further review let's get
straight into this video
okay so starting off with primer today
I'm going to be taking the L'Oreal Lumi
magique base now this is stunning now
you guys haven't actually seen me use
this in literally any videos because I
don't think of use it in videos before
but I have used it off-camera and guys
it is literally almost the same to the
back our back light primer it's so
pretty it gives a really nice glow on
the skin and it's super super pigmented
you'll see what I mean in a minute looks
like this and like just already look at
that below and it smells like shit but
it makes your skin look so glowy and
beautiful I mean like it's not going to
shine through by the end of it because
of all the foundations and I pack on but
that is not a problem but like it just
gives them as you know tacky sort of
base to the skin the next thing I'm
going in with is the baby skin primer
from Maybelline this is just going to
fill in my pores a little bit which is
what the other primer did not do so I'm
just going to be putting this over my
t-zone area and it's going to blow my
pores and like fill in under my eyes a
little bit like up in here my skin's
looking so good lately I don't know why
I think it's because that means they're
going to haven't been putting makeup on
and I've been giving it a break now this
is literally at first but today I'm
actually going to be doing my skin first
shock because the reason why I'm doing
skin first is because I do not have an
eyeshadow palette that I think is worthy
of putting in this video I have not
found a drugstore eyeshadow palette that
I'm absolutely in love with that I'm
just going to put in the video for the
sake of the video I'm not going to do
that so I'm going to be skipping
eyeshadow today and I'm also kind of
also going to be skipping lashes because
I just don't have any you know what I
mean it's like I was in past line
yesterday and I was looking at all the
lashes and I just didn't think to buy
some because I'm a fucking idiot let's
move on to foundation so my favorite
drugstore foundation is the l'oreal
infallible 24-hour matte this is in the
shade 13 rose beige it's got a pink
undertone to it so it's perfect for my
skin might be a little bit dark but I'm
going to make it work squeeze some of
that onto the back of my tongue
okay then I'm just going to start
applying this all over my face just a
little you know a little strokes up in
here now the reason why I'm making this
video is because I know that
a lot of young girls out there who do
watch my videos and they do want a bit
of help with um customer passing about
not a problem they do want help with
like what drugstore products the best so
um this is the reason why I make these
videos because they look helping people
and I like inspiring people and I just
overall love making YouTube videos I'm
going to take my Real Techniques damp
Beauty sponge and I'm just going to dip
into a little bit of us and did Legation
and then I'm going to go straight on in
and start blending all this foundation
now I feel like this is such a weird
video because I've got to do my eyebrows
I don't know how I selection my eyebrows
I think I'm a little bit sick I'm still
a little bit all over the place do you
know what I mean but normally I do my
eyes first this is like this is the rare
occasion hunt that just blends out so
nicely and it is 100% full coverage and
it lasts and it does stain matte so it
lives up to its name
I'm so glad to be like back and filming
and talking to you guys again I've
missed doing this sorry March YouTube is
literally like a huge part of my life
now and I could not live without it or
you guys of course okay guys now that my
foundation is all time I'm going to be
moving on to concealer and today I'm
going to be using the Maybelline anti
age rewind concealer now I have been a
fan of this concealer for so long and I
actually just refound this in my big
massive makeup like box
stashed bullshit that like isn't so that
I found it's literally right at the
bottom when I was sorting shit out the
other day and this is in the shade light
pale so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to go straight on here I have not
used this in so long
I'm telling you right now it is the
fullest coverage drugstore concealer
from Australia that I've ever used in my
life
look it blends look just watch it blend
out like your diet amazing another
reason why I'm making this video is
because if you are looking for some new
drugstore products or like if you want
to you know start getting into makeup or
something like that
and you don't know where to start this
video will help you because these are
the products that I highly recommend I
think they have the best formulas
nothing in this video is sponsored just
putting that out there like this is not
paid or anything like that this is my
honest
opinion about these fucking amazing
drugstore products and I got to them
every day in my life now I'm just going
to be putting some underneath my eyes as
well this is so weird how I haven't done
my eyeshadow so weird I'm going to do a
little bit on top as well to prep for
our non-existent eyeshadow
okay just taking my sponge again and I'm
just going to blend this out look it's
so the coverage is amazing like what
like what more do you want
okay guys now to bake all of my
concealer so it does not move in a
staging place all throughout the day I'm
going to be taking the dermablend
professional setting powder now I've
seen a lot of people on YouTube say that
this has flashback I mean what like I
have never witnessed flashback using
this power ever if you knock the product
like after you bake if you knock all
that makeup off properly and blend like
a little bit of foundation powder over
you won't have any flashback so I don't
know where people are getting that from
but I love it that's their opinion
they're allowed to have that but I don't
think it has flashback at all it might
have a tiny little bit but I lack that
look because it brightens up underneath
your eyes but it's not like it's a full
like white cast like white lines or
anything like that okay so before I set
that I'm just going to make sure all my
concealer is blended out and there are
no harsh lines okay then I was going to
dip straight in and I'm just going to
start packing this product straight
underneath how did you hear that see
this is still a little bit of sickness
in my voice gross then I'm just kind of
bouncing over it and like really
pressing it in okay guys so once I have
baked underneath my eyes and it's all
set and I'm kind of like press two all
in and dust it all off already I'm going
to then move on to setting your SMI
foundation now an awesome foundation
powder that I have lived for for so many
years is the Australis fresh and
flawless pressed powder this is in the
shade light beige and Italia it is
literally amazing so I was going to take
that out on my brush and I'm just going
to start pressing that all over my face
and really setting that foundation so it
lasts all throughout the day a lot of
people always tell me that this is a
dupe for the Mac the Mac foundation
powder I think it's better to be honest
I'm such a huge fan of this product and
some products that the stylist comes out
with are just like amazing like they're
so good so once that's all set let's
move on to let's just get my eyebrows
done because
I really hate doing my eyebrows for my
eyebrows today I'm going to be using the
elf eyebrow kit this basically has a gel
in it and a powder also so I'm just
going to take a little bit of the gel
and what I like to do is I kind of like
to extend the end of my eyebrow so it's
a little bit more like longer I guess
then I'm going to take a little bit of
that gel like compact in here I'm just
going to add it onto the end of my brow
just like that and then I'm kind of just
going to like brush it through the rest
of my brows just so the powder that I
put on over like over the top
afterwards it has something to stick to
once that gel is all through my brows
and then just going to take the powder
side and I'm just going to go over that
and kind of just run it through my brows
so really matter
not a problem bending okay there we go
so it's nothing too extreme it's just
kind of keeping them like in their
natural sort of shape okay guys now to
finish off my eyebrows I'm going to be
taking the Australis tint my brow this
is in the shade of light brown so what
this does is it basically just tends to
your eyebrow hairs it's kind of like one
of those extra things to do but in all
honesty it's I feel like it's a really
good thing to do because it really does
help your brows look more full and like
more like you know looks like you put
more effort into your brows and then
just set my brows in place all day I'm
going to be taking the Australis lash
and brow
clear stuff I don't really know what it
is but what it does is it sets your
brows in place so when you brush them up
into place like this it literally sets
them all day and it doesn't just
aspirate in your eyebrows so they don't
move do you know what I mean so if you
love those really like defined brows or
you love your hairs on your eyebrows
sticking up really cly then this is
going to help with that whole process
because that's what it does okay moving
back onto the face I'm going to be
taking the Physicians Formula butter
bronzer now I have my muses in edit
videos either I just bought it the other
day for this video but I have used it
off-camera a lot and honestly Physicians
Formula I feel like it's one of those
brands that a lot of people don't really
talk about much like a few of my friends
story in their videos and like they use
their products but I feel like it's not
talked about enough and honestly it
smells that fucking good I don't know
what it smells like that it just smells
like coconut home I got a coconut so I'm
just going to dip my brush into zebra
ha and I'm just going to start you know
starting to warm up my whole face oh my
god I thought I'd get this brush a
second go I used to love this brush so
much so much
it's the morphe r7 but I was using it
the other day and I was wearing a black
shirt and literally there was just a
brush you know head all over my shirt I
was like what the fuck and it's from
morphe to scan just morphe exposed and
this bronzer is honestly like so
stunning the way it packs onto the skin
the way it blends and I think you can
get this for I think this was $30 2995
but if you get it they sell it in
Priceline so if you get it in Priceline
when they have one of those like 40% of
all cosmetics it comes down to like I
don't know like $15 or something but I
highly recommend it almost always out of
stock everywhere too because people
obviously love it I was lucky enough to
snatch one the other day now because we
are giving eyeshadow today I'm take a
little bit of a bronzer and what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to pop it
really really close you know and just
kind of warm up my eyelid area a little
bit just so we have something going on
up in there you know what I mean okay
guys moving on to a little bit more
contouring I'm going to be taking the
elf contour palette now you guys you're
probably thinking elf
contour up honestly no formula goodbye I
have raised about this before and saw it
many videos I am obsessed with this this
is the shade I use right here this is
just in the style assorted I guess so
there's a few different things in here I
haven't really touched on that this one
or these three just more so I do some
because I feel like this is perfect for
my skin tone so I'm just going to take
that and I'm just going to further
contour a little bit more it's so good
you guys like if you can ever get your
hands on this and you want like a like
drugstore relative to a contour palette
that's good
this is where I start now for my blush
today I'm going to be taking the once
again elf blush palette these blushes
are that good you don't go and spend you
know sixty dollars on fucking NARS
orgasm or deep throat you can just go
and get this because it works just as
good so today I'm going to be taking
this shade just
here it's kind of like a I don't even
know how to explain that so i'ma just
use it and not so much more tap off the
excess chip that you don't need not our
problem and I'm just going to start
applying this on my cheeks see how it
just gives like that nice flush of color
just like a little bit like but like
still good like what any other blush can
pretty much do now before I move on to

face with a bit of the Rimmel insta-fix

kind of set my whole face and then dive

shows up a little bit better whoo so for
my highlighter today I'm going to be

today I'm just going to be taking the
elf I don't even know what this is to be
