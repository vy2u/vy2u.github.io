today is going to be a voice over did
you like that so let's get started and
first of all I'm going to be taking a
mac fix+ just spritzing my face with
that to make it a little bit more less
jewy then I'm going to be taking the UH
Nastasia beverly hills dipbrow pomade in
chocolate and blonde mixing them
together and just doing my brows how I
would normally do them so I'm just
basically filling them in and I look
there's me haven't probably having a
bitch about someone on the phone
surprise surprise um see I'm just
filling those babies in and then I'll be
going in with a concealer this is a NARS
concealer and just cleaning up
underneath that and I'm bringing that
all the way down to my eyelid to use as
a base for all of my shadows cleaning
that up there you know just cleaning her
rudder up and then I'm using the
benefits new primer awesome it's great
just on a kabuki not a kabuki it's a
long brush this sort of brush shots from
make up weapons it's really really good
and just buffing that all into my skin
that are moving on to foundation this is
a type Amazonian clay yes I'm so
surprised this will have some bliss left
after what happened a few weeks ago
spritzing my dirty-ass Beauty Blender
with that and basically just putting
that all over my face as you can see and
I'm actually concealing the tops of my
brows with that foundation because it's
such high coverage I don't really need
to use a concealer and I think there was
a little bit left on there too so that
just kind of helps the whole situation
out a little bit there we go boom
so now I'm just taking the NARS
concealer once again under my eyes on my
nose bridge on my chin and my Cupid's
bow and my forehead
just cuz the foundation I used is quite
dark when you put that concealer on it
just helps bring some light back to your
face and then I was going to be blending
that out with my dirty ass looking at
beautiful Enda and making some horrible
faces that I normally cut out of my
videos but I thought why not in this
video I even do my waterline on camera
and my mouth looks like a dick is about
to enter it then I'm just then I'm just
baking my face with the Cody Aspen
powder and I'm putting heaps and heaps
on because like you guys know I never do
my face first ever simply because of the
fallout but I'm doing at this time
you'll see why because the eye shadow is
going all the way out to my hairline so
I'm just taking an orange
shadow and blending it all the way out
to my hairline and just kind of creating
like a wing shape on the eye kind of
like a wing shape I don't know if it's a
wing shape but it looks like one to me
so I'm just sweeping that out and I
probably put a lot of this on probably
didn't eat it because I'm covering quite
a bit of it up with other eye shadows
but it's good to have a lot of powder
there just so your shadows blend a lot
better now I'm just going in with like a
darker sort of reddish Marone sort of
eye shadow just to darken up the crease
area a little bit before I go in with
black because I'm going to darken up
everything with black but before doing
that I'm kind of laying down this over
the transition which was the orange and
then I'm just sweeping that all the way
out of my hairline literally sleeping at
the out so I'm just bringing that
all the way into my hooded eyelid so you
can see it so I'm bringing above so you
can see and then I'm going in with the
black eye shadow and put as much as you
want on I mean seriously you can't go
wrong with black eye shadow or you can
there are limits but with this look
there's not because it's a festival you
can just go all out there you know you
can just spread it all over your whole
bloody eyelid if you need to so I'm just
putting that underneath my lower lash
line as well so I'm basically just
blending that black all the way down and
then I'm also going with a little bit
more orange because I kind of lost a lot
of it there with blending you know how I
shadows we blend it and you lose a bit
of the color underneath I don't know it
looks really really intense right now
but it'll be fine then I'm taking the
two-faced glitter glue and putting that
all over my lid and just putting that
all over my lid ready for the pigment
because I want it to be so so intense
people that I'm using is called copper
sparkle by Mac this is a tester that
I've had for about probably about five
and a half years now and I just haven't
really got around to using it and I'm
obsessed with it
I love it it looks so good Mac pigments
and glitters are honestly the best ones
out there on the market that I've tried
so far I really want to try the violet
vos ones is it the glitter injections I
don't know whatever then I'm sweeping
away that bake because all the eyeshadow
is done then I'm just going back with
the orange shade just to bring it back
underneath a little bit more because we
lost a bit of that then I'm just gonna
be bronzing up my face with give me Sun
by Mac so I'm kind of laying that down
as a base ready for the contour
the more powder you put down the easier
it is to blend out and it's less
likely to go muddy so I'm just blending
that out you know then I'm just
contouring to absolute living out
of my nose I cut a lot of this out for
the girls for a long time taking a long
time to contour this big-ass nose then
I'm just going into some light powder
along the sides to kind of pinch it
together just trying out you know just
trying out some new things and it seemed
to work for me you know probably went a
little bit intense but it looks a good
on camera so well I think it does we can
go with that
then I am contouring the absolute
out of my face using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills contour kit and yeah then
I'm just going in with a black eyeshadow
along my lash line because I'm not gonna
be doing wings or liquid liner so I'm
just smudging black into my lash line so
the eyelashes blend better and as I said
earlier state I'm tight lining my eyes
while I'm trying to sit up yeah oh not
all good how Grange my eyes look right
now I'm loving it then I'm just doing
mascara this is great for bottom lashes
it's really good for top lashes as well
these lashes that I'm using are
incredible they were nice enough to send
them to me I'll leave them on the screen
what they are Nia and the style so I'm
just plunking them on my beautiful
little coppery sparkly eyelids to make
them look all sassy and and
discussing they are yeah
looks great fabulous fabulous then I'm
just blending a little bit of mascara
onto them because a little bit of powder
to get onto my lashes don't know how but
it did but I'm just taking two different
types of lashes from makeup geek I'll
leave them on the screen or what they
are also all the products they use will
be down in the description below if you
missed any they'll be there go have a
look then for my highlight today I'm
using Becca champagne pop which is
amazing you know it pops severely and I
think I put a little bit of fix+ on my
brush as well just to make it a little
bit more intense I'm putting that on the
high point to my face keep its bird nose
nose bridge under my what's called just
a little bit on my chin I mean you know
I'm getting used to this work so
everything on a little bit on the inner
corner of my eyes as well but like it
spices up now for my lips I didn't feel
much of this because it was way out of
frame but I used celebrity skin by
Geoffrey Star first then I went over
with a bit of I'm nude from Jeffrey star
and then I use this
I see lipliner from pop cosmetic and
yeah then I'm taking a Jeffrey Starr's
drug lord a liquid lipstick and just
doing some dots on my face at the end
and a sassy little makeup brush and it
worked out very very well and I'm very
happy with our look so that's pretty
much the end of the video guys I hope
you enjoyed it if you did give it a
thumbs up and I'll see you all in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
