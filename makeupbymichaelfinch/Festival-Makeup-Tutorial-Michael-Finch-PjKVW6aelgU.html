today I'm gonna be doing like a festival
inspired tutorial I'm using a lot of
different pinks like glitter a lot of
glam a lot of everything
sorry I'm just starting off with my
eyebrows first I'm just speeding through
this as I'm yet still do a tutorial if
you guys still want to say that would a
double or if you do cuz I'm learning you
something just taking some a brow shadow
and just blending through my eyebrow
filling in all the little gaps that I
missed
now for concealer today of course what
else would I be using the Born This Way
concealer in the shade light neutral and
I'm just coming at the bottom of my
brows with that and then just taking it
some more that concealer over the top of
my eyelid to use as an eye base and
blending that out with mag damp Beauty
Blender and then I'm going straight in
with some setting powder just to set
that before it gets a chance to cruise
now for my eyeshadow I'm dipping into
the modern renaissance on the stuffier i
shadow palette I'm kind of all over the
place today because I feel like I'm
getting sick and I'm not uh anyway I'm
just blending that through my cruisers
and just letting that for just getting a
bit of a transition going on you know
that I'm dipping into the shade love
letter which is like a darker pink and I
want to start defining my crease with
that I can't gonna stop doing that like
just seriously it's just embarrassing
and I'm just blending up from just
speeding this up because this kind of is
a long tutorial so I kind of want to get
through it without boring you guys too
much now I'm just taking the Geoffrey
start Beauty killer palette I'm taking
star power which is the pink shade and I
just kind of put this through my crease
as well I don't know why I didn't really
do much but I was just experimenting
okay then started by this guy's this
whole tutorial is a mess when it comes
to the eyeshadow because music like
seven different palettes they're like
three but for this part I'm just taking
the money anyway makeup geek palette and
I'm taking the light sort of ready shade
and then the darkest sort of Brown a
maroon shade just to define the crease a
little bit more and I'm just packing
that on and blending it out as I go then
to highlight my brow bone today I'm just
you
Jeffrey Stehr China white Appleby
tequila palette just you know spice up
that area and just there now for my lip
color today I'm just taking princess
from the beauty killer palette as well
and I believe I did spray my brush with
a little bit of mac fix+ as well
just to your help of pigmentation of
that shirt up a little bit better now
this I'm gonna be a big opener what the
 did I just say I'm using this
glitter from our faith of lashes this
it's a priceless so you don't need to
glue that so I didn't use a glue and it
doesn't crease and it just goes straight
on like this is amazing I'll leave
everything that I use down below sort of
colors and everything so you guys know
I'm talking while I was putting that all
over my eyelid area and it's going on so
smoothly I'm loving it now I put this
pin in but I did make a mistake this is
the true face white eyeliner and I'm
putting this in because which will be
our mistakes and it didn't work across
the eyelid cuz the glitter was getting
in the way so I just let him win in I
just went in with Geoffrey stars drug
lord and that was a lot more opaque then
I'm just doing a tiny little thin ass
line the thinnest asked line that you
can get I sell my Taylor motor then ass
ass ass across my lash line just sorry
my lashes have something to blend into a
little bit easier now I'm just taking a
clean and makeup wipe obviously we'll be
taking in to anyone and just cleaning up
the edge of that now moving on to the
face I'm just using the Too Faced let's
say better than dick mustard and this is
the hangover prime I like now all over
my face rubbing that into all my paws
and this primer is more of one for
people with drier skin I would say then
I'm just going in with the hourglass
foundation stick and just applying that
all over my face it's a little bit
darker because I am matching a cheerier
of my neck obviously so I'm just
blending that out with a morphe brush I
don't know what this brush is cool it'll
be on the screen right now I really like
using a brush to blend this foundation
out because it's quite thick but then of
course I just got over with my damp
Beauty Blender afterwards
sorry as you can see now I'm just going
straight over that with my damp Beauty
Blender just to make sure everything is
seamless and smooth now concealer she
face blonde this way well off my veins
real talk and miss applying my whole
applying
I'm filing my entire face with that and
especially under my eyes and then I will
just be eventually taking my Beauty
Blender again and blending there we go
blending that out well with Northland
fameless' I've been trying to test you
out like ways to blend out my concealer
but I figured that the best way to do it
is you Beauty blend off it's just
seamless it lays the right amount of
product on the skin it's so except the
excess excess shipping you don't need
guys it's just really good if you don't
have everybody you need to get one my
side there is a difference between
Arabian maybe but I can't say okay I
can't talk like I literally cannot talk
I don't know what it is but I'm stressed
out I'm not really stressed out I'm just
like a mess today um then I'm just
taking the awesome and I call it powder
I lost my voice I was I'm like no common
factor wing it again so I just biked
underneath my eyes now I'm studying the
rest of my face with the estrela's fresh
and flawless I believe it was in the
shade deep natural which is the one that
I always use and just patting that all
over my face down all my Chin's now for
bronze I'm using this new are the from
hot makeup this is a really nice brown
guy it's a matte bronzer and I really
enjoyed you think it was quite nice yeah
I'm just applying that all over my face
my forehead my cheekbone and china make
myself look a little bit skinnier my jaw
will try to create a jaw then I'm just
taking the Australis banana powder and
putting that on my nose and a little bit
on my forehead I soon going in that with
somewhere that just next to my eyes
after I've done my under eyes with eye
shadow and dust it away all that baked
basically what I'm doing underneath my
eyes is exactly the same one I did on
top so I'm just taking in the transition
the whatever and I'm is going from
darkest to my lower left to my lower
lashline and then I'm just like fading
that out so lightest like do you remain
like transitioning from like radiance
mic dr. Lai that makes sense I don't
know what colors in order I went in I
just kind of did
and hope for the best but I know the car
I'm using right now is the hot pink from
the jeffree star palette to like blend
everything out so now my favorite this
is the Too Faced better than dick
mascara I love this mascara so much
lashes are Lily lashes in the style of
Monaco and I wanted lashes that like
didn't cover up the white eyeliner but
still will act long for my bottom lashes
I'm just using Mac extended play and as
I said before i'm going in with that
stylist banana powder again and knocking
off that bake at the same time now I
felt like I just needed a little bit
more contouring like I wasn't too harsh
with the contouring on this because I
wasn't cuz I'm gonna highlight to the
gods you wait for it so I'm just using
hoola and just contouring a little bit
more with that morphe brush that I got
there now for highlighter this is artist
Couture in the shade yeah but it's like
a pink
it's got like reflex of pink in it so I
thought it was perfect for this tutorial
they wanted to use this for a long time
and I finally got the chance to do it
and I mean and it speaks for itself
pretty much check it out off girl you
know what it is so I'm just blending
that all over much I'm bringing it down
lower than I normally should Adam doing
my nose bridge my Cupid's bow and then
to make it a little bit more pink I'm
just taking this blush from japanesse
and applying that on my cheekbones Clare
felt like that just like it made this
look sorry much better like the color
then I'm just using the lip cosmetics
glia glitter adhesive and I'm just using
these loose glitters from glitter
injections and applying it under my eyes
just felt like this made the whole book
so much better like you can go to a
festival without glitter on their face
not that I've been to a festival because
honestly I don't think that would be for
me but I love doing the makeup for it
and yeah I love what I've come up with
today for you guys I'm just putting a
little bit more of that glitter I'm
using two different clothes by the way
they'll be down below I just put a
little bit more on the inner corner of
my eyes just so like whatever this
lipstick is from Melly cosmetics
I'm just applying that all over my lips
like a baby pink then I'm just going
over it with art froze lipstick this was
like a really Sheen lipstick I like the
shade down below and then I just went
over my lips with a little bit of that I
was could show a Jones
eyeliner just like I light them up a
little bit and yeah and then I'm just
sitting all my face with the Ofra makeup
accessories pray so I hope you guys
