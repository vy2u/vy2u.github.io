hello guys welcome back to my channel so
today I decided to do a festival makeup
tutorial using only Australian drugstore
brands now I know a lot of my following
is from Australia I think the highest
demands from Australia used to be us two
kind of fluctuates between the two but
at the moment it's Australia so I
thought I would do a full face using
Australian drugstore brand finally so
stuff you can pretty much get everything
here in Priceline or Kmart
or anything like that and it's gonna be
a colorful lookbook what's inspired me
to do this is I got these two palettes
the other day in PR these are both from
astralis this is called the kaleidoscope
eyeshadow palette and it's like looks
like that and I swatch it on my hand
before and I was a little bit shook
sorry umm yeah let's see how this guards
heart flicker as well swatches act a
little bit differently so on the eyes
but we're gonna find out if you guys
enjoyed this video make sure you give it
a massive thumbs up and let's get into
it let go okay so starting off with my
brows first I'm gonna be using the Raa
brow from a stralla this is the brow
shaping kit and this is in the shade
don't know because it doesn't say it up
so I'm just going to be going in with
the gel part first just kind of like add
some more length to the end of my brows
now I kind of want my brows to look kind
of like bushy and feathery generic
thoughts gonna happen but we'll say now
I'm just gonna take this powder here
from the middle and just kind of fill
them
kind of dislike that I was gonna brush
the hairs I'm trying to keep them
looking like our natural ish if I can
try and avoid that whole Instagram
bralet infinionite - okay so I pretty
much just filled these and I'm gonna go
back in afterwards and set them with
some brow gel to keep them all the way
off but I like to do that after I've
done foundation just because I like to
do it like that yeah moving on to
conceal arms going to be taking the
Maybelline master conceal I love this
concealer like it better than the fitnah
one it's just so good just gonna squirt
a little bit onto the back of my mirror
down there just because I don't want to
use my hand today so now this one is in
the shade I'm not so sure a light
20 light no worries ton so I'm just
gonna use this to carve out my brow
it calls out the browser nicely because
it's kind of like a thick consistency
now I'm just gonna take more of that
conceal all down onto my lid area guys
know the drill how this car is just
covering everything else up to prep for
a nice eyeshadow base dill dill dill
stop chop just gonna blend this oh gosh
see how like good the coverage is and
it's like a nice it looks nice so take a
little bit of the Australis fresh and
flawless and just set my lid now dipping
into the stars are sharmee to be moving
on to the eyes now I'm gonna be using
this kaleidoscope palette from a stylist
like I said at the beginning no it's not
sponsored I just got really excited to
use this work on our open it's gonna
literally cut open it okay select pinks
and purples oh my god nerd you know and
I want to get in spray from Holly Boone
where's my phone
Holly brand did this amazing festival
look the other day you don't follow her
I'll leave her links Tumblr she is
incredible at makeup I'm gonna get some
inspired from this photo of Holly Oh
double tap there we go so we're gonna do
like pinks and purples on top and then
like a blue underneath I really hope
this palette works out for me because
I'm excited to use it especially I'm
gonna go images like this pinky like red
sort of color I'm gonna stop by
the pigments definitely bad so you guys
I'm dying I'm gonna zoom you in the
pigmentation and the way this is
blending out for astralis like I'm very
very impressed so I'm just gonna work
slowly and I'm gonna start bringing it
out and like up towards my brow I'm
gonna eventually start bringing up right
into my inner corner because I'm gonna
be doing like that cut crease sort of
look like Holly's done so impressed with
this eye shadow I heard all the colors I
like this pigmented it's gonna take on
more denser brush but still using the
same color and see if I can build it up
a little bit more okay going into the
next color I'm gonna be taking just a
pinky shade right here and I'm gonna see
if this is gonna deepen it up a little
bit maybe we'll guess you'll have to
watch to find out so I didn't do too
much but I'm gonna add some of this
purple shade here huh just to be out of
ha this is like a shimmery shade so it's
a bit of a different consistency from
like the other ones the other Matt's
that I just put down my god that
actually looks sorry like good I'm
impressed
I'm going back to that brush from before
and just blend over the edges of the
poor now I feel like it's totally
necessary just to add a little bit of
black so I'm sort of going into this
pellet from Australis this is the
neutralizer eyeshadow palette I'm going
to take the black out of here
a little bit just gonna take a little
bit more purple and just blend over that
black okay holy Australis
you've done well del I'm just gonna
quickly drew this slide what I've done
them to sign then I'll come back and
we'll do the lid
okay I'm back so my other eyes now Don
and I just had a little bit of fall out
just a bit I'm just gonna go just gonna
grab my needle like this okay moving on
to we're gonna do like the race
sort of thing kind of like a race
some take the mop and better be people
whether you got cool gonna take the
Maybelline master conceal just on this
little flat top brush and I'm just gonna
do what I always do
okay now that I've got that kind of
going there I'm gonna blend it a little
bit now from the kaleidoscope palette
I'm gonna take this really shimmery
shade here and I'm gonna pack this all
over the lid now it is quite chunky okay
so I'm just kind of blending that out on
the outer edge now that that can see a
lot is all nice and set go back in with
the brush I was using before and a
little bit of the purple just to kind of
blend into the edge just so it kind of
fades in okay like I said before I'm
gonna go ahead and do this side and then
I'll come back and we'll can do
everything else now we're gonna do a big
great fuck-off wing and for that I'm
just gonna be using the elf expert
liquid eyeliner when I said being I
meant weak okay so that is one I'm done
so do the other one and then there will
be my being
okay so that is both eyes done for liner
I think I'm gonna do that little flicky
thing in the middle as well but I'm
gonna do not want to do my under eye
cancer and everything like that so now
for lashes I don't actually have a
drugstore brand it's gonna be
extravagant enough to go with this look
so I'm choose a random pair the pan that
I'm gonna use are just from Amber Rose
lashes in this style Venus before I
going with falsies I'm just gonna pop
some of the covergirl total tease
mascara on I use this the other day and
I actually really liked it so I'm gonna
just use it again oh I did like it until
I did that back yeah I was gonna pop a
little bit of glue on the back of these
lashes and pop them on and then I'll be
right back and we can get started on the
face lashes are now on I am loving this
look and once I put the blur under the
eyes oh I'm sorry excited okay now
moving on to the face I'm gonna be
taking the baby skin instant pore eraser
from Maybelline I have not used this in
such a long
it just feels like pure silicone but
like it does the job do you know what I
mean
for my foundation I'm gonna be using the
luminous hydrating foundation from
designer brands this is one of my
favorites I'm just gonna be pumping that
out onto the back of my hand it's
getting a foundation brush and just
painting my face back and this is Joe
we're gonna do like this now of course I
don't wet my Beauty Blender so I'm just
gonna drown it in fix applause because I
have got not so many times throughout
this video I don't think I can do it
again
all right just going in I love this all
right I'm just gonna speak just pot up
and blend out all my foundation and I'll
be back again moving back onto concealer
now that my foundation is all done just
a bit more at the mask to conceal too
so take a little bit of that this
concealer is also really good at
covering up under eye bags as well
our coverage wise as well Beauty Blender
blemish it up Joe
now to bake that all into place correct
me if I'm wrong I'm pretty sure this is
already out in Australian price lines
this is the Maybelline fit me loose
finishing powder this is in the shade
fair perfect and now to set the rest of
my face I'm going to use the Australia's
fresh and flawless in the shade of nude
okay now we're going to finish off the
under eyes I'm gonna be going back in
with the Kaleidoscope palette once again
I think I want to do two blue like at
the base and then kind of fade it into
some green maybe so I'm just gonna start
blending that blue downwards in like a
triangle sort of shape and then just
gonna dip into a little bit of the green
here I want to add that in that sugar or
that's created like the nicest color it
looks crazy now but like once I put
glitter on it's gonna make them off that
job now finishing off the rest of the
face I'm gonna be going in with the elf
contour palette and I'm gonna be using
this shade here and a little bit of this
shade here just gonna be using the zoeva
luxe sheer cheek brush
now to bronze I'm gonna be using none
other than the butter bronze up from
Physicians Formula and my whole face
it's like everything literally going
over every single bit of skin it's got a
nice like glow to it
yeah just a little bit of bottom mascara
now the glitter I'm gonna be using today
is from a brand called glitter gypsy and
this is in the shade pixie I'll leave
that in scrim down below they sent me a
bunch of glitters in PR which is
fantastic I'm gonna be taking them to
Coachella where Coachella where hope
shall I get a dick pic hey top jela when
they click hey now I don't actually have
a drugstore version of glitter glue I'm
still yet to get the next one I don't
have it sorry someone's gonna use a
little bit of the Too Faced one return
I'm not using it a little bit on the
back of my hand laughs we're gonna do
like it and I'm just gonna take a fluffy
brush dab it all over like that then I'm
gonna get my clit all OH
so the blue and the green eyeshadow that
I popped down underneath was just kind
of like a base for this just so it
wasn't too transparent just so there was
something behind it to give it a little
bit more color you know what I mean okay
guys moving on to highlighter I'm gonna
be testing out this one here from a
brand called models are and I've had
this for such a long time this is the
page pearl highlight powder and it looks
quite wet so we're gonna see how this
guy's gonna be using the BH Cosmetics
it's my rayray collaboration brush
highlighter brush
that's cute oh that's really nice so the
colors definitely appropriate for this
look I I just tested myself till it's
it's really well on the skin it's not
giving any texture or anything like that
which I do like not bad
so when I went off camera before I also
just did my inner corners and brushed my
brows into place I used the elf eyeliner
here and just set my brows I just used
the essence brass that I'll keep adding
more I'm just gonna add a little bit of
the highlighter under my brow bone to
make that area pop a little bit and just
blend it into the eye shadow below now
for my lip color because my eyes are
really crazy I am gonna stick with a
nude look today just like Holly did in
her thing and I think it looked a really
good this is the Moto rocker Born This
Way a liquid lipstick
guys I just want to add a little bit of
gloss to this okay so this pretty much
brings us to the end of today's video I
