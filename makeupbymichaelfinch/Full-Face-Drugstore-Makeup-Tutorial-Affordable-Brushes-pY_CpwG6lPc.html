if you guys want to see how I got this
look using a drugstore affordable makeup
and brushes - the lashes then keep on
watching first of all I was going to be
taking the wet and wild setting spray
and just spraying that all over my face
because I'm going to be using this as
kind of like a 6 plus thing today you're
not I'm saying oh well it's kind of like
a cleaner like a like a like a mold
cleaner or something but it'll probably
just a job ruffle so let's start off
with my eyes say so I'm assuming the
guy's been taking a little bit better
so before we drew drew my eyes today I'm
just going to take the elf eyebrow kit
and I'm just going to take the how to
shade the powder actually I'm going to
take a little bit of the dark cream
shade fur and use just to give my brows
a bit of shape and I'm using this on the
elf like little angled brush if I get to
this arch of my eyebrow here I'm just
going to go over that corner and try and
make it a little bit more usual now the
reason I'm actually doing my eyebrows on
camera for once is because I actually
wanted to do legite a full face of the
drugstore affordable products like legit
full face
- lashes because lashes are hard well
they're not hard I just don't have any
on hand you not I mean okay so I asked
this filling in my brows or with that
gel cream sort of product then I'm just
going to take the same brush I was going
to wipe off what's left on my hands but
doesn't ruin it this little eyebrow kit
here and now I'm going to take the
powder side of that and I'm just going
to go over everything I've just done
because this is going to just give it
the full you know dimension and
everything that you want especially in
the front of your brows you just push
that powder in there it's really going
to darken it up and fill in all of those
little bits that need to be filled in as
you can see I'm just flicking up with
the brush also this slider that's 40
will help a lot if you want to brush
your into play just rush it up and
do like that once my brows are all done
and filled in and then just going to
conceal the tops and bottoms of them and
I'm going to be using the wet and wild
comb correct celebrity concealer this is
in the shade medium golden because this
was
the only one they had in stock that was
the lightest so I'm gonna make it work
so I'm just going to squeeze a little
bit of that out of the tube I'm just the
back of my hand and just take this
little elf brush they don't have names
they just say elf on them so why I and
I'm just going to conceal under the brow
it's actually really good coverage like
even just concealing this I can see that
it's good coverage and then I'm just
going to kind of drag that down on my
lid while I'm here I'm a doll to conceal
the top of my brow to I'm actually so
impressed with its concealer it's really
thick and full coverage once my brows
will conceal I'm just going to take my
my ranking up I don't know and I'm just
going to blend that concealer out okay
let's move on to the eyes I'm actually
doesn't take a little bit of sticky tape
I really like using this little trick
and I'm just going to place it from
underneath my bottom lower lash line and
upwards
okay now that the sticky tape is stuck
to my eyes let's conceal my eyelids
now this little beauty sponge here is
actually from alpha as well so it's
extremely cheap and affordable service
them take some more of that celebrity
concealer that I used to do my brows
with and then I'm going to take the elf
foundation brush and I'm just going to
paint this concealer guys look at the
coverage of that that's so sick and I'm
just bringing that all the way to the
edge of this sticky tape and my whole
entire eyelid basically holy that
coverage is amazing that's actually
slower good holy okay so before
that gets a chance to crease I'm just
going to take a little bit of the elf
translucent setting powder and I'm going
to take that on my sponge again and just
set my eyelid so that does not go
anywhere same on the other eye you guys
know the drill
okay moving on to eye shadow I'm going
to be using the Alf mediate nude
eyeshadow palette and these colors in
here are just absolutely stunning and
because there is no black shade in this
palette I do like a black shade to
really make it full glam I'm just going
to take this little eyeshadow palette
from ELF this is Maxwell plum and I'm
going to be taking the black shade out
of this one afterwards okay so going in
it with V a lighter shade I'm actually
just going to pop that straight
underneath my brow bone I'm just going
to get into the magic defining
contouring and highlighting palette and
I'm actually just going to dip into the
warm brown shading here and I'm going to
be using that as much
transitions to transition shade to the
hey and I'm just going to build that up
throughout my crease and blend upwards
and I'm using this on D just an out
blending brush I guess blended up
SuperDuper well so I'm kind of excited
to see how it's gonna go on my actual
face I'm just going to take this cool
tone brown or cool tone that's not
really music but I'm just going to take
that and I'm just going to put it on my
outer V and kind of just really like
focus on blending it into the crease
just going to add in a bit of the darker
shade as well now as I said before I'm
just going to take some of that black
shade out of that other eye shadow
palette and just pop that on line out of
V as well and now I'm going to go back
to my other blending brush and really
focus on getting this blended out nicely
not what I really need to focus because
it's actually quite easy to blend this
out which is surprisingly good just
generously going back in there with more
of that black it's kind of like a off
blue it's not really black but I'm just
going to drag that up through here kind
of over my hood area there and taking
more of that cool tone of brown shade
I'm just going to put that over the edge
and blend that up and out okay now I'm
going to take this a flat top eyeshadow
brush and I'm going to dip straight into
that really really pretty gold shade
there and then I'm going to spray my
brush a little bit of the wet and wild
makeup setting spray right back into
that eye shadow and then apply that
straight on my lid
cool that gold has actually come up
sorry well was a bit of thing at makeup
setting spray the goal is kind of hard
to work with as a start but the more you
pack on and the more setting spray that
you spray on your brush the better the
application looks now it's going to
blend around those edges of that gold to
make sure there are no clashes or
anything nasty now the most satisfying
part I'm just going to take the sticky
tape off oh my god crisp AF okay now for
winged liner I'm just going to take the
NYC liquid eyeliner I know this is
Krispies Holy Grail liquid liner so have
high-spec taejun's of this some just
come on folks I've already it
okay so that wings with a little bit
dodgy underneath but um it's going to
all work out in the end I can assure you
that okay so this eyeliner is so much
better than this slide but because
because we'll match it up in the end
when I do underneath my eyes okay so for
mascara today this is the jordana best
lash extreme volumizing mascara and a
little bit about this as well it smells
very makeup you know when you get
drugstore makeup and it has that makeup
smell
I don't mind it though it's not that bad
okay so because I do not have any
drugstore or affordable lashes I'm just
going to glue some on off-camera and
I'll be right back and we will get
started on the face and I'm actually
loving this so much like to these
products are actually working so well
okay guys so now that my lashes are all
on I'm actually really impressed with
how this looks so far let's move on to
the face so for primer the primer I'm
going to be using the wet and wild
coverall primer cool thank you so I'm
just going to take that straight on I
always smell things lower than my face
doesn't really have a smell to be honest
it's just kind of playing okay primer is
now on now moving on to foundation this
is the mud makeup design long-lasting
foundation in the shade Newt and so I'm
just going to pump a few squirts about
onto the back of my hand
and then before doing that I'm just
going to spritz my face with the wet
wild setting phrases to would stand up
the area I guess that is taking my damp
out sponge I'm just going to dip into
that and just go all over not bad for
coverage I am tan at the moment so well
I'm a little bit tan of what's left of
it so I'm just matching that to my neck
the reason I drew these drugstore
tutorials guys is because I know a lot
of people don't want to go out and spend
money on makeup which is totally fine
because makeup isn't everybody's forte
do not I mean I really want to wire out
into drugstore affordable like brushes
need to get some drugstore lashes like
affordable lashes as well just because I
want to suit everyone like a lot of
people do want to see drugstore in that
but a lot of people do you want to see
high end as well so I'm going to be
doing heaps and heaps and heaps of both
this is quite label I guess so I'm just
going to put another layer over the top
is label even a word
oh well I just made it up now put that
in your dictionary with that in your
 store for thoris whatever it is
the only thing I'm noticing about this
sponge is that it's actually soaking up
a lot of the foundation and a lot of the
product and I'm just going to put a
little bit more over my chin area
because it doesn't take to that all the
best I'm actually really impressed with
this foundation guys not joking it's
good for the price do you not I mean
like it's good now just taking my
soon-to-be new favorite drugstore
concealer I think it's so friggin good
well it was for my brows in my eye base
don't know about the face but let's find
out so this is the weight loss celebrity
concealer as I just said it earlier and
I'm just going to do the middle part of
my face first I'm going to put a bit
around the sides of my mouth as well
it's for a little bit more coverage and
can't forget this jolly forehead big
jolly forehead Hey oh my god I just jab
myself in the eye did you guys see that
 bad okay so I'm going to take
that same sponge and blend this all our
just blends out so well over my nose oh
my god that it was so easy to blend now
taking more of that concealer on my
under eyes to conceal my under eye area
just on that same sound good lead Asian
brush notice taking my damp sponge again
I'm just going to blend that and seal it
out oh my god I think this is my new
favorite drugstore concealer Maybelline
fit me what now to set and bake
everything into place today I'm just
going to be using me cookie as fun
powder you guys know this is one of my
favorite affordable powders and var so
I'm just going to generously pack that
onto my sponge and straight in on
underneath my eyes now if you haven't
smelt this before you might be put off
by the smell but honestly it doesn't
last that long and it's worth putting up
with the smell for the product I'm also
kind of pushing that all over my nose as
well more so baking my nose actually now
I'm just going to take that Cody
translucent
powder and just dust it all over the
rest of my face just to set all of that
foundation okay well sorry Matt right
now and I'm kind of loving it
moving on to contouring this is the
Revlon sculpt and highlight Chloe
Morello collaboration so I'm just going
to take the I guess bronzy shorter sort
of shade out of here just on it this
fluffy brush here and I'm just going to
kind of pop that on my cheek and I'm
also going to bring that up around my
forehead as well okay once that is all
blended and we are all contoured and
bronze I guess I'm just going to take
the elf blush kit and I'm just gonna
take through this peachy College chase
yeah this is very me and I'm just gonna
take it on this elf brush here and I'm
just going to generously dip in are
going to have pigmented they are so and
then I'm just gonna but on my cheek it's
not very pigmented which is good that's
what you want in a blush though you can
actually build the color out rather than
just having a straight you know too much
blush there just to further contour my
face a little bit I'm just going to take
that mud and makeup design contouring
palette and I'm going to take this cool
tone shade right here just to contour my
face a little bit more it blends so
freakin well I'm so impressed with these
parks and on my bottom lip a little bit
and can't forget to contour the chin and
the jaw line so important for me it is
it's going to do me guys it again just
so you can see my under eyes okay
so through my under eyes I'm was going
to take this elf eyeliner pencil and I'm
just going to go straight in my
waterline
okay once my waterlines covered I'm just
going to take one of those cool tone
Browns from the Alpha palette that we
used as a start and I'm just going to
blend that slack down but I'm going to
take a little bit of that warm color
brown from the contour palette again and
just go straight underneath everything
now just to further darken that I'm just
going to take that black shade from that
little elf eyeshadow palette and I'm
just going to put that straight up again
my last one this will darken it and make
filled in a little spice area and then
just blending that all together that
looks cool okay I'm just going to do the
other eye and I'll be right back okay
now that my under eyes are all done I'm
just going to dust off that under eye
bag I've already dropped it off a little
bit cause it could get a bit of fallout
from the shadows that's right now if you
highlight my face today I'm just going
to be taking the wet and wild
highlighting powder and this is in the
shade precious petals so I'm going to
take that on the elf highlighting brush
and just get in full it's quite powdery
not bad not bad it's not actually
bringing out much color I might actually
have to change this brush I'm just going
to switch to my other staff here brush
sorry and I'm just going to pop that oh
that's that ah that's so much nice so
much nice so much nicer I'm just going
to spray my brush with a little bit of
the wet and wild just putting a little
bit one because why not it blends really
well like it's not chunky or anything
like that I'm also just going to take a
little bit of that highlighter just on
light in the corners and I'm also just
going to be putting a little bit under
my brow bone
can't forget bottom lashes I'm just
going to take the jobs on a mascara that
I used before and just pop this on wow
that's actually really good for bottom
lashes and now last but not least for my
live color today I'm going to be using
the liquid cat food megalast matte
liquid lipstick from wet and wild and
this is in the shade rebel rose it's
kind of kind of amazing a dose of colors
story but a bit more pink
I guess so I'm just going to pop this on
but I don't think I like that for
today's look so instead I'm just going
to take the wet and wild liquid lipstick
in the shade it is a cutie hopefully
this is more suitable for this look
okay so what I actually ended up doing
for my lips is just taking a bit more of
that pink shade that I used earlier
going over that nude lipstick and really
blending it all out so it created this
pretty cute color and now the last step
today I'm just going to take the wet and
wild and makeup setting spray that I use
all throughout this video and just set
everything on my face okay so this is
the completed look I really hope you
