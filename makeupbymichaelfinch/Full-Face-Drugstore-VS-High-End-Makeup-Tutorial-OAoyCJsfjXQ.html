today I'm going to be doing half
drugstore and half high-end to see if
you can spot the difference now the
whole point of this video is to prove
that you don't need high-end makeup to
get a flawless looking face if that
makes sense so the products I'm using
today are not drugstore dupes
they are just drugstore products
compared to high-end products that are
similar in color so you can see the
difference if there is one which I hope
there's more it's the whole point let's
get straight into it
so for primer on the drugstore side I'm
going to be using the maybelline baby
skin primer and on the high-end side I'm
going to be using benefits Porefessional
now a lot of people have been saying
that this is a dupe for the professional
but honestly it's really not that's just
what I think this is so much more
silicone II and like stickier the other
one is more like smooth silky and like
flawless feeling if that makes any sense
everything onto eyebrows on the
drugstore side this isn't a drugstore
products but it's very affordable this
is the Mellen cosmetics dip brow pomade
and on the high-end side I'm going to be
using the anastasia beverly hills
dipbrow in the shade blonde okay
so just using the mellow dip brow I've
just filled in this brow honestly my
brows are playing up so much lately they
need to be like wax they're so hairy and
I fucking hate them at the moment now
for the high-end side I'm just gonna be
taking my Anastasia dip brow this is
probably a lot more well it is a lot
more dry than the mellow one that um
they both kind of do the same thing in
the end that's just more weapons more
dry you know how we all have a good brow
and a bad brow this is my good eyebrow
the other ones just fucked now moving on
to your eyebrows setting gel I'm going
to be using the Rimmel brow this way
setting gel and on the high-end side I'm
going to be using benefits of gimme brow
I'm literally just brushing that through
my eyebrows eyebrow ah sorry and
now benefits a gimme brow this is just
going to set my eyebrows in place and
tint the blond hairs that I have in
amongst all this hair now moving on to
concealer on the drugstore side I'm
going to be using the Maybelline master
conceal and finally high-end side I'm
going to be using the Todd shape take
concealer I can't talk when I'm doing do
and what I'm going to do is just drag
that down a little bit just so it's
easier to blend now on the high end so
I'm just going to take a bit of shape
tape this is such a high coverage
concealer it's menu favorite concealer
ever and as you can see this concealer
is a little bit lighter than the other
one but that don't matter because we're
going to make it work now just putting a
bit more of the Maybelline master
conceal all over this island because
they're going to be using this is our
eye base today which is what I do with
all my makeup looks they never use a
primer I just use concealer because I
feel like it's just so much better I'm
just going to be blending that out with
my damp Beauty Blender now on the
drugstore side this is not a drugstore
product but it's very very affordable so
same thing this is the card es1 powder
and on the high-end side I'm going to be
using the Elora messy edge
setting powder so just taking some of
that Cody s fun I'm just going to be
setting all of that concealer to a
shoulder it does not crease and I'm just
gonna be running a bit more of the shape
tape concealer over that eye and just
blending that in now just taking my
Laura Mercier I'm just going to be
setting up all that concealer as well
now moving on to eyeshadow on the
drugstore side I'm going to be using
this chichi cosmetics eyeshadow palette
this is the timeless palette it's so
pretty and on the high-end side I'm
going to be using the Kylie cosmetics
bronze eyeshadow palette
so on the drugstore side I'm just using
the chichi Cosmetics palette obviously
I'm just taking some of this brown shade
and kind of putting it through my crease
um now basically this palette was not as
good as I expected it to be so many
people have hyped up the chichi
eyeshadow palette and I was so excited
and I'm not gonna lie when I say I have
pretty high standards for eyeshadows
after using uh Nastasia makeup geek and
huda beauty but honestly it was just
kind of patchy and it didn't blend out
very well the shadows this one I'm using
right now I was definitely not even it
at all um and I'm not a very big fan of
the Kylie Jenner palette but honestly it
was so much better than the chichi want
it blended better it lay it up nicely it
was more buttery um I still think the
Kylie one is a little bit chalky but
comparing it to the chichi one it was
buttery like oh um so yeah I'm just
doing a bit of an eye look there but can
you tell the difference I definitely can
I definitely can alright let's go on to
the rest of the face whoo so now that
the ishow is done let's move on to
eyeliner so on the drugstore side I'm
going to be using DF Maybelline studio
gel liner and on the high-end slide I'm
going to be using the Inglot AMC gel
liner in this shade 77
now moving on to mascara mascara in my
opinion is just one of those things that
every sort of mascara works it just
might have a different effect on your
lashes but regardless it's still going
to be black so on the drugstore side I'm
going to be using the Maybelline great
lash and on the high-end side I'm going
to be using the Tarte Tartus mascara now
the only thing I don't have is drugstore
eyelashes so I'm just going to chuck a
random pair of lashes on and I'll be
right back and we'll continue on with
the rest of the base okay so I just
chucked some lashes on let's move on to
the rest of the face or on the drugstore
side I'm going to be using the NYX HD
photogenic foundation and on the
high-end side I'm going to be using my
all-time favorites remarkable in the
shade 54 let's do drugstore first so I'm
going to put some of that on the back of
my hand well a lot and I'm just going to
paint that bond before blending that out
of a beauty blender now just taking my
damp Beauty Blender I'm just going to
begin to blend all of that foundation
into my hairline and my skin now the
reason why it's so dark is because I
matching it to my tan I have to tell
everyone that in every video that I do
it because some people knew and they
don't understand why when I'm tan the
moment I'm matching it to my tan
yeah moving on to your high inside I'm
just going to take my Marc Jacobs
remarkable and just pull it about that
much on that's what we like a lot Rob
our people that over that wall that
would cover my whole face they probably
would but I'm all about that full
coverage sort of life so I'm just going
to begin to your blend this into the
side of my face and this should what
I've just put on cover my whole part of
my face
now just taking my beauty blender I'm
just going to blend all of that in so it
is seamless AF now to conceal the under
eyes I'm going to be going back to my
Maybelline concealer and the tight shake
tape so what I'm going to do is just put
a little bit on each side to make it
fair so this is the drug store side so
I'm just going to blend that out before
I move on to the other side and now
moving on to the high inside I'm just
going to take my shape tape and you'll
need a little tiny bit of this but do I
really listen when people say that no
and now I'm going to go absolute ham
under this eye once again I'm just going
to be blending that out with my damp
Beauty Blender as you can see this side
is a lot more whiter and more high
coverage which is basically you get what
you pay for when you buy drugstore
concealers but they still can be really
really great now moving back onto my
translucent powder for the drug
Strongsville using s fun and behind I'm
going to be using the laura mercier now
I'm moving on to powder to set the rest
of my face I'm just going to be using
the Australis fresh and flawless pressed
powder and on the high-end side I'm
going to be using via nas pressed powder
so just setting everything so it does
not move and now on the high-end side
I'm just going to be taking a beach and
also setting that now I'm just finishing
off the eyes mind that face I was trying
to get it in frame it just wasn't
working that is the drugstore side just
with the chichi palate I'm just putting
it into the brown and a little bit of
black just to define it and then same on
the other eye a bit of the warm brown
and then a bit of the black to define it
again - now that the eye shadow has all
finished I'm just going to be wiping off
the under eye Bank yeah moving on to
contouring and bronzing on the drugstore
side I'm going to be using the Revlon
sculpt and highlight contour kit and on
the high-end side I'm going to be using
the obviously Anastasio Beverly Hills
contour kit so I'm just going to be
taking a bit of the shade and a bit of
this shade is my first time at using
this so I don't know how pigmented it's
gonna be or how well it's gonna work but
already it blends so well I'm really
impressed already and obviously just
contouring my non-existant draw line a
bit so I'm just gonna be making one of
those and with whatever is left on the
brush I'm just gonna run that down the
side of my nose
now just to bronze up a little bit more
I'm just going to take a little bit over
the bronzing shade out of that Revlon
kit and just give my cheeks a little bit
more warm and on the high-end side I'm
just going to warm up my face with a
little bit of Mac give me son now moving
on to blush on Italy a drugstore side
I'm going to be using the Milani baked
blush in the shade
luminoso and on the high end I'm going

my cheeks and blending backwards and now

that backwards as well now for banana
powder on the drugstore side I'm going
to be using the Australis banana powder

different they look so similar in the

look stupid otherwise now for gloss on
