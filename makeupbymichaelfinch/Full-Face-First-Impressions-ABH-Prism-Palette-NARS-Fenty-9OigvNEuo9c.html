channel so today I'm going to be doing a
another full face of first impressions I
know it was only a couple of weeks ago
it seems like a few days ago that I did
one of these but I'm doing another one
because I've got a shit ton of new
makeup that I want to try out as per
usual and I don't really know what look
I'm gonna do but I've got a lot of shit
to play with without any further ado
let's get straight into this video and
get to fucking work because I've had
enough so as you can tell my brows are
already done as I do them all the time
off-camera just to fill in time and I
don't have anything new to try out on
the brows today however for once I do
have a and you can sell it to try out
this is the NARS
soft matte complete concealer this is in
the shade vanilla I picked up a bunch of
shit from Mecca so this is where I got
this from and why don't you try this for
Safari along and I just never got around
to it because I'm shit right so I'm
assuming they're starting with this
concealer right underneath my brow
chicken feel and I'm gonna be using it
as an eye base all right so this is
concealing my brow really quite nicely
I'm just gonna put a little bit more
into my lid I'm just gonna blend this
out with the Sigma brush blending out
really nicely but I'm more excited to
see how this concealer guards under the
eyes rather than on the eyes
alright I'm just gonna set this with a
little bit of translucent powder oh my
god that looks disgusting my brow that's
butt off I have to pull my face up
because my botox doesn't allow me to
look up and raise my forehead oh it does
to an extent Oh anyway now for my eye
shadow today I'm finally gonna be trying
out the Anastacio present palette now I
bought this when it first came out and
honestly I just never got around to
actually trying the damn thing out so
I'm gonna give it a whirl now I did see
that uh Nastasia is coming out with a
new palette very soon and it does look
like one and that I'm gonna buy I don't
know why I bought this probably to
review for you guys but um the colors
don't least stand out to me whatsoever
but the new one that she's coming out
with looks absolutely like phenom so I'm
so excited for that
all right so the first shade I'm gonna
take is this one called Eden Eternia and
I'm just gonna start off adding that
into my crease area you know and
bringing this this is a hella pigmented
I really pray that her new palette that
she's bringing out is good and not like
another subculture up in this bitch okay
I'm kind of like winging this out also
I'm just gonna take a little bit more of
that color and just pack on a tiny bit
more Oh in I'm gonna bring this all the
way into my inner corner now I'm gonna
take the shade called Sasson which is
like a really nice Orange II sort of
color and I'm just going to place this
below
oh so nervous to try this palette
because I thought it was gonna be
another subculture but did you know
sometimes when you use a really shit
makeup like from a brain it kind of
turns you off ever you know buying from
them again
and I blend the two together with that
brush I used before I'm just gonna point
out I fucking hate this color right here
like what am I gonna use that I mean
some people might that's good it's
different but I look at that and I think
that looks like Pig vomit like yuck now
I'm just going in with a shade called
parallel parallel aware I'm just gonna
take a little bit of that and pop it on
to be out of thing I'm just gonna take
what's left over on that brush I'm kind
of blend out that a little bit and
slightly bring it through the area now
I'm gonna take an even denser brush and
I'm just gonna go in with the shade
obsidian just jet-black really low I'm
not going with this look look I don't
even art I'm gonna get some sticky tape
cuz I was just something different right
that maybe we'll do like a smoky wing
I don't know all right so I'm gonna take
obsidian and I'm gonna put it up I'm
gonna worry about the lid later cuz I
wanna work on this part I'm gonna take a
little bit more of parallel which is the
dark brown color I'm gonna blend over
the edges with the black take a little
bit of that orangey shade and just blend
over the edge I'm gonna zoom you guys in
a little bit so I can see that huh
now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna bring
obsidian oh for my crazy no I don't
really know exactly what I'm doing right
now but I'm just gonna go with the fly
okay going with the flow
alright now that I've got a little that
laid down I'm gonna go back in with the
shade called parallel and I'm just going
to super lightly try and blend out this
black car
now I'm just gonna take my brush but I
had the orange color on the satin one
and just gently buff out this line
so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
like a like a cup the crease because I
can so I can have a really intense shade
on the lid area doing that all over the
lid then looking straight up just so I
get that line so I know where this
concealer is going to go
okay so basically I just have to take a
quick phone call hence Wow in a little
bit maa but what I did was I just
finished off cutting the crease and then
I took a shade called pyramid and pop
that straight over the top of my lid and
then I just took a little bit of
obsidian and popped it on the outer V
and kind of more so just blended it into
the gold and it blended together really
really nice so far I'm loving this
palette the pigmentation is absolutely
everything and the way that the shadows
lay on top of each other okay moving on
to a bit of gel liner what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna take well it's not gel
liner this is from the brand called rms
beauty now I got this at Mecca and this
is their vintage cake liner so it is a
powder and I do believe you're meant to
mix a little bit of water with it to
create kind of like a thick paste so I'm
just gonna spray some fix+ on my makeup
just here alright so it kind of creates
like a paste really thin which I'm
loving then I'm going to go in and just
do from the middle to the outer edge
okay so that's created a really nice
thin line I just use the morphe and 1r6
brush I think crucial this is an
eyeliner brush yeah I'm loving this okay
now I'm gonna take off this tape huh
start satisfying right moving on to
mascara I'm gonna be trying out the Mac
bold and bad lashes this packaging is so
cool it kind of feels like felt I know
it's sick all right all right so this
has carded the lashes of really nicely
and they're super black but not really
different to any other mascara that I've
really used before that there's nothing
like wow factor about it okay moving
onto eyelashes I'm gonna be taking these
lungs from lash worries this is a new
style that I haven't tried out these are
in the style I have no fucking idea but
I will leave them down below if I can
find them on the website this will be so
similar to the makeup that jar did on me
for my 21st birthday getting some
serious makeup by jaw vibes okay so
these lashes are now on and they look
like natural ish but they're like still
showing that I have a lash line because
I need a big lash to like go with this
makeup anyway okay so getting started on
the face I'm gonna be trying out the
professional pearl primer from benefit
this is a new one that they've just come
out with it's pretty much meant to do
the same as the professional I think but
it's got like a pinky tinge to it
lightweight silky soft pink oh yes it's
very pink well it smells like bubblegum
not I'm just going to my face
now unfortunately I do not have a new
foundation to try out today so I'm just
gonna go in with the NARS foundation
this is the natural radiant long wear
foundation I
been absolutely living breathing washing
my dishes than making my bed for this it
is absolutely incredible
I love it my God my beauty blender is
not wet I'm just gonna drown it because
honestly the amount of times I've gotten
up during this video to get something
that I've forgotten is beyond a joke
okay
the fix plus I've been using lately is
the one from Mac this is the new scent
there's laughs and dry and coconut
coconut smells really good too but I
don't know where I put it
this foundation is in the shade Yukon
it's got like a pinky under turn soft
perfect for my skin I'm just sorry good
the way this foundation like packs onto
my nose and sticks to it so well they're
like the most even layer is astounding
it's just it's perfect
okay it's literally perfect I'm just
gonna take that NARS concealer and I'm
just going to conceal the tops of my
brows okay so my foundation is all done
now I'm just going to conceal with that
same NARS concealer I'm just going to do
my chin a little bit around my nose
certainly nearly on my forehead because
I just perhaps a concealer there to
conceal my brows but we will do under
the eyes
once I've concealed all of that and then
just gonna go straight back in with my
Bodi looking ass blender and just blend
this time still around this has a really
full coverage and it's a really thin
consistency as well so it's not too
thick like via touch tape tape even
though I love that concealer it's really
thin but it has really good coverage and
its got like a creamy texture to it
which is kind of new to me that's all
done and blend it out now I'm gonna be
going in with this Urban Decay The
Velvet eyes are
translucent mixing medium I'm pretty
sure this can be used to set your
under-eyes
I hope I'm just gonna bake my chin
that's what like it's got color to it
that literally just covered up all the
concealer brightness oh no this has too
much polish why I'm not using this to
set my under eyes that's just added so
much color there nope nope nope it's
probably a really great powder to set
the rest of the face with but it's too
dark for under the eyes and I'm not
risking ruining this look instead I'm
just gonna going with my cover effects
translucent powder being loving this so
much lately cause I'm not right in true
you Condor eyes I'm gonna take a little
bit more and just pop it right here just
a little bit nervous about there the
fallout that might happen under the eyes
okay now that my undereyes are all done
I'm just going to dust off this bake
that I've got here I'm really shook
about this palette like I wish I tried
it sooner it's good it's so good I'm
also just popping on a little bit of the
mock mascara okay so now that everything
is set on my face I'm just gonna be
going in with the Stila contouring
bronzer for face and body so this is
like a contour slash bronzer in one it's
fully matte it's gonna take the morphe
r7 brush and use this to bronze on my
face oh my god look at my old morphe
brush r7 compared to the new one that I
just got holy shit
so I'm just gonna take a little bit of
this I'm just gonna go in and start
contouring a slash bronzing you know the
process so it's blending out really
really nicely like super nicely but I
feel like it's a tad tad orange and I'm
pretty sure this is the lightest shade
that they have just contouring down my
jolly forehead actually I take that back
I don't think it is orange like it's
true orange it kind of has a bit of a
call undertone to it I think as it goes
on I'm not sure what do you think so I
just went off camera and contoured my
nose a little bit as huge if you guys
want to see a conch a nose contour
tutorial like a fawn like snatch nose
contour tutorial for pale skin like my
skin tone let me know in the comments
below
anyway I'm moving on to blush I'm just
gonna be taking this one from Mac
this is peaches I saw Gabriel some more
always talks about this song like I
can't even get it because I wanna see
what it looks like on my skin so I'm
just going to go in with a stipple see
your nipple brush this is the extra
Beauty blush brush a little bit a color
into my cheeks yeah that's super pretty
it's just adds like a pink tinge okay
guys so we're almost done also go do is
highlight in my lips and then set the
face so for highlighter I'm just gonna
be using this one from be quiet see I
have used this before but I'm literally
in love with it so I'm gonna be using it
again today so this is a mineral
highlighter so it's in a powder form but
wait until you guys see how blinding
this is being d sorry I'm just gonna be
taking my highlighter brush here that I
got from morphe this is the M 510 brush
finally got a new highlighter brush
holla I'm just gonna spritz my face with
a little bit of fix+ beforehand that was
a lot but it smells so freakin good just
gonna let that dry off a bit before I go
in with the highlighter this just get
sort of like the cakey look and
everything this doesn't actually set to
makeup alright so going in with this
highlighter you guys ready like what so
I'm just gonna focus this on these super
high point on my face so just on the tip
of my cheekbone where it's super
prominent and kind of blend around the
edges and then you can just keep adding
more and more and more I'm just building
it's super super blinding just
continuing on blending this up the side
of my face more or less and just
blending around the edges and kind of
bringing it down onto the apple of my
cheek because I love doing that I'm just
gonna take a smaller brush and just
apply a little bit to the tip of my nose
and along the bridge to add more pigment
now it's gonna take a little flat top
brush and I'm just going to apply some
to the inner corners of my eyes
cannot forget the Cupid's bow now for my
lips hmm I've got three as the new fenty
and lipsticks that I want to try out
I've got three different shades here
just to know what would be the best for
this look I feel like this one might be
this is in the shade up to no good
Oh Oh actually this is different now
that's challenge I'm gonna go image the
shade called single instead this looks a
little bit more appropriate I got the
Taha
holy shit the pigmentation now oh my god
these are sorry pigmented Wow how am I
gonna do this cuz I hate using lip line
offs on my ah guys believe it or not I'm
just taking one of my most hated enemies
this is a sponge tip applicator but it's
on a steak and I thought it would just
be good to apply this without getting
like a really hot line this lipstick is
sorry beautiful the formula is sorry
nice I can just tell that this is gonna
be such a nice formula and I'm gonna use
this a lot when I go out clubbing
because when I go out clubbing I don't
my liquid lipstick because it just goes
all mushy so I just line it that was
fantastic
to set I don't really have anything new
um but I don't really in particularly
want to set this form just some spray
bit morphix plus okay guys so this is
the end of today's video I hope you guys
really enjoyed it I'm sorry it went for
quite a while but that's what you get
with first impressions I guess I'm sorry
impressed with the eye shadow palette
like I'm sorry sad that I haven't tried
it out sooner and the lipstick is
definitely a favorite probably three
favorites from this whole thing is the I
shudder at the highlighter and probably
the lipstick if you guys enjoyed this
