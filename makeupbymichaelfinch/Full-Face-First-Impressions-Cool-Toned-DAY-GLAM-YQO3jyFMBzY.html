channel today I'm gonna be doing a full
face of first impressions one skin
because it got so much news like a
makeup I just want to keep doing these
 videos today I'm a little bit
hungry but as always it is a Monday so
I'm a little bit hungover but what's new
to be honest honestly Soho Sunday's just
 me up every single time and I
always do this to myself
so my Monday's are pretty rude
so my Monday's are pretty much what
should be a Sunday but I got out on
Sundays not Saturdays so I've got quite
a bit of new makeup that I'm gonna be
testing out in today's video and I'm
excited because I haven't tried any of
it before besides like one thing that's
cuz I don't have a new concealer to try
but um let's get into it
okay guys for getting straight into it I
don't have a new brow product to try out
unfortunately some time ago straight up
on in here with my precisely my brow
pencil from a Benefit Cosmetics Delia
started me filling in my natural brow
shape this is literally my favorite brow
product ever just putting it out there
okay now that my brows are done let's go
straight onto my eyes I'm just gonna
zoom you guys in so you can see a little
bit better just getting straight into it
I'm gonna be taking the Kat Von D a look
at concealer now I have actually used
this before but I actually never reached
for it just because taut shape type has
taken over my literal life but I'm gonna
be using this as an eye base today okay
guys so I'm just gonna be concealing
underneath my brow with that and then
I'm just gonna drag it is the down
honey give it then I'm just gonna take
that and pop it over my lids just a
little bit for a change for a change
then I wasn't take my damp Beauty
Blender yesterday's damp I actually wet
it before I started filming because I'm
starting to get really good at time and
I hope you guys are enjoying my site ten
hands now I'm gonna go ahead and set
that with the Kat Von D a look at a
blotting powder this is in the shade
light I have not tried this before so
it's gonna take a little bit of that on
my brush and just lightly set my lids
now for my eyeshadow today I'm gonna be
trying out this eyeshadow from
colour-pop this is the I love Sarah II I
think it's pronounced differently
because I know a lot of people pronounce
it like Anna
sree or something like that I'm not
really sure how to say it so apologies
if I pronounced it wrong but this is a
gorgeous palette I've been wanting to
try it for so long this is what the
shades inside Oobleck lack so there's
four different shades you've got a
shimmery one like a gorge one and then
like to sort of cool toned one so I'm
just gonna do a little eye look with
this first of all I'm going to take the
lightest shade and I'm just gonna pop
this above my brow bone and I'm just
gonna bring it down onto my lid true
just so much shadows will blend better
now I was gonna go into the lightest
shade I'm just to see how people in
today's eye I don't think I've used
color pop matte shadows before I did get
some FBI package from the other day so
I've got quite a bit of it to try out so
I'm just gonna pop this in my outer-v
a pigment is good
this is blending out super super well as
well as you can probably tell and then
I'm gonna bring that shadow all the way
into my inner corner she's my air
conditioner which shot it's a little
whole cuz I'm over it
so I'm more or less just building up the
color I'm just gonna take it clean that
blending brush and it just blend out
that edge there I'm just gonna take a
more denser brush and just pack on more
of that color and just get it right up
in there huh next I'm gonna be taking
this darkest shade out of the palette
this was the first one I used the second
one and third one on the top here and
I'm more or less just gonna pop that
straight up one and harden just taking
that other brush that I used before with
the brown I'm just gonna blend out that
color I just pop down on these shadows
are so good they're literally like not
blending away
they're staying where I put them which
is always a positive thing I don't know
if you guys can tell but the blend
ability of this shadow and the build
ability is so good considering the price
amazing collar pop is such enough for
of all brand and I love it when you find
a brand that's affordable and it works
well the consistency of the shutters
kinda reminds me of makeup gate like
that's what sort of level they're on I
feel OK fam now I'm gonna take some more
of the account one day look at concealer
I was gonna pump a little bit on the
back of my hand because when do you like
a semi sort of race you know that
look I'm just gonna drag this all over
my lid I always do my cut crease is
higher than with my actual hood is just
because I do have hooded eyes it doesn't
transfer and you don't lose like the
whole point of the cut crease because
it'll just transfer and go everywhere
I'm just gonna take a random blending
brush and kind of just blend over the
edges of the concealer huh just so it's
not like just a big cutoff line and then
I'm gonna take the shimmery shade from
the palette I'm just gonna pack this on
my lid once the eyeshadows on I was
going to take a blending brush more so
just blend the edges in so I've kind of
just told blends in together you know
I'm just gonna finish this eye and then
we'll get started on my face okay guys
so moving on to Pilate today I'm gonna
be testing out the mecca Maxima
bring it on bright illuminating primer
now these guys have just launched a
whole new ton of makeup and I did get
sent a bit of it and I've heard really
positive things about the bronzer the
primer the eyeshadows the liquid
eyeshadow things so I'm very very
excited right now and I'm just gonna
take some of this primer and I'm just
gonna pop it on my face oh my god Becca
backlight anyone it smells amazing oh my
god
bye it smells so good look at the glory
that that's giving my skin is that not
like amazing okay bye now for my
foundation I'm gonna be testing out the
Kat Von D a locket foundation this has
been around for so long and I've
literally never tried it in my natural
life so I don't actually know how to
open
contain to be honest I don't oh there we
go
had a little lid alright so so this is
way too light for me at the moment as
you can tell sorry I'm it's gonna mix in
a little bit of the lemare foundation
just because it's like a little bit
darker and it's perfect when you mix it
with something so I can't really give
you a first impressions on the cap on D
foundation but let's see if this is a
good combo I had saw way too light I
have to mix in more sorry guys so I'm
just gonna paint this all over my face
as I normally do like a literal painting
a literal clown you know now it's gonna
take my Beauty Blender my damp Beauty
Blender and just go to town okay so
already the coverage is so good now but
I don't know if it's the locket or if
it's the Lamia one which sucks but it's
true like for me and I needed to use it
today in this video but the combo of
these two together is gorge I'm just
gonna get another shape I'm just gonna
get another color of their Kat Von D so
it matches me better now to conceal my
under eyes on somebody going back in
with the Kat Von D and I'm just gonna
highlight on my chin would just like a
little bit today I'm just gonna
highlight a little bit cuz we've got
these drops that I want to try out and
I'm just gonna pull in and
and now just to conceal my under eyes
I'm just gonna take a little bit of this
concealer do a little bit today let's
see how we go just not much that is
shocking compared to what I normally use
let's be let's be honest and I'm just
gonna bring this concealer all up the
side of my little face I really really
really really enjoyed this concealer a
lot okay now to do a little bit of
baking underneath my eyes are gonna be
testing out the new two-faced Born This
Way translucent powder I've heard so
many amazing things about this so
let's give it a whirl and see what
happens we got a cute little lid here
that could be annoying but doesn't
matter just gonna bang some of that out
into the lid and I was gonna dip my
Beauty Blender into this baking I'm just
gonna avoid this area because I've got
these drops that I'm gonna try out as I
said before so I'm just gonna push this
into my under eyes it's got a bit of
like a yellow like warm tone to it next
I'm gonna be trying out these drops from
iconic London now I've heard certain
amazing things about these and I've just
never tried them so I've got the shades
called original and shine so I'm gonna
mix these two together see what happens
now this is why I didn't want to fake as
much a little bit on my nose my nose
bridge keep it's because why not and
then I'm gonna take some of the shake
old original which is like a Goldy sort
of tone and I'm gonna mix that in with
that more sorry I don't know how much to
use then I'm gonna take the clean side
of my Beauty Blender and I'm gonna blend
this out that's pretty
oh it's intense that's all I can say I
like it though get this noise bridge
happening wow actually really lack days
I'm actually just gonna put a little bit
above my brows too cuz I'm loving this
glowy sort of look oh I'm actually gonna
take a little bit more of the shade
called shine because I want to be extra
glowy I'm gonna pop a little bit more on
my cheeks just gonna blend that out once
again oh my goodness it's actually
stunning I'm just gonna bounce a little
bit more up on my forehead of what's
left on the blender but look how
pigmented this is that looks re pretty
sure I don't even think goes on my
 brushes great so I'm just gonna
take the Kat Von D powder again I'm just
gonna set the rest of my face avoiding
the areas where I put the liquid glow so
this will just help my foundation stay
in place all day and then I think I
still got a little bit of powder
underneath my eye so I'm just gonna dust
thrown away because we don't need it
anymore okay guys now I'm just gonna
finish off my under eyes so I'm just
gonna take this shake here again from
the color palette and I'm just gonna
dunk this straight underneath my lower
lash line and then I'm gonna take an
even denser brush and I'm just gonna get
to this colour here and I'm gonna pop it
right in my outer corner of my eye and
just focus on the outer edge it's gonna
blend out that Center with a little bit
more of the brown okay now for my
bronzer today I'm gonna be testing out
the mecca Mac's
bronzer this is in the shade sunlit skin
oh and I'm so excited because Ronnie
literally was raving about this the
other day so let's get into it
I'm just gonna be taking this big
fuck-off brush here and just dipping
into the bronzer and just kind of going
underneath where I've put that how
straighting the drops can't even
talk today thank ya wouldn't wanna be ya
should we bring in that under my jawline
and just in the areas where you
regularly bronze and this is such a
beautiful color I think I'm a little bit
too pale at the moment for it bottom the
lip just getting a puff in your hairline
and I'm also it's gonna run a little bit
down the side of my nose now I'm just
gonna be doing a tiny bit of contouring
using the Kat Von D shade and light
palette so I'm just gonna be taking this
middle shade right here and maybe a
little bit of this cool train here and
I'm just gonna begin to slightly contour
not too much just a little bit today I
want to keep it nice and glowy and like
you know cute but I'm just gonna go
pretty harsh on his jaw line as I always
do cuz I need to for my mascara today
I'm gonna be trying to make a max
mascara such a gorge tube oh my god
we've got two sides
it's got a little side I didn't know
that I was wondering what that was for
so we've got a little side which looks a
little bit scary because it's so small I
don't think I'm gonna use that today but
I'm definitely gonna be using the other
side so I'm gonna go straight up bowling
here we go okay so this mascara is super
super wet which can be a bit scary at
times now for my lashes I'm just going
to be sticking on these ones here from
Egyptian queen these are in these style
during to give a glam a and they are
 beautiful
these are lutely one of my favorite
pairs these are one of my favorite pairs
of lashes from Egyptian queen Beauty
they're super super super long which is
totally okay cuz that's what I like too
so I'm just gonna pop these on
off-camera and I'll be right back and
we'll finish the rest of my face now
that my lashes run I'm going to pop on a
little bit of blush this is the true
face blush in the shade
love flush so it's like a cute little
peachy tone and I'm gonna use this
little stippling brush here I love using
a stippling brush to apply blush it's a
bit of a tongue just isn't it though I
was gonna put this on the apples just
down here
sometimes I go a little bit overboard
with blush because there's just bronzy
shades in my face okay so last but not
least for my lip color I'm gonna be
trying out this lip color from
colour-pop this is from that I loves
sree sree collection and this is in the
shade naughty okay so it's a beautiful
nude color ah right up my ass I love it
such a good formula I love color pop I'm
sorry impressed with this color it's
like exactly what I love in a nude lip
as you guys know I love nude lids
because I drew them every single video
sorry about it but I drew it cuz they're
wearable easy to guard you know what I
mean now that's pretty much already dry
so just right over top of that I'm just
gonna take the colour-pop ultra glossy
lip in the shade curvy it named after me
or something home yeah just gonna pop
this gloss straight over the top my Tia
