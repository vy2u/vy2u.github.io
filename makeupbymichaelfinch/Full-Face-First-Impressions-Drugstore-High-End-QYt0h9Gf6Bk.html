today I thought I would sit down and do
a full face of first impressions as you
guys know or may not know if you have me
on snapchat you would know this because
I always post about it so I mean I'm
snapchat I leave it on the screen right
here if you have me on snapchat you
would know that I always get sent PR
from different brands and companies so
I've always got new releases and you
makeup and I've always got new products
coming in basically what I do when I get
them I put them all into a box and I
make videos like it there so today I
don't really know what's going to happen
I've got some drugstore some affordable
actually they're pretty much just
affordable drugstore here in America but
and then I've got some high-end products
as well so without any further ado let's
get straight into this
video and get glam so we're going to be
starting off with my eyebrows today and
I'm going to be using the la splash
cosmetics Corp eyebrow pomade I got sent
all of these colors so I think this is
the one that is going to shoot me the
best it's sorry moosie like it's not dry
at all that's right it's a very wet
product from what I could see so far so
I'm just going to put that on the back
of my hand with his angled brush and
just screw through on in there it's just
kind of like every other eye brow pomade
that I've used before like there's
nothing special about it
and it's clearly doing the job there
might be a bit wet for some people but I
don't mind that because I can really
make a new shape with my brows like I do
every single day in my life and I'm not
a hundred percent sure but I'm pretty
sure la splash is super duper of sort of
wall and I know they do a lot of liquid
lipsticks as well I've actually got a
lot of a lace flashes liquid lipsticks
but I've never really been a massive fan
of them hence why I haven't used them
what I find funny is that some of the PR
that I get brands knows that I am very
honest in my videos and they know that I
say what I really feel about products so
the fact that they keep sending them to
me is really really cool
ok guys let's get into the face this is
the Tarte pull of mattifying primer I'm
boys about trying new prime
it's all you put on your finger
literally looks like silicon that means
it's going to be good to fill in those
pores get that smooth base going on you
know what I'm saying
nice I feel so good honestly tart is one
of those brands that I fully love like
if anyone were to ask me what my
favorite makeup brand I'm pretty sure it
would be tired they just have the
biggest range of products and they're
constantly coming out with new stuff
which is awesome well that feels super
good on my skin and it looks like it has
Loki blurred my pores on my nose which
is also which is support on my nose is
disgusting okay let's do the eyes first
like always not changing up not gonna do
the face today okay you oh my god I'm
just going to zoom you guys in so you
can see a little bit better
hey guys nice and close now so um can
clr we're having a girl oh yeah I've got
this one here from Skinner ooh this is a
perfect skin concealer treat skin while
you wear it essential for blemishes and
dark circles well hon today I'm going to
be using a to conceal my brows because
why not
so it comes in a little twist up top I
probably got way too much product out
fine so I'm just going to use this to
conceal underneath my brows today it
might be a little bit dark for that but
I don't actually have another concealer
that I can use now I'm just going to
take some more of that skin out you can
feel are and just a couple over my lid
because I'm going to be using this is my
eyeshadow base today and I really like
stick applicators like ones that cut
like twist up ones like you just alright
I just feel like there's not as much in
there blending that out with my damp
Beauty Blender yes I actually could just
get off in weapons for a change I'm not
even that lazy today it's actually got
really good coverage though now as of
now I actually do not have a new
translucent powder so I'm just going to
sneak in some rpma because I just don't
have a new one so I'm just going to take
that on my blender and just straight up
in there
and that honors well thank you okay so
for my eyeshadow today I'm going to be
using this Inglot eye shadow palette
here this is then you warm palette I
guess there's a warm one and then as a
neutral one
it's am using at the warm one and the
colors in this are just like stopped
they're literally amazing oh god they're
all so pretty I don't know what shade to
take third so I'm actually just going to
take this rosy sort of burgundy shade
and I'm gonna put that oh my god how low
pigmentation hello yes oh my god I love
this eyeshadow already set that up good
I'm going to kind of wing that out I'm
not going to do wings today just to
change it up a little bit for once in a
while so I'm just going to take that
same shade just on a more dense a brush
just so I can pack on the Cullens out of
V in preparation for the next color
we're going to lay down color is so
pretty and this eyeshadow is so like
buttery and it blends so well like so
well so the next shade I'm going to take
is this the top line here and then
that's going to be it for the whole look
besides underneath the eyes which will
do out to conceal it and everything like
that so I'm just going to take that dark
shade on a small dense brush one that I
just used before I'm just going to put
it on my out of V yes and I'm going to
kind of wiggle it up through my crease
my packing packing packing on color
really just focusing on getting it in
there I don't even know where this look
is going to be honest I do not know then
I'm going to go back to that same brush
that I have with my first color and
straight back in with that other color
and I'm just going to go over the edges
of that darker shade and just blend
everything out and it's going to make it
look so much more intense and more like
gland which is what we want
blending blending blending okay so now
for my eyelid part and I'm so excited to
be using this this is the sealer
magnificent metal
a liquid eyeshadow in the shade gold
retro oh my god I had two clients
yesterday will they'll both my friends
and I use this on them both and I'm
literally obsessed with this product
it's so easy to use the consistency
everything is amazing I have not used it
on myself yet so today's the day
actually was sent all of the shades of
these from Mecca I do like to disclose
one send something or I bought something
so literally almost everything in this
video or actually no there is a few
things that I did buy but I'll talk
about that later
so yeah I'm so excited to use this holy
 you guys by the way you did
not know if you don't have me on
Instagram I'm actually doing an
Instagram giveaway at the moment I'm
giving away 4 different colors of these
all you have to do is go on to this
photo here on my Instagram page and tag
three of your friends and make sure you
follow me on Instagram and snapchat and
that's pretty much it you can win 4 of
these and the giveaway is
international ok so I don't want to talk
when I apply this because I really want
to kind of do like a cut crease sort of
thing so I'm going to apply some music
for you guys ok
are you guys seeing how easy that was it
was literally one dip of the product
straight out of the tube straight onto
my eye and there is a cut crease I guess
I would call this a cut crease it's so
easy to do that start easy to use what
I'm going to do is I'm going to take
that darker shade and I'm just going to
pop that over the edge of it just so it
kind of blends it together and the thing
that I love about these is that when
they dry when you put something over
them the shadow doesn't stick and leave
a mark like it does with glitter glue so
that is what is amazing about these and
that was literally so easy I just have
to fix this one up a little bit because
my eyes are so uneven like this one
folds down a bit more and this one goes
up so I was like I'm just going to take
that darkest shade again and I'm just
going to kind of run it across my lid I
mean just like really tight to my lash
line just so there's something for the
lashes to dissolve into sorry in love
with the Magnificent metals are amazing
okay so now that the tops of my eyes are
all done let's move on to the rest of
the face now foundation I'm going to be
trying the wet and wild cover or cream
foundation what it looks like right here
so get this a go
but way too scary trying new foundations
to be honest because it's like the base
to everything and if it fuck's up then
you're pretty much this is in the
shade light pale so perfect for me
it's very pink which is good you know so
I'm going to take a regular foundation
brush and I'm gonna start painting this
all over feel like it's not going to be
very good coverage like oh my god it
smells like broccoli what the hell okay
so I really do not like the consistency
of this I feel like it's just gonna all
blend away when I get my sponge I've
literally put so much on to get coverage
like I've even blended it yet and I
hasn't got good coverage
ah actually you know what everything I
just said I might have to take back you
know what this covers so well my bad
this is actually good but the downfall
about it is you need to use a lot of
foundation to actually get good coverage
so I'd say it's buildable guys while I'm
here I just wanted to say a huge thank
you to everyone who supported me through
everything and subscribe to my channel
and if you guys still watch my videos
and if you guys watch my videos it's so
cool we just hit 350,000 the other day
and that just like oh my god I've got
goose bumps everywhere like it just
bottles my minds like what the
never would I have imagined that YouTube
would be this series to me YouTube is
actually my job now if you guys didn't
know I don't have another job I don't
really have time to take clients anymore
so I kind of just do my friends
hopefully when I'm your super is when I
will be doing some clients cuz I do miss
doing makeup on other people you know
what I'm saying
yeah just thank you thank you thank you
can I thank you enough ever and I am
planning on doing a huge giveaway soon I
just did a little one yesterday the
Stila liquid eyeshadows just because
they're in height and I feel like
everyone wants them so that's what I
just do that separately so I'm gonna got
two negative things to say about this
foundation it oxidizes its oxidizing
right now a lot I don't know if you guys
can tell but I can definitely see that
its oxidizing super class the
consistency sucks like it's just really
gross putting it on your skin but the
coverage is actually pretty good and for
the price it's good so now if you
highlight my face today I'm just going
to be going back into that skin oh to
concealer I'm just taking my damn Beauty
Blender and blending that straight out
yes blend so good now just maybe using
that to conceal my under eyes today as
well it might be a little bit dark but
it's still going to work okay I'm going
to take my damp Beauty blender and blend
this all out oh my god I'm leaving to
everything that I've used today I'm
actually quite impressed with I'm going
to totally so what I have to I
shouldn't use the rpma anyway to bake my
under eyes and bake my whole face stages
is
again these Skinner troop a placemat
translucent powder looks really weird in
the packaging it looks like cottage
cheese almost anyway alright so I'm just
going to dip into that translucent
powder with my damp Beauty Blender this
is super finely milled which is a good
thing I guess because it's literally
soaking into my concealer which is what
you want with a translucent baking sort
of powder okay I'm just going to pop
that on my chin my Cupid's bow along my
nose bridge and also my forehead I'm
also just going to be taking that
translucent powder and just setting all
the rest of my foundation with it a Park
Avenue princess bronzer but I'm just
going to take that on my benefit
bronzing brush I love it already
blends so well and then I'm just going
to be doing underneath my jawline we're
trying to make a jawline as I say now to
contour my face a little bit more I'm
going to be trying to make a glow
contouring palette from wet and wild I'm
just going to take that on my ears away
by one to seven brush and I'm going to
take be a darker shade here and I'm
gonna oh don't know if I want to use
this
oh my god that looks so muddy I'm just
going to try and do a little bit under
here okay I really do not like this at
all I'm going to use up okay I really
don't like with that contouring powder
have done I'm just going to take some
more of that translucent powder from
Skinner too and see if I can clean
underneath that a bit this doesn't clean
it up I don't know what will okay moving
on to blush this is tart captivating
blush now I did actually use this the
other day but I didn't really get to
talk about it so I may use it again
today so just pretend I haven't used it
before you know I'm saying this is
literally literally amazing it will
match any look I feel like it kind of
like a dupe for like um features by Marc
or it just adds a nice flush of color
but not too much to not I'm saying now
to highlight my face I'm going to be
testing this la girl strobe light
strobing powder
I saw Nikki types to use this a long
time ago it's been around for a while
but and I really got a chance to use it
so I can't put my uh Nastasia
highlighting brush to eat up so I have
to use this this is a what a morphe e27
I'm pretty sure this is shining - not
mine so for watching this sorry bout it
self so I'm just going to dip into that
highlighter oh my god what the
this is serious I work on I think it's
working I mean it probably looks good on
camera but in person it's so powdery and
it's literally not blending out
are you serious I wanted this makeup to
look cool looks amazing on camera but in
person it's patchy it's and
it literally just slides off the brush
maybe if I'm just going to spray my
brush with a bit of mac's fix+ and no
it's not this brush that I'm using to
highlight because I use this brush to
highlight before and it looks fine now
nothing nothing at all you're joking
that was a waste of twenty
dollars woman OH
oh my god this is literally the shittest
highlighter I've ever used it's
literally just powder like I'm putting
this much on right and that's what I get
I can't even see it in person so I drag
you guys that is horrible I do
not like this one bit see ya now
I'm going to do underneath my eyes I'm
just going to play some music and speed
it up a little bit because it's not
really much to it I'll show you
now in my waterline today I'm just gonna
be taking the Marc Jacobs eyeliner
pencil and this is in the shade fine
wine it's kind of like a pink now I have
used these over four but not in any
videos I'm really impressed with the
formula of these I was actually sent the
whole lot from Marc Jacobs so I'm so
thankful because I will be using these
for the rest of my life
they actually wound up from the bottom
as well they don't have to sharpen them
which is a plus because I can identify
my schockner when I need it I'm
just going to go straight in my
waterline
Oh red in there I know done red before
well it's not red at the pink but
shouldn't makes my eyes look so green I
don't know if it's that just making my
eyes look green she know I look like an
alien I'm loving it because that
highlighter is like I can't get
over how much I do not like that product
okay reading on premise car this is the
grill lane la Petite robe new aura
mascara is packaging is absolutely
stained must add so nice but one's a bit
 weirdo it's like a triangle with
a ball at the top but whatever I guess
it's gonna let you get into those areas
that are hard to get into oh yeah that
ball is actually really helpful hmm that
was a bit with the bottom lashes
but I'm other than there oh my god ha
that's not so good now for my lashes
these are from a brand called eyelash
warriors these are actually in the style
cinch named after the one and only thing
yeah so I'm gonna pop these on
off-camera and I'll be right back okay
guys now that my lashes are on it is
time for the last step and for lips I'm
going to be using the in Glocks HD lip
tint matte in the shade 17 I guess 17 I
don't know but I'm just gonna check this
on mm-hmm I love these colors so much I
lack of the smell of these I smells so
good
okay guys that's pretty much it for
today's video I really hope you enjoyed
this I stand out some products that I
hate and that I actually really like and
the ones that I hate are going to be
going into full face using makeup I hate
