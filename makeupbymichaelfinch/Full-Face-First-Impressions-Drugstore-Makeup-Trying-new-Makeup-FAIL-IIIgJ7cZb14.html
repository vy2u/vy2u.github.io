channel so today I thought I would do a
full face of first impressions using
drugstore items only without any further
ado let's get straight into it I really
hope you guys enjoy this video basically
if you don't know what a full face of
first impressions is basically just wear
either I try prior I tried the product
for the first time and then I give you
my thoughts on it
so yeah let's do it okay so to get
started today I'm going to be taking the
Milani eye brow pomade and this is in
the shade 0-1 soft brown but so I'm just
gonna go straight underneath my brow and
then I'm just going to start kind of
filling in the natural sort of shape
that I have going on at the moment
lately I've been loving like big bushy
like messy brows if you had said to me a
year ago are you ever going to have like
natural looking brows I would have been
like no Instagram brows today is now I
just love this whole like brushed up
feathery real hair looking brow kind of
I'm still kind of doing a bit of it
insta brows I like to call it
so this brow pomade looks a little bit
orange so it's kind of it's going to be
soft brown but it's kind of more that
Orange II like what's it called Walborn
so named for burn color then i'm just
going to take an eyebrow brush and just
kind of brush through them and get them
back into place again over my brows a
nice an orange let's move on to consumer
eyes
now for concealer today I'm not going to
lie I have used this before but I do not
have another drugstore concealer but
this concealer I'm just going to say
right now is literally amazing it is by
went wild it's the comb correct
celebrity conceal others in the shade
medium golden which is this was the
lightest one that I could get on the
website that I bought it off and then
I'm just going to kind of like look at
the coverage of it and it's like sick
and juicy but not too thick and juicy
just how I like my men so I'm just kind
of concealing under that brow I really
need to get my brows waxed because
they're a bit of a mess
moment learn just concealing under there
like look how good this concealer is I
need to use that more often
I've got so many concealers like in the
back of my Alex drawers I need to just
like go through them and like dig out
stuff that I never use so I can give you
guys a bit of a variety although I do
try and change up my products as much as
possible except the tide shape tape
because you guys know I'm obsessed with
that ship that um yeah I'm then just
going to drag that concealer all over my
lids because this is going to be our eye
base for two dead now some take my damn
Beauty Blender and just go to town on
these lids now to look that concealer in
place I'm just going to be taking the
Rimmel stay matte long-lasting pressed
powder this is in the shade peach glow
very very light which is awesome because
that is what I need I'm just going to
set my lids with this and just a brush
now for my actual eyeshadow today I'm
going to be taking the meet matte nude
palette by the balm now I got this when
I was at the makeup Lacroix NZ warehouse
and I was looking at a before and I was
like something really sexual about this
palette anyway on the front of that it
says size matters and then all the names
in here is like Matt Johnson Matt Garcia
doing what that means but Matt Johnson
and it there's one the other bottom
saying that hung honey Matt hung that's
my sort of Matthew thinking we've got
these beautiful matte shades in here so
 I don't know what to do because I
was doing like a brown eye like I
literally don't know what to do this is
my worst nightmare so many video not
knowing what to do because I don't play
in my videos sometimes I just kind of
grab products and if you like yes I'll
use this um help
SOS thank you okay so I've decided I'm
gonna do I'm gonna do the sticky tape
method and I kind of want to do like a
smokey wing have I don't have a full
probably oh well but I'm just going to
take the shade this beautiful wide shade
here and I'm just going to kind of pop
that through my crease because I'm just
going to use this as like a
transitioning sort of shade because
there's not going to be much having in
the crease and actually I'm actually
just going to bring it up on my browser
so bushy at the moment I love it so I'm
just going to put this through my crease
is some extra powder to kind of lack arm
don't with me sticky tape that
looks a hot next to the moment but I'm
not except yeah I'm going to going with
this nudie probably a better transition
shade and I'm just going to pop that
throughout my
so we're gonna start building a whole
color you know okay once we've got a
little bit of something-something
happening through the crease just so
there's a little bit of
something-something there when I'm gonna
get started on this smoky wing yes I'm
just going to take this dark brown shade
and I'm gonna just start like winging it
I guess all the way across my lid
yes this is very pigmented and then as I
go I'm gonna kind of smoke it up and
blend it all up words yeah I'm gonna
take some of this burgundy sort of color
and I'm gonna put it even oh my god try
not to just get the whole part
in your eye it's gonna take some of this
burgundy color and put it super close to
my lashline yes this is smokey AF and I
love it now I'm going to move on to this
really flat definer brush and I'm going
to take this almost black shade and I'm
really going to focus this on the bottom
of everything so right up against my
lashline and also the Gerber can with a
little bit more Brown just to make sure
it's all blended tore out the top part
and then I'm just going to take any
fluffy brush and a tiny bit of that
brown shade and just make sure it's all
completely blended out okay now I'm just
going to take off this tag
okay now the both of my eyes are done
I'm then going to take this Milani big
bigger lashes maximum volume mascara and
I'm just going to go to town on my
lashes all the ones looking a bit
house one was this anyway oh this is so
good
it's literally done exactly the same job
as roller lash would do by benefit I
don't know if you can tell but I can
this look looks so weird
until lashes are on in your face is done
because it just makes my eyes look
really small now my mascara is on I'm
just going to go straight in with lashes
these are the Ardell professional demi
whispies in black and I've heard so much
about these and a lot of people use
these and I've never tried them in my
life so I'm Adele with the virginity
Birkin thank you let's see how these go
because I have been after a good
drugstore pair of lashes for a very long
time now have an i-beam D yes you have
Uncle Michael thanks teen so I'm just
going to sneak on a little bit of the
houses of lashes at black lash glue just
on the back lets-a-go tacky for about
40 seconds to a minute and then I'm just
going to stick it straight on my lid
okay it's been a minute or two I'm just
going to stick this on okay once this
lashes stuck on I'm going to take my
lash tweezers and just kind of squeeze
them together with my natural lashes
that's what I see as very natural
natural for me they're nice but I
wouldn't go for them okay guys now I'm
going to be moving on to the rest of my
face now that my eyes are all done I
just put a little bit of the Milani
mascara over my lashes to make them a
little bit more full for primer I'm
going to be trying the Milani Prime
shield face primer this is a mattifying
and pore-minimizing and it's oil free
which is absolutely stunning just
exactly what I need so it looks like
dues and I'm just going to take that oh
it feels so smooth oh that sounds a
really gross like that actually smells
like thrush pie not that I know what
that smells like that I could just
imagine okay I'm just going to pop some
of my forehead also to fill in all these
wrinkles as well there's any there but
meeting on for my foundation today I'm
going to be using the Milani conceal and
perfect now I have used this in a video
before so I can't saying this the whole
video but this is actually a different
shade that's meant to suit my skin tone
better so yeah let's go to channel miss
this is in the shade like natural the
last one I had was extremely yellow and
not all that great
so I'm yeah it's going to pump some of
this out onto the back of my hand
and then I'm going to get a paddle
foundation brush and just go to town
this is definitely more my color than
the last one I had I think this is a new
shade that they've brought out also so
I'm just gonna plaster this all over the
bottom half of my face first before I do
my forehead that's how I always do it
what I like to do when I go in with my
Beauty Blender I'll just take my Beauty
Blender take a little bit of the extra
foundation on my hand because I feel
like it doesn't take any product off
because you know how beauty blenders
tend to soak up a little bit of product
when you do that it's govern and I'm
just going to blend this today's yes
this is really really good coverage it's
like a concealer and a foundation one I
wouldn't use it as a concealer but
it's got the coverage but we can see I
like look at that the shade is literally
perfect my skintone and then just going
to start doing of my bull head and I'm
just going to run over the edges of my
brows not with too much products that I
want to like define them I want to keep
them nice and like natural-looking which
I never thought I'd say and then I was
going to take my booty blender and just
blend that out for so obviously some
drugstore foundations are just that good
I'm like why do people spend money on
client validations meaning why do people
meaning myself now for my concealer once
again I'm just going to take some more
of that crime crack concealer from
wet-and-wild and I'm just going to put
it in the areas where I think I need a
little bit more coverage especially my
nose because foundation like never
sticks to my nose and it's so annoying
I'm just going to blend that up my booty
blender does if you are in America or
you can get your hands on wet and wild
products I would highly recommend
getting the chrome great concealer
because it is just that good now I'm
just gonna go straight in with that same
can fill out directly under my eyes to
conceal the under-eye bags
Gucci bags okay and when I do like a
wing or something I just like to get a
flat brush and just go right up the side
of it just so my Beauty Blender doesn't
 with that you know okay I'm just
going to take this on here and then once
again just blend this does to set
my under eyes I'm going to be using the
Milani ghost set prep powder now this
isn't a loose powder so I don't know how
I'm going to bake but I'm I don't want
to use something that I've already used
in video because the whole point of this
videos are for face the first
impressions is that so I'm just going to
take that on my Beauty Blender and like
swirl it around in there and then I'm
just going to pack it underneath oh my
god I don't think it's working
I'm trying to use it to bake oh wait
there we go I just have to pack more on
ah
okay so this is not a good thing to bake
with because it's just taken off all my
 concealer under my eyes so I'm
going to need to have something save me
so I'm just going to actually go over
that bake sale date with the courteous
bone powder because I don't know
what the just happened and I'm just
going to take that all over my nose -
then I was going to take a big fluffy
brush and a little bit more of the Cody
s one because I don't have any new like
foundation powders I'm just going to
settle my foundation with this that was
really bad it literally I don't think
it's meant to baking but I was going to
make it work like I tend to always do
that but no obviously didn't want to
work with that phone and that's exactly
what this video is about it's all about
trial and error you know oh my god I
don't even have anything new to contour
with this video is a fail on a
self thought I was more organized than
this ribbing into bronzer I'm going to
be taking the Milani baked bronzer in
the shade Soleil it's like at just a
baked bronzer pretty cute just going to
pop that on my cheeks my god what am i
doing this is not a good brush for
bronzing this video is such a mess and I
really apologize for that so I'm just
going to bronze out my forehead my
cheeky little cheek brains here and
obviously my jawline
what jawline make one I'm just going to
bring that bonsai down my neck also once
my cheeks are a bit bronzed and
everything I'm just going to run over
the edges on windows with this now to
contour I'm just going to be taking the
elf contour kit and this video has
turned into a fail of first impressions
because honey I've used this before but
I'm literally obsessed with it it's one
of the best drugstore contour kits I've
ever worked with and today I'm going to
be using this shade on the bottom here
and I'm just going to go straight in on
my cheekbones because I need a cover
these cheeks were and now to contour my
jawline which is my favorite part
because this helps in the whole States
chinning sort of process and I throw in
a little bit over the edges of my nose
now this is meant to be a highlighter
this is the Milani illuminating face
powder but I did swatch it and it
doesn't look like a highlighter to me
but we're just going to hope for the
best and pray to God that it does I'm
just going to spritz my brush with a
little bit of the models prefer makeup
setting this and then I'm going to go
straight in on this illuminator
it's pink okay this is definitely an
illuminator and not a highlighter but I
thought it was actually kind of cute
it's like a blush and a highlighter in
one but as pop this all over my whole
check because won't not hmm
all these white chunks under my either
pissing me off now can I go it's so pink
now I'm just going to zoom you guys in a
little bit so we can finish off
underneath my under eye area I don't
know if you guys can see but there's the
white dots under here
oh do I get rid of these if I go to
wipe these off with a brush it's just
going to take off all the concealer I'll
just have to use the patch tool on face
tune for that one
just going straight underneath my eyes
with that brown color I'm sure I put
that right up against my lashline and
I'm going to take some more of that
brown shade just when I blend a brush
and smoke it down a little bit okay now
that my under eyes looking nice and
smoking gallon so I'm going to go into
that black dark brown shade and put it
right up against my lash line once that
black is laid down I'm just going to go
over with some brown and just blend that
all out now I do have a little bit of
under-eye bake left there I don't know
why I haven't taken it off yet I'm just
going to wipe off and ship this leftover
oh my god these white chunks are going
to get up my goat hard core for my lips
today I'm going to be trying the sleek
make up a lip liner this isn't a shade
of shabby shriek so I'm just going to
line my lips with this okay so I just
kind of filled my lips in that looks
sorry messy but this is planet is so
creamy and so like easy to use and then
for my lip color I'm going to be trying
to up well Matt me ultra smooth matte
lip cream in the shade shabby chic to
pick these two up in Geneva know the
same thing kinky oh my god this is so
nice they're amazing is strong from dose
of colors just a little bit more on the
pink side okay and this is today's lip
color it's pretty because this
highlighter is just not join me enough
justice I'm just going to take the sleek
Solis highlighter palette and I'm gonna
take just shake here and just pop this
one just so me have a bit of a highlight
going on that's Bella where it's at home
and now just to set everything in place
I'm just going to take the models prefer
sonali makeup setting mist and just
drown myself
anyway guys this is the completed look
I'm so sorry this video was a complete
 mess and everything was just all
over the place that that's what first
impressions are about really unimpressed
with this Milani transparent face powder
but I don't think it's meant to be used
for baking because it's not a loose
powder but that was my fault that still
had it now it's got chunks all under my
eyes yeah this is the end of today's
