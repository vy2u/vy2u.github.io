channel so it has been a hot
 minute since I have sat
down and filmed a video the videos that
you've been seeing in the past few weeks
were pre filmed because as y'all know I
went to the melodies with benefit which
was awesome and then I also had my birth
masterclass and I've just haven't had a
chance to film at all so I pre filmed
all those videos sorry I am back at home
not for long though I've got my hurt
sorry I've got my Adelaide and my
Auckland New Zealand masterclass is
coming up and there's still tickets
available so if you're in a delay or if
you're in Auckland
link down below to purchase tickets I
cannot wait to meet you all I'm so
excited to go back to Auckland and I'm
keen to go to Adelaide too because I've
never been there before so should be
fantastic
so today I'm just gonna be trying out a
bunch of new makeup that I've got I've
got sorry much my head is literally
about to explode because I've bought so
much and I've received so much over the
past few weeks and I've been away and I
just don't know where to begin so I'm
just gonna start it off I don't even
know let's get into the video
hey hey just gonna start off by prepping
of my lips with a little bit of balm
now we're gonna do the eyes first today
and for that I'm gonna be trying out the
Patrick Starr Mac eye shadow palette
this is the goal get a 1 now I did fill
my first impressions before I left go to
the Maldives and I used a concealer that
I thought up the eyeshadow so
from now I'm gonna do full face the
first impressions I'm just gonna stick
to using my top shape tape on my eyes
rather than using and you can seal it
because then I can really tell if the
eyeshadows good or not because it did
 up a little bit I'm thinking was
the concealer that I use so yeah so I'm
just gonna go in with my tight shape
take this is in the shade light/medium
honey and I'm just going to apply that
right to my eye we gon do like Diaz and
then you put on your black dias well I
can't wait to go to Oakland and just see
Chris again like I'm obsessed goodbye
now I'm gonna take my favorite brush
that I've been using to blend out my
concealer which is the Kat Von D number
40 I'm just going over to my brows
obviously I just used the benefit brow
products I don't have any new brow
products to try out as of yet but if you
guys know anything you want me to try
out in a video like this leave a comment
down below tell I'm just gonna take a
little bit of my Australian flawless
just to set that into place so you don't
move ok my hand seriously needs to relax
what is this ok now moving on to the
eyeshadow I'm gonna zoom you guys in so
you can feel a little bit better later
in my sheets hey there's always
glare in my shades whenever I use
glitter cuz I use glitter and then I
don't see the end of it for the next
like 10 years bye ok we're gonna go okay
this whole makeup room is an absolute
 show at the moment sorry bear with
me just while I try to find the blending
brush that I want to use um I get this a
well just the morphe m-52 one and I'm
gonna go straight in with this
transition sort of shade black yes this
isn't too big I'm pretty sure Laura Lee
uses this all the time for her crease
sorry but she's got bigger eyes than
mine alack
and my eyes sorry I'm going with this
I'm gonna start popping this into my
crease now matte eyeshadows I haven't
really used them before I used to have a
lot of them but they were literally all
the same color so I just gave up and
gave them away oh I wanted you to stick
you teint method
I had this ready prepared before I even
sat down do this and get this all
organized rip off wow that took
way too long oh so far so good these are
working a lot better than last time last
time I used the color pop concealer on
my lid and it just didn't look good at
all and I'm like I don't know if it's
the concealer the shadows so and so I
didn't upload that video because I want
to give you guys a true representation
of you know the actual products rather
than thinking it was this one it wasn't
super pigmented so far so so far the
stuff that's like this now I'm just
gonna go in with the Mac two one seven
and I'm gonna take the shade up here
this burgundy looking ass I don't
actually know if it's burgundy I'm just
I'm not going to describe in college you
guys you all know that and I'm gonna
just pop this on like the outer part of
my eye okay Oh dropship hat-trick and
I'm gonna bring this probably isn't the
right brush to be using thenews but all
my brushes of dirty AF so oh this is
really good as well just packing on the
color and then blending it out as we
guard I'm gonna change up my wrong I'm
sitting around with the morphe m54 one
and just do like little circular motions
Wow I'm already tired blending over
those edges with that bigger brush that
I use for my transition at is taking the
morphe m51 for again I'm gonna go in
with the even more Burgundy looking
asked Allah there is literally no
fallout
I don't oh and I'm just going to start
come on Pigman this is a really
pigmented I'm gonna bring this forward
my crease well I feel like a red mark
happening they're like what is that from
is that sunburn
so I've kind of lost all our other
colors just by putting that down because
just because I put you much on back
they're good they're working okay so
because the Patrick palette does not
have any black and I want to make this a
little bit more intense I'm just gonna
go in with the new Urban Decay
distortion eyeshadow palette this is
absolutely stunning and I'm just gonna
take this black right here I'm just
gonna be taking the extra Beauty small
blender brush with a little bit of that
black color and I'm gonna go in and see
if I can like do a little some some
looking ass crease to where I'm gonna
bring this right through to make you
know corner so then when I put my lid
color on the lip color pops more cuz
it's right up against the black does
that make sense this can be really messy
cuz we're gonna blend it out after now
going back in with that darker burgundy
shade I'm just gonna go over the edges
of the black just to blend that out a
little bit ever so slightly so take a
little bit more in my transition and
just kind of go over the edge cuz I lost
it there you guys I'm so glad every film
is the video because these are shows
were not working like this last time so
I was obviously the concealer during use
color pop concealer for your eyeshadow
base because it's fast not good
moving on to do a cut crease I'm gonna
take the light medium honey concealer
from taut diddly-squat shape but tape
and I'm just gonna pop this across my
leg and then I'm gonna look up look
around see if there's any day any Dix
yeah it's come back down and that is my
perfect line for my crease so now I know
why that's gonna go it's not gonna
crease at all and I'm just gonna start
filling this line in look how
easy this is you guys and then I kind of
just curve it down
in now I'm just gonna kind of leave the
end bit of concealer there and I'm just
gonna my battery's literally about to
 itself so right this doesn't die
when I'm just blending this out but I'm
just gonna touch up this concealer and
just kind of blend it a little bit and
then I'm gonna take the Patric palette
and I'm gonna take the shimmery shade I
don't take a little bit of fixed cloths
on my brush because it's very well
needed with em every shimmery shadow and
I'm just gonna start packing this all
over my lid ever so generously
now once that's done I'm gonna take a
little bit as the black and demo Rhino
all that's remaining on the brush and
just kind of blend it over that shimmer
shade on my lid
cool I'm gonna go change my battery and
then I'll come back and finish off the
side and finish off the eye look okay so
now my eye shadow it's pretty much all
done I'm just gonna add a little bit of
glitter this is the Too Faced glitter
pop peel off eyeliner in the shade yes
way I don't really know what the whole
peel off situation is about maybe when
you take it off it just peels off not
too sure but I'm just gonna put it along
like this part yeah because I feel like
it looks so cute sure it's really like
it's shiny and pigmented okay cool that
was easy love that now it's gonna take a
little bit of black gel liner and just
run it across the top of my lash line so
I really like the eye shadow like it's
super pigmented and super buildable that
black shadow from Urban Decay was also
lit for the tip clip so for my mascara
I'm gonna be using the a bad girl bang
mascara from benefit now obviously I
have used this a lot
over the past few weeks but seeing as
I've done my makeup so many times
literally in love with it no not
sponsored I do work with benefit a lot
but genuinely I love this so much
it actually shits all over the roller
lash although I still love roller lash
now the whole point behind this mascara
is kind of like the reason I made such a
big deal out of it is because it took
four years to formulate and the
technology behind it so pretty much you
guys know how in astronaut suits they're
really big and puffy like they're full
of volume but they're super super
lightweight that's pretty much the
technology behind this sorry and it
proves it
okay so now that we have that on it
literally feels like there's nothing on
my eyes like this compared to the Chi
faced better than sex which we've faced
better than sex is very heavy but this
is like lick riffing on to lashes I'm
just gonna be using these ones by Holy
Grail lashes these are in these style
and Missy love these lashes
they're so lit so I'm just gonna cut
these babies which in my size and then
go to town and stick them the on my
face pun hello it lucky blow your man's
dick yes that looks Starner
sorry I'm so obsessed
okay I'm gonna stick this one on and
then we'll get started on the face
finally I never full face the first
impressions go for so long cause I
always decide to do something so it
drive again every single time but I like
it it's done okay moving on to primer
I'm gonna be testing out the double 10
Thea instant and long-term sisley paris
primer I always see Jacqueline Hill rave
on about this this cost me 220
Australian dollars so it better
 out golden suck my dick at the same
time that's a bit dramatic don't you
think I think that's a little bit absurd
anyway I bought it because I've seen so
much about it so I'm just going to go
leg gears a little bit on the hands oh
it smells like mmm it's like a luxury
feels good smells good apparently it
makes your foundation sit on your face
sorry perfectly sorry I'm gonna put that
to the test once again once again no
idea what's going with my hair so please
excuse that okay guys moving on to
foundation I'm gonna be trying out the
dermablend professional foundation this
is in the shade bisque bisque smooth
liquid camo medium coverage foundation I
bought this when I was in LA last which
was oh so long ago this is how much
we've got makeup building up waiting to
try it out so I'm just gonna squirt some
of this onto my makeup table because I'm
a pig and I don't care about mass what
I'm filming you should see this right
now you should see the whole situation
I've got going on here it is a absolute
 show and if I want to try and find
my tweezer it's probably gonna take me
at least three and a half to four years
so I'm just gonna start by
- all over my face generously obviously
gonna go straight in with my booty
blender on a separately put way too much
on Bob but to expect anything less from
me
sorry Foss are good at blending out
really well in the coverages molded
medium all that I ever need it also
makes my skin look so smooth and not
like textured or anything but I'll show
you guys in the close-up at the end
alright just taking a little bit more to
do this big forehead okay so
this is all blended out and I am fully
obsessed and impressed love now moving
on to concealer I'm gonna be trying out
the color Papa conceal let's just in the
shade fair number five and I'm just
going to highlight my teaser in areas of
wow oh my god you guys not Coria was
sorry scared of me I like said hi and he
like step back and I was like oh sorry I
can't come down I'm babysitting not
really it's just 40 degrees out
there and I don't want to go downstairs
so that color pop concealer blended out
really well on my t-zone area ah
I'm really bad at looking in the
viewfinder I'm sorry sorry okay moving
on I'm just gonna conceal my under eye
area gonna pop a little bit of this on
top no pun intended to call it pop yes
honey
okay now it's gonna take my Beauty
Blender with a little over Exodus drop
to and go to town okay that is done Wow
coverage very good
okay so now to bake my undereyes and set
more of my face I'm just gonna be taking
the Patrick Starr Mac powder now I've
been using this for weeks I haven't had
a chance to film with it but giving you
my first impressions of it right now
 so good so good it's like the
Maybelline fit me powder but it's like a
higher quality version of it do you know
what I mean
lucky literally don't even have to dust
it away on your under eyes but I'd still
do anyway it's like a peachy undertone
to it so it's perfect for literally all
skin tones cuz it's like translucent
when it goes on so I'm just going to
pack that onto my hand I see you can't
even see that it's it's just literally
like disappears I'm also just gonna bake
over my nerves I don't have a new
foundation powder to try out something
with my hologram starless first of all
so you guys know how it is
and I'm just gonna pack this over the
rest of my face just to set that
foundation in place so it don't move
because that would be an absolute
show waiting to happen
okay so just to finish off the eyes I'm
just gonna take this transitioning
change now I'm just gonna take a little
bit of this maroon shade right up
against my lash line now it's gonna take
a little bit of the black from that
urban decay palette and just pop it
right under there I'm just gonna take a
little bit of that transition color and
just blend that down so unfortunately I
don't have a new contour to try out
today but I'm just gonna be going in
with the Tarte clay clay palette I'm
just gonna speed this pot off because
you guys know that I always use this but
I just want to show you the process
because I know people like seeing how I
get to the end result
sorry BRB oh by the way I'm just using
the extra Beauty a jumbo face brush
today to contour and maybe bronze we'll
see
okay guys so to bronze up my face I'm
gonna be trying out the Too Faced
chocolate gold soleil bronzer Soleil
Soleil and I'm just gonna be using this
on a brush this is I think this is from
japonesque gonna take a little bit and
just would I be as holy you guys
laughing I like it I'm just gonna bring
it down to like my cheek apple area area
where my hair needs to just grow up
because this is not okay and I'm just
gonna Brunn's not my jawline oh my god a
little bit my mouth it tastes so good
now to go a little bit ham with the nose
contour today so a little trick is I
just like to take my face powder color
and I just take a brush and I'll just go
over it and it literally just lightens
it and gets rid of like the look if it's
too much so that's just lightened it up
love that I think I gotta spend a little
bit more orange in my face there and
that the Chi face one is not orange
enough times to take a little bit of
butter bronzer from Physicians Formula
and just add that onto my cheeks
okay now I'm moving on to a little bit
of blush I'm just gonna be trying out
this one from Mac this is the modern man
to rain out some more orange tone which
I kind of like by lactose orangey colors
rather than like the more pinky turn
blushes it's gonna use the same brush
because it's gonna blend in with my
bronzer and contour anyway take a little
bit and I'm just gonna brush it on I
love so cute and fun fun it's gonna add
a ton of this cuz I love this
orange Ness you know only when people
use orange blushes they like to go over
with a pink because the orange is kind
of like a base for the blush but I'm
going with any
today huh I'm set on this okay I'm just
gonna do my bottom mascara with the bad
gal myself I'll show you guys in the
close-up how good it looks for bottom
lashes like it's so late
okay so moving on to highlighter I'm
gonna be trying out this one from
toothpaste this is the new one it's in
the shade
honestly I've got no idea doesn't say
the shed on it but packaging is like
very cute and Fuji probably not very
practical for storage but packaging is
cute I'm just talking for packaging so I
love this already it's like an
iridescent tea look I'm just gonna put
it on I'm gonna bother trying to explain
what color it is cuz you know I'm so
great at Dobb gonna take my morphe and
5:10 don't get to use my card I don't
even have one oh I mean it's super
pretty but I'm not feeling this vibe for
this look like for a festival yeah but
not for this look so I'm not gonna use
that but I will use it in another
tutorial
instead I'm gonna go in with my fave
glow goals glow goals by Ofra
nikkietutorials Club and just oh please

little bit of that on mate you know
corners I'm not gonna highlight my brow

bad and it will just highlight all my
hairs on there now for my lips have a
few products that I want to try out so
the first one is the Mac spice lip
pencil now I'm not gonna line I'm not

lipstick today I'm gonna be taking the
Smashbox liquid lipsticks this one's in
the shade got a light so I'm just going
to apply this just gonna apply this
around the outer edges like that then

impossible to take off without
up your lipstick and anybody got time

glam for today living through this grace
