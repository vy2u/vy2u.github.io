oh wow I've always been a huge fan of
Marc Jacobs products especially their
foundation and their bronze are two of
my favorite things from Marc Jacobs
which is the Omega bronzer and the
foundation I forget what it's called
shows how much I love it think yeah I'm
gonna change it is more sort of denser
brush just so I can really pack it on
it's gonna keep blending that okay now
I'm gonna go into this shade from the
other palettes how did I get darkest
little pink and I'm just gonna go
straight in on here and kind of darken
up this pinky target that we've got
going on oh my god these are blending
yeah crazy amazing go to the edge and
blend out that sort of line and now as I
take somebody's brown shader right here
I just put that in my out of the
so I keep blending that out
you guys need to try these I should've
held out they are sore incredible okay
now for my lip color I'm gonna be trying
out the in Joseph's colors ideal juror
in the shade mint mint to be answers
from the new mint collection so it's
like this packaging is like I'm dying
for it so it's got like a top part this
is where you put like this is kind of
like the base and then you've got the
pigment in here which goes on afterwards
so I'm gonna dip into the base and just
take a small little cute brush here and
then I'm gonna kind of pop this where
the pigment is gonna go
okay once that sticky pot is kind of all
on my lid that's how I've done it for
now I'm thinking that roping this
pigment huh
and I was gonna pack that straight over
the top oh my god yes
that looks so cool that is so cool
I'm gonna try and blend the edges just
with a little bit more of that darker
eyeshadow used before
I'm so impressed with this eye look it's
so cool and different yeah okay moving
that's the face I'm gonna be taking this
Tom Ford complexion enhancing primer now
Tom Ford is a little little bit more on
the priciest sort of side um I did get
sent me out from the meet other day
started to get them for free pretty much
so I'm well given me a super nice look
cooler to my skin now also for my
foundation I'm gonna be trying out the
Tom Ford waterproof foundation flash
concealer now this is meant to be super
full coverage then give it a whirl this
isn't a shade 1.5 cream okay that's
gonna tell them kind of smells like
stewed apples if not a thing okay it's
their coverage so far obviously I mean
naked just speaks for itself amazing

coverage is for nice now I'm gonna take
that same foundation and conceal the
tops on my brows moving on to the big
older the Jolly fuck off forehead now

used on my eyelids the Bobby grab one I
kind of just cut out as always when I'm
about to talk but I started using the
Bobbi Brown concealer to highlight but
I'm gonna change to this Tom Ford
concealing pen instead because I feel
like the Bobbi Brown one's gonna be way
too stiff I'm just gonna put that around
my nose true we're gonna blend out my

my face is looking at the right men I'm
so impressed with every single product
that I've used today that's like every
