channel so today I'm gonna be doing a
full face of first impressions I've got
so much 3 much I've got quite a bit of a
new makeup that I have never tried
before some of its kind of new ish I
guess I've got stuff from like k'kaw
Beauty morphe Dior cover FX Kylie
cosmetics iconic London cap on t bh
cosmetics so I've got a bunch of
but I really want to try out that I've
actually never ever ever tried before
can you believe I've had Kim
Kardashian's contouring kit since it
came out I still haven't tried it ever
myself so yeah without any further ado
let's get straight into it
first thing I'm trying out today is this
iconic London brow pusher now I've seen
this everywhere I saw Nicky do a video
on a thing that she loved and it's a new
favorite brow product so I'm gonna test
it out now this is in the shade fair so
on the inside it kind of looks like a
cushion like it's squishy and you dip
your brush in and it's meant to give you
a really good precision because it's
like kind of like a liquidy sort of
consistency I guess so I'm just going in
with the lightest shade and slinging my
brows oops as per usual so because it is
such like a liquidy like thin
consistency you've really got to go in
sparingly you've got to have a really
really steady hand because one little
mismatch will just turn into a shitshow
and we do not want that dewy but it's
giving me super nice precision and it's
covering all my brow hairs up as well as
the skin underneath
okay so brows are done and my thoughts
on this is it's actually surprisingly
like really really good but the only
thing is if you have like a non steady
hand or if you're not very confident
with like really thin consistencies and
like really having a really steady hand
and I would keep away from this but if
you are and you really like defined
brows and this would definitely be
something you should look into so the
next product I'm gonna be trying out is
the very controversial Kylie cosmetics
this is the skin concealer and I bought
two shades one is stone and one is
gypsum so I'm pretty sure I'm gonna use
the shade called gypsum because it's a
little bit dark I just wasn't sure which
one to get so I got two I'm gonna be
using this as my eye base but I'm gonna
talk more about this concealer when we
do my under eyes because you'll be able
to tell like if it's good
more then I guess and I'm just gonna
drag this all across my lid as usual
then I'm just gonna take this brush from
Kat Von D to blend it all out this brush
is so good for blending out your high
base it's just like sorry much better
than a beauty but now here's the Beauty
Blender I feel like it's
a lot of the product especially on the
eye it's pretty good coverage and when I
can stay I'm just gonna take a little
bit of translucent pan off and just set
my lid
that's concealed and set really quiet
nicely
okay sorry for my eyes today I'm gonna
be testing out the morphe debt to create
39a eyeshadow palette this is large and
in charge this is what it looks like on
the inside so it's a very versatile and
I'm pretty sure they made all these
colors in the middle here for everyone's
different skin tones to use as
transitions so I think that's really
good as well I don't really know what
colors I'm gonna use I will do the
burgundy I will do this one let's do
these and like this one and some of the
black we should do down on the lid no
don't look weird I don't know we'll see
what happens
all right so the first shade I'm gonna
go in with is this pinky burgundy color
just on this fluffy brush it's hella
pigmented Wow take it through my whole
crazy pretty such a nice color and it's
blending boy well it's gonna take some
of this transition shade and I'm just
gonna pop this over the edge just so we
have a little bit more just to blend it
all out with guys I don't really know
what I'm doing or where I'm going with
this look I'm just gonna play with the
shadows to give you guys a good
impression on this
these two shadows together they're
blending together so nicely alright then
what I'm going to do is just take more
of that berry color and I'm gonna start
building up this big man in my crease
and just really getting that color on
there by the way if you guys want me to
get a multi discount card let me know in
the comments below but if you don't and
that's oh gee I just thought I'd ask cuz
I've had quite a few people asked ever
since eyes like started using morphine
like genuinely like enjoying my but
let me know in the comments tell
pigmentation why's a plus okay so now
I'm gonna take some of this darker
burgundy Marone off shade and I'm
gonna build the flop over the top I like
to Pat shadows on first and then blend
them out afterwards so I can get them
into place so I'm just bringing that up
for right to the front of my crease so
it like is that like intense effect then
just going in with the darker burgundy
color I'm just gonna take a little bit
of that on a smaller brush and pack this
on whoa ah the other colors we have that
nice gradient effect I guess alright so
once I've got that down I'm just gonna
go in and take a little bit more of that
fast bagging to you that I used and just
blend around the edges of that was super
lightly like literally touching my skin
like a feather
alright so I'm gonna show you some take
a little bit of the black shade on this
little baby brush here and I was gonna
pack a little bit on keeping it out of a
write that then I'm gonna pack a little
bit onto the inner corner
and then I'm just gonna slightly blend
that out a little bit I'm just gonna
blend out the edges to make sure
everything is all blended in nicely what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take my flat
brush and I'm just gonna spray it with a
bit of fixed bluest and then I'm gonna
dip it into this beautiful like
turquoise see sort of shade all right so
I've just packed that on and it's not as
pigmented as I thought it was gonna be
so what I'm gonna do instead is I'm
gonna go in with this Kat Von D metal
crush palette and I'm gonna be taking at
this pinky shade here at the bottom and
packing that over the top bhaiyya that's
better than the blue like I like the
color more once that's just hanging out
on my lid I'm just gonna gently go
around the edges and kind of blend the
two ends together
I'm just gonna go ahead and finish off
it Desai and then we're gonna do the
face now I don't actually have any
mascara to try out so I'm just gonna pop
on some of the benefit of roller lash
the lashes I'm gonna be trying out today
are from a brand called doll face lashes
and these are in the style diamonds
they're super super pretty on my gosh
just taking a little bit of the House of
lashes clear lash clear I'm just gonna
pop that on it the bend then I'm going
to pop it straight on
fantastic lashes are now on I'm just
gonna clean up a little bit under my
eyes okay let's do it the face so for
private today I'm gonna be trying out
this Inglot a mattifying under makeup
base primer so it's very sticky and very
thick but I feel like I've got that
tacky feeling and it's really gonna let
you make up apply really well for my
foundation I'm gonna be trying out the
do ever perfect makeup everlasting we're
poor refining effect Wow
foundation this is in the shade 15 0
sustained I'm gonna squirt some onto the
back of my hand now to change things up
a little bit today I'm going to be
trying this with a brush this is the Zoe
VY 104 buffer brush because I never
apply my foundation with a brush and I
want to change it up a little bit so I'm
gonna do just that
I always dab one of these brushes with
foundation because otherwise it just
that's right doesn't run too much well
it smells so luxurious I really don't
like using a brush I'm gonna get my
Beauty Blender be a biggie right so I'm
back with my wet Beauty Blender I just
don't like using a brush I just I never
really have so instead I'm just gonna be
going in with the Beauty by now oh that
feels so much more normal
oh that's so much better
the coverage on this is really
good
Wow the coverage is Sarg lied so I'm
just doing the tops of my brows just
with the foundation now going in with
the beauty blender I'm just gonna finish
off my face and do my forehead the
coverage that I'm getting off this
foundation is everything it is so so so
nice and it has such an airbrush like
finish to it as well
so now I'm gonna be going on but the
Kylie cosmetics concealer this is in the
lightest shade that I got this in the
shade stone and I'm gonna be
highlighting and whatnot with this now
as I said in videos ages ago when she
first announced that this was coming out
I was gonna do a video comparing this
against color pop but some Christie beat
me to it
so she did a super super super good
review sorry I'm just looking at my
phone but focus she did a really good
review on the Kylie cosmetics concealer
comparing it to the color pop thing she
did like a wear test and a dry test and
all that sort of stuff so that's
probably more informative of a video
than I'll ever give you sorry I'm gonna
leave that link down below if you want
to go check out the difference between
color pop and Kylie
this is blending out so well and the
coverage is really nice
I'm getting really hardening out so I'm
just trying to fan on bare with me so
 hot it is in Brisbane
I'm shook to my call I did not expect
this concealer should be this
good it is so full coverage
maybe it's like 90% full coverage but
this is kind of like a thinner version
of the tart shaped cake for me I mean I
don't really like look into makeup
products like all that much to like look
at ingredients and like all that stuff
but like this is a thinner version of
the shape tape and that's saying a lot
it's just such full coverage like a
little bit goes a long way it's thick as
it dries it blends out so well it's
fully pigmented I love it ah okay sorry
now to bake my under eyes I have a new
translucent powder to try out I never
really have translucent powder powder
Lilla powders to try out when I do full
face defence impressions but I drew this
time this is the cover FX translucent
perfect setting powder in the shade
light I always see a Laura Lee talked
about this so I'm like I need to try it
out need to try it out so I'm just going
to tip a little bit into my the lid here
make sure there's no little creases and
then I'm just gonna go straight in with
my damp Beauty Blender I'm just baking
set all that concealer and I'm also just
gonna bake my nerves like I always do
okay now that my undereyes are finished
off I'm just going to set the rest of my
face just with more of that translucent
cover effects powder and I'm also gonna
wipe off the back as I've set everything
else
okay so now taking the k'kaw Beauty come
to a kid this is in the shade medium
because life is out of stock
so I'm just gonna pray this all works
out so I'm just gonna go in with the
core tone color oh yeah like the more
you blended out the more like natural
issue kind of looks so I've changed up
my brushes as well I'm just using the
morphe r14 faith for contouring ever
this is probably a little bit dark for
me but it's my fault because I got
medium and not like because I was too
impatient to wait till it's back in
stock but it's blending out really well
and it's nice did you guys say on I
think it was Kim's snapchat I think
trend red posted on Instagram there are
coming up it can feel up so I'd like to
see their formulae and everything of
that so I'll make sure I get my hands on
that as soon as that's on sale you guys
I'm just using this to contour my nose
and it's so good to contour your nose
with I could just blend so well and you
get smells good too maybe that's my
brush cleanup okay now for bronzer I
don't have any bronzer to try out so I
am gonna be trying the warm tone shade
from the k'kaw kit I'm just worried it's
gonna be a little bit orange yeah that
definitely will be so I'm just gonna go
in very sparingly with that I think it's
meant to be used as the contour but I be
use it as a bronzer is that okay Chi and
just around the perimeter of the jolly
forehead sis you know put a little bit
on my neck too because we need that to
match up I don't wanna have a floating
head do I it's gonna pop on a little bit
of bottom the star so once again I do
not have a new blush to be trying out so
I'm just gonna go straight in with
highlighter and today I've got the cake
aw Beauty highlight our ultra light
beings this is in the shade iridescent I
also got their matching gloss with it
too but I don't know how I'm gonna use
that but pretty much you just unscrew
the lid and then you just tip the
product
I'm guessing I don't know how this is
gonna go on the skin so I'm just gonna
have a bit of a play so I've just got
this on my brush and I'm gonna go in all
right so this definitely has potential
to build itself up what I'm gonna do is
spray my brush with a little bit of
thick see this pixie rusty there we go
you know I want that pigment to stay
yeah that's a nice quality or anything
that I don't like about it's like it's a
pretty highlighter it's kind of like
holographic it's got like green and
yellow and purple in there I think the
only thing I don't like about it is the
packaging you have to tip some of the
apps you get the product it's a little
bit messy but I've got it everywhere so
I'm just gonna apply small it's gonna
put a little bit on the tip of my nose
I'm just gonna pack some on the inner
corners of my eyes too I feel like it's
really gonna add to the look and just
finish it off
now last but not least I'm gonna be
trying out this liquid last matte
lipstick in the shade I move from model
rock oh that's not so good huh okay
the formula is super super creamy and
this reminds me of a lip color I used to
wear all the time it was called stone by
dose of colors but it's not dry or
anything it feels really really nice now
should I put some of this gloss over the
top it's gonna stay
oh yeah that's kind of cute alright I'm
gonna go over the top of my liquid
lipstick it with the k'kaw beauty in the
shade iridescent the lip gloss so the
gloss feels really nice on the lips and
it doesn't feel too sticky it's a little
bit sticky but that's always good you
don't want it subscribing around
everywhere you know and as per usual I
don't have any setting spray to try it
out except a new flavor of the Gerard
cosmetics slay or day setting spray this
isn't a shade not shade flavour mango
mmm that smells incredible this is just
a closeup of the final look I love it
it's so pretty the eye shadow is
incredible like morphe is like coming up
high to the top of my charts of my
favorite eyeshadow palettes because
they're just so pigmented and then not
letting me down at all and ever since
they've changed the formula on majority
of palettes and Jaclyn's I feel like
it's just so much better and I love this
look so much anyway guys this is the end
of today's video I really hope you guys
