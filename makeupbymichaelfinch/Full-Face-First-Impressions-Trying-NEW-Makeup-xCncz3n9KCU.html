today I thought I would scan and do a
full face of first impressions now
majority of this makeup is pretty much
high-end there's a little bit of
drugstore but majority of its high-end
so yeah I'm really excited to get into
it and use these products because I
haven't used them before there's only
one that I've used before but I'll
explain that in the video can you shut
up so yeah I'm just going to be testing
out all these products I don't have any
new brow products pencil eyebrows are
already done but I'm sure you guys are
used to that by now
okay let's get straight into it so I'm
just going to start off with my eyes
first and I'm going to take a little bit
of sticky tape because I'm going to be
doing the sticky tape method because I
haven't done it in so long and I still
love using this method so just a little
bit on that side okay now for concealer
for my eyelids today I'm going to be
trying the morphe concealer now I've had
very mixed reviews about this so we will
nervous but let's see for myself how it
goes so this is in the shade oats I
think this is the lightest one and it's
very messy
okay very moosie so what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to pop it under my
brow but I'm just going to take a little
concealer brush and put it up against my
brow to conceal it okay so first
impressions of this already it's very
yellow obviously not my forte when a
consequence ooh I like that white so the
base but we're just going to work with
it ah
guess what I forgot to wet my Beauty
Blender okay so I just caked that all
over my eyelid I'm not getting on I'm
pretty much settled in I'm not getting
up to wet this so I'm just going to
blast it with some setting Sprague's
y'all probably thinking Waterways yeah I
know but I just crab people are getting
up just how I am
okay I'm just going to take my damp it
Beauty blender and blend this out and
see how it goes
super full coverage it's blending out
well now to set those in place I'm just
going to take a little bit of the
dermablend loose setting powder now I
did use this the other day because I
have to use I really wanted to try it
and I am actually obsessed with this you
can get it in Priceline if you're in
Australia or if you're in America I'll
swear I'm pretty sure you can get it
online so I'm just going to more or less
fake my eyelids just because this
concealer is so thick but then if I bake
too much my eyeshadow will just blend
into nothing now I'm going to grab any
little brush
and just dust off the excess fake I
guess from the concealer now I'm just
going to zoom you guys in so we can get
started on the eyeshadow but I am going
to be using the morphe eyeshadow palette
this is the 35 I am pretty sure this is
the new one morphe sent it to me quite a
while ago when it first came out and I
just haven't used it at all because you
guys know I'm not the biggest fan of
morphe I shadows but this palette could
prove me wrong and change my thoughts on
it so let's see okay going straight in
with my eyes I want to do like this
smokey winged thing I don't know okay
I'm just going to take this
transitioning sort of looking at Brown
oh yeah okay okay morphe I'm just gonna
blend this color all through my crease
so I guys I just took a quick phone call
and I kept blending but I'm just taking
that same shade and I'm so
impressed with the pigmentation and a
build ability and the blend ability of
this this color that I'm using right now
it doesn't mean all the others are going
to be the same but like it's kind of
made me like using this maybe I need to
start giving some things a second chance
and a second go I'm not just using it
one something like I can hey that this
is building on so good and this makes me
really happy because I know a lot of
people out there do love more of the
eyeshadow palettes and they do spend a
lot of money on their morphe eyeshadow
palettes and I want to use them more so
hopefully this does justice and by the
looks of things it is so I'm very
excited for this makeup tutorial okay
now I'm going to go into this like a
burgundy sort of shade and I'm going to
pop this in my crease to like darken
everything up a little bit bringing it
up across through my little hood here
and darkening that arm now I'm just
going to run over the edge of my
transition color with a little bit of
this like lighter sort of shade just to
like blend it the edges a little bit
more because I select that other one I
use this too dark and that is perfect
this color is perfect for your
transition it's going to add the
transition over the top and that's
against the rules but I like breaking
that rule stay eat my ass come on morphe
shadows what the brick trying to not
swear as much guys because I just need
to learn to have some etiquette and not
throw um swear words around because my
disgusting factor thank you now I'm just
going to dip into this
darker shade here kind of looks like a
black I don't fall it is a black looks
like a navy blue but hopefully this
shows up black do I want to like really
get in here or just black shade oh my
god these are working so well I'm a
sticky tape and I'm just going to drag
it up through my little crease up there
kind of stop halfway like that
just packing on more of the black this
looks so good it's gonna put that out
with a bit more of that burgundy shade
yes love it like look how good this
colors packing on and it's not blending
away because when I first use them Wafi
pallets are kept blending away and I was
like what is going on like where's my
pigment art so now I can completely
different okay now for my lid color I'm
gonna take this shimmery shade here I
wish they had names but in the morphe
palette so so many eyeshadows it's just
not possible it's going to spread some
eyebrows with a little bit of the skins
and aeleus setting spray and then I'm
just going to pack this all over my lid
yes
this is like blowing my mind
and then just over the edge of that
color I've just put down I'm just going
to blend over the edges just so it's
nice and seamless now the most
satisfying part is taking off this tape
I would only happen to me that wasn't
even satisfying is this gonna be
satisfying ready oh yeah thank you I
love it I just got to clean up this eye
a little bit okay just one last thing
I'm just gonna take a little bit of that
black shadow and put it right against my
lash line just so there's something for
the lashes to like hide into because I'm
still really should it trying to hide a
lash band so I'm going to put a little
bit of black shadow downs it's going to
help it okay so moving on to the face
I'm going to be using the Becca
backlight primer now majority of the
products that I'm using in this video
today will some of them I went to makeup
corridor ends as where half and
literally rated it so I will leave their
website down below if you're in New
Zealand
it's a only shift in New Zealand but
it's a really good way of getting like
they saw morphe jeffree star the bomb on
a star like Beauty Blender Rimmel
there's so many different brands there
la go Milani so I'll definitely leave
that link down below if you guys are
interested so I'm just going to take
some of this primer
all over my face as per usual where else
is it going to go it's creating like a
nice glow on my skin and I really like
that can't forget this landing strip up
here for my foundation today I'm going
to be trying the Natasha - no no
foundation X full coverage foundation
this is in the shade 20 light beige
packaging on sleek heavy and sleek it's
going to squirt some of this onto my
hand then what I'm going to do is
describe any foundation brush and I'm
just going to put this all over my face
before I go in with my Beauty Blender
and blend it all out so it smells pretty
fresh it kind of smells like the lemare
foundation a little bit which is nice
because I do love the smell of that
foundation okay and I'm really glad this
foundation says it's meant to be full
coverage because that gets me really
excited now to get my Beauty Blender
into a little bit of that foundation
that's on my hand just sort of some take
the product off and just start blending
this into my skin wow I love the finish
of it it's covered up that marked and no
foundations cover up the sides
remarkable by Marc Jacobs
I know the marks on this side and you
can still see it so I don't even know my
own face how good is the
coverage on this though this color is
probably a little bit too yellow for my
skin tone but I always make it work okay
now just to paint on of my forehead yes
Natasha this foundations so nice I'm
keen to see if it oxidizes though
because that's always one of those like
foundations always oxidize a little bit
but let's see how far this oxidizes okay
just taking my Beauty Blender and just
blending that all at once again I just
can't get over the coverage and how
freaking good it is okay so I'm pretty
much all done with that now moving on to
concealer I'm going to be using the
morphe consumer that I used before and
I'm really nervous because it's so
yellow so shape tape might have to come
to the rescue but I don't know yet just
going to blend that out with my Beauty
Blender okay but it does blend out
extremely well very well okay now I'm
just going to do under my eyes and well
I'm so nervous
I think this morphe consider is five to
ten dollars
a blending out well it's going to take a
little brush and just run down the side
of my shutter so don't mess it up okay
just blending this baby uh-huh
okay so I'm really impressed with this
more if you can still the way it's
blended out it's not cakey or anything
okay now for my baking I'm going to be
using the dermablend professional now as
I said this is not the first time I've
used this but I might need use it one
other time and I was so impressed so I'm
just going to bake under my eyes with
this now the thing I really like about
this powder is that it doesn't leave any
sort of white cast like the our CMA and
the Cote the curly doesn't leave a wire
cast but the our CMA leaves a little bit
but this just blends away seamlessly
okay I'm just going to pack this fall
over my nose okay now let's just set the
rest of my foundation I'm just going to
be taking the Milani powder foundation
in the shade zero one shell and I'm just
going to take that and just generously
press it into all the rest of my skin so
this foundation does not move whatsoever
this conceal is pretty good it looks
like the powder or the concealer has
taken off a little bit underneath my eye
here I don't know if it's just out on me
okay now to bronze my face I'm going to
be using the Milani bronzer XL all-over
glow I'm just going to take a bit of
that and just go straight it on these
cheeks it's a nice Sun Tanning sort of
color kinda reminds me of giving Sun by
Mac now for a lot of my Australians
can't who can't get Milani there is a
website called crush cosmetics I think
and they sell like Milani la girl so
yeah go and check that out definitely if
you're interested in any of those sort
of products like they sell wet and wild
as well and like just different things
like that go check it out if you're from
Australia and I'm pretty sure Milani
does have a website in Australia so I
think you can buy directly off their
site but I'm not 100% sure okay guys now
I'm just going to finish off underneath
my eyes I'm just gonna be using the same
multi palette that I was using for my
eyes before so I'm just going to take
that first transition shade that I went
into it's going to put that straight
under my lash
now we're going to take a little blender
brush and just a little bit of that once
again the different sort of transition
shade and I'm just going to buff that
out whoo I love this I know it's what
the first might done a brown warm tone
look that and then I'm going to take a
little bit of that shade that I used on
my eyelid and I'm just going to pop it
on my inner corners just to give a bit
of a highlight on there yeah now for my
mascara today I'm going to be using the
Baywatch mascara from Australis and I'm
pretty sure this is one of their
numerous cars because I got sent it in
the Procyon a week so I'm pretty sure
it's in you so I'm just going to pop
this on it's just like every other
mascara I mean there's nothing
spectacular about it but it's not sure
it does a good job so the lashes I'm
using today are the atutor beauty
Samantha
lashes now I'm pretty sure I haven't
used these before correct me if I'm
wrong
pop some House of lashes black lash glue
on the back and then I'm going to stick
it straight on I haven't cut this at all
because I'm pretty sure it fits my eye
shape pretty well okay and then I'm just
going to stick it on
that looks nice what a lash yes
okay so unfortunately I do not have a
new contouring powder to is that
glitter in here
I do not have any contouring powder to
try out someone's gonna take a little
bit of my whole alight and just you know
go on in is cheeks and just contour a
little bit more the fact that if you
don't have a jawline you can actually
make one now it is incredible and just a
little bit more contouring around my
forehead area and I'm just going to run
a little bit of that what's left on the
brush just down the sides of my nose
because it did get a little bit lost in
the concealer now it's time for
highlighter and I'm finally going to be
testing out the Geoffrey start and mani
collaboration this is called Eclipse
skin frost so I'm really excited because
Jeffrey's highlighted before I've never
really let me down except the dark ones
they've only let me down because they
treat after my skin tones so obviously
that's my own personal fault to that but
yeah okay I'm going to take some skin to
Navia makeup setting spray and I'm going
to spray this all over my face and then
I'm just going to go straight in on my
cheeks Eclipse is perfect for my skin
tone it's like a nice white but I feel
like this would also look really good on
like the darker skin tones as well what
do we think guys
I just put highlighter everywhere these
days to be honest like I just don't have
a set spot for it I just put it anywhere
I want I pop up here it's quite a thick
highlighter like the consistency is
quite sick so you do have to really wet
your brush and apply it with a bit of
spray on your brush as well so it really
shows up and sticks that are there we go
come through
I literally just put the highlighter all
over my cheek and I'm just going to put
a little bit on my inner corners just
because why not now for my blush today
I'm just going to be taking the Milani
powder blush this in the shade key rose
and some take a Lulu that and I'm just
going to pop it on my cheeks
well she's pigmented which will just
bring a little bit of color back I love
flash I feel like it just tops off
everything yeah now for my lip color
today I'm going to be trying the bombs
liquid lipstick in the shade it it where
we think I hate the way they smell
there's my tea mint and I
eight mint color is actually pretty I
like it
by the public because I hate mint
okay I'm just applying a second layer of
this because it's not very pigmented but
when you go over with that second layer
that's when we're talking oh I love it
now I do kind of want glossy lips today
because I'm kind of getting sick of
matte lips I never thought I'd say that
but I just did so I'm going to be taking
the Bobbi Brown hide shimmer lip gloss
in the shade Bellini number fourteen
straight over the top of this it's
definitely a high shine one and now to
set everything in place and listen take
the skin tone AVR oil control finishing
spray and spritz my face and then we are
done anyway guys this is the completed
and finished look I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video I'm so impressed with
how this has worked out I didn't expect
a Natasha Turner foundation to be as
good as I thought it is and the multi
eye shadows has literally just astounded
me and now I just want to go out and buy
a hundred of them and use them in every
single video yes I love you guys sorry
much and I was singing all in my next
video bye see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
