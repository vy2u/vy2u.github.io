today I'm going to be doing a full face
of first impressions on it this makeup
look right here this makeup is actually
inspired by a girl named Stella I will
explain who's sellers in one moment so
guys I never actually explained who
Stella was the sellers actually discuss
a witch in bubble witch 3 saga who you
can help to defeat Gruber by popping as
many bubbles as you possibly can
I would just like to give a special
thanks to King at the makers of bubble
witch 3 psycho for sponsoring this video
basically bubble Witch Saga 3 is a free
app you can download on your phone it is
free to download so you do not have to
pay for it which is sick one of the
things I love most about this app is
that it lets you shoot these bubbles
exactly where you want them to go in
order to burst my bubble currently at
the moment I'm on level 10 and I need
you to see this little guy called will
by you so ruler is a little devious
nemesis right here and in order to
defeat him you need to shoot these
bubbles in order to release the trap
varies throughout Valentine's Day you
can actually go up to 50% more when you
buy one of the special bundles in bubble
Witch Saga 3 you actually need to defeat
him by shooting these bubbles to release
the trap fairy the bubbles that have a
blowing louder rhythm are the ones with
the trap fairies in them and they're the
ones that you need to like first and get
into in order to defeat your bar if you
guys have ever played this game before
let me know your thoughts down below on
what you think of that so as I just said
before guys a bubble which three saga is
free to download I'll leave a link in
the description if you guys are
interested let's get straight into this
video and let's get glam
I think I will get straight into it
first thing I'm going to be using is the
Kat Von D primer I have never used it
before not myself I used it in a client
on a client the other day in a clammy
okay I mean this is cavalries hydrating
primer and base which is stunning now
for my brows I'm going to be taking the
Tarte Amazonian clay waterproof brow
mousse and Susan the shade Tok Tok Tok
Tok Tok diddly-squat return
thank you stronger spring is through my
brow and this is very very evac I don't
know I really like this I mean what the
word is this is a very wet filling
product so I feel like it blends very
well but at the same time you've got to
be so careful because you don't want to
go out the lion in arms and
there is one Brad done I'm just going to
quickly do the other one now she can
still underneath my eyebrows and also
use as my eye base for my eyeshadow
today I'm going to be using the makeup
for about full color camouflage extreme
cream concealer by makeup robot don't if
I've already said that but I'm saying it
again okay so this concealer is really I
don't know looking on my hand it just
looks chunky and really gooey not loving
this at the moment so I'm just going to
pluck that local both lids because why
not and I'm going to blend that up with
my shampoo Beauty Blender okay now but
both of my eyelids oh my God my eyebrows
look dang can you step my eyelid into
play
I'm just going to take a little bit of
this pur pressed mineral makeup just you
said it so does not vary I'm just saying
over that carvalho special guest its
bender Oh every time being J every time
I told you not switch it more room ever
told can you go away people we're sorry
call me when I'm filming okay guys now
for the fun part I'm going to be using
see me at vida loca palette by Kat Von D
and have some stunning colors in here
now it's not going to be a neutral
tutorial as this tutorial is inspired by
Stella this we are going to be using a
legged just one that this one and this
one here maybe some of this blue over
here I don't know I'm gonna just pull it
all up in my eyes and see what happens
but I'm so excited because I have not
played this color in so long let's do it
first car I'm taking is the color called
squaring which is this a super hot pink
and I'm going to put this through my
crease and I'm just going to kind of
blend this upwards I'm starting to do
something different like I'm gonna I'm
so excited I'm just going to keep
packing that pink color on and blending
upwards until it looks absolutely
stunning they shadows already are really
really pigmented and I really like that
about them okay first impressions count
the colors in this palette of soy
pigment said they're bleeding they're
bleeding smoothly they're blending
smoothly and they're just stunning all
around which is gorgeous hello everyone
thank you go take a bit of the shade
called skulls and I'm just going to pop
that under my brow bone oh I just
sorry pigment I love it now it's going
to take a little bit of shade called
anthem which is this beautiful purple
shade here
and I'm just going to put that on the
out of V and I'm going to kind of give
this look a little bit of definition can
really just like bring it in and send
them to side
once we get a little bit of purple going
on in there I'm actually loving it ooh
much already
I'm just going to take the shade called
synth which is this beautiful blue blue
and I'm gonna pack that all onto the lid
this probably would have worked better
if I put concealer underneath but I
don't want to go near that makeup every
concealer again look at that this has
given me like Urban Decay electric the
you know the electric palette from Urban
Decay that's the visoreds giving name I
really really like if I was really
skeptical about at the start but now I'm
like to sustain I'm loving it
I'm going to take a little bit of purple
on that brush that I used earlier
throughout my crease and just kind of go
over the edges of blue and just make
sure it's all blended out and then I'm
just going to take that purple again and
kind of blend it into the edge of my eye
going over the edge of that blue just so
it kind of blends all together if you
are looking for a colored eyeshadow
palette I definitely recommend it I
shadow palette our sorry pigmented they
blend so seamlessly you guys saw how it
just went down I love this palette I
need to get out myself because I'm
currently my friend's house feeling all
her might off of this video and swear
sorry violet Johnny thank you but I will
definitely be going out and mine is
because it's so freakin good
just there sorry pigmented so pigmented
okay guys let's move on to my skin I'm
just going to prep it I've already
primed with the cat one day planner but
I'm come take a little bit of six-plus
best impressions of this it's amazing I
love it
obviously as it started what I love
six-plus you're only pretty much paying
for the pump because the pumps are good
it's just like describes the right
a product word in your iap squirting
your face anyway moving on to
foundations so I'm not canned at the
moment and all the foundation colors
that shiny has a tan so we've got the
infallible Pro glow by L'Oreal but I am
going to have to mix it with a little
with a litte let I'm going to
have to mix it with a little bit of my
Marc Jacobs remarkable in this glide
just to lighten up a little bit
cluttered up my skin because I don't
everyone will call me after that thank
you so I'm going to put a little bit of
port of load onto the back of my hand
and I was going to mix in a little bit
of the magic is remarkable in bisque
light which is like that yellow shades
that I've always use claude yellow under
turn for my foundation here and from the
go straight in port it's going to be a
bit hard to give you guys a first
impression of this ProGlide foundation
because I have mixed to it so that
doesn't really count so I'm just going
to skip my first impressions for the pro
glow and move on to the concealer as you
can see this is very yellow but I do
love most yellow foundations personal
preference people can say what they want
but I don't care because I'm just going
to do it anyway okay now that we are
looking taste and this is very nice this
is a nice mixture I like this just wish
I was a little bit more care so I'm just
going to take my Beauty Blender and
blend or our so I did a little bit of
shopping the other night on sephora.com
to IU and I've bought some new stuff to
play with and I'm so excited to grab it
and just play with it a little bit of
shopping on a sauce I've got some new
key Sony's I bought Genesis and
something something something about it's
got the way famous in a tab liner and
quali kardashian wears them or what and
they're oversized thank God guys this
combo of the Marc Jacobs and the Loreal
Pro glow is so frigging that nice how
nice is this
I actually love it basically because all
the concealers that SHINee has nowhere
as near last night and as bright as I
like my highlighter so I am just going
to go in with my touch okay concealer
and stand neutral now a lot of people
always ask me where I get this from
so Todd actually sent me a PR package
with some of these in it so that's where
I've got them from under my friend
so after I've been getting them from I
guess I haven't really bought them
anywhere and I know they're it exquisite
to alter no not in Sephora I'm pretty
sure they sell them on the Tarte website
but they don't ship to Australia
honestly it's worth the money it would
be worth the money it's so worth it
this concealer is just speaks for itself
just watch I'm so yeah sorry about the
confused once you find like a concealer
that you really love it's like when
you're just any product actually not
just as deliver to feel it's like a huge
thing for me foundation and concealer is
so important to me like I feel like they
have to be something that you well
because it's the base of your whole face
and I feel like it's worth spending that
extra bit of money on concealer and your
base I don't know that promise because I
can never tell if primers even work to
be honest so thank you thank you just
going straight in underneath my eyes I'm
very generous with this stuff I know
it's honestly fog or climb down below if
you guys like the touch so check
consumer as much as I do leave me a
comment cuz I'm friggin curious and if
you hate it I want to know why I want to
know these opinions why I don't know
many just worth different but you know
everyone but I don't see how anyone
could pick a hatred in this concealer to
sort of a day see what I mean it just
looks so good in love once I'm concealed
sort of guys I'm just going to take the
Kat Von D lock a translucent powder now
I watched Jessie smiles review on this
and I'm sorry terrified to use this we
could up my whole wall so I'm gonna
make that on my dance a Beauty Blender
here and I'm just going to pack it under
my eye because I will definitely be
giving you guys my honest opinion after
I take yourself I'm also is good and
looks mouth weird now this also just
going to bake my nose so they tend to
get really oily on there it's got our
own fog over my chin Oh Cupid's bow as
well by the looks of it normally I do
put lashes on after I do the top of my
eyeshadows but I knew I was using a
powder that is new today and someone
different powders can go all through
your lashes and just make a whole mess
so I try to avoid that completely which
I've obviously done now set the rest of
my face I'm going to go back in with
this I don't know if it's pronounced
or something but her pressed mineral
powder foundation I use this to set my
eyes before so I'm just going to run
this all over the parts where I have it
baked just to set all that foundation so
if really just went in onto my waterline
with the solid by waterproof eyeliner
and the shade I don't know if but as I'm
trying to find this registers do not use
inside eye while it's bit like about
intimate now hums while you use a why
have a waterproof eyeliner if I can't
thank you what oh my god bye
okay so I'll just finish off underneath
my eyes and I've just worked off the Kat
Von D translucent powder I don't see
anything bad that it's done I just
didn't set a little bit of concealer on
there properly so all this purple
eyeshadow x11 stuck to it which sucks
because now it's like right on your face
death so I'm not going to stick
start up a little bit and go over it
with some translucent powder unless you
guys can see hopefully not but I'll
transfer moisture learson powder amazing
I just chucked something about Too Faced
better than sex mascara on I don't
actually have another most cars here
that I can use for this video and also
for my lashes I'm going to be using the
Lilly ghalichi lashes in the style tease
haven't tried this style before what
I've definitely tried two brands one of
my favorite lash brands ever as you have
a discount code I will leave it down
below so everyone who is interested I'm
actually going to pop these on
off-camera cos this video will go for
quite a while anyway and I will be right
back click on tour today I'm just going
to be using the Abadi brown a bronzing
powder so I'm just taking that and going
straight on my cheekbones so I'm going
to be using this as kind of like a
contour rather than a bronzer because
one off that's pretty nice
going to bring it across my forehead to
try and close on my forehead a bit after
like contouring and Brunton just makes
all the difference in your face it
brings light like shape definition it
just brings it all back to your face
I'm also Center on a little bit of that
bronzing powder down the side of my nose
and a little bit under my lip yeah now
just to bronze up the skin a little bit
more understanding is the Milani bronzer
excel all over glow
yeah bit of a bronze look it's going to
give it just looking so pretty I'm
actually so happy with how this will
turned out living loving I love the
foundation combo oh my god Pro Roy and
Marc Jacobs remarkable means absolutely
stunning but lush today I'm just going
to be using the Natasha banana blush in
the shade sheer peachy nude and Sharlee
warned me before saying this is very
pigmented Fleur have a look these the
colors and started they are start
studying I'm just gonna take some of
these and somebody's she was right there
are pigmented so just kind of on the
apples and back I guess got a bit of a
glow to it as well which I really like
so my highlight of today I'm just going
to be using uh Nastasia Beverly Hills in
sorry Hollywood I've never tried I think
I've tried one of these a long time ago
but I've never used it in a video so
give it a shot
it's going to wet my brush with a bit of
6 plus uh-huh ooh that's really nice
it's not like chunky and it's like my
skin tone suits my skin tone right I'll
go of noise I'm just gonna bring that up
around my brow bone a little bit just
throw in turn to the side it's like BAM
thank you when then thank you man
getting sad my gold Trans Am
doesn't you'll remember that fun biker
shop wasn't really a single it's just
like on an album anyway let's move on to
pack more like highlighter on because
 not how to get that cube
inspired and just to nurse bridge as
well I love this hollow so pretty I need
to get this ASAP now for my lip color
today I'm just going to be using
colourpop's Gympie lippy stick it's like
a pink nude color
once a bowler and I'm just going to take
these to face sweet peach creamy peach
oil lip glosses from a new sweet peach
collection and I'm just going to pop
that over the top now to lock everything
in place I'm just going to take the
index and Jewess finish long-lasting
setting spray and just set everything
this is the Jewish finish I think I just
 step up I'm saying again just to
let you all know this is the Jewish
finish letting Matt try off so that we
have a guys I really hope you enjoyed
this full face of the first impressions
the foundation was definitely my
favorite part that like the mixture of
the pro glow the highlighter is
definitely amazing the eye shadow the
top of your eyes shadow is definitely
amazing as well and even the color pop
lipstick and the sweet peach let's walk
over the top it just looks so nice and
he just the bronzer I'm actually so
impressed with everything that I've used
today the least favorite things that I
use is probably the primer only because
I don't know if it's worked or if it's
working because I can just never tell
with primers because everything else is
so amazing I'll have to put the primer
in as my least favorite first impression
but it's the primer so you can't really
tell anyway if you guys enjoyed this
