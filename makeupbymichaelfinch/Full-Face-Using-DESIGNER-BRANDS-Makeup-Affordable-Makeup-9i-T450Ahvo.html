new videos so today I'm gonna be doing a
one brand tutorial using only designer
brands now designer brands is pretty
much just a very affordable makeup
breath you can get in chemists in
Australia I'm not sure if it's available
worldwide but I know you can get it in
chemists in Australia and a majority of
places so you might be a little confused
it's not actually designed a makeup it's
just called designer brand so the theory
is called DB pretty much I don't know
what I'm talking about so I'm literally
just gonna join my whole face using only
their products so let's get straight
they're starting off with my eyebrows
first I'm gonna be taking the extended
brow silky fibers brow fill out I guess
and I'm just going to take it well that
looks like the loving okay so I'm just
gonna pop this in oh yeah okay nice and
easy just naturally filling them in I
guess making a new shape towards the end
there and I'm just gonna do exactly the
same on this brow here okay now that my
brows are filled in let's conceal them
so true concealed I'm gonna be using
this all-in-one foundation so you can
use it as a concealer as well so I'm
going to take some of the all-in-one a
foundation off the top of that stick and
I'm more or less just gonna go straight
up one in here it's the perfect shade
for my skin tone by the way which is
good I'm just gonna take that foundation
concealer and I was gonna pop it all
over my lid because we're gonna be using
this as a base for our shadows today
over here on nicely and then straight in
with the damp Beauty Blender in the fake
tan hands so I'm just gonna set that
with a a little bit of translucent
powder both eyes obviously now for my
eye shadow I'm just gonna do something
really simple but I'm gonna be doing a
wing and underneath so I'm gonna do a
little bit of color on top of the eye
I'm just gonna be taking this yeah it's
kind of like a shimmery shade so more
let's just popping that through the
crease just to make sure there's a
little bit of something-something in
there I know it is a shimmery car I'm
putting it through my crease but
honestly who cares so once I used to the
crease I'm then gonna be taking the
absolute precision liquid eyeliner pen
and I'm gonna just do a big i'ma do a
big wing
okay now the both of these wings are
done living as my liner is actually
really good and easy to use I thought it
was gonna be too thick at the start but
it's actually super super super easy to
use and I think I've done a pretty good
job now let's just finish off the eyes
and get them done for - car today I'm
gonna be using the beyond amplifying
curling of volumizing mascara I love the
pink tube absolutely stunning okay now
that my top layer of mascara is almost
pop some lashes on now unfortunately
designer brands doesn't do your lashes
that there aren't something's gonna pop
some a random is on and then we'll get
started on the face okay now that my
lashes are all on let's get started on
my face sorry for primer today I'm gonna
be using the Rison primer luminescent
primer I'm pretty sure this just came
out from these guys as well so it's
failing you on the market let's give it
a whirl or it kind of looks like the
Becca backlight prime huh boss fresh
smiles
 fresh the ten hand sorry I just
can't and I can't even deal with this
rap bye
that has definitely given my skin a nice
bit of glory you know now I'm gonna be
taking my new fans of favorites
drugstore foundation this is the
designer brands luminous hydrating
foundation this is in the shade 802
classic ivory which is perfect to me
it's got like a little bit of a pinky
undertone to it and I'm absolutely
gagging for it
so I'm gonna squirt a bit of that on the
best squirt what am i American see yeah
so put a little bit of that on the back
of my hand here and is that a wet Beauty
Blender or is it dry what the fuck's
going on here okay I'm gonna go straight
into this foundation and you guys watch
the coverage you're gonna
everywhere so I'm gonna just start
applying it as normal like are you
serious this is a little joke but how
good is the coverage today like I'm
actually gagging them up start ones
gonna be applying this all over my face
and it smells so good it smells so fresh
and like nice I'm just gonna drag it
down my next to old matchup you know
next plural
thanks Lily I'll let not off you don't
had no idea what a play rules until
plural was until a few weeks ago now I
know Nick next you know when I do this
face next I think I was like a reptile
like a snake or a lizard or something
like that something a little bit cooked
and I'm just going to take that
Foundation and just conceal the tops on
my brows and then I was gonna once again
take it all up or not my big jolly
forehead now I'm just gonna take some of
that foundation that I used as my eye
base today and I was gonna pop that
underneath my eyes thick doesn't mean
that's gonna be bad though and I'm also
just gonna take it on my nose and my
forehead and my chin just running a
little bit of extra coverage you know
and then just taking my Beauty Blender
and Gerta town
okay guys serve just blending all of
this foundation flash concealer out
blending out really nicely my skin looks
really glowy look huh that's looking
good now I'm just gonna set that with
some translucent powder and to set the
rest of my foundation I'm gonna be
taking the affirming aged revive pressed
powder this is just like a foundation
powder I guess and I'm just gonna run
this all over the rest of my face just
so it stays in place all day and doesn't
go anywhere now most of us get a wipe
off this bake because we don't need it
really we're gonna keep the under eyes
nice and clean today okay now that my
foundation is all set and ready to go
I'm gonna be going in with the a
brilliant skin of bronzer and
illuminator juice or there's like a
highlighter slash bronzer up in here so
I'm gonna go in with this top shake here
just on this little dome brush just to
contour a little bit now I don't know
how this is gonna go regarding
blendability and all that so far so good
tip oh my god
okay well this is blending out yes I
love it when you get like affordable
makeup and it works so well it always
makes me super happy
yanari and time to contour the side its
contoured this side of my face
and it's not being losing a little bit
of weight my cheek filler is starting to
pop more maybe I'm just getting less fat
here but my cheeks are starting to like
pop a little bit more civilian I'm
loving it can't forget to contour the
jaw line if you don't have one like me
like I say everything go electro love
video under the bottom lip there now is
I'm taking a little bit modest on this
stippling brush and just like brush it
on just so it's a little bit more
intense
that was a bit too much that's fine now
it's gonna run a little bit of that down
the sides on my nerves also just to
bring it back cause it did get a little
bit lost in that can see a lot a gotta
stop saying that
what a adore Martha stop talking like
that it's on stop it
okay now that I'm nice bronze and con to
it let's take this blush here from this
blushed and highlight a trio I'm just
gonna take a little bit on my stippling
brush you wear and it just kind of
gently my cheeky little squats yeah now
I'm gonna keep underneath my eyes nice
and clean so I'm just gonna great back
in it with this beyond amplifying
mascara once again okay now it's gonna
highlight and I'm gonna be taking at
this shade from the same trio and I'm
just going to a drugstore highlighters
are starting to step up their game
hardcore like that's such a pretty glow
and if you wanted to you could add a
little bit of spritz on your face to
make it a little bit more intense but
I'm not gonna do that cuz every time I
do that mahalo dagger is patchy you know
it's a little bit on the tip of the nose
and the bridge and cannot forget to say
hello to keep it right here hey buddy
what are you doing and I'm gonna go in
with a little bit on the inner corners
of my eyes cuz I do that every single
video now cuz I'm just literally
obsessed with doing it now I was gonna
do and you live in today's video but I'm
gonna change it up and I'm actually
gonna do a different color so let me go
get one and I'll be upbeat so right here
I have a matte long wear a lip gloss so
I'm just gonna give this a whirl
how can you have a matte lip gloss who
knows okay I have not done a lip color
like this in such a long time but I'm
kind loving this different sort of look
cuz I don't really do like this but
