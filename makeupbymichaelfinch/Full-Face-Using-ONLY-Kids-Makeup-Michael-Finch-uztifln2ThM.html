sorry today I'm going to be doing the
long-awaited kids full face makeup
challenge now I don't know how I'm gonna
go purely because the products a pretty
much and I'm sorry if that offends
you if you use these products but um
yeah I mean they're literally like two
dollars from came out and then classify
this kid's makeup so so I couldn't find
any primer but that's about it so
everything else is pretty good so we'll
just go with that and see how we go okay
sorry my hair's all tied up now let's
start off with let's do a foundation so
we've got this love flawless foundation
in the shade dark no I don't think this
is going to be my shade at all I mean
when it's gonna hope for the best and
see what happens so kind of looks like
good coverage I mean I'm scared my
skin's gonna literally have an allergic
reaction to this and break out but who
knows umm now also we couldn't find any
Oh dry I'm gonna make it work couldn't
find any kids makeup brushes like at all
so sorry about that you know what I
never thought I'd say this about a $2.00
foundation but this coverage is actually
pretty good
definitely not my color but I think this
is the first time I'm not actually doing
my eyebrows first but it's been hard to
do eyebrows first when you don't have
really any good ABR utensils so um I'm
still going with some powder after and
see how that goes when I first watched
one of these I was like this is going to
be way too hard to do especially as my
skin is so pigmented and like kids
makeup isn't actually that pigmented but
this actually isn't that bad so I'm
going pretty well here as I said
definitely not my color but yeah this is
looking very Joey which is totally okay
I'm cool with that
but we can find any concealer to
highlight with because kids don't
generally have concealer sorry your
thing so this is a lot of shade of
foundation and the reason why I use the
dark one is because then if I use this
one and I won't be able to highlight at
all we all know my lot of strong
highlight sorry this is the same brand
this was
as well and I'm just gonna be
highlighting my you know high points in
my face
okay I'm just going to go straight in
for it I thought this is not gonna end
well guys this is not gonna end well at
all but this really brings out the pause
in like your whole face like you can
really see these pores happening up in
here Konya okay so I'm really just
plugged out in all the areas of my face
where I'm highlighting the areas and I'm
just going to do a few a little bit of
crossing my eyelids just to like prime
for the shadow today and I really don't
know how this eyeshadow is gonna go I
just hope it really wax up I'm going to
take my a Beauty Blender again and
attempt to blend this out that actually
doesn't look that bad a wait until the
powder goes on though that's gonna be a
whole new story now they're going to
pull it off or it's gonna go patchy now
to bank my under-eye say we all know I
love to bake so I've actually got this
long face powder this is also from Kmart
and it's quite a light shade so what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to scratch
them off with the end of a sharp object
so it turns into like a loose powder so
I can bake under my eyes I don't know if
it's gonna be better or worse to do this
but I'm just gonna give it a shot and
see what happened so I'm just going to
dip in with my Beauty Blender straight
onto that and pack it on under my eyes
that looks pretty good to me
I think that's work quite well actually
I'm also just going to be taking a
little bit more of that powder and just
popping it over my highlighted teeth own
areas now she said the rest of my face
this is like a darker sort of face
powder this is the brand love I don't
even know and I'm just going to set the
rest of my foundation with this and hope
for the best that's actually all this
tutorial tutorial challenge is going to
be me saying and hope for the best
let's just hope the end result is
somewhat presentable face feels start
disgusting like it just feels
yeah actually bronze and I guess contour
my face a little bit I'm gonna be using
it this be indulge bronzer this is also
from Kmart something take a little bit
of this then once again hope for the
 best
what the that is literally a hot
red bronzer what even happened to the
foundation down here it's literally gone
- what the
I'm not kidding as a so much harder than
I thought it would be Oh shitty ass dick
how's it looking guys back at home
how's it looking it's gonna run this
bronzer all down my neck so it kind of
matches up with my horrific ly matched
foundation I feel like this is kind of
like a nice bronze it's very ooh I'm
gonna kind of take that back I'm
actually going to take that bronzer
again and see if I can crunch all out
the sides of my nose just slightly well
don't look as you know monstrous and
Shrek ish do the eyebrows right
now bindi I mean LBD five let's move on
to my eyebrows and we're gonna be using
the bowl cutter brow powder I feel like
I've got quite a bit of a good feeling
about this one
you know I'm going to take the lightest
shade out of this tap her off you know
give her a tap tap tap a and I'm just
actually I need to brush these eyebrows
first so we have a kids I brush here by
brow brush mean I'm so happy you're
learning like Nia's like beer I was
going with that a lighter shade at the
front of my eyebrow okay guys so I'll
just zoom G in a little bit so you can
see a touch better don't know if you
really want to be up close when it's
this challenge going down but I mean
deal with it just the closer the better
you know I was going to going with the
darker shade rockier and kind of just
pop it along kind of a bad feeling about
this now I feel like it's just gonna
turn to like she's gonna change my
brush up and get a smaller one just to
drink the edge the end part of my brow
no it's not very pigmented so the end of
my eyebrow is kind of looking a little
bit up but I mean that's fine we
can just go with that then eyebrow
doesn't look that bad doesn't okay I'm
just gonna do this
try and get it as even as I can just
remember I wasn't meant to be sisters
and no mother popping twins is a problem
enosis brows that I've done in quite a
while to be honest I mean take a look at
this not too bad so actually pretty
impressed with how my eyebrows have
turned out just using this little this
little baby right here we go to Ikea
Latvia this far off with my eyes I'm
just going to be going back into that
being indulge abroad life's cutting is
it's like a bit of a transition going on
up in here you know I'm saying and I was
going to be dipping into that and I'm
just going to be sweeping that into my
crease area so I was going to keep it
blending that out and this bronzer is
actually burning out quite nicely
actually so pretty impressed this way to
do a shadows though that is gonna be
where the real hustle starts I can
already feel it in me waters but I
shadow that I'm kind of working with
today is this piece of right here
with no black in there I'm just going to
going in with this darker brown color
right here I'm gonna just be placing
that on the out of it be not working or
is it not yeah I feel like it's working
somewhat working okay so I'm just going
to be putting that all through my crease
area and kind of pulling it through it's
actually working quite well you know I'm
not complaining about this I'm just
taking that brush that I used before
with the bronzer on it just to blend out
that darker brown color that I've just
laid down and they are thee now moving
on to my under eyes today I'm going to
be going back with it that bronzer once
again and just taking a little bomb and
I'm just going to go in with that I'm
just going to go straight on in under my
eye because I was so hard to do this and
talk at the same time if you've tried it
you know what I mean and I was going to
be blending that bronzer down a little
bit just just smoke out that lower
lashline so yeah just finishing off the
under eye area I'm just going to be
taking a little flat top brush and a
darker shade of brown once again and I'm
just going to be going in my lower lash
line with that now I'm going to be doing
a winged liner today using at this love
felt tip eyeliner black pen and this is
also from Kmart
that is what it's like wish me luck so
I'm just going to go straight in for the
jugular with this and I'm not gonna talk
so just bear with me guys
I'm actually pretty impressed with how
that eyeliner looks now to get the other
one even is going to be where older is
downhill
Indy stop talking now oh I that
up so bad
this felt tip liner is probably one of
the blackest eyeliners are ever use I'm
actually really impressed with this and
I keep this one and user followed up
most users to take this a black tip felt
ladder and run it through my waterline
and kind of underneath I hope it doesn't
get me like a reaction because it is a
two dollar liner but it should be okay
you know what that line is still a bit
wet I'm just going to see if I can blend
it down a little bit so I'm pretty sure
that is the best we're going to get with
the eyeliner today it kind of feels a
little bit weird in my waterline a
polished and done it but it's for the
video so who cares
so now for the sky this is also from
being dull let's see how this baby girl
this car is not actually that bad for
however much it was I came in that pack
there was like 10 15 dollars it's
actually not that bad to my eyelashes
today kids obviously don't really have
eyelashes but I store and I put them on
because can't go a look without lashes
so I was going to throw these on and
I'll be right back this is the blush I'm
going to be using this is from being
indulged as well it's basically all from
being indulged and I'm sort of going
with a ton of that because I know I
won't be pigmented at all and I mean I
guess right put that on the apples of my
cheeks and kind of bring it back so last
thing I need to do today is my lips and
this is some shitty lip gloss that I
found in Kmart once again so couldn't
find a lip liner or anything so it's
ready for the jugular
this is going to be so gross my god the
color is rank
don't like this at all now I would
obviously use settings very true but
couldn't find any of that in the kids
section either so this is what we got so
this is the final finished look I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and that
it's somewhat entertaining if you did
