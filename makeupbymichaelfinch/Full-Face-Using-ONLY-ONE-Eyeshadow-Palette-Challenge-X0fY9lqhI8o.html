channel so today I'm gonna be doing a
another full face challenge so today I'm
gonna be doing a full face using only
one palette now this is not my idea at
all I know quite a few people on YouTube
have done this um the first person I saw
do this was Sylvia Gani so I will leave
her link it down below for her video if
you want to go check it out but today
I'm gonna be doing my full face
literally my whole entire face using
only the Jaclyn hill palette so I'm
gonna be doing foundation contouring
lips everything with this and I want it
to look as best as possible
wish me luck because I'm gonna need it
now the only two things that I will be
using today that are not a shadow is
moisturizer which I've just gone and
done so my face is just a little bit
moisturized it's pretty much dry already
and fix+ to make the shadows a little
bit more intense but other than that
that's literally it
and I feel like that's totally
acceptable and okay to do for a
challenge like this if you wanted to
look remotely good so let's do it
so I'm gonna be starting off with my
eyes today as per usual and I'm just
gonna be taking this brush here and I'm
gonna be dipping into it see Jacqueline
talent it is a bit of a mess but please
excuse that because that just shows a
good fucking palette okay alright so the
first car I'm gonna be taking is just
this nude sandy sort of color and I'm
gonna be putting this across and where I
this is gonna be is like they can seal
off so I'm just gonna buff this in - it
sucks that there's no like white barn
colors in this palette that is but
there's like a shimmery one and that
just won't work that'll just be like a
full face using highlighter huh and we
don't want that
alright so I'm gonna be using this color
as my eye base today and I truly do
believe that I can make this somewhat
work to an extent
and low-key make it kind of wearable so
wish me luck it might take me three
hours it might take me 24 let's just do
it and just pray so for my brows I'm
just gonna be taking this cool toned
brown shade
yeah good as it is carefully because you
can't really conceal the brows as such I
mean you can try but I don't think
that's gonna work very well huh I'm
gonna take some of this darker Brown
here on the edge I'm just gonna try
wetting my butt a little brush with some
fix less lip and then I'm gonna dip in a
jar whenever on this palette cuz it's
like my face gonna bring some of the
darker shade down to the front of my
brow you know close out the mirror so I
can really get up in my shit
all right so I'm pretty impressed with
this brow my god my eyes just saw red
and lighting so much cuz I literally got
no sleep at all last night I couldn't
get to sleep in like 6 o'clock cause I
stayed up editing a video and I just got
myself over tired so you know so this is
actually working quite well I know some
people do use eyeshadow to fill their
browsing and it's totally fine alright
so this brow is relatively filled in
quite nice I'm just gonna brush the
hairs oh it's actually a nice brown it's
a little bit like orange but that's fine
because it matches my regrow Cameron's
gonna do this brow and then we'll be
right back both of my brows is done and
I'm actually living for these brows um
excuse me thank you a lot I love them
they look shun ABS John AB did sir
no oh we're gonna start on the eyeshadow
know I don't know how it's actually
gonna go considering I haven't put down
like a seamless base or anything like
that because I'm used to having like a
full-on you know fuck off like conceal a
touch kick up in here base but look I
don't think that was gonna happen today
Han because we're only using eyeshadow
but what can't make it work I feel like
work you guys like I'm just really
excited I shudder oh this is gonna be
bum fuck all hazy I'm pretty sure is
that oh um okay let's go him at this
orange shade and this blending brush you
bitch wanna party with cardi cutting a
buddy in Harare diamonds all love with
my buddy Shannon oh love him up buddy
cut he got your bitch on Molly hey okay
I'm switching up my brushes because that
was just absolutely off its chops and
I've had enough please apply really
nicely without the UM concealer base
this just really proves how pigmented
eyeshadows are if they don't need like a
concealer on eye base I've literally
just got on the eye shadow before this
and check it out quiet far okay now I'm
gonna go in with this darker brown color
it's absolutely fucking stunning it's
like a warm brown
and I'm obsessed and I've had enough I'm
gonna take a little bit of this my Ryan
burgandy whatever the fuck it is shade
and I blend that in with a so feel like
it just feels a little little gaps and
I'm just this is actually the best my
eye shutter has ever applied with this
palette without concealer Wow Wow
I'm just gonna take the black shutter
and I'm just gonna pop a little bit of
that on the outer V for seconds and then
take the brush that I was using just
before and just blend out the edges of
the black now just taking a flat brush
I'm just gonna spritz my before rush
with a bit of fix plus I think it's
totally okay to use the fix plus and a
little bit of moisturizer before you go
in otherwise it's just gonna like not
work I don't think so I think that's
okay and if that's not part of the rolls
well bitch I break the rules
so hello right now I'm just gonna go in
aware this like gold I haven't actually
used this shake before I don't think oh
my god Jacqueline you need to stop what
you're doing right now because I've had
enough oh my god oh my god if that
fucking machinery doesn't shut it I'm
literally about to blur the fuck off
right I'm just gonna take my little
blending brush and just blend around the
edges of the gold now I'm not gonna do a
wing because fuck that I'm just gonna be
taking this little flat brush and the
black color from the shadow palette and
I'm gonna dip it into a little bit of
fix plus I've just squirted some fix+
on my table here by the way just to
avoid spraying it every single time
because I'm so lazy and I'm just dipping
it into the black shadow to kind of make
it like a bit of a gel like I'm just
gonna use this as a line who blown well
I was into because you can't do a look
without lashes on at the end you know
you can stop there if you really want to
be that cooked with the challenge but
now please skip this step but I refuse
to do this makeup look without mascara
and lashes on so I'm just gonna pop some
mascara and some lashes on and then
we're gonna do the skin with a shadow
okay so now I'm gonna be going in with
the color that I used for my eye base
and a little bit of the highlight shade
which is the shimmery shade because I
want it to add a little bit more
coverage
and this is gonna be my foundation we
have a lot of work to do and I might be
here for a while you know what might
move really good if I change the brush
size up a little bit so I'm literally
just gonna be covering my whole face in
the shadow and I hope I don't use it a
whole lot because I love this shade as a
transition but it's it's working it's
it's probably not my skin tone but if I
had a little bit of tan on it would be
fine so I'm just gonna speed this part
up because I don't want to bore you guys
but you can watch the whole process
packing all this onto my face let's go
okay so that is my foundation are pretty
much done this is pretty much the
easiest thing I've ever had to blend out
and it's pretty much my say pretty much
again Michael ID its I was gonna say
pretty much it looks like my foundation
color when I'm ten anyway so it looks
kind of normal to me
fantastic now conceal a time shit I
didn't think this through Jacqueline you
should put a barn white color in here
because I've had enough not kidding
alright sorry can you uh um look I
really don't know oh gosh what's doing
this sitch I'm gonna swatch these two
and see alright that's cool I'm gonna go
in with the shimmery white sort of color
and I'm just gonna kind of mix it with
the foundation color that I used and I'm
gonna kinda oh oh okay I'm just gonna go
in very sparingly with that and a little
bit of the foundation color you know
what I think I'm just gonna go in with
the foundation color that I was using
the whole time sorry foundation color
alright what I'm gonna do
that doesn't look too bad so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna put down at the
shimmery shade first to highlight so
it's gonna look really crazy and intense
but I'm gonna use it to like kind of use
as a base and then I'm gonna go over the
top of it with the foundation color that
I used all over my face to kind of turn
it down but it's still got that
brightness under there fuck I'm so good
so the brighter I make it I guess the
more intense it's gonna be perhaps so to
really get coverage okay so I'm gonna
leave it at that and then I'm gonna take
the brush I used before with the
foundation color and go over the top of
that packing quite a bit of the
foundation color on
she really that's nice oh my god that
actually fucking wax this is sorry fine
this is sorry cool because you get to
like play with the makeup and like like
for example like put that down and then
put that over you get to like play with
the makeup do you know what I mean this
is sorry fucking epic
are you kidding yeah oh my god that
looks so good I'm just gonna keep adding
more of the foundation color because it
makes it look more matte obviously it's
covering up the shimmer shade oh my god
I'm so excited to upload this I hope you
guys are enjoying this video oh gosh
that's a lot all right so I'm just going
to go in with shimmery shade under my
eyes and then going back in with this
brush and the foundation shade and just
packing it on probably this is working
it's kind of like a plane can feel a bit
in a shadow form I cannot believe this
worked so now we've got does that look a
bit more intense on this side gonna add
more of the foundation powder color okay
now I'm gonna go in with the shimmery
shade pretty much like on my forehead in
everywhere else where I would normally
highlight and then I'm gonna do the same
thing and go over it with the powder to
kind of turn it down but this gives like
the brightness and I feel like it gives
the coverage as well I'm gonna do it on
my chin and my Cupid's bow now I'm just
gonna go over it with the foundation
color again oh my god this just um I
shadow is halfway through as you're
hitting pan now I need a new one anyway
I just want a new one I want 20,000 of
these alright so now that my face is
nice and concealed it looks really Joey
- which I'm kind of liking so I'm gonna
go ahead and finish off my under eyes
I'm just gonna turn the fan on cuz I'm
getting a little bit hot right now
because it's fucking hot embrace been
with the weather and I'll be right back
but just watch
do like this guess what it's my whole
face using only eyeshadow so I used this
shake here for my foundation all over
and then I put this one is concealed and
then went over with this and it looks
like sorry would like it looks so doing
okay deadly serious how good is that
underneath my eyes and out done so it's
time to contour so I'm gonna be using
this little brush here actually knowing
fuck that I'm gonna use this BH
Cosmetics one and I'm gonna take like
the cool turn of brown shade of the
pallet this one it just yeah all right
guys I'm fuckin shook over this whole
thing like this is so fun so this is
more like a cult own sort of Brown to
really get that she's one sorta look you
know this is fuckin lip I'm not getting
some using this true contour and it's
working really well sculpting out like
the nude is just good to contour to how
it's a really nice take
this is a beautiful contour shade holy
shit
cannot forget the jawline that's fucking
important too
okay so I'm just gonna keep contouring
more and more until I'm happy with how
this looks this blends out so well and
it just looks so like the contour just
looks natural in a way like probably not
this cheek right here because this has a
little bit more filler in it than the
other one I think but you know bottom
lip and now I'm gonna slightly contour
my nose a little bit I'm just gonna take
the same brown shade and kind of run it
down the sides just a little bit I was
actually watching Jacqueline's video on
this palette the other day when it first
came out and she was explaining how
they're all pressed differently that's
why it's taking so long to make and it's
it's paid off what can I do for bronzer
and blush there's not really much I can
do
I guess what I could do is grab my
stipple brush and I'm gonna take the oh
I might take this plum II sort of shade
just here this one way what does this
look like what's good job make it work
then take a little bit of the plumy
shade
as I'm impressing myself it's gonna keep
packing on a little bit of this you have
got to be fucking me up the ass this is
beyond a joke this is the best fucking
challenge I've ever filmed
I am literally I'm speechless I could
cry I'm so happy about this like I love
it when a challenge that sounds really
hard like full face using I show that
sounds ridiculous works out like it just
makes you feel like you've conquered
something I don't know probably it's me
just being Claire I fuck wit but I'm
really really happy about this sitch now
what we're gonna do is highlight up
which is gonna be super super easy so
I'm just gonna take this brush here and
I'm gonna take one of the eyeshadows I'm
just not sure which one I think I'm
gonna take the yellowish shimmering wine
a little bit there so this looks like
I'm so fuckin soul
well
bitch list looks lip chipping my nards a
little bit to the bridge fuck off my
Cupid a little bit and then I'm gonna do
a little bit onto my brow barn because
I'm feeling extra today and a little bit
on the inner corners as well cause I'm
fucking sharp ok so now it's time for
the lips no fucking idea what I might do
oh my god I just had the best idea I'm
gonna get some fix+ and I'm gonna spray
it onto the back of my hand and then I
don't know if just gonna work it
probably home and then I'm gonna take
some of the rose gold shimmery shade I'm
gonna kind of scrape it off onto my
brush so there's a bit on there and kind
of create like a bit of a paste I guess
hmm no that's it was working but it's
kind of ugly so I'm gonna take that off
what am i doing instead I want to do a
nude lip so I'm gonna take some of the
this like brownie sort of shade I've
just scratched off heaps of it cuz I'm
gonna now mix this on the back of my
hand with some fix glass so I'm gonna
kind of turn it into a paste on the back
of my hand now I'm just gonna go in and
mmm didn't go over out much of it after
all that oh yeah here we go I'm going in
with less fixed plus I feel like that's
working better I've just fucked that
eyeshadow up okay now I'm just packing
over the top of that the eyeshadow
pattern so this is with nari
Haig's applause okay so now I'm going to
take a little bit at the dock of brown
just on the same brush and I want to
kind of like you know if this is gonna
work but I want to bring in like a
little bit of definition just feel like
a little bit okay and I'm just going to
define and then kind of is gonna drag it
on the outer edges to create like an
ombre effect and it's it's working and
I've had enough now it's gonna take a
little bit more than Uche and and we're
done
oh my god what the fuck sorry this is
the completed look I know there's a
little bit too much highlighter on my
face but it's there really I don't think
so I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video as much fun as I had filming it
this is the best challenge I've ever
done because it just sounds sorry like
it's not gonna work at the start like
it's just gonna be like
full-face without planning or something
like that's what its gonna look like by
the way I have done that so I find that
on my channel it's really funny um I
honestly thought this was going to be
the biggest shit show a mess of history
and to be honest I would write this a 9
out of 10 I probably just should have
put less highlighter on to make it war
more like wearable but honestly this
whole look is created with the jaclyn
hill morphe palette plus lashes and some
mascara but this is actually insane and
i cannot get over it
fuck anyway if you guys did enjoy this
video make sure you give it a massive
thumbs up subscribe if you are new here
make sure you follow me on Instagram
snapchat and Twitter and I love you guys
