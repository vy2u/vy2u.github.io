today I'm going to be doing a full face
of first impressions
hence the brows except the brows that's
where my brows are done because I do not
have any new eyebrow products so I am
just going to be doing everything else
on the face but brows so I've got some
pretty cool stuff in this box here I've
just got a box of stuff that I have not
tried yet I've condensed it down to put
into a video and some stuff I'm really
excited for like really excited for so
without any further ado let's get
straight into it we are going to be
starting off with eyes so I'm just going
to zoom you guys in a little bit so you
can see better there we go nice and
close okay so the first thing I'm going
to be trying is the Tarte marriage yuka
creaseless concealer now a lot of people
said this is really really sick they
really speak so a little concern this is
in the shade light
oh holy that is so thick
doesn't mean it's a bad concealer you
know you just gotta work with it okay so
I'm going to use this to carve out
underneath my brow okay so first
impressions it is so sick and so wet but
that's what some people might want in a
concealer maybe not me but just could
still work very well so I'm going to
bring it all down onto my lid area okay
once that's all covered it's got a
really good coverage oculars are
definitely know I don't have a
translucent powder that I have not used
yet so I'm just going to be using my
trusty RCM a got a new one look so
before I set that I'm just going to
blend it out with my Beauty Blender
almost blends nicely okay then I'm just
going to dip straight into a little bit
of our CMA and just set the lid okay so
I have these Inglot eye shadows here now
I have used English shadows before I
just have not used these I have not used
these cool tone colors cool Turin's I'm
not my forte as everybody knows but I'm
changing it up a little bit for the
call-sign loves out there so so this
palette right here so I'm going to do
something a little bit you know neutral
not to go on probably where you live
looks let's be real first of all I'm
just going to start off with this shade
and just here just on an EXO Beauty
tapered crease this is one of my
favorite crease brushes and I
just going to start by just blending
that into my crease the English shadows
have always blended literally like
butter
they're very powdery and you get a low
fall out like see that in the pan so I'm
just blending that throughout my crease
and can I just say guys cool tones are
not my favorite things to work with I
think there's start unflattering on my
eyes you know our company on warm turns
to rest of my life am I am I right am i
right
now I'm just gonna dip into this dark
chocolatey sort of brown color here I'm
just going to pop it on my out of the
area and kind of just bring it up for
the crease a touch so we go back to that
other brush again and kind of just blend
that through so I thought I really love
these Inglot eye shadows but I feel like
this so chalky is that bad
I know chalky or powdery just kind of
like I don't know I just compare
everything to the Buddha Beauty palette
because honestly it is my life so I'm
just going to take a smaller little
crease brush here just with that brown
color again just on my outer V and then
I'm actually going to dip into a little
bit of that black color or daring and
kind of just pop that on there too and
you know I've got to work on blending
this out
you know that's nice so just blending
out that's like with that darker Brown
that blacks really nice it's a really
nice black it's very pigmented as well
my final thoughts on these colored
English shadows is actually do like them
they're not chalky or powder it was just
me not putting enough product on and
then blending it out like I wasn't using
enough and I just thought it was very
sane and chalky and powdery but it's not
it's not okay anyway moving on to my
eyelid color this is the morphe pressed
pigment oh my god these are incredible I
really need to swatch them all on my
snapchat or something my snapchat is on
the screen right now because y'all are
like awesome my snapchat is this
is in the shade or color room service
that's when I use was powder room in
this one's room service I can name
cities now a lot of people have been
asking for a discount codes for morphe
and over and a few other things you a
and all that so I am working on all that
I've never really been a big fan of
using discount codes on my
pushing them on people because I don't
know I just don't but if you guys asked
for them then I will get them so I've
just got an hour for one at the moment
but um yeah I'm not going to talk about
them all the time I'll probably just
leave them on the screen for anyone who
is interested because you do get some
pretty good discounts anyway what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take this
pressed pigment and I'm just going to
spritz my brush with a little bit of
sixth class black always then I'm just
going to pop this green pigment all over
my lid I like that a lot that is oh so
nice it's going to blend around the edge
of that green just to kind of blend it
all in so there's no big wall in between
them that is literally everything I
wanted in this look cool these are
literally just like a foiled eyeshadow
but even better and more pigmented and
buildable very buildable now I'm just
going to do mascara today now anyway
instead of doing a half of my whole face
just cuz I just really just want to get
the eyes done this is the Tarte lifted
mascara now my friend said this was a
really really good so I'm keen to try
this out I love finding numerous scars
that I love only it just kind of does
the same job as any type of scar ah
but it's good do you know how many times
lately I've job myself in the
eye because of me trying to get too much
in there now I'm going to stick lashes
on now just because why not these are by
a brand called de moi lashes London and
just given a style no me n OE mie and or
EMI eight bindi but what they look like
done so I'm just going to stick these
lashes on using the House of lashes
black lash glue and just a little of the
lower lashes application tweezers okay
now that my lashes are arms going to
quickly get back into that black
eyeshadow and I'm kind of just going to
pop it on my inner corner just so I can
hide that lash band a little bit more
I might just actually go over it
slightly just with some black shadow
just so it's completely hidden just
because I am a little bit of a I'm
just going to apply some more mascara
onto those lashes just to make them more
like fuller and let people know that
they're really there now
just taking a little trusty makeup wipe
I'm just going to clean up underneath to
my eyes okay now for the fun part moving
on to the face for primer I'm going to
be using the jouer anti blemish matte
primer I'm excited to try this because I
love a matte a good match Primark Oh
smells a bit different but it feels good
on the skin you know okay can't really
give you first impressions of that
because I mean I don't know if private
even work on me to be honest I say in a
lot of my videos I never know if
climbers actually work I feel like
sometimes assistant marketing team
anyway don't see me now moving on to a
sound Diddley Dacian this is the Lancome
chant Idol ultra wear tent tent adult
ultra well or nikkietutorials but it's
in her favorites and I'll example need
to get it so I'm one out and bought it
pretty sure it's my shades
0:05 okay this is the 24-hour we're in
comfort retouch free anything with the
words 24 hours in an I will take and
snatch out of your hands
thanks okay so this is it here I'm just
going to pump a few pumps onto the back
of my hand and I'm going to take my
Baldy blender and we're just going to
start okay now have you looking like a
ghost so it's probably a little bit too
light for me but I'm hoping it will
oxidize ever so slightly guys it's got a
package from toothpaste so I'm hoping
there's something in here that I can put
in this video to I'm just going to
finish my foundation of all roads in
this okay so by the looks of it already
it's kind of oxidizing which is awesome
thought it was going to anyway because I
did swatch it on my hand and start on my
thoughts turned a little bit darker
that's awesome and it's such a beautiful
foundation like it's sitting so well on
my skin lately I've been loving high-end
foundations that a very full coverage
but don't have that taking this to them
like I love the remarkable by Marc
Jacobs but I feel like it's just so
heavy and like I used to be obsessed
with that I still love I think it's an
amazing foundation but like it's just so
kakie oh and by the way guys before each
video or any tutorial I put this lip
treatment on it is just the conditioning
lip treatment essential lip enhancer
beige away it just moisturizes your lips
and just make them look glossy and nice
so I just apply it with flash on videos
or you know whatever I really need to
get a facial and not that sort of facial
like a big odds true but I really need
to go on because my skin is just so bad
at the moment look how nicely foundation
fits you guys and it will oxidize a
little bit more I'm hoping to take this
head back a little bit and I'm just
gonna go straight in obsessor this
foundation by the way guys will see how
everything how it sets and how
everything packs onto it I also did by
the lemare foundation it was two hundred
 dollars was like a you serious
she's like would you like the powder I'm
like how much it's actually like 175
there in Australian prices bye bye guys
and I was like you're joking me like
that's ridiculous but makeup is like my
career makeup is everything to me so I'm
happy to spend the money on it
even though I think it's a joke
I literally look like Casper the ghost
but okay fine I don't see a problem with
looking like hassle to go holy
actually this is oxidizing a little bit
and I'm really happy about that
okay guys so I'm going to go back into
the Tarte creaseless concealer again I'm
going to see how this goes to highlight
my face and underneath my eyes so it is
very thick so I'm just going to need a
little bit so take my Beauty Blender
again and just blend that out too easy
look how easy this is to blend out no
hassles at all what-what-what-what warm
or now it is meant to be a creaseless
concealer so let's see how it goes
underneath the eyes regarding creasing
and all that now to taking my damp
Beauty Blender again I'm just going to
go to town on this it's doing is really
weird seeing under my eyes oh my god
it's taking all the foundation off under
my eye can you guys see that
okay well I'm definitely not going to
use this under my
that's what I'm just going to apply a
little bit of a tart shape tape to save
the day
well but are tight fixes tight shape
tape fixes everything to be honest
everything wham bam thank you ma'am
okay so as I mentioned at the start of
the video you guys know I don't how to a
new translucent powder to test out so
I'm just going to be using a little bit
of RT MA so I'm just going to dip my
Beauty Blender now a lot of people to
ask me where to buy the RCM a powder
from you can get it if you're in
Australia you can get up from crush
cosmetics which is a really good website
to get like wet and wild Milani all that
sort of stuff off it
I don't know Americans Amazon eBay Lac
it's everywhere just google it and you
will find it straight off the bat I
promise I'm just going to bake my nose
as well like I always do now I am just
going to go straight ahead and just set
the rest of my foundation okay just to
bronze my face a little bit today I'm
going to be trying the Bobbi Brown
golden light bronzing powder this is a
matte bronzing powder and it does look
very stunning I feel like this is going
to be an amazing color so I'm just going
to take that on this a big fluffy brush
here and I feel like I'm going to have
to go really light handed on this
because it is quite orange and I am
quite pale at the moment we're going to
take it really light handedly definitely
inspires a little bit more tan this
would be thick but I feel like this is
that little bit true orange I am just
slightly taking a little bit of dis
problems I just down the sides of my
nose just to kind of bring it in a
little bit this is the Marc Jacobs
tapered eyeshadow brush I guess I have
pages but I've never used it and it's a
really good cuz it's got that point on
it oh now in that toothpaste package I
actually just opened it and oh I'm sorry
lucky right now so from Too Faced I just
got the three and you love light
highlighters so I can test one of these
out in today's video which I'm so
excited about because the other
highlighter I had was not that exciting
um then we got the Too Faced and natural
love eyeshadow palette oh my gosh I feel
like these colors in here are very like
shimmery and pretty but you can create a
lot of different looks cool hot and
bothered looks like a nice color I'm
sorry
makes me so happy when a brand comes out
with an eyeshadow palette with a black
in it if there's no black in it how you
meant to like make it full glam like
this is going to be so like simple and
neutral you need a black in every
eyeshadow palette if I have to ever make
one every just Orange copper Burgundy's
gold black and oh my god I'm so pissed
off that I got this after today's video
but I could use these in today's on
these are the Too Faced chocolate brow
pencils so I'll be testing them out in a
video as well and then we have the new
shades of the Too Faced melted at matte
liquid lipsticks and I can honestly tell
the contactee are they're going to be my
favorite already it's cool holy chic
stunning now I do want to contour my
face a little bit more from so excited
to test this out this is the flower
light version so basically benefits
always had this version of hoola and
it's been quite dark but never come out
with a lighter version which is amazing
not gonna lie I have already used this
but I'm going to be telling you my first
impressions about it on camera as well
so I'm just going to take it on this
little brush here and I'm just going to
go straight in it's just the most
perfect contouring color ever I should
have contoured the flat bottoms I always
switch that up so someone with a skin
tone like mine when I'm not tan like I
just can't even deal just running it
down the sides of the nose so before we
go any further I just want to get under
my eyes finish so I'm going to exactly
what I did on the top underneath so just
start a really light brown color and
just popping that all the way under my
lash line then I'm going to go in with
that darker brown color again and just
pop that a little bit closer to my lash
line then I was going to take this a
blending brush and just blend it out
that is taking a tint a little bit of
the black on this brush here just on the
outer corner just so it's not too
intense I mean you can make it in terms
as you want but today I'm not going to
be making it too intense I'm just going
to brush off that excess under I baked
because that is no longer needed here
now for blush today guys this is the
Bobbi Brown Clementine blush and I'm
just going to put
little tiny bit on my cheeks sister give
me a little bit of color up so
pigmented I don't think this is the
right color for me either so I'm just
going to blend over start blush on this
site because I feel like I look like a
bit of a clown now we're going back to
that Tarte lifted mascara I'm just going
to pop this on my bottom lashes now
moving on to highlighter as I said
earlier we're going to be using this Too
Faced a love life blinded by the light
this one is called and I literally just
got using the pose by not even ten
minutes ago so before I do that I'm just
going to spritz my face with some
six-plus love to smell it out on a
Monday morning I'm just gonna take my
favorite highlighting brush at the
moment this is the morphe r-36
and I'm just going to generously dip
into that one thing I do look for in a
highlighter is the right color for me
obviously but that's much worse to
choose that and the blend ability of it
and then on chunkiness I hate hate
chunky highlighters so much if it blends
really well and it doesn't bring our
texture too much which is exactly what
this is doing it's a fait and you can
always add some more fix plus on your
brush and then dip straight back into
your highlighter because then you're
going to get more intensity ABS that is
absolute stunning mmm I feel like this
is the perfect color for my skin tone as
well it's like not true after midterms
anything like that which is stunning
can't forget that nose bridge and now
last but not least for my liquid
lipstick today I'm going to be trying a
D a multi a virgin a liquid lipstick
that I had been wanted to try these
inner videos it's so long ever
since they came out they've just been
sitting in the get to try box down the
bottom line and completely forgot about
them until today so yeah not bad formula
hey guys so I'm actually able to tell
you I wore this around my house for like
five hours when I first got these and
I'm sorry impressive the formula I
didn't wear this color but I'm sure the
formulas going to be very similar like
each color so I think any other
cockadooters would look like living and
 Australia and I don't actually
have a new setting spray to try so
I'm just going to spritz my face with a
little bit of six-plus anyway guys this
is the completed look of my full face of
first impressions I really hope you guys
did enjoy this video I will leave all
the products that I used today down
below in the description and if you guys
have any video requests that you guys
want to see me do please feel free to
leave them down below also because I'll
be happy to add them to my list of
yester doing videos I love you guys so
much and I'll see you all in my next
