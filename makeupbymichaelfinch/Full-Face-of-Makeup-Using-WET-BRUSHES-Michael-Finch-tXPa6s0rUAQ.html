channel so right now I'm sitting down
and it's currently 2018 so this is the
first official video that I will be
filming for this year and I'm so excited
I'm so excited for this year it's going
to be sorry intense insane crazy and
busy but that's what I love doing I love
keeping busy keeps me on my toes
oh sorry before I get started on today's
video I would just like to thank
everybody for 700,000 subscribers that
is crazy I don't want to get cheesy but
I really appreciate it
so much and the next mark that I want
you hit by the end of this year is 1
million whoo that's insane all right
without any further ado let's get
straight into the video
okay so today I'm gonna be doing a full
face using wet makeup brushes
now when I say wet makeup brushes are
not gonna be like dripping in water
because that would just be unrealistic
in a shitshow waiting to happen I am
gonna dip them in water and then just
like wring it out once not like fully
wring it out but just like wring it out
I haven't seen anyone else do this
challenge at all I literally thought of
it myself so yeah this is probably one
of the most dumbest challenges I've ever
done but I haven't like a slight feeling
that it's actually gonna work the full
face using the egg was probably the
dumbest one I've ever done but I have a
feeling this is actually gonna work to
somewhat extent so let's go okay so the
first product I'm gonna be taking is the
benefit foolproof a brow powder and I'm
gonna be taking my angled brush and I've
actually got a glass of water right here
ready to just go okay this brush is nice
and wet and now I'm gonna i'm actually
gonna ruin quite a few of my makeup
products from doing this but honestly i
can just scrape it off and it will all
be as good as new so there's gonna dip
into the end of the pad area and then
I'm just gonna go you have pigmentation
okay perfect
for the brow products having a wet brush
isn't all that bad to be honest the eye
shadow is what I'm worried about but
we're gonna make a work
oh god this looks better then it
normally does without water and I'm just
gonna dip it in a little bit more just
to keep the whole challenge flowing and
keep it nice and wet okay so this is one
brow down that with a wet brush it's
actually worked pretty good sorry I'm
gonna dip into my next brush and it's
just this flat shader brush then just to
get my water bang off the excess should
thick you don't need just like with the
nice shadows this and if the concealer
I'm just gonna be using my taut shake K
as per usual honestly sorry father
there's not much difference at all well
that was easy
oh my god how am I gonna set my eyes
with powder this can all turn really
quick I mean I've got my hurts right at
this point in time but you know give it
just wait until I bleep at the powders
and then everything's gonna turn into a
bit of a show okay now I'm gonna
take that brush that I've been using for
my concealer lightly from
one day soaking it and then I'm gonna
pop a little bit more concealer over my
lids and then we're gonna try to blend
it out okay you know how I came out with
this idea I was literally cleaning some
of my makeup brushes the other day of my
I wonder what makeup would apply like
with wet brushes like ditching water
brushes and I was like oh my god
full face challenge you know that's how
some video ideas come around just from
cleaning your makeup brushes and
my apologies if anyone else has done
this before but I literally went through
like 30 pages of YouTube and I saw
nothing okay now to set that in place
I'm gonna takes note the dermablend pad
I'm just gonna tip it out into the lid
and then I'm gonna take this fluffy
brush here and oh god this is where
everything is literally going going to
 itself hard okay take a little bit
of that on my brush and just lightly dab
okay well I think it's setting at I
can't tell if it's setting it or not all
right well it looks like it's set okay
it looks like it's set so today I'm
gonna be using this palette from zoeva
this is the cafe palette
there's some absolutely stunning colors
in here so the first one I'm gonna go in
with is probably this burgundy that's
not back Andy I don't know what it is
but let's just call it Burgundy
and I'm gonna be taking oh gosh this
brush from makeup addiction and I mean
literally is going to be she's wet she's
ready to go and I'm just gonna straight
into my shadow oh oh my god it's this is
going to be it looks like it's acrylic
paint oh my god my eyelids feel like wet
do i or do I not have instant regret
about this challenge already you know
what it we're gonna make this way
cuz I've had enough all right I'm just
gonna attempt to blend this shut it out
oh my god why is it doing that maybe
because you're I should have bushes wet
my cool new things
oh my god it's literally like paint
alright I'm gonna take this brush here
dip it into my water and I'm gonna see
if I can fix up the shadow by just
patting okay that's not too bad but I'm
just want to go back in with the wet
brush that I used just before and some
more of that color what am i doing
and I'm gonna build up a little bit more
and drag it through my crease okay let's
move on to the next shade sorry at this
time I'm gonna take this crease brush
from zoeva and then I'm gonna go into
the shade right here
oh that looks nasty yeah oh my gosh okay
that's gone so incredibly patchy I'm
only thought that I'm gonna go back to
that flat brush I'm just gonna dampen it
a little bit more and then I'm just
gonna try and blend out the edges cuz I
feel like
this brush is like doing the marks when
it comes to the whole blending process I
take someone this flat brush by itself
yeah
then I'm gonna go back to that brush
that I used before and just really
lightly blend
a little bit more Nelson take this
little smaller blender brush dip this
 in top off the and now we're
gonna go straight into this dark brown
color here a little bit of definition in
his data corner wow that is a chart
waiting to happen now oh my goodness oh
my goodness why did I go in with the doc
ah you know what this is fine
I'm gonna take my flat brush again and
try and keep that pigment that you know
I'm just gonna do the same on the side
and to be honest guys so far this isn't
looking that bad like once you've packed
on enough eyes shadow and enough product
and you've blended it out the best of
your ability I'm not that mad about it
so now taking the flat shader brush
again I'm just gonna read wet this and
I'm just going to the shimmery shade
here now this shouldn't really be a
problem with this shimmery shade because
it is after all too shimmery shade so
oops oops oops that shouldn't matter too
much okay cool
and then when we get to the edge I'm
just gonna slightly cap its gonna do the
exact same on this side
now mascara obviously it's common sense
I'm not gonna dip my mascara wand into
water so I'm just going to apply that as
per usual and then I'm just gonna pop
some lashes on and then I'm gonna get
started on the face now I'm excited to
see how that goes so hold up okay sorry
eyelashes are now or not let's get
started on my face sorry primer
what the am I using look this is
just beyond me that I didn't pick a
primer and I've had enough so the primer
that I'm using is the charlotte tilbury
wonder glory that's what I'm gonna use
uh oh my god this is so Instagram cover
photo now I need to get a brush spread
out can't use my fingers just take this
brush from Real Techniques in a minute
I'm gonna do like this okay
and now I'm just going to blend all this
in this oh my god water is just dripping
out there shouldn't be too much of a
problem because primer is just like you
know whatever okay so now moving on to
foundation I'm gonna be taking mixture
of the luminous silk and some of the nas
long-wave foundation and I'm gonna mix
these together a little bit come on you
 I swear I just bought you a
few weeks ago caulk well I'm gonna be
using this much of the George Armani and
mixing in a little bit of you can eBay
okay it makes days too little
together and now I'm gonna be going in
with a brush to do my foundation today
because using a damp Beauty Blender is
just like common sense I don't want to
check here okay I don't want to change
g36 right here okay so here's my brush
I'm gonna dip this in a water I'm
showing you guys cuz I feel like people
are just gonna call me a saint you
didn't even wet that look I'll just be
cheating myself if I was cheating anyone
and I don't appreciate that and I don't
like it either okay
morphe g36 movie g36 blue right and I'm
just gonna start blending this but smart
pad at all yet
hold that saw plays so it's blending out
quite well only problem is it looks like
there's like little holes everywhere I
like little you know what I'm just gonna
keep blending and pray then I can make
this look somewhat presentable so this
doesn't look too bad it's just fantastic
all right so quickly just went and
concealed the tops of my brows with the
flat shader brush and yes it was wet and
I'm just going to start doing my
forehead
you just gotta tap so I like tap hard at
first and then tap lightly afterwards
and it gets rid of all like those little
weird looking thing Jesus Christ dude a
knee Bop Conda looks like a baby good in
my belly
baby back lips now to do a little bit of
cream contouring and bronzing because
I'm smart I know it would turn into a
 shart sorry I'm gonna take the
shade deep of the tot shaped a beauty
and put it where at don't make onto are
but I'm gonna be applying heaps today I
try not to get it in your blonde hair
like I always do and then I'm gonna be
taking my favorite contouring cream
contouring brushes is the Kat Von D
number two and fantastic can't wait and
I'm just going to take that brush and
start contouring and blending this out
it's kind of moving like the foundation
underneath the conceal a bit so they
take some from that side and put it back
on this side now good drawing what I'm
really scared about is setting all this
on my face cuz I know once the powders
hit this face I'm absolutely
just went off camera not off camera I
just went and did my nose contouring
because I'm sweating up and storming
here because it's literally about sixty
thousand degrees in Brisbane at the
moment combined with all these lights in
the humid weather it's just not going
down well with me is that so just went
in did that off-camera blasted a fan for
a few seconds so I didn't die of sweat
stroke just look alright I can't like
work out if it looks good or bad just
blending out pretty well though I'm not
gonna lie
okay I kind of look orange / gallo but
what do I do with that I'm then gonna be
taking my tart double squat shape tape
you there
this isn't a shade fair neutral what
brush can I use for this to be honest I
think I've just myself hardcore
I'm gonna be using this makeup forever
professional brush haven't actually
tried this out before but I'm just gonna
tip this Dinu it and then I'm just going
to mm-hmm okay I kind of just took a
majority to cancel off but well I think
that I'm gonna try and blend out this
NARS okay that's not all that bad just
gonna bring it back in slightly actually
but I'm making a whack and then I'm just
going to blend out my forehead should
brighten up this area a little bit more
cuz I just bought the dark colors too
down too far why does my forehead look
so patchy who knows okay under eyes
let's do this
oh my god I've never blended out my
under eyes with a brush before
to be honest I was expecting a lot a lot
worse um so this brush is kind of dried
off in the process of doing that
someone's gonna rent the
and then I'm just gonna dip straight
into my dermablend setting powder
okay wow that's baking ever so slightly
and then it's going to take this little
baby brush here then I'm going to take
some of these people in here from
colour-pop this is in the shade shiny
shiny shiny shiny shiny yeah and then
I'm gonna pop this straight under my
lash line fantastic you know what guys
I'm not mad at this I'm not mad at all
okay fam so I've just popped on some
bottom mascara with the mascara
applicator obviously I'm not dipping
that into water as I said before um but
now it's time for a bit of blush now
this is powder so pray for me okay sorry
I'm just going to take my stipple
theá-- nipple brush just gonna get off
the excess perfect don't take this
blush yet from japanesse oh this is not
gonna be cute oh my god just going
lightly
I'm just chopping up really really
lightly cuz I don't wanna move too much
under da nice little flash of color okay
this isn't as bad as I thought it was
after adding a nice little bit of color
my foreheads patchy Oh No that was a bad
idea by the way I haven't even set my
face cuz I'm too scared because I want
this to look semi decent okay so now I'm
gonna be taking my art for highlighter
this is in the shade where I dare drive
and I'm gonna be taking this little
brush right here and wetting it so it is
literally dripping wet thank you
and I'm gonna dip into my highlighter
now this shouldn't be a problem but it
could be and I'm just gonna pop this oh
my gosh
I like this that just applied by
highlighter literally sorry nicely I was
expecting to go so crumbly and patchy
okay alright I'll I wow that looks sorry
nice I'm impressed
I honestly thought this was gonna turn
out to be like the biggest start of
a challenge
full face challenge but actually I'm not
even bad at all
just gonna dip this back in because it's
kind of got a bit dry oh my god I'm
applying with my highlighter with water
for the rest of my life I'm not even
kidding like a wet brush but
like it's so weird because I do it with
fixed possums just guys patchy so I'm
thinkin amazing we'll just do some
contouring bronzing cuz I've done
everything else I may as well try out
this and see how it goes so I'm gonna
take my morphe r7 brush this is very
fluffy so I'm assuming this is where
everything is gonna go absolutely
shit-faced Doug off me alright then
I'm just gonna dip into this a bronzer
this is from Too Faced it's the Sun
bunny natural bronzer and I'm going in
with delight as possible here
oh my gosh that's not so bad
initially just going with the lightest
hand possible I'm not mad I'm not mad
more or less just like dabbing dis on
I'm getting a decent amount out to like
 me it's kind of working when you
just literally like tap it as light as a
feather so I look at it at the end of
the festival my forehead is looks like
Hachi gonna run a little bit down the
sides of my nose oh my god why can I
keep smelling bindi my God if she pissed
on my brushes I swear to God knowing her
she probably got up on the makeup table
and tried to piece all over my brushes
just because she thinks that she can get
away with everything okay so everything
is pretty much done you guys I'm so
 impressed with this whole entire
look I didn't set my foundation because
I'm simply too scared but it's tight
shape tape it'll just set itself pretty
much okay you guys so this brings us to
the end of today's video this is
actually such a fun challenge to do like
a full face challenge like I actually
really enjoyed doing it because it
worked out it worked out and I'm
actually pretty impressed with how
everything looks it might be a little
bit patchy yeah a little bit intense
there but like we can deal with it
because I'm happy with the entire look I
