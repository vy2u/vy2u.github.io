hey guys welcome back to my channel so I
don't have much time for an intro like I
always do this to myself and my
voiceovers sorry about it I'm just using
the mac pro longwear concealer as a base
for my eyeshadow and then I'm gonna be
blending that out with my Beauty Blender
until it's flawless then to set that
before it gets a chance to crease I'm
just taking NAS beach press powder you
can just use any press powder just to
set that so it doesn't crease and then
your eyeshadows not going to be all
 up now for eyeshadow today I'm
using the Anastasio Modern Renaissance
palette guys this palette my fave you
know this by now I'm just taking those
two shades they're letting them together
and kind of like putting them into my
crease now I must say this look is a
hundred percent inspired by a girl
called makeup by jar I will leave her
link down below for her channel she is
incredible she is amazing she gives me
so much inspiration on the daily and she
completely inspired me to do this look
like this is one of her looks that I've
recreated haven't really changed it much
it's almost the same so kudos to jar for
the inspo so now I'm just blending that
through mcruiz you know blending that
through Mele crews now I'm taking that
orange color and popping that onto my
lid just kind of going to be using this
before I go in with the next color it's
gonna be a surprise be ready for it
when's it happening obviously not yet
we're still blending I'm so bad at these
voiceovers guys you have no idea I
actually a you do because I'm doing one
right now and you guys are listening um
this is the surprise shade red ochre
smack damn on that lid I love it these
colors are literally my favorite combos
and I know I do a lot of these like
tutorials that are like very similar but
I just can't stop doing them because
they're my favorite warm Browns golds
like just all those sort of colors I
just spice up your life um then I'm just
taking that shade that I just pointed
out on the palette and popping that
under my brow bone to make that pop a
little bit more kind of brings that he
Bravo and you know it kind of brings it
out now my mascara I'm using the Loreal
carbon black mascara I got this off
I don't know I think eBay I don't know
you can't buy it in Australia but you
can get in America it's American like
exclusive I don't know
these lashes are from lamomam mink
lashes i leave them down below and the
lash glue that i use was hassle of
lashes my favorite ever well for prime
I'm just using the Australis the
original cram boola
I'm just shoving that on my face rubbing
it in and hoping for the best
foundation is the Make Up For Ever Ultra
HD you guys know this is my new favorite
foundation I've got a lot of new
favorite foundations on their way by the
way I'm like not new favorite
foundations on their way but I've got a
lot of new foundations coming that I
know I'm going to be obsessed with so
stay tuned Allen stay back and tuned
sunders to find out all over my face
into you look like a oppa Loompa
and then I'm just blending it out with
my damp Beauty Blender and trying to
cover everything up and blending it out
seamlessly which I think I did a pretty
good job of now I'm just taking my prac
Mac practic
the taking my Mac Pro Longwear concealer
in shade and 350 to conceal my under eye
bags and I don't know what's going on
with my voice today I'm work talking and
all these different accents don't know
and I'm just putting it on my forehead
my nose bridge Cupid's bow and my chin
and then blending that out with my damp
Beauty Blender once again
just continuing to blend that out until
it's all nice and seamlessly blended you
know you know and then under those eyes
I always like to blend under my eyes
last purely because they crease the most
so then once I plan it under my eyes and
I go straight in with my Beauty Blender
on to the powder and set my under eyes
so no starts creasing you know what
I'm saying baking my nose and my chin
whatever I brush it off in a second
anyway don't leave it on there for as
long as my under eyes I'm just using my
Australis fresh and flawless in the
shade medium tan to set the rest of my
foundation gives me a little bit more
coverage rather than just using that
translucent powder look how fast
I'm going oh my god I'm Superman now
basically what I'm doing on my under
eyes is exactly the same what I did on
top of my eyes same um what's a call you
know when you do it in steps you're
doing it in the same steps that's just
what I said
and I'm just blending that all together
with a few different brushes that I'll
leave on the screen obviously cuz I'm
leaving all the brushes on the screen
now guys you know that and I'm just
blending that down having it nice and
smoky
I was thinking about doing black in my
waterline but then I was like me better
not anyway I'm just brushing away my
under eye baked to get rid of all that
white powder honey get rid of that white
powder brushing it off yeah we've got a
lot of brushing off oh then I'm just
doing my bottom lashes with that same
mascara that I used before which is the
L'Oreal for bronzer I'm using the art
FRA bronzer in the shade Americana just
on a big fluffy brush I really like
using massive fluffy brushes for bronzer
like I don't know I just feel like it
gives such a floor with smoke I don't
know it just looks so much more I brush
in my opinion I don't know but I'm just
doing my job I cheat my phone head and I
think I did a little bit down the side
of my nose I don't know probably not I
don't
Naji guys understand why I love doing
voiceover so much because I can jam the
 out to music and I love it oh my
god it's so good then again I do love
chatting to you guys but that's the only
one I'm in the mood and IG husbands talk
about anyway I'm just using the Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer to
contour my cheekbones my jaw my forehead
everything like that and I do contour my
nose a little bit but I do have a fully
dedicated video if you guys have not
seen that just go back a few videos ago
you'll find it it's there you'll see it
I snatch the out of my nose the
absolute now instead of using the
oh free banana powder today I'm
switching it up and I'm using the
Australis banana powder this isn't the
best banana powder I've used it's not
all that pigmented but it does the job
okay it does the job okay it does the
job I just about a million times I don't
really know what I'm talking about today
guys I'm just like chilling out filming
this voiced-over
and enjoying my life I'm just putting a
little bit out on my forehead as well
just brighten up that area but I'm just
quickly going back to the UH Nastasia
palette and putting a little bit of that
brow bone highlight on the inner corners
of my eyes to brighten it up for my
highlighter today I'm just using the
kathleenlights makeup geek highlighter
palette before that though I'm just
spraying my face with a little bit of
fixed place just so my face is a little
bit wet so my highlighted sticks a bit
better I feel like this just works
better than spraying the brush or the
product and it doesn't go chunky I don't
know just what works for me darlin just
putting a little bit of that highlight
on my Cupid's bow in the bridge of my
nose now I'm just taking a damp Beauty
Blender and pressing everything into my
skin so this basically just blends
everything together presses it into your
skin and gives them all don't want to
say natural but I feel like it gives you
more of a natural sort of look like it
just blends and presses everything it
just looks a lot more airbrushed in my
opinion now to set my face I'm just
using the japonesque makeup setting
spray this isn't like an aerosol sort of
can it was kind of weird rather than
like pressing a button and it's spraying
out I don't know it's just I don't know
um so my lips today I'm just using Kylie
cosmetics Dolce K I believe this one was
and I'm just learning my lips with that
normally I don't use lip liner I just
with a liquid lipstick but today I'm not
using a liquid lipstick Oh surprise
surprise I'm using the male cosmetics
matte lipstick in the shade posh posh
posh posh and I'm just applying that and
then I'm just going to be going back in
with a little bit of lip liner just to
blend everything together you know and
then my lip gloss is color pop not sure
what this is called I'll leave it down
below and yeah that's pretty much it
guys
I hope you guys enjoyed in this video if
you did and you learned something new
today don't forget to give me a thumbs
up I love you guys so much and I will
see you all in my next video bye e I
can't really say eh or see ya because
