be doing a full glam look on like a
Christmas look I want this video just to
be just me putting on makeup talking a
bit of trying out some new products
as per usual I've got this FNT Beauty
liquid lipstick that I really want to
use for this so I'm gonna make this the
main feature of the whole book I've also
got a new foundation from NARS but I
want to try out and I've also got an
eyeshadow palette from BH Cosmetics that
I also want to try out because I've
heard really good reviews about this
baby so starting off I'm just gonna be
taking the full proof a brow powder from
a benefit this is in the shade number 3
and because I got my brows tinted
yesterday and waxed I don't really need
to fill them in with a pencil I'm just
gonna do a bit of powder I'm sorry I'm
just going to take the lightest shade on
this side at first so just taking a
lighter shade I'm just gonna pop this
through the front of the brow and I'm
gonna focus the darkest shade unlike the
end of the brow just to get that like
ombre effect sort of thing and the brush
that I'm using is just the angled
benefit brow brush which is passed it's
very dense and it really packs on the
patter exactly what you want it to car
and then I'm going to take the darkest
shade at the end of the compact and just
put that right on the end of my
oh yes come on brows I loved when I
first got my brows waxed and tinted
because they're like perfect I didn't
have where I was going with that so I
actually need to extend the end of my
brow oh my god this is so messy so I'm
just going to take the benefit browsing
in the shade number three and I'm just
going to take the wax part of it cuz I'm
just gonna use this just to add a little
bit of length onto the towel of my bra
and then just to set that in place them
doesn't take the darkest shade from the
brow powder kit and just set everything
everything and then it's gonna take a
little bit of benefit to give me Brown
in the shade number three every brow
product that I use and benefit is in the
number three just letting you guys know
and I'm just gonna brush the hairs
upwards and this is just gonna tent like
little Blondie's I've got in there and
make at the brows stick and stay in
place
oh dang so now the so now the birth of
my brows are done I was gonna be taking
the NARS radiant creamy concealer in the
shade creme Brule creme brulee every
single time I hear the word creme brulee
I'm just like oh my god
High School Musical when they were
singing that song creme brulee keep your
voice down though not another word and
then shopay comes in she's like
everybody shut the up because I I
have had enough alright so I'm gonna
take that on a flat shader brush this is
the zoeva 233 creme shader and I'm just
gonna go to town and conceal these brows
on Lily stop hitting things I'm just
gonna drag this concealer to my laid
dickhead here forgot to wear these
Beauty Blender as per usual so he's
actually gonna get off these fantastic
he'll be back no I'm just gonna blend
all this before that gets a chance to
crease I'm just gonna set it with some
of the astrologer outer in the shade
nude top slightly so just dipping into
the BH Cosmetics palette I'm just gonna
take this peachy sort of color just uses
my trans issue is something my
and I'm just gonna pop this into my
crease and this is going to be the
transition that goes between the brow
and the lid color I'm just gonna bring
it this shade all the way into my inner
corner and kind of just like buffing out
on the edge and then I'm just gonna take
like this docker sort of transition just
from bladedge with jakka this is the
Cenex sorry XO Beauty I should i blend
off is like my everything and I'm gonna
blend this through my crease area I'm in
just taking a clean blending brush and
just blending those two should get off
and more so just blending out the edges
okay
cool beans brush kill bananas the next
shade I'm gonna dip into is like this
coal turned light brown I'm just gonna
pop this into like that got a part of my
eye I'm tapping off the brush as I add
more by the way alright so I'm quite
happy with how that's looking and then
just gonna take a more dense brush this
is the XO Beauty small blender and I'm
just going to take the darker Brown I'm
just gonna pop this holy these
eyeshadows sorry pigmented and I'm also
gonna bring this right in to the inner
corner just a little bit lower than the
shadows before and then I'm just gonna
lightly buff those shades it's not going
to have either so I don't lose the
transition now to add some black I'm
just gonna be taking this palette from
NARS this is the man Roy palette and I'm
just gonna be taking the black shade out
of it because the BH one doesn't have a
black in it unfortunately if it did it'd
be perfect but it doesn't and I'm just
going to take a little bit of this
shadow
and Oh poplars right in to the out of
the super pigmented this black which is
fab take a bit more of that darker brown
and just blend over the edge of the
block
okay sorry the other eyes now have done
but I'm just gonna take a little bit of
that black shadow from the nos palette
and I'm gonna put it on my inner corner
and i kind of blend that into the middle
this is super full glam by the way like
 me now I'm gonna go in with the top
shape tight this is in the shade fair
beige and I'm just gonna take a little
bit of that on the back of my hand okay
now I'm gonna take a little bit of the
concealer and start on my lid it's gonna
change to a small brush Somers but uh
and then I'm just gonna take this other
little brush and just kind of DAB the
edges of the concealer anymore so I like
a blend it in your shadow
and then it's gonna go back into the NAS
palette and I'm gonna take the gold
shade and I'm gonna pack this onto like
the middle
and I'm just gonna kind of pack the
shadow into the outer edges and it will
just kind of blend itself together and
then just gonna take a little bit more
of the black from the nos palette and
kind of just like tap it over the edges
just to blend everything in completely
and I kind of bring the black up and
like fade it into the middle so this is
pretty much the eye look I'm really
impressed that I haven't really done
like a middle cut crease like this
before I know it's taking forever but
I'm getting there now it's time for a
wing I'm just really taking the NYC
liquid eyeliner and I'm just gonna do a
big fuck-off link now for a little bit
of mascara I'm just gonna take the ciate
London Wonderland mascara okay I just
popped a little bit of a scar on and now
I'm gonna be taking the the lower lashes
these are in this style you complete me
just a few things about the lower lashes
these can be used up to 25 times so you
can like clean them and reuse them like
up to 25 times you probably use them all
these are handmade and the whole effect
that they have on your eyes just gives
like a nice soft natural look and these
are one of the easiest lash brands to
apply just because the lash band is so
thin on them and it's that and also and
you have a discount code and I will
leave it on the screen right now and
down below thank you you still haven't
done this I I'm gonna do it after I've
got this one done because it's pissing
me off I'm just gonna blow on it for a
little bit and then I'm just gonna add a
little bit of extra mascara just really
popping you don't have to hide my scar
but I always like to add of mascara
oh my fake lashes all right I'm just
gonna do this side and then I'll come
back and we'll get started on the face
oh my god it feels like it's taking
flight ever okay so now that my eyes are
pretty much John will the top pot sigh
let's get started on me face so for my
primer I'm just gonna be using V at
Becca backlight my mom just to give a
nice Christmas glory that was sore Lang
used to give a nice color to my skin
honestly
so incredibly good so far foundation
I've got this new one here from NARS it
is called the natural radiant long wear
foundation shake what before you so I've
got two different shades I've got Yukon
and oz load so I think one's a little
bit true lion ones a little bit like too
dark so I'm just gonna mix the two
together and see what happens
comes with a pump on top which is fab
love getting a foundation that already
comes with a pump it's always the best
I'm just gonna dot that all over and
then I'm just gonna grab my Beauty
Blender and dip it into a little bit of
the foundation and then start blending
it out wow this is a really good
coverage natural
I don't think so hon okay so I'm just
blending this in and it's blending up so
well I'm just gonna slightly take this
down my neck a little bit but we can
bronze that off afterwards just so it
all comes together nicely this is sorry
beautiful oh my gosh
first I'm using this and I really like
it this is the first nice foundation
I've ever tried I've never even tried D
sheer glow from NARS so good apparently
that one's really light coverage but
this is just like a whole new level of
coverage I'm just gonna take a little
bit of this fantasia and just conceal
the tops of my brows I'm just gonna do
my forehead
yes I love these browser like allergy
Instagram brows as people like to call
them and from what I can tell so far
this foundation hasn't oxidized oh so
impressed with this foundation I said it
once and I'll say it again I love it
now I'm just gonna take the top shape
tape again I'm gonna highlight my t-zone
and also my under eyes and look live
like I'm just going to add a little bit
of the NARS concealer just to kinda make
it a little bit less white testing one
 yeah I'm just gonna start by
blending out my forehead the concealer
is blending really well over the
foundation - it's not like taking it off
or anything like that okay so now just
to set my under eyes woman's gonna be
taking the Maybelline fit me powder the
shades that Claire to bank the situation
press it into the sides of my nose I
cannot tell you how many times someone's
called my buzzer today to drop off a
parcel black literally this video has
taken so long stepped on the Australia
Post is with me
so now to set the rest of the foundation
and placements gonna take the Rimmel
stay matte powder I'm just gonna dump
that in we're just gonna give a little
bit of Lac color back as well as well as
sitting the foundation now to get these
under eyes finished off I'm just going
to take a little bit of the orange shade
from the BH Cosmetics palette gonna have
some waffle good a lot and then it's
gonna take a little bit of that darker
Brown and just pop it right up against
my lash line - then I'm gonna go
straight in on my waterline with the
essence extreme lasting eye pencil then
it's gonna take some more of that darker
Brown and just this little smudger brush
and just blend it down next I'm just
gonna be taking the benefit hoola light
and starting to contour and carve out my
cheekbones and my whole entire face the
brush I'm using is from BH Cosmetics
it's my ray-ray number two so this is
from it's my ray ray collaboration
I'm loving these brushes lately wolf
they're just contouring the jawline and
under my chin and also my forehead now
because I just went a little bit more of
extra contrary I'm just gonna take the
regular hole off and I'm just gonna go
in and deepen up the contour then for
blush I'm just gonna be adding a little
bit of this pink blush here from Make Up
For Ever this is from me Jessie J
collection I think I'm not sure they're
just all in a compact so I'm gonna give
this a well it's gonna be adding a tiny
little bit of this it looks super hot
pink in the pan but when it goes on it
looks different I like it I like it more
than what it looks in the pan now I'm
also just gonna wipe off my under-eye
because it's been there for so long and
my bottom lashes I'm just gonna take a
little bit of the Mac extended play
gigablack lash now also for my
highlighter I'm just gonna take this
highlight it out of the make are further
palette and I'm just gonna pop this oh
wow oh my cheeks I haven't actually ever
tried do you make offers or highlighters
before sorry this is this is a moment to
remember stunning and I'm also just
gonna pop a little bit under my brow
barn
and also it's gonna hit my inner corners
as well and also on my inner corners I'm
just going to take the heavy metal liner
from urban decay in the shade Midnight
Cowboy and I'm just gonna kind of dot
that on my inner corners just to give a
nice bit of cool so last but not least
now I'm just gonna be applying the Fenty
liquid lipstick in the shade on sensor
this is what the whole look is about so
I better job right because the douthitt
applicator looks it cooked so I'm
obviously not gonna talk and I just say
and now to finish off the whole look I'm
just gonna be taking you to face
hangover three-in-one replenishing
primer and setting spray oh it's both I
don't know how that works but okay guys

everything is done I know this video

wanted to change it up and do something
a little bit different on the eyes and
