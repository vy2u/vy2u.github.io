today I'm gonna be filming a get ready
with me this is like a dark dark dark
smoky eye with a pop of color and some
cute little lips so if you guys want to
see how I did this stay tuned and keep
watching if you enjoyed it don't forget
to give it a thumbs up and subscribe to
my channel if you haven't already okay
so let's just get straight into it I'm
just going to go straight in with my
eyebrows because I don't want to do the
market carnation so just because I
really don't want to I'm just going to
be taking a none estar to do brow pomade
in the shade chocolate and some eyelash
got this let's that off and let's
get straight into it now the brush I'm
using is just from thermo Beauty it's
just the 206 brush it's a little angle
brush any angle brush will work
basically what I'm doing is just tracing
my actual ram just gonna speed this part
up just cuz it does take me a while so I
just kind of draw a line on the bottom
and then I start on the top then I'm
just going to change to my Anastasia
brow Pro palette I'm just gonna grab a
powder just to kind of ombre the front
of it and I'm going to be using probably
medium brown this gray little one here
same brush who cares you can wash it
after and I'm just kind of blending that
into the front of the eyebrow I saw a
comment on my video the other day that
was like um what's with these eyebrows
like why does everyone like them so much
they look like bull horns which I love
bull horns was really taking my
Maybelline fit me concealer just you can
seal underneath my brows today that I'm
sort of running across my eyelid we'll
deal with that afterwards and all I do
is I'm scrubbing a little flat top brush
like this
then I'm going to take my damp beauty
blender and I'm just going to start
blending that out and just in dabbing
motions Gorge simply Gorge Gorge
go George George and now just set the
concealer with any sort of translucent
powder now literally aching to go into
my warm brown color but we're going to
do a grey like really dark smokey eye
today that's the look that I'm going for
so it's going to take my makeup geek
shadows I'm gonna be taking this one
here I forget what it's called but I
leave all the products they use down
below in the description so all the
colors of the eyeshadows that I use will
be down in the description so I'm going
to take up light sort of brown color on
a Zoila two to four crease brush tap off
the excess that you don't need and
I'm just going to start going into my
crease with that
so the last video that I put up you guys
I don't know if it was you guys all
those other people but it got so many
dislikes and I don't think people liked
my favorites video because I didn't do a
voiceover I didn't talk about I just
wanted to do something differently but I
just wanted to change it up a little bit
like I just wanted to see how everyone
liked it and obviously I'm never going
to be doing it again because nobody
liked it you know I just wanted to you
know be a little bit more different and
a little bit artistic but obviously you
guys like it when I do talk throughs and
voiceovers and stuff like that so I'm
just going to stick to that from now on
I'll probably never do a video again
with like not me talking in it like that
I'll go back to my old way of doing the
favorites videos and talk about the
products rather than just show them now
so the go image is darker grey color
right here this one yeah and I'm just
going to define that a bit more before
we go in with a really darker sort of
black color now I'm just gonna be going
in with corrupt which is the black color
up here this is looking absolutely
gorgeous I don't it up Rimmel black
gel liner okay I'm gonna be putting that
all over my eyelid it's just like so dry
it up it's like I'm scared it's not
going to blend out before that dries you
know too much I'm just gonna go back in
with corrupt on my blending brush and
just try and blend that whole area out
that I've just done I'm actually just
going to my morphine 12z palette and
take the black shade out of that one
just here just on this little Sh annex
Oh small blender brush
okay I'm just going to do the other eye
and I'll be back in a sec now we're
going to be taking my benefit
Porefessional and applying that all over
my face because the best primer I have
ever used in my life
I specifically focus up on my forehead
even though again I just got Botox all
across um my forehead here so I've got
like no lines at all there's just a few
little tiny ones but I'll get some more
put in there just because I want it like
super super smooth so I have to worry
about my forehead lines anymore you guys
probably noticed that well probably not
because I'm probably the only one who
notices it but I used to get a lot of
forehead lines um in my you know videos
where I did makeup in that and it would
just look like lines all across here and
it just looks so disgusting
I think stuff you know so I don't have
to worry about it as wole what happened
ah got to brush away my fallout I'm
actually so scared to do the book like
underneath my eyes because I always do
my face first and then I drew under the
eyes but if I bake a lot and put a lot
of powder on I should be okay where the
 is all this black coming from it's
like everywhere Oh before we do
foundation I'm just going to get my
Maybelline concealer again just on the
top part of my brows and just a flat top
brush again and I'm just going to
conceal the tops of those once they're
all concealed on something very straight
in with my foundation and today I'm
going to be using the Tarte Amazonian
clay 12-hour full coverage Foundation
funding tinted coverage con plague at 12
hour dent on NRG Amazon II found a ssin
this foundation is so thick I don't know
if it's gonna you know do what I wanted
to do let's just go straight in with a
Beauty Blender now the other day I
bought this Maybelline age rewind
concealer in the shade light pale
Maybelline had 40% so I was like why not
and I always see deals makeup use this
so I thought why not get on the
bandwagon even though this is been going
around for so long that it's a really
good concealer finally decided to buy it
so I'm just going to crack her open and
see how she goes why just don't know how
to get open oh
ah sorry struggles of having acrylic
nails you can't open anything
without tweezers but okay oh my god
Tom many turns do I have to do it bomb
okay Gorge
however I was like wow that's a lot
better you know I can feel up but um you
know you want need to get my fixed plus
hold up for a sec so I'm just going to
spray my beauty blender with some fixed
plus and now I'm just going to go
straight in on in there
now for some reason I feel like there
isn't enough up there goes to be like
that now I need to set all of my
concealer I'm going to bake it and I
need to set the rest of my foundation as
well so to bake I'm going to be using
the crude es bun powder link down below
to where I got this because everybody
asked me where I get it from you can get
up from eBay or beautybay and other
places as well straight on the damp
Beauty Blender if you guys don't do this
it literally melts into the concealer
you
as you can tell I bake a lot I eat a lot
too now to set the rest of my face I was
going to taking my Australis fresh and
flawless this is in the shade natural
because the foundation I'm wearing is
quite thick I'd like hashing this in one
of my most favorite part about doing my
makeup is contouring and bronzing
because it changes the shape of your
face and cuts off all the fat which is
exactly what I need so I'm gonna be
taking a Mac it give me some bronzer and
I'm going to lay this down before I
contour just so there's more powder
there and it gives me more of a base to
like contour leave if that makes any
sense so I'm just going around the outer
corners of my face like up in this area
and try and blend the bronzer into your
hairline because it looks so much more
not natural because this is not natural
at all but it just looks better if you
blend it into your hairline and when
you're taking it under my jaw a little
bit not that I have one but I'm going to
make one oh and the brush I'm using is
benefit to new bronzer contour brush
bingo
just kind of make a new chin if you want
as well just contour under that and up
the sides here this bronzer is
absolutely amazing now to contour it up
a little bit more I'm gonna be taking my
makeup geek contour shades everything
the shade this is called half-hearted
OSC deals makeup use this I'm like we
kind of have the same skin tone but
Dill's is a little bit darker so we're
just going to go with half hearted
because well just make it looks amazing
so so just straight in with that
okay so now I need to finish my eyes so
I'm gonna go straight back even my
makeup geek shudders again in with the
lighter shade once again and straight
onto my eye
now back in with the morphe palette I'm
just going to take the black color out
of there and add a little bit more to my
lower lash line so underneath my eyes I
just kind of went with the gray a little
bit more and just kind of blended it
down now I'm going to be taking my
makeup geek cream pencil in the color or
both did obe
Bob CD on which is like a black and it's
really creamy so it's good to blend so
I'm just going to tightline my eyes with
that and we'll go to a line camera
because I'm gonna look like a complete
bucket so I'll be back in a sec so I've
tight line my eyes now I'm just gonna be
going back to the morphe palette once
again and I'm going to be taking the
black color and kind of blending that
cream down a little bit now that we've
done the eyes completely besides lashes
and mascara I can now dust off all this
bake here which is what I'm gonna do now
I'm just going to contour my nose a
little bit and I'm just gonna go and
give me some of the bronzer
I'm going to put a little bit of product
under my bottom lip just to make it a
little bit bigger but I need to okay I'm
pretty happy with that let's move on to
eyelashes I'm just gonna be taking my
Mac extended play gigablack lash mascara
for lashes today I'm gonna be using
Lily lashes and I'm pretty sure these
are called Vegas I'll leave it down
below exciting it and to glue them what
I was going to be taking my house of
lashes black lash glue is my Holy Grail
lash glue
all the different elastin make also to
set my brows in place I'm just going to
be taking this Mac of brow set this is
 incredible it's like hairspray
in a bottle and for highlighter today
I'm gonna be taking Becca's champagne
pop and I was going to be spraying a
little bit of mac fix+
on the end of my brush form form
now for a bit of a pop of color I'm just
gonna be taking makeup geeks pigment in
the shade wildfire and a little bit of
Too Faced glitter glue on the inner
corner and then popping that off and
then straight in with wildfire by makeup
geek and then just over the top of that
a little bit of Becca's champagne pop
now for lip slams can be dipping into my
Lesage liquid lipsticks I just got these
the other day and this is the color I'm
going to be using is called lady lavish
