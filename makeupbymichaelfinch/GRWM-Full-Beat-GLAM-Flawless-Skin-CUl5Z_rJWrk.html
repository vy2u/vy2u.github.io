voice I come a little bit not flee if
that's what it's called sorry today I
have literally not put makeup on in a
few days like bein sick there's not
really a plane just felt like sorry

it all back to life sorry I'm gonna be
doing a fuller glam black smokey eye get
ready with me I don't know what's gonna
happen I don't know what I'm gonna look
like I just got all these products and
I'm just gonna with them and put
them on my face and heart for the best
let's get taking let's get taking
 how I hate being sick so much it
is so draining now for some reason
weapons think I have broken out quite a
bit all over my face
I haven't wreckin out for ages like
everywhere so kind of weird but whatever
nothing that foundation of a bit of
skincare can't fix so for my brows today
I'm just gonna be taking the UH
nostalgia brow pomade in blond and
chocolate mixing them together I'm
slapping it on my face and boom there's
a brow I'm kind of glad that I got sick
now because I've just got so much coming
up in the next few weeks rather than any
other time so if anything this was the
best time to get sick so my eyebrows are
on and these thick are
back if you don't like you I'm sorry but
I love them okay so now you can seal the
brows a little bit we're just gonna take
some this this is just like a concealer
palette from a brand called OPV I just
got to have a box of their stuff a few
weeks ago so it's kind of like concealer
as well which is what I'm gonna use it
for and the matte matte Brown if I can
find the right brush to do this
with I'll be very happy so I'm just
gonna be taking this light shade here
and you're basically concealing under my
brows
now don't be disgusted if you sing black
on my beauty blender it's just a line on
not mold so calm it down vomit but
concealer on my eyes today I'm just
gonna be using my favorite eyeshadow
base slash concealer which is the Urban
Decay Naked skin concealer and this
shade in the shade fair neutral
literally paint entire eyelid you want
to see no skin tone under this that is
how you get the flawless base to your
shadow but I'm just gonna take my damn
Beauty Blender just so that doesn't
crease or move and then just taking this
banana powder this is from Earth for
cosmetics I'm still just put this in a
zine palette and I'm just gonna set my
eyelid the storage doesn't create
specifically very much through the
crease is gonna help it no crazy Apple
okay now we're gonna do this skin first
don't know why I don't know what to
clean the under the skin first what
we're going to I'm just gonna dip
straight into my benefit Porefessional
professional benefit the Porefessional
matte rescue prime now this isn't the
original profesh this is kind of like
their new primer you guys are saying is
it before if you're been watching my
videos for a while and I'm just gonna
spread that all across mmm okay
the red eye guard however tomorrow how
are you just before we go any further
I'm just gonna take that concealer
palette that I used earlier and tank
- skintone color so probably this baby
right here
once they stop they can say let's do
founding soul star I'm just gonna do a
pond I'm gonna use buff and neutral
beige mixing them together from the back
of my orange can't stop nothing there's
gonna be so many like cuts in this video
it because seriously I'm copying every
on and on three seconds Monterey Bay oh
yeah
basically I was gonna paint on my face
right then I'm just taking my damn pass
Beauty Blender again spritzing of my
Beauty Blender again just with a bit of
setting spray by Urban Decay because
I've got 90 plus left and I'm just
squeezing that and just patting motions
only do not swipe your beauty but now
some people like to which is okay
whatever works for you but honestly it
just moves the product and you just want
to tap it in then that gives you the
most flawless application so what's
everyone been doing tell me everything
has anyone seen the conjuring number two
yet I saw it the other day and there was
a bitch in the cinema who would not stop
screaming and everything in it scared me
more honest than the movie scared me and
I was getting so angry but overall the
movie was good like I loved paranormal
stuff but it scares the out of me
one really big tip that I do have that
everyone is waiting to foundation a lot
of you would already know this but some
might not is blend it in to your
hairline if you've got white blond hair
do it anyway and just use bronzer
because it will cover up the foundation
this but um blend it into your hairline
it's like the most important thing ever
now I'm just gonna be doing a little bit
of cream contouring but I'm gonna show
you guys that in a separate video cuz
I'll make a separate video about it
someone's gonna go ahead and do it and
you guys will see in the next video when
I decide to do cream contouring sorry
for tonight skin steel up I'm gonna be
using the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer which is the same that I used
on the top of my eyelids and I have also
seen you guys in a little bit just thing
a little bit closer so you know what I'm
saying
I'm gonna take my damp Beauty blender
and blend that the out I'm kind of
glad that it's raining outside today
because
I enjoy the rain plus I'm weird so
didn't it's not weird that I enjoy rain
is that so I'm just gonna do my nose
bridge and a little bit on my forehead
they've been on this chin right here
hello chin
yo my confidence my garage since having
a cold it's like just blending out my
new chick good morning chin every
freaking form order more north could
feel I put too much on bra it's like not
that right I don't know what's gotten
into me today maybe I'm just feeling
better about the whole sickness cold
disappearing so to sit under my eyes
today I'm just gonna be taking the s-1
pallet micro teen and I'm gonna just
take my damn Beauty Blender I'm actually
just gonna dampen that up a little bit
more cuz the wetter the better and I
would just make sure that's blended
before I set it straight into my ass bun
so once your bank is on I then just want
to set the rest of my face before I move
on to my eyes because I just don't want
anything to be wet wear eye shadow can
fall because that's just what you don't
want in life I'm gonna take this big-ass
lookin ass brush this is the stuff for
our mineral powder foundation which
always would run out of need to get more
