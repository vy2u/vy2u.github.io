insides like cuz honestly I'm sick
because you're oh wait breakfast lunch

Salam's alright festival nerd I've been
eating sorry healthy lately healthy
lately okay
you came over the other day and you were
like I just had a whole pack of bounties
like the whole packet are you right okay
walk I'm never bringing back that was so
embarrassing I notice that it like all
the things you says like bad but like
what was it again what box from we're
not private Journal you said it wants
unto your breath but I didn't hear so it
doesn't count
yeah I was taking the piece anyway you
couldn't clean your house if you laughs
 depended looks serious I always
clean my house no you don't yes I do
um no you don't mean Dee look literally
on the fine to Cali soon as bindi takes
a can you clean down outrage
sorry sure it's a joke oh wow this is
sorry pretty
no one actually can know but like
seriously like I feel like we've got the
same eye color going look the different
products look are you copying me
you're calling me well I had this on
fast I had blue one first so that's a
really awkward sorry why did we hurt
each other oh okay so I'm like really
uncomfortable right now don't tell me I
mean I really want to know the first
thing that I want to say is I'm kind of
upset that Michael only wants to talk
about it on camera not because the
problem well it was a problem yeah but
like the fact that you're talking about
it now not lack well I think it's good
because the whole internet picked up on
it and
I did what you did because you told me
to delete the comments oh you have a
fire and you walked in and you were like
because it's true
oh my god it's so uncomfortable really
yeah why I was really upset okay can you
tell me why you were really upset yeah
okay okay I'm sorry I hate my life
why tell me cuz we've never had a fight
before so it's like we had well we never
actually had a fight we just didn't talk
to each other sorry what a night war was
about well I just feel like he always
like put me lost like randomly and I
just felt like yeah off that is the
biggest lie no you know okay this is my
this is my thing of the whole story we
were all at Brisbane Airport yeah and
you were going in business class and all
the most peasants were growing economy
Acts yeah and as soon as we got off the
plane you literally didn't even look at
me didn't say a word to me and then ever
since then that's where it'll be gone
and the whole of America there was like
a solid day when we didn't talk to each
other and I still don't know why well
because like before I got on the plane I
was having a fight with my mum and I was
always not talking to anyone you knew
that you knew that I was upset because
you message me and said baby oh okay
yeah I knew I was upset yeah and I was
like yeah asking higher okay yeah but
you didn't like I was like no I'm flying
cause like I don't want to talk about it
because I was by myself and like you
asked me like Erbitux so it's just like
 it that's cuz you were in the line
by myself
yeah that's because you were going in
business class rule-breaking separate
lines I went through I was waiting at
the gate by myself at a different line
no I was thinking the corner no you were
standing up in a different line no I saw
you from I remember and then that
because when we got off the plane I
backtracked and I'm like why would she
be so like shitty well I was just upset
about like mom and like people fighting
sure and then you didn't like care that
all the upset I was like whatever it's
Michael like I don't really care I mean
you know I always care when you're upset
I just don't know how to show
that I am worried like I'm really not it
you know that and it's really I just get
really awkward you know that that's why
I don't like talking about problems and
like I'll talk to other people about
their problems but like I just I'm not
good at it like you know that I'm not
good at it I didn't know that you
weren't good I just what you didn't care
I'm gonna totally did Karen's my text to
Jerry well I put it off and like you
didn't even like obviously you said that
I didn't look at you you literally walk
straight in the front I was crying that
whole flat I can't that's dramatic I
literally was crying I was like this is
gonna be the worst stalking trip you
know before I got on the flight I texted
John even though we're broken off and I
was like can I get off this flat like
can I get a refund but it was like
$8,000 for the flash yeah I know it was
I think it was Ronnie was telling me
that you tried to get a refund for your
flats I'm like what the why see you
would have known but I didn't but like I
didn't click on as to why he wanted a
refund like I didn't realize what I'd
done that was you know bad enough for
you together anyway okay so when you
walk straight in front of me cut me off
and walk in front and walk with everyone
else and didn't say a word to me no but
like there's also more so like when we
got to America oh here we go
um like Michael would talk to everyone
except me like he literally said
someone's name before he said something
just so he wasn't like talking to me so
like I literally slip gun says the whole
time like by myself cuz I'm like I'm not
dealing with this so I just say
downstairs and like everyone was giving
hate to Michael for leaving me out no
they weren't no they weren't no one ever
said anything to me that whole trip no
no no our friends I mean in the comments
and like I didn't delete any of the
comments cuz I'm like maybe Michael will
like get it once he sees a little
comment oh yes sir he like as I was
saying like he when he went to say
something like Oh Ronny and then he
would say something and like when I was
right there like just so he knew I
wasn't talking about him oh but like I'm
swimming up to me as well well yeah cuz
I was so upset because you didn't care
but I did care I just didn't realize
what I died you would have been like
what's wrong like you just won't pass me
and you didn't even like you caught me
off let me go wow I caught you off so I
like let's ignore trying for two weeks
well you did it back how long ago is
that was that like a year
that was our year guard yeah I agree
with your buddy let's just talk about it
when we can get paid for it
bring with me because you always like
make sure your friends are okay a
hundred percent but I I like a mate sure
you are okay like a un hey-oh saying are
you okay once is that exact enough okay
we'll have I improved well yeah I don't
know why you just stopped caring about
my problems in so weird what what I'm
crapping that out that's I mean no it's
true
that's so mean it's not all of a sudden
you know I'm always cared so
you're canceling I think we need to just
both go to counseling to get ourselves
fixed and scream scream the office down
and then leave and then everything's
gonna be fine that's pretty much all
that I have to say about that so do you
have anything else to say I'm really
sorry oh my god really apologize for
cutting me off is absolutely not
alright will I take that apology back
okay okay relax
 SeaWorld eyes but um yeah I'm
never one to about that ever again and
I'm happy as apologize and I'm moving on
because we sometimes a bad friend but
it's okay cuz you make me an officer
it's worth it I'm never don't say I'm a
bad friend I just think what you don't
really know how to be a good friend
no no you know I'm not saying always you
literally I'm just saying like when
feelings are involved I think like when
arguments and suffering both you and me
yeah just run that's all I just wrong
yeah yeah that's true and that never
happens like that only happen once so
it's like I'm not saying
thank you so much bye okay first of all
I was like so nervous and that like I
didn't even do anything so just give me
like five minutes oh by the way yeah one
more thing
I've made like three videos about
Michael now what yeah but he never
notice you're lying
have you actually yeah I don't know cuz
I don't watch your videos you don't
watch my not sure by the title was fake
friends it was like it's something about
friends okay Wow I said you should
always keep your family close because um
you never know when your friends are
gonna just stop being messy hey I've
always been there for you and you know
that and you've told me that and that
was probably the one time yeah that I
wasn't am I gonna get all of the people
who hate me and everyone here loves you
to come and abusing yeah that's good um
let's just see what people say because
I'm confident that I'm not in the wrong
but I'm sure people can understand where
you coming from
yeah I mean probably not because you are
Beyonce after all haha by the way guys I
literally had concealer on my face
because I went out for breakfast this
morning my pimple is a really bad sir
mystery I'm doing a runny merriment
yeah I love that raggedy rani
every time she went out like even too
cold she did my makeup no no she's like
I'm just gonna put some scar on ah
Jupitus are you doing all you're doing
is now I think I'm gonna put some lashes
on what do young lashes what do you say
lashes lashes I think I don't know where
they stop every time I go shopping with
Michael just because I buy materialistic
things doesn't mean I'm not humble okay
when we was talking to Gabby on the bite
room in making us yeah he actually told
me why he does that
okay and I'm not even mad
laughs okay what I'm always like Michael
like you need to save for a house like
you've got to like you know stop looking
after yourself for the future and then
you were telling Gaby that when you were
in school you'd always buy like fake
things and I guess like I didn't think
he even said this I think I think this
you tried to get like approval maybe
from like is that why you bought it
cause like you know who thought it was
cool no I thought it was cool to have
back then because I always feel like Kim
K with it and everything and like all
like the Mescalero and I used to read
like all the massive magazines and like
go through everything you know just say
like that out of a print you know sort
of what like when Holly was like so big
back yeah and then that bad not be mine
it's not okay good
and I'm yeah I just think it's cool that
I can buy the real thing now so I just I
just I've slowed it down though admit
that actually I have in my I shudder I
went to house the other day and
literally blew up in my bank account if
