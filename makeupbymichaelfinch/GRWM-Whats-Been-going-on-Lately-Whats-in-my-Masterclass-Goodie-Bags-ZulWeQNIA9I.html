hope you're all doing super super well
so today I just wanted to sit down and
chat to you guys about a few things that
have been on my mind lately and also I'm
gonna be showing you guys if you are
coming to my master classes if you
didn't know I'm having master classes
all around Australia in Melbourne Sydney
Brisbane Perth Adelaide I'm trying to
think of them off the top of my head
because I saw many and I'm so excited
and also Auckland as well so I'll be
leaving all the dates and information
about my master classes down below if
you are interested so today I'm just
gonna be like doing my makeup and just
chatting to you guys about a few things
that have been on my mind lately I
haven't really done one of these videos
in such a long time where I've just
talked about my feelings because I am a
human I do have feelings too but I
really like to keep my YouTube like a
positive sort of place to you guys to
come to I don't want you to come watch
my videos and you know feel sorry for me
or like Phil down or anything like that
I want you to finish watching my video
with a happy vibe but today we're just
going to do things a little bit
differently and at the end of the video
I will be showing you guys what is in my
masterclass goodie bags and I'm so
excited because I have some amazing
sponsors and I cannot wait to share them
with you without any further ado let's
get straight into it
so I'm just gonna get straight into my
eyebrows first and I'm just gonna be
using the benefit precisely my brow
pencil now you guys know if you've been
following me for a while this is my
favorite eyebrow pencil I literally
never use anything else for my brows
except benefit that's just that's just
how it is so what has everybody been up
to I have been working my actual ass off
and you know I've got my master classes
coming up I've got the first one this
Sunday in Melbourne on the 26th of
November and I've never done anything
like this before it's completely
different I'm really nervous but at the
same time I've got to get used to that
feeling of it's actually excitement not
nervousness but it's just that I'm new
to it completely so I'm really happy
that I'll have it you guys there or some
of you guys there who have bought
tickets to my Melbourne one with me to
go through everything with me I'm really
excited to see how everything plays out
but yeah it's just been on my mind a lot
lately because as I said it's something
new that I haven't done before it's
exciting but it's a little bit
nerve-racking at the same time do you
know what I mean but it's gonna be
really good I can just tell and for
those wondering who my model is going to
be at the Melbourne masterclass it is
going to be none other than miss Lilly
Brown I'm so excited she has the most
beautiful face to do makeup on so yeah
so I've just concealed under my brows I
got my brows done yesterday oh my god
they look so much better I'm just going
to conceal over my lid just using the
top shape tape
now what else is being going on um
there's been actually a lot of like
going on too like behind the scenes with
me and like friends and like stuff like
that I just really don't know what I
should talk about on my YouTube and what
I shouldn't talk about on my YouTube but
I'm gonna talk about this one thing in
particular because honestly like it's
just so unfair how things play out and
it really does suck so let's go so
pretty much I was friends with this guy
and I don't really want to give away I'm
not gonna be mentioning names obviously
if you guys just want to work it out you
saw what you can but if there's any
comments that are left in the comment
thing guessing who it is I'm just gonna
delete them because I don't want to let
this person have any hate or anything
like that but pretty much I was friends
with this person and they were very
friendly towards me and very nice and
you know I was very sass about this
person like did their only one followers
like I just didn't know and I started
getting feelings for this person pretty
much you guys already know that it's a
guy now that I've said that but I
started getting feelings for this guy
and he was sending me mixed signals like
a really like strong mixed signals like
love hearts and like exes and like no
other guide talks to another guy like
that unless there's something going on
with your sexual orientation do you know
what I mean and I spoke to my friends
about it they were like yeah what the
 anyway then pretty much what
happened after that was he just
literally cut me off completely cut me
off and I was left literally ha broken
because there was no contact for months
and yeah everything pretty much just
turned to and like that was on my
mind a lot and it isn't really much I
could I guess I could do about it
because you obviously can't help what
someone else was thinking or feeling or
you know what their intentions are but
yeah there's a little bit more to it but
I don't really want to get into detail
but that happened and that really
with my head a lot um so that really
wasn't the best thing in the world as
you could probably imagine I know
there's people with worse things going
on out there and it sucks what I have to
always just claim this but I'm a person
too I have feelings I'm allowed to talk
about them so yeah that happened but
that's over now and I'm done like I
spent so much money on this guy like I
have so much regret and everything was
just completely fake and like nothing
was genuine and it really upsets me
because as I said I wasted so much money
on this guy and I feel like sending him
a invoice being like this is for
everything that I bought you you
 do you know what I mean like
that's what I want
do it but I won't okay anyway moving on
to something positive I'm gonna be
testing out Kat Von D's new eyeshadow
palette today this is the I don't really
know what it is but it's a palette and
it looks stunning I don't really know
what to do should be honest I'm gonna go
in with this shade here I really forgot
to set my eyelids cuz I was talking
about that do you know what I mean like
it really with my head so much ah
anyway sorry for you guys these
eyeshadows ah sorry pigmented like this
Brown car I've just put down is so good
and the black that I've just put over
the top of that is also so good and
they're blending out I'm just blending
it now oh my god they're blending out so
well
amazing I don't really know what I'm
doing with this eye look guys I'm just
kind of playing with it and just seeing
what kind of happens I kind of want to
do a really nice green color on my
eyelid um I'm trying to think what else
I can talk to you guys about um a lot of
people keep asking if I'm still friends
with Shani I mean yes I am a hundred
percent just because this is the thing
about like being a youtuber and having
friends that are also in the same
industry as me I feel like a lot of the
time if you don't post everything on
social media that you drew together like
if you're having breakfast together and
you don't post about it people are just
gonna automatically assume that you guys
aren't friends anymore that you've had a
falling out or if you post a snapchat
with a song in the background that's to
do with fake friends people are just
going to assume that it's about this
person or this person or this person but
really that's not how it is at all it's
just silly to me to be honest um for
example I haven't seen my friend you
know sky lately I haven't seen sky in so
long just because she's been busy with
her own life and I've had things on
people just speculate that we're not
friends anymore and that we've had a
falling out but that's totally not true
not everything has to be posted on
social media and I really really like
the fact that not everything does have
to be posted on social media also you
guys you do deserve to know if I do have
a falling out with a friend or something
like that and if that ever did happen I
would tell you about it hence like what
I told you about at the start of the
video because you guys have a right to
know because you guys do follow in my
life
and you honestly have a right to nari
there are some things that should be put
on the internet and some things that
shouldn't but if something as simple as
having a falling out with a friend if
that ever happened you guys are gonna be
the first to know about it because as I
said again you have the right to know
this video is not something that I am
used to that's right because I like
talking about stuff like this I love my
friends
sorry much like you know all friends
always argue and they have little
miscommunications I'm not saying that I
have had an altercation with anyone in
the past months or anything like that
but I'm just gonna take this green shade
from the palette that's nice cool okay
moving on to primer I'm just gonna be
using the benefit Porefessional and I'm
just putting that all across my face
should get ready for a nice smooth base
what else has been happening oh that's
right
another thing I've actually got merch
available at all of my tours as well
you'll only be able to pay with f plus
so there won't be cash on a cash option
available they'll just be F pause sorry
if that affects anyone but that's the
only way we can pretty much do it we
have t-shirts phone cases all that sort
of stuff if you guys telling me up on my
other social medias I'm sure you would
know that I did do two exclusive Prix to
a merge drop so we did one a few days
ago and one a few weeks ago and for
anyone who did buy them they will be
sent off at the end of November or the
start of December I said it on the
website as it was a pre to a merge drop
and you will all be notified when
they're sent off cannot wait for you
guys to get them in the post because so
many of you guys bought them I was blown
out of the water with how many people
purchased my merch it was just like it
was really overwhelming and I was so
happy with the result and you guys are
incredible
that really does blur your skin like it
really gives it a nice
bass okay time to foundation I'm gonna
be using these ua essential high
coverage cream foundation this is easily
one of my new favorite foundations it is
so buildable it's literally the same
coverage as the Marc Jacobs foundation
but it's you know it's a thinner
consistency so it doesn't feel like
you're wearing a lot of makeup which I
absolutely love because the Marc Jacobs
one literally is so thick I still think
it's a great foundation however this
gives the same coverage and it's a lot
thinner which I really do like this is
in the shade shell it's perfect for my
skin tone and the coverage is just like
amazes me every single time I use it
like to me that just looks absolutely
incredible amazing I love it I love it
so much
just concealing I'm just using the Tarte
check tape again are you shocked though
are you shocked there um anyway let's
talk about something a little bit more
positive this year so far for me has
been literally one of the best years of
my life if you guys didn't know which
you probably do YouTube is my job now it
has been my job for the past I don't
know year and a half so I don't have
like a another job this is just what I
do I just do this I am incredibly
grateful for when I started when I did
because these days everyone wants to be
a youtuber which is I think that's
amazing and the fact that everyone wants
to do YouTube like apparently I was
watching someone's video the other day
and apparently the number one career
choice of people in school like when
they're asked in school what they want
to be when they're older he's a youtuber
and to be honest I think that's amazing
because YouTube is an incredible job and
I encourage absolutely everyone to do it
eventually everyone's gonna have a
YouTube channel like everyone has an
Instagram it's just how it is it's just
how it's just gonna work so eventually
every single person one day I can almost
guarantee is going to own a youtube
channel and is going to be creating
content for the world to see which to me
I think that's really really cool
because with YouTube it is an incredible
platform for you to express yourself and
as I said I didn't expect this to turn
into a job but it has and I'm extremely
grateful for that my face literally just
looks so flawless this foundation and
this concealer literally there
everything they're just everything is
what my dishwasher can you shut up
please thank you um I'm so excite I
don't know what that noise is I think
it's the wind it's really windy and
Brisbane today I kind of love it
yeah I'm just so grateful to be on
YouTube and I love every single one of
you guys who watch my videos whether
you're a hater and you still watch my
videos whether you subscribe just to
dislike my videos thank you it's still a
writing go for I really don't care
I'm just so content with life at the
moment like putting all the negative
 aside everything is just incredible
and I'm extremely extremely grateful for
what I have
okay guys I'm just gonna bake underneath
my eyes with the Maybelline setting
powder it's the best if you're in
America you need to get it because it is
 incredible my moods completely
changing throughout this whole video at
the start it was kind of down but now
that I've spoken about it I feel so much
better I feel like I'm gonna talk to you
guys about more stuff like that
because I want to help other people if
you're going through similar struggles
or anything like that I want to help you
as well as tell you about what's going
on in my life if that makes any sense
now to set the rest of my foundation I'm
gonna be using the makeup forever
professional Paris Pro finished powder
foundation is that I've been loving
this to set the rest of my foundation
and I'm just gonna do just bash and just
set everything else so it just does not
move and it stays put where it's meant
to say you know what I mean love love
love love love love love I love it when
you have those makeup days where
everything just works out like so far so
good I'm really happy with how this
looks I haven't ly done a green eye
before but I'm loving this a lot contour
I'm just gonna go in with my it
cosmetics contour palette I've been
loving this a lot lately as you can
probably tell have been using it in a
lot of videos if you're after a new
contour kit that works a treat well work
straight for me I don't know if it will
for you this is everything this is what
the front of it looks like you sculpted
contour kit by heat cosmetics so I'm
just gonna start chiseling it out my
face like that just looks so blended and
nice like I just love this so much also
another thing I wanted to talk about is
YouTube and beauty gurus and
stuff like that beauty guru I hate the
term beauty guru like Gary just seems
like I'm not like a guru it's just I
know it's weird I'm just literally just
like a guy who puts makeup on and films
videos and upload them to YouTube that's
how I've seen myself um I'm getting kind
of bored like I'm not getting poured
with YouTube but I'm getting poured with
videos like I'm running out of ideas
do you know what I mean like James
Charles has come up with this idea that
um he went into like old hard to get his
makeup done they had to create a look
from Jacqueline Hills like a front of
Jacqueline Hills makeup and he went in
to alter he went into like Sephora I
think but he went to all these different
makeup stores and that's to me that's a
really cool video idea concept and I'm
obviously not gonna do that because
that's whose idea and it's already being
done but like I'm just struggling to
come up with ideas I just don't know
what to film anymore like I'm literally
like I'm run dry I'm run dry and
I I don't know what to film anymore what
do you guys want to see like what do you
want to say like I feel like I've done
everything but I haven't but I just
don't know what else to film so if you
do have any video requests for me that
you guys really want to see also if you
really video ideas and there is comments
below if you guys want to go through the
comments and thumbs up the one that you
like the most or something like that I'm
not too sure how it will all work but um
yeah everything's being done and I'm
kind of getting bored but I've won
obviously I'm gonna create keep creating
content because well I love it but yeah
okay guys so I'm just gonna take a
little bit of that green shutter mm-hmm
so hard to talk and yeah straight
underneath my eye just like that and
coal coal and then I'm some Texan with
that brown shade that I used at the
start of the video and just gently pop
that underneath and just kind of blend
that down is to add a little bit more
bronze enos to this look I'm just gonna
take the Physicians Formula butter
bronzer and I'm just gonna pop this all
over where I have contoured just to
deepen up the contour ever so slightly
or a lot if you like me you like to
absolutely just pack the out of
your bronzer on which I love doing and
it smells so good so just adding heaps
of this whistling is so happening it's
like the winds between the two doors
like out the front of my apartment it's
like
the wind and I'm over it and I've had
enough damn that smells so good I'm so
excited to do this lip combination I did
it the other night when I went out
clubbing and honestly this gloss that I
use stayed on the whole night it was
insane
now for mascara I'm just gonna be using
the benefit roller lash mascara just
gonna generously apply this and pop on
check mascara is on n lashes are now on
the lashes that I use today where the
mink lashes from Lily lashes in the
style Allah obsessed these are literally
probably I prefer these over the Miami
lashes this is like one of my first
times using them and I'm obsessed
I just look so natural but they don't
they just look I know they just look
amazing
okay what's next let's do some
highlighter so for my highlighter I'm
gonna be trying out the NARS man-ray
highlighter this looks absolutely
stunning it's like a nice gold hoping
it's not gonna be too dark for me at the
moment but we're gonna give it a whirl
and see what happens it's kind of like a
wet consistency so I'm just gonna take a
little bit of that on my brush okay I
might actually spray my brush a little
bit of the Topshop
Joy's skin mass and see if this comes up
a little bit better so it's a very
subtle eyeline I'm gonna spray my face
actually
oh yeah it's kind of showing up a little
bit better now but it's like a patchy am
I using this wrong or is it just a
really subtle highlighter I don't know
I'm just gonna use a bit of fix+ instead
and see how this goes
oh yeah that is a lot but I know we're
talking let's see if I can fix this side
up and you can't see that you're wearing
highlighter until you look to the side
which is good it doesn't have that
patchy looks oh yeah this is fixing it
up
oh yeah hey guys I take back what I said
about being subtle
he's just got to use some spray with it
and it works a absolute treat now just
to complete this look today I'm gonna be
using the address of colors supernatural
liquid lipstick this is the combo I did
the other night when I went out clubbing
and I'm just I'm I'm obsessed with it so
I'm just gonna put this on so it's kind
of like a warm and nude color which is
my fave okay so I'm gonna let this lip
color dry down before I go over with the
gloss which I don't know where I've
there it is haha just by that settling
I'm just gonna set my face and give it a
nice little jewy touch using the
attached ah
dry skin mist and then I'm just gonna go
in with this Sephora beauty amplifier
makeup setting spray cool look not a
warm term eyeshadow look for once we're
going good now that the liquid lipstick
is dry I'm gonna be taking the anastasia
beverly hills butterscotch lip gloss
this is sorry pigmented and when it
wears off it doesn't wear off because
you've got this underneath it and this
is still really pigmented anyway I'll
just show you okay so this is the combo
that I use the other night and I
literally fell in love with and I'm
still in love with it it's gorge okay
guys so this is the completed makeup
look now I'm gonna get into what is in
my masterclass makeup bags for those who

that out if you're interested okay so
here is the bag that every single one of
