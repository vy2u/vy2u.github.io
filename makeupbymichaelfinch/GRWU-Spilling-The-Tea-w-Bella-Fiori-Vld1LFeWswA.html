out the I thought two months guys I'm
gonna be testing out the laura mercier
translucent powder now a long time ago
I'm talking like two years ago
I actually used to hate this powder I
don't know really remember why I think
it's cuz it used to settle into your
five lines that's what I thought it did
but um I'm gonna give it a second guard
and see if I like it Walker from
national trials this week only you know
they did a remix of that so where I used
to live right they have like this club
that we always used to go because it was
the best we've quiet and they literally
made a remix of Frank Walker from
national trials and just walked out I
walk I'm not like gonna be on the dance
floor listening to this cuz that's
cooked in the head I'm gonna
bake my whole face with this Laura
actually I'm not gonna bake it but I'm
just gonna put it all over my actual
face because apparently it makes it look
really good okay so I'm just dusting off
the Laura mess yeah and honestly it's a
bit yellow you know what I've been
loving lately just it cosmetics you
sculptor contour palette okay it's sorry
 good yeah I'll be loving this
cool trend shade here for the soft
contour so it's like how do we mean yeah
me and Bella used to actually hate each
other didn't we yeah this is good drama
on the internet
but um you know I decided to get
involved in June but yeah I got involved
into it and there was a bit of you know
attention for quite a while yeah
I was like where's my message but we
want to talk about that too much but
then we saw Bala at an event and I went
up to her and I was like Heisman to
introduce myself and then we just hit it
off from there on - and you live in
Brisbane - so yeah like yeah yes I'm
getting it I'm pretty sure it's a bronze
another contour so I'm gonna use it as a
bronzer color pop line cuz it's very
warm tone but I like warming up my
cheeks after using a cool time so have
you ever had any bad experiences coming
before because I certainly haven't
really had bad experiences I've just had
you know people always called me a
 that's why I never women actually
yeah that one time that I went with you
and there was another time that I didn't
go with you but I was wearing makeup
that was last weekend and there was
people like I'm like you know I
just walked past people about what the
 is that
and I'm like this is why I don't wear
makeup go away because I just can't deal
with that
don't worry I got him picked out and he
got into a punch line with a security
guard I know it's actually a really
 fun
I could never go out to someone and be
like yo what the is that lack if
they yeah unless they mean to you but
even then she wrongs don't make a right
I agree but at the same time you're
allowed to defend yourself and stick all
for yourself yeah what the happened
I walked away so she like comes up to me
and she like look at my phone I just
thought it was someone that was like I
thought they were gonna follow
themselves and I was like okay like what
about and cuz they just took the phone
out of my hand I just didn't do anything
yeah and then they're like not what
happened they like lifted the phone up
to me and they're like why did you block
me on Instagram two years ago I was like
well I don't know like two years
goddamn yeah the to use and I was
like um I said to them I was like I only
block people who were rude to me and
then she like - says the same thing
she's like why did you block me two
years ago and then I'm like oh like I
really I like to touch her and I'm like
yeah and then um she's like don't
 touch me bitch
really so then my friend like gets in
between us after she said that I was
like what the hell she was like oh you
need a guard like you need to get out
and then she like pulls my friend to the
ground
then I like turn to her because I was
just like talking to another friend and
I like turn to her and I'm like you
should probably go like you're
embarrassing yourself
next thing I know she grabs my hair
pulls me to the floor holy
I hate violence but whatever I mean
people can just be jealous I know video
bitch it's actually embarrassing when
people like and then she like delete it
oh because I reckon she was
probably embarrassed I would beat you
after that like in my eye I just I would
be embarrassed if I got mad about
someone blocking me two years ago and
then tried to attack them in a club oh
