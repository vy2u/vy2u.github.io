channel so it is currently 6:15 in the
morning and I am getting ready for I
finish it today that we are doing for SG
the label um if you guys don't know it
we actually have he's a new much coming
out this was one of the shirt says hey
dill and it's orange and it's really
really cute
so I mean shiny are going to do that
shoot today so I'm just going to get
ready with you guys and do some full
coverage glam like I always do but um
it's gonna be extra full coverage to
make is you know photo shoot you see
needs to look like seamless fullest in
my opinion sir um yeah let's get into it
step one you guys know the drill I'm
just gonna take some of my top shape
tape in the shade like medium honey and
I'm just gonna put that all across my
lid area take it on that's what we're
gonna do today we're gonna take it on
now I have no idea what I look I'm doing
which probably isn't the best thing to
be doing cuz I should have a plan in my
head what I'm doing but I literally
cannot think of anything specific that I
want to do so I'm just gonna go ahead
and prep these lids and whatever happens
happens
okay Beauty Blender and then I'm just
gonna go to town oh my god I really need
to get my eyebrows done this little
blonde hairs happening and it's sticking
to of a concealer making it look like
chunky I don't like that now to set that
in place and was gonna take some of the
Australis fresh and flawless in the
shade darkest Brown alright guys so I'm
just gonna start off with this nude sort
of color and I'm just gonna start
putting this into my crease just on this
big a fluffy brush this is just from
makeup addiction
uh-oh my crease and kind of bring it up
this is just going to be used as the
transition for today the right amount of
quarter data all right guys sir I've
just kind of done at this I I just did
it off camera because I didn't really
know what I was doing and I kind of
wanted to work it out so now I'm gonna
show you how I did it was super super
easy I used about several different
colors though that's the only thing I'm
so first of all I'm just gonna take this
a brown shade and I'm just gonna pop
that below the crease this time I'm kind
of bringing that I should are a little
bit higher than I normally what is you
could probably tell here I'm just
blending that over my crease and then
I'm gonna go in with this darker brown
shade that's just pretty much just going
from light to dark of Browns until we
hit the black I'm just gonna pop that in
the out of the-- and just swipe across
slightly and then I'm just gonna take
this even darker brown shade and pop it
on me out of V everything's kind of
focused on the outer edge of the eye you
guys bring it up just create like a
little triangle you need out of corner
and ever so slightly bring it in just a
little bit then I'm just gonna take this
dark brown like maroon sort of shade and
once again I put on the out of 3 and
just focus it on the outer edge the
outer edge not the thing well it's kind
of buzz so whatever and now I'm going to
take the black just on this little brush
this is the XO Beauty small blender
brush this is so good for doing like
like detailed sort of eye looks it's
just sorry
precise and what I'm gonna do is focus
space on the outer corner and then
I'm gonna bring it up a bit higher like
and then we're gonna halfway across the
lid and then stop no I'm just gonna
focus on getting this blended out uh-huh
just taking that darker shade of brown
that I used prior to the black and I'm
gonna go back in with more of that black
and just kind of pack it on so it's
super super intense and I'm just gonna
blend it with a different brush just as
I got okay guys so now I'm gonna focus
on the I like eyelid area and I'm gonna
be taking the Engler AMC gel liner in
the shade 94 and what I'm gonna do is
just take a little brush and I'm gonna
like cut the crease
so guys when I get to this out of pot
here so it doesn't get patchy I kind of
just take the line on and just kind of
blend it into the shutter and then what
I like to just to take somewhere that
brown eyeshadow and just pop it on the
outer V and just kind of clean things up
a little bit in this case was going to
take a little bit of black and then just
pop that on there now to straight over
the top of this lid I'm just gonna take
thee or a highlighter in the shade
glazed or not and I'm just gonna pack
this so this is pretty much what we're
working with you guys and I'm pretty
happy with it so far okay guys so I just
put a little bit of liquid liner across
there really really really close to my
lash line
I guess it's cold and I just used the
Schwing eyeliner from the balm so I did
that off camera because you guys know
how did this going to do that sort of
stuff on camera cuz I always end up down
here and that's fact for everyone for my
lashes I'm just gonna pop on some roller
lash mascara from benefit there's
mascara never lets me down ela okay now
that that's all along the lashes I'm
gonna be using today after my brand cold
is the nasty of beauty and leave us
sorry beautiful I haven't actually tried
at this last brand yeah I got sent them
in PR the other day so they're something
like 10 of their different styles
shoutouts you guys if you are watching
this is what they look like
sorry pretty and fluffy and these are in
the style Bonita so I'm just gonna pop a
little bit of the clear lash glue from
house of lashes the reason why I'm not
using black today is because I'm
actually a little nervous to that I'm
gonna mess up this line are so I'm just
gonna put some clear lash glue on the
last band and then just stick it right
on where cars don't I'm just gonna pop
it straight on
perfect and then we have this lash ok
guys so my eyes are pretty much done I
also just did a little flick on the
inner corner just to kind of elongate my
eyes a little bit now moving on to
primer I'm gonna be taking the huda
beauty complexion perfection pre makeup
base and I'm just gonna be spreading
this and trim my hands and all over my
face now this is so like hard to move
around your face it has the consistency
of the lamia moisturizer it's so chic
and kind of like hard to get across your
face but I do like the tacky feeling
that it does give your skin because I
feel like the foundation really does
cling onto it so it's worth the
uncomfortable feeling of putting it on
my foundation because I want super super
SuperDuper full coverage I'm just going
to be using the jus a high coverage
foundation in the shade shell oh this
 is too good to be true too good to
be true I'm just gonna squirt some of
this onto the base of my mirror because
I don't have like a little plastic
sleeve and I don't want to put on my
hand till I put the tiniest little bit
of tan on last night good on your Bondi
sands thanks for coming through and I'm
just gonna start plastering this all on
now you guys know I use this foundation
and so many videos and I rave about it
because I truly truly believe this is
probably the best foundation that I've
ever used I feel like it can't get much
better than this at this point there's
so many foundations out there on the
market and I think this is just the best
one and a little does go a very long way
although I like to use a lot alright
guys so I've just kind of concealed the
tops on my brows just with the
foundation then what I like to do is I
just like to flick up all the foundation
to get it away so my Beauty Blender
doesn't hit the eyebrow and mess up all
my brows and the whole books gonna flick
that up like there then I'll just take
my Beauty Blender dip it into a little
bit more product and then just blend it
out I swear this makes your skin look
out of this world so for today I really
want to go for that really bright under
eye look so instead of using a darker
taut shaped tip I'm just going to use
the one in fair neutral which is more on
the more white sort of Casper the ghost
sort of side I'm just gonna pop that my
foundation kind of ghostly clump you
sometimes if I pack too much product on
there cuz I kind of sweat a little bit
from there I get a silhouette silhouette
those who don't know what that is
if you haven't seen wild child you need
to watch it but as Sula aware it's
called a sweaty upper lip alert and I
get that quite often and it's not cute
so a bit of this under my eye this is
gonna be so bright but I can tell that I
already love it damn Beauty Blender go
to town how cute is this orange strap
with disbelief background loving its
pimple right here just will not be
covered by absolutely anything today
sorry and it's gonna have to deal with
it because I want a really bright under
eye area today I want to look super
super smooth I'm just gonna be taking
the Maybelline fit me translucent powder
now if you've been living under a rock
you have not ever heard me talk about
this before wow that sounded really
conceited that's not what I meant
I'm just gonna be tipping that interior
the lid and then just absolutely packing
this of this out of this the under
eye area and the nose okay I'm just
gonna pack that like a little triangle
underneath my I always like to bake my
nose I don't know why I feel like it
just needs it always gets a little bit
oily there and I like to also bake I
don't really say this in video as much
but I like to go and baking those
creases of the nerves just so the
foundation doesn't slide out and look
like I've got me weak luck off creases
you're out the day you don't so I just
took a little break and had some
breakfast cuz I got super hungry but my
micro friend did cut out in the last
clip I don't know when it run out of
space hence why there could have been a
voiceover or no talking for a second but
we're just gonna keep going so pretty
much I've just gotta do underneath my
eyes now so I'm pretty much just gonna
do what I did on top same under the
bottom so I'm just gonna take a few of
the different branches
and then I'm gonna take some black on a
small definer brush and pop la straight
up against my lashline and kind of drag
it across not too much that I don't want
it to be too intense do you not I mean
and then I'm just gonna blend that down
then just to line my waterline UM's
gonna take the makeup geek obsidian
eyeliner pencil so once that's on I'm
just gonna wipe off the back that's
underneath my eyes with this brush here
just to set the rest of my face I'm just
going to take the Australis fresh and
flawless pressed powder and just set
everything else on my face so it does
not move whatsoever just passing it on
rather than swerving now just we finish
off my eyes I'm just gonna take the Mac
extended play gigablack lash and just do
my bottom lashes now to contour today
I'm just going with my pocket have
princess by Tarte contour blush and
highlight kit I'm just gonna be taking
in this shade here and I'm just gonna be
using my favorite contour brush at the
moment this is the morphe r14 and I'm
just gonna start chiseling out my face I
don't really know what to do with my
hair for today's shoot either I'm a
little bit confused I think I'm just
gonna wear it up like this but just
style it a little bit better cannot
forget to hit this jawline gotta make it
gotta make it now I'm some a slightly
contour my nose but I'm gonna do that
off camera I do have a full dedicated
video on how I do this I will leave a
link in the description and now just
taking one of my guru bronzers at the
moment this is the butter bronzer from
Physicians Formula I'm just going to
pack this on and warm up my face a
little bit more and i'm using the morphe
1 1 7 I think runs up you purse yes
bronzer your dick yes I'm gonna drag
this bronze off all the way down my neck
as well that was rude for a little bit
of color and blush in my cheeks I'm just
gonna be taking the Too Faced pop it
aren't peach blush just on my stipple
for your nipple brush yes this just adds
like a bit of a glow and a bit of color
it's got like a luminosity to it
so I'm just gonna add this on kind of
looks like this a bit of highlighter in
there as well it gives like a nice Sheen
to the cheeks if you liked that look
normally I'd ride I just great for like
I'm at blush but today we're changing it
up a little bit because why not I've had
enough of the matte blushes and
now for my highlighter today I'm just
gonna be going in with the Fenty Beauty
highlighter this is in the shade I'm
gonna be using the one cold fire
crystals are on this side here now the
brush I'm gonna be using today is the
morphe g36 it's so dense and intense but
just tap it lightly and it should be
fine so I'm sort of going with a little
bit and I'm just gonna build it off and
blend it as we go 1/2 my cheek and I'm
gonna bring it down to like this little
fat pad just here just so it really hits
when I'm facing straight on as well
there's honestly blends like a dream
there's a highlight it just reminds me
of Chris every single time I use that
I'm like kilowatt oh there that's all I
can think of by the way you guys y'all
are asking for a video with Chris again
it's coming because Chris is coming to
my house very soon um so we will be
filming and no doubt and I'm so excited
because Chris is one of my favorite
people to film with ever and even just
editing our videos together make me
laugh so much like I generally like love
it not that I don't enjoy filming with
my other friends but Chris is definitely
one of the phase now just taking a more
detailed brush I'm just gonna dip into
the highlight and just do the tip of my
nose and of course the bridge and now
for my lip color today I'm just gonna
wipe off this foundation and then for
lipstick today I'm just gonna you choose
something a neutral just saw doesn't
clash with anything that I'm gonna be
wearing on set I'm just gonna use the
mannequin and by Jeffrey star
holy I'm living just to give my
face a little bit more of the jury look
I'm just gonna take me mac fix+ just a
little bit of that just to get rid of
the cakey sort of powdery look and then
I'm just gonna take the draw Cosmetics
bio day in green tea slash ginger
they're just spritz okay cool we are now
done okay guys so this is the completed
and finished look I really like with how
this turned out

because I had no idea what I was doing

it but I'm really impressed with the end
result I am about to get picked up now
