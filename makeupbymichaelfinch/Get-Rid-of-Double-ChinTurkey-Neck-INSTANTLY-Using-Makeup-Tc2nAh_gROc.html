channel and if you are new did welcome
to my channel today I'm going to be
showing you guys how to go from this to
this so if you want to know how I did
this then stay tuned and keep watching
alright so basically what you want to do
first is lay down your favorite
foundation so I've already laid down
mine
I have laid down the lemare soft fluid
liquid where foundation gets in the
shade shell number 11 so I've laid that
down but I haven't done my concealer yet
because I want to show you guys on
camera because this comes under the
whole like highlighting and contouring I
guess so
when you highlight your face your
contouring it just all ties in together
I don't really know what I'm saying but
um yeah so I'm just going to take the
tight shape tight I'm just going to
highlight my face as I normally would
this one is in the shade fair beige so
it's like literally Wyatt alright and
I'm also just going to be putting it
where my contour is going to go over
like underneath it now it's going to
take my damper Beauty Blender here and
I'm just going to blend that this
conceal that all out
okay I'm not going to conceal my under
eyes just yet because I wanna get all my
liquids done before I move into powders
okay moving onto the next step I'm going
to be taking the Bobbi Brown this is a
skin foundation stick and this is in the
shade 5.25 called honey so basically I'm
going to be using this as a cream
contour up you know what I mean so I'm
gonna put it like this okay then I'm
going to put it on my jawline and kind
of drag it down under here I'm going to
bring it up around my chin then down the
sides of my face here because I want to
bring this in a little bit and then
obviously my big old jolly forehead and
then I'm also just going to bring it a
bit down the side of my nose and
underneath and a bit under my bottom lip
just for good luck
now I'm just going to spritz my face
with a bit of fix+ which is just going
to help blend everything together a
little bit better and then I'm just
going to take any sort of a random
stippling brush and I'm just going to go
to town and stipple this out so I'm
pretty much just doing it in little
circular motions just with a kind of
light hand because I don't want to
remove the foundation that's sitting
underneath this
okay what I'm going to do when I get to
my jawline contour is I'm going to drag
that foundation all down my neck so it
looks like a big-ass shadow I'm going to
kind of make my chin look a little bit
smaller and by bringing it up by the
side that's exactly what it's going to
make it look a bit smaller and I know my
bottom lip because it will give the
appearance of a bigger live not that I
need that but I'm gonna do it anyway and
the same on the other side
okay moving back onto my forehead I'm
just going to keep blending this in so
I'm kind of leading all this clear here
so it's like highlighted I guess and the
rest of the forehead is covered okay and
I'm just going to run this down the
sides of my nose if any of you guys are
interested I actually have a fully
dedicated video on my channel for nose
contouring so I'll leave that link down
below okay now all my liquids are done
I'm just going to take the Tarte shape
tape and I'm just going to put the
stroke under their eyes okay now I'm
just going to take my damp Beauty
blender and blend all this concealer
under my eyes now another thing when
doing your concealer if you bring it out
too far it's going to widen your face so
I always bring it out too far on purpose
but then I contour it back down because
I feel like it just the contour like
looks better it's it's better
canvas will take up stippling brush and
was going to quickly blend over the
edges of that concealer that I just laid
down just to make sure it's all
completely seamless now moving on cure
baking I'm just going to be using via
dermablend professional setting powder
and I'm just going to go straight
underneath my eyes with this now what
this is going to do is it's going to
really set that concealer and also it's
going to make it look a lot stronger so
your contour looks more intense I wasn't
going to include concealer in this video
but I feel like it really does come
under the category of contouring and
highlighting I'm also just going to plop
that powder exactly where I put the
concealer and now to set the rest of my
foundation I'm just going to take the
Australis fresh and flawless pressed
powder in the shade light beige and I'm
just going to lay this over everywhere
else now I feel like this step is so
important because if you put if you put
like contro hour or bronzer or anything
over like a wet concealer or foundation
it's not going to blend so you really
need to set it down with something so it
does it literally does not move now
moving into contouring so I like to
contour before I bronze
sometimes I forget and I just go
straight ahead with Rhonda doesn't
really matter but sometimes it does
because I feel like if you contour
before you bronze it doesn't go muddy so
today to contour I'm going to be using
the tarte park as princess contour and
it is the Amazonian clay matte
waterproof bronzer thoughts and matte
bronzer what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to take my morphe r14 brush and
I'm just going to start contouring away
now that Bobbi Brown foundation stick
that I put down is really going to help
with the whole contouring why because it
creates more shadow and there's more of
it
a base already laid down for your
powders to go over the top log I'm just
going to bring it up around my forehead
as I said before if you bring your
concealer too much you can just contour
it down so your face does look slimmer
this way rather than going out and
widening it now when it comes to the jaw
line which is literally my favorite part
I like to go like this and I'll run it
underneath like that and then just start
blending into the natural little line
that's on the back it is amazing
when it comes to under my chin I just go
like this put a whole lot of product
down put heaps of product down and then
I blend it on the side like this I'm
just doing exactly the same on at the
other side
just make sure when you contour your
jawline you really do run all that
contour all the way down your neck so
all the way down here now I'm just going
to contour my nose a little bit
off-camera but as I said earlier I do
have a fully dedicated video to
contouring the nose I'll leave that in
the description at the top okay so I'm
just going to finish off my forehead by
just contouring the outer edges and kind
of leaving all this space get clean
because that's going to bring attention
to the center of your face so it's kind
of getting close it all up
does that make sense okay now I guess
bronzer just come under the whole
category of contouring so I'm just going
to take my Marc Jacobs tantrik Omega
bronzer and just take a generous amount
of that and then I'm just going to go
straight over where contoured now what
this is going to do is are going to make
it's going to make it ten times more
intense and it's going to warm it up a
little bit it's going to give it that
warm sort of tone so bring some warmth
back to your skin because it's very cool
at the moment using that pack of
princess and once again just really
running it down my neck
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take a little bit more of that loose
translucent powder from dermablend and
I'm just going to run it underneath the
contour and just kind of wipe it off as
I go which is just going to clean up
that contour and kind of lighten
underneath it a little bit more and then
why I'm at that I'm just going to wipe
off my under I'd say so this is pretty
much the finished look as far as the
contouring goes big different a anyway I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video

me a massive thumbs up and don't forget

guys so much and I'll see you all in my
