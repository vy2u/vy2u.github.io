today I'm here with Alex Pike RN hi guys
so my name is Alex Pike RN so I've been
a registered nurse for well 13 years and
I've been injecting for 11 years
so I my my day consists of Botox
injections for my patients and and
dermal fillers so today we will talk
about Botox and what it is and how it
works and what's the best way to go
about it and we're also going to talk
about cost yes because that's what
everyone wanted to know in my last live
video yeah and my favorite thing to say
to people is that it is dose effective
so the higher the dose the longer it
lasts so we can actually work within
everyone's budget so what is Botox
well Botox is a purified protein and
it's actually been used in medicine for
sixty years so in the cosmetic world
it's been used for anti-wrinkle
injections for the past 20 years and
I've been injecting it for 11 so there's
been more studies and research done on
this drive than probably any other drug
it's extremely safe and it's used in all
different medical conditions next
question is what does Botox do and how
does it work well it's a purified
protein so it actually went when it's
injected it acts as a road block to the
muscle so over five days it doesn't work
instantly it takes between five and ten
days to kind of kick in and it smooths
the wrinkles and makes the skin appear
to be tighter
yeah yeah I did notice I took a few days
to kick in yeah which is normal some
people are funny though they'll let me
know and they'll say oh it started
working in the car park when I leave the
clinic you know and I'd say
nitin no it does take a few days to
start getting in so I can wake up every
morning you look in the mirror and then
you see like the difference that it
makes as the days go on that's what I do
I love joy yeah yeah so over the five
days if we treat your frown lines by day
five you'll go to the mirror room you
won't be able to frown yeah it's so good
so we're that's can we put Botox we
generally treat the upper face so frown
lines forehead lines and crows feet so
if you can frown for the everyone at
home just Fran so this is a frown so I
would inject into the muscles that
create the frown and over five to ten
days two weeks will effect it would just
elevate the brow and and Michael would
appear fresher I love it and tighter
okay so on my last live video that I did
everybody was asking me about the cost
so what is the cost of Botox so we
usually go on per unit so everyone has a
varying price per unit so we have a
minimum dose for Fran lights usually
around $300 the upper face for the
forehead line so just raise your vo so
to treat up here is usually about $80
and around the crow's feet between 250
and 300 so over time we've been
gradually increasing the size of your
lips yeah again I want to talk about
that today okay cool
so with your face it's all about when
someone's described as aging gracefully
or that they've got a great place that's
not it they're usually that the upper
they're made in their lower third is
very balanced and in Michaels case it
was not balanced because his lips were
really tiny so no matter what they used
to look like before I had them done you
guys will die yeah sorry you know my
father's very big eyes and you know
really big eyebrows obviously and he
knows well the nose is you know not
small but I would said to be but the
lips which is non-existent and this the
distance between the the lower lip and
the chin was better it was quite great
so I by increasing the size of Michaels
lips I've actually made his face more
balanced
yeah I love I can really notice it mmm
look at my lips the smaller my nose
looks yeah
so talking about what's aesthetically
pleasing the lips and the number one
thing you know
most patients come in and say are I've
got no top lip I want them to match well
we don't match lips because then it's
like two sausages so that's why I have
made Michaels bottom lip bigger than the
top because it's aesthetically more
pleasing to the eye
yeah that's generally honey mental yeah
it is yeah yeah you don't want to look
like you've got two sausages on your
face um so if anyone who is interested
in booking in with you or booking in for
