that is not going on my channel hey guys
welcome back to my channel so today I'm
gonna be doing a snapchat Q&amp;amp;A I just put
my son shot in public if you don't have
me on snapchat I'll leave it down below
and on the screen right now cuz God had
me it's so much fun I post the craziest
 on their shoot with my mom and it's
really really fun so basically a
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A is where I asked you guys
to send me video questions and I answer
them live on camera right here so
without any further ado let's get
opening all of your snapchats I'm really
excited I can't wait to see what you
guys have to ask that is so cute she
said why you don't got to have amazing
um ah no I'm not but thanks
oh my god I'm literally getting photos
and charts to you guys video only come
on I love you too my thoughts on the new
Beyonce album look to be honest I don't
know because I haven't listened
to it so see later to that everyone's
been asking me have you like watch the
lemonade video clip or whatever it's
called guys like an hour and a half I
don't have time for that I've got to do
other but I have heard a few songs
from it just like little snippets and
stuff and it sounds pretty good it's
very Beyonce it's very different
Ronnie haha what say figoratti you happy
darlin great love you too
my favorite induct on my youtube channel
probably have to be my club and get
ready with me they're not like the most
pinpointed affected makeup looks that
I've done or at all but there was so
much fun to film because like I was
drinking a little bit I was little
friend with me it's not my always
talking to her and they're like two
of the most popular videos on my channel
I believe so my cup and get ready with
me videos are really really fun
cool wedding coming to person youtuber
oh that's cute thank you so much I lost
your name here in my snapchat list what
am i coming to Perth I have no
intentions of going to Perth
unfortunately like I just I don't see
Perth is like a thing that I would go to
but if you ever come to like Melbourne
or anyway like that you might see me
there everyone like knows me where I
live like I hope not everyone but like
people just like I used to it now
you guys get those on tours to come
through them a little like uh and just
like you've really dirty looks but girl
water off a duck's back water off a
duck's back story time stream thank you
thanks I'm glad you enjoyed my story
time videos I will definitely be doing
another one soon I've got something
really good in mind that happened the
other day that I might be doing debating
whether I should draw it or not but I
think I'm just gonna do it anyway now
that you said that my favorite makeup
product will probably have to be
foundation because it can cover all the
imperfections on my face and I can just
take it on and it's it's it's they're
all gone they go on oh you're cute love
you too
ah my favorite ever lip product would
probably have to be the jeffree star
cosmetics velour liquid lipsticks and
toss up between the colour-pop lipsticks
as well I'm wearing this now this is
clueless by color pop I just
rediscovered this color I've had it for
so long and I don't think I've ever
really wanted and I am obsessed
did I go to makeup school or was I
self-taught I'm a hundred and twenty
thousand percent self-taught so
basically all I did was watch youtube
videos with the photos practice and yeah
practice makes not perfect because I'm
not perfect but I'm practice really does
improve how the whole makeup situation
and to be honest I believe going to
makeup schools they all do with their
different ways and you learn at the
teachers way so if you want to learn
yourself don't go to makeup school
number one save money number two you can
do your own way number three you can you
don't have to listen to anybody else you
just saw your own way if you don't enjoy
school just leave no I'm kidding don't
leave school just stay in school I mean
I was in year 11 drop out I literally
quit school the day after I turned 18
just wasn't for me and I just focused on
makeup I'm not going to need to know
those stupid math sums that's like
what's 4 / 7 the square root of 69 like
who gives a I'm not interested in
that
no I don't really get um my dad's
kind of like getting used to it now and
it's like I went out there with makeup
the other day and I was like he didn't
say anything or give me any tips and I
was like ah bums truly loves her used to
work she loves her never got really any
 for a month at all it was kind of
weird when I first started like that's
just any parent though but now they've
had least wetback lovey - the worst
comment that I've ever got was probably
one that was like I don't really recall
how it went but was something along the
lines of if that was my son I probably
would have aborted him or shot him dead
or something like that I was really
horrible
I just want to know what's your favorite
TV show my favorite movie at the moment
is bad neighbors to sort of the other
day awesome favorite TV show
that's just ended at this moment is the
Real Housewives of Melbourne I'm so debo
that it's finished because I love it but
the reunion is on the 14th sorry
15th of May gonna be so good for 90
minutes special get on twit what is your
biggest fear and by the way I love you
so much you made my confidence got so
much I love you my boy when
people say that makes me feel so good if
I can make anyone feel better in
themselves or like build their
confidence up that is the best feeling
that's what I want to drive I make
people happy I want to like build
people's confidence I want to help
people that's what I want to do and
hearing that makes me feel awesome and I
literally do not remember your question
now because that sidetracked me and so I
just want to know how you handle it cuz
it's really hard for me oh my god you
say he's been kicked out of his house
for wearing makeup I can't I can't
Oh what the oh my god parents are
just some parents I just I
mean I didn't give a what you
really just believes on you daren't
 you always love your child
unconditionally no matter what you don't
keep them out of the house if they're
come out as gay or transgender anything
like that that's just up that's
 made me so angry
oh oh two of my favorite things
that's a bitchy question girl you got me
 up to be honest I love my lips so
I could probably not wear lipstick again
so I'd have to choose off the
false eyelashes
it's yeah I was just wondering favorite
lip column Geoffrey smiles cause she was
sorry what okay babe
neither do I my favorite lip color from
Geoffrey's collection is definitely
celebrity skin and I just ordered Gemini
and I should be getting it tomorrow I
feel like I'm gonna love that color I
also feel like I'm gonna let doll part
and then drogyny Oh anyway guys that is
all I have time for for today's snapchat
