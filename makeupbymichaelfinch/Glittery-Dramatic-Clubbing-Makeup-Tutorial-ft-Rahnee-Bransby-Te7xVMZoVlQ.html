today I've got another client makeup
tutorial let's just get straight into it
first I just used the Afra primer and a
little bit of fix+
to hydrate the skin now moving on to
foundation I'm using the Urban Decay new
foundation but I start learning to talk
to go fast just to Kentucky phases and
I'm generously applying that this
foundation is so full coverage I'm so
impressed with this I need to get my
hands on a pale colors when I'm not tan
and a colorful when I'm tan because it
is so good so high coverage and yeah in
my opinion it's not that I think it
retails for $65 I'm not sure this was my
friends but I'm basically just putting
that all over her face and down her jaw
line now this foundation does oxidize a
little bit well actually a lot which is
a good thing in this case because as you
can see it's a little bit too like light
for her skin so it kind of goes to her
neck color as the video progresses if
that makes sense
kind of like the my joke was one house
that kind of um what's it called I just
said the word but I forget what it was
anyway I'm just taking a damp Beauty
Blender and blending that into her skin
I did put a little bit more fix+ on
there just to help the blending process
a little bit more moving on she
concealed that this is the Mac Pro
Longwear concealer in NC 15
I'm applying that on her forehead her
nose bridge Cupid's bow and her chin and
straight underneath her eyes just to
highlight the face and I love to use a
lot of concealer and Ronnie was very
shocked when she realized how much I was
putting on and I was doing under her
eyes and she didn't realize that I
wasn't joking when I said I'm putting
more on so she had a bit of a shock
because concealer is just one of my
favorite things in the world it just
covers so much and just stuff you don't
want to see so you look it actually so
shocked like she normally uses a little
bit and I've just gone absolutely Han
but that's not a problem
moving on to blending out I'm just
taking my jam beauty blender and I'm
going straight in with that down the
sides of the nose the nose I'm put also
putting that on the eyelids which I will
be setting straight afterwards to
prevent creasing
and I'm just getting all the way up in
there blending out all that concealer
I'm making sure it's completely seamless
so you can tell where the concealer
starts and finishes
I'm now taking the Cody Asche lime
powder this is in the shade translucent
extra coverage and I'm just making sure
that's all blended out underneath her
eyes first before I go straight in with
the translucent powder just so we're not
actually setting any creases and we are
preventing them with this powder so I'm
just generally packing that on
underneath to her eyes very generously
just because we're doing that we are
doing the eye second I'm just changing
it up a little bit for this video and
I'm also setting her eyelids just so
there's no creases and there's bendy
coming you do always have to make an
appearance now we're just taking the
Australia's fresh and flawless in the
shade medium tan to set the rest of her
foundation so it sets it nicely and I'm
also just going around the edges of that
translucent powder that I used before
just to mix that into everything so it
does help set the foundation I'm just
taking a little bit more of that
translucent powder and whatever it was
down the side of her nose just to set
everything in place now moving on to
eyes I'm taking the under starseer
modern renaissance palette I'm just
going in with the shade either Sienna or
burnt orange I don't know I just showed
you guys blood I remember and I'm just
dragging that through her clothes and
I'm basically just blending that all
through my crease and just slowly
packing on color and then it's taking
the shade realgar which is this orange e
really nice warm orange sort of color
and just packing that in for a crease
basically it's pretty self-explanatory
what I'm doing I'm just taking all
different colors blending it out packing
it on and then blending it out packing
it on basically all I'm doing I'm just
taking a bit of these true red colours
and a bit of the dark brown they're kind
of all over the place this eyeshadow but
it looks good in the ends so don't
stress and I'm just blending that out
perfectly well not perfectly I'm just
blending it out until it looks good and
then I drew go back in with a bit of
translucent transition the my oh my god
I keep forgetting everything today
what's going on with me sorry guys I'm
like a little bit sick once again
because I'm always bloody sick and I
should be changing my diet because
that's probably why my eyes sit anyway
moving on to glitter this is the violet
Voss glitter in copper Ella I'm taking a
little bit of that with the Too Faced
glitter glue I'm just applying most of
the glue where I work most the pigment
and then when I wanted to kind of blend
out I'm just kind of patting the brush
not taking any more glue and just
patting me
XS around so I'm going straight in with
back litter and oh my gosh look at that
look how good it looks
I love glitter so much it's so I don't
know I just I'm obsessed with glitter
it's so pretty
so I'm just packing that on both of her
eyelids and making it look completely
stunning I love it and then I'm just
blending around the edges the glitter a
little bit just to make sure there's no
harsh line of glitter if you're a makeup
artist you know what I mean by that
harsh line it's not a harsh line but you
know what I'm talking about
or if you just use makeup and glitter in
general you don't have to be a makeup I
don't know anyway I'm just taking a
little brush and just dusting off all
that fake and the fallout that we used
now for her eyeliner I'm using the
English eyeliner in 77 just to create a
nice wing I'm just getting her to look
straight ahead for me so I'm joining up
that wing from her bottom lower lash
line and then getting her to close and
then just going straight in for it and
doing that wing so I'm just joining that
up across her top lash line just to
create a nice shaped wing just so the
lashes can dissolve into something a
little bit easier then I am just working
on underneath the eye so I just put on a
little bit more translucent powder just
so the fall out I think we've just wipe
away super easy so I'm just doing what I
did you guys know how this goes is where
I always do same procedure on the top
same on the bottom so the transition
color that I used that was what I was
looking for before and then realgar a
bit of Cyprus on bar just taping taping
anything really well just changing up my
brushes as I go and explaining
everything out so it's nice and smoky we
were going to do black in the waterline
but we decided not to because we didn't
want to close the eye up too much but
I'm just dusting away that extra
translucent powder that I put there
before moving on to bronzer this is the
money bait money
really this is cliff Milani baked
bronzer and I'm just using that one a
big-ass fluffy brush just to bronze up
the face for Jolla and the forehead and
a little bit on the nose as well just to
bring everything together now to
actually contour i'm just using the UH
Nastasia Beverly Hills contour kit and
I'm just contouring her cheekbones her
forehead and her jaw line and a little
bit more in her nose so you guys live
you guys know I love to go ham on the
contour which is exactly what I'm doing
I'm kinda bringing it down into a cheeks
a little bit magical if I still act it
looks better when you bring the contour
down onto the cheeks just cleaning it up
with some translucent powder that I used
before so I'm just baking that cheekbone
area and also down the sides of her nose
now I'm just taking a bit of the Ofra
banana powder just to brighten up the
under-eye area a little bit more and
just to cover up that bit of a white
cast that the translucent powder is left
not that there's flashback in it but it
just does leave a bit of a white cast
which is like with every term Susan
powder now for highlighter we're using
the anastacio moonchild glork it wasn't
too impressed with this one I feel like
it wasn't very pigmented and the colors
weren't all that great but it's good to
use something different and moving on to
her brows I'm just brushing them out
with a little spoolie brush and just
going in with the benefit browsing brow
kit and picture was in the number-three
just creating a nice brow shape using
her natural brow shape and then just
going with a little bit of gimme brow
from benefit just to tint the blond
hairs and really get all the foundation
and stuff that was in there out before
moving on to the sky this is the Too
Faced better than sex mascara and I'm
just using that on her lashes and going
straight over the top of that these are
the really lashes and the style Mykonos
Davis stunning I have a discount code
for them but I'll leave it down below
I'm just using the House of lashes lash
glue and sticking that straight onto her
eyelash and I had a bit of trouble
getting it on my inner how it just goes
everywhere sometimes and then you get it
and then it's all good like you're
freaked out for a second but then it's
all good especially when you're using
black lash glue it's scary
so yeah that's nice and on then we're
just doing some bottom lashes this is a
Mac extended play gigablack lash mascara
I'm I know we're not using disposable
mascara wands but we're friends that we
don't really care so yeah that's the
plan the gist is popping that on and
blending in full together making it look
pretty now for lips this is their Mac
lip liner in either spice or well I use
it in my last client tutorial as well
because I like this color it's pretty so
I'm just letting her lips with that and
then we're going in with the Charlotte
Tilbury lipstick in the shade Beach
perfect I think it was and then we went
over with a little bit of Cali lip gloss
in literally and
they're just using the other star
Beverly Hills oh my god I do this every
time we are using the Oprah highlighter
in the name Beverly Hills and then just
getting her face with some sale day by
drug cosmetics and that's pretty much it
I hope you guys enjoyed this client
tutorial if you did don't forget to give
me a thumbs up I love you guys so so so
much and I will see you all in my next
video bye so you who Mindy honey now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
