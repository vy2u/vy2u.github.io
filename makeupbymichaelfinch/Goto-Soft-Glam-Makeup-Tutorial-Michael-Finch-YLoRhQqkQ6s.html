let's just get straight into it so I'm
first priming my eyes with the heart
shape tape concealer love this concealer
so much if you guys have been watching
my channel for a while now you will know
how much I love this it is so good
so I'm just blending that out with the
real techniques sponge making sure there
are no patches or anything at masking it
like that now moving on to eye shadow
today we're going to be using makeup
geek eyeshadows I will be leaving them
all down below in the description in the
order that I use them in I know this one
is Peach Smoothie and a little bit of
either frappe or latte and I'm just
putting that throughout the crease and
starting to pack on color now moving
into a darker shade I'm just adding more
definition around the outer V I'm trying
to keep this sorry blended and looking
so so so smooth because I wanted to look
really just like blended so I'm just
blending all of that now going back in
with two different brushes that I'm
using and then I'm going on with like a
darker burgundy color
I'll also be leaving it down below
obviously and starting to define that
out of it a little bit more just look
involves a lot of blending and going
backwards and forwards I was doing a lot
of makeup looks but this one especially
does involve packing on color and then
going back in and then blending and blah
blah blah anyway so I'm just doing that
and bringing that through my crease a
little bit three more greens just
because I do have hooded eyes
yeah I'm just blending that out making
sure their inner gosh warns us all oh
we're going back in alright now we are
taking some of the black from the
shooter Beauty palette because I feel
like this black eyeshadow blends out so
seamlessly so I'm just packing that on
blending it through my crease and yes
hanging on the color until it's all
blended out just so there's a little bit
more definition on that out of the
- extension way to the eye now moving on
to the lid I'm just going to be taking
the Tarte concealer again and kind of
creating like a low-key cut crease like
it's not all the way across the lid it's
just on the inner corner so I'm just
taking that concealed and popping that
all across my eyelid and making it look
as perfect as I can I guess it's really
hard to do this especially if you're
like a beginner I still struggle with
this and it scares me a lot but practice
makes perfect
don't we all know that so and then just
packing on peach smoothie over that and
I didn't like that so I drew going with
a another color afterwards but I'm just
taking whatever is left on that brush
and just blending the outside here you
can see I'm just going in with some
eyeshadow from makeup geek
I'll be leaving it down below by
slipping it down below it will be down
below I promise they're just taking a
glitter from glitter injections the
shader that will also be left down below
also because I'm so great and
remembering colors as we all know so I
was packing that over the lid and then
I'm taking the Urban Decay glitter liner
and just popping that in the areas shown
now moving on to the wing I'm using the
Inglot gel liner and surprisingly enough
my wing will go on camera
for the first time in a long
time so I'm just drawing up my thing
with a little angled brush and oh there
I go out of frame
are you surprised though are you shocked
and that's what it looks like oh there
we go out of frame again okay now we are
moving on to my mascara this is the Too
Faced better than sex even is that
facial I'm pulling like what even I you
like what I don't anyway moving on to
lashes I'm using the shooter Beauty Jade
at number thirteen and I'm just seeing
if they look okay you know it's popping
that on yep and I'm pretty happy with
that
so just saucing that out see if I like
it yeah looks pretty good to me so I'm
just applying some House of lashes clear
lash glue because I don't know where my
black one was and then I'm just sticking
that straight on and adjusting it making
sure it's stuck on that last band
it's not going to stick up at all and
outer frame at all again now moving on
through the face we're using the mac
fix+
to hydrate and moist and up my skin
slightly and for primer we are using the
backup backlight primer
guys this looks so cool look I like
glowy and luminous it makes my skin look
I really like to it just looks cool and
I feel like this gives you a really good
base for your foundation because it's
quite gooey
maybe it's just me I don't know for
foundation we are pulling an extremely
weird face and plumping my lips up and
using the hourglass vanish foundation
stick and writing hey on my floor head
because I am such a loser and I'm just a
loser now this foundation is very very
yellow compared to my neck but I do
blend it down and make it all work
although people ask why do I use yellow
foundation because it counteracts the
pink tones in my opinion and I just like
having yellow face so if people want to
like have a go at me and say sir motions
to yellow like go to Sephora and color
match will eat my asshole because I'm
not going to because I'm happy with the
way this looks so I'm just planning that
out was made more feet g36 brush this
brush is so good to blend out a stick
foundation it's also really good to use
with what am i doing see my hand got
sore so I did swap and it doesn't even
work like what even are you what are you
doing I'm just concealing the tops of my
brows also with that foundation so it
matches my forehead just with a little
skin thetic brush to conceal them you
know and just blending that out once
again moving on to concealer now this
concealer was a fuckup because I put
three things on it ended up coming off
which I'll show you guys in a second I'm
just using a little bit of the Urban
Decay Naked skin just all over the
t-zone and underneath my eyes and it
wasn't enough or is a little bit too
dark so I do go in with some Mac prep
and prime to try and brighten it up a
little bit and then I go to blend it out
and the sponge or I don't
know if it was the product or the sponge
I don't know what it was but it took
half the off so I did put a little
bit of tape shape over the top of that
just to brighten it more because you
guys know I love a you know bright under
a highlight but looking in my nose okay
it took all the concealer off or I don't
know what it was so I just caked on
heart-shaped X and that fixed my problem
so if you ever have a problem like that
just take your highest coverage
concealer pack it on and blend it the
 out and I can guarantee your
problem will be fixed look how much I'm
applying like I don't even care I love
concealer it's absolutely stunning I
love a white bright under-eye highlight
I feel like I can never be too bright
ever well maybe sometimes no not really
so I'm just blending that all open my
nose and then I do take a I really need
a cloth but I don't want to stop the
voiceover because I hate doing that I'm
just taking the airspun powder and I'm
just packing a little bit of that
underneath my eyes just to bake and set
those three layers of concealer and then
to set the rest of my foundation I'm
just taking the astronomers brush
applause from darkest Brown you guys
know the drill I always use that you
have probably getting sick of it I'll
get some more powder foundations to
change it up a little bit soon now I'm
moving on to me moving on to me okay not
a problem
underneath my eyes I'm doing exactly
what I've done the top just under me
just with the brown just blending it out
with a flat shader brush and smoking
that down a little bit then I could go
in with a little bit of black from a few
de Beauty palette also and just blending
that underneath my eyes to make it look
a little bit more defined you know now
moving on to bronze are you guys you
guys this is my new favorite bronze I do
need to get my hands on this I was at my
friend's house I was using all of her
makeup sorry about it but I do need to
buy this ASAP it is the Marc Jacobs from
mega bronzer it is literally low-key Mac
and give me son
not as orange and it blends that up like
it's just amazing like look at this
go it is blending seamlessly you don't
even have to try you don't even have to
try and it blends it out and it's also
the best for nose contouring because
it's so smooth and just looks so blended
I'm obsessed
and this is a combo mixed with the hoola
from benefit me up the ass
it is literally stunning absolutely
stunning yeah I am contouring with a
this brush I don't know I think it was
Nicki asked or Nicki contouring with
this or maybe it was makeup by Jack I'm
not sure but I saw one of them
contouring with a brush like this and it
works a treat it's like seeing
it's not too big and you can really get
in there and create a nice line without
it being too harsh okay moving on to
blush that with some Milani blush I'll
leave the shade down below doesn't
really show it very well on camera as
you can see donor way and then
underneath my eyes I'm stacking on some
Mac extended play gigablack lash because
it's perfect a lot of lashes and running
some benefit gimme brow through my brows
in case I got any powder in there which
I did hence why I'm using it like I
smell like a radio show okay so we're
just putting that through my brows now
moving on to the Natasha Genoa all-over
face glow wasn't impressed with this so
I just wasn't showing that very well
like it wasn't very good in my opinion
so I changed over and I changed to Becca
moonstone and just put that all over and
I was so happy with that look at the
happiness in my face and I just pack
that all over my face inner corners
you know what everything and now moving
on to lips this is colourpop's she I
have not used this in a hot minute I was
obsessed with this liquid lipstick
months ago and I picked it up again and
cut off there we go so I'm just popping
that on and then also I'm putting some
Urban Decay setting spray on and then I
thought that was enough so I went in
with some color pot gloss in the shade
Weehoo and that is the finished look
so this is the finished look I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
did please don't forget to give it a
massive thumbs up I love you guys so
much and I will see you all in my next
