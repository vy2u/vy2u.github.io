channel so I've wanted to do this video
for so long and I've just never done it
don't know why but it's super highly
requested so yeah so today I'm just
going to show you guys how I remove my
makeup and kind of just my quick
skincare routine I'm not gonna be like
getting the camera and putting it in the
bathroom and like doing all those shots
I'm just gonna sit down and show you
guys how I do it and what I use this
video is not sponsored by the way a lot
of skincare videos that I see ah not
that that's a bad thing I'm just putting
it out there that none of this is
sponsored I literally love all this
and I use it every single day all the
time without any further ado let's get
straight into it
so my skin over the years has been kind
of like an acne bone um when I wear
makeup all the time I do break out a
little bit no matter what makeup
products I use but to remove my makeup I
usually use the oh my god
Lily's gonna kill me but I literally
just found a packet of the Neutrogena
makeup wipes that she bought at
Priceline the other day and I'm gonna
use them because she's all mine this is
incredible
okay so the makeup wipes that I always
use but I've run out of sorts been using
these Johnson's face care wipes um is
the Neutrogena either the night coming
all the day one's the day ones are in a
blue packet I have been using these for
years they are quite expensive they're
eight dollars for a pack of 20 I don't
know 25 cake dollars so that's like I
don't know 50 cents each no bit less I
don't know anyway I'm not good at math
so let's move on so to take makeup off
these are the absolute best days makeup
laughs - the absolute best so what I do
is I literally just go in and just start
taking off all my makeup I always start
with my face I don't know why lipstick
needs to remove itself so I always
always always use a makeup wipe first
take off my makeup and then I cleanse my
skin straight afterwards I'm trying to
go straight in and take off my eye
makeup actually one swipe and it's all
off and I kind of just like go into
circular motions around my brow to get
all of that brow I probably used to in
total makeup wipes I try and use less
because they are expensive and I just OH
rip off my lashes the hardest part of
taking my makeup off is probably if I do
black on my waterline it's always so
hard to get off because it just keeps up
hearing all throughout the day or the
night or whenever I take the makeup off
I'm looking oh man don't mind it though
please take your makeup off so well like
literally perfectly sir my skin's
looking pretty clear no I'm just gonna
wipe off ah oh my god I can't believe
I'm doing this is like a tutorial that
now I'm wiping off my eyes like it's
 obvious what you're wiping
dickhead like we now move on so I just
try and get off as much
possible of the the black eyeliner so
I'd never put luck in my waterline
because it's just annoying to take off
and I have to go Christmas shopping
after this but and then I just get my
finger oh and I go right up on in here I
just hate having like black eyeliner in
my waterline when I have no makeup on it
just makes me look like I did in 2002
okay so now that my makeup is all off my
skin is looking pristine but it does not
stop there
so what I like to do next I just pull
this out of my shower hence why it's so
dirty but this is the Tata indigo
soothing rice enzyme powder it's kind of
like an exfoliant and I use this every
single day almost every single day
sometimes I don't if I don't wear makeup
to like my natural oils and my skin to
come back so I just like to pour a
little bit of this into my hand and at
this point I'm in the shower so I've got
like a little pot of water here take it
exfoliate a little bit this just gets
out all the extra bits of makeup that
have been missed and it makes you feel
your skin feel really good as well I'm
just gonna go and rinse all this
exfoliant off that's all I do I don't do
too much I'm gonna go rinse it off and
I'll be right back okay so next what I
like to do it's just add a ton of
moisturizers and whatnot so the first
thing I like to put down is the lamellar
and you'll boil so I just like to put a
little tiny bit of this not on my t-zone
cuz that's where I get oily and I feel I
could just I don't know but I like to
put a like around the perimeter of my
face and especially areas where I get
dry like I don't know my lip on my top
lip that's probably and getting dry but
I trying to avoid like the nose area and
what I like to juice is whatever is left
on my hands I'll just put underneath my
eyes cuz oil for your under-eye creases
or wrinkles or lines or whatever are
really good and moisturizing and I like
to keep them nice and moisturize and
also the outer corners of my eyes they
tend to get really red and sometimes
they get a little bit dry and so just
because it's really sensitive and I'm
wiping makeup on putting makeup off
don't even make sense I don't know and
then I like to go in with a little bit
of the ASI skincare pure hydration
concentrate then what I like to do next
is take a bit of the ASI skincare pure
hydration concentrate and I'll just take
like that much on my hand you're not
meant to use much but I always break the
rules and use a fuckload so and I just
put this all over my face and this
really moisturizers and just like
rejuvenates the skin and I've had like
long days of wearing makeup lately so
this is like perfect my skin's gonna
love me and when you wake up in the
morning your skin just looks like
flawless and my super moisturized and
happy so I put that all over it and then
if I want a really deep cleanse
moisturizer I'll take some of the lmm
moisturizing cream almost out of this
it's like you can't really say but it's
almost gone this is super thick and hard
to move around your face but after like
5 or 10 minutes your face looks so oily
cuz this is like working and it's like
sinking into your skin so I do need a
bit of a harsh moisturizer right now so
I like to just take a little bit of this
and pop this on this over it like if you
have dry skin this would be perfect for
you and my skin's like oily sort of dry
it depends on the weather to be honest
it always changes on the weather and I
just put it all down my neck next I like
to put every product through my brows
too cuz I'm I did actually get a pimple
in my browser day and it was very
painful so I like to keep them all nice
and cleansed and clean and get all the
makeup out of them and then the last
thing I like to do is I'll just take
some of the touch of water cream and
just put a little tiny bit of this on
over the top got a more moist out of
this I've been through like three of
these in the past like six months so
just a little bit of the water cream and
I'll just pop that over the top now my
skin is obviously looking super red
right now because I've just been rubbing
it with a million products but that'll
calm down in about five minutes yeah
this is pretty much all the skincare
that I use sorry this is the end of my
skincare removing my makeup routine
if you guys have been asking for it for
so long because you guys have seen a
massive improvement on my skin and I
gray I'm really loving it lately I've
just got a few little spots pimples and
stuff that I have to work on and I was
getting skin needling done at one point
that's where like they're like ten
needles going to you face at the same
time and it like goes deep and it draws
blood and that like I don't know what it
does to be honest but I'm gonna start
doing LED treatments very soon
so yeah my goal is to just have like
literally perfect skin and no freckles
no nothing like I literally once again
that looks like nikkietutorials because
she has the most perfect skin I hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you did make
sure you give it a massive thumbs up and
I'm really sorry it wasn't very
entertaining it was more informative I
just wanted to get it done before the
new year cuz I know you guys have been
asking for a quiet a lot I love you guys
