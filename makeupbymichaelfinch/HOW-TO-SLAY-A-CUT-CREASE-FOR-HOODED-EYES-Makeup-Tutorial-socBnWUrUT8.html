hey guys welcome back to my channel so
I'm just gonna get straight into it
things I don't have enough time for an
intro so I'm just taking some concealer
and is applying that to my eye as a base
this is the Maybelline fit me concealer
all products will be listed down below
by the way so I'm just making sure
everything is covered with that and then
I was taking a damp Beauty Blender and
letting that out this is the best way to
blend out your eyeshadow base in my
opinion when you're using a concealer
and so then I'm just setting that with
the Australis fresh and flawless pressed
powder in the shade deep natural this is
the right shade for me to set my eyes
with and I'm also going to be doing this
new thing where I leave all the brushes
that I use will be left on the screen
because a lot of people ask me what
brushes I'm using so there we go
hope you guys like that now I'm just
taking the modern renaissance palette
you don't have to use this palette you
can use any eyeshadows you want any
single Brown eyeshadows I just decided
to dip into this one to get the shade
burnt orange and I'm just taking the
little tiny liner brush that I like
using for my wings liner to kind of
create that new crease and I struggle
with this a lot this is very out of my
comfort zone but I just thought I'd try
something a little bit different now I'm
just taking a little pencil smudge sort
of brush and what I wanted to do
throughout this video is not cut part
out
I wanted to speed them up so you can see
the whole blending process because it
does take a while to blend and when
you're working in such a small area such
as a cut crease you have to be really
really careful and I think I went okay
with that whole that whole part I think
I went okay now I'm just going to take
it the color cocoa bear from makeup geek
and I'm just going to be deepening up
that crease so now I'm working on making
that line a little bit more defined and
also blending it out at the same time
now I'm just taking another brush I'm
switching up my brushes a lot in this
hence why there on the screen also
because well you need to change your
brushes up because you're working in
such a confined little area especially
when you have hooded eyes like me this
is directed for people with hooded eyes
although if you don't have one of those
you can still follow this tutorial but
yeah when you've got hooded eyes you
need to really make make that line a lot
higher then it normally would be for
people with you know regular circle I
don't know what it's called regular
circle eyes I guess I'm just taking the
shade I'm pretty sure this is frappe
from makeup geek and I'm just actually
it might not be frappe I'll leave it
down below my bad and I'm just deepening
up that crease a little a bit more just
adding depth into that outer part of the
crease now I'm just going over that with
a massive blending brush and it doesn't
matter if you go over the line a little
bit because we are gonna be cleaning
that up with concealer but I'm just
taking a highlight color and just
highlighting my brow bone now this part
is kind of unnecessary but I did want to
put in my mistakes is this what might
was like kind of my first time doing a
cut crease I didn't really need to do
this concealer part because the glitter
that I'm using next really did cover
that up anyway and it wasn't really
necessary I did use a glitter before on
this but I wasn't happy with it so I
changed to this glitter injections one
so that's why there's a bit of a
different color there but I'm just going
straight over that and you know I just
put that in because I make mistakes too
to do my wing I'm using the Maybelline
studio gel liner now this is really hard
to do when you've got glitter on because
the liner gets chunked up in the glitter
a lot of people do the glitter
afterwards but ain't nobody got time for
that like I don't have time for that
like I reckoned that would be so much
harder so I'm just dealing with it and
trying to make it look as good as
possible then I'm just taking a makeup
wipe and cleaning up that outer edge and
then I'm just popping on summer sky this
is the Too Faced better than dick
mascara love this the sky there's the
mascara phase a little tip um you can
use gel liner for this or mascara I'm
just going over my blonde lashes with
the mascara to you know get rid of all
the blond parts my lashes today are
Sophia as sapore I'll leave them down
below what style they are in I'm just
plopping them on and the lash glue I
used was the house of lashes black lash
glue that's my
the girl Ashley you know now moving on
to the face this is the mac fix+
I'm just putting that on just to
rejuvenate my skin a little bit and I'm
also going to be using the LA girl HD
Rama we're you know just rubbing that
into my big old face when you've got a
big face like me you need to put a lot
of primer on and a lot of foundation
like it can be it can be a it can it can
be a lengthy bit of a you know tutorial
when you've got a big face like me this
is the Make Up For Ever HD foundation
I'm obviously matching it to my tan but
it was a little bit darker than my tan
because my tan had worn off a bit and I
did not know that so I tried to make it
work and blend it out to my skin tone as
much as possible now this foundation is
I kind of sound like a radio station as
much as possible so this foundation is
rather orange I'd like to say I mean
it's kind of true but it's probably just
the shade but I'm making it work with
concealer this is the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer and nc15 my favorite I'm
almost out of that need to get more hmm
so I'm just highlighting my face with
that and I'm blending that out first
I'll be making that and then I'll be
doing my t-zone area afterwards
now to bake I'm just using the Husky ma
no color powder I really like this
powder someone commented on a video the
other week that state says that they
bought it and it gave them really bad
flashback I don't know why because I've
never had flashback from it just make
sure you knock this product off really
well with a brush at the end and there
shouldn't be any flashback I don't know
maybe it varies for different people I'm
not sure then I'm taking the Australis
fresh and flawless once again in the
shade medium ten to set the rest of my
foundation just on a big-ass fluffy
brush
moving on to underneath the eyes and
then just going back in with simple
orange and some Coco bear just whatever
was on that brush pretty much I'm just
going straight back in with it and then
I'm actually taking a little bit of
corrupt from makeup geek also and I'm
going to be darkening up that outer eye
shadow I did just do a little in a
corner with some eyeliner as well just
cuz I like that effect out likes leaks
your eyes is that the word sleep I don't
know I just made it up sleek I love it
so yeah I'm just darkening up that eye
shadow with corrupt and just making sure
it's all plan it out for my lashes my
bottom lashes today I'm using Mac
extended play gigablack lash this is
perfect for bottom lashes then I'm just
going to be knocking off all of that I
see ma no color powder and I will be
going over that with another powder to
make sure that there is no you know sort
of white cast left for my bronzer today
I'm just using the Mac it give me Sun on
this big brush that I did use to set my
face with the Australis fresh and
flawless before because it all blends in
together anyway so I'm just bronzing up
my chin my jawline my cheeks my forehead
etc and I'm kind of bringing it down
onto my cheeks a little bit cuz I like
it when bronzers on my actual cheek area
rather than just like the outer part of
my face to contour I'm using the zoeva
brush this is my favorite brush little
shoutout to this brush it's on the
screen right now check it out I'm just
using the other star Beverly Hills
contour kit I'm not contouring too much
today just a little bit just because I
didn't really want a strong contour cuz
I wanted to focus this on the eyes
pretty much now I'm just contouring my
nose but I do have a full tutorial on
that you can go back a few videos ago
and check it out now I'm just taking the
bow for our banana powder and putting
that over where I did bake I think this
does kick off majority of the work asked
as well this is why I do it and yeah so
that might help if you do find it has a
bit of flashback if you go over it with
another powder if my you know minimize
it a little bit it does for me anyway
then for highlighter I'm taking the
artist Cotulla in the shade double take
this is a diamond glow powder it is
awesome they're kind of hard to work
with so I did spray a little bit of fix+
on my face just to make my skin a little
bit more sticky so the highlighter did
stick a bit better to my face and stripe
a little bit more I'm just taking that
on my Cupid's bow etc and then for my
lips this is the LA splash
in the shade I don't know it'll be down
below and I'm just putting this all over
my lips I really like this formula this
is the first time using this and I
really I really do like it then just to
lighten that up I'm just going over with
jeffree star cosmetics liquid lipstick
and I'm nude and I'm gonna be blending
that out with just a shitty eyeshadow
brush that I don't want anymore you know
and yeah making it all work so that was
pretty much the last step and then I'm
all done I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial if you did give me a thumbs up
and if you learned something or a little
tip and trick today leave it down below
because I want to know what it is and if
you guys like the fact that I leave the
brush names on the screen also let me
know because I will be sure to keep
doing that anyway I'll see you guys in
my next video bye sir</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
