today's video is going to be more of an
educational one but I do wanna give you
guys a lot of information that you can
learn and take from this now I'm going
to be talking a little bit about affect
makeup at the beginning and then I'm
going to get into all the lipsticks that
I've got and all the and how to
help spot the it's kind of hard to
help spot them but there are a few
little things that you can you know you
can like tell from it if that makes any
sense
first of all fake makeup is
illegal it is illegal as there are
no rules there are no health and safety
regulations there are no nothing when it
comes to making fake makeup because it's
illegal majority of these factories I'm
pretty sure they're mostly in China but
there are ones all across the world
there are fakes for literally everything
nowadays like I'm talking as soon as
Carly Jenna's birthday collection came
out and thanks for eBay of the car
shadow palette there are effects of the
cream shadows there are fake Jeffery
stars they're a fake at Bondi they're a
fake anastacio everything they're even
fake huda beauty like even just
like not brands that are as big as like
Sephora brands like oh they're just
they're everywhere they're literally
everywhere la splash other girl dose of
colors everything there's bags for
everything and anyone can con you these
days and it's so hard to tell and
its associate because it can be so
dangerous so when you purchase fake
makeup you have no idea what ingredients
are in there you can say the ingredients
on the back but it could be completely
different as to what's in there it's not
always legitimate like what's on the
packaging and what's in the actual
product because they don't care that
you're health and safety
they don't care there's bacteria in the
formula of whatever product they're
making they don't care if there's fungus
in there they don't care they don't care
about your house and so gene I just care
about the money and getting away with
making the fake products so let's say
you're going to like Queen Victoria
Market which is in Melbourne or you just
go to a market and they're selling
eyeshadows and they've got all this
amazing makeup so so cheap and you think
oh my god that's so cheap that's what a
general person would think and a general
person who is an into makeup or they
don't look into it as much they would
not know that that is fake and so
 dangerous there's a market in my
town quite often and they always have
the stories like the Urban Decay the
NARS like everything and I make a status
every single year saying if you're dumb
enough to
that from the
market but I just like to send out a
warning like I just want to stand in
front of this stall and just be like
this is all fake like you can burn your
eyes like it's so bad for you the
ingredients are Fox like last year when
I'm to God I was like oh I didn't know
you know indicated lipglosses like oh no
idea like and he was like yeah yeah yeah
like he completely just said you know
who'd have had the glasses for quite a
while now they've got you know the Urban
Decay Naked seven and eight palette and
you know Kat Von D's got about seven
pallets that she's made all up I mean
okay so let's just get on to the fakes
and like I can talk to a little bit of
how spot the fake Oh like this okay
first we let's talk about Kylie
cosmetics now as I said before packaging
is so hard to tell anything because
they've got it's so on point lately and
it's so hard to tell so basically this
is the fake one and this is everyone
these completely different colors sorry
I don't actually have the exact same
packaging as this one but they are
different colors so it's gonna be a
little bit hard to do so this is meant
to be the shade Dolce K alright Dolce K
let me open this up for you so
this is the fake one remember sorry this
is the fake Kylie Jenner liquid lipstick
in the shade
what you will notice is that at the top
of the little thingamajig II just right
here when you open it it's squeaky and
it comes undone very very well it's got
like it's got like no real clicky and
then when you open it the applicator is
thin and worthless this is like with all
the liquid lipstick fake ones that I've
got you'll notice that the applicator is
ships like the doe foot applicator
normally is a bit bigger and the stick
is a lot longer so these are the
side-by-side fakes of Dolce K what the
actual guys so real versus fake as
you can tell huge difference that's
pretty obvious that the color is going
to be completely off like that but you
can't really tell like if you're buying
online like a by swapping sal website or
if they say it's legit but it's not like
it's very hard to tell before you
purchase it because in the packaging it
kinda does look similar in a way kind of
not really i don't know
if you want to make up fanatical
whatever you just as I said you wouldn't
know now let's talk about fake Jeffrey
stars and I was so astounded when I
found out that these were fake ones on
the market there is actually a website
called jeffree star cosmetics com do I
know you that is all fake that is all
fake liquid lipsticks only buy off their
official slides from their official
website in store like morphe or if
you're buying just other makeup in
general it'll be in like David Jones
just everything official don't believe
any other that you see okay now
these are both in the shade Gemini this
one here with the sticker on it is real
this one here is fake so that is going
to be a huge indicator so a lot of the
stickers on fake liquid lipstick are
always off they're always circle and
basic like this this is the real one
with this sticker here these are both of
them side by side this one here is the
real one and this one here is the fake
one so as I said it's very hard to tell
sometimes I'm just going to open up the
fake one and there's no clicky thing it
just loosely comes out it just kind of
like glides out like there's no control
really and first step is the applicator
is completely off applicator is
completely off and it smells it doesn't
smell like that or anything it actually
smells quite nice it smells like a just
a like a peachy sort of like apple sort
of color I don't know it smells good
okay and then you've got the real one so
this one has more control and it's
coming out and the doe foot applicator
is actually on a massive angle and it's
bigger and more fluffy and this actually
locks in okay the fake ones did not lock
in so this is fake
here and this is real so it's very hard
to tell the difference but I'm not going
to like this color is quite nice but
still don't put it on your lips you
don't know what is in it so these are
both the applicators side-by-side this
one right here on this side is fake and
this one is the real one as you can see
huge huge difference and also this whole
is a lot bigger than the real one so
that explains like the whole non locky
any sort of thing they tried here with
the little clips but it doesn't honestly
doesn't do anything okay guys the next
where I'm not going to be talking about
is dose of colors now I have these both
in the shade truffle okay so I'm just
going to do a little bit of a swatch
comparison
so we have real versus fake so as I said
it's very hard to tell like it is with
all these like the colors are quite on
point and it is very hard
first thing the applicator for the fake
one is small and very very short and
tacky ok guys so here is the real one on
this side just here and here is the fake
one so as you can see the lids are quite
different as well on the inside there
are just very minor things that these
companies have forgotten to tack on to
but it's probably gonna cost them more
money if they want to get it exactly
like that guys I could literally go on
and on and on about all these brands
that I have all's I can say about that
is the applicators are quite different
the packaging is literally on point like
almost everything besides the stickers
on the ends are the only kind of hard
way to tell but everything else is so on
point and it's so straight you can call
one last thing I'm just going to talk
about is colour pop okay so colour pop
does have fakes unfortunately I never
knew that they did okay so we have the
real one on this side here and we have
the fake one on this side and when I
actually receive this packaging the
mallet has this massive sticker on it
okay colour pop does not have these a
barcode stickers on them okay once again
just opening it it's so hard to
get open first of all generally color
pops are that hard to open just opening
it it's just very loosely being open and
once again the applicator is short tacky
and that doesn't smell all that great
and it doesn't click in properly like it
just kind of sits there like so that's
all I'm going to talk about about
spotting the fakes today but I just want
this video to come across as a message I
just want you guys to know that there
are fakes for everything out there and
if it's too good to be true than it
probably is too good to be true okay
there are literally faced for everything
I've got the bomb I've got next as I
said before I've got who to beauty this
is fake they will like all three dollars
on eBay and I'm not going to be linking
anything because I don't encourage you
guys to buy these if you want to Dutch
your own personal choice but if I was
you if I bought it after watching this
video Kat Von D has fakes as well la
girl Mac liquid lipstick also has a
sticker on it they
Anastasio Beverly Hills and Lime Crime
they're all the folks that I've got but
I guys I'm just saying they're a face
for everything and it is so disgusting
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed something
from this video I hope you learned
something usually I hope I educated a
few people on the fakes in the world and
if you guys enjoyed this video or you
think is going to be helpful to anyone
make sure to share this with them or
stir them link just as a warning to
people okay just as a warning I love you
guys
sorry so sorry so so much and I'll see
you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
