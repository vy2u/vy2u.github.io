channel so today I'm gonna be doing a
full review on the huda beauty desert
desert desert dusk palette now I let
Sanderson pay off so shoutout to huda
beauty for sending this along to me the
packaging of the pr package is
absolutely amazing like a look at this
so it ripens um let me show you you open
it up and this is what you get this is
the packaging on the palette itself I'm
assuming this is what will be available
in stores just this by itself this is
the packaging for the palette itself a
ma fun so these are all the colors
inside I'll show you guys a close-up is
what they all look like this one here
was actually a little bit broken when I
got the package but that's normal with
usps shipping these days they're a
little bit shit yeah I am the unde
excited to get into this palette because
as you guys know if you've been
following me for a while the other Huda
greedy palette the textured rose gold
eyeshadow palette is my favorite
eyeshadow palette in the literal world
so I'm so excited to dig into this one
and I only just found out that she's
actually discontinuing the rose gold
palette so disappointing so I'm gonna
have to stock up and get like probably
10 sorry yeah unless this is what I'm
gonna love more but I highly doubt it
because I love that other palette so
much so to begin I'm just gonna put on
my eyes with the top shape tape can see
Li and then I'm gonna set up with the
dermablend powder and then I'll come
back and we'll get stuck into that
eyeshadow I'm so excited okay guys let's
dig straight into this palette I'm so
excited so first I'm gonna take the
shade called
desert sand I'm just gonna start off by
popping does it sand through my crease
now this is super powdery already I'm
not saying it's a bad thing though I'm
just gonna bring this color all up
through my crease all the way to make
inner corner and make outer corner next
I'm gonna take the shape called blazing
I'm gonna pop that straight into my
outer corner and make crease I'm gonna
start building up that color so I'm just
gonna start building up a color as so
this orangey warm tone
I'm just gonna blend that out with a
little bit more of desert sand and that
all the way up there
now you're deep into the shade called
mbar and I'm gonna pack that onto my out
of thee and I'm gonna start bringing
that up through mic release so take a
little bit more of a blazing and I'm
just gonna blend out that color I've
just popped down now it's taking more of
an BA I'm just gonna pack more of that
on now I'm gonna be taking some of the
shade called saffron
and I'm just gonna be talking that in
just a deep and everything a little bit
now I'm gonna be taking a shade called
ru D I'm not really sure how to
pronounce that I'm just gonna pop that
onto my outer-v
up in there and also my inner corner and
then I'm just gonna take another little
blending brush and stop blending that
out
now to take a little bit more of saffron
and I'm just going to pop that directly
above so I lost a bit of that color
there now for my lid color today I'm
gonna be jumping into the shade called
Turkish Delight straight on my lid
I'm gonna try apply it with my finger
because the brush just doesn't work but
it's kind of like with our old palette
you have to apply these colors with your
finger kind of annoying but whatever now
I'm gonna take some of the shade called
Cosmo which is that a pressed glitter
almost you know what I also take some
glitter clear because this shit is not
gonna fucking stick I'm just gonna pop a
little bit of glitter glue over the top
and then I'm just gonna pop on cause
Meyer you say thoughts but uh maybe a
man she's clinically with this shade
okay that is super pretty I'm not gonna
lie
now for my inner corner I'm gonna be
taking the shade called Nefertiti
Nefertiti and I mean I want to put you
somewhere in a corner but is it gonna
take slightly what a kind of blended
into that other glitter there I just
want to get my fucking finger and just
jab it on my eye oh my god I hate how
you have to use your fingers it's so
annoying especially when you got
fuck-off nails on okay guys now I was
gonna do the other eye the same as this
side but I do want to give you the full
rundown at the palette so I'm gonna do
something different on this side with
different colors so first of all I'm
gonna go in with the shade called
oh she really let's just go in with
amethyst which is this beautiful purple
shade and I'm gonna see if I can do
something cool with this so I'm just
gonna pop it on made out of V
and I'm gonna bring that all the way up
through mic release all the way up here
alright so I'm just gonna start by
blending this all the way up here I'm
gonna take a small denser brush and
start packing on amethyst so I get more
pigment this purple isn't actually as
pigmented as I thought it was gonna be
it's kind of like blending away into
nothing and I hate to say that because I
really want to make this work now for my
lip color I didn't take the shade called
Twilight I hate how you have to use your
fingers it's so annoying
I've got fucking nails on bro what the
hell come on like can you guys see
what's happening here
what the fuck okay sir I'm actually
really disappointed in like I want to
like this palette but it's just nowhere
near as pigmented as the other one
at all like nowhere near as pigmented
like I thought this purple was gonna be
so intense and it's just like not fuck
and now that I've added the purple over
that other color and it's a wet color
it's gone patchy oh my god but that's
how pigmented it should be
that's how pigmented this should be see
here but it's not it literally just
blends away into nothing
oh my goodness
like I didn't even put like see here I
didn't even put this color this wet
color up here and it's just like not
sticking at all it's kind of doing what
the subculture palette did what the
fuck's going on like see I'm going to
put color on it it just blends over wow
what the fuck man
guys I'm also just gonna add this is
what the palette looks like each time I
dig into it it's extremely powdery like
look at the purple and I'm just dabbing
the brush on and all this pigments
coming off I really didn't want this to
happen literally her old palette is so
much better okay so I'm gonna leave it
at this for now I honestly wanted to
love this palette I don't know what's
happened but this side here has gone so
patchy with that purple and like this
purple put like who know beauty you
think like pigmented like pigmented
eyeshadow this purple eyeshadow is not
pigmented at all it only looks pigmented
here because of the wet color that I put
down it's stuck to it and it's not
taking to anything up here either
either I should have palette does not do
this what is going on and to be honest
this orange shade that I used through my
crease here and the shape called saffron
they kind of literally blend it into
nothing like can you see stuff I can
literally just see the orange color and
if I was to go over this with more
saffron it's just gonna stick to that
glitter glue that I put down and I could
just see what I mean like it just that
was my fault because of the good of glue
but like just an example like I fucked
this eyeshadow up already but like if I
was to pack saffron black up here and
then if I was to take some of blazing to
blend that out
it kind of just blends into nothing do
you say what I mean
like her old eyes shadow palette does
not do this why is it doing this what
the fuck I'm so fucked off dude I was so
excited for this palette this is not
this is not normal and like when you put
this shade on your lid like it's like so
can't even fucking see it to be honest
anyway guys I'm gonna leave the video at
this to be honest I am probably gonna
say no for this palette and that really
hurts me because the other palette was
so good and it still is so good like I
can I reach that palette every time I do
my makeup every time and this palette
just doesn't is the formula change like
what's going on I don't understand I do
not understand so I saw must ask me gee
like the desert dust palette by here to
beauty I would have to say no and that
really hurts me because I was so excited
to this palette as I said a million
times in this little video anyway guys
I'm gonna leave it at this I hope you
somewhat enjoyed this video I hope you
got some information yeah I love you
guys so much and I will see you all in
my next video bye see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
