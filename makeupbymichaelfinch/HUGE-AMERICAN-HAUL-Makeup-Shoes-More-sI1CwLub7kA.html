channel so today I'm gonna be doing a
huge fuck off American makeup shopping
haul I asked you guys on Instagram if
you wanted to see one and a majority of
you said yes so here it is and let's get
straight into it
okay guys I'm just gonna start off with
clothes and shoes that I bought first
and then I'm just gonna get into the
makeup there is a lot of makeup holy
shit
okay so my first purchase was these
Balenciaga
these are literally the most comfortable
shoes I think I've ever worn in my
actual life they kind of turn into a
sock at the front and I'm just literally
obsessed with them when I saw them on
the shelf on my car oh my god I need
them so they are literally my favorite
shoes I think I've ever bought in my
actual life
my next shoe purchase was these Saint
Laurent red high-tops
guys just take a look I don't know where
the flaps so big at the front though
like I don't really know what to do with
it just kind of sits there and just kind
of flaps along you know the front of
your leg but other than that I'm
literally obsessed I've wanted some red
high-tops for so long and soon as soon
as I walked in on Mac so like when I
walk into a shop like sometimes if I go
around like he's the different shops
I'll find nothing but then other days
are walking to a shop and I'll see
something and I'll just be like I need
it do you know what I mean like when I
know that I want something I'll just get
it so the next stop was musky no I found
a little more Skynyrd all Akshay wasn't
little is actually quite big a little
more skeino boutique and I bought these
slides and I've been wearing them
literally everywhere I go because
they're so comfortable and they're the
perfect size for me normally when I buy
slides they're either too big or too
small and they either choke my foot or
they just slide the fuck off my foot and
these ones stay the fuck on well so in
my Skinner I bought these track pants
and this actually glows in the little
fucking dark one and then I also bought
this t-shirt here it's a fave too I
don't know if you guys can see but there
it is and then another one of my
favorite purchases is these studio beats
wireless this is in collaboration with
Bowman they're like nude and they're
gold and they're so comfortable they're
like over there over the ear headphones
I think I'm talking really loud now
because they actually block out sound as
well my last ones that I had just went
on the ER and they got really painful if
you wear them for like for like mumbles
in like an hour or two but these go over
your whole ear and block out all the
sound and I love the whole design of
everything it's just fucking stunning
they're nude and they're gold to my
favorite
fuckin see you later and then I bought a
new pair of sunglasses these are also
from Saint Laurent and they are
literally like a fuckin plasmus plasma
screen TV as you guys like to call them
I am literally obsessed with them
they're so big and oversized and they
fit my face perfectly and you can still
kind of see my brows when I wear them
which is what I love they're really
dirty at the moment because I've been
wearing them every single day and yeah
ok so first stop in America was Sephora
and I picked up the cinema secrets a
brush cleaner I've heard this is one of
the best brush cleaners in the world
assist an alcoholic one so I'm so
excited to give this a go guys is
honestly so much I don't know if I can
go through everything I'm just gonna
kind of just like quickly go through
everything so I don't you know just
video isn't gone for like fucking an
hour the next thing I picked up was this
translucent powder from Maybelline in
the shade fair light it's just kind of
like a finishing finishing loose powder
I guess I can use it to bake or
something like that also picked up the
master fix setting perfecting a loose
powder I think you can get this in
Australia but I just picked it up when I
was there cuz why not so a lot of this
stuff is from all types of for our CVS
and Target okay and then I picked up
this essence pre nude highlighter I
haven't actually swatched this yet but
I'm going to the girl in Ulta said it
was really pigmented but it kind of just
looks like powder after swatching that
but I don't know it could look different
on the skin ha nas will find out oh yeah
okay the next thing I bought is these
two your wet and wild bronzers one is in
the shade bikini contest and one is in
the shade ticket to Brazil now I don't
know why I bought two I think I bought
one at this shop and one at this shop
and just forgot that I actually bought
this already so I have two of these now
which is fab oh I also picked up some
lashes these are the Adele double ups
and these are from a brand called bring
the salon home kiss slash Couture so
they're fake mink but they look really
cool I found these in I think like some
pharmacy or CVS and they were like six
dollars so super cheap probably around
nine dollars Australian I think next we
have some wedding world mascara and then
we have a mascara firm NYC I believe I
was going to pick up another one of
their liquid liners funny stories I was
in CVS and I was looking at the liquid
liner that I wanted because the other
one that I've got was almost run out and
there was a woman in
and she literally got the last fucking
one and I was like you know what
see ya just an excuse to try something
new out I also picked up this NYC
bronzer and this wet-and-wild blush here
I've got a lot of drug stop the
drugstore stuff because I'm actually
really obsessed with drugstore things at
the memory now these two I picked up in
Sephora this is the Clinique beyond
perfecting foundation and concealer
foundation and then I picked up another
Lancome T ni doll ultra ware and I
actually got a new shade of this this is
in the shade 215 buff which is
completely different from my other shade
but it's actually a new show that they
bought out and it's got like a pinky
under turn so I'm thinking it's gonna
suit my skin tone better hot ass well
found are also in Sephora I got this
bozhe I don't know how to say it but
it's the one that Jeffrey always uses he
always puts it on his snapchat so it's
like that black peel-off mask I just
thought I'd give it a whirl and then I
picked up the a glam glow glow set our
makeup setting spray also in Sephora I
got these Sephora makeup setting spray
this is from the Sephora brand I'm
really excited to try it some Sephora
brand things and then I picked up the
facade unicorn essence which is like
that really like hyped makeup saram
thing I don't know now I don't know if
this video is gonna be up before or
after I upload the video where I use
this palette but I picked up these
Sephora Pro palette and guys I don't
know just gonna be Apple before or after
but honestly this is the best fucking
eyeshadow palette I've ever used in my
life the black eyeshadow in here is
literally shitting on Anastasio Beverly
Hills and huda beauty combined if you
live in America or you can get your
hands on this 100% you need to get your
hands on it because I'm obsessed and I
should have bought them fucking all but
I didn't only got this one the shades in
here a perfect true they're just like
you know the typical like warm Browns
and stuff like that but there's a black
in there which changes everything
because a lot of good eyeshadow palettes
don't have a black in them I also picked
up this Physicians Formula bronze
Brewster palette so there's a bronzer a
contour and a highlighter in there like
a matte highlighter and then I picked up
the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
foundation powder everything's like
really mixed up I'm sorry sorry guys
okay sir
still in Sephora I got the Giorgio
Armani power fabric a long way I found
I've been wanting to try this too so
long because the luminous silk is one of
my Holy Grails so this has meant to be
more full coverage apparently so I'm
gonna give this a shot and it was so
cool when I was in there they have this
thing in America I don't think they do
it in Australia but they had this thing
that they put on your skin and it like
tells you what shade of foundation you
are or like where you're meant to be
like what shade you should swatch around
your skintone I guess it was so cool and
the chick in Sephora was so nice her
name was Kiki and she worked in the Time
Square CIFOR if you ever go in there and
kick his working she is the best I love
her okay I also picked up this
highlighter by Sephora this is in golden
hour I'm excited to give this a go I
also picked up the anastasia beverly
hills liquid glow highlight it in the
shade curler because when makeup by jar
did my makeup she used one of the liquid
glows and she put her over powder and it
didn't grab blotch you know shook to the
fucking core so I picked that up I don't
know if that was the shade she used on
me but give it a whirl that was the only
one that was fucking in stock there I
also picked up the Dior forever under
cover concealer this meant to be super
full coverage so I'm excited to try this
out because you guys know I love my
concealers and I also picked up a house
of lashes clear lash glue because they
sell this in the American stores which
is amazing very fucked up on that do
okay going back to the drugstore as we
like to call it I picked up some more of
the s-bahn curry powder and this was $12
I paid $30 $40 for this online so it was
$12 I got the last one that was there
fuck I didn't get translucent extra
coverage I only got translucent
translucent extra coverage isn't only
the shade that I go for and I just
realized that fuck anyway this one
like literally twelve dollars so I
picked up one of these I also got the
Maybelline chrome highlighter I guess
now here's some more things from wet and
wild I picked up the pressed powder
compacts foundation I guess this is I
think it's a powder foundation who knows
we'll find out the Wet n Wild mega glue
highlighter in the shade crown of my
canopy when world is sorry fucking she
like literally that highlighter was like
four dollars I picked up this gel bottom
gloss and she concealers from wet and
wild I got the light one this was the
lightest one they had this is in the
shade light ivory and then I got a dark
one to see if I can like kind of like
cream contour with it in a way I'm sorry
if you guys are getting bored but this
is what holes are all about
yes I also picked up two of the liquid
lip colors from Jordana just these two
nude colors the LA girl Pro conceal
green concealer I guess for color
correcting another NYC bronzer here and
then I got the wet and wild further
focused Foundation and fucking cane to
try this out this was six dollars and 19
cents USD so super fucking cheap
probably around nine dollars Australian
oh good now I have two primers here that
I picked up this is the L'Oreal True
Match liquid Gloria illuminator crime in
highlight so I came to try that out and
then the Milani prime light face primer
this is describing and pore minimizing
yes I also managed to get my hands on
the Milani
retouched and erase concealer this was
the last one in the store because it was
sold out literally everywhere so I'm
keen to try this out this is the L'Oreal
lush paradise the mascara the packaging
reminds me of the true face better than
dick and then the covergirl liquid
lipstick I did not know covergirl did
liquid lipsticks and this is in the
shade gel fall I also got the Revlon
Colorstay concealer I think you can buy
this in Australia but I just saw her
there and picked it up and then I've got
the NYC matte foundation now this was
like four dollars so I'm gonna put this
to the test in a video soon also in
Sephora I got this concealer this is a
bright bright future concealer by
Sephora oh and then Maybelline I found
these in the store these are the
Maybelline Color tattoo I chrome it
kinda reminds me of the still are
magnificent medals lack of the way it
applies so it's kind of like a glory the
girls on your eye
I don't know I'm keen to try that out
also in Sephora I picked up the nos
concealers is in the shade creme brulee
because I used to be obsessed with this
I used to always use it in the shade
Chantilly I think that's how you say it
but I changed to creme brulee because
generally was out and it's probably true
quite for me and I've been more
interesting turn colors rather than
having a beaming white highlight under
my eyes you know I also picked up the
Physicians Formula hash tag install
ready setting spray as well I got this
from Target I think it was and then I
put a few things in here from Ulta so in
Alta I picked up these Vegas nail ashes
in a style grande glamour now
did use these on tanah Merah when I did
her makeup a while ago and they look so
good on the ice or I'm keen to try these
on myself and see what they look like
and then these lashes also from Vegas
nay in the style Shining's
go and then another pair in the style
bronze beauty
so these look cool as well they look
super super long and fluffy I also
picked up two highlighters from makeup
revolution these two shades here haven't
really played with makeup revolution but
I'm pretty sure it's a london-based
drugstore makeup brand so my London
peeps if there's any of you out there
I'll be reviewing these in a video soon
I also picked up the L'Oreal True Match
super blendable and makeup foundation I
don't know how this is gonna go it's in
