my channel so understand get straight
into it cuz I don't have time for a
quick little intro but today we're going
to be doing a cut crease holiday glam
sort of thing so I'm just taking my
shape tape concealer from Tarte and for
eyeshadow today we're going to be using
the Kylie cosmetics bronze palette now
my opinion on this is I would prefer
makeup geek and I would prefer the huda
beauty palette over it it's not that
fabulous you know what I mean like it's
an okay eyes shadow palette the burgundy
palette has a much better formula in my
opinion I don't know if they changed it
I don't know why it's different but it
is this is a little I find it a little
bit chalky but that's just my opinion if
you like it then that's great so we're
just kind of carving out a crease will
not really cut creases I'm not my strong
point when it comes to makeup they give
me so much anxiety so basically what I'm
doing is just taking the darker shades
and trying to create a new crease before
we carve it out with concealer so I'm
just adding some depth and definition I
guess and just blending all the colors
together as I said I had no idea what I
was doing but yeah then we're just going
to take some concealer on this flat
synthetic brush and just kind of like
carve out a new crease line um
definitely it's probably the easiest way
to do it but as I said cut creases are
not my strong point so just taking some
glitter glue and this a golden peach
glitter I'm just going to be packing
that onto my eyelid to give it a nice
Christmas thing sort of holiday sort of
vibe now for my eyeliner I'm just using
some black gel liner and just creating a
massive wing and kind of joining it up
now what happened next
I was not ready I don't know why
happened I don't know how it did but I
just went straight in and just made this
black line and to be honest it looks
kind of cool I really kind of liked it
but a black gel liner was kind of hard
to blend out so I would probably
recommend using a gel liner that's a
little bit more smudgy appropriate
because this tends to dry quite quick so
I should have used the Maybelline gel
liner when it came to this but I didn't
you know we're always learning so I'm
just trying to blend that out with some
brown and black shadows from the bronze
palette and hope for the best and I
wasn't too impressed with the way it
looks but makeup is a learning curve
okay I'm still learning everyone is
still learning they're so much to make
up I just applied some mascara and some
eyelashes they are the Egyptian clean
Beauty lashes spritzing my face with a
bit of fix+ and some just things
going way too fast again on my god I'm
just using that Marc Jacobs remarkable
foundation to match my fake tan I love
this foundation it is so great the only
thing about it is you really need to
bake your whole face when you
use it because if you don't it will move
in my opinion and if you touch your face
it will transfer so I like to bake my
whole entire face so this foundation
stays on all day every day
this is really good for oily skin
because it is a matte foundation I
wouldn't recommend it if you've got dry
skin just my opinion now going back to
my Tarte shape tape concealer this is my
new favorite concealer you guys honestly
you will not see me use anything else
before you will otherwise it'll get
boring but why fix it if it's not broke
as nikkietutorials says but honestly
it's so good at such high coverage I
wish they came out with a shape tape
foundation because it would be
immaculate anyway I'm just putting that
over my nose my chin my Cupid's bow my
forehead and underneath my eyes and then
I'm just going to be blending that out
with my damp Beauty Blender straight
away before going in and baking the
absolute out of my under eyes with
the Cote s1 powder I'm skipping the ICMA
today just because I feel like this bun
I've always loved it and I just don't
like using it this powder is like really
really high coverage and like geek black
it's a very powdery powder but you can
fix that with a little bit of setting
spray it's in six plus it's just so good
I'm obsessed with it as you can see I'm
baking my whole entire face I'm not
baking just kind of baking anyway moving
on to underneath my eyes I'm just taking
that black gel liner in my waterline and
then I'll be smudging that down with the
brown shade and also some black from the
Kylie bronze palette just to give that
smoky effect underneath my eye
so I'm just blending that out going back
in little bit more black just to define
it a little bit more and now I'm just
dusting away my under-eye baked oh my
god it looks so good that concealer
hetalia does wonders now for my bronze
artist my favorite part this is the Mac
give me son I can't get past this bronze
eye it is so so so nice so good so
orange but not orange and it just blends
so seamlessly it's my all-time favorite
bronzer to this day now to contour by
the way I did just change shirt because
I thought this look would not go with
that show that I was wearing before did
it anyway I'm just contouring my face
away with Anastasio Beverly Hills
contour a kid I'm not really contouring
my nose today I'm just kind of running
it down the sides just to give it a bit
of a bronzed look because it kind of got
lost in the concealer as you nose does
when you do your under eye can feel if
you know what I'm talking about
just creating a jawline and I put way
too much banana powder on the banana
powder I'm using today is from the
Anastacio on tool kit I literally grab
my brush and went and you know way too
much went on but I made it work look
I've blended to that and I made it work
for my blush today I'm just going to be
using a Malabar by Mac I'm just putting
that onto my cheeks and kind of brushing
it backwards it's a nice little flush
color now for my highlighter this is
blissful from ephra guys my first
highlighters are the bomb calm now
literally so good if you don't have any
and get your hands on them this sword
would so pigmented I'm obsessed so I'm
basically just putting that all over my
entire face until I am glowing using my
honest a steel brush this is the best
highlighter brush that I have found to
this day just applying a little bit of
under eye on the bottom lash mascara
which was their Mac extended play and
then for my lips this is jeffree star
cosmetics Redrum this is the most
beautiful formula liquid lipstick one of
the most beautiful formula liquid
lipsticks I have ever tried and I'm
obsessed and I love this look I think it
worked out really really shot on
snapchat I think it works really well so
this is the finished look I'm just
setting my face with some Gerard
cosmetics foiled a setting spray and
that's it I hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you did don't forget to give me
a massive thumbs up I love you guys are
so much and I'll see you all in my next
video
