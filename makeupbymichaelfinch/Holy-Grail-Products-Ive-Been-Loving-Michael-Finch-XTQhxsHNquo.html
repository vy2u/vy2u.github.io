video sorry in today's video I'm gonna
be going through my monthly favourites
and excuse my voice I'm still a little
bit sick so don't mind me I have got
some really exciting favorites of the
month to show you guys and share with
you all so let's get straight into it so
let's kind of do the nod makeup related
things first I know I'm kind of boring
but let's just get it over and done with
it
my favorite moisturizer of the month is
this natural is Australia pulp or 95%
pure moisturizer I got sent a truckload
of this in the mail and it's one of
those moisturizers that doesn't linger
it's not oily it's a slice into your
skin straight away and it does its job
so I highly recommend this you can get
this up like chemists send like
supermarkets and stuff like that
I'm obsessed that I have so many
different sizes of this and I've got
like a little one a medium one and a big
one and this is my favorite the next
thing I want to talk about is this
product from kills this is their nightly
refining micro peel concentrate so this
goes on underneath your moisturizer and
then you lock moisturizer in over the
top to lock this product in this
basically just rejuvenate your entire
existence it's so so good
I've been trialing it for quite a while
now because that's what I do left before
I like finally if I like a product o
trial it for ages and then tell people
about it you know I mean I won't just be
like yeah I love this I used to want
some it's incredible not all
guys by the way there'll be a list of
everything that I'm talking about down
below with all the names and all that
sort of jazz guys let's just get
straight into the makeup because that's
what everyone's here for let's be real
so my favorite highlighter of the month
is oh this is the jeffree star cosmetics
highlighted in King Tut as you can see
I've used quite a lot of it already the
formula is so buttery and amazing like
it just is incredible like I love it so
much normally I used to hate like I've
literally got on now if you actually
hate highlighting my face but you know
how sometimes highlighter it's hard to
blend the edges of it if that makes any
sense if you like to pack it on like me
this blends so so well next thing I want
to talk about another favorite that I've
already used once but it's amazing this
is the beauty killer palette from
Jeffrey star there are ten shades inside
we've got a hot pink
let's and shimmery ones this is my
favorite one it's like a transition this
color here I'll swatch FYE is the
blackest of black ever a pigmented black
is so important to me and this is
perfect
this one here is also really quite nice
I seen so many different reviews about
this palette either you love it or you
hate it but I'm one of those people who
loves it and I said watch a freaking
hundred percent and if I didn't like his
palette I would say but I don't I love
it so next thing I wanna talk about is
my favorite eyelash brand of this month
now my favorite eyelash brand is called
billion lashes so this is what they look
like a lot true here I want in the style
of alia and Cassie and my favorite style
is Gigi Kendall and Chloe I think it's
called but they're basically just like
mink looking lashes I don't think that
actual real mink but yeah other than
that they are stunning I love them I
whether I'm wearing them now I'm pretty
sure these are the style Gigi I wear
them in like all my photos because I'm
literally obsessed with them another
pair of lashes that I've been loving not
for myself but for my clients cuz I am a
freelance makeup artist so this is the
other pair so they're from model rack
model model rack different model Rock
and these are in the style demi wispies
and i bought it's from that pick-and-mix
range online you can get 50 pairs of
lashes by like ninety eight hundred
dollars so I bought 25 of them and 25
another pair that I'm not too keen on
but these are definitely great so if you
freelance makeup artists this is great
for clients they love them next I want
to talk about is the UH Nastasia Beverly
Hills of Modern Renaissance palette this
is incredible the colors are literally
mean I should have called this Michael
Finch because let me tell you about it
so this is what the palette looks like
and excuse me if it looks a little bit
dirty this part here is bounce which is
not all that great so it can get dirty
quite easily so I've been keeping it in
the box which I don't really want to do
but I kind of have to do because I don't
want to get it too dirty but are you
guys ready for this
come on how amazing are all these colors
like this one they're all like sort of
warm tones there's a lot of transitions
I think there's only four or five
shimmery shades and the rest of map this
one is obviously my favorite or the
orange one that one they're stunning
I love it so much they blend seamlessly
Anastasio shadows literally have never
ever ever let me down
favorite mascara of the month is the Too
Faced better than sex mascara I don't
think I've showed this in a favourites
because I haven't done one for so long
but this is literally so good I still
love my benefit they're real but this is
like kind of on the same level but this
it makes your lashes much chunkier but
not spidery looking sorry next thing I
wanted to talk about is my favorite
concealer I know you guys all know that
I love my NARS radiant creamy concealer
but I have moved on to the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer why because this is
less drying this is way less Drive it's
more moisturizing it doesn't settle into
like fine lines as quickly and this is
in the color fair neutral and this is
what I've been using on myself and I'm
obsessed with it I've got a few more
that I do use on clients because I'm
just about obsessed with it
and I'm running out of this so I need to
go and get more now let's just move on
to lip products so my two favorite lip
products of this month that I've been
using absolutely non-stop is colour-pop
chi this is a collaboration and color
pop clueless now I only just
rediscovered this and I love it so much
let me swatch them for you guys so the
top one here is Chi and the second one
here is called clueless now another lip
product that I have been unsuccessful in
this month I haven't won it that much
just because I'm getting so many new lip
products I like I want to try them all
out but this is called Gemini from
Jeffrey started kind of like a new
releases been around for a few weeks now
he's also just come out with another one
called mannequin and Rose mana mannequin
is like a cross between I'm nude and
celebrity skin and rosemary is kind of
like a pinky like toned down sort of
color I didn't buy them because she had
she had no money last week so this is
Gemini here I'll just swatch it on my
arm for you guys that's what it looks
like it looks completely different
depends like on the skin shine that you
have but it can look completely
different on every different skin tone
but like me I've got to show you guys
today is three liquid lipsticks from
earth for cosmetics so I've got Cocos
Island Panama and Laguna Beach let me
swatch them all for you so going from
the top down we have Cocos Islands look
during a beach and then Panama Panama is
like not really a car that I would wear
but it's really good to mix with other
lipsticks to make them like pop a little
bit more do you like a bit of an opera
in the middle guys that's all I have
I don't like rambling on about the
product to macho's I don't want the
video to go for too long because
favorites can be quite boring but at the
same time they can be quite interesting
so I hope you guys enjoyed it this video
and I'll see you all in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
