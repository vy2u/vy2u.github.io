sorry I'm in a bit of a different
situation today I'm currently sitting on
my couch in my new house which I'm
absolutely living breathing shitting
pissing fasting and gagging for I mean
please ignore what's going on under my
eye here I just had a bit of
Transportation is that a word it is now
sorry
today's story time video as you can tell
from the title is that time that my
Instagram got hacked now I don't know
how many of you have been following me
for that long but my sir Graham got
hacked I didn't even know when it was
because I don't even want to talk about
it and I don't even want to remember
when it was because it was so intense
and it was it was fucked now let's start
off this video by saying that it was
actually my fault but in saying that you
guys are gonna like understand why it
was my fault
and why it happened as I tell the story
okay so sorry to set the scene basically
my Instagram just disappeared one day
like it literally just disappeared and
it was gone
completely like it was just deleted and
gone and I was like how the fuck am I
ever going to get this back like it was
so hard
so I started by messaging Instagram and
like their little robot machine things
that like respond to you and like get
information and whatnot that never
actually worked and I wanted it back
pronto because Instagram at that time
was like my main source of income so I
literally had no job like it was just
it's scary working on social media
because it can be taken from me in an
instant you can always get it back but
like when it's gone it's fucking scary
my laptop is like overheating behind me
my brothers are playing right there guys
it's so exciting because in this new
house that I'm living in literally the
planes go right over the top of my
backyard and it's just the coolest thing
ever like I'm from the country I don't
see planes much if I do I see a
helicopter or a jet like really high up
but these planes are literally like so
low in my backyard and I'm just like
fuck yes bhindi so continuing on with my
story so I was messaging all these
different people on Instagram trying to
get it back and it just never ever ever
works like I just they just were saying
like you can't get it back and I was
like freaking out anyway so then at this
point I was like my Instagram is
literally and never ever ever coming
back
and I was devastated cause I'd works our
hearts like build my following on that
like with all my Instagram videos I'm
like my little clickbait Instagram cover
photos that I used to do back in the day
and I was just sorry disappointed
because like I'd built that and I'd put
so much effort into it do you not I mean
and it was completely just gone like
that so one of my friends her one of her
mates had this connection with Instagram
so basically um he said at the beginning
it wasn't gonna cost anything to get it
back he was happy to help out and just
help me get it back which was music to
my ears
all this shit went down and then
suddenly it was going to cost me seven
thousand dollars to get it back now this
was quite a while ago when I wasn't very
financially stable so seven grand to me
back then was quite hard it's still like
oh my god I'm just gonna come across the
store on Humble the way I'm trying to
explain this but like now I can like I
can do the seven grand a lot easier now
if that makes sense but this was a long
time ago sorry
7 grand to me back then was a lot it's
still a lot of money fuck I'm just gonna
get slammed to saying that but honestly
you guys know what I'm trying to say
right buddy if you keep eating that
plant we're gonna have a serious
situation come here come here quick come
here come say hello guys look how big
buddy is getting Oh buddy buddy Canole
buddy John oh you're such a good little
managee he's so adorable look at him Oh
buddy why do you have a wet willy are
you pissing everywhere again right so
the whole Instagram situation was I had
to pay 7,000 fucking dollars to get my
Instagram back and if I didn't pay this
then I wasn't gonna get it back so when
this was all going down I was in New
Zealand with Chris I'm pretty sure and
this happened over a period of lack a
month because there's so much more to it
anyway so I ended up paying the 7 grand
and getting my Instagram back ok
now number one I know for a fact that I
got no now bye number one I know for a
fact that I definitely got scammed that
literally cost it and no money to get
back it was just that the guy who was
doing it for me had a direct contact
to Instagram and just did a few emails
and made it out to be like really
dramatic and really expensive but so
yeah I got scammed $7000 that I'll never
get back and it just fucking pisses me
off to this day but whatever it's in the
past it's happened I got my Instagram
drunk you fuck rock the fuck on with
your cock out had enough anyway so after
that it happened
don't bite my pants after that had
happened I was like okay this can never
happen again I don't know I still don't
know why it happened apparently it was
for copy riot but I still don't believe
that for one second because I just
started believe it do you know what I
mean like I just don't believe anything
this guy said to me now because I didn't
want this to happen ever ever again
what I did was I have this friend in
Melbourne who's really big on social
media and he said that he could hook me
up with his manager in order to get
verified on Instagram now so there's the
jointing area apparently verification
doesn't add extra security to your
account it just makes you verify it
apparently it can make it a little bit
harder to get in but it's still in the
same level of easy to get into your
account if that makes sense
sir I was talking to this guy's manager
and he was like yeah no worries I can
you know get it sorted I can help you
get verified I was gonna need this this
this and this okay perfect okay so I
gave him all the information that he
needed and everything was perfect from
there on out now this is where I fucked
up so what happened was this guy said to
me
yep the verification process that
process or you should be verified by the
start of next week now I stayed at my
friend's house on a Sunday night and I
went home on Monday and I opened up my
computer and I saw my emails and there
was one from Instagram saying that I am
eligible for a bluetick verification I
was like perfect this must be it this
must be what all mates manager was
talking about let's do it so I got the
email and just I'm just letting you guys
know now it's you're like an influencer
or if you're on social media and if you
ever ever get an email from Instagram
saying that you're eligible for a
bluetick verification it is fake
Instagram does not send out emails to
get you verified
happens you'll just wake up and they'll
be a bluetick they're like it just
happens like you will never ever ever
ever ever get an email from Instagram
saying that so just a little heads up
I've actually helped a lot of people get
their instagrams back back that have
been hacked or deleted because I'm such
a pro I opened up my emails and there
was the one from Instagram so I put in
my phone number and my my friend number
in order to get a text message on my
phone that was connected to Instagram in
order for my verification ticket to
appear anyway so I got a text from
Instagram and I put the card in on my
computer and then I was like oh okay so
I'm like refreshing my Instagram and I'm
like oh am I gonna have the blue tick
yeah like how long is this gonna take
anyway I'm sitting here and I'm
literally just like refreshing
refreshing refreshing refreshing and
then I quickly got into my settings I
don't know why I did it but I went into
my settings right before I got logged
out and my email and my phone number had
gone and my my my email and my Instagram
had changed true like Jacob sutorius at
gmail.com like a fake email that
someone's made and then as soon as I saw
that email I was like fuck and then I
went to refresh it and then I was logged
out of my Instagram and I was like Fox
or I was hectically messaging this all
Mike's manager in Melbourne and he was
in a meeting into like two o'clock so it
was like six hours later I'm like please
tell me this is it place I mean this is
it and he got back to me hours later by
then it was too late that morning I was
going to breakfast with my friend George
ah and we were driving there and I was
looking at my phone and I was just cuz I
couldn't log into my Instagram and were
like I tried everything and I was ready
freshing my page and then one photo
popped opposite posted and it was like
free Kylie Jenner lip kits and I was
like fuck because I had just spent 7
grand to get my Instagram back and then
I got hacks now the reason why I clicked
that email the reason why I think that
email is because I thought it was from
like that arm Oh Bates manager like
organizing it because if I hadn't got
that randomly
wouldn't have done it and but prior to
that I don't think I'd ever gotten like
an email from Instagram with the blue
tick verification thing Jan I mean it
was just all in bad timing anyway
these hackers got into my Instagram they
started posting free Kylie Jenner lip
kits and free iPhones and my fucking
followers were fucking sending these
people money and buying them I had so
much backlash that this wasn't even the
beginning of it I had so much backlash
from moms and young girls and young boys
saying I want my money back I was
posting all over my personal Instagram
that I just made a few weeks before that
had happened saying don't click anything
like it's not me like I was spreading it
all across my social media do not click
anything I'm not giving away iPhones
it's a scam like don't send anyone money
that was all that was all good I was
working on getting my Instagram back I
had a really good connection to a music
industry in Australia who ended up
helping me through this whole process so
as I was posting on all my other social
medias don't click the links like this
isn't me a bloody blah blah blah don't
send anyone money these hackers
obviously got quite angry with me
because they weren't making any money
and a lot of my followers were messaging
my Instagram account being like which I
think it's fucking hilarious that they
were doing that like wasting their time
they were like hey I'm interested in a
free iPhone like a strats I don't know
my social medias like darn click the
link whatever I had people like because
I went because when I got my Instagram
back I went through all the dams and
there was so many people being like hey
I'm interested in a free iPhone and then
egg them on for like 20 messages and
then they'll be like nah fuck you
fucking hacker like fuck you and then so
the hackers will went getting their time
waster and they were getting so angry
which I was like shit there's literally
nothing I can do about I was getting
sent strange shots on Twitter and
everything but like whatever so then
these hackers were getting sorry I agree
because they weren't making any money or
they weren't getting anything out of the
whole hacking situation so what they
decided to do was they started posting
gay porn at this point I was like shit
this is really bad like I have very very
young followers and some of the older
generation - that would not appreciate
people just wouldn't appreciate that
life festival I mean I was the piano and
I was like this is disgusting like the
guys weren't even Hall and the dicks
were small bye so they started posting
the gay porn it was getting removed
after like a few minutes because of um
how many reports that Frodo was getting
and then that would just keep uploading
more and more and more and then they
were uploading stuffs like I don't even
want to talk about it but I'm just gonna
say it because this is how about a god
um
if you're not good at listening to
fucked up things then I suggest skip the
next 30 seconds they were posting like
animals getting killed alive they were
posting 911 memes like like you know
really bad stuff that had happened in
the world that were like jokes that were
made into a meme do you know what I mean
like as I said 9/11 then they started
posting no after that it was all deleted
quite quickly but then they started
posting like oh my god I don't even want
to say it they started posting videos
with sound of people getting beheaded
and at that point I went into my mom and
I was born I was bawling my eyes out of
like fuck this cannot be happening and I
had there was so many comments on all
the videos and photos from like moms
being like why the fuck would you post
this Michael like my daughter looks up
to you and I was like dude it's not me
and I really hope to this day they all
know that that was not me I think I
ended up losing like a hundred thousand
followers from that whole thing which
was totally understandable because I
would not want to be looking at that as
well like it was just absolutely fucked
up like it was fucked up it was not okay
as I said I had a really good connection
that helped me get my Instagram back for
free which was fantastic now they
managed that whole process this whole
process of the hackings happened four
times because this stupid asshole his
password was literally like three things
now it's very easy for a hacker to get
in when passwords are quite short there
weren't easy to guess but they were just
quite short and they have they have
technology to get in so my Instagram
password now is literally it probably
takes me at least 15 minutes to type in
and if you fuck one thing up he's gotta
do the whole thing again now after
getting my Instagram back because of all
those reports and the flags that had
happened on my account
from all those inappropriate photos that
were being posted though Instagram was
actually taking a look at it and then
deleting my account again so my account
probably got deleted at least 15 to 17
times it literally got to the point
where I had had enough lady who helped
me out getting it back from the music
industry I'm not gonna say it because I
don't want to like get her in trouble or
whatever she helped me get it back and I
actually had a Skype call with the
Instagram headquarters in Singapore
explaining the situation what had
happened so then they managed to wipe my
account of all flags and my interaction
went back up and everyone came back to
say hey and then that was that
yeah just stuck a little asshole and if
I ever have to go through that again I
will fuck people I will hire a private
investigator I'm not even kidding I will
hire a private investigator to find out
who did it to fuck with my shit do not
fuck with my shit I'm just saying if
you're a hater if you ever if you ever
try and come for me if you try to fuck
up my career if you try and do anything
to me I will ruin your life okay well
that was a throwback in time anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed it this video if
you have any more story times that you
do want to see make sure you leave me a
comment down below and I will do that I
so you have a few good ones in mind that
I really wanted err sorry I'll get to
them and in the meantime love you guys
and I'll see you all in my next video
