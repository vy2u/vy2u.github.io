today I'm going to be doing a fully full
video in depth video on how to contour
your nose lack of pro now I'm not the
best of contouring my nose but every
single time I do a tutorial and I
contour my nose people want to see a
video on how I contrary an in-depth one
so today I'm going to be doing that so
without any further ado let's jump
straight into this and I'll show you how
to snatch this nose down
okie dokie so first thing you want to
make sure of is that your nose is fully
concealed and Foundation and powdered
unless you want to do a cream contour
under here which I haven't done I've
just done foundation and then concealer
and set everything yeah just make sure
everything is the more flawless your
base is that better your contour is
going to look so the first product I'm
going to be using is the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer in the shade
deep 10 but it's in that bronzer so it's
okay and I'm going to be using this
brush here this is the sigma baek
precision you can use any russian
eyeshadow brush whatever works for you i
know there's like proper nose contouring
brushes out there but just use whatever
works for you so I'm just going to be
getting a little bit of product just on
the tip of the brush and tapping off the
excess that you don't need and then
what I'm going to do is start placing
this line see this line that I'm
creating exactly where you want to
already you can see that that's pulling
my nose in and fading this out it really
does depend on how strong you want your
nose contour to be
like it's actually not that hard like
the further you bring the two lines in
on the middle just some more snaps your
nose is going to look so the further hat
you have these lines the bigger that's
going to look pretty much the closer you
bring the easier the small your nose is
going to look basically just set that
twice but I just want to get my point
across and we're gonna be going down now
this is probably very extreme for a lot
of people this is more drag-queen II but
this is how I like to do is I really
want my nose looking good so big
now I'm moving on to the bottom of the
nose I don't know if anyone ever notices
this but my nose is actually really
uneven on this side and this side this
ledge really short on this sides really
long now that I've spotted oh you're
probably all going to notice that you're
gonna hate it as much than I do but
that's right so I'm just running that
contour underneath because I want to cut
that under there and snatch that
and I'm going to bring it up into these
I'm just kind of creating like a
triangle I don't really know what I'm
doing I'm just doing it until it works
okay now what I'm doing is I'm just kind
of getting the tip of the brush and
doing a line so it's gonna kind of be
like a ball on the bottom in your nose
just kind of creating like a new ball
here and that is taking a bronzer this
is the Ofra bronzer and americano you
just want a blending brush and what I'm
doing is kind of just blending this into
the side if you like this really adds so
much to a nose contour and I'm just
bringing it down the side of the nose
now this is also going to make it look
so so intense also I can't forget to
mention can't stress enough bring your
nose contour up into the start of your
eyebrow because there's no point
contouring your nose if you don't do
that at the end of the day it's your
nose you contour how you want everyone's
going to have their opinion but they
don't matter because nobody asked them
I'm just kind of bringing that right
down this side of my nose but don't
worry we're going to pinch it together
later
oh she is snatched under she had
a nervous trouble what I'm just gonna be
taking this banana powder from a bar ah
just on the same brush that I use I just
have to off it and I'm just going
to be placing that directly down the
middle of my nose now this is going to
kind of diffuse the two lines on the
side here I'm just bringing that up once
again I'm just going back and blending
those edges out alright so the next step
is kind of crucial this is going to help
pinch your nose in even more so what I'm
going to be doing is taking the Ofra
banana powder again on this brush here
and I'm going to take quite a bit of
that and what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to go in from the side and
start pressing this up against that line
see how that pulls that right in and
kind of tricks the eye just make sure
it's completely blended out when you're
doing it
see how that's pulled up siding
completely on this side still like
chillin yeah that's what I mean now it's
going to take that brush again that I
had the bronzer on and just slightly
blend a little bit down not too much
where you want to like defeat the
purpose of what you've just done but
just kind of blend that down a little
bit now to powder highlight I'm going to
be taking artist Couture in the shade
consider that's what I've used on the
rest of my face just on a little brush
like this and I'm just going to dip that
in and then right along that nose bridge
just bring a little bit of life back to
that nose very shimmery this bronzer
this highlighter and then you just want
to basically set that well this is the
Ofra setting spray and that is pretty
much it I hope you guys enjoyed and you

your nose and if you have any other
videos that you want me to do leave a
comment down below and I will be happy
to accommodate I'll see you guys in my
