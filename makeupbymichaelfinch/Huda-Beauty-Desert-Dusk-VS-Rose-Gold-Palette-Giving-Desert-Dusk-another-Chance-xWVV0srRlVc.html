God I've got myself into a bit of a
fest here have an iron like a bush pig
in a test sorry if you guys start
nerd I did a first impressions hit or
miss on the huda beauty rose gold
sorry huda beauty desert desert dusk
palette a few days ago and it didn't go
very well and it is spiked with a storm
on the internet I woke up this morning
with an influx of hate messages say that
I don't know how to do makeup and
especially after nikkietutorials video I
came out everyone saying that I'm not a
makeup artist and I don't know how to do
makeup I don't know how to blend I
should I don't know if I'm using people
are saying that I'm not using the right
tools people are saying it over
exaggerated people are saying that I did
it for views Lola so today I'm gonna be
putting the palette to the test for a
second time and we're gonna see how it
goes
so if you watch my last video I use the
top shape tape to prime my lids instead
I'm gonna be using the Mac select cover
up concealer and today I'm gonna be
using these sticky tape method on my
eyes okay alright so I'm taking a little
bit of the Mac's Alexia cover-up
concealer so I'm just gonna take that
all across my lid no I don't know why
taht shape tape let me down
whether it was that all the palette but
I've never had a problem before with
using taht shape tape as my eye base so
I'm intrigued to see if this does make a
difference the reason why I'm giving it
a second girl ulcer is because I know a
lot of you guys are like well I mean it
works and he's just not using it
properly I used that I should I felt I
could use any other eyeshadow palette I
just don't understand what's going on
and especially after seeing Nicki's
video and how well it looked like how
well it went
I'm like maybe I did do something
wrong but I don't know so let's put it
to the test today and try something a
little bit different I'm just gonna
blend this concealer out with just this
fluffy brush here rather than using a
Beauty Blender so I've put a really thin
layer of concealer on and I'm really
hoping this does work you guys like I
really want this palette to work I hope
Todd shaped Kate was the reason and the
dermablend powder that nothing was going
right but I still think the for me
has changed a little bit in this palette
or a lot hence why it didn't work for me
okay once that's all blended I'm just
gonna take some of the Rimmel stay matte
powder and I'm just gonna set that in
place just gently set over the lids not
baking at all not putting an excessive
amount of powder on okay now let's take
this baby still gagging they're in the
packaging I'm obsessed with it first I'm
gonna be taking the shade called Eden
just on this fluffy brush here just
gently dabbing in and that's what
happens so people saying that I am
digging into the palette to make it look
worse than it actually is
eat my little asshole okay so I'm just
gonna go in with Eden and already that
is Bella I'm excited I'm excited
sir I'm gonna take Eden Eden ooh it
reminds me of when I went to New Zealand
and I was going up Mount Eden with Chris
Mount Eden ooh there oh my god this is
working I'm sorry much better already
guys if this works I know that the tart
shaped a pin the dermablend powder was
the thing that it in the first
place so I'm gonna be blending Eden Oh
I've actually got goose bumps
I've got literal goose bumps because if
this is the problem this is a problem
that come by first if he has a different
part you're not yeah and I am putting it
all across my entire crease
okay so once Aidan is on my eye and then
gonna go in with a shade called blazing
which is the orange shade that I used in
my first video and I'm gonna pop that in
my outer V and kind of bring it up
through the crease actually I'm not
gonna use that I'm gonna go in with
saffron instead just because I think
it's gonna match with Eden a bit more
you guys that is so much better that is
so much better I'm just gonna take a
little bit more Eden and just blend out
lightly I'm gonna bring saffron all the
way into my inner corner and keep
blending that they don't take a little
bit more
eat in and just blend out this pot on
the inner corner here
now I'm synagogue aim with this brush
here it's a little bit different and I'm
gonna take more of saffron and I'm gonna
see if I can pack on more color and
blend it through my crease just lightly
now I'm gonna take this little doing
shape during mache brush here and I'm
gonna take a bit of the shade called
dude which is the dark brown and I'm
gonna pop that on my outer corner so I'm
just gonna Pat before I blend it then
we're gonna go back in with this brush
and a little bit more saffron and see if
this blends without losing
okay so I definitely did lose all my ear
when I did put that down don't know why
I'm just gonna take a bit of the shade
called amber and I'm gonna try and
deepen up the outer corner I don't think
it's gonna work no not really
so I said I was gonna take my saffron
and just pack that on and try and build
up the color I honestly don't think this
is as pigmented as the textured rose
gold palette still and I feel like the
shadows are a little bit more drier okay
now that we've got that down pat let's
do let's do what Nikki did okay so let's
do what Nikki did she kind of got her
concealer and she did like a semi sort
of cop crease which is what I'm gonna do
so okay so I've kind of got my cut
crease going on here I'm just gonna take
this little brush and kind of blend out
the concealer so it's not just a harsh
line maybe I'm not gonna use that maybe
let's go in with Blood Moon Blood Moon
looks a little bit more promising should
I wet the brush a little bit as I pop
this on she's like a little spritz of
fix+
I'm just gonna pop all the way in where
I put that concealer okay so there it is
you guys okay guys sir I'm pretty much
done with this uh so I'm just gonna take
off the tape
and I'm gonna clean up underneath my eye
a little bit with a makeup white glue
okay so definitely with using the
concealer the different concealer it has
changed quite a lot but what I am gonna
do now you guys I really want to use the
purple from the desert dust palette and
do another shot but I'm actually gonna
compare this eye and I'm gonna do this I
with the textured rose gold eyeshadow
palette because I still believe that
this palette is so much better than this
one okay and let's put it to the test
regarding pigmentation all out as this
palette does not have much fallout at
all when you dig into it but the desert
dust as soon as you go into it it just
 fests everywhere and I mean
people can try and twist that and deny
it that it's only got a little bit but
it doesn't it's got a ton but
whatever okay guys so I'm gonna be going
in with my cleaning brushes with the
texture of rose gold eyeshadow palettes
or the first shade I'm gonna be taking
is sandalwood here this beautiful brown
and like as you can see okay we've got
no like crazy fallout at all like it's
it's good it's perfect okay and I'm
gonna start by popping this through my
crease okay like already that is sorry
pigmented like are you serious
okay so I'm gonna bring this off and now
I'm just gonna blend that out cuz this
is gonna be the transition for today you
guys
okay already you can see this has a lot
more pigmentation and literally no
 fallout come at me next I'm
gonna be taking the shade here called
henna this baby right here and I'm gonna
be popping Hannah ah sorry pigmented and
I'm gonna be popping this over and
underneath sandalwood look how
pigmented this is you guys like are you
kidding me now a lot of people were
actually commenting on my video you just
don't know how to do eyeshadow you don't
know how to blend please stop talking
like these colors in here just sorry
much more pigmented hence why it's my
favorite eyeshadow palette in the
literal world now I'm gonna take the
shade called cocoa and I'm gonna pop
that directly below and I'm gonna kind
of bring it up a little bit and a little
bit through my crease like I love that
so much it looks seamless to me and very
pigmented now I'm gonna take the shade
called black truffle which is one of the
best black eye shadows I've ever used in
my life I'm just gonna pop that on the
outer V and I'm just gonna sweep that a
little bit and then we're just gonna
keep that there and I'm gonna blend that
out with a little bit more of cocoa just
taking cocoa on this brush and just
blending it slightly just gonna take a
little bit more hand out just on this
blending brush and just kind of go over
the edge of everything and now I'm gonna
take a little bit of sandalwood and just
pop that above cuz I did lose my
transition that was my fault just gonna
pop that up out there okay perfect
now for my lid color I'm just gonna take
this shade called man-eater which is
this stunning like berry tone and I'm
just gonna pop that directly on my lid
look at the pigment you guys I die they
don'ts going to take that same brush
those using it earlier and I'm just
gonna kind of blend over the edges
please tell me why these other colors
are not as pigmented as
the textured worth gold has the formula
changed 100% let me give you guys an
example these are way more buttery I'm
just gonna swirl around in this palette
like that how I normally would and not
that much full that comes off okay and
I'm just gonna take a little bit of this
oh okay okay okay guys so here is the
finished look so my overall thoughts on
that desert dust palette I still don't
like it I still don't like it I still
don't think the colors are anywhere near
as pigmented as the textured rose gold
as you can see huge difference and when
I was packing on the colors like
obviously they're different colors I
know there's black in here it's gonna be
more pigmented but the fact that they
blend better the fact that there's not
much kick off at all in the textured
rose gold and there is an absolute
ton of kick off in this palette you can
deny all you want but there is a lot
okay and I know a lot of youtubers
probably weren't sure they kick off in
this palette so I just showed you guys
but I'm gonna show you again here we
have it does its and just regularly how
I would do that and boom Wow all right
you guys sir I'm gonna leave this video
at this I still don't like this palette
I'm literally obsessed with this
palette and I always will be it is
literally my favorite who da if you're
watching if you're gonna take my advice
after this video probably not because
I've literally just bashed your palette
because on YouTube here on my channel
everyone gets my honest opinions my
subscribers get my honest opinions of
products regardless whether I'm on their
PR list or not if I do get sent it for
free I'm still gonna give you guys my
honest opinion probably after these two
videos I'm gonna be fully off who to be
these PR lists but I don't really care
to be honest because if I want to buy
her makeup to try out I'll just buy it
myself I hope you guys really enjoyed
this video if you did make sure you give
it a massive thumbs up I love you guys
so much and I will see you all in my
next video bye see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
