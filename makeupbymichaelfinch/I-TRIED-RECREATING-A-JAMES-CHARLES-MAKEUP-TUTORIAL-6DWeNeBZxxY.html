today I'm gonna be doing a I'm actually
recreating James Charles Koch a look now
I haven't discussed with this look it's
stunning it looks stunning on sister
James so I have want to trade credit for
quite a long time so I'm gonna go ahead
and do it today it's just something
different a little bit fun I want to say
what this looks like on me because I
love the look like it's stunning so yeah
let's just get straight into it now
James looks literally sorry snatched in
this I'm going to leave a photo here of
what it looks like it's literally so
late and he's noise looks so so snaps so
I'm gonna see if I can get my nose semi
snatched because we all know have a big
schnoz so first step just to prep my
eyes I'm gonna be taking these
heart-shaped tape in the shade of light
and I'm gonna put this all across my
eyes to use as a base for my shadows I'm
not gonna put as much as I normally do
gonna blend this out as per usual yeah
I'm using this really light white
concealer because um I want the shadows
to really pop like the colours and
because it is a lot of color and then
black it's gonna make the colors pop out
a lot more when the black goes down but
I'm actually really scared to go
straight in with black over the colors
but we're just gonna see how we go this
could this video could be a sale like
this video could be a sale but
who knows it's gonna run over that with
a little bit of translucent powder just
to set it into place and just using the
Australis fresh and flawless in the
shade nude now assuming you guys right
in sorry I'm gonna be going in with my
Jacqueline Hill morphe palette and I'm
gonna be taking this really like dark
orange actually no the first year I'm
gonna take is this brown sort of shade
just to get a bit of a transition going
on now I'm gonna bring be bringing my
shadows up quite high today sorry I'm
just gonna be going off the photo off
James's Instagram like trying to
replicate that I haven't actually like
fully watched the makeup tutorial
because I hate watching makeup tutorials
I normally just skip through them
because I feel like I can just like work
off a photo do you know what I mean like
I'd rather do that just by looking at it
so I'm just gonna pop that color down
now I want to drag the shadows out quite
far like James has as well don't know
how I'm gonna go with that but we're
just gonna give it a whirl
now I'm gonna be going in with this
really intense orange shade from the
Jacqueline Hill pal
and I'm Morris are just gonna be placing
it up quite high and then kind of like
winging that out because it's kind of
like a I look like I'd like dot gonna
drag this orange shade sort of throw and
just blending that it's gonna go back in
with the brush that I used before and
take a little bit more that transition
because we just lost some of that and
just run over the edge of that orange
now it kind of looks like James used a
little bit of red sorry I'm gonna be
using a million palettes today to get
this look I'm just gonna be taking this
red shade from them to natasha gennarino
sunset palettes and I'm just going to
add that in to this race area like just
in the middle here just to bring some
red into that and we're taking a little
bit more of that orange shade and
packing that in now as I'm moving on to
the inner part of the eye he's got a
nice bright yellow so I'm gonna be
taking two yellow from it from that
Natasha generator palette can't even
talk today and I'm gonna be popping that
into my inner corner yeah yeah perfect
this whole look is literally just like
blending different colors together and
just going back in and out with
different colors which is cool I'm cool
with that so I'm gonna go in with the
morphe brushes 35b palette and I'm gonna
be taking the orange shade just here out
of that and attempting to get that
up in cool so I think we're pretty good
stars I'm just adding a little bit more
of that orange shade from the Jaclyn
hill palette just on the out of the to
bring it in a little bit
okay so now I'm suddenly taking a black
eye shadow you guys can use any black
eyeshadow I'm just using the one from
the soft glam palette from Anastasia
just on this little tiny brush this is
the makeup geek defined crease brush and
I'm scared it's gonna grind very
sparingly with this try to bring not bad
he's going back in with the orange from
the jaclyn hill palette that I was using
originally I'm just trying to go over
the edges of the black kind of blended
together sweater government black
eyeshadow is terrifying like when it's
like this it's like it's terrifying it
scares me so James kind of brings the
black eyeshadow into about here and then
kind of lets it fade out so I'm just
gonna go halfway across the eye and then
just kind of stop that right here taking
some more of that orange eyeshadow from
Jaclyn hill just blending over the edges
well first gonna dip into a little bit
of that read from the Natasha - Nonna
palette and pop a little bit more of
that just in here above that black cuz
we lost some of that a little blending
now getting started on the other eye
it's pretty much just green blue and
purple which is really nice colors so
I'm just gonna go in with this green
from the morphe 35o palette and I'm
going to pop this on my inner corner so
right in here then I'm gonna be taking
this blue from the morphe palette and
i'm gonna start focusing that on the
middle part of the eye okay and I'm
gonna be blending at this purple into
the blue looks really messy at the
moment but once it's all blended out its
gonna look well I hope it's gonna look
like a
should I take a bit more of that blur
and blend it into that purpose I like
fades together it's gonna kind of turn
into like a darker blue which is called
we want that wow we're done I'm gonna
start blending out the edges of this
best as I can kind I'm gonna take some
of this pinkish out I know James didn't
have it in his thing but I'm gonna take
some of this pinky shade from the mathy
palette and I'm gonna pop it over the
edge of the purple just taking some more
purple over the edge of the purple that
I've already put down to try and blend
it out up this morphe palette actually
so led this purple shade is so good now
I want to incorporate a little bit more
of a darker blue so I'm gonna take this
turquoise he showed from the Jaclyn hill
morphe palette I'm so using like four
different palettes I'm sorry guys but I
just want this to look you know pretty
okay and I'm gonna pop that like in the
middle that darken and up a little bit I
guess yeah that's right
actually it's gonna be taking a little
bit of the darker blue shade from the
morphe palette and just popping it next
to that purple we're just kind of darken
it up so when I put the black down it's
not so like whoa like relax do you know
what I mean a little bit more of that a
light blue just pop in here or I want to
blend out onto my brow here like a bit
better but I'm scared that's right
okay just moving on to the black
eyeshadow I'm just gonna be popping it
on and putting it in like the wing sort
of shape but I do it exactly the same
and the other eye just trying to get
them semi even I guess and once again
the black kind of goes to about the
middle of the eye so I'm just gonna
bring it all the way in here
guys let's use this failing does this
look any good
I have no idea what James did on his
eyelid sorry I'm just gonna go ahead and
look at the YouTube video okay so James
in the video he has done a cut crease
with silver glitter on the lid sorry I'm
gonna take my sharp shape tape and do a
cut crease this Hey sorry I'm just gonna
take some of that on the back of my arm
and start mapping out where I'm gonna do
this cat crease okay nice line thank you
now I'm just gonna speed this pot up you
guys um because it will just take a
while just sit back relax grab a snack
grab a dick and watch just gonna set
that concealer a little bit of nude
shadow we're gonna be covering this up
anyway but I just like to set the
concealer before we go in with glitter
or glitter glue or anything like that
and I'm just gonna pop the edges just
like that we're gonna fix up the outer V
afterwards but now I'm just gonna go in
with the Too Faced glitter glue and pop
a little bit of that on the back of my
arm all over where the concealer is now
the glitter I'm gonna be using is this
one from Mac it's the Mac silver glitter
heaven is this in a long time I'm trying
to place that on there as perfectly as I
can
what is our good oh my gosh it's like
fine but like glittery that's looking
really really good
that's exactly how I wanted it to the
delay now going back in with a little
bit more black just on this eyeshadow
brush normally I wouldn't stop with
black eyeshadow and glitter glue but
because it is so dark it shouldn't
matter all that much okay that's perfect
I'm just gonna leave this at that and
I'm just gonna go ahead and do the other
eye and then I'll come back and we can
keep going
now I'm sorry taking the NYC liquid
liner and I'm just gonna quickly be
going along my lash line very carefully
I just this one up because I
tried to transfer although out there
which is so rude just like that it's
super easy now to taking the Mac
extended play gigablack lash mascara I'm
just going to cart' my top lashes now
the last rows I'm gonna be using today
are from a brand called cast Beauty and
these are in the style Molly
they're super fluffy but not too because
I don't want to cover up all the work
that I've just jumped out I'm just gonna
be taking a little bit of the House of
lashes black lash square just on the
back of my head oh can that ride work
shut the
ah ah ah brat I'm so sorry if you can
hear that banging out there it's been
going constantly non-stop for so long
bang 6 a.m. to 5 o'clock 6 o'clock every
day
over it but I have to film so I'm just
gonna go ahead and pop this lash on
perfect so that's just sitting on there
quite nicely hasn't covered up too much
of anything which is good that's exactly
what we want just gonna go ahead and pop
the other one on and I will be right
back ok so my eyes are pretty much done
on the top we're gonna be moving on to
the face now it's got my hair out of my
face I'm looking like a touch-up lady
sis now to prime my face I'm gonna be
trying out this and you want some tatcha
this is the silk canvas filter finish
protective primer so it's kind of like a
form of a balm I guess I don't really
know how I would apply this I guess I'm
just gonna be taking it on me
gah I'm like popping it on like this I
don't know I really don't know smells
really good it smells like this skincare
range YUM rubbing it into all the areas
of my face that needs primary wear okay
guys so my foundation today I'm just me
taking the GA essential high coverage
cream foundation in the shade shell so
I'm just gonna be squirting that onto
the back of my hand as per usual and I'm
gonna speed this whole process up a
little bit for let's go now if you
conceal of course I'm just going to be
using the shape tag once again just
putting that on my nerves
Cupid's bar chin and under my eyes you
guys know the drill
easy I'm just gonna drink that much and
go with that now to bake all of this
into place I'm just really taking my
Patrick Starr
since loosened powder and baking the
absolute out of my undereyes and
mine are is as usual you guys don't
always do this I just feel like it helps
keep the makeup on that huh that is
taking my Australis fresh and flawless
I'm just going to set the rest of all my
foundation so it does not move and it
powders everything down ready for
contour bronzer and all that sort of fun
stuff alright guys for my waterline I'm
just really taking the essence
long-lasting black eye pencil and I'm
just gonna pop this in here still really
about it doing my waterline Oh
now I'm gonna be going back into the
color so I'm gonna be doing pretty much
what I did on top of the eye but
underneath with the same sort of color
combos if that makes sense
going straight back in with that orange
shade from the Jaclyn hill palette I'm
just gonna be popping that under my eye
on the outer corner now I'm just gonna
be taking at that yellow eyeshadow that
I used from the Natasha denote a palette
and I'm just gonna be popping a under my
eye icon in a corner now I'm just gonna
go in with my black eyeshadow again and
I'm gonna go right up against my
lashline I'm gonna bring this black down
quite a bit and then I'm gonna smoke
into that orange and into that yellow
and adding more of the orange shade
underneath the black I'm actually gonna
bring the orange shade under the black
here too because the yellow is too light
to blend into it okay stick pretty happy
with that now I'm gonna go ahead and do
the essence liner on this eye as well
okay so under this eye I'm just gonna be
taking that dark purple from the morphe
palette again hoping that right
underneath where that black is now I'm
gonna go back in with that turquoise eye
shade from the Jaclyn hill palette and
pop that right underneath my inner
corner okay taking that purple shade
from the morphe palette again just
popping it underneath and I'm blending
that down slightly now just to finish
off the eyes I'm just gonna be popping
on the mac extended play gigablack lash
on my bottom lashes okay guys so now I'm
ready to contour I'm gonna be taking at
the it cosmetics you sculpted contour
kits and I'm gonna be taking this on the
Mac 168 brush and I'm gonna take this
cool tone shade just here I'm gonna
begin by trying I'm gonna try make my
jaw line super to find cuz James has the
most defined jaw line I've ever seen
I'm just strategically placing this
contour powder it kind of seems my nose
and as much as I can
you're gonna blend it out off down now
I'm just gonna take my blending brush
and blend it okay that's looking pretty
snatched so my bronzer I'm just gonna be
taking d c---eight a London South Beach
Bruns off that's gonna go ham on the
bronze are literally putting up all over
my face I really like this buns I
haven't used this in so long
letting it down the sides of my nose as
well and all down my neck is so all
matches up for my blush today I'm just
gonna be taking a peaches from Mac and
I'm just gonna put a little bit of this
on pause for bringing a little bit of
color back Vic now for my highlighter
today I've been why don't you try this
not for such a long time this is the
Stila kits in heavens hue highlighter so
it's kind of like a posse I guess but
I'm gonna take it on a brush and see how
it applies to my skin all right this
doesn't up the whole look there's
something I really lightly over where I
normally put highlighter okay sorry I
might use this as like a base for the
highlight and then go over it with like
an actual powder one and see if it
stands out a bit more taking a smaller
brush and I'm gonna pop it on my inner
corners quite generously cuz I'm gonna
go over it with a powder cause in the
threat of James he's got a really really
strong inner corner highlight and he's
got a really strong pilot right here
middle
it's gonna run this on my Cupid's bow
but with this other brush now this
highlighter that I'm going to be trying
out for the first time today this is by
nas this is the Fort de France so I'm
gonna give this a whirl but I'm just
gonna take this on my honest RCIA 23
brush and I'm just gonna go oh yeah I
love this the combination of the two
really makes it pop and it doesn't bring
out too much texture either which is
nice I like to bring my highlight down
onto my cheek and I feel like it just
looks better as you can see it when you
straight on out on the side it makes you
look really oily not oily but like
dramatic intense it's gonna take some of
that highlighter and pop it on the tip
of my nose gonna move on to this a
really tiny brush and a little bit of
highlight in there so it's like really
intense and then I'm just gonna pack it
on to my inner corners a little bit on
this Cupid's bow okay you're looking at
pretty dramatic which is fine
okay guys I've just hooked on some
jewels onto my face just here and here
like James has in the footer I'm just
gonna set my face with the all nighter
pollution protection urban decay setting
spray now I'm not really sure what James
had on his lips but I'm going to get
something right now that is very extra
