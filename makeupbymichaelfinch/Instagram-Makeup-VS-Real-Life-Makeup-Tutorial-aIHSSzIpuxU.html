today I'm gonna be showing you guys how
to get this real life versus Instagram
makeup now obviously the other side is
obviously not my real life gift my real
life is the Instagram site but it's just
for the concept of the video and shout
out to promise span for creating this I
guess let's get straight into it so
starting off with the Melo cosmetics dip
brow pomade in the shade top I'm just
going to do my eyebrows first now on the
Instagram side I'm going to be making
them a lot thicker a lot more villany
and just a lot more defined in general
and I really like this look this is what
I love doing everyday to be honest so
this should be on the everyday side as
well but as I said for the concept of
the video I'm going to be keeping it
very minimal on the other side because
that's the whole point of the video you
know on the other side I'm literally
just scraping a little bit through my
eyebrow like not even creating a shape
really just going where the natural
hairs are and just filling that in at
the front there if that makes any sense
you know what I mean
see what I mean look sorry different
from the other one now just going on
some tart shape taking can walk whoa
whoa now let's try that again I'm just
taking the tight shape tape concealer
and putting that underneath my brow and
concealing that until it looks nice and
perfect on the bottom and then I'm just
taking a little bit of concealer on the
other eyebrow and just cleaning up
underneath that edge now on the
Instagram side I am going to be
concealing the top of my eyebrow but on
the other side I'm not going to be
because that's just not real laughs is
it well it might be for some people who
knows anyway I'm just blending out that
concealer and now going in with primer
this is the professional from benefit
guys I forgot how much I love this it
smells so good it goes on so smoothly
and it's very liquidy which is also
really good now on the Instagram side
I'm taking the Marc Jacobs remarkable
foundation
in the shade bisque light this is so
full coverage I'm just using my morphe
g36 brush to blend that out
I find that better to use than a beauty
blender when using this foundation but
sometimes I use a beauty blender if I
want to say yeah I'm just getting
absolute full coverage as you can see I
just like to was took what was what whoa
oh my god I literally can't even talk
today what is going on oh my god I call
anyway on the real oh my god on the real
left side I'm just taking the Milani
because I could conceal foundation she's
in the shade oh I don't know all
right but it's really yellow on the turn
you guys know I love yellow undertone
foundations and just let some concealer
i'm using the maybelline fit me putting
that underneath my eye and over my
eyelid to create a base to my shadows
then I'm just taking my Real Techniques
sponge and I'm blending that out so it
is seamless and then just taking a
little bit of my ass but I'm just kind
of not really baking I'm just kind of
pressing that powder in so I'm not
really leaving any powder to sit there
I'm just pressing it in just to set that
concealer and moving on to the Instagram
side I'm just going back in with the
tight shaped tape and applying a really
generous amount of this stuff because
not that you need it because it's super
full coverage and it basically sets
itself but you guys know I love to go
overboard with my concealer regardless
of how good the coverage was so I'm just
blending that out with my sponge what
something most leave a comment down
below of what side you guys prefer the
instagrams side or the real-life side or
maybe wait until the end until your
comment that I'm not sure anyway I'm
just blending that all out and putting
that all over my eyelid as well she uses
a base for my shadows and then before
that gets a chance to crease I'm just
baking the absolute out of
underneath my eyes my eyelid and not
half of my face now to set the
foundation on the other side of my face
I'm just taking the Australis fresh and
flawless in the shade darkest Brown for
my eyes today we're going to be doing
something very
Instagram it's is kind of inspired by
shining should
a little tutorial the other day that was
like using this palette with pinks and
 and I was like oh that's stunning
so props to you babe I'm just putting
that flamingo or through my crease and
just making sure that's all blended out
guys these shadows blend so seamlessly
and this pink one is kind of patchy when
you first start but once you start to
build it up oh my god amazing now we're
taking the color
I missed that and I'm putting that
through the crease just to give it more
depth I guess like we're starting to
darken this up now oh my god it looks so
good I love this look so much sorry
pretty pink colors are just aa stun now
taking the shade Abbasi now the reason I
keep looking at my camera is because it
kept going out of focus like you guys
have no idea how much was pissing me off
this day that's why I'm I keep pausing
I'm like looking at the camera see did
you see it just then yeah when out of
focus what do you know and then I'm just
taking it those basically those three
colors just under my eye and smoking
that out and just starting to define
that out of II a little bit more by
adding a bit more of a darker color now
I do go in with this black but the whole
time I was blending it and putting it on
the camera was out of focus and I'm not
putting that in the video because it
does look like so I just
kind of put that through the crease this
was the only part that was in focus
thank God and I start putting a little
bit of that underneath my eye to just
using it this little flat angled sort of
brush right up against my lash line now
just going back in with a little bit
more concealer from Tarte I'm just going
to be putting this all over my lid what
I'm gonna be doing any sort of cut
crease today because I wasn't feeling a
cut crease or anything like that I'm
just putting that on my lid just to use
as a base for the next color that I'm
putting over so it's very pigmented and
you can see it very well so I'm just
going to be taking the color called
shine and just popping that all over the
lid area until it's all covered and then
I'm just gonna go back in with a little
blending brush and just blend out those
edges to make it kind of seamless but I
forgot to perfectly pin clearly now
we're just taking sandalwood and henna
and I'm basically just popping that on
my entire eyelid and then just blending
all of that up so this is like two nice
brown shades they look so pretty there
good for green blue eyes because the
orangey warm brown makes your eyes pop
severely like sorrow good and just a
little bit of that underneath my eye
also just to hit my eye nasan okay now
for a wing I'm gonna be using the
Maybelline studio gel liner and guys I'm
pretty sure it gets to the point where I
just glide down out of the frame there
was actually this Mane made the other
day I'll insert it here it was so funny
that was like if I don't text you back
this is what I'm doing it's like for
youtubers and I'm the only one out of
the frame when I'm doing my
lower lash like so funny because
it's so true because I'm the only one
who's always out of frame gives my I'm a
shithead and I don't know what I'm doing
anyway I'm just taking a bit of the to
face it better than a dick mascara and
putting that on both of my lashes top
and bottom I believe alright and then
I'm just dusting off the rest of that
bake and just popping on a lash from
iris beauty in the style feel this these
are so friggin long I basically hit my
eyebrows these lashes are definitely not
for everyone but if you want for that
extra dramatic look which is what I
always go for then these lashes are
perfect for you oh there I go see I just
went out of frame again look do you want
to stay around anyway Jen what she
didn't even want used to see how I put
my lashes on so now I'm just like
dusting off the rest of that baked on my
face I guess with this fluffy brush and
now we're going in with some bronzer
this is max to give me some best longer
ever until I find another one that's
better
I'm just taking that on a brush and just
severely starting to bronze up my whole
face my cheekbone and then we're gonna
do my jaw line like this is so harsh
this bronzer is a lot it's very Orange
probably chew orange to this foundation
color but I don't care
I'll just bling that across my forehead
as well around my temples and just
really intensifying the whole bronzer
look on the Instagram side which I love
and then just taken whatever is left on
that brush I'm just going in on the real
life side and just bronzing up a little
bit as you can see so my cheekbone my
forehead and a little bit on my jaw line
and a little bit down the side
my nose also now just taking that give
me Sun again I'm just going down the
slide of the Instagram side now this
looks sorry interns I didn't actually
realize it was going to look like a big
orange line down the side of my nose
until I actually started doing it but
don't stress because I fixed that all up
later you can read me as much as you
want but I fix it up anyway then I'm
just contouring with that Anastasio
Beverly Hills contour kit down the side
of my nose again on my cheekbone my
forehead trying to make it look a little
bit smaller down the side of my temples
I think that area is called and then a
sheet over underneath my jawline to give
the airport of orange to give the
appearance of a smaller looking face
which is what I want very bad day and
then just whatever's left on the brush
I'm just going over the real life side
and just doing a tiny bit of contouring
all so there you go there's a jawline
for you
oh there we go now just applying a
little bit of math extended play just on
my Instagram side and then just baking
my nose to get rid of that all that
pigment and then about 30 seconds later
I just brushed it all off you have to
leave it on for long when you're using
the S bun or the RCM a because it's very
works very quick just taking a little
bit of gimme brow just both through both
of my brows to get rid of that powder
that was sitting in them and it'll just
give it more of a fresh little look do
you not I mean you know and then I'm
just taking my Tarte blush in the shade
true love oh this is my all-time
favorite blush from Tarte I just found
this in my Alex drawers the other day
hmm love it
now just taking a bit of the banana
powder from the UH Nastasia kit I'm just
running that across the top of my nose
bridge and also placing it down the side
now placing it down the side is going to
bring it in a little a little bit more
and it's going to make my nose look
smaller and that bronzer and that
contour is not going to look as intense
taking a little bit of mac fix+ just
spraying that all over my face and then
going in with makeup geek so less store
highlighter I think that's how you say
it as soon as I started applying this on
my oh my god I didn't realize what
but I guess it is a joy crime so that's
the whole point of it anyway I'm just
applying that with my uh Nastasia
highlighter brush and yes it's just
reminds me of the moon child glow kid
you know lean on the real life side
we're just gonna be using Mac's double
gleam highlighter very quickly I like it
going around the tops of my brows my
cheekbones and now for the lips we're
using a hooter Beauty dick
I forget what this is called don't worry
I'll leave it down below it was either
cheerleader or transmitter or bombshell
I'm shallow trendsetter I don't know
they're both my favorite on the
Instagram side I just over land the
absolute out of them which is what
I always do and then on the real left
side I'm just taking makeup geeks plush
matte lip cream in the shade peach bunny
and just popping that on and not over
lining them and then oh this is too fast
for me and then underneath I just put
some of the tight inner rim Atlanta on
the real life side so I hope you guys
