channel so today I'm gonna be doing a
monthly favorites video I want to try
and do monthly favorites videos every
single month only if I have enough stuff
to show you guys so yeah last year I was
really really really bad at doing
monthly favorites consistently so I
would like to keep them up this year if
I can if I have enough stuff to show you
guys this month I've got quite a lot now
this stuff that I'm showing guys in
particularly hasn't a lot of it hasn't
come out this month like if January but
it's what I've been absolutely loving
some things are new that have just come
out but yeah if you guys enjoy monthly
favorites videos make sure you give this
a massive thumbs up just so I know to do
more and yeah let's get straight into
the video
okay so the first thing I wanted to talk
about is this liquid lipstick yup I
crush cosmetics now this is not
sponsored I just wanted to put this out
here I've just been told about this
lipstick and I just wanted to share it
with you guys because it's a great cause
so basically this is made in memory of a
little boy he was two years old his name
was Cooper brown and he died from
childhood cancer at the age of two years
old as I just said so crush cosmetics
made this lipstick in memory of him and
every single lipstick that is sold two
dollars goes to Camp quality and I know
the crush cosmetics also does like a
bulk of donation each month and then
every single lipstick that is sold which
is two dollars of this goes to Camp
quality which is raising funds for
cancer etc etc cancer is something
that's extremely close to my heart
because I lost my grandma from it so if
you guys could go and support this that
would be absolutely amazing I will leave
the link down below where to purchase
this and I'm currently wearing on my
lips right now so I'm gonna do makeup
first and then I've also got like some
favorite songs like some paper youtubers
have been watching this month some
fragrances and some clothing and whatnot
but I don't want to ramble on for ages
cuz I hate favorite videos that go for
so long I'm just like shut up
and get on with it
show me the next thing what do I need to
add to my card in Sephora so y'all knew
it was coming this is the nas an actual
radiant long wear foundation this is in
the shade at UConn it's got a beautiful
pinky undertone I've actually got this
on my skin right now too
I'm literally obsessed with this it's
got like a nice glow to it and it's also
super super super full coverage so you
can build up coverage and cover your
entire skin I've literally been using
this left right and center so I think
the next thing I wanted to show you guys
this is the professional pearl primer
from benefit this is their new one it's
a pink version of it it kind of smells
like bubblegum and it's got like a knife
it's got like a knife it's got like a
nice soft pink undertone to it it pretty
much just is the same as professional in
my opinion but it does smell really
really good and has a pink undertone to
it but I do really like this and it's
good I'm glad I bought out anyone
because I'm kind of getting sick of just
seeing the green bottle bed you know
what I mean so now they changed it up
and we've got this the next thing I've
been loving is the Charlotte Tilbury
magic
cream this is like the best moisturizer
ever to go underneath your makeup I
don't use this as a moisturizer in
particular but I do use it underneath my
makeup and it does make my skin look
good because the keys are having
flawless looking foundation and a nice
complexion when you've got makeup on is
to have a nice moisturized face good
makeup comes with good skin care and
what not so been loving this now I hope
people don't judge me for this but I
haven't actually used these at all but
these are from Stila these are their
magnificent metals eye shadow glitter so
we've got three different shades once
again I haven't used them but I just
know I'm gonna love them because the
shades are incredible they are
so pretty and I feel like they're gonna
be perfect for festival season I'm just
gonna swatch them on my hand and then
show you guys up close so this is what
they look like up close they're so
beautiful we've got Sunset Cove ballet
baby Wow I think I almost just vomited
and then the last one we have is code
into the blur and I picked these up at
Mecca Maxima they're the next makeup
products I've been loving this is the
cover FX translucent powder in the shade
light translucent light I guess I did
say Laura Lee talked about this a lot
and I was like okay stop because I need
to try it out it's hot enough and I
finally did and it's really really nice
it's not too dark sets the under eye is
really nice and smoothly and now I think
I've got it on now so yeah nice smooth
under eye area which I'm living for so
the next thing I wanted to talk about
this is from a brand called big coyote
and this is their mineral highlighter I
currently have it on now it is so
blinding it is beyond a joke I have
never really played with mineral makeup
before to be honest but I've come across
these guys and literally I'm not even
kidding like it is just absolutely
blinding and you can add it up you can
like add more on and add more and more
and more on until you've got maximum
pigmentation and then even then again
when you wet your brush the amount of
pigment that you get is a jerk
oh I'm just gonna add more
stunning now the last makeup products
that I want to talk about today is the
Fenty beauty um matte lipstick these are
regular shade lipsticks and they are
just so incredibly pigmented and so
creamy and smooth but they're much at
the same time and they don't like a move
around your lips does that make any
sense so I'm gonna swatch these two
shades for you guys so this one is
called up to no good
sorry pigmented so creamy and smooth and
this shake here is called single like
even just one swipe that's all you need
and it's so incredibly pigmented I love
them now we're gonna move on to
something a little bit different than I
haven't really done before so I'm just
gonna talk about honor I've got one
piece of clothing clothing shoes that I
want to show you guys these are the
Louis Vuitton slides I guess I bought
them when I was in Melbourne I'm pretty
sure they're from their new season
absolutely stunning like I literally
wear them every single day and they also
match my duffel bag my passport color
and my wallet sorry when I have matching
stuff I'm like so next up we have a
fragrance now these are the Kim
kardashian-west fragrances I've got the
one called crystal gardenia and then
I've got crystal kodi neeya dude okay so
I don't actually wear these but I
sprayed them around my house was like a
refresher so instead of using like glenn
20 I just use days because I don't
really like to wear women's perfume as
much as I used to when I was younger so
I just used these to spray around the
house and spray them on my pillows and
it makes everything smell really really
nice and it stays because especially
this one this is food so it like stays
around for ages so yeah so I want to
kind of talk about youtubers each month
and like other youtubers that I've been
loving if that makes sense
so there's been two this month two not
four
see ya number one being a royal Christie
beauty now she does the best reviews and
I feel actually needs more recognition
here on YouTube because I can literally
just watch her videos on playlist on a
playlist on my computer all day and I'm
like doing other things and then I like
stop pause and watch for like an hour
and then I'll go off and do something
else and then I'll come back and watch
more of her or her reviews are just
sorry in depth like something that I
could never
because I just don't even think like
that but sewing depth and sarcoid I'll
be leaving her link down Pilar the
second youtuber that I've been loving is
Jackie ina Cheka Cheka Cheka Cheka Cheka
Cheka Cheka Cheka Cheka Cheka Cheka
Cheka Cheka i literally live when she
does that at the start of her videos
it's so like yes Jackie also does really
really really great reviews as well
really in-depth reviews and I will also
be leaving her link down below but I'm
sure you already know if Jackie Anna
because she's a literally phenomenal and
now the last thing that I want to talk
about so this month is my some of my
favorite songs now you guys requested
this if you don't want to know about my
favorite songs and feel free to click
off but I'm gonna show you some of my
jams that I've been loving this month if
you guys don't follow me on Spotify
already I'll leave the link down below
you can go check it out because I have a
million different playlists and normally
I have like what I do I have like a
month called January let my favorite
songs for January and like when a new
one comes out add it to it so it's like
mainstream like new that I liked
you know what I mean so it's wonderful
that fuller that
my buddy

up wanna let you give you talk get back
