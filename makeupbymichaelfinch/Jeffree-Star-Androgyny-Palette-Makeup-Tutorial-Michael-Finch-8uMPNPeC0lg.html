today I'm going to be doing a makeup
tutorial using the jeffree star
cosmetics and drogyny palette I just
wanted to say a huge thank you to
Jeffrey and his team for sending this to
me it's so amazing when you get to work
with brands that you love saying work
this video is not sponsored so first of
all I'm just going to be taking the it's
hard shape tape concealer and I'm going
to be using this as a base today for my
eye shadow and then just taking my damp
Beauty Blender and letting out all of
that concealer to make sure it is
seamless and then just setting it with a
little bit of translucent powder now
getting into the eye shadows I'm going
to be taking a charm and I'm going to be
putting that through my crease and when
I started blending this I was so happy
because it blends so well and the color
packs on really really well so I was
just tacking on color and blending that
all in my crease and I wanted this look
to kind of be a little bit blown out do
you know what I mean so it's not just
like everyday wearable well I mean it is
everyday wearable but you know I mean so
I'm just going to be taking the shade
fetish next and I'm putting that through
my crease and it's color is everything I
love it so I'm just letting that on my
outer V through my hooded little crease
there just so you can see the colors
when they're open and closed and then
I'm just going back into a little bit of
charm just to blend our fetish to make
sure it's all seamless then I'm taking
this shade called dominatrix which is
this beautiful brown shade and I'm going
to be putting that on my outer V and up
through my crease and a little bit on of
my lash line and this look is about
going back in and out with colors so I'm
going back in with a bit more fetish to
blend out dominatrix
and then I'm going in with a little bit
more charm to blend out fetish and
dominatrix do not I mean so it's just
about going back in there and adding
more color and oh the pigment is amazing
then I'm taking this show called deja vu
which is stunning and I'm just packing
up onto my lid I just spray my brush
with a little bit of six-plus just to
make the color a little bit more intense
like I do with all of my lid shades
I'm just popping it back on and then I'm
taking a little bit of frosting and just
putting that in the middle of my
eyeshadow just to lighten that area up a
little bit okay so moving on to eyeliner
I'm just taking a little bit of inglot
duraline with my AMC a gel liner and the
number 77 and I put a little bit of jira
line with it just because my English gel
liner it's super dry out if I always
leave a little because I'm such an idiot
so I put a little bit of Jura line and
it makes it a little bit more wet which
is great and it makes the product more
black in my opinion so there's the wing
for today now for my face I'm just going
to be moving on to the benefit
Porefessional matte rescue primer I love
this primary sort of bringing good and
there's my foundation we're going to be
using the RCM a color process foundation
this has easily become one of my new
favorite foundations very quickly I do
like this foundation the coverage is
amazing and makes your skin look
flawless and I need to get a few more
shades because I do need one for when I
am 10 so and then I'm just blending that
out with my and damn Beauty Blender you
guys know how we do and making sure it's
all seamless there are no brush strokes
or anything like that then of course it
would be rude not to use the Tarte
shaped tape to conceal today so I'm just
applying that to my chin Cupid's bow the
bridge of my nose my forehead and then
I'm blending that all out so it is
seamless and I was going to use a
different concealer today but then I was
like why fix it if it's not broke so I
used guitar shape tape surprise surprise
you shocked and then I'm just applying
that underneath my eyes to add a bit
down the side of my mouth to because I
just wanted more coverage everywhere I
loved it stuff so much I go through top
shaped a black eye I don't even know but
then I'm just blending that out with my
damp Beauty Blender making sure it is
all nice and blended and seamless this
touch okay blends asked so well by the
way start Riggin good and then I'm just
going to take some more ICMA translucent
powder and just bake underneath my eyes
to avoid any creasing although the
concealer doesn't really crease to be
honest and putting it right up
underneath my eye and bringing it down
in kind of like a triangle shape and
then for some reason I don't know why I
do this but I just ended up making my
whole entire I do it every time and I
don't know why
so powder foundation I'm going to be
using benefits hello flawless in the
shade honey and just setting the rest of
my foundation with that with a big
fluffy brush moving on to underneath my
eyes I'm just going to take a little bit
of charm and just pop that straight
underneath my lower lash line and kind
of blend it down a little bit just on
this little pencil brush right here and
then just adding more of charm just
going straight in there with that orange
color because it really makes my
greening bluey eyes pop and I love that
look and basically is doing exactly what
I did on top of my eye underneath my eye
- the lid color so I'm just taking a
little bit of fetish just on this little
brush here and then I'm just blending so
- out with a bit more charm to make sure
it's all nice and blended well stop
saying that say it too much then we're
taking dominatrix and just darkening up
underneath my lower lash line
- and blending that out with some more
fetish and then I'll be blending set a
sharp with some more charm you know just
going back in and out with colors that's
what it's all about
now we're just removing that under-eye
fake there to scare it exactly do not
need it anymore my waterline I'm just
going to be using be a market Jacobs
eyeliner forget what shade this was
called but I will leave it down below
all products we listed down below today
guys and for mascara it would be so rude
not to use my favorite to face a better
than sex on my top lashes so I'm just
applying a generous amount of that and
then I'm just going back in with a
little bit more charm just underneath my
lower lash line
after removing that under I baked and
then for my bottom lashes I'm just going
to be using me Mac extended play
gigablack lash
and some of you will ask why the thing
is bent it just lets you get in there a
lot easier you know I'm saying and then
I just suck on some Lilly ghalichi
lashes in the style Monaco
moving on to bronze up this is the Marc
Jacobs tantric bronzer it's that
good I'm literally obsessed as if bronze
are literally like this goes next to my
tart shape is that good I'm
obsessed with it so I'm just applying
that literally all over my face a
ridiculous amount of it because I love
it that much and yeah just conch not
contouring bronzing my cheeks my
forehead my jawline as well and
underneath my bottom lip to give the
appearance of a big lip not that I need
it okay thank team let's move on our
just a little bit down the bottom my
nose as well now to actually contour I'm
just going to take the Anastasio Beverly
Hills contour key because I have not
used this in a hot minute
it's been a very long time since I've
uses I've been stuck using benefit
fuller but I decided to whip this out
today because apply the fact not so I'm
just contouring my little life away here
with this little brush I always say I
can get some makeup by Jack use this to
contour with so and it's really good to
contour with I brush like this or it was
similar I don't really know but I like
it to contour pretty clear so I'm just
contouring my jawline and a little bit
down the sides and underneath the big
schnoz on my nose then we're moving on
to blush digits type captivating it is
so pigmented this blush I was like holy
 I did have to I did have to
blend a little bit off afterwards I did
put it on because it was just that
friggin intense but is a very beautiful
color I do love it and then just bracing
my face with a little bit of mac's fix+
before highlighting and will be rude not
to use Jeffrey's are highlighters so I'm
just going to be using ice-cold today
and just applying that to both of my
cheekbones obviously and yes packing on
that color oh it looks that good for the
back inject me injection
and just a little bit on my Cupid's bow
as well and the tip of my nose and my
nose bridge undeceiving a smaller brush
to put that on my nose because it gives
you more precision then I'm just baking
my contour a little bit and I left that
on for around probably 15 to 20 seconds
any longer than that and you're
you've got a white cast on your cheeks
the days so I left that on for 15-20
seconds as I just said and then brush it
straight off again otherwise it sucks
then for my lips today I'm going to be
taking the Makah lip liner and strip
down and just lining my lips with that I
tried not to either line them too much
because they're big enough at the moment
I just got them done the other day so
I'm just learning my lip and you know
how would you this Oh
strip John is the best Mac lip liner
ever
that's good and it would be rude not to
use a jeffree star lip sticks
undertaking celebrity skin in not the
liquid lipstick form I'm taking it in
the regular Stix form because I got this
off beauty list a few weeks ago and I've
been wanting to use it and they say I
love it a shot a shot and then just
touching up the edges with a little bit
more of the lip liner and then I'm just
setting my face with the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray and that's pretty
much it I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial if you did don't forget to give
it a massive thumbs up I love you guys
so much and I will see you all in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
