hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm going to be doing a Khloe
Kardashian look if you guys wanna know
how I went from this to this keep on
watching so today we're starting off
with the benefit Porefessional parabola
look what's already coming out of me
already coming out and I'm just going to
be putting that into my skin basically
my teaser an area where all my larger
sort of pores are my forehead and
basically just all over my face then I'm
just going to be brushing out my brows
with a disposable spoolie and now I'm
gonna be going in with this Melo
cosmetics dip brow pomade so the stuff
now this pomade is good I love it but
some people might not because it is a
very wet product but the more you sit it
on the back of your hand and play with
it and warm it up it gets thicker and
it's just so good because I'm one that
really likes those defined brows and
it's not dry at all it's very wet but it
can go dry the more you work with it and
that's what I really like about it and
so yeah I'm just putting that through my
brows and then I'm moving on to the
mellah cosmetics a light brown eyebrow
gel and just putting that all over my
hair just to make them a little bit more
defined and kind of putting them into
place for the day you know you know oh
my god now I'm using this concealer from
Maybelline called master conceal
honestly guys this is better than
Maybelline fit me concealer you need to
get this if you don't have it hashtag
not sponsored but honestly it is so so
good it is so good it is high coverage
it's hydrating yeah I just it's my new
favorite drugstore concealer like no
more fit me no more anti age rewind it's
all about the master conceal now now for
eyeshadow we're going to be going in
with Peach Smoothie I think it was from
makeup geek just putting that through
the crease now with this Chloe look she
doesn't really do that much on the eye
sometimes I saw this photo of her and
I'm just going to be doing something
quite neutral ish but still not because
I'm adding black anyway I'm just going
in with like four different makeup geek
shades I'll leave them all down below if
you guys I know the one that I'm using
the
are the really orange one is called
sidekick and it's one of my new
favorites it's kind of like a new
lighter orange of sort of cocoa bear but
now I know I'm going in with cocoa there
and I'm kind of just winging it out so
I'm kind of just flicking the brush out
to the corner of my eye and then I'm
just going back in with different
brushes and blending it all out as you
can see I have thrown in a little bit of
corrupt in there and then I'm just
blending that out again now just taking
a really little defined brush and I kind
of just made a little bit of a wing
happening up in there now I'm taking
another makeup geek shadow and just
putting that on my eyelid and I did not
like this color all that much so I do go
over in a second with another color
because I just wasn't loving it all that
much but I just feel like it looked too
yellow it wasn't gold I don't know
anyway moving on to the face and then
taking the Marc Jacobs remarkable in the
shade 54 this is too much my 10 as you
can see because if I was using a light
foundation it would not work Apple and
it would not look good at all it will
look completely off so I just have to
explain that because some people really
don't understand why I use such a dark
foundation so there we go
okay so I'm just blending that into my
skin using the morphe g36 brush and then
I'm just taking a little brush and going
over the top of my eyebrows just to
conceal them a little bit more because
this foundation is such high coverage
gobble now moving on to concealer I have
not used this in a hot minute this is
the Born This Way from true face in the
shade light neutral I think I'm just
putting that around the sides of my
mouth keep its bow chin nose bridge and
my forehead and I'm yet to do underneath
my eyes I just like to do the middle
part of it first and blend it out so
it's ready so then I can use my Beauty
Blender for my powder so when I blend
out the rest there's no powder all over
it doesn't go all gross you know what I
mean okay so I was putting a very
generous amount of concealer underneath
my eyes blending that out with the
Beauty Blender and then I'm going in
with the ICMA no color powder which I
need to get some more this because I'm
running short darlin
you know and then just let the rest of
my face it has a bit more of a warm sort
of feel to it I feel like it's a lot of
translucent it just has a bit more
coverage so I'm just using the hair
sponge to do that oh we're moving fast
here aren't we
to bronze my skin I'm using the Mac and
give me Sun bronze I just around my
jawline my cheekbones a bit down the
side of my nose a little bit under my
chin just to warm up the face before
going in and contouring so yeah what am
i doing and then I'll just contouring my
nose slightly I do have a full tutorial
on that if you guys are interested swim
just contouring on bring that up
underneath my eye socket thing if that's
the thing I don't do contouring a little
bit more I'm just using the other stuff
see our Beverly Hills contour kit in the
shade light and then I'm just baking
this side of my nose a little bit more
just to clean up that contour just so
it's not as intense and doesn't look as
fake now moving on to underneath the
eyes and basically just doing what I did
on top of the eyes underneath the eyes I
think I just took drew makeup geek
shades and just blended them into my
lower lash line but I will leave the
shades or those down below now to
highlight powder highlight my face i'm
using the Australis banana powder and
guys this is actually pretty good like a
it's had to grow me for a while
but you know it's good if you're looking
for a dupe for the banana powder this is
this is the one I really quite like it
just contouring my face now I'm just
using the Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour kit and trying to make a jawline
you know what I'm saying trying to make
a jawline just contouring around my
temples trying to make my face look
slimmer and then I'm just cleaning up my
contour with some more ice you may know
called a powder just with a Beauty
Blender and making my cheeks now for my
highlighter this is one of the most
beautiful highlighters I've ever used it
is called laura geller
gilded honey and oh my god
starting actually stunning yet i just
putting that on my Cupid's bow in my
cheeks and then taking a smaller brush
and doing my nose bridge so i keep it in
control so i just go all over my nose
and highlight the whole thing
and then i am putting it underneath
my brow bone as well and then to do some
blusher I am using the NARS orgasm just
on my cheeks
we've already moved on to my star I have
way fact this has gone quick today we
use that well I was going to stop
that voice over there and redo it but I
decided not to because you guys saw what
I use them all products will be listed
down below just popping on some lashes
and then adding some more mascara for my
lip liner and then using the Mac oh
I forget what it's called I'll leave it
down below as well guys sorry and I'm
just overloading my lips not to paint it
but I'm just doing it anyway and then
using Kylie cosmetics Dolce K liquid
lipstick all over my lips because it's
very fitting for this tutorial I feel
love a nude lip love a nude lip
absolutely love it and then for gloss
I'm just using the Anastasia Beverly
Hills don't quote me on it but I think
it's called butterscotch anyway guys
