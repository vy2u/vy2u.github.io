so today I'm going to be filming a Kylie
Jenner inspired book and what has
inspired me to do this is let me show
you let me show she finally got her
hands on the Kylie lip kit and this is
in Dolce K I don't know why I had to
look at that further when I got Dolce
Dolce so the whole look is gonna be
based around this and I thought why not
because like I've got the products I
should be doing a Kylie J inspired look
so basically I'm gonna do the eyes first
like they always do I was gonna take
some scotch tape I'm just going to be
putting that diagonally to the eye oh so
I've kind of just plopped it diagonally
to where my arches so I've just gone in
the shape of my arch and I'm just going
straight down and plopped it there just
under my bottom lash line here now as
you guys can already tell I've already
done my eyebrows and I use the UH
Nastasia pomade in chocolate and blonde
mix them together and then I've already
prepped my eyelids with the Mac Pro
Longwear concealer and nc15 today I'm
going to be using the cocoa blend
palette by Zoe bar and these are the
gorge colors and here it's probably my
favorite palette abar first of all I'm
just gonna dip into the color called
substitute for love which is this one
right here and I'm just going to be
spelunking that on the outer corner and
kind of upwards um so I'm gonna elongate
my eyes a little bit as well so I'm just
going to be blending that product kind
of halfway up to my brow bone just so
there's no harsh line at all now it's
going to be taking just color up here
and this is called bitter start this is
like a wide brow bone highlight that's
what I'm going to use it out today and
I'm just going to kind of pop that
underneath my brow now it's gonna be
taking the color freshly toasted which
is this darker Brown here and just going
straight in with my brush that had a
little hair poking out of it can you get
aft and I'm just going to pop that in
the outer V like not so it's noticeable
but just so there's a bit more like
definition or darkness in there just
about that much so it's not really
noticeable but it's just to find it a
little bit more now I'm going to be
going with a color beans are white which
is this black color here I still think
that's the weirdest name for and I show
beans are white but it's a black
eyeshadow that should have been called
beans away and this should have been
called better start up with that'll make
more sense I'm just going to go in with
a little bit of that just on the outer V
and bring it up into my crease the
tiniest little bit so just into that
outer crease there just
a little bit of silence um but I also
take my blending brush once again and
just blend that blackness out we don't
want it to be noticeable we just want it
to be there do you not I mean now what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to be
taking it that black color once again
and just starting to make a blended sort
of wing like not fully blended but like
so I'm sort of using eyeliner for this
we're just going to use the shadow so
I'm kind of bringing that up and don't
worry this is gonna get blended out as
well then I'm just gonna be picking up a
little bit more of that dark brown color
and just kind of blending that black out
sorry now it is time to take off the
tape oh that is so sharp now you might
have got a bit a fallout under your eyes
so just brush that away I'm just gonna
be taking the colour-pop shadow this is
in the color boy band it's like an
orange in copper sort of color and I was
gonna be Splunk in that all over my lid
just with my finger and had patrick star
says always blend your foiled shadows so
I'm just gonna blend that shadow out a
bit now for the fun part let's move on
to the rest of the face first of all I'm
going to be using Mac prep and prime fix
plus and just giving my face a few
squirts of that you know just because I
want it to be quiet
um I want to be quite Julie today but I
don't know if I can achieve that look
because I put so much foundation on and
nothing ever shines through for me next
I'm just going to be taking Mac strobe
cream now for my foundation today I'm
gonna be using the Too Faced Born This
Way Foundation now I've had this for so
long I think I said in a video that I
don't like it but I've joined shinies
makeup the other night and I used it and
I fell in love with it once again I just
think I didn't use a properly last time
like I used it yesterday and I used to
shitload over on myself and I feel like
it's just so hard to get off which is
what you want in a foundation so I'm
going to be using this and I am gonna be
mixing with a bit of benefits hello
flawless oxygen we're in the colored
nutmeg whoa just because I am a little
bit tear at the moment and I just want
it to match up so I was gonna be taking
my little trusty spatula here I'm just
going to be mixing those before I do
foundation I'm just going to put some at
benefit the professional Matt rescue
primer this is their new primer so it's
kind of like a gel serum starts very
different from the professional the
professional is more
of a thick sort of consistency whereas I
this is a bit more like loose and
liquidated it backs away
should I just make it up put that shit
in your dictionary so I've got my
foundation here and I'm just going to go
straight in with my Beauty Blender just
the black one obviously what the fuck
and I'm just going to start putting that
all over my face now before I go any
further I'm just going to conceal the
tops of my brows just with the
foundation color that I'm using today
next I'm just going to taking the
Maybelline age rewind concealer in the
color light pale and I'm not going to be
using as much as it affected last time
because I went I think went a little bit
overboard
a little bit more mac fix+ on my beauty
blender give that a bit of a squeeze and
then just blend your life away now I'm
just going to be using Chanel tan de
Soleil and I'm just kind of kind of put
that on the outer areas of my face it
doesn't make much difference but it
still makes a bit of a difference once
again I'm just going to be blending that
tournesol a all the way out just before
I bake I'm going to be taking the
benefit Watts up highlighter and kind of
just popping that on my cheekbone area
I'm kind of just going to bring it down
actually you have to blend this out I'm
gonna use the makeup geek Foundation
stippling brush I haven't really used
this what's up like I don't really use
liquid highlighters I just want to see
how they go with my skin just because I
do put a lot of product on there if
don't I don't know if it's ever worth
doing but it's given me a nice little
glow I don't know if you can see that
but I can just before I forget I'm just
going to taking my EOS lip-balm and just
putting some of that on just to like get
ready for the liquid lipstick instead of
baking my under eyes I'm just going to
try something different
like I just feel like being different
and that's what I'm gonna be so I just
set my under eyes I'm going to take the
UH Nastase art what does it contour kit
had a blank there and the yellow shade
in there and I'm just going to Pat that
on underneath my eyes just in patting
motions you can kind of see the glow
underneath that is so cool sorry I'm
really excited that's never happened
before I don't know how my under-eye
creases are going to go but we'll soon
find out and I can face chin that shit
anyway I mean seriously just over the
areas where I've highlighted that's
where I'm going to be put into yellow
anastacio powder now to set the rest of
my face I'm just gonna be using my crew
ds1 powder and this weird brush like
down on eBay for like $2 and I'm just
going to set the rest of my face but
there's I don't know how that's going to
work first time using a bubble see so
I'm not going to be going on the areas
where I've set with the yellow banana
powder I'm just going to avoid that
completely but you obviously need to set
the rescue foundation if you wanted to
last
now she bronze up my face I'm just going
to be using the Mac
give me some bronzer new fave brands are
obsessed just on my benefit contouring
bronzing brush just waking up and I'm
just going to be popping that I'm not
going to do too much of a contour today
I just want it to be quite light and I
was going to bring it down onto my neck
here I would say jawline but I don't
have one now to contour the rest of my
face I'm just gonna be using the other
stars to your kit obviously and I'm
gonna be taking this color here and it's
color here and I'm taking that on my
zoeva one to seven luxe sheer cheek
brush best contour brush ever
yeah for my highlighter so now we're
taking the other stars here Kim I'm
going to be using this highlighter in
here because Olivia was using it the
other night so shout out to Olivia if
you're watching which you fucking better
be watching and I'm going to try
highlighting with that because her
Highlander looked so so good so I only
see how it goes
there actually does look really really
nice now for blush I'm going to be
taking a bit of this orange and a bit of
this pink and just popping that on the
apples just really lightly because these
are from makeup geek and they're really
really pigmented I feel like my
highlight needs to just be that a little
bit stronger so I'm gonna be taking the
mary lou manizer by the balm putting a
tiny bit more light over the top now I'm
sorry gonna finish off the under-eye
area so I'm just gonna be taking that
darker brown color the under eye area is
so easy by the way then I'm just going
to blend that down a little bit just
with any fluffy friend blending brush
back in with the black color here I'm
just gonna be joining up my lashline so
just do a little tiny light your so it
joins that up that is all that I should
have done that's how simple it is now I
never curl my lashes but I'm gonna curl
them today using this fancy err eyelash
curler from make up weapons Patrick
Starr would say I'm gonna curl my lashes
up to Jesus ooh
now for top mascara like for my top
lashes I'm going to be using the Mac
extended play gigablack lash mascara for
my lashes today I'm going to be using
the Lilly ghalichi lashes in the style
Paris
so bottom lashes I just decided scar
with my Mac extended play now actually
not going to be using the lipliner just
because I don't like lip liners with
liquid lipsticks I'm not go to applying
lip liner I'd rather just do a liquid
lipstick so this is the finished look I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
did give it a thumbs up and I'll see you
all in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
