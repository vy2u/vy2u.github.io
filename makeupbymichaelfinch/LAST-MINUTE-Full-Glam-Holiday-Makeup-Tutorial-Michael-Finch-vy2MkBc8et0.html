I'm just gonna bring you guys a quick
full glim a last-minute holiday makeup
first of all I'm just gonna prep my face
with a bit of fix+
and then I'm going straight in with the
top shape tape on my eyes using as a
base and just blending that out with a
sponge and then I'm just setting that
with a bit of translucent powder to make
sure it does not move now first thing
we're going in with his Peach Smoothie
by makeup geek and I'm just putting that
throughout my crease chooses my
transition shade so everything blends
nicely then I'm just gonna be going in
with a bit of tan lines and Coco bear
and a bit of frappe true so I kind of
just tipped into all three of them I'll
leave those shades down below if you
guys want to hear them again and I'm
just putting them throughout my crease
and just kind of packing on the color
blending it out as I go to make sure
that there is no harsh lines at all
I love blending it so good now I'm just
taking the little metics
a glitter glue which I spilt all over my
floor in the end anyway and I'm just
putting that all across my eyelid area
as you can see and then I'll just be
going straight in with it that glitter
over the top oh so pretty look at that
absolutely stunning now for my wing
today I'm just gonna be using the
Maybelline studio gel liner and just
doing a bit of a wing with that and then
just bringing it back down again
and then she's all done she's ready to
go she's ready to go to the party she's
done okay so once your wings are done
I'm just gonna put a bit of Too Faced
better than dick mascara over the top
and for my lashes I'm gonna be using
these lashes from Holy Grail cosmetics
in the style Queen B and just sticking
them on oh you struggling a bit today
does she hate it when your lashes do
that like they stick to your tweezers
because there's a bit of excess glue on
them anyway moving on to the face I'm
now taking the alloyed girl primer and
just rubbing that all into my face to
make sure everything is nice and smooth
now going in with one of my new favorite
drugstore foundations this is the Milani
perfecting conceal foundation and just
putting that all across my face and then
blending it out and then I'll be going
straight over the top of all of that
with the Beauty Blender to make sure
there is no harsh lines because I cannot
live without my Beauty Blender it is my
life to blend a concealer to blend that
absolutely everything I love it and by
the way if I sound a bit sick well
that's probably because like it because
I am hayfever what's what can you do
about it so I'm just blending that out
with my Beauty Blender making sure there
are no hashi's and then just going in
with a bit as the Make Up For Ever HD

t-zone area blending that out before I
drew my eyes because I like to bake my
eyes instantly so I'm just taking a
Genet very generous amount of concealer

again just blending that out with the
Buki well it's on the Beauty Blender
