channel so today I'm just going to be
doing a lazy day makeup routine so
pretty much I'm just gonna be showing
you guys what my lazy day makeup routine
is what I need to go somewhere but I
need to look kind of ok everything I'm
using today is a drugstore slash
affordable I've just got really like
affordable products here
which is good because I know you guys
like that also I love wearing drugstore
products on just like a lazy day as well
because then I don't have to waste my
not waste but like I don't have to use
my high-end makeup so drugstore items
are really good to have in your kits so
I'm just gonna go ahead and get straight
into it
so starting off I'm gonna be taking the
L'Oreal Lumi magique based primer I
really like this one because it's glowy
you're just getting a really nice glow
and it also perhaps the skin ready for
foundation and this is like a really
quick like lazy day makeup meaning like
there's not really much effort being put
into it but you want to look like you've
put effort in do you know what I mean
honestly this primer smells like a Lube
it smells like fucking Lube that's not a
bad thing but Oh anyway putting out all
over my skin
next I'm gonna be taking the maybelline
baby skin instant pore eraser and I'm
just gonna be putting this in my t-zone
area this kind of just like feels like
the large pores that you have on your
face if you have any if you don't then
you're a very lucky person I'm telling
you're not right now but I'm just gonna
put this all into my t-zone mainly under
my eyes and those little creases my nose
above my lip around my mouth and yeah
just fills them up nicely before I go
any further I'm just gonna pop a little
bit of chapstick on my lips just to get
them ready for what ever lip product I'm
gonna be using today for my foundation
today I'm gonna be using the infallible
pro Glory by L'Oreal this is in the
shade 2:01 classic ivory what's been
happening guys I haven't really sat down
and chatted to y'all in a while
I hope you'll join super super well I've
been doing good I've been traveling
around a little bit you know here and
there in Sydney and Melbourne and
whatnot I went to the Bondi stands
launched their new Sun care the other
day and we had like a little meet up at
coogee beach in Sydney it was so good
thank you to everyone who came everyone
was so nice and sweet we all had a lot
of fun that day and that night the party
was litter Bondi Stan's knows how to
throw a lit as fuck party so that was
really good as well all right now I'm
sewing taking my Beauty Blender and take
a little bit more of that actually a lot
of that foundation on my sponge and I'm
just going to learn this all into my
skin and get everything nice and covered
so we have a nice canvas for everything
to lie on top of by the way if you guys
didn't know I'm having master classes
around Australia I'm doing like like a
little tour this isn't like super full
coverage but like it shows like you put
a little bit of effort into you know
what I mean so the coverage is there but
I'm just choosing not to build it all
the way up today because we just want
something blended like natural neutral
not natural because I'm in no way shape
or form natural at all and we all know
that that's a fact now for my concealer
today I'm gonna be going in with the
master concealer from Maybelline this is
in the shade 20 light
I discovered this product such a long
time ago and honestly I never really
reached for it um I don't know why
because it's literally one of the best
drugstore concealers I've ever used
I'm pretty sure I don't reach for it as
much because it's not as light as I
would like it to be but it still
conceals the bags and highlights the
whole area which is right because that's
what we're wanting so I'm just gonna
squirt some of that onto the back of my
hand and I'm just gonna pop it under my
eyes oh sorry my nose and just kind of
drag it all over my nose my chin Cupid's
bar and around my mouth and obviously
just a little bit on the forehead area
huh going straight back in with my
Beauty Blender just gonna blend all of
this out in there all bananas okay like
this look I'm doing right now is
completely opposite to something that I
normally do that's because this is a
lazy day makeup routine so it needs to
be
quick and it just needs to be you know
on-the-go sort of thing which is exactly
what I'm going to do now the next
product I'm going to be taking is the
Maybelline fit me finishing powder this
is in the shade fair Claire
I actually pick this up when I was in
America if you been watching me for a
while you know I am literally obsessed
with this it is topping all of my
powders lately which is so good because
it's Maybelline and it's drugstore
hopefully this comes out in Australia
soon I have not seen this in stores in
Australia if you know when it's coming
out leave me a comment down below
because I do need to get some more but
if you're in America this is very
popular in America at the moment so I'm
just going to tip a little bit of this
into the lid and then I'm just going to
quickly do a little slight baking under
the eyes okay my air conditioner
seriously sounds like a water fountain
like shut the fuck off okay so now saw
the rest of my face I'm just going to
take the Australia's fresh and flawless
powder this in the shade light beige and
I'm just gonna dust this all over my
skin just so I set all my foundation in
place and it does not move for the whole
day and I'm also just gonna dust off
that baked under my eyes as well I'm
here now for a little bit of bronzing
and contouring I'm just gonna be taking
the colour-pop contour and highlight
palette I'm gonna be taking this shade
right here it's gonna take a little bit
of that on my brush I'm actually not
gonna use that second I think it's gonna
be a little bit too orange for my
skintone at the moment cuz I don't have
much tan on so I'm just gonna go in with
my NYC a bronzer
instead I'm actually gonna go into my
Chloe Morello a Revlon sculpting
highlight contour kit and I'm gonna be
taking this shade here just because
nothing's working out for me today
because that's my whole entire life
okay so now that I have like a really
light Cointreau R / bronze to my skin
we're looking pretty good and you can
still see all my freckles on my forehead
which is insane because normally I cover
them all up now I'm just gonna be taking
this palette here from the balm this is
the nude beach palette and I'm just
gonna take let's just okay there goes
the brush I'm just going to take this
orange shade out of the palette and I'm
just gonna do this as like a wash of
color through my crease because
everything else is like so not dramatic
so I want something to be like a little
bit I want my eyes to really pop do you
know I mean I was just so fucking
pigmented I did not expect this well so
I'm just washing at this color called
butter bird or Dash's birdie bodacious I
don't know just running that through my
crease just feel like a wash of color
I'm also just gonna take a little bit of
that iron shed and just pop it
underneath my lash line don't swim take
this shade cold built out of the same
palette I'm just gonna pop that on my
lid for a little bit of shimmer
wow that's pigmented I didn't even need
to use fix boss now it's gonna take a
little bit of shake called brilliant up
in this corner here and I'm just gonna
pop it under my brow bar the elevate of
the brow bone ever so slightly now for
my brows I'm just gonna be taking the
essence make me brow eyebrow gel mascara
and I'm just gonna slightly pop that
through my eyebrows this will just give
like a more room to look of the whole
brows situation just completely natural
I mean no one's got naturally gold
eyelids and an orange crease but you
know it's not like you put a little bit
of effort in now for my mascara I'm just
gonna be taking the I love extreme
essence of crazy volume mascara on
now for a little bit of color I'm just
going to be taking the wet and wild
blush in the shade mallow wine just to
add a little bit of flushed color to my
cheeks I'm looking quite washed out at
the my bar now for my highlighter I'm
just gonna be taking the essence pure
nude highlighter this is in the shade B
my highlight and I'll actually just
scrape the top layer off because y'all
came to me and said that if you scrape
the top layer off it works but I still
haven't found any of my highlighter
brushes yet they're all fucking still
long it's gonna run a little bit of that
under my brow bone as well on my inner
corners chipping my nose nose bridge and
I'm just gonna put it all up on my
forehead because it is quite a light
well I don't you don't need to be too
scarce of where you put on how much you
use because it is quite like feel like
it's not bad I really like it and for
the price I think it was like $7 not
even I bought it when I was in America I
bought it in Ulta
okay I'm pretty nothing and now I'm
gonna be popping on a little bit of the
astrologer Bosses Demi matte lip cream
this is in the shade and power I'm just
gonna pop a little bit of this on and
now to set my face in place I'm just
gonna be taking the Australis make up
finishing spritz Matt sets makeup for
all-day wear and I haven't even tried
this yet to be honest
