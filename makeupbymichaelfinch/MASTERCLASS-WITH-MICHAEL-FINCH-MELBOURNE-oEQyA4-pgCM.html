and had like five computers going when
the tickets came Athens no I like him
because he's funny he started out there
he has good energy
Armel doesn't really care what like
anyone thinks about him so he just like
keeps on going he's like my favorite
youtuber of like all time and I'm
literally shaking okay good news cool
cool
hi my favorite one
hey guys thank you so much for coming
day
okay guys I'm gonna take need multi
beauties
because he's doing such an amazing event
we had to call me here's the biggest fan
I just as a guy and being into makeup I
really related to him just cause like I
will say bling I've been I was bullied
or very primary school high school and
like it's good to have some way you can
relate to this is like such an aspiring
artist he started laying one of other
people just start neutral he's the
reason why I should do get into fight
maybe easy tutorial shows you everything
just nice I rely we can look the bronze
and like the oranges I love that the one
turns on my favorite but I love it when
he great exotic and he does all
different colors that's the best you
guys got anybody
I'm civilian 500 I shouldn't 24/7 and
why not feed on personal it's being a
boss so far and thank you for giving
boys confidence to wear makeup
so as an awesome experience to be able
to talk to Michael and ask me questions
about why he was doing things rather
than just watching behind a 12-minute
video it makes it a more real experience
rather than through YouTube well I
actually met her on a Facebook group and
then when I arrived I will submit this
girl and then she was in front of us in
the line so we all came together and I
thought well you know we all have the
same love for Michael so why not just
bring that love together and like now
we've like made friends with each other
and I was really worried coming by
myself she's like I'm not gonna know
anyone but then when he posted his last
video when he was talking about the
goody bags he's like you know there's
gonna be keeps people coming alone to
all be fine
oh saying it like in real time Bethany
was very helpful
but maybe the cut phrase I struggled for
imagine saying it up and close and like
step by step was perfect guys sir I just
finished up on my first master class in
Melbourne it was so much fun thank you
all so much for coming pretty much what
happened today was we did one first look
which is like a natural sort of look and
then everybody had some food all the
events are located and then we did a
whole clan look and then we did like
warm tones like big nice wings everyone
who came up to me after did you have fun
to do let's I mean that all said yes so
that's a really really positive I hope
you all learned some amazing little tips
and tricks and I had such a really good
time meeting you guys I've got a lot of
people watching me right now I can't
climb a little bit Sutter II so just we
can deal with that yeah everyone turn
around come on we don't have to cut a
fight out because it's funny
