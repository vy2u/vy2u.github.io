channel so today I'm super excited
because I'm going to be testing out the
morphe 35o 2 palette this is the second
palette of the morphe 35o that morphe
brushes has comment out with and I'm so
excited because apparently the formulas
changed and it's really really good so
without any further ado let's get
straight into this video I'm so beyond
excited and just letting you guys I know
this video is not sponsored okay cool
let's go sorry I've already done my face
makeup and my face makeup done without
my eyes looks are crazy I feel like I
look insane first color sorry this is
gonna be like a warm brown sort of look
and I know you guys probably sick of
that but I mean what else am I meant to
do with this palette and I really want
to review it sir I want to do something
different is that does that make sense
when I'm talking about warm tones hold
on mob boss mob a thousand ha nose okay
so first of one we're gonna get into
this shade right here this is a good
decision or a bad decision hot off today
I'm gonna be using this as my transition
color wow this is
sorry different but it's sorry pigmented
Wow okay now to blend out that shade I'm
just gonna take this shade right here
actually I'm gonna take this one up in
the corner here because we do need a bit
of a brown just to blend this color
after not I'm saying so I'm gonna put
that above that shade which I should
have done first but I didn't because I
just wanted to go straight in with this
color okay guys so I'll kind of just
packed on this like almost neon color I
know it looks crazy right now but don't
worry I'm going to cover a majority of
it I'm just kind of using it as like a
base for all my shades I'm then gonna
dip into like this terracotta like sort
of shade here and I'm gonna pop that in
my outer V and what I'm gonna do is I'm
just gonna use this to like completely
deepen up my crease guys I'm actually
gonna turn this tutorial into like a
voiceover right now because I really
just want to focus and play with the
colors so yeah
voiceover starts now but I will come
back at the end of the video and let you
guys know what my final thoughts on the
palette
okay sir voice service starts here I'm
just gonna be taking I'm not sure which
I'm pretty sure this is like a
terracotta shade and I'm just gonna run
that through my crease just to kind of D
up there it is just to kind of deepen a
pop and then I'm hacking more on with a
more denser brush trying to really get
that color in there I feel like these
colors are very buildable but at the
same time if you blend too much you're
gonna end up letting the color away it's
kind of like with the black eye shadow
I'm going into black now it's a really
very pigmented black and I love that
because people into black eye shadows
kind of hard to find some days these
days I feel like I should have companies
are really picking up their game with
everything but back in the box
we were literally only all stuck with a
makeup geek corrupt and that wasn't the
best anyway so I'm dragging that up
through my crease and it might look a
little crazy right at the moment but I
am gonna blend it out afterwards and I
am gonna be doing like a little cut
crease so it's all going to make sense
very soon so I'm just blending away with
that and just going straight up on in
there it does look really crazy doesn't
it but I bought the dark color way in
and made it really dark just because my
cut crease will look better when it is
done then I'm just trying to blend out
that black not too much otherwise it
will blend away but see I'm just going
in and adding some more now and making
it super pigmented because I love a
really good super pigmented black I did
learn the other day I was talking to Jo
and she was doing my makeup and she
pretty much just said that if you leave
a black eyeshadow on and just Pat it and
not blend it just like sit on there at
the end when you are done everything it
just looks sorry pigmented and so good
which it does it works so always blend
out your black but then always pack more
on anyway sorry now back on top trim
them back on look I can't even
talk this is why I don't do a voice
sorry there's Han I'm taking the AMC gel
liner from Inglot I'll leave what number
it is down below because I completely
forget and I'm just cutting at my crease
might as well get a pair of
scissors and start cutting away at my
skin because that's what it sounds like
doesn't it but I'm just drawing a line
and making a new lid crease
I guess just with these little tiny
small brush just trying to get it really
precise and now the reason why it's so
dark on it you know corn eyes because it
just looks better and this is more
vibrant and
and what I do is I take my brush and I
wipe it off on my hand and then just
kind of blend that gel liner into the
out of B and I'll go back in afterwards
and touch setup which you'll see soon
then I'm gonna be taking this gold shade
from the morphe palette there we go and
I'm just gonna pack that bull over the
lid I did spray my brush quite a bit
with the fix+ to really make it
pigmented and get it right up against
that line so it wasn't just like calling
off or anything like that it was all
sticking there touching it up as you can
see right now so I like it I feel like
that looks pretty cool what do you guys
think I like it um what's next voice
wavers are so annoying um oh
there we go I'm taking the black
eyeshadow and just kind of blending that
into like a dog all sort of lid and just
kind of making a nice transition and it
works really well then I'm just gonna be
doing exactly what I did on top of my
eye underneath my eye so I'm just taking
that really vibrant neon orange shade
just on a small blender brush and kind
of just focusing up right underneath my
eye and then I great union with this
brush and kind of blend it out a little
bit more it's a bit more fluffy ah it's
the shattuck so like crease brush I
think I'm not sure but it's really good
I love using em for things like this and
then I'm just going back in and adding
some more color because I did lose a bit
when I blend it away and just adding
more on hon adding more on hum drop the
fog on hand then I'm just taking the
zoeva gel eyeliner and just popping that
into my waterline because I'm gonna
smoke that down with some black eye
shadow any second now there we go I'm
just going in with some black eyeshadow
and smoking that down a little bit so
it's you know like full glam intense
exactly what I love hon yeah just go and
you know just cleaning up that little
bit there and yeah oh then I just take
some more of the black shadow and I just
pop it into my lash line just so my
lashes blend away I didn't really want
to do eyeliner just because simply to be
honest couldn't be so I just went
in with the black eye shadow and then
I'm using the lush paradise from L'Oreal
for my top and my bottom lashes today
and then I went straight in with the
Lilly ghalichi Miami lashes
yes okay guys so this is the completed
look my final thoughts on this palette
is it speaks for itself
I'm all but ceci black I shudder
is everything these colors us are good
and sorry pigmented I feel like they've
really upgraded their formula since 3/5
are I'm so impressed with this palette
this is going to be one of my new go-to
palette so I actually prefer this
palette or even the Jacqueline Hill
palette is that saying something or is
that too far however I really hope you
guys did enjoy this tutorial if you guys
want to see more palette reviews and
stuff like this or if you guys want to
say talk throughs or if you want to see
voiceovers I kind of like doing
voiceovers I haven't done a voiceover
and probably lack a year I feel like 100
voiceovers I can just chill out my I can
put my music on and just like you know
relax and just go with the floor and
it's not as rushed so yeah I am obsessed
with this whole entire look I love the
gold on the eyelid the English eyeliner
did really help the whole cut crease
situation and I've got going on here but
the black the lashes just like
everything anyway I really hope you guys
did enjoy this video unfortunately I do
not have a more fetus category but there
are a lot out there so yeah I love you
guys so much and I will see you all in
my next video see y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
