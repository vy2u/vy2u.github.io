one because you got spines there a lot
one because you don't allow twine but oh
open a can of sprite zero and it spreads
very long because you're trying to watch
your weight a lot long
it doesn't make a difference on bond
because writing a fuckload a cough lon
best and worst experiences when meeting
all the makeup artists I haven't
actually had a bad experience
everyone seems pretty nice to me um
there is just like one specific youtuber
that I actually cannot fucking stand I
cannot deal with this person shit the
fact that like they're just constantly
wanting to start drama with everyone on
earth like no just stop delete all your
social medias because you're fucking
annoying
um this person gets called out all the
fucking time but they just keep going do
you know what I mean like stop you're an
idiot you look like a fucking eejit
suppose you don't know Egypt is actually
idiot in New Zealand language I think I
think my aunt you told me that one she
said call me an AJ kind of sounds like
Egypt love that that tastes sour good
love a good dumpling dumpling Kendall
okay guys I'm gonna dig in today's
chicken skewers because I love a bit of
chicken chickens my favorite me in the
world is that bad no I love chicken shot
to an ASMR video could you imagine with
my fucking lip gone what's your most
embarrassing moment Wow
I don't have a merged embarrassing
moment like all together but there is
something that happened a while ago
which was really embarrassing on my
behalf and my friend didn't even know
that happened until I told him sorry hey
guys sorry at the time I was seeing this
guy and me and all my friends went out
clubbing he didn't come out clubbing and
when we went back to my house and oh we
came back to my house and um my friend
who's a guy studying my bed also and I
woke up during the night and because I
was like kind of so drunk and like I
don't know I was just a mess I thought
my friend was the guy that I was seeing
anyway
he was like like spooning me pretty much
I didn't even realize this was happening
yeah he was like spooning me and I
literally thought it was the guy that I
was saying so my friend was like lying
there and I was like I was like this on
his head I was like like this and then
he put his hand on my face like this and
then like it kept kind of going and then
I realized and I clicked that that was
not who I thought it was and it was so
fucking awkward I literally just put the
jr. over my head turn the other way and
was just like fuck and I literally
already told him like a few weeks ago
that I happened and he was like are you
serious I might be guys sorry about it
like a bad habit that's not like
embarrassing it's just kind of awkward
but at the time I was like fuck fuck me
up
Yani alluro what the fuck is going on yo
Laurel I still don't know what the fuck
that is
conspiracies oh my god everyone must
want old Americans crazy I'll talk about
it for a little bit just a little just
going long the situation that I want to
talk about I know people have died in
you know some people have died in so
please don't be offended when I talk
about this um nothing of what I say is a
hundred percent true but a lot of the
evidence does come together and it does
make a lot of sense and this little
brain here sorry the conspiracy that is
my favorite is 9/11 9/11 I'm sure all of
you know what it is if you don't just
google it I truly believe like 90% of
America does as study shard that that
was a full-on inside job it was a for an
inside job and even george w bush
slipped up one time and almost said
conspiracy like insert footage here
honest mo can instead the footage cuz i
darmani use someone else's footage but
saying that if you got much shined
Olson's conspiracy doing videos
hey is an absolute legend I love it okay
I'm just gonna go off the topic of
conspiracies for a second I literally
love Shane Dawson he is like my number
one favorite youtuber I would marry him
I would lick his fate if he asked me to
lick his fucking I would if he asked me
to I hey I gag a lot I don't have out
like I mean like
with something hmm but like if something
like if buddy's taking a shit like I'll
just gag you not I mean
but if Shane Dawson vomited and asked me
to clean it up I wouldn't gag I would
just clean it up is that too fucked up I
don't really care that's how much I love
him like I he's so entertaining he's a
beautiful person I mean I haven't met
him but like you can just tell
super genuine I would marry him and I
would suck the shit out of him like he's
that hot back to and 9/11 it was an
inside job and I fucking know it is it's
just like crazy because we are told oh
my god if I get into this I'm not gonna
stop we are told what we want to hear
like the media and whatnot like I was in
Harvey Norman the other day and the
checkout chick there was actually
telling me I don't know how we got you
know talking about it
but she was telling me that a new law
has just come in where TV and news
presenters if they don't say what
they're told to say they can go to jail
whether that's true or not so for
example if you know the media comes to
them and is just like you know you need
to say this this this and this and if I
don't want to say it and they said
something else but they'll go to jail
like how fucked up is that like we're
literally told what we want to hear the
government can just like hide so much
from us like there's just so much proof
on the internet that like we're being
lied to
okay we're being lied to and like I keep
it extremely open mind when it come I
don't even watch the fucking news I do
not watch the news because for example I
don't know if this sounds really fucked
up but like has anyone heard of weather
manipulation like the Russians started
doing that in the 1980s so weather
manipulation is where they make storm or
they make an earthquake or they make a
tornado or they make a tsunami like they
can literally do anything they want with
the right chemicals in the sky crazy
right it's absolutely crazy so if they
want to fucking put a tsunami on China
then they fucking will like they do
whatever I don't this is gonna sound
really crazy but like this is what I
mean like we're told what we want to
hear like natural disaster natural like
I think a lot of it is man-made disaster
to be honest like as fucked up as that
sounds that's what I think that's my
opinion if you guys want me to talk more
about conspiracy theories where I know
what I'm talking about and I'm on the
topic of conspiracies I can really get
into it if you guys man our video on
conspiracies and my thoughts
Valeri hey I'm gonna open up this white
thing and there's paper stuck to the
bottom of it oh oh it's a pork bun
fuck me nothing I'll just talk about
manage the questions is the video that I
uploaded was Shaunie a few weeks ago
where we talked about a fight and when I
took the comments like two hours later
everyone was just like Shaunie such a
bitch blah blah blah I was like I hey
you've got to understand the true signs
of the stories here like she was clearly
upset I was being a con I apologize for
being a con she didn't need to apologize
to me necessarily because she didn't do
anything wrong do you know what I mean
like I know how upset she was and we've
spoken about off-camera as well and sort
it all out but like it was just like
probably wasn't the best thing to
discuss on camera for the first time
which is what we did
but yeah meme Shaunie never fight like
that was our one after knowing her for
like two or three years three years
almost now about three years now I think
that's the only fight we've had so yeah
I just wanted to clear that up don't
send Shaunie anyway because she did
nothing wrong I was the one that did
everything wrong by the way it's Sunday
at the moment love a good Sunday I'm not
hungry well which is absolutely
incredible and I didn't go that last
night I'm really over going out I'm just
like I leave early and I get so bored
I'm just like I'm drunk like I'm bored
now I don't want to get more drunk and
just like be and that's like I always
used to be so I just leave ugly
everyone's like aah
bill you whore and I'm like look I just
wanted our home watching movie get some
McDonald's on the way and that's exactly
what I do
fuck Michael you're such a pig I know
I'm just filming a mukbang lock on
oh you fuck with wrong
oh yeah hmm let's start hovering on
Hospital ticking the Millers stuff I
wrote okay now before I end this video I
want to talk about a few more things
number one a lot of people have been
asking me to talk about my insecurities
insecurities should be honest probably
mine ours it's quite large and in charge
sorry it's my body I'm not really
insecure about it anymore do you know
what I mean if I'm really insecure about
anything that's probably my anxiety
because it stops me from going and doing
things like I would rather stay home
than go out or I would rather just stay
home and go anywhere like I'm always
home always hard I guess it's not like
an insecurity that's just like a mental
thing but how do I go , I don't leave
the house you know what I did try and
lose weight for a while there and I did
and I don't need as bad as I used to but
okay an attorney in as bad as I used to
however I'm just living in the moment do
you know what I mean like I'm not gonna
worry about being on track everyday
about losing weight I'm not gonna like I
just want to live in the moment and just
take it day-by-day do you know what I
mean like you literally like I'm sorry
like I know it's lame but Yolo is
actually so true like you do only live
once like we're put on this earth for a
reason I guess and like my time here
while I'm on this earth I want to make a
difference somehow in the world if I can
make someone smile that's fantastic if I
can inspire someone that's fantastic if
I can help someone through a struggle
they're going through that's fantastic
that is my life goal achieved do you
