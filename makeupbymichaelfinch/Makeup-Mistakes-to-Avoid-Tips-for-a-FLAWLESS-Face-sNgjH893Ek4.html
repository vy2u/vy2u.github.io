today I'm going to be showing you all
these makeup do's and don'ts / makeup
takes to avoid now as you can obviously
tell you can see what side is the avoid
side and you can see the do science or
the do's and the don'ts a little
disclaimer that I just wanted to say is
that I don't want to offend anyone in
this video if you do do stuff on this
but and that works to you that's awesome
and happy for you I'm not telling you
what to do I'm not saying don't do this
don't do that these are just my tips and
tricks that I was in over the years so
if you do any it is please don't be
offended because I'm happy to work for
you at the end of the day is makeup and
it does white box so anyway without any
further ado let's get straight into
these tips and tricks I really hope you
guys enjoy this video if you are new
here and don't forget to subscribe to
keep up with all my future videos and
let's get into it okay starting off with
it the first thing is priming knife
select primer it's very important not
that I think it keeps your makeup on and
improves the longevity of it throughout
the day but makeup application it
definitely works when you put your
foundation on over primer it's more
smooth it doesn't go patchy and I still
like it blends a lot better I've tested
this myself and I feel like it really
does work as they say not to prime is a
crime okay so moving on to the second
thing is eyebrows now I'd rather very
personal so I'm not going to tell you
what to do this whole videos not telling
anyone what to do it's just little tips
and tricks that I have learned over the
years so what I don't like doing is
blocking the front of my eyebrows off
with a square if that makes sense can
you see what I mean like what I like to
do is I just go through my brow with the
pomade that I'm using and I just go over
the top draw a line and blend it
together now instead of blocking it off
at the front of the eyebrow like I did
on the other one what I like to do is
just grab a spoolie and blend the
product throughout the front of the brow
because it blends better and then it's
not a massive chunk at the front if
you're going to do a block I need to be
at the end of the eyebrow of the arch
where it's meant to be more defined cool
I feel like this one is vital with
everyone's makeup you need to
at your eyelid can fill up when you use
an eye base actually no I think you have
to set a basis but if you use a
concealer as your eye base you need to
set it otherwise eyes shadows do not
blend properly they stick too much and
it just doesn't work so definitely set
your eyelids it's so important moving on
to the next little trick definitely do
not go in with your dark color eye
shadows first definitely go from light
to dark that's the mistake that a lot of
people do make and if you go from light
to dark it works a lot better if you try
and build up stuff over black eye shadow
it's not going to blend and also not
setting your concealer or your eye base
before your eye shadow that is also
going to affect it dramatically so yeah
it does not look good at all so what I
like to do is just go in with a lad
eyeshadow and then moving into the
darker ones so I'm just taking a light
brown and then a medium color Brown I
guess and just blending it all out and
it just works so much better and it
looks so much better and then eventually
you get into the darker color here as
you can see I'm just putting that on my
lid and my hat of E and then I am just
going to go in and blend that all up and
it just works so much better going from
light to dark rather than dark to light
because it doesn't work like it might
work for some of you but honestly I
don't know if it does there you go what
looks better thank you
moving on to the next little trick this
is winged eyeliner now winged eyeliner
is a very personal thing so you guys can
do it however you want as I stated at
the start I'm not telling you what to do
with this video but if you do have
hooded eyes like me this is a little
trick that might help you out a lot so
as you can see on the don't slide I made
a very thick big stick wing all across
my eyelid it tends to droop my eye and
like go up into my hood and not look
stunning at all so what I like to do
with my eyeliner is I basically follow
it up from my bottom lash line as you
can see my wings start at the bottom of
where my lower lash line is and then
goes out what I like to do across my
eyelid is just use a really thin line of
the gel liner not making it too thick so
doesn't get tucked into my hood and make
my eyes look droopy see what I mean
it looks so
shut up okay so next thing is lashes
they're so important to cut you need to
cut a little bit off the end and trim it
to your eye shape if you don't it might
droop your eyes in general on the
outsider will droop your eyes and not
make it look used so cut it to your eye
length and then stick it on and you
don't want the little bits on the end
sticking into the outer corner of your
eye or the inner corner of your eye
because it's really uncomfortable and
will probably make your eyes water and
then ruin your makeup for the whole day
not cute okay so moving on to the next
hack is choose your right foundation
shade now as you can see this is highly
over-exaggerated just for the sake of
the video it's sort of orange I
literally look like an oompa loompa not
going to like it's not far off my actual
foundation color when I am tan though
but makes you choose your right color
you can use a yellow base or pink base
any base that suits your preferences I
guess if you want to use a yellow
undertone foundation a pink undertone
foundation do whatever you please it
will just look better than that moving
on to the next thing this is concealer
don't use a concealer that is too dark
for you now what I was doing on the
don't side it actually looks okay which
I wasn't hoping to happen but it did
happen so it makes you choose a
concealer that is going to brighten
underneath your eyes and also just
another little trick make sure you bring
it down a triangle not just a circle so
it brightens that whole area and makes
it look it just brightens you up and
just makes you look so much better so
I'm just blending that out and look at
that it just looks so much better in my
opinion
I love it I love concealer so much next
thing is powder now I do see a lot of
people use this banana powder under
their eyes when they do have the do side
and it looks very Geller underneath the
eyes if you like that that's fine
however I don't think it looks all that
great
you could probably try using a
translucent powder that will not shot
any color and it won't change your
concealer or your foundation color and
it just looks so much better in my
opinion to put it that stunning moving
on contouring contouring can be overdone
or underdone
now on the don't side I'm applying this
way too low and it's going to droop my
face down what you want to do with
contouring is you want to bring it up
like you want to bring your cheekbones
up so what I like to do is go from the
corner of my ear and
to the corner of my mouth and then blend
it do you know what I mean like it's
really hard to explain but I'm basically
doing it right now and I just like to
blend that out and make my cheekbones
pop and sink the fat back rather than
bring it down do you not I mean does
that make sense I think it looks so much
better on the Jew side next thing is
applying way too much bronzer now I am a
culprit to this cause I do love my
bronzer or also bronzing after you
contour will not make your contour your
country I've grown muddy I just
discovered this the other day I
subscribe actually left a comment now I
was like oh my god so bronze I start you
contour looks so much better guys trust
me next you know we're talking of that
is a blush now blast can be overdone
really quickly like ready look oh what a
mess so I just like to apply a little
tiny bit on the apples of my cheeks and
blend back I like to avoid that smile
line because if you go any closer you're
going to look like a clown next
a little tip that I would like to talk
to you guys about is highlighter now
highlighter is one of those things you
can overdo or you can do it however you
like
however the point of telling you guys
this is it does really show up texture
on your skin so if you're highlighting
and you have like dry skin or dry
patches avoid those dry patches and if
you've got a lot of texture like deep
paws or acne avoid that area and just
live with it because it brings out a lot
of texture and it can look silly moving
on to the next little tip choose a lip
colors that will suit you so as you can
see on the doughnut I'm applying
something that is way too light for me
and just gives me that dead sort of look
but on the do side I'm taking a shade
that actually does suit me and doesn't
make me look dead however if you like
that nude the nude do bad so the next
door thing I want to talk about is if
you didn't know mac's fix+ isn't
actually a setting spray and will like
help keep your makeup in place
it's actually just a doing mess it's
just basically mineral water so if you
want to set your makeup and make it last
all day choose one with alcohol in it
because it will help dramatically and
you will notice a difference I going to
show you that so here we have all of the
have dudes on jars I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you want
swing me today
don't you concede that thumbs up button
subscribe to you on you I love you guys
so much and I'll see you all in my next
video bye
