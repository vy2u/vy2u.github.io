channel so today I'm just gonna be doing
another full face of first impressions
once again as per usual I have a lot of
new makeup that I do want you to try out
some from which I'm still catching up on
that I bought in America and I've also
got the Sephora Pro editorial palette
Sarah from beginning boutique was sweet
enough to pick this up for me when she
was in America a few weeks ago so I'm so
excited to use this ever since I saw
Kathleen lap sees this I've been like
holy I really need it and it's got
a black in there too which makes
everything so much better so I want to
kind of change it up and use like really
different colors and go a little bit out
there today so without any further ado
let's get straight into this video and I
hope you guys really enjoy
okay guys start I actually really wanna
have a lot of fun with this look and
completely change it up as I said at the
start so I'm gonna start off with this
turquoise he should sort of color and
I'm gonna be using this in my transition
today this is actually my favorite color
in the world as you can tell it's my
background and holy this is
pigmented as how already so I'm gonna
use this as my transition and I'm gonna
really pack this color on or as much as
it'll pack on and then we're just gonna
go from there I really want to give you
guys like a full look of this palette
with this video just so you know I can
give you like a full range of colors and
see how they blend and they pack on etc
etc in the palette there is quite a bit
of kick back and fall out but that's
okay because these are blending
perfectly and they are super super
pigmented as you can see we've got quite
a bit of fall out but that's fine
because we'll clean up afterwards this
is why I always do my eyes first you
guys because something like this does
happen it is completely fixable and you
don't have to worry about it now the
next time I'm gonna be taking is this
dark blue color here and I'm just gonna
take it on the morphe m4 double three
brush and more so we're gonna put it
into the outer corner of the lid so I'm
just gonna kind of blend this dark blue
color into the lighter blue color that I
put down previously actually was gonna
take a different brush just this pocket
brush and I'm gonna pack this on to see
if the color kind of builds up its kind
of blending into nothing I'm a little
bit disappointed in this color um it's
gonna blend this out of edged out okay
so that color is not packing on well a
whatsoever so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna change to this purple color just
next to it and we're gonna see if this
gives us some more pig leg
that's better
okay so what I'm gonna do now is I'm
gonna blend this up into my crease area
so guys that look did not work out
whatsoever that eyeshadows just went
slow patchy and I hate it so I've wiped
it off and I started a new base um so
let's just get into the whole new look
so let's try something else so I'm gonna
take this hot pink shade instead tap off
the that you don't need and then
just go to town I'm actually going to
use this mirror on this palette here so
I can get up nice and close all right so
I'm gonna put this in my crease and I'm
gonna use this as my transition now I
know this isn't everybody's cup of tea
pink eyeshadow sort of thing but just
wait until the end because I can
guarantee it's going to look pretty good
well I'm hoping so that's just what I
just got this vision in my eyes and
that's what I'm hoping for but who knows
what's gonna happen
ha I haven't been creative with makeup
in so long I just I don't know I just
haven't and I feel like I've kind of
lost my mojo with it so I really just
want to like try and just you know bring
it back because that's what I love doing
the Mars doing the Mars okay so this
shadow is blending sorry much better
than that one we just use the fall holy
 and it's packing on really really
good positive vibes so far I'm just
gonna take this fluffy brush and just
kind of blend out the edges alright so
next thing I'm gonna do is go into this
burgundy color it's like actually it's
like I'm over iron I don't know it's
like it's a little bit darker than this
pink color and I want to put this in my
crease and kind of build it up if it
does build really lightly touching my
eyelid just buffing out just out of edge
just a little bit more just to kind of
like a wing the shape out a little bit
so now what I want to do is I'm gonna be
taking the Tod shape tape in the shade
fair neutral and I want to kind of
create like a cut crease where it's my
phone it's going off so I'm just gonna
take this little brush here from Chevron
Beauty it's just a little flat sort of
brush and
gonna start doing like a race now
I'm going to take that turquoisey blue
color that I used in the look at the
fail the thing a look at the start and
I'm just gonna pack this onto my lid
holy yes bitch
ahh alright guys I'm trying to take a
clean brush and it just takes them with
those two pink shades just mixing them
together a little bit and then I'm just
popping that on the outer edge and then
kind of just blending that into the
green okay guys so I just got really
carried away and I managed to do this I
was just playing with the shadows but
I'm gonna show you how I did it on this
eye so basically all I did was I just
took a little brush
sorry many brushes going on in front of
me oh my goodness so I just took the
black shade from the Sephora palette and
I basically just popped it on my outer-v
and just plunked it right on that and
then I kind of brought it up here just
like across the lid and then I took that
dock like bag and do sort of color and
kind of blend it out that black I have
to go back in a few times and like clean
it all up so that's pretty much that and
then I just took a makeup wipe and just
cleaned up underneath so this is pretty
much what we're working with for now you
guys so now I'm gonna move on to my
lashes and get them stuck on now for my
lashes today I'm gonna be using a pair
of velu lashes now these were sent to me
in PR hence the packaging I'm so pretty
much they have like blue glitter on top
of like the lash band so it's a little
bit different something that I wouldn't
normally Garth for but I'm gonna do it
today and I'm gonna be using this style
called cherish now don't forget you guys
I do have a discount card for over lower
lashes I will leave it on the screen now
and also down below if you're interested
okay so now that my eyes are pretty much
all done besides underneath what we can
worry about that later you guys know how
it goes for my primer today I'm gonna be
trying out the gold Camilla Beauty oil
from tatcha
you guys know I love touches my favorite
skincare at the moment amongst a few
other little things so this isn't oil so
I don't really tend to use oils on my
face but we're gonna give this so well
oh my gosh it smells so good
touches whole range smells incredible if
you have not tried I highly recommend
because it doesn't break me out which is
everything I do have quite a bit of acne
at the moment because I am stressed out
about a few little things in my life you
know and that's just what happens and
plus I have been eating a little bit of
junk for a day at least said that's
probably not helping it also but when I
get stressed out I tend to break out a
lot on my neck here and that's kind of
what's like lower face that's kind of
what's going on at the moment sorry
we're just gonna ignore that and cover
it all up with foundation because that's
what's foundation is a really really
good at for my foundation today I'm
gonna be trying out the Tom Ford
traceless foundation this is in the
shade 3.0 pale June so Tom Ford is like
a really luxury brand um I'm really
tried much stuff from him to be honest
I've only tried like the bronzer and the
highlighter the bronzer I've actually
lost I always lose my favorite things
like my highlighting brushes are still
missing and I think they're not missing
I pretty sure they're literally gone for
life now so I'm just gonna have to get
used to that okay let's see what the
coverage is like on this foundation oh I
feel like it's not gonna be very full
coverage you guys just from putting it
on like oh this coverage is not good and
it's oxidized already this is oxidized
so much ever since I just put it on I
mean it looks like skin but it's not
full coverage and that's not what we're
here for so instead of using that I'm
just gonna go straight over the top with
the Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation now shiny raved about this
ages ago and I brought up when we were
in America and I just didn't ever get
around to testing it out so I'm just
gonna go over the top of this foundation
with this and see how this goes now
apparently it's a super super super full
coverage which is everything because
that's what we want
this little pimped out right here right
in the middle there you just need a
off and not come back as I have had
absolutely enough I'm just gonna spray
my Beauty Blender with a little bit of
fix+ first before going in and blending
this all out but let's see how this
works and blends obviously gonna get it
down this neck here next
sorry plural thanks low wow this
coverage is actually super good let's
see how bears on Windows
I'm lacking I'm living on loving just
gonna take some more of this Clinic
Foundation and just you're like another
land see if I can build up coverage even
more even though it is pretty good
coverage it's not exactly how I'd like
it so just gonna add a second layer and
see if this improves its got like a
Jewish as well which is kind of nice to
see thing is a lot of the foundations
that I use a matte bambam bam-bam-bam
okay guys I'm just gonna start doing my
forehead I just concealed the tops of my
brows just with the foundation so it's
the same color and it all matches in now
I'm some taking my booty looking ass
blend ooh there yes and just pound this
into my skin it's receding hell and
needs to be fixed a stop because I'm not
living for it at all now of course I
don't have a new concealer to try so I'm
just gonna go in with my trusty tape but
a diddly-squat shape in the shade
light/medium honey and then I'm just
gonna take it underneath my eyes and I'm
gonna let that sit there for a bit
because in a few videos ago I asked you
guys I I saw a youtuber let it sit there
so it gets like thinking kind of warms
up so it is full of coverage it turns
out it was Jackie aina that I was
watching and I do kind of recall
watching that I'm just gonna blend in my
t-zone area first does it piss you off
when I look in the viewfinder all the
time cuz I'm starting to get really bad
at it and it's actually starting to I'm
starting to piss myself off by looking
at her all the time but really long if
this pimple does not conceal itself it's
literally not concealing because it's
like red it's like dry Balad I know that
sounds rank but like realtalk it is
okay we're just gonna have to deal with
it we can deal with a pimp dad can't we
guys okay now I'm just gonna start
blending and
under eyes and I daren't heaven here
 hell I do not have any
translucent powder to try out so
annoying what I like to do you guys when
I get to like at the corner of my eye
shadow I just like to take some can feel
our or foundation and I just like to run
that along with like a flat shader brush
just to get that really crisp line
rather than trying to get in there with
the Beauty Blender and it off so
I just got mache just like that and then
I just kind of drag it down now to set
my under eyes I'm just gonna going with
the dermablend professional setting town
I haven't used this in a while how am I
still sir I'm just gonna keep some of
that out into the lid and then just go
to town underneath my eyes just to kind
of bake this area besides they're too
much baking stay just a little bit just
a little bit fan and then just you set
the rest of my foundation I'm gonna be
going in with the Milani had a
foundation in the shade shall wow what
is going on with me today oh what
did I just put on there ah is that
a dirty lens now me I've had enough
okay guys now that this lens is nice and
clean I think from what I can tell I'm
just gonna set the rest of my face with
this Milani powder this foundation I'm
really liking it so far so far so good
and it's got like a really nice
undertone to it is this really dark this
camera let's turn this up a little bit
that's better
sorry guys the the camera
there's being a today and I've had
enough I'm just gonna Pat this
foundation on rather than swerve around
cuz when you swerve around it moves all
the product and just to think so
your hard work in my opinion and I'm
just gonna be dragging that down the
neck just so everything matches up and
it doesn't look like my head is a full
loading okay now just going back in
underneath my eyes what should we do
I'm feeling like this color here this is
sorry different you guys but I'm just
gonna go ahead and do it anyway cuz
ya'll are I'm just gonna pop this
orangey sort of color right underneath
wow that's so pretty and then I'm going
to take this little brush here I'm gonna
take a little bit of that black
eyeshadow and I'm just gonna pop it
right underneath up against my lash line
in the outer corner and I'm just gonna
kind of blend this down cool
sorry different but I'm kind of living
for it now too so choose a lot my face a
little bit I'm just gonna be taking the
whole lot from benefit and I'm just
gonna go in and start contouring away
this head oh love contouring sorry much
because it literally pretty much just
changes the shape of your whole face
like I feel like contouring is so
important especially if you're a makeup
lover and especially contouring the draw
line I mean I always face chin my jaw
line a little bit maybe a lot yeah I
think it just brings your face so much
dimension so as you can see I've just
done that one half of my face contouring
and this is no contouring so you can
just see that it like adds warmth and
contrast I guess so I'm just gonna go
ahead and chisel out this side of my
face and I'll come back to you guys and
then won't stop blush and highlighter
this video is going on forever but
editorial oh good so now this to bronze
up my face a little bit more I'm just
gonna be taking the butter buttons are
from Physicians Formula this is one of
my all-time favorite drugstore bronzers
when I did my master class in Melbourne
I was talking about this and everyone
was saying that it's always sold out and
it's sort of hard to get because a lot
of Priceline stores only stock like a
little tiny amount of this I don't know
why it's not as big in Australia is it
as it is in the States because well it
needs to be because it's a staple in my
drugstore collection and it smells so
good as well like so good yeah I'm just
gonna be dragging that all the way down
my neck next plural and across my
forehead keeping this area sort of free
of bronze like to give like that
brighten sort of look in the center of
the face do you know what I mean
notice for a little bit of blush I'm
just gonna go into the it cosmetics bye
bye applause blush this is in the shade
and naturally pretty and lets them take
a little bit of that just on this
stippling brush and just add it to the
apples of my cheeks and kind of brush
backwards and forwards if you brush your
blush or I said that right if you brush
your blush on fours it gives a more
natural look I think I learned that off
Mario
I don't know how to say his last name
Kim Kardashian's like main makeup artist
if you brush it forward it looks more
natural not than anything about this
look is natural but we're just gonna go
with that now just going with some
highlighter I'm just gonna be using the
ciate London moon dust highlighter
straight on my cheeks oh that's stunning
when I can recall I have used this
highlighted before and I really liked it
I think well I'm liking it now sorry I'm
just going to pack this highlighter on
to the high points of my face as we go
for the noise by the way guys I just go
off camera and contour my nose however I
do have a full full video on that so
I'll leave it linked down below now for
my lip color I'm gonna be trying out the
ciate London liquid velvet lipstick in
the shade one because my eyes are so
crazy I wanted to keep my lips kind of
lacked a little bit more simple like I
never do nudes anyway but we're just
gonna go ahead and try this out this lip
color and formula feels so beautiful on
the lips I'm so impressed and I'm really
sad that I haven't actually tried it
certainly um okay so just before we
finish up on my face I'm just gonna take
the earth FRA glazed donut highlighter
this is the nikkietutorials collab and
I'ma just put this on the inner corners
of my eyes wow that is so intense now I
just want that juhi look to finish off
this whole look so I'm just gonna put
some prep and prime fix+ on my face now
for anyone thinking that this is a
makeup setting spray it's actually not
it does not set your makeup it just
gives like a juhi sort of look to the
makeup and gets rid of that like powdery
sort of look but in no way shape or form
does it set your makeup it's literally
just like mineral water in a bottle with
a really it's like Oprah it's like
twenty eight dollars its overpriced but
um it's pretty good so I'll give it that
and I have used a few years but to
actually set my face I'm just gonna go
in with the Gerard cosmetics plate or a
setting spray in the shade green tea /
ginger this is absolutely full of
alcohol so if you're after a setting
spray that really does
work keep your makeup on the only
problem about it is it is full of
alcohol it's not good for your skin and
can cause wrinkles but that's just where
I get Botox and fix it all up so I don't
really stress about that too much just
gonna set everything and do not ever use
this and then open your eyes straight
away because if you get this in your
eyes it stings because it's alcohol and
it will irritate your eyes and it will
hurt anyway guys this is the completed
look I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video and you enjoyed me doing something
a little more out there something a
little bit more different this needs to
go cuz it's if you guys want to
see more tutorials and videos and just
me playing with makeup and chatting to
you guys and just kind of just going
with the floor and seeing whatever the
 happens happens make sure you let
me know down below and if you did enjoy
this video and make sure you bet a
massive thumbs up I love you guys so
much and I will see you all in my next
video see y'all err</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
