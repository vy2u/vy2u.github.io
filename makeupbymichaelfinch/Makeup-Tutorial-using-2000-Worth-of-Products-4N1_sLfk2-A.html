today I'm going to be doing a full face
of makeup using over $2,000 worth of
 makeup now to me this is crazy
that there are actually makeup product
and view product out there that cost up
to like you can be wearing $2,000 of
makeup on your face I think that is
absolutely crazy I'm really excited to
do this because I drill up a lot of
drugstore makeup but I also love a lot
of high-end makeup as well so I'm keen
to see what this is going to look like
and I also had a little bit of fake tan
on for a change so y'all have been my
coming for me saying when should make
tan gone like I just got over it for a
very very very long time and for those
asking no wasn't about the name
if anything that mean grew me on YouTube
so thank you that mean was made out of
hate that it grew me so thank you
without any further drills get straight
into this video I'm so excited and if
you do enjoy this video make sure you
give it a massive thumbs up and if you
have any video requests leave them down
below they're starting off with brows
I'm going to be taking the goof proof
brow pencil from benefits and I'm just
gonna start putting this through three
mobile so I'm more or less just filling
in the natural shape yes and lately I've
been like I mean not lately for the past
like six months have been absolutely
loving like non Instagram brows I kind
of like a natural thin brows obviously
just doing exactly the same on this
brows that penty been coming up up oh do
you wanna say how lower the side of the
videos this is bindi everyone for those
who don't know who the end users may
veteran shiny is a dog and I'm literally
obsess about everyone thinks that she's
my dog which is actually not my dog I
wish she was though she's so cute
Thank You biggie bending what have you
done I don't think she likes the light
soon as she gets scared of them because
her eyes just go like really close so
goodbye to everyone on the camera say
bye
yeah not a problem and sleep in so next
I'm going to be taking the benefit gimme
brow through my brows so what this does
is it basically just like tints the
hairs and makes them a little bit more
intense shut the
and yeah I'm just gonna brush my hair
upwards keep cool
now I'm going to be taking the a benefit
of 3d brow tones and this just kind of
like to be completely honest with you I
don't actually know what it does but I'm
just going to put it through my brows I
think it gives like a little bit of
color like a little bit of a lot of
color I'd know the more the merrier in
the brows in my opinion well come out
making bushy as and move on to the
next thing and lastly I'm going to be
taking the Ready Set brow by benefit and
just literally just like say so say so
six you know still looking bushy AF and
I'm loving it okay now that my browser
will done the Groupon to my eyes and for
my eye base today I'm going to be using
the heart shape tape this is in the
shade affair mutual safe concealer ever
so I'm just going to conceal under my
brow just a little bit instagraming not
too much you know and then just going to
be taking that concealer all over my lid
so we have like this flawless base going
on which is exactly what we need for our
shadow I'm just planning this out with a
damp Beauty Blender this is the best way
to do what I feel I'm going to take a
little bit of translucent powder and
just set my lids with that translucent
perfect managed to get concealer all
under my eyes but I do that every single
video not our problem
now for my eye shadow today I'm going to
be using two different palettes and
these are both from the Tasha generally
no these are ridiculously expensive
there's only eyes 365 and this one is
$221 not a problem so these are
the colors in this one here and these
other colors in this money house so
they're gorge colors but I mean are they
worth how much they are I don't know
let's have a gaze shall we bin first of
all I'm going to go into is this one
just here like a transition is sort of
showed and I'm just going to pop that in
my outer crease and blend up now they're
quite pigmented and they're blending
very well and I've literally only just
started applying this so I think it's
gonna be good now this camera that I'm
using right now I don't actually have my
camera so I'm using a different one and
I can't
it doesn't zoom in so this is the best I
can do so I'm sorry for that but the
eyes I'm going to be that extra
rather daunting they're blending out so
well and they're sorry pigmented as well
which is amazing now that I've laid down
that transition color I'm going to go
into this darker brown shade here and
I'm not going to do a warm tone I kinda
wanted to a call turn sort of look with
maybe a bit of burgundy and like a bit
of this bit of that I don't know what's
going to happen it's just going to
happen oh my god hey been waking me up
hey do you think I should do a green
like smokey eye or a bag and dislike
yellow green okay I think so too so I'm
just going to continue on and put this
brown in my outer-v
just gonna kind of bring it up through
oh it's so annoying I always had this
one patch on my eye that just never
sticks to I shudder and it
literally does my nothing I'm
just going to blend out those edges of
the Z Brown because next I can black in
this eyeshadow palette it's definitely
not worth the amount of money that it is
I honestly think every single eyeshadow
palette needs to have a black in it like
what the you need to make these
looks versatile wait until I come out
with an eyeshadow palette one days it's
literally going to be every single color
in there in the world so you need plus a
black a really gorgeous black it's going
to blend it out with a bit more of that
transitioning color actually I'm going
to change from doing a green to like a
burgundy so I'm just going to take this
shade in the middle here and I'm just
going to go to town on my outer V okay
maybe not because it's literally not
showing up maybe we'll try this burgundy
at the top but that color just did not
do anything and this one is literally
just falling off it actually
serious no go what sort of
eyeshadows do that just literally fall
off and just don't even like so this
like don't even bother going on
my Luke is not even going to
 ijen the end anyway not a
problem so instead I'm gonna take this a
shimmery color right here just on this
little cute brush these eyeshadows such
a weird formula I'm just on top
and I'm just gonna Pat this this is like
 chalk are you chilly serious
right now like it's literally just
flaking off into literally nothing I
mean like yeah it's pigmented but
its chalky as
flaky oh my god and it's so chunky I
mean like I love Natasha to Nona like
the hair foundation is amazing but this
eyeshadow palette just is really not the
greatest I'm just gonna blend around the
edge a junior Natasha just came out with
a new eyeshadow palette and it's like
gorge colors maybe the formulas changed
or like it's better because this is a
little bit carved so I was expecting to
do the most dramatic gorge dialogue with
this palette but honestly I just can't
I'm just going to take some of this
shade up here on my finger and just
apply it straight to my eyelid because
that other color was so boring like that
apply so much better maybe it was the
brush but still like it's not very
beneficial to use your finger
with eyeshadows only because what if
you're doing it on clients you're not
going to jab your finger in
there iron you know okay guys moving on
to the face this is a moisturizer this
is the medic eight-seat era vitamin C a
day cream this is a hundred and
thirty-five dollars so I'm just going to
go ahead and rub this into my skin
smells good not a problem
moving on to primer this is the gray
lane primer and I think you say it like
it's a la lot all I think no
anyway it's got like real gold flakes on
or some so it should be gorge this
is a $97 primer so I'm only going to use
a little bit because it's not mine you
know and I just wanna it smells that
good that's stunning
all these little gold flakes all over
your skin which is gorge currently give
you a first impressions on that one
because you just never know if primers
actually work or not but it feels good
as I've got little gold flakes all over
my skin so I'm not sure if you meant to
take them off believe them on but I'm a
legal one moving on to foundation this
is the ilaria la priori I don't
know how to say it
foundation this is worth three hundred
and seventy five dollars I mean like
what the Lamar one that I bought a few
months ago was $200 this is 275 it's
like taking it to a whole new level but
I think there is a lot of produit to it
in here so should be fine so it comes on
a little spatula thing not very
beneficial om tangents moment hence why
it's quiet
it's gonna take my Beauty Blender and
see what this foundation and does I mean
like what like it sits really well on
the skin but I would love to know what
the made this brand charge two
hundred and seventy five dollars it's
literally just the name I feel like it's
the name that you paying for I mean it
looks like it would be full coverage
when you're putting it on but is
honestly like lied to medium nowhere
near full but I think it's meant to be
full coverage though should be
though it looks really glowy and pretty
on the skin but it's just not making the
cut $275 I mean come on now I'm just
going to take this foundation just like
around my brows just so they're nice and
concealed you know now moving on to my
under eye concealer I'm going to be
taking the bare minerals Basking
concealer in the shade of light and I'm
just going to go to town under these
eyes with a munoz but the bear and the
clothes know I'm gonna just blend this
out and see how it goes for coverage I
mean like the coverage isn't the best
but like it's something you know I mean
I feel like it can feel but it didn't
conceal like as well as I want it to so
you guys can only guess what I'm gonna
do
Sarah not a problem just put a little
bit of me top shape diddly-squat take
one of that this is going to brighten it
up a little bit and just add a little
bit more concealer and highlight a
little bit because the concealer that I
just used was literally the same shade
as my found deadly Dacian bus but ah
it's just given me a little bit more
like I'm a highlighted sort of effect
however my skin does look really nice
and glowy and like 9:00 and I'm really
loving this so far now moving on to set
my under eyes I'm going to be taking the
LA I'm just going to give up on how to
 say at la Prairie
whatever Switzerland historical
wank translucent powder
okay perfect sorry I'm going to use this
to bake underneath my under eyes how's
everyone very trans listen to me if this
brings off color and get through of my
highlight on my under eyes and they
email their customer service so I'm just
going to depend
I'm just set on my undereyes
trans loser I don't think so
bendy what I'm also just going to set
the areas where I put two concealer as
well okay I don't really know what to
think of this it's very different to
powders that I normally use but I mean
like whatever to set the rest of my
foundation today I'm going to be using
this compact powder foundation from
Chanel so Eugene and not a problem so
I'm gonna just take that and just
lightly tap over there other areas of
the things so it needs to be set I'm
also just wiping off that under-eye bake
as I go because I do not like the look
of it okay so I'm looking extremely
matte right now which I'm not loving
moving on to contractors to see a Marc
Jacobs Mirage filter contouring and
highlighting palette absolutely staying
so I'm going to take this sort of cool
tone shade here it looks very cool time
so I don't know how would it go
I mean like what that is so cool times I
think that's too cool time for me okay
so I'm not going to use I think that I'm
going to take the dark chocolate Soleil
d-10 and matte bronzer and hopefully
this is a bit better
oh what not go so touching just
blend it out oh my god I'm just going to
use this just generously contouring
around my forehead to try and bring it
in a little bit because it is so
abnormally large to be completely honest
with you I think my forehead it
literally looks like an airport in the
International Airport because that's a
 big it is not a problem okay I'm
just gonna finish contouring slightly
don't forget to contour around your
jawline just a little bit or a lot if
you fact like me keep that okay so I
wasn't all that impressed with the Marc
Jacobs contour I think it's just too
cool time for me right now you know if I
wasn't ten I think it would be fine but
not today Satan not today now moving on
to your actual bronze I'm going to be
taking one of my favorite ones this is
the Marc Jacobs tantric or mega bronzer
and I'm literally obsessed with it so
I'm going to take my favor bronzing
brush at the moment this is the morphe
r7
have done and just go to town and I want
to look really orange and like a really
overbought contour today do not I mean I
just love this front love so much is
that good not a problem it's all in my
head what this bronzer is everything if
you're looking for a high-end bronzer
that is absolutely saying go to Sephora
and get your hands on this if it's
in stock it's literally always out of
stock so if it is out of stock on their
website and they will email you when it
is back in just going to run that runs
down the side of my nose to because it
literally got lost I never thought I'd
say that my nose actually got lost
because it is literally decide that
thing in Malayan what even is the
Himalayas I know it's big but it's like
a forest or some or as an animal
okay now that I'm looking contoured and
bronze I'm going to be taking this
Natasha - no no blush this is the sheer
peachy nude blush trio and I'm going to
take this color on this side here just
on oh my god it's so calorie this is so
nice it's kind of got like a luminosity
like glow to it oh my god this is so
pretty
just going to blush it just going to
brush it backwards towards my temp dad's
up here now that looks finish off my
eyes so I want to kind of do something
quirky and a little bit different to
what I normally do I'm going to take
this palette by Julia's place here it's
called the masquerade palette and I'm
pretty sure I want to do like pink and
purple smoke under my eyes because I
always do the same and you guys
will like call me out for it and I know
you're a lot of call me out for because
I know you get sick of it of me doing it
so I'm going to take this pinky shade
here called is over which is AB star and
I'm just going to go literally straight
underneath my lash line and it's
stunning it's so pink and pigmented
because that'd be looking a hot mess I
blend this out I'm going to take a
little bit of this warm brown shade back
from the Natasha Turner palette
see if I can blend it down without
messing it up too much well it is
literally no idea what I just created
but I'm just going to do the other eye
and then we'll get started on the lashes
mascara all that
ok guys moving on to the scar I'm just
going to be taking the benefit roller
lash disease it literally my favorite
one of my favorites I've got several
favorite mascaras you guys know the girl

 Wayne God eyes nothing so I'm
just going to take a ton of that on
my brush and well sorry go oh yeah
that's better
what do we think everyone nothing too
special about it I mean I feel like mary
lou manizer by the balm would even do a
better job like it's definitely a gorge
highlighter and it looks amazing but the
camera and the lights problem making it
look so great right now but it's
honestly not that good in person like
it's a nice how about a bit I expected
more from Dior now for my lips today I'm

favorite okay once mannequin is on I'm

set everything in place I'm just going
to be taking the cha-cha Jewish skin
mint and just doing a little bit of a
spritz just to let everything set
together and be absolutely stunning and
here we have the final and finished look
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video I had a lot of fun filming it and
to be honest I honestly feel like you're
only paying for the name when you buy a
high-end some high-end products like you
know but like $275 for a foundation is a
little bit ridiculous three hundred and
seventy dollars for an eyeshadow palette
it's a little bit chalky and a little
bit cooked is you get what I'm saying
right anyway I really hope you guys
somewhat enjoyed this video if you did
please don't forget to give me a massive
thumbs up I love you guys so much and I
will see you all in my next video bye
