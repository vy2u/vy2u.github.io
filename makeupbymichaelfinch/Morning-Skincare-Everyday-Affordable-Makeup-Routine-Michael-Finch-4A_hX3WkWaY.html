today I'm gonna be doing a skincare
routine and morning skincare routine and
an updated everyday makeup tutorial this
makeup tutorial isn't for everyone but
it's for me and I think it looks really
really nice still full coverage
obviously but what else to expect from
me now let's start off with the skin I'm
taking my spin for perfect skin a vanity
planet facial cleansing brush this thing
actually moves around like it's
battery-operated so you put batteries in
and it moves around on your face so you
don't have to do any of the work I just
take a cleanser and this one's got quite
a bit of exfoliant in it so I do have
oily skin so I like to have something a
little bit more intense and I basically
just put that on my well I'm having a
little jam right now but basically as I
just put that on my face and move it all
around I mix it with a little bit of
water I do but my face before this but
you guys didn't see it and I probably do
this for about a minute yeah for about a
minute now I do have a discount codes of
disguise you get 70% off and you need to
use the code on Michaels 7 so I'll leave
all information down below in the
description box if you're interested in
getting this product then I just like to
take a wet washcloth and just wipe
everything off my face and then I go in
with a moisturizer just to I don't
really know what moisturizer does to be
honest it just moisturize the skin so I
just go in with that and I probably do
my makeup three hours after doing this
because I don't like doing moisturizer
and then straight on to makeup I feel
like it breaks down foundation then I'm
just scrubbing my lips with a bit of a
lip scrub and yeah that's basically it
just makes you feel so good
any exfoliant does but this is of course
I'm eating a typical me then I'm just
taking it some lip balm this is just
mango lip balm it smells and tastes
amazing yeah moving on to the makeup
today I'm using the LA girl Pro prep
primer HD this is so good and fills in
all your pores cuz I'm 99% sure it's
silicone based for my foundation today
this is the L'Oreal infallible 24-hour
matte foundation I don't have any fake
tan on so I'm obviously matching this to
my neck hence why it's such a different
color from what I normally use and I'm
just blending that in with my damp
beauty
glenda this has a really really really
good coverage you guys like super good
coverage so I'm just blending that out
until everything it is seamless the
beauty blender is the best way to blend
our foundation 100% if you don't have
one you need to get one for my concealer
today I'm using the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade 10 light was on
the 10 light or 15 pressure was 10
because it was a lot lighter than the
other one that I normally use I'm just
putting that under my eyes my nose my
chin and a bit on my forehead just to
conceal a little bit more and just to
brighten not gonna this bryson too much
because it's not too much different from
the foundation color but it just kind of
concealed a little bit of extra redness
that was left behind on my skin blending
that in with the Beauty Blender again
under my eyes my forehead my nose just
basically everywhere I put the damn
concealer you know what I'm talking
about
and now to bake I'm just baking a little
bit this is not an everyday thing for
everyone to bake on an everyday basis
but for me it's an essential because I
was because I'm sorry extra so I just
baked under my eyes a little bit and
then just setting the rest of my
foundation with a pressed powder this
has coverage to it so this will give you
a bit more color and it will also add
some coverage that's the Australis fresh
and flawless hey guys I use that in
literally every tutorial so I'm sure
your sickest thing up by now I wish I
could change it up and then just taking
a light brown eyeshadow this is by
makeup geek all the shadows I'm using
today are by makeup geek I will leave
the mister down below so you guys know
what they are and I'm basically just
putting that through my crews and then
I'm just going in with a darker shade of
brown this is called cocoa bear I know
because I know what cocoa bear looks
like off the top of my head because it
is one of my favorite eyeshadows ever
from makeup geek and I'm just kind of
blending that on the out of thee and
then I'm just taking a bigger blending
brush and blending those two colors
together now this part is optional you
can either put Brown on your eyelid or
you can just put like a shimmery color
if you want it to be a little bit more
bright so you can have a little bit of
shimmer on your your lid and then just
taking two of those brown shade mixed
together underneath my lash line and
finishing that off with a bit pearls
mascara this is the Maybelline great
lash you know watch and just a little
bit on my bottom lashes as well now for
my lashes today these
by model rock these are the 219 so I got
these from shot me say there are only a
dollar I think I really ever use these
but just for like an everyday look then
I would probably wear these probably not
I probably go more minke but I'm trying
to make this like good for everyone to
contour I'm just using the break-up
shade from makeup geek I really liked
using this however I struggle with
getting an on muddy contour when I'm
really quite pale when I'm not say ten
um so yeah I don't know how I went with
that I think it looks okay let me know
what you guys think and then just
washing off washing off the and then
just wiping off a bit of my baked under
my eyes and then for some blush I'm just
using the Milani baked blush in the
shade and women are so just for a bit of
a peachy little glow so highlighter this
is the mary lou manizer you can get this
from Target a target if you guys don't
know what I'm talking about in Australia
and then topping it off with the NYX or
lingerie lipstick I'll leave the shade
for this down below I have no idea what
it is it's not the best liquid lipstick
I've used but it's good for a drugstore
lipstick just set my face I'm just using
the LA girl Pro makeup setting spray and
that is pretty much it I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did don't
forget to give me a thumbs up I love you
guys so much and I'll see you all in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
