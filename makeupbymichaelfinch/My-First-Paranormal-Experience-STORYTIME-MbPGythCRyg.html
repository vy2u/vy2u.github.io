come here right now can you stop chewing
on that buddy come here now hello guys
welcome back to my channel so as you can
tell I'm in a different part of my
apartment today I'm in my living room
just to change it up a little bit I have
wanted to start doing story time video I
suppose such a long time now
sorry I think now is the perfect
opportunity I just got back from Mykonos
and I was with a couple of youtubers who
also do story times and they inspired me
to start doing them I have some amazing
story times to tell some I shouldn't
really be telling but some I'm going to
be telling anyway regardless of the
situation but before I get started I
wanted to introduce someone she guys
here on youtube if you don't follow me
on Instagram and snapchat you would not
know that I bought a dog finally his
name is buddy I actually decided on his
name to be buddy this morning literally
kind of helped me out with that I've
been struggling but like buddy is like
so cute so his name is now buddy a lot
of people said Gucci but like that's
kinda tacky um originally I wanted a
Gucci but that was like a year ago
Kate excuse me can you come here buddy
come here now my god I have to get him
so guys this is a buddy oh he's so cute
isn't he sir he is a caboodle yeah he's
a caboodle sorry he's kind of like
Shaunie's dokey not um yeah this is what
he looks like and he's super cute he's
super sad at the moment cause he just
ain't so he like is thank you
so cute oh my god I want you so much
this is buddy
say hi buddy there's a good boy look at
the camera ah good boy okay now you can
go play darker than my microphone buddy
ah naughty sorry getting into today's
video I've been wanting to know you guys
this was so long now and this was like
my first real paranormal experience it
was so scary I was literally crying and
so was my friend at the time and when it
all happened excuse me going back at
least three to four years ago actually
probably like three years ago
that's when all the crazy pretty
much happened in my life sorry to set
the scene I was living back in my
hometown a little country town and my
really good friend had just moved into a
new place now this little house was kind
of on a farm it was kind of in the
middle of nowhere out of town a little
bit it was kind of creepy it was kind of
old and there was like a weird vibe
about it know that that will have
anything to do with what actually
happened but safe to say she moved out
straight afterwards it did happen
because it was not fun at all
actually that's a lie something actually
did happen at the house that was not to
do with the other part of the story you
guys are gonna understand why I'm like
saying it in two parts afterwards it's
gonna make so much more sense so one
night I decided to go over to her house
for just like a coffee and just chill
out it was winter at the time so it was
super super cold so her dog basically
needed to take a piss so we went outside
and took it outside and we're just
sitting on the edge of the balcony for
like five minutes just you know waiting
for him to do his business and whatnot
so he just kind of started getting
talking about stupid random ass and
knowing me I was just like oh this place
is kind of creepy like it was really
really dark it was just like farmland so
it was kind of scary it was just
literally black like he looked out and
it was just black and because I'm sorry
into this sort of stuff I was like
imagine if we found a Ouija board under
the house would you do it and at that
point we've both got our torches on our
phones just like have a little look to
see if there was anything under there
just because we were curious and there
wasn't so I think there was a Ouija
board and I guess that there was a Ouija
board there cuz I wasn't low-key kind of
wish that was not that I would do it
back would be pretty cool sir as soon as
I said imagine if there was a Ouija
board would you do it the light the lamp
outside started flickering I'm not even
kidding it started flickering and she's
like oh my god that has never
turned on before like I'm starting to
get the shakes getting into this story
like he was so real and it just gets
worse and I'm probably gonna cry because
it was so anyway this lamp
started flickering and I was like are
you like are you being serious like
you're not joking that that's never you
know turned on before she's like no
that's never turned on like the lamps
blown and it literally just started
flickering and I was like oh oh my god
buddy come here I need some company
after that it happened we
kind of started freaking out and then I
was like okay so I got my snapchat out
so I started snapchatting her sitting
there on the balcony with this LAN
flicker in the background and I went to
put it on my story being like holy
what the actual is going on this is
so weird
as my friend had said previously that
this lamp light had never ever turned on
before sorry I started I've actually got
real footage of it but I can't show you
guys cuz I don't want to reveal with my
friends identity just because of the pot
that I'm gonna say next it's really not
okay sorry I started filming her on my
phone I'm filming her I don't see
anything
ah I want to die thinking about this
this is so up
briar stop I you not I look down at
my farm and there is a grain or going
around her body like this so then I'm
looking at it and I'm like holy
holy we're both freaking out at
this time it gets worse
so we both got really curious as to what
this green or was it was kind of like a
turquoise sea green or sorry I jumped on
Google now the main part that this orb
was focusing around was her stomach area
ah sorry I jumped on Google anyway I
started doing some research and we came
across a website called wishing moon or
some I think this was the right the
right one I just found the website oh
yeah I seriously am so terrified right
now sorry now before I read out what
this actually means on the website I
want to tell you guys that this will
connect up when I tell you that she had
had a mishap that scared the out of
me so unfortunately my friend at the
time had actually had a miscarriage or a
pregnancy that didn't really work out
I'm not really sure exactly what
happened but it was something along the
lines of that we jump on Google here is
the definition green in spiritual
practice Green is associated with the
heart it is also associated with nature
green orbs are sometimes thought to be
an indication of the presence of a human
spirit as opposed to one that was never
on earth in human form
I tell you what when we saw that we shut
ourselves and we birth
that's my microphone buddy stop
we literally shut ourselves we couldn't
stop shaking and crying we went inside
and she moved out literally a few days
later it was the most scariest thing
like it's kind of like it's kind of like
nice in a way but like I fully believe
in spirits poltergeists Ouija boards
Garth's paranormal stuff conspiracy
theories the government's trying to kill
us all I'll shut up now but that's just
my beliefs sorry that was my first
paranormal experience I hope you guys
