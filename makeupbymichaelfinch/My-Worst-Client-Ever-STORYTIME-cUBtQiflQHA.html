Channel today I'm back again for another
story time video I hope you guys enjoyed
the last one I hope it was entertaining
but this one is gonna be even better by
the way I'm super hungry and
I've got a burrito as I would have cold
so I'm gonna be stuffing my face with
this throughout the video so it's kind
of like a milk-bone however is actually
gonna be impossible to eat with this one
wandering around so I'll have to wait
until after sorry getting into today's
video if you guys can't tell from the
title of this video I am gonna be
talking about my worst client ever now
for those who don't know when I was
younger probably around 16 I started
taking clients back when I lived in my
hometown okay so to set the scene I'm
freshly eighteen I just had got my
license so I just started driving around
and I was asked to go and do a wedding
party about three hours away from my
house so I had to drive there three
hours away let's just say the client who
wanted me to do this was all over the
place like all over the place that's the
nicest way I can put it cuz generally
she is a really lovely lady but it just
got up so I knew that this woman
was really extravagant and over-the-top
and just like super super dramatic like
once at the craziest wedding dress so
she had emailed me and hit me up on
Facebook to do her wedding party can you
be quiet please thank you and I was like
of course but it's three hours away
she's like yeah you can drive here I'll
give you a thousand dollars if you drive
here I'm like okay amazing so she gave
me a thousand dollars to drive there and
back which is six hours of driving which
is actually really really really really
good I took it because it was a lot of
driving in a lot of time so she pretty
much said that I can stay in one of her
caravans now when I got there oh my god
so when I got teary at this place and I
met them and everything was all good she
took me into her Caravan where I was
going to be staying and I'm not even
kidding you there was now at the time I
wasn't really sure of what a lot of
things were so I walked in and on the
little table in the caravan they were
there was a few people in there and they
were rolling joints which is weird for
those who don't know and there was
people snorting lines of cocaine oh this
is the day before the wedding when I saw
that I do
know what to do like I didn't I didn't
know whether to cry or go home I thought
 this I'm getting a lot of money for
this I was meant to be doing her wedding
makeup and two of her bridesmaids makeup
and her mum's so the day before we had a
trial and everything was all good it was
just really really really hard to do her
makeup and get her to stop talking yeah
that's not why she's my worst client
ever that is not why so I had the trial
and everything was all good so it came
to the next day now this is where
everything started going down
Hill
so I'd woken up the next day around nine
o'clock to get all my together and
I had planned to do her makeup at 11
o'clock in the morning because she was
having a sunset wedding and she's gonna
be taking photos all day and whatnot I
didn't end up doing her makeup until 6
o'clock that night now her wedding was
meant to start at 6 o'clock mind you she
had asked me to stay all day do
touch-ups at the wedding go to the
wedding with them and do touch-ups after
that's being married and whatnot and
then I could drive home and leave at
like some ungodly hour
so I was expecting to leave around 9
o'clock I didn't end up leaving until
one o'clock I did her makeup around 6
o'clock that night she could completely
miss the reception everything was
running sir so light sir the reason why
she was so late
rewind about 5 to 6 hours when we walked
into the caravan me and two of the
bridesmaids to get her and see where the
 she was because like 11 o'clock
came round she wasn't there to get her
makeup done and I was like what the
am I supposed to do we walk into the
caravan she is passed out naked on the
caravan floor she had had too many
valium and too many lines of cocaine too
much weed and probably a lot of alcohol
so she was passed out on the caravan
floor that was a sight to see at this
point I'm like what the is going on
like just remember I'm freshly 18 like
18 seems like like these days 14 year
olds know everything about everything
and 12 year olds like it's crazy like
times have just changed but I was
especially I changed so I didn't really
know much about anything and when I saw
that I was like holy I want
to call my mom I want to get the
out of here but I didn't I
I kept going eventually she ended up
waking up and she was completely flat
when she woke up so I ended up doing her
makeup as I said before around 6 o'clock
she had missed the reception's that I
had to push the wedding back so after
I'd done her makeup we had to go on a
barge to this place now
I don't like speedboats now there was
some old football player to play a
driving and who was actually can you
shut up he wasn't like oh but he was a
dad and he was hot like his arms
and his thighs I was like oh my god so
he was driving the part and then there
was some other little guy like zipping
around on this arm because it was dark
they couldn't really see and there was
no lots on the part or some Wow
amazing there was some guys that being
in front of them to see if they were
gonna hit anything like the boat sir on
this part there was the guy who was
driving it there was me there was the
bride and there was three bridesmaids no
there was true bridesmaids now the true
bridesmaids oh my god
one of them is actually my friend's mom
shut up one of them is actually my
friend's mom and I have really really
liked her I get along with her but she
was getting into a domestic with the
other bridesmaid that did not like each
other and in the midst of all of this
happening afterwards I had done one of
the bridesmaids makeup and the other
bridesmaids makeup was done they both
got into an argument and started yelling
at each other and there was so much
tension the bridesmaid that is the bad
bridesmaid that no one really likes um
she went snot on a line of cocaine in
the bathroom and came out a completely
different person and was literally being
so rude to me and so rude to the other
bridesmaid even more and not even
talking to the bride and it was just the
biggest show taking you
guys back to the boat scene so we're all
on the boat and we're driving along and
it's about a 10-15 you know minute boat
ride so we're going at speed probably at
like 50 climb at 40 kilometers
I don't really know 20 kata and I will
gone quite fast everything's all good
and then we hit a log in like underneath
the water and the bird whacked into this
log and everything just gars and the
bride's the bride is standing up at the
back because she wanted an amazing
arrival she was standing up at the back
of the boat her heels were digging into
this boat
she literally almost toppled back or
front or something happened so she had
almost toppled the over thank God
she didn't because that would have been
an even bigger
so after we hit this log we're literally
so stuck and by this time it's 11:30 at
night she was meant to be getting
married at 6 o'clock for a sunset
wedding it's 11:30 at night they weren't
gonna get married to the next
day for all their luck so we're all
sitting in this bar thinking what the
 do we do the driver starts
undressing himself and I'm like holy
 I am aroused this bulge is huge his
bulge was massive like it looked
like he had the biggest daddy dick can
you be quiet
bulge was big a dick was poppin balls
were popping holy fires were just
 Mints like an old not old I'm
talking like maybe like 30 years old
like that's all to me or like 40 years
old maybe like 35 maybe 35 40 but he was
a daddy he was hard he looked
like he had money he are in this bar
that didn't have any lights on it all I
went working whatever takes his shirt
off so he's in his briefs and he gets
into the water to try and push this boat
like this is just the most thing
about getting to the water to try and
push this boat off the log so we can get
over cuz we were probably like 20 meters
away from the shore where we had to go
where the reception was and like was by
the river and everything and they
couldn't get the BART off the log we're
all sitting there thinking what the
do we do me and the bridesmaid my
friend's mom that I've got along with
really quite well we were like we are
not getting in this canoe they
started this guy comes over with a canoe
and the bride gets in and takes her it
guys I can't swim there were no
lifejackets canoe to me it was like a
wooden old canoe it was not a fancy
canary like like it looks like it could
hold its together it was literally
a piece of wood that was floating on the
water I'm like I'm not getting
in there and neither is she like
pointing at the other bride saying like
we're not getting in there that
so we were on their set age is like
literally half an hour and the other
annoying bridesmaid that sort of the
liner Kirk who is gone and the bride was
gone like over there getting married
congratulations
me and the other bridesmaid is still
stuck on this boat so she's getting
married because her whole wedding party
has been there for six hours even more
waiting for her to arrive so they
finally get the bird off the log and we
are over and we go to the reception they
finally get married and then as soon as
they get married I'm like in this random
house that was there like on the little
island where they were having it I don't
know when this had happened they had had
so much alcohol and so many valium or
whatever they were taking or cocaine or
weed or anything we were all standing in
the room and they were both in the
bathroom and I looked at the groom the
guy I said are you okay and he just
projectile vomits everywhere not on me
thank because if he did I would
have decked him he projectile vomited
everywhere and then next thing we know
the bride is projectile vomiting
everywhere
what's this sort of wedding is
this guy's I've literally never been in
sorry much shocked before there's more
stuff that happened in there but I just
can't remember because it was so hungry
but they will act the main events that
really got me up like what the
farm anyway I'm so glad I don't have to
take clients anymore because I'm not
dealing with that if you guys
enjoyed this video it makes you give it
a massive thumbs up I love you guys and
I'll see you all in my next video bye
