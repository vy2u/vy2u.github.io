channel so today I'm gonna be doing a
full review on the Tarte shape tape
matte foundation now there is the matte
one or there is the hydrating one I'm
actually what install this off shiny so
I don't actually have my shade of the
hydrating one on but I did order them on
line so I got them Express to Australia
so I should get them in a few days
hopefully but I'm so excited for this
leg this has been so long coming in the
running and ever since
Todd's like shape tech came out pretty
much everyone was like they need to do a
foundation version of this because it's
gonna be so fucking lit
sorry it's finally here I think it came
out yesterday or today well I bought it
today today I'm pretty sure it hit
stores today so I've bought it from
tarts website but anyway I saw this one
of SHINee
so yes I'm gonna give it a whirl and see
what happens
I'm actually really fucking excited
because they're just hard bits like it's
not to the standard of the shape tape
concealer but we're gonna find out so
this is in the shade medium sand it's a
little bit too dark for me but we're
still gonna get the whole gist of the
foundation coverage and what not and I'm
just gonna have to wait until my other
ones come so I've already primed using
the Tarte bright brighterdayz primer
slash moisturizer just what I'd use
something tight because we're using a
Tod foundation who may as well use a
tart primer as well so pretty much this
is what the bottle looks like and you
just unscrew it's like a massive version
of the concealer you unscrew it and it's
got like the exact same applicator as
the concealer which i think is really
cool so it's like staying in the family
of the shape tape you know sir I'm just
gonna go ahead and get started I'm just
gonna pop some on the back of my hand
and just see how this goes
so that's like four insertions on my
hand
and then I'm just gonna take my Beauty
Blender I'm just it is already dead but
I'm just gonna spritz it with some fix+
this is the new Mac one this is in the
scent lavender so it's in like a purple
bottle it's so cute okay I'm just gonna
dip into the foundation for my Beauty
Blender op and here we go
okay so already here I can tell that
this shade is too dark for me however
it's gonna work okay so it's definitely
mat so I'm just going to take the
applicator instead and I'm just going to
pretty much just swipe it like I do with
the shape tape conceal are okay so it's
going to cover that and then go back in
with my booty looking ass
blend it well the coverage is absolutely
phenomenal and a little bit is going a
long way even though I just piled on a
fuck Larry
so far it's a really really nice
coverage it's kind of like a thin
consistency but it does have the
coverage there however I think it's
bringing out a little more texture than
other foundations do on my skin like my
bumps are showing up my bumps a little
bit more just like a little tiny bits of
texture that I've got around my mouth
just gonna keep on soldiering on and
blending this all out I'm just gonna
quickly conceal the tops on my eyebrows
and then I'll be back in a sec okay so
it's currently oxidizing quite a bit
which is normal for any foundation I
guess but as I mentioned at the start
this is definitely not my shade I need
something more lighter less yellow toned
and more pinky turn but we're still
getting the gist of the whole coverage
formulae and all that sort of stuff but
to me this is looking at pretty and done
good so this has covered pretty much
everything on my face super super well
okay what I'm gonna do now is I'm just
going to finish off the rest of my
makeup do my concealer bacon all that
stuff and I'm gonna see how products
pack on top of this and then I'll come
back to you guys with my final thoughts
now I would do a wear test but I hate
leaving makeup one for long periods of
time unless I'm at an event or something
like that but I'm sure a lot of other
people will be doing wear tests but what
I did do is I swatch it on my hand
before and I had on my hand for like
three hours and it oxidized and it dried
down perfectly and I went to wash all
the makeup off my hand like other
foundations I'd swatch and it didn't
come off sorry I feel like it's going to
be very like heavy duty and long wearing
I guess oh it does say double duty
Beauty on the back of it so I'm assuming
yeah alright I'm just gonna go ahead and
do the rest of my makeup and then I will
come back to you guys and let you guys
know my final thoughts on this sound
bang shop
okay guys sorry my makeup is now all
complete and done now for my final
thoughts
it is definitely the maddest foundation
I think I've ever used in my life sorry
if you have a dry
skin completely avoid this on all costs
because it is literally the maddest
foundation I've ever used however they
do have a shape tape hydrating one which
I am yet to try out I bought my shade
online so I should get it really really
soon as I said start but this is what
everything looks like now the way that
product packed onto it was actually
really really nice because it is so Matt
it's pretty much just like a blank
canvas so everything's completely dry
and you can just go straight in with
your contour your bronzers your blushes
and everything like that
and it didn't stick too much it didn't
like it didn't go patchy or anything
like that like I love the look of it
like I think it looks absolutely
flawless I'm just really excited to get
my shade in the mail rather than having
something that isn't my shade but we
still get the gist of the whole look and
the formulae and everything like that
okay so this is what it looks like up
close I thought I just give you guys a
rough look at the up close shot of it
I'm gonna start doing these close shots
because a lot of you asked for it um so
yeah please excuse my really bad lip
application and my eyeshadows
transferred a little bit but will
District go back okay
but yeah to me everything looks really
nice and matte if I ever have a dry skin
day I will not be going near this
foundation and I'm actually really
excited to get my shades in the post
because then I can you know wear it to
event and then I can let you guys know
my thoughts on the long wear and the
longevity of it pretty much yeah anyway
guys this is the end of todays video I
hope you really really enjoyed it I sure
had fun doing this glam and testing out
his foundation because I ignore it has
been super highly requested ever since
it was announced I love you guys so much
and I will see you all in my next video
hey fucking see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
