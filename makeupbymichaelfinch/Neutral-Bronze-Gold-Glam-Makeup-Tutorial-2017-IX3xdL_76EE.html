welcome to the first video of 2016
oh my god I regret doing a voice over
because I need to talk about so much
stuff but who cares so first I'm just
going in with my heart-shaped a
concealer I'm putting that across my
eyes and sending it with a little bit of
translucent powder just to avoid any
creasing whatsoever now I'm taking the
violet Voss Pro palette I'm taking the
color hashtag it's like a nice orange
you sort of color you know I love my
warm tones if you know me you know that
I love my warm tones so I'm just taking
that for my cruise I haven't said that
in a while
met someone at the festival the other
day and they came up to me and there
were like cruise like anyway and then
I'm taking the other like brown color
that I'm kind of going into the cool
tones now and just bring that throughout
my crease as well I want this to be kind
of like an easy tutorial to follow like
I don't want it to be too intense so
that I'm just taking that other darker
color and putting that on the outer V
and kind of blending that out as well
and just defining that a little bit more
and blending it all together and then
just going in with a little bit more of
that dark color and just blending that a
little bit now moving on to my lid color
I'm gonna be taking the shape called
toffee which is this gold color and I
did spread my brush with a little bit of
fix+ and I'm just applying that across
my lid now the lighting does get a
little bit weird here just excuse that
Plews and so I'm just spreading that
across my lid and then just going with
that other little brush to make sure
there's no harsh lines and I'm kind of
just blending out that gold eye shadow
yeah we're back on to lash line now I
was gonna do winged liner but I decided
not to so I just took the black color
from the huda beauty palette and kind of
just smudged it into my lash line
and then took a smaller brush and kind
of blended it out a little bit I guess I
don't really know I'm just so there's
something for the lash band to hiding
because I like putting that down anyway
moving on to the face I'm going in with
this Smashbox photo finish primer and
I'm putting that all over my face and
for foundation we're using the Urban
Decay all nighter foundation in the
shade 3.0 because I'm not fake tan
yes this is a very yellow undertone
foundation but it does oxidize a lot as
you will notice throughout the whole
video you guys know I love my yellow
undertones because I'm counteracting the
pink on my face so I'm not gonna use a
pink undertone foundation because I
don't think it looks good on me and by
the end of it when I'm all contoured and
bronzed and highlighted and concealed it
all comes together in the end so I'm not
really fast so I'm just putting that all
across my forehead and then going in
with my Real Techniques sponge and
making sure that's all blended out into
my hairline because my hair is pink so I
don't want to get too much in my hair
you know what I'm talking about
now going back in with the tight shape
type concealer in the shade light I'm
just putting that on my nose bridge my
forehead and my Cupid's bow and my chin
just to conceal a little bit more and
bring some light back to the face if you
don't insane this concealer is so
amazing if you guys haven't tried it
it's honestly incredible so what's so
good it's just so thick like if you're a
thick coverage for a girl or guy you
need this in your life it's literally so
good some people don't like because it
is too thick but I'm all about that
thick as concealer and I love it so
much now just taking my sponge again and
blending that out to absolute perfection
as you guys can see it blends out sorry
easily and so seamlessly it's not patchy
it basically sets itself you don't even
need to set this concealer but of course
I would anyway so yeah just blending
that ball into the side of my nose and
my nurse does kind of get lost in
concealer because I always put a lot on
so I drew contour that a little bit
afterwards I am just making underneath
my eyes with the cardi s1 powder and I'm
just generously packing that on as you
can see underneath both eyes and then I
drew back the sides of my nose a little
bit too just because I feel like
foundation kind of falls off there
sometimes during the day so I like to
just make sure it's fully set in place
now taking the Australis fresh and
flawless pressed powder I know it's a
new year I'm still using this I know I
know
hopefully I find something that's on the
same level but a different brand so I
can change it up a little bit for
everyone but I'm just dusting that all
over my face just set the rest of my
bounding
so it looks good and it lasts all day
yeah moving on to contoured this is did
shoe faced chocolate soleil it's milk
chocolate Soleil so it's very very good
for the skin color that I have at the
moment because I'm not tan so it's the
perfect call tone not too much not too
orange although I do love my orange
contour when I am very pale but change
it up a little bit you know and just you
know bronzing up my forehead my
cheekbones underneath my jawline and
prepping that already in for contouring
I like to contour after I bronze because
the more powder you put down the better
your contour is gonna blend and my
contour is always a little bit darker so
going from light to dark is always good
it's kind of like eyeshadow when you go
from your transition to your black you
wouldn't start off with your back and
then luck and then in with your
transitions you know I mean so I'm just
contouring the sides of my nose a little
bit with a a little tiny cute brush and
a little bit under my bottom lip to give
the appearance of a big lip not that I
need that anyway let's move on umm
Anastasio Beverly Hills contour kit to
contour today I'm just taking the troop
halt own sort of shades I'm avoiding the
orange one that I always kind of use
because I don't really want to turn
myself Orange for a change you know and
just contouring like my temples you know
what actually went the other day eat
apples aren't meant to be contoured
because there's no actual natural
contour there apparently I don't know I
could be wrong I'm not approached now
we're finished on whoa I don't know what
no we're finished on now a finish oh oh
now we're finishing off underneath my
eyes with a hashtag and then the other
brown color and then the really dark
brown color and then I'm just kind of
smudging that down and blending it all
together my voice overall I love it I
freaking love it so just putting that
all together to make it look nice and
sexual and you know a little flat shader
brush up in there now we're disgusting
off all that bacon cuz we don't want to
leave that there because we get yaki so
I'm just dusting all of that off before
going in with some toothpaste better
than dick mascara oh my god guys I love
this mascara just look at it watch ready
three two one amazing
done boom love love love love love sad
bottom lashes I'm just using the Mac
extended play gigablack lash because
it's the best for bottom lashes you guys
don't have to see knees with less than X
is amazing okay moving on to
lashes these are the hooded beauty in
the styles Sasha number 11 and yep the
lighting was a little bit up
there and it all worked out in the end
so I'm just taking that eyelash on with
the house of lashes black lash glue and
I obviously got it there so what I like
to do is I just wait until it dries and
then I just scratch it off with a
spoolie cuz that's the best way to do it
now moving on to blush this is the hot
mama blush from the balm I don't know
why I'm using this brush to apply it
because that's all I had that was clean
sorry you know work with what you've got
that's what I like to say work with what
you've got so I'm just brushing that
over my cheeks and then for my waterline
today I'm just using the Tarte in a rim
liner to keep my eyes open rather than
sticking a black color in there I wanted
to keep this quiet not too dramatic do
you know what I mean so I'm just putting
that in there and now for my highlight
this is Jeffrey star ice cold but before
that I'm just fixing I'm fixing my face
with a little bit of fixed plaster okay
Michael not a problem and I'm kind of
just blending at that in now this is
probably a little bit too light looking
over this footage for me with the skin
color I should have gone from washer and
painting color but you know you learn as
you go I'm not a pro I'm self-taught so
anyone who's asking so I'm not you know
the best do you know what I mean like I
don't really know my all that well
I just kind of slap it on and hope for
the best and then I'm putting out on the
inner corners of my eyes my nose bridge
keepers blow Cupid's blow okay that's a
Cupid's blur that's the new one thank
you so much let's leave that in the
comments now for my lips let's do
celebrity skin beige a star cosmetics
haven't used this in a hot minute and
then just over the top I'm putting some
dose of colors
sand and blending that together with my
finger to get the perfect nude color
because I think it's just stunning and
just applying a little bit more now to
set my face today I'm just using the
Gerard cosmetics lay all day setting
spray the lavender one and that is the
finished look I hope you guys really
enjoyed this video if you did don't
