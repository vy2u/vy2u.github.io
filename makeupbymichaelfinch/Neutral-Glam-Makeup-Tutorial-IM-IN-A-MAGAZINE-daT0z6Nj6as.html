today I'm gonna be filming like a makeup
tutorial not get rid of me because I
just so many of them so I'm gonna try
and stick to you notice the makeup it's
kind of a get ready with me but aren't
all tutorials like you're getting ready
for something so who cares
basically today what I'm going to be
doing is just very very neutral not
natural in no way my natural ever so I'm
just going to do something quiet neutral
and yeah let's just get straight into
I've got some new products I want to try
it on myself okay so for my eyebrows I'm
kind of obsessed with mixing two pomades
together by anastasiya because if I just
use chocolate it's too dark so I kind of
mix it together in the pan and then just
you know wipe it on my face so I just
kind of mix them together in the little
pot finger basically what I'm doing is
just following my actual brow and then
just making it a bit bigger
so I just watched um Jeffrey stars of
many mu A's what's in my mouth challenge
I died
I love seeing youtubers like not just
like the top of their head like I love
seeing more of that like it's so it just
I don't know it's just so cool so I
really want to do the challenge with
Alex next week because I'm going to go
to Alex doesn't see her do you guys
think we should do it because I really
want to do it and I would her up I
have seriously hate doing my eyebrows
and a story I have doing them I hate it
I hear ok so now we're going to move on
to the skin and before I get started on
the skin because it is getting into the
cold weather I have a pimple rude I just
want to spread to my face a little bit
with Mac prep and prime everyone's
probably that way doing that you have
other skin
 off I can do what I want so I'm
just taking a few squirts at there maybe
like 5 but that doesn't matter he needs
to just off what is it doing make
up your mind you got now are you going
this way on back he gone for what are
you doing darling hopefully it behaves
itself when it's on this side you know
so if the skin today I was going to be
going back to my all-time favorite
benefit Porefessional
it fills in all those big-ass ugly
looking pores and I dropped it again oh
 my life for foundation today I'm
going to be going back to my all-time
favorite Arbonne foundation this is in
the shade honey beige and I'm going to
be taking my authentic Beauty Blender
yes I mean we need to get one of these
for so long and I finally got one I
don't know if I've already said that in
video but I'm best choice I ever made in
my life so I'm more or less just going
to be like stippling that on also in
many videos before like I feel like when
you press product into your skin it like
rather than just moving it around on the
surface when you press it in it lasts
longer I don't know why I just feel like
it does okay I'm just going to be
sweeping a little bit of that over my
eyelids as you can see I'm not even
going to conceal you know
my brows today I'm going for that whole
neutral sort of look do you not I mean
like not too much
let's move this hair back and do this
side at this big forehead feel
like I've all got product on my forehead
rather than anywhere else because well
my boy so big leaving basically
saying love this foundation literally
obsessed oh yeah see you later
say that they didn't want to say that is
one to fall again so yeah now
I'm gonna be taking my Chanel 10 de
Soleil and this doesn't show up very
well on my skin but I feel I can give me
a guideline where I'm gonna like contour
a little bit plus Kylie Jenner is so
it's all good well actually it does kind
of work you know I'm not using it as a
bronzer it's meant to be like a liquid
sort of bronzer contour sort of thing
I'll take more of a conjurer so I'm
sorry taking my Mac Pro Longwear
concealer this is in the shade NW 15 so
it's quite white there's gonna be
painting up underneath my eyes just me
back to the Beauty Blender I was gonna
get a bit of mac's fix+
spritz spray spray you know get a little
sprayed up give it a little bit of a
sweet - no more through that area
and now I'm just gonna start blending
that out I'm about a love makeup today
you know how you have those really good
days Mac but then you have the days
I play so give me one of the good days
everyone's probably thinking why are you
doing you taste her she never do face
first now because I'm doing basically
nothing to my lives I put a photo on
Instagram the other night no and it
was just like me with like my you know
make up for the night and it was
basically nothing like but everyone was
like can you do a tutorial and I was
like ok so here it is um this is the
tutorial for that specific look now I'm
going to take this Gerard cosmetics BB +
illumination facial cream I've never
used yeah let's go on again bat okay so
this is like a liquid illuminator sort
of thing and I was going to squirt a
little bit onto the back of my hand
Beauty Blender it oh should I be
using a Beauty Blender okay I'll use
this side of the Beauty Blender and what
I'm gonna do is just shove it on there
is perfect where I would normally
highlight I don't know if this is going
to make a difference because I don't
really use illuminators and I don't
really know how to use illuminator so
I'm just putting the way I think you
know it's going to accentuate that
highlight a little bit more because we
all know I love as strong as haha okay
now we're going to go back to our Beauty
Blender and I'm just going to blend
under those eyes
actually no I'm gonna get my powder
first this is like such a quick process
you've got to do well with me cuz my
eyes crease really badly let me just get
my hair spun croce face powder out
literally my favorite thing if I like
dude I cannot ease it down so much
Patrick's taffeta like every worked out
this for the past five and a half years
I'm obsessed so basically what I do is
I'm just blending under my eyes okay
both eyes and then I go straight in with
a ton of product and just do it's
kind of a baked I guess it's probably
pointless using that illuminating stuff
because I probably just covered it all
up and I honestly don't care I don't
even know what it is like I don't even
know why I've got it then I'm just
taking the curry powder and join the
rest of my face I would normally use a
powder foundation but I feel like I
don't need any more coverage and I don't
want to go to full coverage because
otherwise I'm just not like a rooted
sheet guys nobody really knows this but
I did actually get some Botox in between
my eyebrows here like two three weeks
ago so when I frown like I can't there's
no lines at all I love it
I wanna be Botox top people probably are
like thinking while you're getting Botox
you're 19 maybe I can do what I want
it's my body and you can do the same if
you don't want Botox then don't get it
okay no one's going to move on to the
rest of the face I'm going to be taking
my Mac give me Sun
bronze up good morning so I'm just
taking that on a brush and I'm just
going to be warming up the face this is
my favorite contouring / bronzing brush
everyone's like why using that to
contour and bronze when it's a oh it's
just a medium face brush so I guess I
can do it for whatever I want this is
from EXO Beauty this is from the old EXO
Beauty range is a new one now which I
still need to get my hands on but um I'm
just using this this is my favorite I've
got like four of them I use them for
clients and everything to contour and
bronze like I just feel like it's the
best one
that I found so far so I feel like when
you put down a bronzer before you
contour it blends better like I feel
like the more powder I'm just going to
run a tiniest bit under my jawline I was
going to run a little bit down the side
of my nose with this little brush over
here this is the XIV eyeshadow blender
and apparently Imagi contour your nose
with cooler tones but thought that I
like it like this I'll slowly learn and
I'll probably end up changing my ways
and listen to everyone one day but for
now I like the way I do everything on
this mug honest idea Beverly heels and
I'm just gonna be taking it this these
two and I'm just gonna start you know
lightly contouring my face well this
isn't lightly okay let's be real it's
not lightly never supposed to flat
contour but now we go really harsh less
is more
under here that don't agree let's
give us a chin or something going on so
I'm just gonna start contouring under my
normal chin the first one not the second
one all of that and I'm going to start
poking up my jawline if I can find it
amongst all this fat I've
eaten so much Kosir this week it's been
ridiculous I've actually eaten too much
Hennessy my whole lifetime but at the
whole new-media who can absolutely go
back to my eyeshadow blender brush and
get the gray color the cool tone I don't
know what it's called like that and I'm
just going to be intensifying that nose
contour ever so slightly
let's do blush I'm going to be taking my
NARS angelic our new favorite blush
obsessed it's like pink but not pink but
pink but sly subtle whatever the word is
called same brush that I use to contour
because it's all going to be wedding
together anyway I'm just going to be
smiling off my thing and just brushing
that on forwards now what I'm gonna do
is just get my Beauty Blender again with
some color and just run over my nose
contour I just like blend it a little
bit more vacuum leave give me son I'm
just gonna be running that through my
eye crease off with creased a lot
instead her whoops-a-daisy sorry Mac
Kimmy son back onto that eyeshadow
blender brush and I'm just going to be
running that through my entire craze
just because I feel like if I put
nothing on my eyelids I look so I just
look dead to the world like I just look
like I've been just put in a coffin not
put at all so I'm gonna be taking
Becca's champagne pot that's what she
looks like
play or swim Instagram right now groans
one of my phone what am I saying stop it
Mike we being silly
go stand outside Mike we being rude keep
it's Bo pop this severely ready ah
tip of the nose I'm not taking any extra
product I'm just taking what's on there
sorry the bridge but I'm getting my
finger and just doing a little something
right on the tip okay and then I'm just
going to blend it down so I'm just going
to sweep that away back in with Becca
champagne pop I'm just going to take a
little bit of it on a small brush and
highlight my inner corners now I really
should be getting the foundation off my
lips but she can't be tarte
lipsurgence matte lip tint in the color
Envy I haven't used this before Sephora
sent it to me so let's get this on
actually kind of like that like it's
very I don't want to do a liquid
lipstick today sorry and then I'm taking
a Dallas benefits gloss mascara today
I'm just gonna be using benefits of
roller lash and I'm only gonna be
putting this on my top lashes I'm
keeping the bottom completely clean now
for lashes today I was going to be using
ones from House of lashes these are
called temptress I believe okay guys
we're pretty much done I'm just gonna be
setting my face with the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray oil free come
through and fray
and then because want to be a little bit
chewy today I'm going to be taking my
mac fix+
covering my t-zone and just doing my
cheek areas because I tend to get really
oily here but you know Yolo it's just
gonna make your highlight pop a little
bit more severely okay guys so this is
