today's video is a little collaboration
with my really good friend here makeup
by jaw so I'll be leaving all her links
down below now my brows already done
surprise surprise let's get straight
into the eyes I'm just going to be using
the Kat Von D lock-it concealer and just
applying that as a base and then
blending that out with my Real
Techniques sponge making sure that's all
blended out and then just taking a
little bit of translucent powder and
just setting of my lids now for my
eyeshadow i'm using the morphe 35c
palette and we're going for like some
Purple's today just a little bit of
purple and I'm gonna be putting that for
my crease and kind of just packing on
the color
I feel like purple is one of the hardest
colors to work with sometimes it just
might not blend a micro patchy like I
feel like Purple's a really hard color
for some companies to make unless you
sugar pill umm but yeah then I'm just
packing on a darker color into my outer
V and blending that out with the color
that I used before that and just going
backwards and forwards until it's all
blended out until it looks okay I
propria
I don't know what I was going to say
then just going with a bit of black on
the outer V and just blending that into
the outer V okay and then just going
back in with that darker purple again
and blending that out now this glitter
is from glitter injections I don't know
what it's called but I leave it down
below my camera was blurry the whole
time I was putting glitter on hence why
there was that really short clip now
same thing happened with my eyeliner I
use the Inglot gel liner and see I'm out
of the frame biased thing I didn't even
want to be in the frame anyway this just
happens guys it just happens sometimes I
don't realize and I got none of my
highlighter on camera whoops
and I'm just cleaning that up then I
just went and did the other eye now
moving on to lashes these are Lily
lashes in caviar and I'm just taking
those babies on these are so pretty
these lashes guys like this so stunning
love look at that
BAM straight on now for primer I'm just
using the Bobbi Brown vitamin and rich
face space and for my foundation this is
the Milani can steal and perfect this
foundation in my opinion is so freakin
good it is really high coverage like
just watch just watch just watch just
watch I don't know how it wears
throughout the day cuz I only had this
one for a few hours but um it's got
really good coverage like
look at that in my opinion that's really
like full coverage so I'm just blending
that into my skin with that sponge
making sure it's all blended out and oh
my god I'm actually not fake tan sorry
people and friggin reddit and guru
gossip are gonna love that I'm
using something that isn't a tan color
Oh
get and then I'm just putting the
concealer on my chin above my lip my
nose and also my forehead and just
blending that out and then I'm going
straight in with that same concealer
under my eyes and making sure that's all
blended out seamlessly so you can't tell
where it starts and ends I love blending
out concealer it's so much fun it just
changes the whole entire look if I
didn't use concealer under my eyes I
don't know what I would do with my life
I love it so much now just going back to
my favorite translucent powder this is
your ima inner color powder everyone
asked me like why do you keep using that
like change not change it up Y fixed if
it's broke I can't go past this powder
sorry guys you're gonna see it for the
rest of my life and then just sending
the rest of my foundation with the NAS
press powder in beach on a really dense
brush so I can really pack that product
in there and set that foundation guys
I'm really impressed with this Milani
foundation so very good from what I can
tell I didn't leave it on for that long
but I'll let you know again if it stays
during the day or whatever and then just
doing under my eyes as you can see
pretty self-explanatory
and just putting a little bit of brown
onto there because I felt like it don't
know if it ruin the look or if it made
it you guys leave me a comment down
below and tell me if that Brown the
whole look up or if it made it better
and then just putting a little bit of
glitter on my inner corners and then
just using a bit of little bit of Marc
Jacobs mascara under my eyes then to
contour I'm using the Revlon Chloe
Morello collaborations top to the
highlighting kit I'm just taking the
bronze shade and bronzing up my face a
little bit and then I'm on my god be
quiet and then I am contouring with the
contour shade and yet just going
straight in for as you can see creating
a jawline there trying to make my
forehead look a little bit small like so
 big as we all know then for
blush I'm just using the trail of blush
by Tarte and I pack the out of this
on
like blast looks really good with purple
eyeshadow like pink and purple it just
matches really well I don't know if
maybe it's just me
yeah I'm rambling now I'm just using the
Too Faced candlelight highlight I'm not
really a big fan of this but it's a very
subtle highlight so it is nice you can
shove it all over your whole face and
you won't look too crazy as you can see
it's a very subtle highlight so I sound
like a radio station today just can't
get me together anyway then I'm
just putting that basically all over my
face just to make myself glow a little
bit more and then I'm using this Stila
caramello liquid lipstick waiting for
that to dry and then going straight over
the top with the nozzle it blush blush
in Turkish Delight and making my lips
look all glossy and setting my face
with the drug cosmetics light all day
that was really intense that movie
wasn't it anyway guys I hope you enjoyed
