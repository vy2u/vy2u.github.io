channel so today's video is going to be
my favorite products that I literally
cannot live without so I'm going to
going through all of my favorite
products not all of my favorite products
but stuff that just like I just can't
imagine life without you know how those
those products that you just can't live
with that and if they got taken away
from you'd be like what I do before
I get into today's video I just want to
let you guys know that this video is
sponsored by white with style so why
would style is just a teeth whitening
company that I happen to use so we all
know that there is a million teeth
whitening companies out there and you
know there's some that do work and
there's some that don't work so this is
one of those ones that actually does
work so the way I use it is a pretty
straightforward so basically your kid
will come with a LED light here that
will go over your teeth it comes with
two mouth guards that you can mold to
your own mouth shape it's got all the
instructions in the package that you get
and then it's got the teeth whitening
gel which is what you put on your teeth
and literally because you don't see how
white my teeth are right now like by
also if anyone asking this kit is vegan
it is cruelty free it is also gluten
free yes so basically all I do is I put
the mouse the gel on so I put this all
over my teeth I always like to brush my
teeth and floss them first and then I'll
put this on and then I'll put the two
top and bottom mouth guards in and then
I pop this in and sit like this for
around 30 minutes but even just after
the first time you actually see results
which is so good because I hate waiting
to things I'm one of those people that's
like I need it done now pronto I need it
done now like literally when I moved in
I was like I need everything done today
like I want to be Kris Jenner I need to
move into a new house in one whole day
and have almost together by the way
guys I also do have a discount code it
is Finch 28 I will also leave it on the
screen here and I will leave the website
link down below for anyone who's
interested when you use my courage since
28 it gives you 90 percent of the kits
which is cool so that brings it down to
$28 okay let's get into all of my
favorite clothes
okay so the first product that I want to
talk about is very new in the whole
makeup world it has only just come out
but I can already tell that I'm going to
reach for this palette a lot this is the
Jaclyn hill multi collaboration now when
I first started using multi shadows I
did not like them and then I picked them
up probably a year later and I was like
oh my god these are actually good like
why did I not like them I don't know why
I didn't like them to begin with but
then I fell in love with them and this
palette is actually amazing like if you
don't have this you need to get your
hands on it like it is so different from
all of the other morphe eyeshadow
palettes and I'm pretty sure Jacqueline
did say that on her channel that it is a
different formula from the rest of the
morphe shadows and I think that these
shadows in here all different formulas
as well or there's like little groups
with different formulas in them to suit
the shadow but yeah I'm literally
obsessed with it it's got so many
different color ranges and I'm actually
wearing it on my eyes right now and if
you guys do want to see a three in one
palette looks or like three makeup looks
in one video using this palette or and
even let me know down below because I
feel like that would be really cool
the next thing that I cannot live
without is my aura highlighters now you
guys know if you've been following me
for a while but my Holy Grail
highlighters are they are so buttery
they blend on the skin so well and of
course obviously it's a highlighter it
has to be super super pigmented and they
are so pigmented and it also so
buildable god I'm just like riding over
Czar's but honest to god this palette
here has all my favorite highlighters in
it right there Drive list for our
Beverly Hills and it's got three
bronzers as well but I'm just talking
about the highlighters today I also do
love the bronzers but the highlighters
are so so good this one is probably my
favorite here this is called Beverly
Hills I used to call it on a staff to
have doubles by accident but it's just
bad alike health you know if you haven't
tried them you need to try them that's
all I can say it's like they're amazing
I'm wearing it now also putting on the
next thing I cannot live without and I'm
sure you guys are sick of seeing it on
my channel this is the hyouta Beauty
textured rose gold eyeshadow palette I'm
just going to quickly talk about this
for a second because I'm sure you guys
are over me riding here to beauty's
asshole basically this is a matte and
shimmery shade palette I love this the
matte shades in here they're so so so
good
the black eyeshadow is also such a great
formula it doesn't blend your other
colors away and where you apply it and
blend it it stays and it doesn't like
spread too much to not I mean like black
eyeshadows are really hard to find a
good black eyeshadows are really hard to
find I mean the only thing I don't like
about this palette and I actually do not
ever use them is these ones across the
top here because you literally have to
apply them with your finger and it's
just very inconvenient when you've got
ugly french tips on like it's just not
convenient at all they don't pick up
well with a brush but honestly I live
for the matte shades and these are that
good that these ship ones up here make
up for the good ones down the bottom you
know the next thing I cannot live with
that is the Marc Jacobs Omega one or two
tantric bronzer this bronzer
girl let me tell you I use this in so so
so so many videos it is just so smooth
and so blendable and it's not true
orange but it's a little bit orange so
it's like low-key Mac give me Sun but
like nowhere near as orange which is
exactly what I want because I love Mac
give me Sun and I feel like this is just
perfect it's just surprising and the
packaging is so sleek and like bougie
and I'm obsessed the next thing that I
cannot live without is my favorite
ultimate liquid lipstick Brandes out
from this are from these are from a
Jeffrey store cosmetics Allah and I
literally have so many of them my
favorites are mannequin celebrity skin
I'm nude I occasionally use that but the
one that I reached where I used to be
obsessed at celebrity skin but mannequin
kind of stole it but I know who just
came out with a new one in the summer
collection called hunty which I do need
to get my hands on cause it's like a
warm toned liquid lipstick and I love a
warm tone the good lipsticks are amazing
they're beautiful and they really
complement my eye color
apparently that's what I've been told
but yeah I just love the formula I love
the way they smell a lot of people so
that they hate the way that they smell
but honestly I love them they smell like
root beer and some of them smell what's
under smell I don't know I love the root
beer smell oh it's just so nice and like
refreshing I don't know it's pretty but
yes I'm definitely never running out of
these because I buy them occasionally
when they're like back in stock or it's
like like when they are in stock I'll
just go and buy them because I hate
running out of them so yeah the next
makeup products that I'd literally
cannot live without is the tarte
cosmetics blushes now I am rich
the obsessed with the tarte cosmetics
blushes my favorite one that I always
use is captivating because it's kind of
like Melba by Mac like it's a blush that
goes with any single look it's much of
pink of up to oranges just in between
and it's so buildable all their blushes
are buildable and their Amazonian clay
meaning like they're like 12 our lasting
blushes because I know a lot of blushes
on the market these days you put them on
and they wear off during the day and you
can't see them at all because they just
wear off so these are very long wearing
12 hours and I'm literally obsessed I'm
wearing it now - you are wearing
captivating right now the next thing I
want to talk about is the market Jacobs
remarkable foundation now I have gone
through so many stages of finding new
favorite foundations and whatnot I have
different combinations that I like to
mix up all the time but to be honest if
I had to choose one foundation that I
had to use for the rest of my life it
100% bees in my check is remarkable I've
not used it in such a long time and I
just used it before in a video that I
feel with my friend and I mean it's
literally football it's like it is just
so so nice the only downfall about it is
it's quite thick so I'm it can really
get in your smile lines occasionally um
so I need to kind of avoid using it
around here and just blend it out a
little bit more because it does stick
into your smile line but other than that
it is full coverage it is a very very
very very very good for oily skin
because it is so Matt and drying so
probably not as the best for dry skin
types because it might make you too dry
but um yeah very good for oily skin
which I have and that's why I'm so
obsessed with it the next thing that I
cannot live without is the giraffe
cosmetics slay or day setting sprays
these honestly are just that good I
don't know why I think it's because
their main ingredient is alcohol and
alcohol makes everything stay in place
and it makes everything stay on so there
are a lot of settings products on the
market as we all know because I do have
a whole drawer full of them I feel like
the more alcohol that is in them the
better they work but apparently alcohol
is not good for your skin so that's also
another thing but in saying that Botox
can fix that and I'm literally just
obsessed like it literally does keep
your makeup on and I've got the shades
flavors green tea flashes ginger which
is the green one
the purple one is lavender and the
orange one is peach which is my favorite
they smell like the names as well like
lavender and green tea ginger and peach
hmm oh my god that one is that that it
smells like literal Lipton iced PHT if
you haven't had that before what are you
doing oh it tastes like teachers as well
that's amazing
the next thing I cannot live with that
is the Cody as fun powder now I have
been at switching on my paddles a lot
lately because I don't like using the
same pattern in literally every single
video like I always do like I've been
through the ICMA I've been through the
the mayor on one the dermablend one but
if I had to choose one it would
definitely be the Cody s gunpowder it's
never let me down it is never ever ever
let me down up with always asking I know
a lot of you ask it is the translucent
extra coverage this is the one that I
use it's translucent but it's got like a
little bit of warmth to it so it does
add a bit of extra coverage as you're
baking or setting or whatnot and it's
super cheap super cheap in America I
think it's six dollars but when you buy
it online because I'm from Australia it
cost like 20 to 30 dollars plus shipping
so it's been annoying but if I ever go
well if I ever go to America when I go
to America in September I'm going to
stop the up on these so yeah the
next thing I cannot live with that is my
benefit roller lash mascara this has
never ever ever ever let me down there
were so many mascaras out on the market
these days I went through a phase of
loving the benefit they're real I went
through a phase of loving the true face
better than dick
mascara but if I had to choose one it
would probably be this it does actually
stay up to its name it literally does
roll your lashes and that's what I love
about it so much and also it thickens
them it doesn't make them look too
spidery and I'm just literally obsessed
now I thought I'd put this in because I
never really talked about it I literally
cannot live without the halves of lashes
black lash glue this glue I have loved
for years now and I do have like 12 of
them in my Alex drawers next to me and
they do also have a clear glue as well
it's latex free so basically that means
that it dries super super quick so
things like jeweler and lash blues with
a lot of latex and then they take ages
to dry you know he really likes it at
they're like 10 minutes give it like 30
to 40 seconds and it will be
ackee and it just very straight on and
it does not move it does not come off a
lot of you been asking me where I get
this from I get it from the House of
lashes website I think it's $12 $12 or
$8 I'm not sure but it's that good next
thing is the benefit Porefessional if
you literally said to me what is your
favorite primer in the world I would say
benefit Porefessional now I do change up
my primers a lot because I am a youtuber
and if I use the same makeup product in
every single video people would be bored
shitless that's why I changed up my
makeup products so much but if I was
asked watch favorite benefit
professional just amazing it fills in
all those little lines all these little
pores all that unnecessary tips needs to
be covered up and it makes your skin
that literally look flawless and it
makes foundation application a lot
better as well and last but not least I
bet you're all sugar thinking where
is the heart-shaped egg here it is bitch
I cannot live without this it is so so
so good if someone took this off me and
stole all my touch tape tapes I would be
screwed and I would not know what to do
with my life I would not know to do with
my life I would be done for I'd be
actually done for this is in the shade
sad beige and I do use another one I
don't know what shade is called but the
one that I use the most is called fair
beige is just
it's not even beige especially ghostly
Casper the ghost white like does that
look beige to you no it's full coverage
it doesn't go take E it blends out so
well it doesn't feel like you've got a
lot of concealer on it's quite
lightweight in my opinion and I just
love it okay guys so that's all I have
time for today I hope you enjoyed this
video and I hope you found some new
products that you want to try out
because I live for all these products
that I spoke about today I love you guys
start sucking much and I will see you
all in my next video bye see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
