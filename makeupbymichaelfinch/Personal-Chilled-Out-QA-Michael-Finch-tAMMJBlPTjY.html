so today I'm going to be doing a
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A the last time chat Q&amp;amp;A that
I did is on private because someone sent
me in snapchat saying that they didn't
give me permission to put them in my
video and then they threatened legal
action against me so make sure if you
ever send me a snapchat makes sure that
you wanted to be in the video because
there is a very high chance that it will
be in the video but yeah that's all I'll
say about that so let's get straight
into the questions if you guys don't
have me on snapchat I will leave it down
below or on the screen right now so make
sure you add me let's get into it just
before I start I know people will ask
what's on my lips is the huda beauty a
lip liner in trendsetter and the huda
beauty liquid matte lipstick in the
shade of a Ness there you go
okay let's get into the question so the
first one is I love you like this Oreo
thank you I love you way more than that
Oreo who asked you a question I just
wanted to say that I love you too that's
cute what was the first Mac products
that you use um the first Mac product
that I used was the pressed powder and
that was a long long long time ago my
snapchat name is Michael Webb Mac but I
never even owned a Mac products how
funny is that anyway
Australia where would you want to live
by the way love your videos thank you
if I could live anywhere other than
Australia I would probably live in
America I feel like America is just for
me I've never been there before I
haven't even been overseas but I feel
like America is just me me me me me oh
well what is your favorite foundation
animal so do you love my brows my
favorite foundation and yes I do love
your brows they were very like naturally
on fleek my favorite foundation ever is
the Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation
the pigmentation is just so good and I
literally just bought like well I was
meant to get like eight or
there are stocks that I refunded me and
there they sent me four so I'm not too
sure because I want the video are you
saying big a copy yeah yes I will be at
IMATS this year I'll be there on
hopefully no I will be there on Sunday
and yeah coming us from India a video of
me so many coming out I will 100% do it
so I'll be there I'll see you there babe
me and Charlie what's our favorite thing
to do together honestly we just like veg
out and do nothing majority of the time
like when we hang out we're just kind of
like like we do fun stuff obviously but
we just kind of veg around like do
nothing hang out with bmd um I eat food
there's like heaps of food shops um
where she is so I just kind of like eat
the whole place while I'm there and um
dad we just kind of hang out and talk
 into nothing my question is now
that shining star brand watches do you
think that you would collab with it
because she's got her watch brand out
would I ever collab with her probably
not but I did say to her as a joke one
day can you come out with a limited
edition like bindi watches like as a
joke because I think that would be so
funny and like when it hits 12 o'clock
it should like sing out come in would
you rather give up sex or make up will
hunt how can I give up dick how can
I give up makeup look I can't even
answer that I'm sorry just can't do it
I have no idea I think she's like a
Maltese and go look I'm really bad with
like brand names of dogs is it called a
brand or a habitat I don't know I'm
sorry done when it comes to that stuff
so yeah
Oh
what do I think that I'll be doing in
ten years I would definitely not be
living where I am right now I plan to
move to Brisbane or something next year
I don't know just wherever the world
takes me I'm just going to go with it
and hope for the best it's fun if I
could bring out any makeup product what
would it be I would probably bring out
my own brand of lashes I know like
that's like the most cliche thing to do
but lashes or liquid lipstick would be
my thing but honestly if I was to bring
out something I would have to be a
hundred percent in love with it I would
have to love the formula because I would
never put my name on anything that I
don't like do you know I mean like I
would have to because I'm such a makeup
lover and I judge like so much makeup
like on the daily if I didn't like
something that I wouldn't put it out so
I would have to be a hundred percent in
love with every little thing to do with
it to put my name on it so I prefer the
GC or the Albion well I hate the
Albion for those who don't know it's
like a club me me like where I live I'm
sorry there's the Grand Central or the
Albion I don't really like the hobby and
it's kind of like a boring I'm like down
the GC is where I like to go because
it's just like so much better there's
like 2d floors the hell Venus is like
one we're gonna flood oh what's the
point but yeah I'm all about that JC
laughs I really need to go there again I
miss going out there
what she said that she's always at work
with her friend Callie and they say to
customers so now when I used to say sue
I when I was at work I'd be like I just
had two things at work when I got in
trouble for you say are you right like
two customers like you lie and you write
that paragraph really rude I never said
see ya because I wasn't saying see you
then but if I was to work in the
hospitality ever again which is not
gonna happen I'd be like well well I'm
can you imagine my boss be like what the
 by how many siblings do I have so
I've got one others are home with me and
then I've got my dad's been married
twice sois so um there's I've got like
four stepsisters three sets are three
stepsisters and the stepbrother but
they're like married with kids and they
like all live away now one would you
rather have to ten times a day for
the rest of your life Oh would you
rather be constipated for the rest of
your life I mean let me know I'll rather
 10 times a day for the rest of my
life cuz being constipated down
your videos are great stuff you love you
know I have not had my wisdom teeth out
but I I can like see them like coming
through and I'm so scared but when they
actually do because I'm gonna start
 everywhere because I know it's
gonna be really painful and I've seen
all the videos of people like high off
morphine like saying stupid so love
it I love it
very cute good luck with your formal day
my goal if there's three we believe in
collab with my famous who would it be

collab with anyone on YouTube I would
want it to be either like Jeffery or
Patrick you know yeah oh it oh I

like bindi well I don't want to look
exactly like bindi but I do want a dog
that is cute and small and very human

emotional feelings towards you you know
