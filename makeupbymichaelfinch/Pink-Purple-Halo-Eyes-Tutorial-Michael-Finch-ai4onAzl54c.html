sorry today we're going to be doing a
pink and purple smokey eye starting
often just going to be splitting my face
with a little bit of mac fix+ just to
hydrate and assure that the dry patches
don't come through as much for
foundation I'm mixing Mable matte and
poreless and some cover affixed now the
cover FX drops what was gave this
foundation all the coverage that made no
sense but um yes I wish the Maybelline
was this high coverage but it's not it
was the cover drops that made it all
good you know what I mean but I just
tried to incorporate a drugstore product
there if that worked anyway I'm just
basically painting that all over my face
as you can see it's quite yellow but
don't worry it works out by the end
now I'm taking a damp beauty blender and
I'm starting to blend out all that
foundation to assure that there is no
brushstrokes or any of that historical
 wank that nobody needs in a
foundation basically I'm just blending
it out
as you can see blending and blending and
blending and don't forget to blend into
your hairline I think I kind of didn't
blend it into my hairline as much as I
should but I will concealer today we're
using the Mac Pro Longwear concealer to
highlight and I'm just applying that
with a synthetic brush under my eyes and
the
I'm also just taking that concealer
across my eyelids to act as a base for
my eye shadow then I'm going to going
straight in with my damp Beauty Blender
once again and blending that right out
now to set my under eyes today I'm using
the RCM a no color powder and I got sent
these brushes from stick mothers from
their new strobing collection so this is
meant to be a baking brush fit under
your eyes it's kind of messy to use but
it wasn't the worst brush like it's
actually not that bad and if you don't
want to use your Beauty Blender and get
all powder in it then that's the brush
for you but I'm just setting my eyelids
as well and that I'm sending the rest of
my foundation with your stylist fresh
and flawless also all shades and all
product details will be listed down
below used in order now for my eyes
today I'm using the Jeffrey star beauty
killer palette and I'm taking the color
star power now I'm not really using a
transition this is going to be the
transition so might be a little bit
scary to some people but to me I just
kind of hope for the best and hope that
it all works out in the end basically
this whole look is going backwards and
forwards backwards and forwards
backwards and forwards with different
brushes and different colors so you can
pack on the pigment without spreading it
too far because the whole point of a
halo wise to have to a darker inner
corner and a darker outer corner and
kind of nothing in the middle because
you want to leave that for the shimmery
color so as you can see I'm just
swapping brushes and going backwards and
forwards windshield wiper motions with
that pink color
three-two-one the color is
the lighting up on being
completely and I was pierced but did
notice until I started editing anyway
I'm taking a combination of fashion
addict and Motown from makeup geek and
I'm packing that into my inner corner
and my outer corner I'm just packing on
the color because that's what the halo
Way is all about leaving the middle
clear and the two sides full of color as
you can see I've just gone back in with
that blending brush with the pink on it
just to blend that out now moving on to
the lid color I'm taking princess from
the Geoffrey star beauty killer palette
and I did also spritz my brush with a
little bit of fixed blasters to assure
the pigment came out a little bit more
sorry but I should have came out a
little bit more pigmented can't
talk today so now I'm going to be taking
the glitter injections highlighter this
is just to basically a glitter
highlighter but I'm using on my eye and
putting that across I didn't use any
glitter glue or anything because the
product is quite sticky so I just threw
it on the middle and done now I'm
basically just taking combination of
motown and fashion addict on the outer
corner in the inner corner underneath my
eye and blending that out with the pink
shade that I use first of all and I'm
leaving the middle parts like pretty
much clean because I do want to put a
bit more princess there just to like
give the halo effect under the eye as
well now I'm taking the Maybelline
studio gel liner and I'm just kind of
putting a little bit of a line across my
lash line just so there's something for
the lashes to kind of blend into I'm
trying to keep it as thin as possible it
was so hard for me to not do a wing like
it's so hard when I joined your wing cuz
I love my wings but I cut out the wings
today now I'm moving on to mascara I'm
just doing the Too Faced better than sex
and yeah you know popping that on
there's that little mascara face going
on oh there it is so now my lashes are
by l'amour mink lashes I'll leave the
brand and the style down below as I
don't remember what they exactly are
right at this current moment in time I
was I'm just putting her his lashes on
and yeah then I'm using on true bottom
of sky this is a Mac extended play
gigablack lash mascara you've probably
seen me use this
in all of my videos because he's
literally amazing now to contour I'm
using the chocolate soleil bronzer in
the shade deep tan to kind of bronze up
my face a little bit because I am going
to be going in with a contour powder
afterwards this is just kind of giving a
little bit more color back to my face
bronze it up bitch bronze it up runs up
mother edge so I'm just bronzing
everything my forehead my cheeks under
my lip basically everything that I am
contouring my nose but that's a whole
new video literally do I forget to
continue Joel Mynor bronzer whatever I'm
 doing that I'm taking the Afra
banana powder and this is just going to
highlight underneath my eyes a little
bit more and I love the effect that this
gives it's so nice it's not too yellow
which is good but I'm just dusting away
any excess powder in case there is any
left over that I want to get rid of and
I don't want flashing back in photos now
I'm using the makeup geek contour art
shade half-hearted just to contour a
little bit more just cuz I felt like I
needed that extra contour because of my
face shape you know round
now this highlighter is amazing
this is Ofra Beverly Hills it is reminds
me of like Lima stuff I was called out
how to start up every Hills I might not
just call Beverly Hills
it is amazing look at it it is so creamy
and so easy to work with I'm having a
little boogie and don't know what I was
dancing to but I can't not do my makeup
without listening to music sometimes I
don't know I'm just putting out on my
Cupid's bow and also on my nose now for
my lip color today I'm using it was out
of candy coke shake a I think was candy
K from Kylie cosmetics and I'm just
applying that all over my lips yeah it
looks really red for some reason I don't
know is this meant to be the color I
don't know I think so anyway I'm just
using that lip liner that goes with that
to line my lips a little bit more then
I'm just taking a lip gloss from
colour-pop and I don't know what the
shade was cool but I'll leave it in the
description below as always and I'm just
putting a little bit of gloss over
because I wanted gloss and I kind of
regret it now I probably would have
liked matte lips more then I'm just
setting my face with a dry cosmetics
slate all day in the shade green tea and
a little bit of fixed place just on my
highlighted areas to make them pop a
little bit more that is basically
everything I hope you guys enjoyed this
