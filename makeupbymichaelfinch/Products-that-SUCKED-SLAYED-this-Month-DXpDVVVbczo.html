channel so today's video I'm gonna be
doing my hits and my misses of the month
well not of the month just in the past
like a month I guess I really ever do
these sort of videos so if you guys like
to make sure give this video a thumbs up
and let's get straight into it
okay so I'm gonna be doing all of my
hits at the start and then I'm gonna be
doing all of my misses at the end now
let's rock on and get into it so the
first hit of the month is the Lancome
teint Idole ultra wear foundation now
you guys know I love this foundation I'm
only bringing it up again
because you all need to get it it is so
good this is in the shade this is in the
shade 215 buff n so buff and neutral so
it's got like a pinky undertone to it
which is perfect my skin tone and I love
mixing it with the giorgio armani
now this is the power fabric I used to
mix it with the luminous silk but this
has more coverage in it and when you mix
them together it's just like a magical
moment and it's something magical just
happens on your skin so if you haven't
tried these out I highly recommend them
my next hit of the month is the mecca
Mac's bronzer this is in the shade
sunlit skin honestly it is so like I
could even put more of it on now if I
wanted to and I'm probably going to but
like it's just so so nice it's like the
perfect color for my skin tone it might
be a little bit intense for some people
if you have my skin tone but just
because I do like that really intense
bronzy sort of like orange like low-key
orange look but honestly it's that good
now I only recently discovered this the
other day but this is the Physicians
Formula bronze Brewster bronzing palette
now it's got three shades in it I bought
this when I was in America I don't know
if it's available in Australia but if
you can ever get this you need to get it
this middle contouring shade here is
amazing it's got no glow to it at all so
it's fully fully matte and it's perfect
for contouring this is perfect for
bronzing and then this is perfect for
like highlighting underneath the eyes
and whatnot the next hit of the month is
this is the brilliant skin detoxifier
and brightening mask from sand and sky
so this is just a pink clay mask and I
love clay masks I've been testing it out
for quite a while and I do really really
like it so just a little bit about this
mask this is made with a hundred percent
natural Australian ingredients and pink
clay pretty much what this does is it
just gives your skin a nice like summery
glow within like ten minutes of taking
it off so it's all working on your skin
when you've got it on and then when you
take it off your skin looks like
immaculate this is completely cruelty
free and completely free of like other
STIs and stuff like that and most
importantly this helps skin regeneration
and basically just detoxifies everything
out of your skin gets all the toxins out
and it also helps clear and shrink your
pores so basically what I do with this
mask is I just pop it on my face after
cleansing it and everything
I just basically lay it on and then I
let it dry and then I just remove it
with a warm washcloth and my skin looks
da Ning yeah next is many a favorite
drugstore foundation this is the wet and
wild photo focus foundation this is in
the shade shale ivory I used this in a
few videos ago and I have for ever since
been in love with it I paid six dollars
and 19 cents us for this so around nine
Australian dollars and it's so good it
is hands down at my favorite drugstore
foundation it looks like skin it feels
like skin it's buildable it doesn't
oxidize it's just so freakin good
so my next hit of the month is the mecca
max illuminating primer this is in the
shade I don't know I think if there's
only one shade of it but it is so
beautiful it is literally a dupe for the
back of back like primer but it's bit
cheaper I fully support maker max
because I actually met the owner in the
creator of everything at one of the
Mecca Maxima events in Sydney a while
ago and she is the sweetest person ever
and honestly their products are so
fucking good my next hit of the month
this is the Marc Jacobs lip gloss in the
shade sugar sugar now if you guys see me
with a nude lip and if I have gloss on
it is 100% this this is in the shade
sugar sugar I just said that
best lip gloss ever it's like super high
shine and it's not sticky which is
awesome my next hit of the month is the
Maybelline loose translucent sorry loose
this is not translucent this is just a
loose powder in the shade fair Clair oh
five this is fucking incredible the
reason why I like this very much I've
actually got it on underneath my eyes
now it does not crease it does not go
patchy and the thing that I love about
it the most is I have this little patch
here where sometimes I sweat a little
bit from there and my makeup tends to
like all the powder underneath that like
comes through and shows off when I have
to brush it off but this does not do
that like I'm Lucia gonna be using this
in every single video if not I'm just
going to use it in this little spot and
then a different
around here if I have to change it up
but I'm obsessed with this I hope they
bring this out in Australia soon I don't
know if it's out yet but I bought this
one I was in America and when it comes
out in Australia guys if it does you
need to get it because honestly for the
price it's amazing and another hit of
the month this is the Sephora Pro
palette now I'm sorry to my Australians
you cannot buy this in the Australian
Sephora but guys I'm just putting it out
there this is the most beautiful palette
I have ever used
I would definitely write this my
favorite palette ever so huda beauty
just went out the window for the rose
gold texture palette I'll obviously
still use it and there are a lot of
eyeshadow palettes that I do love but
this is going to be my go to number one
whatever I'm like just doing my makeup
or if I'm not filming and I have to do
my makeup this is what I'm gonna reach
for because it's dead set the most
amazing palette I've ever used rock on
another hit of the month is not a makeup
product but it is for makeup products
this is the cinema secrets and makeup
brush cleaner I've been wanting to try
this since literally I started makeup
because everyone would talk about and
how amazing it is I bought this when I
was in Sephora in the US of A and
honestly it is just a professional like
it is just so good at clean its alcohol
so you don't need water or anything you
just quickly dip your brush in swirl it
around and it's done now I used to use
the hairdos I used to use the art taste
brush cleaner this is just as good you
can get this in Australia at Priceline
but I do prefer this over just because
it is a lot stronger and it gets every
single a little bit of product out now
for my misses of the month now this part
is a little bit controversial hon but
let's go on and get on with it
so the first miss of the month these are
the oil-free cleansing wipes from
Neutrogena now the only reason why I
don't like these because they've burned
the living fuck out of your skin and
these are pink grapefruit so they have a
very very strong scent and when you put
this on your eyes it stings like crazy
like the Loreal Pro glow concealer times
10 do not use these on your eyes
speaking of the Loreal Pro Glo concealer
this burnt the fuck out of my under eyes
and after uploading my video and saying
that it did a lot of other youtubers and
other people have had the experience of
having a burning sensation under their
eyes
L'Oreal if you're gonna put out a
product
that burns under eyes please re-evaluate
what is in your formula because it is
not a comfortable feeling at all I do
not recommend this at all rock on the
next miss of the month I'm so sorry to
say this but this is the tart smooth
operator powder Todd you know I love you
as a brand and some of my favorite
products come from you guys but honestly
this is just not for me if it works for
you that's awesome to me this just gave
me quite a bit of flashback and it kind
of removed the concealer when I put it
down and just gave my skin like a really
rough subtle book so I definitely won't
be using this again but I wish I could
love it because I love my setting
powders but I don't so ya might be using
this again rock on now the next mists of
the months this is the Natasha de Nonna
Leela palette
honestly guys I was filming her first
impressions with this the other day and
it was that bad that I literally had to
take it all off and I gave up on filming
because I was so angry because I had
such high expectations of this because
these palettes are so freakin expensive
this is what it looks like on the inside
of the palette the shutters it just
shits like it just reminds me of
subculture palette like you put the you
just put the eyeshadow onto your eye and
it just needs a big striking line it
doesn't blend out it's just so fucking
messy and horrible and shit I didn't
actually pay for this I got this in PR
so I'm probably gonna be off their
pilots now but I really don't mind if I
want a product I'll just go out and buy
it myself I don't like it I fucking hate
it move on see ya anyway this is the end
of today's video I really hope you guys
enjoyed my hits and my misses if you
