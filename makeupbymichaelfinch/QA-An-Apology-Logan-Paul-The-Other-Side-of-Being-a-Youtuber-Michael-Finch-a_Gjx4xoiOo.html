channel so today I'm gonna be doing a
Q&amp;amp;A I thought I haven't done one in so
long so I thought it's totally that time
that I did wanted to let you
guys in on a few things cuz you guys
have a lot of questions so I went over
to my Twitter and asked you guys to ask
me and juicy questions all questions
that I never really answer for this
video so yeah if you enjoy it make sure
you give it a thumbs up I love you guys
and let's go
okay so this isn't a question that I was
asked but it's my responsibility to kind
of address it in a video and I said on
my other social that I was going to so
basically for those who don't know what
happened
tot bought out a foundation and I only
bought out three deeper tones and like
ten different like colors that's pretty
much where everything kicked off and
people got really really angry with Todd
for doing that personally I don't know
if Todd did it on purpose as a PR stunt
as bad as that sounds that's what it
could have been because they've got it
everyone's talking about the Tarte
foundation and they are bringing out ten
or fifteen new shades I'm pretty sure so
it's kind of suss to me as to why they
didn't bring out all the shades in the
first place like did they want to cause
this controversy because they knew they
were going to bring other shades out
afterwards does that make sense I was in
the wrong and I totally should have used
my YouTube and my audience to explain
this issue honestly I just didn't know
whether it was my place or not to talk
about something like this that's why I
was a little bit hesitant to talk about
it I know for a fact that I have people
of color who watched my videos and I'm
really really really sorry if I offended
you by not mentioning this in my
foundation review I'm sorry if I've
upset you
as I said I just didn't know if it was
my place to talk about it or not the
reaction that I got from my foundation
review clearly tells me that I should
have spoken about it in the video and
people wouldn't have been angry with me
totally understandable if you're angry
with me or upset once again I'm really
really sorry if I did offend you I
should have spoken about it and it's
something like this does happen again I
can assure you that I will be talking
about it to the people that are saying
that I didn't want to speak about it
because I wanted to stay on that PR list
and get a free trip to Bora Bora
completely false I actually spoke
about one of Todd's products quite a
while ago and ever since then I haven't
got any PR off them and they've released
quite a lot of they've ignored my
emails so I'm pretty sure I'm off their
P Alice so that's not the reason why as
I said before I just didn't know if it
was my place to talk about it or not and
to be honest I'm really disappointed in
myself that I didn't talk about it as I
said I didn't know if it was my place to
say or not so I'm just gonna leave it at
that and I heard
those people who I've upset or offended
that you can forgive me and we can move
past this if not that's totally okay I
respect your decision it is what it is
okay so now I'm gonna be moving on to
your questions from my Twitter and I've
got quite a few here that I want to
answer if you guys dish the Goss on the
guy that fat grr okay so if I've had
lipstick on my teeth the whole entire
time I'm not gonna be a happy boy so
pretty much I was talking to this guy
for quite a while I'm sure you guys
could be sick of my boy stories by now
because they always end up turning out
bad anyway but anyway I was talking to
this guy said hey just I've known him
for so long we've seen each other a few
times and whatnot and he just started
ignoring a lot of my messages but then
he'd messaged me and like be like hey
like I'm sorry I've had things on this
has happened in life like just full of
 shitty excuses basically he asked
me for money and I was like okay first
of all no like you're a grown man he can
take care of your financial status
yourself you're not asking a 21
year-old for money by the way he's 26
but the 30s is not gonna have him behind
a 30 spine to me love a bit of the dad
and so basically he said that he wanted
to be serious then I was like yeah we
can give things agar and then he just
kept like ignoring my messages and
coming up with shitty excuses and
then I asked him I'm like sorry are you
out to like everyone like just everyone
know that you're gay and he pretty much
said only his family knows so how can
you give something a hundred percent
agar
if you're not out and like it has to be
kept like the biggest secret ever and
you guys know I'm sorry out there with
my life and I tell you guys everything
so that just wouldn't work so I was just
like see ya and there's a little
bit more to the story I did post a
screenshot on my Twitter of like how it
all went down but yeah that's pretty
much what's going on now and I'm not
talking to anyone and I'm not saying
anyone and honestly I think I was gonna
be single for life and I'm pretty cool
with that because of being used to it my
whole life for 21 years of living on
this earth but whatever so the next
question is what are your thoughts on
all of the Logan Paul controversy okay
so you guys want my honest thoughts
about this a Logan Paul is not a
dickhead he is not dumb he is a smart
businessmen he know he knew exactly what
he was doing by uploading
this video Logan is such a successful
guy he would have so many like you know
people on his team he's manages so many
managers he would have his legal team
and just so much like that she'd
control what he does post and he doesn't
post and if it affects his career or
what not so basically in my opinion as
sickening as it sounds this was a
complete publicity stunt
because before Logan was all over the
mainstream media he was just on you know
YouTube media and just spoken about like
that but ever since this has happened
and this has all come out like this he's
been in mainstream media he's gotten a
lot more attention he's growing at least
thirty to fifty percent more than he was
before so this is exactly what he wants
he just wants everybody to talk about it
for those who don't really know what
happened I'm not gonna talk about it on
my channel because it's just really
sickening in my eyes especially if it is
true that he did do it as a publicity
stunt which that's what I honestly think
while I honestly think like could you be
like it's just obvious you know what's
gonna happen if you put that up on
YouTube like you know the reaction like
you would think twice about it like any
normal person would think twice or more
about it and this is obviously his way
of just bullying is done and getting
into the media and it's exactly what
we're all giving him so that's my
opinion on it I reckon it's
distasteful the way he's done it to get
in the mainstream media or whatnot but
honestly like if you're part of the
lower gang don't come for me because I'm
honest a copy have you ever
fallen out with friends and why I love
you Michael love you too babe okay so a
lot of people always comment on my
videos lipstick all over my
teeth again a lot of people always
comment on my videos are you still
friends with Shaunie I haven't seen her
on social media so long you still
friends with sky I haven't seen on your
social media and so long I've answered
this quite a few times and I'm just
gonna say right now yes I'm still
friends with umpires I say Shaunie
literally almost every single day still
just because it's not put on social
media it doesn't mean like it didn't
happen like not everything has to go on
social media and that's what pisses me
off about a lot of people's opinions
like because I don't see it on snapchat
it didn't it pretty much just didn't
happen like back in the day when were in
school and like two years sevens got
into a relationship and if it wasn't on
Facebook it wasn't official until it was
safe
fish after show do you know what I mean
like my brands going a million
hundred miles an hour right now because
I'm thinking about so much and I
literally can't think straight so if my
answers don't really make sense it's
because I've got a lot on my mind
I literally sidenote sorry when this
video is uploaded I'll be in Melbourne
and then the next day I have to go to
Sydney and then I have to come back to
Brisbane on Saturday and then Sunday I
have harm and then Monday I have to go
to the Maldives and then I'm there for
five days then I have to go straight to
Perth for the perform aster class so the
next few weeks are completely hectic for
me so I put a lot on so as I said if my
hands don't make sense you know exactly
why but I'm still getting my point
across you know what I'm saying what
happened between you and Erin okay so
for those who don't know arm was one of
my old best friends who I used to hang
out with all the time we made videos
together because all over my social
media noble never in a relationship for
those who are asking you straight you
know how friends just stop talking and
like a little bit of drama might go down
and just like a little bit of bad
might go down that's pretty much what
happened we don't hate each other I
don't hate him I don't think he hates me
because he messaged me on my 21st
birthday and said happy birthday
um but yeah people just like just apart
and stop talking and that's exactly what
happened when was the last time you got
hit on by a cute guy never I really like
this next one what would you be doing
right now if you weren't a youtuber
okay so I've always answered this and
I've never really known what to say but
I was getting my nails done the other
day by my now lady and I was like you
know what if I wasn't doing YouTube I'd
probably be a nail artist or I'd be
doing like makeup on clients but I'd
want to switch it up I shall probably
might be doing hair and makeup and nails
that'd be fun I mean like these now Stu
manages everything and I feel like I
would love doing nails as a job because
I'm sorry passionate about them just as
much as I am makeup and not really had
to be honest about makeup and nails or
like my everything what is your biggest
fear
my biggest fear would have to be losing
my mom or losing my mom and dad or just
like family in general like my mom to me
is absolutely everything and I don't
really want to talk about it cuz I don't
like talking about it but yeah my
biggest fear is losing my mom
losing people like it's just no it's not
happening
I really like this next one as well do
you ever get bored of makeup /
uninspired but feel obligated to keep up
because of your YouTube okay so the
thing with YouTube is I like to get
three videos out a week to you guys and
there's constantly new trends and
there's new makeup products coming out
like it's a new year it's the Wow okay
this is a problem it's a new year it's
2018 a lot of makeup brands are bringing
out all this new for the new year
which I'm so excited about so there's
constantly new trends new makeup
products new challenge videos new ideas
there's constantly new ideas being
thrown around at the end of last year I
felt super uninspired so I was kind of
just like mellow on YouTube and I kind
of missed a few upload days but if I'm
uploading three times a week you know
I'm having a really good week and I'm
not stressed out and I've got a lot of
ideas and I'm really motivated and I'm
really feeling it I don't really ever
force myself to film a video if I darn
want or if I'm not in the mood sometimes
if I do a voiceover like a makeup
tutorial and if I do a voiceover it's
because I'm actually not in the mood to
talk but I still want to get a video up
for you guys sometimes I have my off
days and I have my good days but
majority of the time when you see me I'm
having good days which is good because I
like to keep which already have stopped
on my channel super positive the next
question is why haven't you done a video
with just to start on your channel my
sister is completely camera shy she
rarely ever ever lets me take a photo
with her or of her she's one of those
people that would just go like this if
she sees a camera or like an iPhone
ready to take a camera in her face
that's why she's never been on camera
but maybe one day I'll get her up to
Brisbane and we can film a video
together because there's a lot of
similarities with us and she looks like
almost identical to my mom when she was
younger it's kind of scary but yeah and
the last question that I'm gonna answer
today is how do you take care of your
mental health dealing with being in the
public eye / internet public sometimes I
feel like there's a constant pressure to
be perfect or look Instagram ready all
the time but that's not how it is at all
now when I answer this question in no
way shape or form am I saying
that I don't like what I do or I'm if I
sound ungrateful that's not what I mean
sorry for those who want to twist it and
do that I mean go for your life but
that's not my intention at all so I feel
like people just have really high
expectations of you to always look
really really good like there was one
instance actually there's been a few
that are similar to the one I'm about to
tell you guys so pretty much this mum
came up to me and her daughter must have
been one of my followers and she came at
me she said my daughter really wanted a
photo with you but you have no makeup on
so she's really upset and she doesn't
want a photo anymore thanks for letting
me know like that's what I mean like
that's what I'm talking about like
there's always that expectation that you
have to be like pristine on point all
the time so you know I have my good days
and I have my bad days there's always
those hate comments there's always the
people who take so much time to write
their hate comments they don't affect me
I'm saying that but at the end of the
day all of them put together it affects
you the slightest little bit like some
people it affects so much like some
influences on the internet it affects
them so much and they always write about
it and stuff like that but I just choose
to ignore it but at the end of the day
it does affect you a tiny bit it's that
like it affects me a tiny bit so I don't
want this to sound bad but if you're
wanting to start a YouTube channel make
sure that you are mentally prepared to
deal with all this that comes along
with it because there is a lot like
especially when people say YouTube is
easy I mean it's it's very very easy
compared to you know your casual like
getting up every day going to work and
whatnot all you know starting at uni or
something like that
some people don't even think it's a real
job but in my eyes it's a real job to me
and I didn't expect it to be a real job
it just kind of happened and I was like
hey let's just go with that but it's not
easy there's a lot of that goes
down behind the scenes are for example
if you don't upload in time sometimes
people get really really angry with you
there's always brands that are trying to
rip you off with sponsorships and
whatnot like management companies like
always trying to with your
like just PR companies trying to
with your people trying to take
advantage of
you not knowing if someone wants to be
your friend for followers or not knowing
someone's interested in you because they
want money or like things like there's
so much other that goes with it
it's not just as simple as sitting in
front of a camera and talking well it is
but there is a lot of that goes on
behind the scenes you get what I'm
saying okay guys that is everything from
me today I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and if you did give it a thumbs up
if you three if you want to and if you
have any other questions that I didn't
answer
you can ask me a few in the comments
below because I'll probably have you
answer them true I go through comments
and apply to them all the time
especially if you get in the comments
within the first half an hour I
literally reply to all the comments I
love you guys so much and I will see you
all in my next video bye see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
