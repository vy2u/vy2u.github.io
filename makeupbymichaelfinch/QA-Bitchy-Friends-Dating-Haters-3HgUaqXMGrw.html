channel so today I'm gonna be doing a
Q&amp;amp;A I haven't done one for about a month
so I think it is time for another one so
let's get straight into the questions I
asked you guys on Twitter if you had any
questions for me so I'm going off these
Twitter questions for today let's get
into it
okay well mommy I want
who is your celebrity crush Justin
Bieber I know I'm a little fan I'm a
little believe I'm a little fan go
honestly thar he's sorry fucking hard
speaks for himself see ya
now a lot of people have been asking the
story behind my scar on my arm a lot of
people always comment about it on my
videos so pretty much what happened here
is this is the scar on my arm it is this
big when I was younger I had a birthmark
there and it was the color of just it
was just a brown birthmark and the
reason why I got rid of it well I was
really young and I couldn't make
decisions so my parents decided to get
rid of it because apparently the doctor
said that it could have been really
cancerous when I was older just because
of my skin tone and how pale I am and
naturally I am a little bit strawberry
blonde under here so um yeah so they
decided to get rid of it and I don't
really mind like I'm kind of glad that
it's gone I didn't really like it anyway
I actually have to have three operations
on it and I don't know if you guys can
tell but let's see how my arm goes down
I know it's kind of weird I'm sorry but
like it's just me sorry deal with it
they tried to pull I had three
operations have been pulling the skin
together to try and pull it together but
then the last operation that no I meant
to do they ran out of skin apparently so
they had to do a skin graft so I gotta
take him off the front of my leg like on
my thigh
so my leg is on my arm so when I touch
my arm I can feel it on my leg not
really I just tell everyone I got bitten
by a shocking honestly 99% of people
believe it are you actually going to get
a dog
and when yes I'm gonna get a job when I
get back from America in a few weeks and
I'm so excited I don't know what type I
don't know what it's gonna look like I
just want it to be really small and like
super cute and I'm definitely gonna call
up Gucci well I like this next question
if the roles were reversed and you had
to ask after question what would you ask
I would ask you guys why you are
subscribed to me so maybe answer this in
the comments below why you subscribe to
me why do you choose to watch my videos
I'm really interested to know what you
guys say to that so yeah leave it in the
comments below as to why you decided to
hit that subscribe button have you done
it up the bomb
how do you deal with people who - I
raisin um I don't really deal with it
cuz they're pretty much dead to me
there's pretty much someone just through
a computer screen or if someone decides
to hate me in real life then go for your
actual life cuz I don't give a fuck the
way that I deal with it is I just ignore
it and move on with my day that's the
best way to go about it move on and
they'll shut the fuck up what is your
favorite place to get food um my
favorite place to get food is probably
community Cantina if you don't know what
that is it's like salad bowls sort of
thing with like you can add like chicken
or like beef or like pork
it's got like avocado and shit it's
really healthy I mean it's pretty
healthy it's good what are your thoughts
on the beautiful Shawn Mendes um he's
literally so hot I would not mind
spending a night in bed with him - does
size really matter who love ya um I mean
it just depends how you use it down
that's what it comes down to what is one
thing that you would change about your
past probably nothing I tend to live
life with no regrets because I believe
that everything happens for a reason in
saying that I'm not talking about
negative things because a lot of them
don't happen for any specific reason
they just happen because shit happens do
you know what I mean but I tend to like
not look back on bad times and just
think that it did happen for a reason if
that makes sense give us a rundown on
your American trip okay sir I have no
idea what's going on I'm sorry about at
planning things so Ronnie and Lilly have
just been planning everything booking
everything and that's pretty much it
that's all I know I know we're going to
LA New York and then like little things
like going to the Eiffel Tower
no not the Eiffel Tower fuck I forget
what it's all you know not new rekha
nuts in Melbourne Empire State Building
the way that I remembered that was
Alicia Keys a son
why does Lily have hands like chicken
feet autonomic Oscar what was your dream
job growing up um it was to be a
celebrity makeup artist and do makeup
for the Kardashians but now I don't
really have an interest in doing that I
just like to keep to myself I don't take
clients anymore if people are asking I
still get a lot of all my manager gets a
lot of emails to her email asking if I
drew makeup just any guys know that I
don't take bookings YouTube is my job
and I don't take clients in
if I didn't do YouTube I would still be
taking clients what would you describe
your supporters in one word fucking
amazing I turn it into one word by just
adding no gap in between fucking amazing
fucking Amazon fuck kind of Awesome what
do you Mon oh my god I'm now oh my god
everyone always calls me out to my now
it's just putting it out there how many
males are in your lips the limit just
not exist
who is your funniest friend probably
Lily every single time she is around I'm
always hyperventilating and I can't
breathe because she's always don't
something with a hot dog she's like well
I wonder if on someone said how did you
start working at Mac I actually never
worked at Mac I never worked at a makeup
counter our YouTube is the celebrities
of Australia G get recognized every time
you go out in Australia are you
considered a B C or D list celeb okay
sir I don't consider myself a celebrity
at all I'm just like everybody else
except I make videos and post them on
the internet so I'm not considered a
celebrity at all um do you get
recognized a lot probably 90% of the
time people come up they get a photo
they say hello how you going how's your
day what are you doing I'm like what are
you buying what's in your Louie Vuitton
bag what did you do last night what did
you have a breakfast do you know what am
i what is your worst experience with a
guy um okay so my worst experience with
a guy is where you start talking to them
and like everything's all good and
you're like oh my god he's cute like if
you start talking and then suddenly like
go I want to grow myself on Instagram
and I'm like fucking see ya do you have
any friends in your group who you have
problems with sometimes I mean of course
everyone has like little moments every
now and again and if you didn't argue or
like have little miscommunications with
your friends then everything I feel like
everything will be bottled up because
that's just how it is like in every
friendship group there's always a little
bit of drama but very very very rarely
do you find sharing all of your personal
life on YouTube hard sometimes love you
love you more not really to be honest I
mean I choose to do this I choose to
tell everyone and show everyone my life
there are obviously things that aren't
always put on the Internet and some
things that shouldn't be put on the
Internet which is how I live my life do
you know what I mean so yeah a lot of my
life is put on the internet but some
things are kept private for the right
reasons what is your next high-end
/ designer purchase okay so I just want
to quickly touch on something right here
right now Jill I'd really love buying
materialistic things that's because I
work fucking hard for them and I deserve
them and if I'm gonna spend my money on
something it's gonna be that I mean I
really should be saving up for a car but
at the same time I'm like oh my god like
don't even want this released in your
collection but my next purchase I want
it to be a Cartier bracelet but honestly
like they're just so much money but
honestly one day I'm gonna get it that
is my goal like I have goals in life
they're not all to buy like a fucking
new Louis Vuitton bag or the fucking car
do I star a slit like I have other goals
too like my weight loss for example um
I'm not gonna stop until I have abs in a
v-line it might take two years I might
take one two three four or five years I
don't know but I'm not gonna stop until
I get it that is my goal and when you
reach goals you feel so fucking
conquered so you have a goal go for it
because I know you'll get there if you
can set your mind to it you can do
anything you want how do you deal with
hater comments and has a hater ever made
you want to give up YouTube because it
got too much okay sir I'm so used to
getting hate comments I mean I'm a guy
in makeup a lot of people still don't
think it's normal I'm not the only one
who gets hate on YouTube a lot of people
on YouTube get hate even the smallest
youtubers someone will just have to be a
little cunt in the comments and leave a
hate comment I am so used to it by now I
know that's really sad and a lot of
people will think that's really sad I
don't want I'm not asking for sympathy
because it's just kind of like when I
first started YouTube I'd get a few hate
comments but over time as I've grown it
obviously gets worse because your videos
are seen by more people and stuff like
that especially when they hit the
trending page all my videos tend to hit
the training page at some point and I
know when they hit the trending page
because I just see a bunch of like hate
comments like kill yourself you faggot
like all in the comments I'm like what
are you man
why can't you watch the taunt on
something else wrong with my wife and my
hot car man how about as your life
boring probably us did she ever get
suspended in school yes I got suspended
in school so many times because I was
either laughing at the amount of times
that I got in trouble for laughing was a
joke like it was a joke or I got in
trouble for swearing because I would
always swear in front of the teachers
without even realizing it just slip out
next thing I know
stuck in the office the whole fucking
day and I'm over it
and the last question I'm gonna answer
today is do you have a boyfriend or do
you plan on dating no I'm single a F and
do I plan on dating who knows anyway
guys that's all I have time for today I
hope you really enjoyed this video and I
hope you learnt a few new things about
me that you wanted to know if you did
make sure you give this video a massive
thumbs up I love you guys so much and I
will see you all in my next video bye
fucking see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
