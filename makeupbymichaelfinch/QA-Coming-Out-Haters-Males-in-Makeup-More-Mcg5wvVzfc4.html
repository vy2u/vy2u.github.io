today I'm gonna be filming a snapchat
Q&amp;amp;A if you guys don't know what this is
basically it's where asked you guys to
send me snapchats
like snapchat videos for this video and
I'll answer them live on camera so you
don't have me on snapchat add me now so
it's gonna be my next one here it is let
go
now these snapchats are literally flying
through so let's get started make sure
it's allowed okay mmm
would I ever be able would I not be able
to ever say I mean or stay out ever
again
probably I mean because that kind of
gets annoying I mean sort of stay a bit
like soon as lots little luck jeez it's
like an everyday feel like so
 so like I don't think bye oh I
drop it but like say I look so
thank you for watching all my videos how
do I deal with hate hmm I don't know I
guess I just kind of see it and I'm just
like soil I could just go
straight over the top of my head on my
back like their sword this so much she
said about me on the Internet is big is
about like almost every influence so
like every influencer has haters out
there and um I actually found this
useful read the other day that was fully
about me and I was like oh my god thanks
sorry buddy there were so many Highfill
people in the world but honestly like I
just read and I'm just like like they
literally don't have a laugh cuz they're
literally because like they've literally
literally written paragraphs of hatred
about me and just like stop that's not
even true sorry do I count I know what's
true and what's not sorry
love you have I ever experienced
with doors just like 100 percent believe
in ghosts you can actually have a story
time on my video about what happened I'm
not sure but yeah I have and I'd be
pretty naive not to believe in ghosts
because wow there are a few
superstitious people in my family there
are a few people that I know if you
believe in that sort of stuff and she
could have told me and they would
make it up sir yeah so I'll be out of
there everyone catches on to nothing
sorry funny what was it like when I
first started making YouTube videos I
heard like what do you mean by like what
was it like it was kind of scary in a
way she like put myself out there and I
never knew I'd be like where I am now in
my opinion I'm pretty happy with where I
am at the moment and I didn't expect
myself to cry as much as I've grown in
the past few months like the past year
or something but um yeah like the more
you put yourself out there the scarier
it is the scary I is because the more
people know like about your life but at
the same time it's like my choice that I
put everything out of this or I'm not
one to stay here and complain about not
do I like being the older to better :
for me why do you guys do that I think
I'm gonna have to say I like Lunas gonna
kill me if she ever watches this I mean
he's gonna watch it cuz she's like my
number one Supporter but I'm gonna have
to say baby I do love you more because
you need to cool indie you've been a
naughty girl
if you got bullied in high school and
like how you dealt with it okay I just
want to tell you one time I nearly met
you but I didn't have the balls like I
was actually so I was like okay look
like a she was sorry cute I try to
forget the question that you asked I
just heard that you said that you liked
watching my videos and then you always
met me one time but you look like a
right ton I probably did too if you ever
stick me again just come out to me I
don't care what you look like a lot of
people say when they meet me for
the first time they're like oh my god I
have no makeup on I'm so sorry I'm like
I don't care bag like it doesn't matter
like makeup comes off makeup where it's
all like it doesn't bother me like just
come and see me I don't care by the way
I love you too out of all of my youtuber
friends who do you think is the best
makeup artist to be honest I don't have
that many YouTube friends that are close
but if I would have to choose it would
obviously be Shani I mean if I didn't
say that should probably kill me it's
like well gets probably her no it is her
they asked what I rather prefer my body
with Indies head or Billy's head with my
body I had Bendis head wasn't about
bending how old was I when I found out
that I was gay well long story short
basically I used to get cold
 pull everything in high school
I'm like what does this mean like I
would do bye to everyone
and then I always think I was sitting in
class one day and it just clicked and
it's just like oh my god like these
people being right for all these years
no they should be calling me a
antipope than that but I just like
clicked me and I was like oh my god like
these people arrived like I actually
haven't been denying it this whole time
but why is it such a bad thing like I
think I was in like yeah I saw nine I
didn't actually know it might have been
younger might have been older but yeah
that's basically how it happened how do
I become so confident I've just learnt
to say the haters say sue
and say them back that's literally
all I do when I first started you know
making videos and stuff and when I got
one bit I hate I was sore devil about it
but then I just got more used to what
was just like sad but that's just like
reality if you put yourself on the
Internet that's what's gonna happen
and ya know I'm just like I love
you too what are my thoughts on the many
anyway make up a palette well I didn't
have it right here here it is right now
I've I've used this in several tutorials
I think it's like probably has to be one
of my Holy Grails consumer so Tommy can
do so many look so that you've got your
transition your brown your darkness you
redness your grain your brow bar and
highlight ago I'm so glad you ordered
make sure to have so much fun with this
palette bubby my holy grail fake tan
would have to be fun by Stan's dark
teni worse I don't know why it's just so
good and I'm get to still try the ultra
dark which hardly I can get soon what
was the hardest part about getting into
makeup I wasn't really scared I was more
so worried about what other people would
think when I wore it out in public and
what my dad would think like what my
family would think and like I would try
and hide it like when I first started
out where
minimal foundation very minimal filtered
eyebrows and like each like week I would
probably add a bit of a scar a bit of a
shadow so I wasn't just like a full-on
hit of makeup so that is like a good way
back for example if you're someone who's
just starting out to wear makeup like
especially if you're like a young guy or
something and you want to like make it
discreet so it's not just like full face
like blush contour foundation everything
one here what I did was this is gonna
sound stupid but it worked like it was
like easier to like tell them I guess
like one week or a couple of weeks on a
foundation that has like a bit more like
just adding more as you go so it's not
just one big massive like hit a full
face makeup in everybody's face so just
gradually add it like I feel like that
works that shouldn't even have to be a
thing like we shouldn't have to worry
about that but that's what is today the
caption was I'm hung as meaning
she's hungry as I probably liked
them better from segment cuz reject shot
one's kind of like to scare me like the
packaging is like real culture you
shouldn't out there I don't know I'm
just gonna answer one more question I'm
sorry guys I wish I could literally
answer all the latest so I've ever many
might like the video be very like ha so
I'm just gonna choose a random one and
it's gonna be from a girl called
Courtney gray
oh thanks Claudia I love how I come back
I'm just gonna answer one more question
it's from Corinne she's like this isn't
even a question but I love you but
that's funny in that case I'll just do
one more
oh girl well I feel like the
L'Oreal infallible does not give any
flashback at all I don't even know if
there's SPF in here I don't think there
is but on and find flashback with this
and for powder that Australis fresh and
flawless pressed powder does not give
flashback at all guarantee and my guys
that is the end of todays video i hope
you all enjoyed i'm sorry I'm still a
little bit mathy up so what kind of bit
of a cold but if you did don't forget to
give me a thumbs up I love you guys so
much and I'll see you all in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
