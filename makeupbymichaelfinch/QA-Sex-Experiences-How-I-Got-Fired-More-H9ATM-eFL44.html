today I'm gonna be doing a another Q&amp;amp;A
the last time I did one was like the
star in July I think and went out in
August so it's time for an update I went
to Instagram to ask you guys if you have
any questions that you wanted to ask me
and we have like 300 so I'm a power
through as many as I can and gets right
into it now I did say I'm the dirtier
the better so I did ask for it doesn't
mean you gonna get the correct answers
okay because my mom is probably watching
this video so mum if you're watching can
you out of respect stop watching right
now yet better yet any of my family stop
watching utter respect thank you so much
when was your first ever time sex
experience well I don't actually know
how old I was but I think I was 14 or 15
oh my god this is fucked up next
question what is your Holy Grail makeup
product well surprisingly enough it's
actually a setting spray or like a
hydrating mist because honestly I love
them so much
benefits Plus here in their hands and a
taste really good tuna also smells
really good
so I definitely can't live without my
fix+ what was the craziest night of your
life so far and why now I don't know if
you want to know this in a negative way
or in a good way craziest night of my
life was when some fucking stupid bitch
I'm actually made a video on this a long
time ago some stupid bitch was have you
got me for being for being in the girls
toilets um basically I decided to
evacuate the situation so I left and as
well either she was started to drink
over the back of me and my friends so I
then drenched her in my drink and then
her boyfriend attacked me and knocks me
out so that was really one of the
craziest nights of my life
but if you want to know a good one I
don't know just like getting drunk with
all my friends was so much fun
what was your first memory of makeup by
the way love you love you too my first
memory of makeup was when I was a lot
younger and I was actually debating
about going there today because I do
want to do the kids full face of makeup
challenge and they still stock the
makeup that I bought the for the first
night ever bought makeup it was from a
$2.00 shop and it was like four dollar
foundation to Toliver scars
lipstick yeah i think i remembers
telling one of my mom's black eyeliner
pencils and i put it in my waterline and
like had like though i was going through
the whole emo like phase so i my friend
jay was was like taking photos for
myspace like yeah i feel better why are
there any piercings or tattoos you want
one day I've already got a tattoo on my
wrist it was a friendship tattoo um I'm
really good friends with that person and
I haven't been for like two years now
but I feel like I'm not going to change
it to start I was like fuck I want this
gone but now I feel like I don't want to
change it because like I've the memories
that we did have do not I mean but at
the same time I'm like I don't know
don't get rid of that actually infinity
side on my wrist coming off showing you
and a piercing I've always wanted my I
don't know what it's called but it's
like in my Cupid's bow but every single
time I tell one of my friends that I
want it done they like do a fuckin
serious I'm like yes I'm serious I feel
like it would look cool but it would
have so bad so I think I'm just going to
kind of avoid that for a long time
who is your ultimate celeb crush know my
last when I'm pretty sure I said Bradley
Cooper and Zac Efron but it's changed to
Justin Bieber what's your all-time
favorite liquid lipstick color well my
favorite liquid lipstick color is
obviously all men nude colors
my first favorite that I ever found was
started from dose of colors until I
decided to change the formula of that
and then it was celebrity skin until
Jeffery decided to change the formula or
that I'm so currently at the moment it's
called Chi by color pop I don't wear it
often but I do wear it like not in my
youtube videos um yeah cheap buy color
pop love it what's your idea of good
foreplay someone said boobs or bad well
I mean obviously not boobs I mean
they're squishy and shit he can like
squish on them like stuck on the nipples
and stuff but other than that like
obviously it's gonna be the booty this
is so funny have you ever had a bad
first day - love you love you - Cassidy
I've never been on a date before do I
look like I've been on a day no what is
your favourite swearword my favorite
swear word is cunt just putting it out
there some people think it's so dirty in
which it kind of is but like honestly
it's just like another word for a vagina
like get over yourself Real Talk well
you get a fierce motherfucking photo
with me and I'm f
Sydnee love you I love you too Belle yes
I will come up and say hello and let's
take some fucking and fierce as fuck
selfies I'll be there on Saturday maybe
on Sunday too but I definitely know that
I'll be there the first day this time
because last year I was only live it's
like a diagonal shit so I'll be there
the first day this time worst bitches
person you have ever come across by the
way love you so much
lovely to Cheyenne so the most bitchiest
person that I've ever come across was
actually someone's makeup that I had to
do and I'm not gonna say names because I
don't want to burn no bridges but um
they're all like a well-known celebrity
um Australian obviously and so fucking
rude like just because you know most of
Australia knows who you are
doesn't mean you can treat other people
like shit and given everything to you on
a platter okay so yeah do you ever get
hate for being gay and wearing makeup
how do you deal with it love you I love
you to analyse yes I do always get hey
and that's something that I will always
have to deal with I guess I'm just kind
of used to it now which is sad but
that's just how it goes
is your ear stretched or just a regular
piercing this is just a regular piercing
huns have you ever been peer pressured
to do something you didn't want to do
and still regret it to this day I don't
believe in peer pressure like if
someone's trying to peer pressure you
into doing something don't do it I think
it's fucking horrible and if you don't
want to do something if you don't think
it's right and don't do it if you were
given a chance to collab with any brand
what brand would it be and if you could
work with any makeup artist past or
present who would it be I would love to
work with joy Spinelli or Rob Chevy and
if I was to collab with any sort of
brand it would either be makeup geek it
would either be makeup geek Too Faced or
Anastasio Beverly Hills on my fucking
god imagine done when you show Jeffrey
star video coming out about the fake
lipsticks um when I get them all in the
post that's when I will be making the
video would you rather be eaten out by a
dinosaur or a crocodile probably a
crocodile what's the longest dick that
either ever had um I don't know I don't
like Ted to measure like other people's
dicks so yeah but I'll
say the bigger the better would you ever
shave your head fuck no I would look
like a Buddha people would come up to me
grab my tits and be like you're a
fucking Buddha cunt or they would like
rub my belly and like hope for a wish or
something lady literally if I shave my
head I would look like the biggest
whatever I can't even tell what's your
favorite pair of shoes you are well I've
never really been a big shoe bearer but
I just bought out of our superstars the
other day and I'm literally obsessed and
then I just went on eBay and bought a
fuckload of other shoe so loved it I
need to say who's asking me this Chris
Fox when it comes to gogogogogo gagging
on the dick do you spit or swallow
pierce lovely Miss Piggy you're a piece
of shit let's just say that I don't do
what you do Chris hope there's someone
in the comments here who's a little bit
confused if I'm a boy or a girl not a
problem not even gonna respond how many
dicks have you sucks um I don't know
I don't lean count you know I'm totally
kidding by the way I'm will talk say up
is sucking a dick easy I mean no it's
fucking hard work
Real Talk not gonna lie God look at my
setting this on YouTube so many people
are watching these ah if you could have
a threesome with any celebrities all
youtubers who would it be with PF I
fucking love yous sorry oh love you too
Meg um so it would be Bradley Cooper
Zach are on and Justin Bieber like
literally just imagine that oh and if I
had to choose somebody like another
group of three it would be Nelly a shot
and Chris Brown have you ever had sex
with a girl fuck no yeah tell us about
the job you got fired from for posting a
video about customers so I got in
trouble for posting a video I made a
video that was like customers to piss me
off right and I went to work one day my
bosses were like can we talk girls like
our fucking dick and balls so I went
over to talk to him and they were like
yeah apparently I can't we had a
complaint from a customer who had seen
that and I thought I mean not gonna lie
but there was someone that I was working
with at the time he was like 40 more
years older than me
Mangia I made crap I say one single
thing to her because she was a complete
fucking cunt bye
I mean if there's a 40 year old woman
having a sulk about an age like I was 18
or 17 at the time that I said something
to her like grow up like you're fucking
having a suck about something that you
know asses like I said something that
was so minor anyway so I know she dumped
me and for it and it wasn't an actual
customer because I wouldn't tell me who
the customer was because I came ahead
and I'm like okay well I want to
apologize to the customer so who was it
and I just kind of went and I'm like
yeah it was fucking this bitch wasn't it
they never admitted it but yeah that's
the story with that and the last
question I'm going to answer because
there's literally so many is how old are
you and I am 19 years old and a lot of
people are still shocked by that which
is kind of odd but I mean what about
anyway guys that is the end of today's
video I hope you enjoyed this sexual QA
and if you did don't forget to give me a
thumbs up and I will see you all in my
next video
