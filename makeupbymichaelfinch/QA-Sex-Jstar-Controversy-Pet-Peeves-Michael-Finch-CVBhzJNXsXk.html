Journal what the fuck that was Oh
so today I'm gonna be doing aq and a and
I have not done one of these in quite a
while the last one I did was like a
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A and I don't know people
liked them I think I'd rather just like
regular Q&amp;amp;A so I'm doing that so I asked
you guys on my Instagram um if you have
any questions for me and we have a lot
of questions so I'm a power 3ds and
answer as many as I possibly can
what is your biggest fear vagina what
are some basic products that everybody
needs um I think everyone needs a pair
of false lashes I think everyone needs
foundation primer definitely a body
concealer than your foundation so you
can highlight I feel like they're like
holy grails
in my makeup collection I can't live
without them alright and a Beauty
Blender and a good eye shadow palette
there's a lot of stuff what sort of
music are you into so I'm into so much
music like I love the top 40 countdown
or whatever Triple J's stars em which is
like I was like an Australian radio
station they play all the new shit and
then I also like SoundCloud like
Melbourne bangers and like all the
Melbourne DJs they're so entertaining
any advice for being happy and fabulous
well any advice for being happy and
fabulous just be yourself and in saying
just be yourself always make sure you're
safe in the wrong situations if that
makes sense
always be yourself and yeah I just do
what you want because that's what I do
if you weren't doing YouTube now what do
you think you would be doing instead I
would probably just be freelancing um
doing makeup and working probably in
hospitality somewhere do you want kids
honest to god I feel like I would be the
best dad ever I feel like I can be a
very responsible parent I'm only 19
years old so I don't know if saying that
is politically correct but I feel like I
can be very responsible and yes I would
love to have kids one day that would be
very much fun and be so cute if you
could only listen to one song for the
rest of your life what would it be it
would definitely be sorry but Beyonce
I'm fucking obsessed and I that is one
song that I will never get sick of I
I'm a little confused on this one
someone said do you see yourself
transitioning fully okay so I'm assuming
transitioning into a girl um I'm
actually not transgender I am just a guy
I think it's called I'm not really good
with labels because I don't really like
labeling people or myself but I'm pretty
sure it's called
androgynous but I'm not a hundred
percent so don't quote me on it but yeah
some people think I'm transgender and
I'm actually not transgender I have no
plans of transitioning at all and so
yeah I'm not transitioning at all hon do
you plan on getting any other cosmetic
procedures done in the near future
most definitely I have always wanted
when I was younger I've always wanted
like bigger lips not younger but like I
just me like lip fillers were just like
wow like they're amazing like I really
want them and I finally got them and
then Botox as well like it just feels in
like I'm just like obsessed with like
smooth skin like smoothness like there's
no forehead wrinkles anymore like my
lips are just like filled in like
club-like I love them but if I want to
get anything else done it would
definitely be my nose because I honestly
hate it like started profile of my nose
is okay but when I turn to the side it's
like this big ball and it's just it
drives me insane so definitely I really
want my nose done I want my ears pulled
back a little bit because I feel like
they stick out too much I don't know I
definitely want oh my gorge I don't want
something done to my jaw so I'm so like
it doesn't look as fat so I don't have
to contour it as much and then I want my
my eyes pulled up a little bit and then
I want them like almond shaped a little
bit I want cheek filler I literally just
want everything done under the Sun that
you can get done as a cosmetic procedure
Real Talk okay here is your queen ladies
and gentlemen my queen is mr. Patrick
Starr honey
obsessed Idol kind of say to me guys
went in on the questions like I wrote in
the description I was like you guys can
own me anything you want about my life
like about dick and balls or anything
and people are really going in on the
sexual questions I'm telling you about
what is your biggest pet peeve my
biggest pet peeve is when people do not
reply to text message just straight away
and they're online and they ignore you
then they come
shitty excuse and I'm also gonna say in
saying that I sometimes do that as well
and I complain about it just as much as
I do it but it still pisses me off stuff
technically one of my pet peeves Oh
who are your favorite youtubers so my
favorite youtubers change all the time
because I'm constantly finding new ones
but once I'm obsessed with is Tana mojo
like her story time videos just fuck me
up severely and Jesse smiles is also so
funny if you haven't watched Jesse
smiles video on Sam pepper tried to
fight me I'll leave a link down below
for it oh my god it is literally the
funniest video I've ever seen
but why are you there though but were
you there though were you there watch
the video and then that'll make sense to
you okay so I get this question a lot
and people ask me what happened to your
arm
so my arm I don't know you talk about
what's wrong with the huns um so I had a
birthmark just here and I got it removed
so I got a skin graft so I got some skin
taking off my leg and put onto my arm
everyone always asked me if it's a bird
I'd only just tell people it's a shark
bite or if people ask me really rude
like really really like ill what the
fuck happened to your arm like I get
those comments on Instagram sometimes
I'm just like hon I got bit by a fucking
pink flamingo what is your favorite fake
tan my favorite fake ten I've gone
through a lot of Chan's I'm a shit at
telling myself I'm just learning how to
do it properly side a little dirty and
muddy and I've been obsessed with Bondi
sands I've actually got it on now like
it doesn't look bad like I feel like
I've conquered how to use fake tan
because honestly I've gone through so
many bad experiences with fake tan ins
just so dramatic but um yeah I feel like
Bono Sands is the one like I used it in
when I was up in Brisbane Sean and let
me use it because I've never used it
before and I was like Holly fuck like
this Studies on it's not like patchy it
doesn't come off I just wear off like
it's actually good I'm actually slept in
at last I'm looking over my bed now
hun of my fucking white sheets are
fucking pink and brown and red there's
fake tan everywhere but I'm just gonna
eaten all that and just move on Oh what
is your most embarrassing moment well
I've actually done a video on this and
they're not very updated but I'm a
really embarrassing moment that I don't
remember so I was out clubbing with a
few friends and I was so drunk to the
point where
I was like unresponsive but like I
wasn't like falling over and like being
an idiot I just like wasn't talking when
I get really drunk I don't talk because
I just can't be bothered by I'm just
fucking lazy as shit so apparently like
me and my friend went up to like a group
of her friends and like at the club and
they were like oh my god I love your
makeup and apparently I just go and look
away and I do nothing I don't even say
thank you I don't say hello and I was
like oh my god she taught me that a few
days later don't stress
I box the girl that I apparently did it
too and I apologize she does remember
cuz she was too drunk as well but I'm
that's so fucking embarrassing that I
would do that like I'm normally never
ever ever ever ever like that like I'm
only like thank you so much like I'm all
about meeting new people and stuff but
um yeah that definitely was not a look
at myself that night darlin is benefit
and two-faced products worth the money
100% I love them so fucking much all we
have a hater stop using ash a five times
darker than your skin you're a pasty
vision you need to learn how to do your
makeup well well honey if you had a
fucking profile picture maybe I could
read you to filth as well you dumb dog
biggest pet peeve when it comes to
makeup well hon I fucking hate doing my
eyebrows I wish they were tattooed on
and I didn't have to touch them what is
your zodiac sign
I am a Virgo so all my virgos how about
you bitch comment down below if you're a
Virgo I want to know love them someone
asked what is your opinion on the
jeffree star controversy so my opinion
on that is nothing because I've always
loved Jeffery and I always will we
obviously all make mistakes with what we
say and what we do
apologies are made but some people don't
accept those apologies which is fine
however people make mistakes in their
life and I think everybody needs to
accept that because I'm sure everyone
has made some mistake in their lifetime
and I praise Jeffery for apologizing for
everything that's happened
over the past 15 years and yeah let's
just leave it at that
who is your celebrity crush my celebrity
crush is 125 thousand percent Bradley
Cooper and Zac Efron imagine them two on
the same

time at dick and balls um
pro and long oh my god this bitch wet
and I'm living if you had to either
swallow come before every meal or wear a
g-string 24/7 for a year what would you
do
ah what the fuck is that
I would probably I honestly can't answer
that just leave it to your imagination
Hans what would I do what do you think I
would do would you rather give up
highlighter or fake lashes I would
definitely give up highlighter I mean
highlighters not that big of a necessity
in my makeup collection definitely
lashes are though cuz check them out

get those amazing lips well hon you can
thank miss Alex pike for those amazing
juicier lookin ass lips
