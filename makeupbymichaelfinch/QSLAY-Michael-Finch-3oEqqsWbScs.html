today I thought it would be cool to do a
Q&amp;amp;A since I have not done one in a
stupid of a long time and you guys have
got a lot of questions for me so I'm
going to try and answer as many as I can
I want this video which is not great for
too long well it gets draining you know
what I mean so I asked you guys on
Twitter if you don't follow me on
twitter follow me now I'll leave it
right here on the screen because I post
a lot on Twitter ok so the first
question is when will bendy merch be
available well you know what one day it
will be it will be so funny if we got
cleaned emerged now so those who don't
know who Vindhyas she is one of my best
friend's dog and I'm literally obsessed
with her we talk to each other we speak
to each other even though she's a dog
it don't matter because we literally
connect so well and I love her so much
and I'm going to kidnap her what I'm
going to dognapped her one day so
thinking what have you eaten today well
today I woke up and I had a piece of
toast with avocado and two boiled eggs
for lunch I had a lemon rosemary hotpot
with two handfuls of spinach and for
dinner I had lettuce tacos and a green
juice what is something that you would
like to say to all of your fans okay
first of all I don't see you guys as
fans I see as friends I see you as
viewers I hate calling my followers and
subscribers fans because I feel like
when I do that it's just I don't know it
just makes me feel icky like Kim
Kardashian house fans okay like she's a
celebrity I'm not a celebrity I'm just
like everybody else that makes videos
I'm just like everybody else a celebrity
is someone who is walking down the
street everybody knows who they are and
that's not me so I like to see you guys
as like just friends followers people
who watch me viewers probably viewers is
the best way to call you guys a message
for you all is literally I love you guys
so much you guys have all changed my
life completely YouTube is my career now
YouTube is my job and I'm so happy I can
say that it's something that I've
literally always wanted to do I've
always wanted to make videos inspire
people play with makeup play with new
products just everything like that and
I'm so grateful for you guys each and
every single day I wake up thinking
about YouTube I go to bed thinking about
- who was your childhood celebrity crush
Oh Zac Efron seriously next question how
is your last going in a five words
amazing amazing amazing
changing amazing that's I don't know who
like everything is just so good right
now I'm so content I'm so happy with my
life at the moment everything is going
in the right direction I'm not taking
anything for granted so like I don't
normally take anything for granted so if
something hits me in the face and it's
not going to be a shock for me but right
now at the moment everything is going
incredible so thank you for us how long
did it take you to accumulate all of
your makeup so I've been enjoying
YouTube for probably like I don't know
four years
but I've been taking it seriously for
about - maybe I don't really know how to
ever answer this question because I just
don't but um it's taken me a while I've
got a lot and I do need to get some what
Alex towards which like to draw to make
er I want to get two more sets of them
because I want to have all high end in
one and then all drugstore in one so
when I want to do a drugstore I can just
go straight pick out on my and then
it's all good if you wanna do a high-end
one I just go so you pick out all my
 and I'm all good you know what I'm
saying and I like to be really organized
with my makeup and everything is social
in there like my last straw is actually
cooked it's not full I can't even
I can't even go in there that's how much
OCD has given me what is your favorite
alcohol thank you the written thinking
my favorite alcohol is a Belvedere or
Grey Goose straight off the rocks
stunning amazing if you drink expensive
vodka you do not get hungover bitch if
you are drinking Smirnoff and you get
the worst hangovers change to Val Verde
or Grey Goose I can assure you you will
not be hungover at all and I seriously
hate hangovers so when I drink that
video and Grey Goose well what's your
favorite makeup product and why okay
it's probably not going to come to a
shock to anyone but tart shaped cake
honestly honestly it is everything a lot
of people do ask me where I get these
from because they are and exclusive to
Ulta in America I'm 99.9% sure you can
get them off Tarte website I'm actually
on tardy a leaf I'm very lucky and I do
get sent some
also my friend gave me like seven a
while ago so I'm pretty sucked up on
this this is in the shade light
light is my favorite color it's just so
oh so good can you do an American accent
oh now I don't want anyone to get
offended when I do this so I'm not here
to offend anyone someone asked me to do
it so i'ma do it hi everyone so today
I'm going to be trying to do a makeup
tutorial on this look right here so
basically what that is horrible
I am an embarrassment to Americans that
literally sound like I was going to take
a or something that did not sound
good at all so sorry
two Americans if I embarrassed you would
you ever have an affair with Chris Fox
oh yeah I'd rather die no seriously I
love Chris so much I'm actually go visit
him in New Zealand soon because I miss
his bitch ass what was the hardest thing
about makeup to learn for you like
eyeliner eyeshadow etc the hardest thing
about makeup for me to learn was how to
put on false lashes and blend
black eyeshadow when I first started
doing makeup
I'd be like to my client I was literally
doing clients for free or charging like
twenty dollars at the time I'd be like
no no no you don't need to like
eyeshadow no no you don't need lashes
now Mike you need black
eyeshadow you need four glands
Lilly ghalichi Hutu Beauty up in this
 bitch you need everything
so it just the more you learn sorry the
more you practice the better you get the
more confident you get with everything
now I can't grow a look without putting
lashes on honest to god I'm obsessive
lashes I'm obsessive black eye shadow
full glam everything like that so it's
all about practice keep on going don't
give up I can assure you you will get
there what Nationals what nationality
are you I am a failure no my nationality
so what I mean how did I anyway
Australian deaf my answer if your name
wasn't Michael what would you want it to
be mmm I've always loved the name on a
starchy are always so if I got to choose
I would want my name to be uh Nastasia
Finch while that sounds really gross not
a good work uh Nastasia team Remy or
Nikki
well obviously Nikki I've been a
longtime nickimja noise surfboard a Gaga
gaga
who the is Remy anyway oh where in
the world would you love to travel
through the most loved
love you too I have never actually been
out of Australia I literally got my
passport last week and I feel like I can
go anywhere in the world tomorrow if I
wanted to so the place that I really
want to go the most is America I feel
like I would just love it so much every
time I talk about LA New York everyone's
like oh that's dirty like it's not as
good as you'd expect it to be but our
all places may have to be amazing like
everyone thinks Australia is so amazing
and clean and everything well it's like
a not reality check so I'm keen to go to
America and I just want to walk I want
to do that walk to the Hollywood sign I
imagine touching that Hollywood sign
amazing how do you have so much
confidence I believe I have so much
confidence truly because of YouTube when
I first started youtube I was like hey
guys welcome back to my channel today
I'm going to be showing you how to do a
wing and now I'm like hey bitch welcome
back to my channel
Vladdy blah blah blah you know what I
mean I feel like YouTube has given me so
much confidence and you guys have given
me so much support in feeling better in
myself and making me feel loved are you
going to be at IMATS this year so I'm
pretty sure I'm actually in like June
July this year and I select that's way
too close to the last I'm at I don't
actually know if I'm going to go I don't
think I am but I could go who knows so
if you follow me on social media I'll
definitely keep everybody updated about
that if you weren't a youtuber slash
makeup artist what other job would you
like to do honestly I have no
idea I cannot imagine my life without
makeup and YouTube it's honestly
everything I honestly don't even know
how to answer that question
that's how is it makeup in youtube I
seriously am okay guys this is going to
be the last question for today because I
know this video is gone for ages so far
do you think the shooter Beauty palette
is worth it 100% of my favorite
eyeshadow palette to date it is
literally everything I try not to use it
in every single tutorial that I filmed
because I know people would get sick of
it but I am honestly obsessed with it
everything in there everything blends
the formula the only thing I don't like
about it is the like the shimmery colors
on the top they're a little bit hard to
use by all the matte off like that
whole palette is literally so versatile
I could talk about it for days
there are many looks you can do in that
palette and the black blends sorry well
it doesn't blend are evil all the other
colors it blends like underneath them
and like when I don't know it's hard to
explain I'm literally obsessed with a
shoe WT palette sorry if you're my cup
lava and you daren't aren't it you need
to get it I can assure you you will
 diarrhea all over the walls
anyway guys that's all the time I have
for today so I hope you guys really
enjoyed this video and it gave you a
little bit more information about myself
also another question that I was asked a
lot and I totally forgot to say people
kept asking how old I am I'm 20 years
old I'm from Australia and yeah anyway
guys I love you all so much and I will
see you all in my next video bye see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
