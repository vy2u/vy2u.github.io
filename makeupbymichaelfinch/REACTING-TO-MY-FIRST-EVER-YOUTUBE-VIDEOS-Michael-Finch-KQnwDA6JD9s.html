me a few questions about makeup I'm a
shadow or that my life like all that
sort of so yeah she's about to come
in so I will just welcome her aboard
with me I'm going to ask you to do one
more thing
I literally just kind of got to get over
how like different I look like I look so
different
sorry different here we go top 13 that
makeup mistakes ever made hey guys
so I've been requested to do this video
quite a lot and it's pretty much just
going to be the top 10 most common
makeup mistakes puberty has done wonders
and so has Botox and lip filler because
what the is this and my hair it
literally comes out the sides like and
not like another pair of ears and
actually did they squat down to the top
back these makeup mistakes that really
get to me if they work for you then go
ahead and do it I'm not fast but this is
the things that I don't sorry actually
seeing and I would love them all to be
fixed I'm not saying that I'm a
professional and I don't make mistakes
but this is what I've noticed no privacy
veneers and this is what I'd like for
everyone to approve upon so step one is
getting your right foundation I bet that
Instagram haters have come for me after
this one wrong shade of foundation when
you I mean like I think do the wrong
shade of foundation on me I'm like fake
tan or just I like really yellow
foundation sometimes I mean I just
okay hard but the problem is foundation
what you need to do is you need to test
it from here to here don't us on your
hand because it's more redness on your
hand and that is still true so thank you
as you can see how that goes and you're
always better off getting a foundation
that is a little bit better off getting
your foundation lighter will tend to
grow darker over the days especially
after you so to make up the power by
let's stop that video guys so today I'm
going to be showing you how to get this
winged out cat my guy this is inspired
by I'm pretty sure names both fast
makeup on Instagram I'm not sure what
she's on YouTube but I saw a thing and I
thought well I'd give it a shot oh my
god so cute
that may turn straight like I honestly
look at this I'm like definitely than me
like I changed sorry much and the thing
about you know YouTube and like as I
uploaded videos over the years
everyone's like not everyone but like
some specific individuals or always like
I'm getting a big head and you're saying
to get like a really up yourself no
there's a difference between that and
getting confidence everyone should know
that I'll just I don't stray primer by
benefit
