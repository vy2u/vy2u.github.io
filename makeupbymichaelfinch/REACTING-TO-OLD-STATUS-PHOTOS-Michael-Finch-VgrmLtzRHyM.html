as you can see something is a little bit
different here first of all well I've
actually done the video with my old
background but I'm back to my old
background because it is my favorite
background ever and I also now have some
new lighting I've actually got a ring
light so I feel like that lighting has
improved Oh much like it makes such a
big difference and I'm literally
obsessed with these little rings in my
eyes
I just can't before I get started in
today's video I just want to say thank
you so much for a hundred thousand
subscribers that is a ton of people
never ever what I have imagined to ever
hit that number at all like it's just
crazy and I love you guys so much like
every single one of you whether you
subscribe ages ago and you don't even
watch my videos anymore you just still
subscribe to me just because I still
love you and I just want to like reach
through the screen and hug all of you
because that is seriously amazing and
I'm so so happy and I didn't really have
an end-of-year goal but I was hoping
that I would be at 50,000 now I'm in a
hundred thousand I mean so yeah I just
want to say that before I got started
sorry in today's video I'm gonna be
reacting to old Facebook statuses and
I'm gonna be showing you guys some
photos of what I used to look like when
I was younger I mean you are not ready
let's go let's start off with the photo
of me in here I don't even know but guys
you are going to gag are you ready what
the actual um I don't even know
what is going on because first of all my
nose was so much smaller back then and
guys I didn't even have eyebrows they
are literally that is my natural eyebrow
that's what it actually looks like my
lips are non-existent I don't know where
where they were at that point in time
and I'm just like a chubby little boy
and I still am but I'm not as little
anymore you know what I'm saying uh and
also have something to point out that
this was my hair color it's like a
strawberry blonde but now it's this
brown color so it's changed completely
so bored so yeah this is my
natural color here this is obviously
bleached and Torrent on the top this
silvery sort of color but yeah this is
my natural hair color
that's what it used to look like oh can
we go so I'm pretty sure that was me in
year 7 and this is me in year 8 not much
difference besides the hair guys take a
moment this is a grease ball KFC bucket
 fest there's a close-up for you I'm
sure you'd appreciate that so as we can
see my nose is a little bit bigger here
which is not surprising at all my hair
is literally so greasy like I'm not
gonna lie to you guys I never used to
really wash my hair now I wash my hair
every day which a lot of people say it's
too much which I know it is but I just
can't sleep without having clean hair is
that normal
once again my lips are non-existent and
a lot of people ask about this scar like
blemish thing that I've got under my eye
here I've had that my whole life
it hasn't changed size or color it's
always been there a lot of people don't
notice it but some of you do but yeah
that's just what I've had it for my
whole entire life now let's look at some
old statuses yeah now I was one to post
probably 20 statuses in a day especially
when I was at school and be like I'm in
science I'm in IT
I mean English oh my god just got kicked
out of re oh my god okay so you know
those sunglasses that you used to get at
the cinema when you went to see a 3d
movie I used to not the lenses out of
those and wear them in public I mean um
I don't know what's going on with my
hair I don't know what's going on with
that on my hair but I know I'm
wearing a jeffree star merchandise the
bracelet I used to collect them is to
have Sora Sora many I hate that is
disgusting I don't even know what is
around my head I think it's like a staff
or just a piece of black material that I
tied up to try and make look like a
bandanna ah my fingers my fingernails
they will not exist in either I included
l dirtier under there and can we
just talk about the background I'm in a
bathroom with a I don't even know what
that is and my phone case obviously it's
real Chanel guys from eBay my t-shirt is
Geoffrey star not surprising I used to
have sorrow of many of his t-shirts just
thinkers I think I've still got a few
left okay so this goddess was posted in
November 2016 2010 which was six years
ago and it says remember that girl that
I got pregnant that murdered those
people yeah I've got stuck with the baby
ha ha ha I
no idea what I'm talking about her I
never got anyone pregnant just look like
I would get anyone pregnant I mean see I
don't know what the was going on I
don't know what the I was talking
about either our typical I used to
always make these statuses boards like
this and I'll tell you what I miss about
you when I see those goddesses like to
this day I'm just like really like
really or like for any Inbox
oh really either desperate to talk to
people maybe you should make some new
friends so I was one of those people who
used to write my feelings about other
people all over Facebook so this one
says this was back in 2000 and down as
well no one cares about all your shits
sorted out you're messed up like I was
using it as a diary I could never ever I
probably put to this day on Facebook I
put quotes and stuff on there but I'll
never be lack on there god you're such a
bitch like sort your out I'll just
go straight to the person if that ever
happens I need no Facebook 2010 just got
called a ho sad face well if I was
called a hoe to this day I really want
to give two shits tbh I like
this one Janis Ian Dyke I used to quote
story much on there I hope I wasn't
the only one I used to do that I don't
think I was because my friends used to
be the same as mean by doing that lack
of G sinks well that's classy 1111 with
heaps of love hearts I remember that I
used to purse calluses like 1111 every
single night and I know I look back and
I'm like what the like why ah this
one's funny November 8 2010 and just got
these amazing dolce gabbana studies
what's so funny about that is that they
were fake and probably from eBay or from
the market because I remember I had a
job Chang Gabbana hoodie as well we'd
like to sign here never again
look have a look at some more photos
yeah I really don't know what to say
about this my hair my I would never ever
go back to that you know when like you
go back and look at old photos of
yourself and you're like what the
hell was I thinking I'm scared that I'm
gonna go back to looking back to this
day and think what the hell was I
thinking like am i doing anything wrong
down
I don't know oh my god okay so this
photo um I just learned how to use
Photoshop and I learned how to use the
airbrush tool I still don't know what
makeup was back then I didn't wear
makeup at all um so yeah I really just
use the airbrush tool all over and yeah
I remember posting that on Jeffery stars
wall because I was wearing his t-shirt
and I've got the little logo that I put
in the corner there that's beside the
point
anyway I posted this photo Jeffrey
starts Facebook all and he commented
damn you know how to Photoshop now that
was literally ten ten years ago that was
six years ago
so I let it go now I don't know if he
was throwing shade or not I don't think
he was I was basically obsessed with him
back then so anything he said to me even
if he called me like something horrible
which he never did I would still love
him because that's how obsessed I was
with him back in the day so he said that
on the Facebook photo I'll insert a
screenshot if I can find it but I'm yeah
I don't I didn't know at the time
whether to take that as an insult or as
a compliment but mm or an arm and this
is the last photo that we are going to
look at today because this is just the
end of days I'm telling you at the end
of days I thought I was like a scene emo
King a scene Queen do you guys remember
that era where that was like a massive
deal like I know we've all been through
our emo phase but I'm that hair though
or the Edit of the airbrushing on my
face we're even on my lips like what
even our lives back in that I probably
didn't even know what they were like
what are they and as I said before I
used to collect all those Geoffrey start
like wristbands and stuff and as you can
see I probably got about sitting on my
arms right now
and here's t-shirt and I don't know what
that necklace is but it's probably a
piece of for the cost me a dollar
on eBay anyway guys I hope you enjoyed
this video and found something new about
me today if you did don't forget to give
me a thumbs up and I love you guys so
much and I'll see you all in my next
video
