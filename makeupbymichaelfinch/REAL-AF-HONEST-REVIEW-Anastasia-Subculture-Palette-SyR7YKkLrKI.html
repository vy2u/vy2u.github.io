channel so today I'm gonna be doing a
full review on the subculture palette by
uh Nastasia Beverly Hills
now this eyeshadow palette has literally
been murdered on social media at the
past like three to four weeks now being
honest I have actually not watched any
reviews on this I have just seen
thumbnails and I've heard things that
they are very chalky and they don't
blend the reason why I haven't watched
any myself is because I want to have my
own opinion of this my true honest
opinion
I love Anastacio I love her I love
novena I love the products that they
come out with but apparently this isn't
all that great
so let's give it a whirl
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start
off with my favorite product to prime my
eyes with which is the taut shaped tape
so I'm just gonna prime them as per
usual let's get into the pallets so here
it is here so the colors are pretty okay
I don't really know what I'm gonna do
with this overall palette itself but um
let's find out so first of all I'm gonna
be taking this shade here called dawn
okay super powdery but doesn't mean it's
a bad eye shadow so I'm gonna pop that
in my crease sir I'm gonna zoom you guys
get a little bit more all right so just
so you guys can see fully up close I'm
gonna bring this through my crease and
just kind of blend it all the way up
all right so so far this color isn't
very pigmented but I don't think it's
meant to be all that pigmented because
it is kind of like a transition he's
sort of shade but it's blending out well
so I'm just gonna keep going each time I
do go into the palette to pick up
product this is what happens so um yeah
next I'm going to take this shade here
called new wave well it is so powdery
I'm just gonna pop a new way with my
outer corner and once again through my
crease guys I literally have no idea
what I'm actually doing here right here
right now so I'm a little concerned okay
that color blended out Wow still no idea
what I'm doing now I'm gonna take the
shade here called fudge and what I'm
gonna do with the fudge is I'm just
gonna pop it on my out of V and kind of
stop blending this I put it through my
crease okay
okay what is it doing its could be our
problem so I'm packing on fudge okay now
I'm gonna take my other brush and a
little bit of New Wave and I'm gonna see
if I can blend this out oh my god
okay so I don't know what's happened
here but it's kind of like really
pigmented here and then it's really
payment in here and then nothing
sticking to here like it's gone really
like more so patchy never get through
here again
let's pack on my fudge
okay let's see if we can blend out fudge
so far so good nothing's really
up all so bad yet it's gonna take some
more of new ways because I kind of lost
my transition that was my fault not the
palette and kind of pop some new wave
just above here okay
I don't see anything bad about that look
so far now I'm going to take the shade
here called rowdy and I'm gonna pop that
on my out of thee and I kind of bring it
up here a bit and onto my lid now I'm
taking a little bit more fudge and a
blend over that
he's gonna add a little bit more of that
black color on my eye cold rowdy and I'm
actually gonna bring the rowdy up
through my crease ever so slightly guys
I'm not saying anything bad about this
palette like so far it's perfectly fine
like to me that looks fine like what's
wrong with that fall out that's
obviously gonna happen it's an eyeshadow
palette guys I'm just gonna do exactly
the same on the other eye so I'm just
gonna bring up fudge through my crease
and kind of just pop it in here guys
literally nothing bad is happening right
now with this I should have he'll it
like is blending it's not going patchy
like to me that looks fine am I just not
seeing something that everyone else is
seeing now for my lip color I'm going to
be taking this shade called
a dawn just gonna take that on just a
flat brush with no fix plus okay this is
where it could all go downhill it's
literally just flaking off is that was
it me
well it's bringing out a lot of texture
on my eyelid it's gonna add a little bit
of fix+ to my brush to see if this
changes and it stays but uh it's not bad
you guys it's not bad but it's not the
best eye shadow okay I don't know if you
guys can see close up but it's very
textured on my eyelid and it looks so
flaky and dry it doesn't look good at
all other than that so far everything
else is being pretty good I'm actually
just gonna take a little bit more rowdy
and kind of darken up this out of V huh
just kind of bring that black through my
crease
you can't know what happened there
all right so I'll just added a ton
of black and it's super super patchy so
what I'm gonna do is kind of take fudge
and see if I can just blend throughout
the black to make it blend in
I'm going to take fudge and blend over
that black again and take some more of a
dawn and kind of just go over the edges
of where I just put all that black okay
so I don't actually know what's happened
in the process of all this but I don't
know if you guys can see but it's
literally are you guys seeing that it's
gone sweeper patchy and like I'm trying
to make I'm trying to make fudge work
but I'm struggling so I'm gonna bring
fudge across where it's all patchy why
is it doing that like why is it just
 stuck there like what the hell
that was going so well and then I wanted
to add more black and then it just
 itself like I'm trying to add
more black now oh my god what
the actual what is this what is
this bean Jay oh my god I'm super
disappointed I thought it was going so
well
and then just decided to literally
itself that's a problem the count of the
thoughts okay so this is definitely
cooked itself and if I start just clean
up underneath my eye and I'm just gonna
take a little bit of the top shake check
because I do want to get these all the
colors a bit of a guard
I mean I wasn't to do my full-on face
after this but what's the point now that
my eyeshadows cooked now let's try some
different colors out because I do want
to give you guys a bit of like an idea
about the rest of the palette let's take
the shade here called untamed so take
this on a small definer brush
and then Upson take a little bit of
shade here called destiny and I'm just
gonna blend out that green with destiny
I mean there's nothing wrong with these
shades
phase two green shades are blending out
really Wow but I just can't get over
what's going on on there like what man
what what being D now to take a little
bit of shade here called cube I'm going
to put that on me in a corner oh it's
got like a pinky iridescent to it oh I
kind of like that what on my brow bar
and I just want to give you guys like a
full rundown at this palette okay that's
definitely not good for a brow bar and
highlight but we do that for next time
now do I want to go we're going so well
until that black eye shadow I just
wanted to make it a little bit more and
like fudge is not blending over it and
like it's all caught up up on here like
what is going on like what what anyway
guys I'm gonna leave the video at this
my overall review on the palette is I
honestly don't know I don't know what's
happened here for this to occur
I might actually give it another girl in
another video soon but I'm really
disappointed because the black seriously
just itself on my literal eyelid
to be honest I'm not one to sort of go
for a palette that has these colors in
it because I just look at them and I
think like what am I gonna do like you
can either do green or you can do like a
brown eye with a bit of Burgundy do not
I mean like there's not really much in
here modern Renaissance is totally my
scene but I'm gonna have to give this a
big no-no for now I don't like it and
that takes to shade the textured shade
that does protection is these choose
this shade here called a dawn really did
let me down I didn't try this one but I
would not use this car anyway it's like
a like a like a holographic sort of
green so um yeah anyway I hope you guys
really enjoyed this video and you
learned something about this palette if
you want to give if you want me to give
it another go let me know because I'll
be keen to try it out again and try and
do a different look because I don't like
what's happening here right here right
now I love you guys so much and I will
see you all in my next video bye see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
