today I thought I would do something a
little different I've seen quite a few
people drew this as of late and I
thought I would join in on the trend and
do it myself
basically I am going to be recreating
one of you your guyses is that that's
not even a word I'm gonna be creating a
look that one of my subscribers slash
followers have done so I went onto my
Twitter and I asked you guys to send me
your looks and I was gonna choose one to
recreate and I found a girl that is so
 talented I can't even do her
name is Ellie
Attis her Instagram is on the screen
right now and she sent in for photos
there's that one but the one I'm gonna
be getting my inspire on is the one in
the middle the blue one I'm gonna try
and recreate that I think it's perfect
because I haven't done a blue like a
look in so long and I love the
way that looks so without any further
ado let's get straight into this video
and if you guys enjoyed make sure you
get a thumbs up I love you guys and
let's get into it
okay so going with my eyeshadow base
today I'm gonna be using the Kevyn
Aucoin
the sensual skin enhancer now I saw
someone uses that eyeshadow base the
other day and they said it was amazing
but I forget who it was
ah and it looks so good and they
said that their makeup just laid on top
of a perfectly so you only need a tiny
bit of this stuff because it's so potent
sorry just gonna use a little tiny bit
of it so I'm gonna use this to carve out
the brow at the top and I'm gonna use
that as my eyeshadow base as well
just gonna blend this out slightly I'm
just gonna set up with a little bit of
translucent powder just a little bit
just because I want to get maximum
pigment so Ali has used like quite a few
darker blues so I'm gonna go in with a
transition color first and I'm just
gonna be dipping into the BH Cosmetics
weekend festival palette the packaging
and this is so so nice like this is
inspiring me to do an eyeshadow look
based around these colors as well thumbs
up if I should do that let me know I'm
just gonna dip into this shade here
called Palooza pyjama a candle cut your
look and I'm gonna start whoa hello
pigments I'm gonna start by building
this up into my crease I have to keep
looking back at the fighter because I
keep forgetting like what I'm doing okay
we're all good and I'm gonna bring this
ensure my inner corner we're just
building up more color I don't know if
it's the eyeshadow that's pigmented or
if it's the base that I used but the
shadows are showing up so good now the
darker blue that I'm gonna go image
today is from the Marc Jacobs smart
Oriole palette it's like a really really
dark blue this one just here yes I'm
gonna be using this you use any dark
blue that you have by the way I just
reuse this one because it's so pigmented
just gonna dip into that and I'm gonna
go in on my out of a and I'm gonna stop
blending these two colors together I
love this so much
and I'm gonna bring this up throw my
Crais
was packin on ma on my inner corner and
slowly blending that up into the crease
area just taking a little bit more of
that transition shade that I used and
just popping it above the dark blue just
to kind of bring the smooth that
transition color back
now I'm just going to be taking a black
eyeshadow the one I'm using is Noah Noah
from the UH Nastasia soft glam palette
and I'm gonna pop that on my out of the
and I'm also gonna pop it on my inner
corner just blending it in slightly now
it's going to take a little bit on the
brush and I'm gonna join both of these
this is kind of creating a soft line
between the two now I'm just gonna go
back in with my dark blue and blend
around the edges of that black just to
blend out that line a little bit
so now for my eyelid part I'm gonna be
taking this little duty here this is
from BH Cosmetics this is the highlights
I color in the shade nolle it's like a
really nice blue eyes I've only just
come out so I thought I'd test them in
this video as well and I'm gonna use
this to kind of cut my crease a little
bit but instead of going directly in
with a the brush because it's a little
bit too big for my lacking it's gonna
pop some of this product onto the back
of my hand and just use a little brush
to do this part instead till
and I'm just gonna kind of blend this
out I think I put a little bit too much
on whoops
now once I've got that down straight
over the top I'm just gonna go back into
the BH Cosmetics festival palette and
take this shimmery blue shade just here
I'm just gonna pop this over the top of
that
now it's gonna take more if that Dhaka
blue from the mock Jacobs palette and
see how I can blend the edges in a
little bit with this lid
now let's gonna take a little bit more
black and just touch up the black on the
out of V and also just touch up the
black on the inner corner as well I
think I'm doing pretty well so far
now I'm just going to take an angle
brush and some of that black eyeshadow
and I'm just gonna run this along the
lash line now as you can see in the part
I at least put a little bit of glitter
on her lid so I'm gonna take the glitter
gypsy glitter off that I use the other
day in the video and I'm gonna just pop
a little tiny bit of this just on the
lid area just gonna take a little bit of
the two-faced glitter glue okay so I've
got a little bit of glitter going on my
eyelid area now for my mascara I'm just
gonna use some of the Mac extended play
guys for my lashes today I'm just gonna
be taking these ones from dull lashed by
dull beauty in the UK these are in the
style Chloe Elizabeth and they're so
large that's what they look like right
there dill I'm just gonna go ahead and
do the top of this eye and then we're
gonna come back clean up underneath the
eyes and finish off the entire look so
I'm really impressed with this so far
I've really liked it it's inspired me to
use color dull color
okay guys sorry I'm now back I finished
this side and I've just i rated the
bottom of my face because although the
full and everything like that I didn't
really like the way it was looking now
just going back to that further on
Twitter Ali has done all have lost it
damn okay so on the bottom of the eye
she's got kind of like black dark blue
and then just some glitter I'm also
gonna have something into my waterline
just to spice it up a little bit more -
sorry I'm just going to take a little
bit of the Marc Jacobs blue color from
that palette underneath my lash line
right up against it
and then just gonna head back into the
VH Cosmetics palette and take Palooza
the transition that I was using earlier
and I'm just going to blend that in
underneath the darker blue just adding
some more of the darker blue just to get
maximum pigment just gonna take some of
that black from a soft glam palette you
guys can use any black shade you want
I'm just gonna pop that right underneath
my lash line all the way across to my
inner corner
now don't think Ally's got liner on in
this but I'm just gonna pop someone
anyway this is the associate planner
from cap one day but I'm using it as a
peasant highlighter
hopefully this doesn't turn bad fix a
cake haul in the photo she's got a
little bit of glitter like just
underneath here sorry I'm just gonna pop
a little bit of action and remus car
after I'll jiggle it a fast all right so
let's gonna pop a little bit of the
two-faced glitter glue on the back of my
harnes I'm just gonna take a fluffy
brush and I'm just gonna pop on a little
bit that a little bit yeah now does
