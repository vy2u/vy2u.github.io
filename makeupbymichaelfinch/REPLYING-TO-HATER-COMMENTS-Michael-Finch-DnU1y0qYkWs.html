know I said a while ago on my snapchat
if you don't on snapchat then follow me
now it'll be on the screen right now
that I said on snapchat that I won't be
addressing any negativity and I just
want my channel to be positive
however reply to you how to comments
videos I find so fun to film and people
enjoy them so much so
not that this worries me in any way I'm
addressing these because it's fun to
film as a video these comments don't
mean like all these people are
literally dead to me so I don't give two
 shits about them but for the
second video I am gonna be doing a reply
to a comment so let's go
so these comments are from my Instagram
and from my YouTube so I'm just going to
be going off both of those social media
websites okay so the first one is so
funny there's this guy let me just read
it first of all he goes men are supposed
to be masculine not become a girl first
of all sit the down because I'm not
trying to become a girl I'm just a guy
who puts a make up on and it's 2016 like
get with the years like this
just pisses me off so much
and then someone replied to him and then
he goes this is why I support Trump and
I hope he wins because he's going to
make America straight again and then
basically he goes on to say that being
gay is a sin and that he hope America
becomes straight again first of all do
your research because I live in
Australia I'm not in America so Trump
has nothing to do with me second of all
you're 14 years old coming up all on my
Instagram why the are you on my
Instagram in the first place like
off and third of all I hope you go blind
from my blinding highlight sorry
you next one oh is that a man or a woman
I mean a lot of people comment this on
all of my just being a smartass
they know if you have to
question it then like oh it just doesn't
make sense to me like if you have to
quit question it then okay first of all
you being rude second of all it's
probably a guy because you're being a
 smartass too much foundation or
home I'm a makeup artist
do you not understand that we live in a
world where makeup artists can apply as
much makeup as they want and it doesn't
matter it's not like you have to go out
and wear this every single day there's
no such thing in my world is too much
foundation honey if I want to apply a
hundred layers of foundation that I
 will so
opinion up your ass because nobody asked
for it somebody else goes this is why
you take boys swimming on the first day
have you not seen me
I do not swim if anything I will either
drown or just float I have never known
how to swim second of all this makeup is
not coming off in the water I
should do like a test on this because
this is so hard to get off this
will not come off if you were to like go
into a pool like this is not going to
come off and also you kind of be an
asshole because you're saying that when
the makeup comes off I look really bad I
think I look pretty good and I'm pretty
happy with my stuff so you can eat a
dick does he realize that he is yellow
and I'm hard when in this situation
because a lot of the time 50% of the
time people like oh my god your
foundation is way too yellow you need of
what pink base or like a more warm base
one okay so I go out and get a more warm
base one and then I get called
Donald Trump and like a like an orange
like you just can't win social media you
just can't wait and I'm done oh he looks
constantly angry I'm assuming because of
my eyebrows my eyebrows are made me look
angry it's not like they're like all the
way up here sit the down bitch who
are you he's so ugly he scares me if you
don't have anything nice to say them why
comment anything in the first place like
okay this is so funny because a lot of
the time when I get hate comments
sometimes if I'm really pissed off I'll
go on to their profile and if they've
left me a hate comment I'll be like oh
my god you're so pretty and then they'll
turn around and be like oh my god I love
you so much your makeup videos are
amazing like yesterday for example some
little bitch left a comment on my
Instagram and goes oh that's so ugly
like you're so ugly and then I get an
email from her saying oh my god I love
your makeup so much like the things that
people would do for attention like so I
just can't work out it they're actually
hating or they just want attention
because there was another incident a few
weeks ago where someone was you know
having a go at me about something and I
replied to them and they literally said
I just wanted to reply from him what the
 somebody else goes when I get fat
and start balding I'll just start doing
makeup tutorials they get paid and the
girls love them first of all I don't
think I'm fat I'm just over way like
there's a difference between fat and
overweight I don't think I'm fat well
actually I do but that's beside the
point
second of all I'm not bold my hair lines
like it's not that bad it's not like
it's receding I just have a big forehead
deal with it and of course the girls
love me and so does your boyfriend so
here we go this is what I'm talking
about where I can't win this isn't only
a head comment it's more of like a
constructive criticism but I'm just over
it because I literally cannot win
you're an amazing makeup artist but your
foundation is the wrong color it's true
orange I would go for a more yellow
tinted one I find this one so funny this
girl goes the one thing women are
supposed to be better at men are taking
this from us to Lowell well clearly
I don't know what you are but you're a
 idiot if you think only women
and mentioning makeup if you're a guy
and you want to do makeup go for it
don't let anyone hold you back and
you're probably just jealous but I'm a
lot more talented than you are so you
can as I always say you can eat
a dick here we go here's another
one ass bleep you were
born a man stay a man once again I'm not
trying to become a girl I'm just
putting on makeup because it's fun oh my
god you're a man why do you do makeup is
it weirder when girls and women come up
to my profile and call me a and
stuff like they're the ones that I
thought would be more accepting I don't
mean to you know put a label on that but
they're the ones that I thought would be
more accepting as someone like me what
it's guys doing it's like yeah whatever
but when it's women doing it it's like I
mean you're probably just jealous
because my brows are better than yours
and I know how to actually blend eyes
shadow and the last one that we're going
to answer today is are you gay anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I
thought it would just be fun to address
a little bit of hate and also I want a
message to come across in this video is
if you get hate on the daily or if you
get a little bit of height here and
there just ignore it don't worry about
it I literally don't care about it okay
I just brush it off my shoulder keeping
you through and don't let the head get
you anyway guys I love you all so much
and I will see you all in my next video
bye
 so Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
