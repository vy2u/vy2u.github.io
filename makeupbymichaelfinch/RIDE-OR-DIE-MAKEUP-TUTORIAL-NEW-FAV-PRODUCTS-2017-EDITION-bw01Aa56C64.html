channel so today I'm going to be doing
an updated version of the Ronald I
makeup tutorial that I did in September
last year so basically a lot of products
that I used in that video and have now
changed completely to new products just
a couple are still the same I'll tell
you guys if that is claimed and why
they're the same but other than that
I've got a shit ton of products to show
you guys that I have been using in a lot
of videos but I've managed to put them
all into one so I can do an updated
rattle diet makeup tutorial for y'all
now instead of just sitting here and
showing you guys the products I'm
actually going to be putting them on and
talking about them as I go so you can
see how they work on my face without any
further ado let's get straight into this
video okay so I'm going to be starting
off with my fuck down here my eyebrows
today so I'm just going to brush through
them first
now if you guys have been watching my
channel for a while you know that I have
been loving and natural looking brows
like I've kind of been stirring away
from the whole Instagram like design
brow sometimes it just kind of happens
and I don't mean it to happen but it
just does so you know I can change my
eyebrows every day I can do whatever the
fuck I want with them so yeah so my brow
product situation hasn't really changed
much
I've always been using the benefit you
know brow products and there's been my
favorite for such a long time now so I'm
just going to be taking the benefit of
browsing brow kit and I'm just going to
kind of draw on the end of my brow cuz I
like to like make it a little bit longer
on the ends and then I'm gonna grab a
little bit of powder from that brow kit
and just kind of fill that in then what
I do is I just take the powder from the
brow Zing's and just go straight up on
up in here and kind of just follow the
natural well that sucks then isn't it
and I just kind of follow the natural
shape of my brows and just kind of fill
them in you know the natural shape that
they already are my brows used to be so
skinny like I never thought I would say
this but when I first started doing
makeup I don't know if you guys have
been like how long you've been following
me for but when I first started taking
YouTube super seriously and had a pink a
glittery like sequin background and that
at that stage that's when my brows will
literally start
back here and they went up I'm not even
kidding they were literally cooks they
just went up like this and out like that
everyone was like your eyebrows make you
look evil I'm Michael I love them and I
did love them at the time but now I look
back at that I'm like oh my god everyone
was right so like you just go through
phases with brows and just with makeup
in general like you know I used to love
to Instagram brows up now I'm just you
know all about that February feathery
fluffy sort of brow look insane once my
browser all filled in I'm into integrity
at benefit gimme brow this basically
just liked insta brow hairs show you
guys are aware of what this product does
and just kind of brushing that through
my brows really need to get tinted ASAP
by the way if any of you guys know of
any boutiques in Brisbane who do like
lash and brow
tinting and like waxing and all that
stuff can you leave a comment down below
because I really need to buy one
ASA not Gold Coast just Brizzy I'm
traveling a narrow strip my brows are
merciless now moving on to concealer
pause this video and comment down below
if you know what it's going to be I mean
it's pretty obvious tart shaped a pinky
I'm just going to be concealing
underneath my brows with this no brand
has top to this yet when a new concealer
comes out from a brand I'm normally all
over it so I'll be waiting and I'll let
you guys know as soon as I do know this
is the highest coverage concealer I've
ever used in my actual life oh fuck it's
got to wet the Beauty Blender and I'm so
comfortable I'm not getting up keen so I
just drown this motherfucker in our
sprout makeup setting spray not our
problem now I'm just gonna further take
that concealer down onto my eyelid area
now it's gonna take my sponge and blend
all of this concealer out ah shit oh my
god there's leftover powder on this
sponge so it just all caked up on my lid
no problem that's what happens when you
don't wash your fucking sponges kids and
we'll just wipe that off okay I'm not
having no cakey base or my fuckin
eyelids so so I first instead I'm just
going to take to the other side of the
sponge where there is no powder on there
now to set that in place I'm just going
to take the dermablend prep
or setting powder there the thing I love
about this powder is number one it's not
the RTM a or the courteous one because I
have been using that in every single
video ever since I started no not really
but for a very long time and it was time
to change it up this is available in
price pay and also I think I paid $60
for it
it doesn't have flash back but everyone
has their opinions about that which is
fine I believe I can knock all the flash
back off because I take photos of /
after using this all the time and I
thanks for ages sometimes and I've never
had a problem with it but I'm might not
like to some people with that's totally
fine I'm just brushing over a little bit
more powder just to really get in there
make sure everything is set so we don't
have any trouble blending out our eye
shadow now moving on to eye shadow y'all
are probably getting real sick of me
using this but I haven't used it in
quite a while so please don't come for
me so eyeshadow I'm going to be using
the creative Beauty rose text of rose
gold eyeshadow palette last time in my
last rider diet with diamond stuck to a
Beverly Hills Modern Renaissance palette
and they are both two of my favorite
eyeshadow palette but I haven't done
this rattled eye makeup tutorial tag in
such a long time and this is what taken
over the Anastacio sorry
yeah so I'm going to see if I can to a
look that I haven't done before or like
a different style but don't count on it
because I don't know what's going to
happen so I was going to dig into the
shade called BAE and what I'm going to
do is just pop this off really my clean
you know and I'm just this isn't going
to add really any color I'm just going
to put it down just so there's something
there on top of the translucent powder
that we put down so we can blend out our
shadows so I'm just going to dip into
the color called sandalwood which is
this black brown shade and imma pop this
in my crease and start building this up
oh so slowly start bringing this through
okay once I've blended that all three of
my crease I'm going to take the shade
Hana okay I've probably done this before
guys but just chill chill out and I'm a
popped up in my outer V but then what I
want to do is kind of do like a halo
sort of effect so I'm going to pop this
on that inner corner as well and avoid
that middle part like this part here and
then blend that out with a little bit
more
in the word now I do believe it is time
to start making this more intense so I'm
just going to take a smaller brush and
I'm going to start packing on henna and
building this up so it's quite dark now
I'm going to take from black truffle and
I'm going to start packing this on to
the outer V and the inner corner now I'm
going to take a little bit of cocoa
which is that burgundy color sort of
thing I'm just going to pop this above
black truffle okay moving on to my
eyelid color I'm going to be taking the
morphe pressed pigment in the shade
powder room if you guys have not tried
at multi pigments before diddly done
they are fucking amazing they are so wet
and buildable and pigmented and stunning
and they are so cheap at the same time
so I'm going to take a little bit on my
brush and just give it a quick spritz
you know pack it on to the center of my
lid and bring it up
oh but okay after thats done I'm just
going to take my blending brush and just
kind of blend up around those edges now
I'm just going to be taking a little bit
of the Urban Decay Midnight Cowboy
glitter liner this shit is everything
and I'm just going to put this all over
my lid area and kind of like up here
flunkin it anywhere I want not our
problem
this is looking like it's kind of turned
into like some fucking cut crease sort
of shit but that's fine I know it's cute
okay I can go with that hey guys I'm
still quickly jump off camera to the
other eye and I will be back and back
now that my eyes are all done or my eye
shadow let's move on to eyeliner now
this is not change I don't even know if
I used it in my last video but is the
Engler AMC gel liner it is literally
amazing not a problem it's the blackest
eyeliner I've literally ever used in my
actual lettera life so I'm just going to
apply it straight against my lash line
I'm not going to do a wing hopefully
okay so just a line straight against my
lashline it's gonna be easier to hide
the lash band now moving on to mascara
I'm going to be taking the benefit
roller lash mascara for some reason I've
changed back to this from the Too Faced
better than sex I always change up my
mascara don't know why but I do and I've
been loving this a lot lately so my
lashes today I'm just going to be taking
the Buddha Beauty lashes in this style
Lana
number 10 crew - beauty kicks ass with
her lashes all the time and I'm
literally obsessed with them so I'm just
going to be taking a little bit of the
House of lashes black lash glue that has
not changed
inna I still use this glue because it is
a Holy Grail that is so stunning okay
now go to my lashes are on and I'm
having a bit I had a bit of trouble like
doing this a good apartment you know
like to some literary ah I know it's a
little bit different to the other side
but it's so hard when you've got like an
uneven eye shape like the skin fold I
don't know how to explain it but there's
extra like a line here so it like folds
in and it's so annoying I'm just going
to take a Neutrogena makeup wet and just
clean up underneath my eyes okay pretty
is now that my eyes are all done let's
move on to the skin so today I'm going
to be using the backup backlight primer
this is just fucking stunning it is so
stunning I really want to try out the
Marc Jacobs a gel highlighter it looks
so good I was about to buy the other day
and I was like look I need to save a
little bit of money but knowing me I
probably just go to Brisbane and cocking
gun store and buy it as if it's in stock
this just gives your skin like such a
beautiful glow like can you see that
it's just it's stunning it's so exciting
but my foundation today I'm going to be
using my favorite combo I know a lot of
people don't like it when people mix
foundations because it's just harder I
guess but sorry I have to show you guys
my favorite combo this is the Georgia
Armani luminous silk foundation and the
Lancome Lancome
TI's all ultra we're 24 hours I don't
know why I like to mix these it's just
because I do and I just think it's just
a stunning stunning result you know
what I mean I feel like when you mix
foundations it just makes everything
amazing and just absolutely stunning so
if you promise up the Giorgio Armani and
a few pumps of the then compounding at
home I'm just going to mix that up and
then I'm just going to do it all over my
face now I'm going to take my damp
sponge and just blend it out and just
watch the magic happen like it is so it
is stunning it is so stunning it is full
coverage it looks amazing it looks like
skin you know I'm just going to be
adding a little bit more to make cheeks
and just Brad feel like I need that
little bit more coverage okay moving
back on to concealer kite-shaped tape
all over my forehead and my t-zone area
now just going to do the under eye area
let's just go with that much and see how
that goes absolutely stunning this
concealer never fails me ever or yes to
settle that I'm just going to be taking
the adrenaline to professional setting
powder once again we want to bake that
concealer and my whole nose and just
complete a baking on my forehead as well
and just basically everywhere up with
the concealer you know now my foundation
powder Wow my foundation powder has not
changed at all either is the Australis
fresh and flawless thank you I think
anything could ever top this just that
fuckin good this will just add extra
coverage and also set the foundation you
can use like a translucent powder but I
like this because it adds a bit of extra
coverage you know now just to do a
little bit of contouring today I'm going
to be taking the cooler light version
and I'm just going to start chiseling
away at my face slowly but surely you
know it's my favorite part
changes everything on catfish King I'm
just gonna run a little bit down the
side of my nose like I always do because
it always gets lost in the concealer and
I let it really look like Voldemort
which is a good thing to keep my nose

more money on makeup get under the
bottom lip like just look at what this
is done to my face do I say more you

taking si a two-faced lip injection
