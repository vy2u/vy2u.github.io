let's just get straight into it and I'm
going to be using my uh Nastasia dip
brow pomade to kind of create my brows
as I do in every other video so I mixed
blonde and chocolate together like I did
last time
and yeah I'm basically just making a
whole new shape and filling them in and
they're quite big I just got the waxed
they are look at that difference anyway
then I'm moving on to concealer just to
conceal my brows and I'm using the
Maybelline age rewind concealer super
high coverage and it's quite thick so
I'm kind of obsessed with that can we
also just ignore the fact that I'm
missing out I know it's really really
ratchet then I'm taking some Mac prep
and prime essential oils onto my brush I
was talking to my friend about this he
works at Mac Jacob and he was just
saying that it's like really good for
dry skin and stuff like mixing with
foundation so I just tried it out and it
was really good I really like to finish
that I had so yeah basically then I'm
just taking that toothbrush brush I got
off eBay for like $2 I'll leave the link
down below if I can find it again and
yeah I just caked my face on with that
and it does really really really good
coverage then I'm moving back to my
Maybelline anti age rewind concealer
once again and just blending that out
with my Beauty Blender now today I
thought I'd try something new I'm using
this curly s1 loose face powder I'm just
kidding I used this all the time because
I'm obsessed with it in so gray
I don't know it's just cheap and it
works it does wonders then I'm just
setting the rest of my face with that
moving on to bronzer today I'm just
using a VG baked bronzer front it's all
about makeup wasn't sure how much it
costs sorry I actually got given this as
a gift
so yeah I'm just bronzing my face up
with that and yeah I'm just gonna bronze
my face I'm not gonna contour yeah I'm
gonna be doing that after my eyes I just
like to move on to different things I
kind of get sick of doing the same thing
so a little dance break yeah Ariana
okay allied I'm kind of contouring my
nose a little bit and then just pinching
the sides in with that now moving on to
your eyes I'm using the morphe 35o
palette this is stunning
they blend out so well and the colors
are incredible so basically what I'm
doing is just taking different colors
that kind of look good next to each
other so like I've done the pink as the
transition then I've gone in with the
purple and then gonna go in with a blue
and then a bit of green and then yellow
then orange than a red so I'm kind of
just wanting them to blend all together
and I am using different brushes for
each color because if you don't then it
gets really messy so try and use
different brushes as you can as much as
you can and yeah these shadows are so
pigmented I swear this isn't sponsored
by morphe I'm just obsessed with this
palette now this is like the first time
I think I've ever used it no second time
I think no thirst I actually don't know
but I'm obsessed with that I love it the
eyeshadows are just as pigmented as
sugarpill if you guys know what sugar
pill is almost as pigmented as them but
sugar pill is probably a little bit more
creamy and a little bit for buttering
and easier to blend it out but this
morphe palette is still easy to blend
out and I love it
you
then I'm just moving on to under the
eyes I'm just taking a little tiny brush
with the orange color from the morphe
palette and then I'll be going in with
the red on the inner corner I didn't
want to do too much red because then it
looks like your eyes are bloodshot so I
just kind of keep it like try to keep a
quite minimal and I think it's pretty
good then I'm just blending that down a
little bit just to make sure it's quite
seamless now moving on to liner I'm
using Geoffrey startzville the word
liquid lipstick English coloured
druglord a lot of people have been
asking this I say yes it is I say it is
100% vegan it is very safe for the eyes
and people even use on their waterline
these days so come on this can't be that
bad so I'm just kind of making a big
wing with that and then I'm going to be
going over with benefits and magic ink
and I'm going to be creating a short
little black wing I'm just doing the
black wing because I feel like it
defines the eye a lot more and you kind
of need it when you're using white line
up
now moving on to mascara I thought I'd
use something a little bit different and
change it up I got sent this in the post
for amore so I thought I might try it
out rather than just using the same
products in every single video that I'm
moving on to lashes these of lashes and
these are in the style GG they are
absolutely stunning I'm obsessed with
their whole range you will see me use
them in every single video until I can
no longer use them anymore that I'm just
going under my eye a little bit more and
defining that color a little bit more
because I felt like we just needed her
for my eye pencil I'm using the
Maybelline pencil I didn't take a
close-up shot of that because I totally
forgot and I poked myself in the eye and
if you do your waterline you know how
much of hurts
moving on to mascara for bottom lashes
I'm using the Mac extended play
gigablack lash mascara this is the best
for bottom lashes right for top 3 but
it's extra good for bottoms then I'm
just wiping off that bake now that the
eyes are done and it's soaked into my
skin now I'm just gonna finish
contouring with the Anastacio Beverly
Hills contour kit my Holy Grail contour
kit there is nothing out there that's
better than this that I know of as of
yet but for now it's my favorite
so yeah just contouring my fat jawline
away we're trying to create a jawline
not get rid of it we're trying to make
one then for blush I'm using NARS
Angelica and just putting quite a bit on
my cheeks I don't really like blush but
I feel like but this look a bit more was
better because it just it looks nice I
really liked it for highlighter I'm
using the mary lou manizer by the balm
and spicing up my entire face because I
want you glow for the gods
now I'm just baking my face back with
the Cody s fun powder this just cleans
up your contour a little bit and makes
it look a little bit better you know you
know for my lips I use colour pop
clueless liquid lipstick I didn't take a
close-up shot of this because I forgot
and my OCD is going off right now but
it'll have to do guys it'll have to do I
just rediscovered this lipstick and I'm
now obsessed with it and I probably
gonna be wearing a lot more often
obsessed then I'm just wiping off that
bake and that is it I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did give me a
thumbs up and I'll see you all in my
next one
love you guys so much bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
