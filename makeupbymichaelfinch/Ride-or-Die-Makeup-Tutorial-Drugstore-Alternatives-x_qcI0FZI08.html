have been tagged by makeup by Jaz to do
the right on time makeup tag and I'll
leave her video link down below so go
check hers out as well
now this tag was apparently created by
Jacqueline Hill as far as I know so
kudos to Jacqueline Hill for this so
basically if you don't know what the
right align makeup tag is it is where
you basically tell people all of your
ride or die maker products you can only
choose one but I'm gonna be doing it a
little bit differently today so I'm
going to be telling you all of my
rattled eyes and I'm going to be telling
you some drugstore droops if I don't
have a do for that product
then I just simply won't say anything
but I want this to be kind of like good
for everybody so if you want to go out
and get some of these products you are
able to go out and get the high-end
products or the drugstore products so
yeah I haven't actually seen anyone do
this but I'm actually going to be
applying the products onto my face as I
talk about them and tell you the
products and I might be using some of
the drugstore products as well okay
let's get straight into it okay so let's
start off with the eyebrows so this is
the first thing I wanted to talk about
and this is the goof proof goof proof
brow pencil so it's got a little spooley
on one side and on the other side it's
got like a little jell thing I don't
know how to explain it so basically what
I like to do is just I just go through
my brows and this just kind of like adds
like a little bit of like a bit of
texture and a bit of color so you can
basically just create a whole new shape
with this product so as you can see I'm
just filling my whole entire brow just
using this product and in my opinion
that looks pretty good
so that was my favorite brow pencil now
for the next thing and this is my
favorite brow sort of I don't know what
it's called like hair dye ralphing oh
this is called gimme brow from benefit
basically all you do is you take the
little one down and just flick it
through your eyebrow hairs and it more
or less tense them and like if you have
any blonde strays hanging around that
you don't want it just covers them up
quite nicely next thing I wanted to talk
about is concealer now I love a good
high strength industrial strong high
coverage concealer and one of my
favorite concealers if I have to choose
one I love
okay I love the Too Faced Born This Way
I love the NARS radiant creamy but if I
had to choose it would definitely be the
Mac Pro Longwear concealer and sits in
the shade nc15 I love this to carve out
my eyebrows underneath and use as an
eyeshadow base
I don't years ago Jacqueline Hill used
to use it as an eyeshadow base adorned
if she still does but ever since then
that's what I've been using and if I had
to choose a concealer that was drugstore
for my ride-or-die makeup tag it would
be the Maybelline fit me concealer any
of the shade 10 light or 15 fair now you
guys knew it was coming my all-time
favorite primer and I don't have a dupe
for this if you guys know I do leave a
comment down below but my all-time
favorite primer is the benefit
Porefessional this is a maxi size of
this I'm almost out I'm so demo
basically what this does is it fills in
all your pores and blurs the whole
surface and it also feels so smooth and
it also feels really really good now in
my opinion this is quite a pricy product
but honestly honestly it's worth it if
you have large pores that you want to
like fill in once you put that
foundation over the top it's just by the
way if you guys wondering why my eyes
look really weird I just scrubbed my
eyes to get all this mascara off and now
they're really bloodshot and weird so
yeah save it in the comments now this
was so hard to do because I have two
foundations that I love but I've only
just recently discovered this I've known
about it for a long time but I've never
tried it this is the Makeup Forever HD
old truck sorry this is the vague upper
ever Ultra HD foundation and this is in
the shade I don't know but it's for when
I'm very very tense so I'm gonna be
using this today and showing you and if
I had to choose a drug saw it's not a
dupe but if I had to choose a foundation
that I really really like to give as
drugstore it would be the Loreal Pro
infallible this stuff is also really
really good and it's very much
so if you have all this skin get up this
foundation basically what I like to do
with this foundation is I just get it
straight on a foundation brush and I
just paint my entire face with it
this foundation is also super duper high
coverage it's very buildable in my
opinion as you can see that kind of
matches my tan or eye makeup work buddy
and it's very like this color is very
orange based I'm just going to say it's
orange base but once you've highlighted
enjoying everything it all comes
together in my opinion then what I do is
I just take my damn Beauty Blender and I
just blend this out to perfection now I
don't know if this is against the rules
or whatever but I'm just going to pop in
another drugstore product that I really
do like this is the LA girl Pro
concealer in the shade porcelain this is
also very very cheap very affordable
it's even cheaper than the maybelline
concealer and you can get this off a
website called lady Moss I'll leave the
link down below because I know people
going to ask me where I get it from
don't buy them off eBay because they're
probably fake and you'll probably burn
your face off so I like to cake the
out of my face in this especially when
I've got such a dark um foundation on I
really need to highlight the areas a lot
then once again I just take my damp
Beauty blender and blend that all out
when I would say the coverage of this is
super good in my opinion but I always
put too much on my nose so my nose
highlight goes halfway down my
face now I thought I'd never say this in
a million years I let my s fine powder
bike Rudi down but I have found my true
Holy Grail muddled by baking the
translucent powder this is the RTM a no
color powder I've used this on a lot of
tutorials and a lot more tutorials to
come this is a great product to bake
with under your eyes apparently it
leaves a bit of a white cast which I can
knock that back with banana powder and
just wipe off that product perfectly so
there is no you know flashback or white
cast under there but it gives you a
really nice strong highlight underneath
your eyes basically what I do is I just
pack it on underneath my eyes as so a
very very generous amount and just down
into like a triangle shape here now my
all-time favorite foundation powder guys
you know is coming this is the Australis
fresh and flawless pressed powder in the
shade medium 10 I use this in a lot of
different shades depends if I'm tan or
if I'm not tan and I also like to use
one of my clients as well and if I have
to choose a high-end powder that was my
favorite it would be the NAS pressed
powder and this is in the shade Beach is
quite a yellow tone I only use this when
I am pale so I just like to take the
fresh and flawless powder on a big
fluffy brush and just Pat it all into my
skin
now this foundation powder is super high
coverage people say that it's a dupe for
the Mac Studio Fix powder foundation
and I think it's just as good I tried it
years and years ago the studio thinks
foundation powder stuff and I think it's
just as good to be honest so this is
around 15 dollars Australian you can get
it in Priceline cameras warehouse all
those sorts of places and honestly it's
just the best thing that's ever happened
to me like it mattifies it sets it's got
full coverage and it's extremely cheap
my all-time favorite bronzer would have
to be max give me Sun this is stunning
it is perfectly when you are 10 if
you're more on the pale side I wouldn't
recommend it because I might come up a
little bit Orange on you as it does on
me I don't actually have a dupe for this
product or a drugstore bronzer that I
really like good enough to put in this
video so we'll just stick with the map
give me Sun so I just like to take this
on a big fluffy brush and just run it
all over my face on the areas where I'm
going to contour I'm not actually
contouring with it but I'm just running
all over the areas of my face where I
will be contouring afterwards because
the more powder you put down the better
it's going to blend now my all-time
favorite contour some people might think
it's overrated personally I don't think
it is I love this for many many years
and many more years to come this is the
UH Nastasia Beverly Hills contour kit in
the shade light I love this so much as
you can see this shade here and the
shade here I clearly my favorite I've
just started using to shake here in the
shade here so I'm yet to play with them
a little bit more generally what I do is
I just mix these two shades here
together and then I just come to Iowa my
face these blends so nicely and they're
not muddy in any way they also I think
they come in three different shades
light/medium and dark so for all
different skin tones which is perfect
okay guys time for my favorite blush now
I have two to show you because one is
that drugstore one is high-end I think I
don't know I think it's considered
high-end my high-end one is a makeup
geeks blush in the shade romance this is
a beautiful peachy glowy and it's got a
bit of Sheen to it which I love on the
cheek area and then on the drugstore
side we have Milani baked blush in the
shade and Luminoso this is all so
 beautiful it's one of Jacqueline
Hill's favorites just got to say that
because everything Jacqueline Hill gets
I get and to be honest they're both
pretty similar I think this one's just a
little bit later and
both have Sheen to them as well so I
think that's what I lack in a blush
I like washes that aren't too pink and
more on the pinky-orange II iridescent
tees for the side times my favorite
highlighter now these guys this was so
hard to choose because I'm trying so
many new hot ladders at the moment but I
thought I just stick to my guns and you
know you show you guys the one that I
always go back to you regardless of what
the situation is this is a champagne pot
from back art this is the Jacqueline
Hill collaboration this has gone
literally worldwide when this first came
out everyone went crazy I didn't get it
for a long time until after it came out
cuz I still spoke when I saw one of
those overrated things but now it's
actually so good it's got like a
champagne color to it and then a
drugstore one that I also love and I've
had this for so many years this is the
mary lou manizer from the balm you might
be thinking this isn't drugstore
I'm they sell it in Target now so
technically in Australia its drugstore
so again I used to sell it in David
Jones I don't think I do anymore I think
it's come down to the you know the tiger
level I don't know if that's a good or a
bad thing but low life so I'm just
dipping into champagne ball and just
popping that on my cheeks now this was
so hard to do and I'm tossing up between
my makeup geek Z palette or this but I
just thought I would choose this because
it's an eyeshadow palette not like one
that I made myself this is the Anastasia
Beverly Hills and Modern Renaissance
palette this is me in a palette
this is a gorgeous this has like oranges
paint you got your warm turns great
transitions you got your highlights you
got your island colors you've got
everything it is just stunning it is
thrown actually got a red one here it's
so pretty now my most favorite eyeliner
that I've ever used is the Maybelline of
studio gel liner in the shade blackest
black this takes a little while to dry
so it's great to smudge down on your
lower lash line or if you're doing a
smoky wing or anything like that now
it's time to choose my favorite mascara
I have chosen a Too Faced better than
sex mascara this stuff is so volumizing
so good doesn't make your lashes clumpy
and it's super super black now if I had
to choose a drugstore one it would be
the L'Oreal carbon black mascara
this isn't available to buy in Australia
you can only get this one like eBay and
like other sites like that because it is
like an exclusively American thing but I
know a lot of the Kardashians makeup
artists use this follow of celebrity
makeup artist
is this an jacqueline hill okay guys now
it's time for my favorite but not a
powder now if you've been watching my
tutorials for a while you would know
that I love dough fried banana powder I
don't know what it is about this banana
powder but it's just so pigmented like
it doesn't look it in person but like
when it goes on the skin it just
brightens up everything completely and
it looks amazing
normally I do this before my highlight
but I just didn't for the sake of the
video um and it just looks so nice and I
love to pack it on now it's so hard to
choose eyelashes but if I had to I would
either choose Lilly ghalichi lashes in
the style Miami or Sofia a Sapporo and
these are in the style Sofia I use these
on a lot of my tutorials I get sent a
lot of lashes from like instagram
companies or instagram companies but
like a lot of lash brands on instagram
contact me and what does that mean
lashes so I get strata backlight of
lashes another one is also billion
lashes but it's just sort of hard to
choose but if I had to it would
definitely be Lilly ghalichi lashes 100%
why are on the topic of lashes I'll just
like to say my favourite lash glue ever
is house of lashes black lash glue they
also have a clear glue too but I'm not
too sure where it is actually it's
repaired here this is what the clear one
looks like they are so great they don't
rip your lashes out the staying power is
so strong and they are also latex-free
so that means that it dries quite fast I
don't have to wait but they're insisting
up and it's just so convenient
especially when you're in a rush I think
this was literally the hardest part of
this video was to choose my favorite
liquid lipstick brand this is a dose of
colors this is in the color stone their
formula is the most non drying non
cracking most moisturizing it doesn't
transfer you can eat ten dinner boxes
and nothing will be off your lips it is
literally amazing it is my all-time
favorite this was so hard to choose
because I've got like four other brands
and I'm obsessed with but if I had to
choose it would definitely be this one
now let's talk about my favorite lip
liner these are the only two that I've
ever tried from Kylie cosmetics this is
candy cane job shaky
I feel like this formula is so so smooth
and it dries on the lips nicely as well
like it doesn't I feel like it doesn't
move
as much as some other lip liners this
compared to Mac is amazing because of
Mac's ones are so dry so if you like a
really dry lip liner but still pigmented
and kind of easy to work with and
definitely Mac is for you but these are
just so smooth and pretty I'm not going
to put on today because I like this lip
color that I've got now now my all-time
favorite lip gloss would have to be
color pop they have so many nice
clusters they're so stunning
they're not too sticky they're not too
intense and I love them this is in the
shade I don't know it's like a I haven't
actually used this one yet but it's like
a gleam II kind of like iridescent shade
but I've got a lot of color pop glosses
and they're all what my favorite I love
them all dearly and the formula is just
great
now you guys knew it was coming my
favorite hydration spray is definitely
the mac fix+ i just use this like after
I've done my makeup to make it a bit
more Joey or before doing my highlights
on my face is where my holo shows up a
little bit better I just give my face a
few squirts of it or a lot I've gone
through so many bottles of this and
seriously I need to get more because is
it literally my favorite thing ever
and last but not least my all-time
favorite setting spray is the Urban
Decay all nighter setting spray I use
this on me my friends or my clients I go
through this like a a McDonald's it's
ridiculous but I love it so much it's
hands-down one of the best so that is
the end of my ride-or-die makeup tag I
hope you guys really enjoyed this video
if I forgotten anything I'm literally
going to cry what I'm editing this I
don't think I have a pretty sure I've
covered all bases all the products that
I mentioned today will be listed down
below next to the drugstore products if
I did mention them and if you're a
youtuber and you just finished watching
this in your at this point I've had you
to do this makeup tag because I think
it's kind of fun in the way that I've
done it is kind of different from
everybody else I haven't seen anyone do
this but if they have I'm sorry I didn't
invent it
but I mean I just kind of thought of to
do this so yeah anyway guys I love you
all so much thank you so much for almost
80,000 subscribers we are getting so
close that means the world to me I love
you guys so much and I'll see you all in
my next video bye
