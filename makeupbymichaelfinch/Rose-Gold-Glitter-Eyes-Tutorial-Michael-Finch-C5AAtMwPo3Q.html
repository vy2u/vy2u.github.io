let's just get straight into the
tutorial so first of all I'm just taking
a primer to assure that this makeup
stays on all throughout the day by the
way all products used in today's video
will be listed down below and/or on the
screen right now then I'm just taking a
concealer and applying that to my eyes
so it's quite a high coverage concealer
this is the NARS radiant creamy
concealer I just believe this is a
better base for your eyeshadow than an
actual eye base now I'm just going to be
setting that with my nas powder in Beach
just so my shadows don't stick too well
but I don't want to bake my eyelids
otherwise eyeshadows weren't show up as
well now using my favorite palette ever
this is my mani MUA palette it is bloody
incredible I'm obsessed with it
first of all I'm just applying a
transition shade now you're not really
going to see this at all because it's
going to be covered but it's just nice
to have that bit of powder extra powder
down just so the colors do blend out you
know quite a little bit easier then I'm
going in with the pinky ready shade and
I'm literally just blending and blending
and blending adding more blending
blending adding more
so I'm literally just adding so much
color to my entire this whole look is
about this color eyeshadow like I wanted
to be about this now I'm just defining
that a little bit more with the darker
color in the money palette not sure the
names are I'm very sorry I'll leave them
on the screen but it's all part of the
one palette and yeah basically just
defining the outer corner a little bit
and just adding that little bit of
definition in there just to like spice
it up that extra little bit now taking
my Too Faced glitter glue I'm just going
to be applying a small small amount to
my eyes now you need the tiniest tiniest
tiniest amount of this little goes a
long way and try not to get it all over
your lashes like I did because well I'm
a idiot then I'm using a violet
Voss glitter this is in the shade
Rosalinda I'll leave it down below and
on the screen I'm sorry I'm the sorry
I'm sorry I didn't show it right now I
just simply forgot but yeah basically
I'm just popping that all over my
eyelids and look at the color incredible
then I'm using my Maybelline gel liner
and just doing a huge well semi huge
wing with my little tiny zueva liner
brush this brush is amazing and this
liner is also incredible so controllable
and so easy to work with now I'm kind of
spring that liner down into my inner
corner and just creating a little line
you'll see why afterwards so now I'm
just doing my foundation now that the
tops of my eyes are done and I'm using
the Chi Chi Foundation I'm pretty sure
it was I'll leave it on the screen or
down below as I said before all products
will be listed everywhere I swear to God
I promise they'll all be there so I was
talking to Alex that's why I was rolling
my eyes at our typical but yeah I'm just
using a Beauty Blender and blending that
all over my face and I'm using quite a
lot of it just because I look like
really full coverage this foundation is
quite full coverage as you can see but
I'm just adding heaps and heaps and
heaps of it
now just taking my NARS concealer again
I'm just highlighting the areas on my
face under my eyes on my nose my Cupid's
bow my chin and also my big forehead and
then just taking my Beauty Blender this
is a damp Beauty Blender by the way
always use your Beauty Blender damn if
you didn't know that just a little tip
I'm assuming a lot of you know that some
of you may not there you go I also
spritz it with just a little bit of fix+
just to like moisture up a sponge a
little bit and I feel like it blends it
that little bit of better that I'm just
as usual baking with micro ts1 powder
under my eyes the sides of my nose just
to avoid fallout when I do underneath my
eyes and try not to choke on it like I
always do then I'm just sitting the rest
of my face with my NARS
powder in beach and wiping off after
bake so that was kind of pointless I
mean anyway
yes I'm just dusting that all over my
face and I'm moving on to my brows and
I'm using the it cosmetics brow pencil
bare with me with my brows if you guys
want to see a full tutorial on my brows
just let me know I'm changing them up at
the moment I'm kind of hating doing my
brows Lee's been my favorite thing now
I've just kind of been turned off doing
them and I absolutely hate it but that's
a whole new video now taking the
Maybelline gel liner that I used for my
wing I'm just applying that in my
waterline and underneath so as you can
see in a second I'll be dragging it down
because I am going to be smoking this
right out seeing as I'm just bringing
that down a bit extra like through the
lash line band thing or whatever it's
called and just bringing that down
because I will be smoking that out and
also this liner is great for smudging
stuff down it doesn't dry instantly and
it doesn't leave a crisp line so it
stays wet for a while and it's really
good to smoke out
then I'm just dusting off that bake
because that is no longer needed anymore
and then I'm just applying some true
face lip injection extreme onto my lips
just to prep them mascara today I use
the Too Faced better than sex my new
favorite mascara I'm obsessed with it
it's just so good if you haven't tried
it try it lashes today are billion
lashes in Kendall I will leave the link
down below and on the screen right now
for those they're just incredible
they're fully fluffy minke they kinda
remind me of the Lilly ghalichi ones
just not as fluffy but still just as
good then I'm contouring my nose if you
guys want to see a full in-depth
tutorial how I do contour my nose
because it is quite dramatic I'm really
happy to do that just give this video a
thumbs up so I know that you guys want
to see it and leave a comment down below
then I'm also going in with my Anastasia
Beverly Hills contour kit no I lied
sorry this is either Mac give me Sun or
it's all about makeup fiji bronzer i'll
leave it on the screen now actually it's
the all about makeup bronzer I don't
really use give me some what I'm pale
because it is quite orange and this
bronzer just turns it down a little bit
so now I'm going with my honest I see I
Beverly Hills contour kit and just
contouring my entire face because
clearly I need it flat face bath then I
decided to go in with just a little bit
of the yellow shade from my own stash
your kit and highlight my nose for my
blush today I'm using it cosmetics I
forget what it's called but I leave it
on the screen now sorry for being a
 in today's video I'm pretty
pathetic with this whole tutorial but I
did my best I mean yeah then I'm just
going in with that red shade again and
just smoking out that lash line a tiny
bit more for my lips today it's candy
cave by Kylie cosmetics this is my
friend Alex's it's not mine I don't know
it probably never will it's not my
favorite look at the liquid lipstick in
the world but that's a whole new media
then for my highlight today is Becca
champagne pop which I'm obsessed with
and just applying that cobble
then I decided to come in a little bit
more glitter just under my eyes just to
make it pop a little bit more severely
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this
tutorial that is the end of today's one
hope you enjoyed and I will see you all
in my next video I'm bang</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
