huh Sonali alert I don't I don't know
what to say
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm going to be doing a stripped
down charge now if you don't like this
is if you don't know what this is see
normally I would cut that out and refill
that part when I stutter but no not
today
so better so basically the strip down
challenge is where you're not meant to
wear makeup but I am anyway other people
have done it so he cares and you're just
meant to talk about yourself for like 10
minutes nor anything no cuts no music
nothing like that sorry mmm
don't know what I'm going to talk about
so okay so basically for those who are
new here or if you don't know me noted
my name is Michael Finch and I just
turned 20 so I'm nearly 20 years old 21
next year my birthday's on 8th of
September and I am a Virgo oh um I don't
know what to talk about I don't know
what to do you're judging me guys a
little bit so a little bit I love these
autofocus cameras are so good for those
asking when I film with because I know a
lot of people ask this and I really I
really remember to ever answer this I
feel mood to umbrella lights a massive a
ring light and then I've got my tripod
in my camera smack them in the middle of
the ring light so I like brightens up my
face I can't believe I used to film
YouTube videos with Apple ring light
don't know how I survived that anyway so
what should we talk about bindi bindi
cubby
oh now for those who don't know who
bindi as Benny is my friend Chinese dog
and I'm literally obsessed I would take
a bullet for bindi hashtag bullet for
bindi get a trending trending on Twitter
and getting Jo but you see like I'm
trying to be funny but it's just not
working today do you know what I mean so
yeah basically I'm obsessed with bindi
Luna I'm obsessed with like just dogs in
general but bendy is such like a human
lack person like she's got a dog bendy
is a human she sits at the dinner table
she just talks to us like she just like
has casual chats
um she gets all up in my face um yeah
really no no we're talked about
I've covered the most important thing
there is me and Mindy um let's take a
little bit of fix+ and just spritz this
on the face now some people think this
is a setting spray but it's actually not
just a hydration mist I don't think it
can be used as a setting spray because
it's literally just water in a bottle I
don't know but I'm gonna spray a little
bit like you know I just want so
refreshing like honestly I'll even wear
that when I don't have makeup on I just
like spritz on my face and be like bye
um so yeah what can we talk about let's
talk about youtubers let's talk about
some youtube drama
just because we can I had to be so
careful what I say because I'm not
refilling this Apple otherwise I feel
like it won't be as genuine as I wanted
to come across um
youtuber drama let's talk about people
who have a stalk when someone else does
a similar video to them and has a
massive like whinge about it hmm
I mean I don't want to get into it too
much because I don't want to give away
too many details but I'm there's been a
few situations lately this has made me
think what the hell like grow the
up like people just are just absolute
sucks and honestly people copying or
getting ideas from other people is what
makes the world go round so if you're
going to sit there and have a stalk
about if someone's inspired by your
video then go ahead and do that but you
just look like a idiot because
of youtube and at the end of the day
everyone copies everyone and that's how
youtubers get everywhere so
we're um so yeah not mentioning any
names just throwing a little bit of
shade that's because that's what I'm
good at doing I try to avoid that whole
how do you tube no I used to love
throwing shade and like making I made
this video that was like youtubers I
hate but I'd ever even spoke about it
because it was clickbait um yeah I'm
admitting to that because I'm so real
but like I didn't know the clickbait was
such like I hated on the scene back then
when I made the video so um yeah
clickbait is like mm-hmm I mean
sometimes it's funny but sometimes it's
not I didn't want to have with my friend
Alex we filmed it what's in my mouth
challenge video and I got how to stick a
dildo like holding it against my mouth
and everyone was like clickbait
clickbank because we never even like
used a dildo in the video I'll show you
the deal the dildo in the video use the
dildo in the video yeah YouTube's gonna
accept that might as well not with these
new rules what they've got going on I
don't know why people here way I'm just
like what do I talk about what were they
up to five minutes me up yours our
key door key Mindy cubby knew so
whatever I'm doing for Museum I really
wanna go to Brisbane for me is e because
I haven't been to a city ever for these
even I've got friends up there and it
would just be cool either Brisbane
Melbourne or Sydney I don't know just
whatever happens but I'm having any it's
a client request to do makeup I'm not
going to be doing client makeup as much
anymore and oh my god I have not told
really anyone that's I've been talking
with a few friends about it and my
family obviously about next year I hope
to move to Brisbane in a cute little
apartment high-rise somewhere I don't
know where but I just really want to
I've seen to get out of this town and a
lot of people being saying to me for
such a long time how are you surviving
here what are you doing here like you
need to get out of here need to get to
the city and honestly when I was younger
I was like Melbourne is the place that I
want to move like Melbourne is where I
want to go but ever since been to the
Gold Coast and been to Brisbane it's so
much more like chilled out and more
slower and everything's just so much
relax there and I feel like Malbin is
always gar gar gar like if you live in
Brisbane and you've been to Melbourne G
think the same thing or if you live in
Melbourne you've been to Brisbane do you
think the same thing as me because
honestly I feel like it's just so much
more like everything gives me anxiety in
Melbourne like there's just so many
people and everything but I feel like in
the Gold Coast and Brisbane it's so much
it's so much more chilled out and just
like I don't want to say cleaner because
that's calling valve Antonia Melvin's
not dirty sometimes available than a
dirty but um yeah definitely um I hope
to move to brisbane next year i got my
angel cards read by Elinor's mum the
other day and I answered a question
about that and she said it said
something to do with moving after May
which makes sense because I've got a
 ton of weddings booked for next
year from like January or February to
March and then a few in April and then
May it's pretty much clear on our from
down there so I feel like it's meant to
be um but I really just want to live in
my own little apartment I want to have
two bedrooms and I want to have my
bedroom and that I want to have one for
like my filming rooms when I have a
fully dedicated room for my filming room
because where I'm living now in my house
because I still live with my parents in
case you didn't know that I'm still I'd
done nearly just 20 so I know a lot of
people move up in the 18 but whatever
you know my uncle told me one day he
goes oh no my uncle's wife said I know
this is kind of rude to say I think he
said oh and I just kind of like mean to
say but use your parents as much as you
can before you move out because you will
save a lot of money and you'll benefit
from that which is kind of true I guess
but I don't know maybe he just worried
or wrong I don't know I don't want
people to take that the wrong way
cuz I love living with my mum my dad on
the other hand and need to be quiet
because he's out there and I don't want
to hear so um yeah that's a whole new
 video so yeah I hope to
move to Brisbane and it's gonna be so so
good I said I've already said to Shani
I'm like bees coming over for sleepovers
sometimes she's going to move in with me
for a week Luna's coming over for
slipper sleepovers everyone's coming
over for sleepovers one's going to be
 large I want to live like in the
valley or just out of the valley or
something or like a really nice suburb
that's really close because I don't want
to have a car up there like I don't want
to drive I hate driving gives me anxiety
plus ubers there we don't have that
River where I live now because we're in
a small country town but yeah Uber's up
there and I just I'm literally obsessed
with every but a hashtag not one third
but rubriz bought out is and you think
that's like Ruby eats last time I was in
Brisbane it was like Ruby eats and I'm
like what is this sorcery wank
and I clicked on it and how you can
order fruit and they bring you food to
your door I didn't do it because I ended
up going to like Max Brenner or
Manhattan line or something to get like
an American cheesy burger oh yeah that's
what I did then I'm Gary breeds I'm down
for that hashtag that's one for that
sweater gone it's just cool that like
people can bring but one thing I don't
deliver is McDonald's I'm like what's
the point of having group rates
if you don't deliver McDonald's or KFC
anyway bat sing louder to that idea um
so yeah what are we up to 9 minutes 30
Rome s at the 10-minute mark
