video so in today's video I'm going to
be speaking about the time that I got
arrested and yes you probably like what
the fuck did he do let me get into it so
back in the day when I was probably 14
or 15 years old I had a different group
of friends and we were all kind of like
really naughty people so just remember
that I was like 14 or 15 years old I
don't remember when but I know I was
under 15 or just 15 so I got dared to go
into a local supermarket and this is
like not in the town that I live in this
is in a different town and steal a
chocolate bar and a packet of gum and I
was like you know 14-year old mine I'm
like fuck you I'm gonna do it like I'm
such a fucking rebel no I was like
freaking out but like if I didn't do it
then I wouldn't be cool so I kind of got
peer pressured into it in a way so
basically what happened was I went into
this supermarket and I got a chocolate
bar and I put it in my pocket and I'm
gonna pack it a gun and I put in my
other pocket and then I was walking
around the aisles for a few you know
minutes because I didn't want to look
too sauce or whatever so I picked up
other like a few other things that I was
going to purchase after being in the
supermarket for about 10 minutes I
thought look I'm all good and you know
I'm not gonna get in trouble for this
like no one saw me like no stuff saw me
was I wrong so I went through the
register I got like a bottle of soda or
something else in a bottle of water I
think anyway I went through I was really
nice to the cash register person and now
thinking back about it she totally knew
what I was up to so I pay for my shit
anyway I walked across like I was still
in the plaza or whatever and I walked
out of the thing and across and I was
facing that way and then suddenly I hear
these people running up behind me and I
turn around and there's this chick that
was a customer in the supermarket pulls
out her ID thing I was like blah blah
blah blah blah I'm gonna have to ask you
to come with me and my heart just drops
like I was like and I was like fuck I
literally did not know what to do so I
was just like yeah sure and I followed
her then through other staff members so
this woman that approached me outside
the shop because apparently they can't
get you for stealing until you leave the
actual place like you're out of the
perimeter like you've left she was
waiting for that obviously and came up
behind me and was like right come with
me and I'm like ah SH shitty ass dick to
other staff members came with her and
they walked me through the shopping
center kept walking me through and I had
to go up these stairs and I had him in
my pocket so I'm like what happens if I
just like take him out and like drop him
right now but they were like literally
there was like two people here and there
was one person here there was no chance
of me getting out of this at all so I
had to walk up these stairs I got taken
into this room and I walked into this
room right and there was this massive
fucking table like I'm talking of a huge
table like 20 people could sit around at
like you know Devil Wears Prada you know
when they're in that room having a
meeting literally that big and there is
like food clothes makeup chopsticks bras
underwear meat chocolate everything
anyway I'm sitting on my colleague fuck
like what is this so the manager comes
up to me and he kind of yells at me like
he's kind of yelling at me and I'm kind
of doing that like Oh SOS like can I
call my mom and they're like no we're
gonna have to call the police because
you stole it and you're gonna need to be
taken to the police station oh my god
car you just like let me off like I've
never done this before and they're like
no we'll have to call the police and I'm
like ah rude just keep in mind that this
was many many years ago and I've never
done it since and I never will I have
hard core learned my lesson so it was
like 20 minutes for the police to arrive
they pretty much just like escorted me
out through the front of the shopping
center so I had to walk through with
these police people and I got put in the
back of like a paddy wagon or something
like that the police you know those
little vans where you got put in the
back but putting one of those and I'm
like eventually stole a chocolate bar
and like chewing gum and I was like
sitting in the back of the van and I was
like bawling my eyes out and it was like
cameras in there I was like covering
them with my hands and I'm just like
don't fucking look at me cry like roots
or then I got taken to the police
station this was the most fucked
I literally felt like amanda bynes three
years ago oh my god they literally took
mug shots on me they printed off my name
and I had to hold this bit of paper and
it said a michael Finch on it because it
was so long ago this is when I had like
long blonde hair it was like kind of
like like that emo sort of style he
asked me to move my head my fringe off
my eye and I'm like you're kidding right
you know how much like I didn't say that
I'm making sure but literally there was
so much hairspray in my hair when I
moved my fringe back my whole fucking
head of hair literally went up like this
so not just one bit like not just the
fringe the whole thing went back like it
was like stuck up like this anyways I
look in the mug shots and my damn I look
good and I'm kidding I literally that
was stronger I didn't know what makeup
was I had no eyebrows like I was
disgusting and it was just disgusting
and it was just gross and they gave me a
warning because if you're under 16 it
doesn't go on your record when you turn
18 so it disappears when you turn 16
acting sorry I don't know the laws are
probably changed now but it's what we
saw on my record I've got nothing bad on
my record I will never ever do it again
like even just thinking about it like 6
or 7 years later or whatever I still
stress me out to the point why I did it
and then what makes it even worse is I
get home ok and I didn't have a phone
back then or whatever so I get home and
I check Facebook and I just come back
from a friend's party and this is my old
old old best friend I'm slowing on my
friends with anymore she's such a
fucking bitch I get home and I look on
Facebook and my friend had written all
over Facebook oh my god what a stealer I
wonder what he took from my house like
all this stuff and I'm just like whoa
like hold up I literally didn't take
anything from your house calm the fuck
down you stupid idiot so we just got
into a fight about that and then she was
like I wonder what you stole from me and
I'm like ah bitch you probably try and
steal from fucking McDonald's you
probably try and take like the fuckin
sugars and the salts and the straws and
the napkins just a feature fuckin family
like oh sorry annoying must I add this
chicken roll all over Facebook is a
complete bargain and if you're watching
how
so yeah the reason why I made this video
is because I just want to warn people do
not steal number one if you do you will
probably get caught because they are
very very strict nowadays there are
mists there are a lot of mystery
shoppers around even if you're in a
small town there are mystery shoppers
everywhere do not steal because you will
get caught and you will regret it and
especially if you are over 18 you'll
probably go to jail for like 24 hours
I'm not sure what the rules are with
that or like the law or whatever but
it's probably really bad now and just
don't do it and also another thing don't
get peer pressure into doing anything
that you don't want to do I didn't want
to do what I did but my friends peer
pressured me into it because I wanted to
be cool which is so fucking dumb like
it's so dumb anyway I hope you guys have
learned something from this video and

thumbs up subscribe if you haven't
