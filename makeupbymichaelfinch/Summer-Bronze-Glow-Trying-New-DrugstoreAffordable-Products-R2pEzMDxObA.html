channel so today I'm going to be doing a
spring inspired makeup look so not too
much on the eyes just something natural
it's obviously going to be full coverage
and it's obviously gonna have lashes
because I can't do a look without any of
those things I don't really believe in
the things such as light makeup because
it just doesn't work with me it just
doesn't look good I just don't like it I
just don't like it okay so now I want
this a makeup look to also be like quite
affordable and that kind of drug story
so I do have a lot of well not a lot but
I've got a few new drugstore products so
don't try out because price I did have a
40% a whole box longsword and I end up
spending like 160 dollars which is
really really good because I say so much
money so I got a lot of the stuff that
you guys are recommended to me aka drew
for the professional is that maybelline
baby skin instant pore eraser so yeah
stuff like that so the first thing I
want to go in with is the Maybelline a
baby skin instant pore eraser primer
because everyone recommended this to me
that it's a dupe for the pore fessional
so I'm gonna get as like probably like
that much which is probably a lot in
some people's eyes but but it's very
silly crating it just feels like I'm
putting pure silicone on my face I can
understand how people would think this
is a do because it does blur the skin
but you know when you put put that
professional on a tableaus the skin
that's what it's doing now for my eye
base today the concealer I'm using is
the master concealed by Maybelline once
again this is in the shade light so I'm
just gonna put that on my eyelids
because that was probably a lot
 so I'm just gonna be
blending that in with my brush and this
concealer is very I think it's pretty
good I wait and watch on the side and
take some off the light for that so just
blending that in with my Beauty Blender
and now it's gonna be setting that with
some how does just the Australia's fresh
and flawless just so it doesn't crease
you know now for my eyes today I'm gonna
be using this Mallory cosmetics treasure
chest treasure chest
palettes now I never said this was going
to be all drugstore products it's going
to be an affordable since this
thing 2020 $3 USD pricing but so that's
really cheap for an eyeshadow palette in
my opinion seeing as they're paying like
$90 and stuff for eyeshadow palettes so
I'm just going to take this shade here
called pearl and I'm just going to run
that through that outer crease I'm
really excited to do a spring makeup
look because everything I do is so like
full glam and just full-on and I just
want like a little bit of
something-something through the crease
and just starting on the linen just like
shimmering it like sparkly and then it's
going to be taking some of the shape
called tiger eye here just very lightly
blending on my outer crease of V not too
much products I'm just going to take a
little bit of shade here called bolt the
Heisei box I don't know Punk
alright NYX not good at saying stuff and
I'm just going to put a little bit of
that just into the outer part of my eye
so you have a little bit of definition
on that outer the area nothing too much
at all I'm steering away from like your
much dramatic stuff now taking the shade
here called smoked topaz I'm just going
to get a little bit on my brush but I'm
just going to spray a little bit of fix+
on that just so we get super good
pigmentation I'm also just taking some
of the shade called
amber here and I'm just going to be
putting it on my outer V okay so now
moving back onto the face let's do
foundation and today I'm going to be
using the NYX HD foundation HD
foundation this is in the shade natural
beige because I'm tan gonna be matching
it to my tan obviously so to blend this
and I'm just going to take my g36 brush
first impressions this has full coverage
almost full coverage I feel like it's
buildable so this foundation is really
really nice already the coverage is
really good it's like blending
seamlessly it's not going patchy like I
expected it to good coverage like as you
can tell the coverage is really really
good now once again I'm a concealer I'm
going to be using the Maybelline conceal
so I'm just going to be taking that
under my eyes because my foundation is
so dark I'm gonna need to now to blend
that out I'm just taking my damp Beauty
Blender okay I'm not gonna lie this is
not a damp Beauty Blender distance is a
this is a Beauty Blender that's been
sprayed with some fixed glass because
I'm too lazy to get up my fat ass so I
don't know if you guys can tell but this
concealer is actually high-end level
like it's covered so well it's so
brightening now just to bag my under
eyes today I'm just me going back into
my 30s button powder this is definitely
affordable in my opinion so just baking
a little bit under my eyes and what's
really gonna bake my nose my chin and my
forehead as well now just to set the
rest of my face I'm gonna be using the
Australis crushing flawless pressed
powder in the shade medium tan because
this is a powder that myself and a lot
of other youtubers and a lot of my
friends swear by it just set it just
does the job it gives you the coverage
just now let's finish off underneath the
eyes I'm just going to zoom you guys in
a little bit more so just going back
into the shade called unk's
I don't have a say it on so
we're gonna get judged so hard - that
should not be putting a little bit of
that under my lower lash line cuz then
I'm just going to blend that it are now
going back into the shade smoke topaz
which is the one I've put all over my
eyelid I'm just going to be putting that
straight under my lash line and now for
my inner corner I'm just gonna take a
little bit of the shade called crystal
and I'm just putting that on the inner
corners okay guys moving on to mascara
this is the L'Oreal telescopic mascara
um
I've never tried this before but heard
really good things about it the wand is
so weird I can actually see why people
like it so much because it is actually
super good I'm also just putting that on
my bottom eyelashes as well sticking
them up really well honey is this
mascara often okay so moving on to
bronzer now I couldn't at least find a
bronzer that was affordable drugstore so
I'm just going to be using this Oh fry
americano runs up because this is
probably one of the best ones in over
the years so I'm just going to taking
some of that bronzer on this massive a
fluffy brush here and I'm just going to
be putting it onto my cheeks and around
my jawline area and also around my
forehead just to warm that area up a
little bit now because this is a spring
makeup look I'm not really going to be
contouring today stone bronze up is my
clown Chula I don't know if that's like
what you meant to do but I'm doing it
anyway so for my highlighter today I'm
going to be using this sleek highlighter
palette and I'm going to be going into a
mixture of maybe this one and this one I
was going to spritz my brush with a
little bit of fix+ and just putting that
on the high points oh that's pretty good
I'm just going to be focusing that on
the high points of my face
what I'm also going to do is just take
some of that highlighter and just put it
underneath my brow bone I'm a big fan of
that look at the river
sorry for my blush today I'm just going
to keep it nice and neutral this isn't
makeup geeks romance and I'm just gonna
be putting a little bit of that on my
cheeks and kind of just blending it back
up for my lashes I'm just going to be
using the model rock to five-nines now
these are very very affordable so these
are perfect for this tutorial okay so we
currently have a one lash on and with
these lashes when you put a scar over
them it blends and they look so much
longer and better so imma do that after
alright so as I said before I'm just
gonna go over my fake lashes with a
little bit more telescopic by L'Oreal
because this really does it looks like
your real lashes these eyelashes are
just they just blend sorry Wow like that
honestly looks so good in my opinion
these are the lashes that I use on my
clients
as I did some makeup a few weeks to go
for wedding with my friend Alex and this
is what she was using on them I was like
what I and they are honestly sorry I'm
like huffing and puffing because I just
ran out to get mail to like see what I
got and I have a package from lash and
I'm really excited but I'm like holding
off to open it until after I finished
showing this ah
so I'm fit okay guys - my lip color
today I'm going to be using this matte
liquid lip cream by Milani in the shade
chromatic addicts honestly this car is
so pretty and it smells identical to the
Kylie Jenner lip kits identical well
this is a very random color and I can't
have done anything like this before so
just at my face I would be using the
Loreal fixing mist but it sets all at
the bottom and the chicken pox answer to
shake it up which I did
so I've shook it up to ages and I use
the last night white dots EV Lac looking
better like someone have thrown baby
powder all over my face like they might
be using that again look forward to
seeing that inner products I hate the
video one day okay so instead I'm going
to be using the Maybelline master fix
we're boosting setting spray yeah so I'm
just going to set my entire face mmm
that one doesn't smell the best a kind
of smells like a you know after you've
had an operation and it's like really
like antiseptic that's what it smells
like kind of moldy at the same time and
it my phone go on honestly it's
been flopping around the whole room all
morning all those anyway just brings us
