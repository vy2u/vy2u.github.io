hello guys and welcome back to my
channel so today I'm gonna be doing a
full face of first impressions I've got
a lot of makeup that I can do first
impressions with so I've gathered a
little bit together of stuff that I
bought in America it's pretty much it's
all high-end stuff so there's not really
any drugstore affordable things in here
it's all high-end so I've been sent in
PR and I'm really excited because I love
a good first impression it's what counts
the most
by the way I just got my hair done a few
hours ago so it's looking nice and like
soft and fluffy so I don't really don't
put too much product in it cuz I just
had it washed and everything so I'm just
gonna leave it as is and let's get into
the video okay guys so I've already done
my brows as per usual because I don't
have the first impressions for them at
the mo mousse so I wouldn't go straight
into concealer for my concealer today
I'm gonna be trying out the Dior skin
forever undercover concealer this is in
the shade zero ten I bought this in
Sephora when I was in America and I was
talking to the girl there about it Kiki
I remember your name um I was talking to
her about it and she said it's really
full-coverage so I love a good full
coverage concealer you know
okay now that you nice up and close you
can see all my pores and whatnot I'm
just gonna take this concealer and I'm
just gonna go under my brow because I
might conceal this brow first before we
go any further with anything okay so
it's not as good of coverage as I
expected it to be like just going a
little bit like streaky and whatnot when
I was concealing my brows but that could
all change when I use a Beauty Blender
so I'm just gonna pop this concealer
over the rest of my lids I'm now it's
gonna take my damp Beauty Blender and
I'm just gonna blend this all in okay
once that's all blended out I don't have
a new powder to try out like a
translucent one so I'm gonna take some
of my Laura mess yeah in place now for
my eye shadow today I'm gonna be taking
being attached to dinner or not sunset
palette now I don't know if you guys
have seen but I'm not really a huge fan
of Natasha - no - a doze but I'm looking
at these colors and I'm like holy
like I really hurt this is good formula
might be changed
who knows let's find out what happens
sir I want to do something
haven't really done before so I'm gonna
take this yellow shade right here just
on a regular blending brush and I'm
gonna pop this in my crease cuz I'm
gonna use this as the transition for
today I'm excited to see how this
palette goes to be honest by the way
guys if you see my hair blowing around
in some clips it's because I've got a
fan next to me because it's so hot right
now literally can't even breathe
well--that's bit dramatic but you know
it's hot so I might need a fan
break every now and again just so I
don't overheat myself in this room
because I've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 lights
around me right now and they're all 500
LED or some and they produce a lot
of heat like literally I could heat my
room up if it was winter and that would
be my heater like that's how hot it is
plus the weather's hot outside and it's
gross so yeah just bear with me so far
this is blended into my crease really
really nicely it's like got a nice
transition it's like a nice smooth blend
okay so once that's all kind of nicely
blended I'm gonna go in with a different
shade
I'm gonna go images middle shade here
it's kind of like an orangey sort of
shade and I'm gonna pack that through my
crease
okay so this shade doesn't want to show
up literally at all we're off to a great
start and now it's just me
sideways instead I'm gonna try taking at
this shade up here it's gonna dip my
brush into that okay that shades looking
a little bit better so I'm just gonna
have to sit here for a while and blend
and like work with that and just oh god
this could work this could work out like
don't stress Michael all good okay so
this shade showing up a lot better than
that other one that literally had
nothing by the way I'm using the morphe
m4 double three brush I'm just gonna
take a little bit more of that yellow
shade that I used before and I'm just
gonna go out over the edge of that
orange shade just to kind of diffuse it
out a little bit and the two together
okay they blended together well I'm just
gonna pack on more of that orange and
see if I can build up the color a bit
okay that looks cool more like a like a
sunset sort of I I guess I'm gonna take
a little bit of that orange shade on
this brush here and kind of just blend
it into the yellow okay so I kind of
want to get like a darker sort of orange
so I've got this other palette here from
Natasha to known as Holiday Collection
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna try out this
orange shade it's just in the middle
here and I'm gonna see if I can deepen
up my crease a little bit using this
instead oh come on this is where the
pigments are holy okay this shade
is so good
that's just changed everything about the
whole look okay now as I pack that
orange on I'm just gonna slightly blend
it out and I'm gonna bring this orange
into my you know corner like in here and
gently buff that I'm just didn't take a
little bit more yellow that I used
earlier and just diffuse the edges with
that okay so once that flag down gonna
take in this icy shade and I'm just
gonna pop this under my brow bone just
to highlight it and make it pop I never
really highlight my brow bone to be
honest I just kind of like to sit there
and hang out by itself but today we want
to get the for use of the palette so
that's exactly what I'm gonna do
now from this same palette I'm just
gonna take this dark shade down here I'm
just gonna add a little bit of this to
my outer-v to see if it can give me some
more definition up in here just a net
out of pot our inlay I'll add I'm gonna
drink this bring this across I feel like
it opens up your eyes when you have
hooded eyes like this it opens your eyes
out if you are bringing to you in a
corner and now I'm gonna get back to
that orange shade from that little
holiday palette that I used going to
take a little bit of that on this brush
and just kind of go over the edges and
just like diffuse that line out a little
bit now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
take this shade right here and I'm gonna
be putting this on my lid I'm not gonna
do a cut crease today but I am going to
take a little brush or anything on there
yes there's black eyeshadow in it that's
not going to work on this what happens
when sometimes you don't clean your
brushes properly you just pop it on your
eye and there's all over it okay so
I'm going to take a small definer brush
and some of this eyeshadow it looks
extremely pigmented so yeah that looks
cool it's a very like wet consistency
and it's kind of chunky but it's
applying really well I'm just gonna kind
of pop that also I'm just gonna like a
blend it up into my crease cuz I don't
want like a harsh line of this at all
now then take that brush get a little
bit more fix+ up on there dip in and
just add a little bit more to get some
more pigment up in here not bad guys not
bad just gonna take this eyeshadow brush
that I've just been using foolishly the
whole entire thing and it just blend
around the edges a little bit oh wow
that looks better guys actually just
picked up this color and put a little
bit more about how to Dean it's a lot
more pigmented and like a better color
to use so I'm just gonna pop that on my
outer V and kind of drag it across and
then I'm taking my trusty little a
blending brush and a little bit more of
that orange eyeshadow and just diffuse
that out okay now that my eye shadow is
all done on the tops of my eyes I'm
gonna apply some Ascar this is the sea
art a London Wonderland miss scars is
very heavy duty it feels it's very heavy
wow this is good this is sorry black and
sorry good it reminds me of the two
faced better than sex and that's like
one of my favorite mascaras ever this is
why I don't talk when I do my mascara
now for my lashes today I'm gonna be
pumping on the Lily lashes these are in
the style kimono I don't think I've ever
used these before but this so fluffy and
big sorry I'm gonna pop these on and I
will be right back okay guys now that my
lashes are on I'm loving these lashes
now Sarge Americans are big and fluffy
and full I think they're my new favorite
lashes that I'm always gonna use but
let's move on to the skin so for primer
for primer today I'm gonna be testing
out this Smashbox photo finish
foundation primer oil free yay this
packaging is so cute it was the
collaboration that they did with MECA
firm mecca's 20 year anniversary so I'm
just going to take a little bit actually
it's a lot of that and just pop this on
on the skin seriously on this forehead
this hair needs to just get the out
of my face seriously all right right
 my breath had enough take step
back okay now moving on to foundation I
am very excited because I'm gonna be
trying out the new foundation and the
shade I'm gonna be trying is in the
shade shell now this is a high coverage
creme foundation I did swatch this on my
hand when I first got it and I was so
impressed and Lillian that has used it
and said that it's a really good sorry
I'm keen because I love a good high
coverage found fuck-off Dacian so I'm
gonna squirt some of this onto the back
of my hand it's very runny which isn't a
bad thing I'm just gonna taking my damp
Beauty Blender and then I'm just gonna
go straight up on in here I like it
already
this is the perfect color for me it's
got like that really pinky undertone
which is what I need
wow the coverage are you serious holy
hell I'm gonna do my ears too because
well I don't want a pink ears up in here
that has covered so much sorry well
Cam's gonna take a bit more just on my
Beauty Blender and guys just watch the
coverage and look how it feels so glad -
it feels like I'm not even wearing
foundation
this sarcoid that actually looks amazing
are you guys seeing this holy Lily
this Jew a foundation so good what the
 I'm gagging it says shake while in
the bottle true cuz it is like God
wailing oh or some like that
whoa Lily come look at this on my skin
bitch how good does it look and you only
need the tiniest little bidet all right
so I'm so impressed with this foundation
it's probably the best foundation I
think I've ever used coverage wise don't
know about we're test two yet but we'll
find out soon okay so now it's gonna go
back to that do your Skinit concealer
and I'm just gonna highlight my T's all
right now I'm gonna take my booty
blender and just blend this all out now
it's gonna take this concealer and just
highlight generously underneath my eyes
I thought I just got a stinging
sensation then but I didn't know it's
just me being a now I'm gonna take
my Beauty Blender and Garden town and
blend this all out
now I'm trying to dip into my Laura
Mercier powder and just generously bake
under my eyes now to set the rest of my
foundation I'm gonna be testing out the
Tom Ford what is this
Tom Ford flawless powder foundation so
this is the compact here very boozy run
up my asshole love it
and just dump that all over the rest of
my skin just to set all of my foundation
in place it does give you a really
airbrushed finish oh maybe that's the
jus a foundation absolutely dying over
my skin right now like it's never looked
this good before
bye okay now to finish off my under eyes
I'm just gonna zoom you guys in and I'm
just going to do like a little bit of
music playing just because I just want
to focus on it and just make it look
really good
okay guys so moving on to contouring I'm
gonna be taking this Smashbox palette
here it's actually really cool is that
do you do it like this it like changes
patterns that circle so in here we have
some eye shadows some contours some
blushes and stuff like that so I'm gonna
be using Dave's contour shades just here
today and see how they go on my skin I'm
just gonna take my little zueva luck
sheer cheek brush and I'm just gonna
take both of those shades just
generously on just brush and just
something in my eye
there's something in my eye some of your
Mac okay so I'm just going to wear
that's so gray
all right so instead of using the
courtroom one like both shadings going
to take the middle one which is more
warmer and that looks better to contour
for me so I'm just gonna use that shade
instead it's not going muddy or anything
which is an A+ because me with my muddy
contours and bronzers is a bit of a
shitshow
you know okay guys so now I'm just gonna
start trying to contour my forehead down
so it's not looking like an
International Airport as per usual you
know it's actually a really good contour
shade for me lack its contouring very
well it's blending very well Greta's
take a moment to appreciate this
off forehead if I ever got back into
body art this forehead comes in handy
I also contoured up my nose a little bit
as well but I do have a fully dedicated
video on how I drew that so I will leave
that link down below but anyone who is
interested now for my bronzer today I'm
gonna be trying out these CR Taylor
London South Beach bronze and now this
does look super super dark but we're
just gonna give it a whirl and see how
it goes I did swatch it on my hand it
was fine just kind of over the contour
oh yeah okay this is pretty this is
working nice yes
looking good so now it is time to
highlight I'm gonna be testing out the
Sephora golden a la I lied I got this
when I was in a Mary Connor that's what
it looks like on the inside so it's
super pretty I'm just gonna take a
little brush and see how this car is
that's very pretty the reason why I'm
using this little brush is because all
my highlighting brushes are going
missing literally I've had three and
they're all gone no idea where they are
so we're just gonna work with this
little baby today and the nose bridge
good I really like this and I'm pretty
sure this is quite an affordable brand
again how much this was actually I think
it was like to the $19 over $32 but as
you can see I've used a nurse brown my
face and this is packing on so well and
I like this color it's not too white and
it's not too yellow so when you look
straight on you can't really see it
just keep adding more now this for a
little bit of pop of color on my cheeks
I'm just gonna take the dress of colors
blush in the shade amazement just for a
little bit of something-something you
know just on here I'm not very big I'm
not a very big blush fanatic as you can
probably tell by now but I just like to
put a little bit on because it brings a
little bit of color back for my lip
liner today I'm gonna be trying out the
UA long-wear cream a lip planner this is
a machine this is in the shade
tawny rose so I'm gonna line my lips
with this okay now that my lips are
aligned I don't really like using lip
liner to be honest like I just find out
annoying and it gets in the way anyway
I'm just gonna take the Kevin D Ludwig
liquid lipstick oh the top of this and
I'm gonna blend the lip liner with the
liquid lipstick and see what happens now
I'm gonna take this little brush here
and we'll end them into each other
okay so my lips are all done and I
really like the way this looks now I'm
just gonna take the makeup forever mist
and fix and set everything on up my face
anyway guys this is the end of today's
video I really hope you guys enjoyed it
I'm super impressed with the shadows
that I used some from that palette with
pretty that's most of them really
good as you can tell I'm digging this
eye looks so much I thought my new pair
of favorite lashes I found a nude shade
sorry a new brand a foundation that I'm
literally obsessed with sorry I'm gonna
be using this all the time and just this
overall look I'm in love with the
highlight out was well sorry really
really good I love you guys so much and
always see you all in my next video bye
