sorry I'm actually recording this voice
over with a cold so if I didn't do it
with a cold there wouldn't be any video
today so the best I can do sorry about
it let's start off with the eyes today
guys first thing I'm doing is priming my
eyes with a base and to do this I'm
using the la girl concealer in the shade
porcelain kind of concealing my brows
with is true and then I'm just blending
it out with a brush to make sure that
it's seamless
now the first shade that we're going
into today is called Courtney this is
from a beauty killer palette obviously
this whole tutorial is raised right now
this is kind of going to be our
transition color now I did decide to put
down some sticky tape because I did want
to use this as a guideline to have a
really straight precise line and it does
help you when it comes to doing your gel
liner so I basically just blending that
into the crease and deepening up in the
outer V next color we're using star
power now this is kind of going to like
give it that sunset II sort of look and
I'm just blending that through my crease
as you can see right now
and then just going over the edge of
starpower just with some more Courtney
just to like blend it out it's all about
going backwards and forwards backwards
and forth such a process but it's so
worth it
next time we're going in with it is
called confession this is like a
cranberry sort of red color they're just
kind of deepen up the pink and not make
the pink look as pink if that makes any
sense whatsoever
I'm just taking confession just over the
outer V of my lid just to like deepen it
to training a spit just because I want
it to be like nice and like what about
I'm just going back in with some more
star power just over that cranberry you
know that's what I said going back and
forwards blah blah blah now we're moving
on to black rainbow and this is going to
be used to define my outer V and like
kind of create like some depth in that
crease area and this is where the sticky
tape is going to help you immensely with
this whole entire look
now the next Club I'm moving on to is
called China white and I'm just going to
use this to highlight my brow bone today
it's just like a matte white brow bone
highlight of color next color we're
moving on to is called princess and I'm
going to be using this is my lid color
now I did spray my brush with a little
bit of fix+
just to give off a bit of a better
pigmentation and I'm just blending that
into like the outer V as you can see I'm
just blending it all together now for my
eye liner today I'm going to be using
Maybelline studio gel liner in blackest
black and I'm using a little zueva
eyeliner brush for this I forget what
the number is called basically I'm just
doing my winged liner this is so easy to
control gel liner is really easy to work
with in my opinion depends on how thick
/ thin it is and then I'm just taking
the sticky tape off to reveal and not so
great line so I am taking a makeup wipe
just to clean that up
and using a makeup wipe to make your
eyeliner more flaky is a great thing
mascara is the Mac extended play we
don't need to know how to cross the scar
on lashes are the LAT and more lashes in
the style l'amour I'm not sure if I'm
saying that right more I don't know but
I'm using the House of lashes lash glue
pumping out letting it dry you know the
drill you know how I do that's how we go
if I can see yeah once your lashes are
on and then moving on to primer and I'm
trying a new prime minster davis's to la
girl primer
basically I'm just putting on rubbing
into my face and this was the first time
I used it I don't know what I'm looking
at there I don't know what I'm looking
at but yeah the prime is pretty good
next thing is that Chi Chi
cosmetics foundation this is in the
shade ivory the coverage is really great
but I did break out quite a bit after
using this I don't know whether it was
just my skin or the foundation that was
breaking it out don't know what
so don't know if I'll use it again
probably well Real Talk because like
look at its good coverage then I'm just
blending it out with a Beauty Blender
where my favorite thing in the world
because brushes to stipple our
foundation I mean it's good to apply but
you always got to finish with your
Beauty Blender hands always always
always now we are still blending okay
we're still bleeding oh okay now can
seal up this is elegant poke and still
out in the shade porcelain so friggin
good I know people ask where I got it
from so I got it from a site called Lady
Moss it's like five dollars or
something less than about four dollars
so good high coverage it's good to
contour with and highlight with contrary
meeting the darker shades I haven't
showed you guys that yet I'm still
playing around with it but um you know
the drill now I'm just taking my damp
Beauty Blender and I'm blending
everything out and I feel like this um
foundation look feel like this la girl
concealer buns out so so well such a
coverage I don't know I just can't get
over how cheap it is and how good it is
like I love it
it's a concealer that I probably can't
live without now I just can't get over
the price of it to like it's really good
my opinion everyone needs to have this
in their kit so good
for my powder to set my under eye so I'm
using the RCM a no color powder this is
my first time ever using this and it's
actually quite good I've seen Jacqueline
talk about it and I still need to play
with it a little bit more because I'm
not a hundred percent with it yet but I
did use it and I'm pretty happy with it
now we're moving on to powder this is
the nose powder in sorry the NARS press
powder in the shake Beach I'm just
telling my foundation with that and
dusting off some of the bake and I'm
leaving a little bit on underneath my
eyes because I still need to do the
bottom shadow basically what I'm doing
for eye shadow under my eyes is exactly
the same thing that I did on the top so
the Kourtney and then the the pink one
and then the cranberry one blending it
together and then I'm going in with
black diamonds on the outer V just to
bring my wing together with the bottom
lower lash line if that makes sense
basically I'm using the viewfinder to do
this because it's so hard to film when
you're looking in a mirror that's below
the camera okay excuse that me looking
into the viewfinder all the time now for
my bottomless car today I'm using the
Mac extended play gigablack lash like
ways to contour I'm using Halla face
powder from benefit I haven't used this
in a while and I don't think I'll use it
again I don't know why I just the
whatever telemarketers mmm don't
you just love in a relevant
phone call when you're trying to fill my
Bombers video anyway I'm just
contouring my nose a little you know it
was contouring that down as I need
to for bronze I'm using that it's all
about makeup runs lab with my benefit
runs a slash contour brush it's
awesome check out the gold so classy
obsessed love love love love love now
for my blush I'm using Milani Luminoso
I've been wanting to get this for so
long and I finally got it just a
drugstore product from America I'm
pretty sure I got mine on eBay third
would I love the color of it I love the
color
you have to highlight under my eyes I'm
using the Ofra but not a powder just on
a morphe brush to get what it's called
got the other day starting they're nice
and fluffy don't you love a good fluffy
brush
now for my highlighter today I kind of
suck this off because I really want to
use soft and gentle but I just wasn't
strong enough for me so I shook anyway
but then I moved on to the back of
champagne pot because it's like sloping
it's so pigmented so I just moved on to
that my Cupid's bow but nose the cheeks
high point to my face and then for my
lips today I use jeffree star mannequin
and that's pretty much it I hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial this is the
completed and finished look if you did

all in my next video so
