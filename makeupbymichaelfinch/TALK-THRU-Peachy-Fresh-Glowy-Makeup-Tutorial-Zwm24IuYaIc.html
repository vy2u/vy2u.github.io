today's video is going to be like a
peach inspired makeup control I want
everything to be like super like glowy
and peachy and pretty so basically I
would serve some stuff from Too Faced
including the sweet peach palette and
this palette has inspired me to do this
look so I want to do like peach eyes bit
of glitter maybe peach lip full coverage
of and controller highlighter all that
stuff everything I'm using I pretty much
haven't used before either so fabulous
love testing out new products it's great
fun love doing it on camera it's like a
full face of first impressions but I'm
just going to kind of go with the flow
and just whatever happens happened you
know so I hope you guys really enjoyed
this video and let's get straight into
the makeup okay guys now that I've got
you nice and close we're going to start
off with deep eyes and I'm going to be
using my holy grail concealer this is
the touch shape tape in the shade light
and I'm just going to put that all
across both of my lids so we have a
flawless base I'm end up going to take
my damp Beauty Blender and go straight
in for the kill now before that gives a
chance to crease I'm just going to take
a little bit of our CMA no color powder
and we're going to set that shit just a
generous amount so it does not crease
okay so the first shade I'm going to dip
into is called candied peach and it's
this beautiful orange e PG sort of shade
and can I just add this palette smells
so freakin good it's literally just
peaches if Too Faced ever came out with
a perfume I would be all up in that shit
because it would literally be amazing
like a peach flavored perfume scented
perfume I mean flavors of course I'd say
that so I'm just going to really pack on
that color and blend it we're like
really see you know I'm just really
building up the color so we have a nice
transition transition palette smells so
good okay I'm happy with that now I'm
just going to dip into the shade called
summer yum tap my brush off and I'm
finna go straight into
my outer-v now I want to keep this look
really like glowy and pretty I don't
want to make it like anything that black
or like full glam but it's me we never
know what's going to happen you know and
I'm just going to bring that up through
room and Cree I'm also just going take a
little bit of shade called puree just to
add in this is just going to slightly
darken the look but not make it too
overpowering do you not I mean I'm just
going to change my brush and keep using
those two Browns and I'm just going to
bring it up a little bit higher and kind
of blend everything together now I'm
just going to dip into the shade called
Bellini and I'm just going to spritz my
brush with a little bit of Explorer I'm
yeah cool and I'm just going to pop that
on my lid area and I'm going to kind of
bring it up all through my crease just
so there's something there yes that's so
like peachy and fresh and I've got my
leaky I here I don't know why my eyes
leaking way because i black film three
videos doing my eyes and my face is just
I had enough now for the fun part I'm
going to take these still are
magnificent metals glitter and glow
liquid eyeshadows fuck that's her name
isn't it and I'm going to take the shake
kit in karma this is kind of like a
peachy like silvery look I don't really
know so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to pop that on my lid okay now
once we've got that there I'm just going
to take that brush that I used before
and I'm just going to kind of blend that
up into the dark colors so there's no
like harsh line or anything like that
perfect okay I'm just going to do this I
I hate I have my eyes are uneven black
as in my actual eye shape like one of
these folds comes down more and
everything just gets fucked up I hate it
okay so that's all I think I'm going to
do for the eyeshadow I love this it's so
simple peachy glowy but effective do you
not I mean so let's go back and finish
the eyes later we'll do lashes mascara
all that jazz when my face is done okay
so moving on to the face let's prime
with the Too Faced
paulus skin rooting face primer I've
been wanting to try this for so long it
kind of looks like the benefit
Porefessional but like a little bit more
running up it definitely feels like the
professional and it
giving that whole blurring effect on the
skin like it's blurring its blurring my
skin which is great for blur at all
these imperfections you know what I'm
saying so if the foundation today I'm
going to be testing out the LA girl Pro
coverage h.d long-wear illuminating
foundation pro coverage well that's I'm
all about that life so yes I'm quite
keen this is in the shade fair so it
should be perfect for my skin tone right
now I think it's yellow undertone though
so don't mean don't read at me if it is
thinking so as I always do I'm just
going to squirt out on the back of my
hand probably three pumps for now and
then just going to take my sound good
Lee Dacian brush and I'm just going to
go to town okay it's very yellow
undertone which is fine someone's like
asshole oh my god just something else I
just wanted to say a lot of people
comment all the time on my videos oh my
god finally a video where you didn't win
jannat something hon it's my job to
whinge and judge products I'm here to
tell you if they're good or not or if
they work for me or they didn't work for
me so when I do my foundation I like to
do the bottom half first and then I do
the top half afterwards
I'm just going to spritz my brush with
some six-plus my brush my fucking
blender god I've had a long day alright
and good town
whoa sir I have to say I am so impressed
with the coverage the consistency the
blend ability at the build ability
everything of this foundation so far so
good
amazing I'm just going to do my big old
jolly forehead you know like the
coverage so the coverage so I am so
impressed you guys so impressed now for
my skin today I'm going to be trying D
kavanah Quan central skin enhancer now I
bought this because I saw stars by
Hirsch I think that's what her name is
Suroosh Ackerman when she was doing
Kylie Jenner's birthday makeup she used
this on her that's why I bought it
really a plus that was new in Mecca
I think Mecca in Australia just arted
stocking this it's very sick because
I've touched it before so what I'm going
to do is just do look I don't know if
I'm doing this right but don't shoot me
I'm just going to bring it up underneath
my eye I'm probably using way too much
someone comment down below and let me
know how to use this ship because I have
no idea what I'm doing I don't even know
if it's that this I don't think it's
meant to be used as a conceal is meant
to be added to concealer but I don't
care I'm just going to do like sharpen
up my eye shadow and then kind of bring
it down so yes I've just sharpened up
that eye shadow now I'm going to take my
damp Beauty Blender working how does
that look
works definitely conceals now I think
it's a bit too thick and I feel like
it's going to crease on these sounds
going to take some shape tape just to do
the rest of my face because I love this
product it's going to blend that up
again the weather is so nice outside
smart it's literally like about to rain
but it's not raining do not I mean now
I'm just going to bake under my eyes to
the RCM a you guys a little bit getting
me sick of using this but why fix it if
it's not broke it's amazing everybody
who watches my videos if you do makeup
you need this I'm also just going to
take a bit more of that our CMA and just
set the rest of my foundation I don't
want to use this foundation powder
because I want to see how this goes
coverage etc I'm just going to dust off
that under-eye bag too because we're not
really going to need that I don't really
want to do anything too intense under my
eyes now to contour a bit today I'm just
going to take the tackiest Pro glow
palette and I'm going to take these
sculpting Shea
and I'm going to start contouring my
face just tapping off the excess should
be you don't need one bomb so I'm just
going to start by crunching my forehead
because that's the biggest part that
needs to go oh my god the blend ability
of tarts bronzers or shit is that a bit
much that looks a bit much in the
viewfinder oh no oh God
probably is real soft but the blend
ability as these are just sore for an
eye even just the color of this contour
sculpting powder is stop it like you're
joking
me
all right so I've just popped some baked
on my cheeks and I'm just going to wipe
that off right now before it gets too
intense sometimes if you leave the rpma
on for more than 20 seconds yuck and you
have to start again now for blush I'm
going to be taking the Papa don't peach
blush from toothpaste as well and oh my
god love I'm going to make my brush size
fucking intense today a lot of us
I'm literally packing it on but I don't
care I love the way that looks stunning
now time to highlight you guys know what
that means
fix+ fucking empty it's going to take a
bit of the Urban Decay all nighter in
the bed to typically have to take my ass
to Mac because if I run out of six plus
car my videos you know I'm getting but
six plus is literally everything to me
everything so I'm just going to go back
into that for a glow kit from Tarte and
I'm going to take the shade called
strobe and maybe a little bit of Lex let
Sam you know and I'm just going to go I
lost my own estar to your highlighting
brush but one of my friends stole it I
think it's in my other makeup case but
fuck me dead seriously what the fuck

this look to look like it's glowy it's
fresh with a highlighter up here too
because I want to keep it fresh is you

gonna move on to mascara mascara mascara

mascara the one's looking a little bit
fucked I'm loving it
now guys when I oh ah you are joking
okay I'm not fucking talking this one is
clock I'm not using that mascara I have
just fucked my whole under eye are you
serious bindi oh what a mess that was
but honestly this mascara is amazing the
ones just really weird it's got like
three bits that stick out from each side
so you don't know when you're going to
jab yourself in the eye like I did and
this eye here keeps leaking I don't know
why I just been doing makeup all day so
my face has had enough and I managed to
fix that under there a little bit
there's a little bit of lack there but
hopefully you can't see that you know
I'm saying I'm just going to stick some
lashes on these are Lily lashes in the
style luck
okay so now I'm going to do lips and I'm
so excited to this lip combo this is the
lip land liquid a lipstick in the shade
and it's like a peachy nude color and
I'm so excited for it you ready Oh as if
this is not perfect to this look I
really wanted to get the Kylie cosmetics
the peach lipstick but I wanted to do
this tutorial today and I'm not waiting
for lipstick and this is literally
almost exactly the same so stunning okay
so I'm just going to let this liquid
lipstick dry off a bit before I apply a
pie before I apply a gloss seriously

inside out and goes back to front do you
not I mean
now I'm just going to take that still
art glitter eye shadow again and I'm
actually going to put some of my inner
corners oh my god I need to kind of
blend it a little bit because I don't
