channel so today I'm going to be doing a
video pretty much I just want to see if
these dupes of work so basically I went
on Pinterest it's a great way to see
dupes for makeup products Pinterest is
as full as so much and not spawn
and I've done so many supposed dupes on
there for high-end products so drugstore
dupes for high-end products pretty much
and today I'm going to be putting them
all to the test I managed to get a full
face together so you can see if there is
a difference at the end which I'm so
excited about because I really hope they
stand up to the groups that they're
apparently a meant to be without any
further ado let's get straight into this
video if you guys do enjoy it please
don't forget to give me a massive thumbs
up I love you and let's get straight
into it so first we're going to be going
in with the UH Nastasia brow powder and
a drink to that is meant to be the Alpha
brow powder as well so let's put these
to the test so I'm going to be doing the
high end products on this side of my
face and on the other side I'm going to
be doing the supposed cheaper droops
that they are meant to be and here
honestly this Anastasio brow powder is
everything hey man bring your dog gonna
come add a click hello come here yeah
it's Jenny Holmes a quick hello ah say
hello just really quickly talked as you
took all my time in my last what why do
you do that hold it like a baby then
this has been everyone I introduced
during my last video and yeah this has
been been say hello because I gotta kick
on with my video now darling my face I
just cleaned it ah okay continuing on
just putting this brow powder go through
my brows I'm living for like the brows
of the powdery look lightly rather than
Zi can you shut the up whoever's
out there oh my gosh I can fill them up
in here
not a problem you guys can hear that I'm
so sorry oh my god I think anything
would about top this brow powder it is
everything I think someone is literally
having a party next door they're not our
problem
okay guys moving on to the other eyebrow
will be taking the elf eyebrow kit and
I'm going to change my brushes because I
don't want no one
like oh you use the same brushes it's
got leftover residue on it so I'm moving
on to this brush here and I'm gonna take
as a powder and just go straight under
meaning it's literally doing the exact
same thing so just filling in the bottom
of my brow and looks more so just
flicking ha ha I'm so sorry if you guys
can hear that monstrosity going on over
there it's so annoying and loud that I'm
gonna go out there and start yelling in
two seconds then shut up
how can you be okay moving on to
brow tint this is the benefit gimme brow
and then to the droop of this is men
should be detent my brow by a stroller
so I'm gonna do the high inside first
basically what brands like this do is
they just give your brows like they give
them a little bit more of a full look
and they tint the hairs that the powder
doesn't stick to it starts looking more
full and a little bit more like bulky do
you not I mean now on the droop side I'm
just taking the Australis tint my brow
ruler literally don't exactly the same
thing this video is going to be
literally everything
so I wet my Beauty Blender for a change
and cleaned it look how the
bigger is it's normally like this
because it's like drowned in fix+
not today honey moving on to concealer
for today I'm going to be using the
heart shape tape concealer and as the
pros dupe is meant to be the LA girl Pro
concealer now I know as a very very
often often EULA as this concealer that
this is not the same but it's very
similar to a lot of kick-ups is a lot of
sinner but I guess it gives the kind of
the same kids shirt stop back up I'm
trying to film as I was saying before I
was really interrupted by the kids this
is a lot of sinner answers I love see
how so let's give it a go so I'm always
living for the tight shape tape and the
shittest ship does it's literally
everything to me okay now for the
apparent drip side I'm going to be
taking the LA girl Pro concealer and the
shade porcelain the only thing I'm
noticing different about this right now
is the color it's a mock with more
yellow toned
that doesn't matter good now I'm just
going to conceal now don't take the
touch shake tape and pop that ball over
my lid and then on the other side I'm
going to take some more of the other
girl Pro concealer and we'll be painting
that all across now I'm going to take my
damp Beauty Blender and
a blend is concealer hour I'm going to
flip the beauty blender over and blend
out this side of the concealer now when
you put them side by side it's like yes
okay now is going to take a little bit
of translucent powder and just set my
legs in place I couldn't find a drupe
but I actually had Shiar flora
translucent powders so it's going to be
skipping that translucent powder mascara
is the only thing we're going to be
skipping today everything else
I literally have tubes for now moving on
to eyeshadow I'm going to be taking the
UH Nastasia Beverly Hills Modern
Renaissance palette and the chichi
spices palette now I tried this once
before and I didn't like it but I'm
going to give it another go because once
before I've tried the multi eyeshadows
and I hated them but then I gave it
another go like six months later and I
literally fell in love with them so I
 believe that I need to start
giving everything more of a second show
second third or fourth chance with
makeup because I feel like I use it once
and if I don't like as I don't like it
but I need to see if I can change that
up so for my trend edition color I'm
going to be going in with a little bit
of burnt orange from the UH Nastasia
palette I'm just going to pop that in my
outer crease and start blending this up
okay now on the drugstore side I'm going
to be taking some of this shade here
that looks very similar to burnt orange
on a different different blending brush
okay okay I'm just going to be popping
that through my crease same as I did on
the other side okay already I can tell
that these are not as pigmented is the
honest after I shadow but that's a
pretty obvious thing and I'm just
blending that up through my crease as
well okay now on the high-end side I'm
gonna be taking some over a real bar
which is this beautiful orange shape
that I literally just over and I'm just
going to be putting out a little bit
below my transition color and I'm just
going to blend that out with a little
with Morris burnt-orange then on the
drugs items can be taking some of this
orange from each entry palette and once
again just going on my out of V and
bringing it up through my crease
okay the difference I can see from this
so far is it's got quite a bit of fall
out but the color is exactly the same as
a real guy I'm just blending out that
orange with a little tiny bit of that
brown color that we used previously now
I'm going to be taking a little bit of
Cypress foam bar where this name ever
and I was going to put a little tiny bit
of that too somewhere out of V just to
bring it a little bit of definition or
kind of halfway across my crease then
I'm going to go back in with a little
bit of real guy which is that orange and
kind of just blend out that Brown that I
just put down and now back to this side
I'm gonna be taking some of this dark
brown shade and a little bit of this
Blacky sort of shade coming off the
excess shift you don't need and just a
little bit into my outer V as well it's
literally doing the exact same thing or
even - it's probably a bit too black not
our problem
I'm just going to take a little bit of
that orange they used before and see if
I can blend out this color that I just
laid down perfect
moving onto my lid shade into the
high-end side I'm going to take this
shape called Primavera now I'm just
going to pop that all across my lid
which I pigmented even without fix+
and then on the drugstore side I'm going
to be taking at this end shade here and
it's so powdery so I'm just going to
take a little bit of the elf makeup
setting this cuz I know that will not
apply very well without it
nothing's really showing up with the
shade maybe I try using my finger I hate
doing em definitely not a signatures as
the other one I mean this under okay
moving on to the face I'm going to be
using these Smashbox photo finish primer
on this side and a supposed group is
meant to be the ALF face hydrating
primer so I don't think you can actually
tell a difference by looking at what
primers can do besides pore fessional
because that will literally blurs your
skin
but I know you can definitely feel and
maybe throughout the day you can tell a
little bit now this side I'm going to be
taking the owl face oh it doesn't very
similar very similar consistency - oh my
god it feels the actual same just a
little bit more wet oh my god it smells
like a factory though moving on
to my favorite part time for foundation
on the high-end side I'm going to be
trying to make up with a HD foundation
and on the exposed group I'm going to be
using the Revlon new complexion
foundation now apparently a lot of the
Revlon foundations are very very similar
to the Make Up For Ever HD foundation
alright so I'm just going to be applying
the makeup for a bar we've got weather
effect turn on oh my god so I'm just
going to be buffing this into my skin
I've never really been a huge fan of
this foundation so like it's not the
greatest coverage like you need to mix
it with something like the Marc Jacobs
remarkable or something to get like that
a coverage because I feel like when you
mix foundations you get the best result
okay it's doing my forehead now I'm
changing my brushes guys so chill okay
and now on role on this side I'm going
to be taking the Revlon foundation it's
so runny it might not be a bad thing
though okay and we're just going to go
straight in on not bad you guys it's
literally doing the exact same thing as
the makeup forever if not it applied
better than the makeup forever
from what I can tell this looks
exactly the same as the side not a
problem okay
literally goodbye because this looks
exactly the same exactly the same
coverage even what the actual kick now
that I'm looking like a literal Oompa
Loompa I'm going to be moving back onto
concealer now on the high end side I'm
going to be using G Todd shape tape I
don't know how I'm going to like halfway
do a little bit on my nose I'm going to
make this work on now I'm going to blend
this out and then go wash my Beauty
Blender
now let's see if this looks like the
high end so I'm just going to take the
LA girl Pro concealer now this is a
little bit of a different color so that
will affect the way it looks but it's
not going to affect the coverage and
what it does so let's have a sus now
can't we getting up to wet my
Beauty Blender so I'm just gonna turn
around to this side like there's any
product on there anywhere god it's not
going to accept it blending is art
already I can tell that it's not apply
you'll really be able to tell when I do
underneath my eye this actually blends
out easier than the tile check tape
because it's a thinner consistency but
the tight shape tape has better coverage
okay
does it look much different I literally
don't see any difference whatsoever
which is amazing because this is the
whole point of this video now moving
back onto my under eyes as I said
earlier I don't have a jew-fro
translucent powder ceramic and taken of
my dermablend and just sit on in under
my eyes and then I'm also just going to
set my t-zone okay guys now moving on to
foundation powder on the high-end side
I'm gonna be taking the mac studio fix
powder this is MC 45 so I'm just going
to apply this like I normally would
love-love-love such full coverage I live
now a supposed rip - this is the
Australia expression flawless this is in
the shade medium tan so I'm just going
to search the rest of my face with this
moving on to your contouring I'm going
to be taking the whole up light on this
side and the NYC smooth skin bronzer so
I'm just going to contour on this side
of my face
I love the benefit haul-away and haul up
but I love pull away even more because
it's so much more buildable and haller
the regular haul alone call Allah is
quite dark but with this you can build
it up and its really good for paler skin
tones as well it's going to run a little
bit of up down the side of my nose okay
now going in with the NYC bronze art
it's a matte bronzer as well because
hoola light is matte oh yeah I can see
this and then just running a little bit
down the side of my nose as well I'm not
really contouring today I'm just kind of
growing in you know what I mean now for
bronzer I'm going to be going in with
the Too Faced milk chocolate Soleil
bronzer and on the Dukes item will be
taking deep Bahama Mama by the balm
bronzer now I know the bomb isn't
considered drugstore some places but in
Australia where I'm from it is because
it is available at Target and target is
classified as a drugstore so that's why
I'm using it in today's video so I'm
gonna take a little bit of the milk
chocolate Soleil oh my god it smells
poor what I literally just want to eat
it and I'm going to be bronzing up my
face a little bit more this is so good
it's literally 99% cocoa powder I think
oh my god oh my my mouth ah and then
back to the drugstore Adams gonna be
taking a little bit of the homonym as it
and just popping that on my cheek a
little squats here this side has gone a
little bit muddy not muddy but just like
a little bit you know hard to blend out
maybe it's the brush I'm using I don't
know because I'm changing brushes so
much about like it's still doing the
trick do you know what I mean now the
blush on the high-end side will be
taking max blush baby and on the group
side I'm going to be taking the Milani
powder blush in the shade romantic rose
and these literally look identical so
I'm going to take a little bit of this
Mac blush on my cheeks and brush
backwards like backwards meaning that my
because I feel like it just applies
better okay where I learned that from I
think it was makeup my Mario I think or
maybe it was her oh Sh
I'm not sure because you're going back
to front so you're not applying to blush
directly on your cheek I guess I don't
know and now on to the drugstore silence
and they're taking some of the Milani
you live it was not gross
here's one is definitely not as
pigmented but it has the exact same
color I literally cannot tell a
difference this whole video and this
video is being a success so far okay now
back onto the high-end side I'm just me
taking some of burnt orange straight
underneath my lash line but actually I'm
not going to do that I'm not going to do
that I'm actually going to take the
shade called Venetian red so I can
change the color block a bit so you guys
can see the difference and I'm going to
be popping Venetian red directly under
my lash line now it's going to take a
little bit of burnt orange and I'm just
going to blend that down
going back into my chichi spices palette
I'm going to be taking this reddish
shade here it's more of a shimmery shade
and I'm just going to be putting this
straight under my lash line on this side
so already with this I can see that it's
not as pigmented as the opposite side
and it's a little bit patchy but it's
still doing something and that's all we
care about here it's going to dust away
that's for that before it my
undereyes up severely then I'm going to
take some more of that a brown shade and
just blend this reddish color out now I
don't have any dupes for mascara at the
moment so I'm just going to be using my
benefit roller lash was going to pop
this on and then I'll be straight back
now another thing that I unfortunately
don't have a dupe for is the lashes that
I'm using today these are huda beauty
Audrey favorite lashes ever from here to
be here they are amazing and I wish I
had a drink for them but I don't so I'm
just going to stick these on I'm sorry
I'll once again at the are they okay now
that my lashes are on let's move on to
facial spray so on the high-end side I'm
gonna be using the Mac 6 classicism I go
through I love you so much and then I'm
going to be moving on to the Alf makeup
and setting this so I'm just going to do
a few squirts on the side and then a few
squares of the Alf on this side really
want to highlighter
today I'm going to be using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills Lacroix go-rap
Nicole Nicole Guerrero Nicole Guerrero
highlighter palette glow kit and then a
supposed route that it is the new BH
Cosmetics spotlight highlight six color
palette okay so I'm just gonna go
straight in with this color right here
this like pretty much just a white shade
oh my god it's so beautiful
this highlight palette is literally
everything and it's one of my favorites
it's going to bring that up a little bit
around there oh my gosh this me so
hard like a look at that amazing now on
the drip side I'm going to be taking at
this shade just up here from the BH
Cosmetics palette so this is obviously
my purple tone and this is a completely
different color but it's so pigmented
that's stunning
check out that it's very champagne E and
like completely different to this but I
mean like it's applying exact same oh my
god this color it doesn't look like it
be a dark like champagne e color but
it comes off so champagne II that is so
nice
holy now I'm going to put a little
bit on this side of my Cupid's bow now
is going take a little bit of the Nicole
Guerrero palette just to do this item a
Cupid's little bow yeah sorry different
but it applies the same does that make
sense
moving on to liquid lipstick on the high
end side I'm going to be using the Too
Faced melted lipstick in the shade
melted nude but it's so nice and then on
the drip side I'm going to be taking the
Milo cosmetics Ivy's are liquid a lip
paint and I'm just going to pop this on
it's almost identical this is a little
bit more orange turn this is a little
bit more like and warmed not warm time
bit more Brown tone this is more orangey
toned and this is more bit more Brown
toned now for the last thing today I'm
going to be taking the Mac creme Sheen
cream machine lip glass in the shade boy
BAE this is stunning and a supposed
group is the NYX butter gloss in the
shade fortune cookie so it's going to
have a luminous on this side and then on
the droop side imma take it looks
exactly the same but I'm not kidding I'm
going to take a little bit of this now I
don't have any setting spray droops
because setting sprays or setting sprays
and they're all completely different or
are they who knows we'll never know I'm
just going to take a little bit of
six-plus and just spritz it all over my
face just to make everything look a
little bit less cakey so guys this
brings us to the end of today's video I
really hope you guys enjoyed it can you
guys notice the difference at all I mean
like I really can't I'm so impressed
with the foundation it was literally
identical to the Makeup Forever HD do
anything different about a few things is
just the color and the pigmentation like
the color of the highlighters is a
little bit different the pigmentation of
the eyeshadows is also a little bit
different and the color of the lipsticks
are a little bit different but other
than that I'm pretty good if you
guys enjoyed this video or if you would
like to see a part two I could make this
a series on my channel
