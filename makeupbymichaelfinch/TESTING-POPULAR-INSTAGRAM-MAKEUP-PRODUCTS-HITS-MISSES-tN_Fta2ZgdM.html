new video so in today's video I am gonna
be doing a full face using Instagram a
viral and makeup so pretty much if you
don't know what that is it is just
makeup but I've seen all over Instagram
and it's pretty much just been hyped up
to be something amazing so I've got a
bunch of makeup in front of me that I'm
gonna test out and see how it all goes
now if you don't follow me on my other
social medias you would not know that I
just got back from the USA actually I
uploaded two vlogs so you might know um
if you haven't seen them two videos ago
go check him out la in New York City
amazing so I actually got the chance to
grow interests of for their old tasks
CVS and they've got a bunch of different
makeup over there that they don't have
available in stores in Australia
although I can can get online I just
chose not to
I got it in store so it so without any
further ado let's get straight into this
video and I'm so glad to be back filming
I literally just got off the plane like
11 hours ago so I had a five-hour flight
from New York to LA and then LA to
Brisbane which is like 20 hours of
flying all up so I'm a little bit under
the weather but other than that let's
get straight into it if I start at any
point in this video if I don't know what
I'm saying
I'd probably be jet-lagged kicking in
because I'm a little bit all over the
place at the Murray but I need to film I
need to get back into it so let's do it
okay guys we're gonna be starting off
with my eyes today oh by the way I don't
have acrylics on this is weird my hands
look like tree stumps let's move on and
ignore the fact that I have tree stumps
for hands okay let's zoom you guys in
hello everyone nice and close okay first
thing I'm gonna be testing out is this
Lancome teint Idole ultra wear
camouflage concealer now I'm gonna be
using this as an eye base today so let's
see how this goes I picked this up when
I was in Sephora and I love their
foundation a teen idol so I thought I
would try the concealer okay so getting
a little bit thick on my hands but not a
bad thing you know so I'm just gonna
prep actually actually I really wanted a
sticky type method because I haven't
done that in so long and I really do
like it straight under there straight up
to the corner of the brow you know sorry
anyway going back to that concealer I'm
just gonna take a little bit and a
little bit girls along the way by the
looks of things here too and I'm just
gonna bring this all the way up I did
pre conceal my brows before but I didn't
use this concealer and my eyebrows are
already done because I don't have any
new bra things to use for this video so
we're just gonna heart for the best and
see what happens
I'm just gonna take my damp Beauty
Blender and I'm just gonna blend this
concealer out concealer oh my god I've
been in America for ten days and I've
already picked up the accent no I
haven't I haven't I swear okay this
blends out super well it's super full
coverage as I said before it is very
thick but okay moving on to setting my
eyelids I'm gonna be testing out the
infallible Pro matte foundation powder
from L'Oreal this is a part of their Pro
matte total color collection I guess you
could say so I'm just going to take a
little bit of that and set these lids in
place so they do not move or so the
concealer doesn't move so say now for my
eye shower today I'm gonna be testing
out the Sephora Pro palette this is the
warm slash towards charge-charge wall I
don't know how to say that CH a UD es
someone please let me know in the
comments below because I'm really great
at pronouncing things so this palette is
all warm colors so if you don't want to
see me do a warm color look then feel
free to click off because I do them all
the time and I know you guys to
give them but I didn't want to get this
palette just you try it out because the
colors are to die for
i'ma dig into this let's get into it
till I'm excited to see how this goes
actually it's got a black in there I'm
really happy about that already
I love this palette already sorry I'm
just gonna take the white shade out of
the top corner and I'm just gonna go
over my brow bone just to set up and see
Lafley going about this transition nice
sort of shade I'm just gonna take this
straight through my craze okay pigment
let's do it I'm ready for a full glam
look you know I haven't done my makeup
in about ten days so bring it on
Sephora Pro I'm just gonna kind of
incorporate some of the orange
transition color that's sitting in this
palette as well and mix the two together
so I'm Lurky already obsessed with this
palette and I've only done my transition
well my god I think my washing machine
just shoot itself be right back
what that i washing machine is fine it's
just me being over exaggerated it
honestly is not I'd like a blowout
though the pigment in this palette is
just like so good
holy I see a new favorite palette
coming the through okay so now I'm
gonna go into this like deep maroon
Brown Shay my god obsessed with this
palette
are you serious okay guys and I'm gonna
bring that all the way for my crazy okay
now I'm gonna dip into the black out of
that same palette
it looks sorry pigmented oh my god yes
oh you guys seeing how pigmented
this is wowie
it's gone oh my god well bye good
 bye oh my god this is the most
blackest eyeshadow I think I've ever
used in my lecture life yeah I'm gonna
see if I can blend that out with the
color that I just used before
I'm very impressed you guys like
I'm blowing out of the literal wah
well has been beached again hey guys now
I'm gonna dip into this gold shade just
here out of the palette I'm just gonna
spritz my brush with a little bit of
fix+
well now I'm gonna kind of blend around
the edges of that gold that I just put
down just to make sure there's no harsh
lines and everything's just kind of
chillin in the right spot you know now
I'm gonna take some of the lighter gold
out of the pallet I'm just gonna pop
kind of closer to my inner corner now I
don't have a new liner to test out but
I'm quickly just gonna go across the top
of my lid with the English gel liner in
77 okay guys now for mascara I'm gonna
be testing out the lash paradise from
L'Oreal this packaging reminds me so
much of beachy face better than dick all
right so I'm gonna cut these lashes okay
so that was like nothing special this
mascara but it does the job nothing
amazing so I don't know what was their
 hype top now lashes on Instagram
it's always who to beauty or Lilly
ghalichi I strongly believe in both
brands of lashes I love them sorry much
this is one of my favorite pairs I've
won them so many times these are Audrey
by her to beauty I have tried them
before but I'm definitely if you want
some amazing lashes that last a long
time definitely check out who the
beauties or Lilly ghalichi because
they're both incredible
so guys I'm just gonna quickly pop these
on off-camera and I'll come back and
we'll get started on my face I'm so
excited
guys just a little trick if you ever
have lashes that have like if you've
like used them before if you have like
glitter or glue all over them just grab
some of your gel liner and I just paint
over where all the is and it just
covers it up and dries and it's perfect
I think these lashes are definitely part
they used by a day I think this is gonna
be the last time I wear them and I'll
have to get some new ones because these
are just okay guys so getting
started on the face I'm gonna be taking
this for Sally unicorn essence now I've
seen this everywhere and I'm so late on
the bandwagon for this one but let's
give it a whirl oh it's pink
literally pink in a tube I'm just gonna
put on my hands
and pop it on my face oh it smells like
candy it smells like a really nice it
smells like Jolly Ranchers no it doesn't
it smells like something better than
that
now I don't know what sorry like amazing
about this and why it was so hyped
because to me it's not doing anything
magical to my skin so overrated but no
it can be used as like a I just got it
in my mouth it can be used as
like a primer or like applied off to
moisturizer or something like that I
don't really know I don't really know
what I'm saying but um okay that's on
now moving on to foundation I'm gonna be
testing out the milk makeup blur liquid
foundation now I have seen so much about
this that it's really good coverage so
I'm just gonna start by spreading a
little bit on the back of my hand just
that much for now until not much and
then I'm just gonna take a regular
foundation brush and I'm just gonna
I might just daughter all over my face
and then blend it in with a Beauty
Blender now I'm still be taking up my
damp Beauty Blender and blending this
out the coverage is good Wow
holy this is so good and for the
amount that I owe that looks weird for
the amount that I used it's covering a
lot it's literally covered everything so
Wow okay I'm impressed I'm
impressed just love it when makeup
products work out for you generally me
I'm just gonna squirt a little bit more
out on the back of my hand and it drew
my forehead once again just blend that
all out damn that looks so good now
moving back on to concealer I'm just
gonna be taking the Lancome T and I Joel
ultra where and I'm just gonna do a
little bit of concealing on my nose my
chin Cupid's bow on my forehead and then
I was gonna blend this out oh my god you
guys I am loving the combo of this
foundation and this concealer okay now
I'm just gonna conceal my under eyes but
just conceal all alright so I'm just
gonna stop blending this in it's
concealing well Jordan like the
consistency of it for the under eye area
though just because he is so like thick
and like conical
lucky but I mean it's covering
everything up pretty well moving on to
fake this is the taut smooth operator
Amazonian clay finishing a powder now I
hope it doesn't have flash back because
if it does you guys are gonna
hear about it so I'm gonna top some of
that out into the lid and then I'm just
gonna pop a little bit under here just
with my Beauty Blender and I'm just
gonna take it all over my nose holy
it's so finely milled it's going
everywhere okay I'm just gonna kind of
let that sit there and while that's
sitting there I'm just gonna be taking D
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte foundation
powder I guess and I'm just gonna run
over the rest of my face and kind of set
all the rest of my foundation so it
don't move I really don't look how this
hot pad assets on my skin it's kind of
like I don't know I really do not like
the finish of it anyway let's finish off
underneath my eyes so I'm just gonna
take the Inglot gel liner again I'm just
gonna quickly line at my waterline now
I'm gonna take that dark maroon Brown
maroon Brown just the dark brown and I'm
just gonna stop by smudging not like
straight underneath so I'm pretty much
it's gonna be doing the same thing that
I don't top of my eye but instead
straight underneath my eye and then I'm
gonna take that really light orange e
shade and I'm gonna blend that straight
underneath all of that but I'm just
gonna grab an even denser brush and I'm
gonna take that black eyeshadow just a
tiny because it is so pigmented and put
it right up against my lash line and
then I'm gonna blend that down now for
my bottom mascara I'm just gonna take
the lash paradise wow that's so good for
bottom lashes now because I do not have
a new contouring / a bronzing thing to
try I try to find one but I just like
and good until the try them all so I'm
just gonna be taking the puck a princess
contour kit from Tarte and I'm gonna be
taking this shade and just contouring my
little whole face it's literally my
favorite bronzer / poncho act ever so
I'm gonna be using this as my bronzer
for today bronze up this fuck-off
forehead then to throw the contour a
little bit more I'm gonna take the u
sculptor to contour kit from it
cosmetics and I'm going to take this
cool trend shade and just go straight up
on in here
now to highlight today I'm gonna be
taking the Maybelline New York master
chrome metallic highlighter in the shade
molten gold now I have seen this
everywhere on everyone's
instagrams in the past I don't know
three months so i'ma see if it's really
that good swear every single time people
come to my house all my highlighting
brushes go missing I don't know where my
morphe one is my honest RCA one
who the stole at this time i right
okay so I spray my face with nothing and
nothing's really showing up
maybe I should spritz my brush with a
little bit of the mac fix+ now we're
gonna have a of Bloodshy highlight
I'm kind of learning to like not hate
the product straight away I kind of like
try and work with it do you know what I
mean because lately I've just been like
no I hate it then everyone's like try it
again and then I do and then it doesn't
work again
hashtag does it dusk okay so I'm gonna
bring this highlight off pop this side
of my cheek okay so it's not that bad
but it's not that great do you not I
mean like I'm spending quite a bit of
time trying to get pigment on there so
I'm pretty sure this is the first
highlighter I've ever used where I've
directly sprayed my brush with mac fix+
and it doesn't go blotchy like it's
blending out well it's not going chunky
like all my other highlighters dude
that's so weird I'm kind of impressed
it's all about making the product work
but when I look straight on it kind of
looks yellow on my cheeks and I don't
really like that okay let's do this cute
goodbye step up a little bit on my inner
corners as well just dust it in there
okay guys to set my face I'm gonna be
trying out the glam blur glory sets our
makeup setting spray this bottle is so
cute must I add superfine which is good
where the is it getting on my face
the Miss star is definitely good because
it's so fun and it kind of like goes on
evenly gives you that nice look now for
my lips I'm gonna be testing out
something that has gone literally viral
on social media lately this is the sea
tayyar London a glitter flip liquid
lipstick so it's meant to turn into a
glitter you have to like rub your lips
together or some I don't know
so this is a like red color it's
probably not gonna go with my eye look
but it's for the video sorry it let's do
it
Wow okay oh my god I can hear an
ice-cream truck
oh my god it means that memories okay
now I don't really know what to do I
don't know if I'm allowed to rub my lips
together yet I think you have to let it
I'm drooling I think you have to let it
go a little bit tacky I the
corner out badly okay so I think it's
like semi dry so let's do it
Wow glad I came out my god this
literally glitter on my lips now okay
that's so cool but it doesn't feel good
it does not feel nice on the lips and
it's gone kind of patchy in the middle
like the lipstick itself is going kind
of patchy but I mean it's pretty cool
I'll give it that it's pretty cool
anyway guys I hope you really enjoyed
this video if you did make sure you give
it a massive thumbs up I love you guys
so much and I will see you all in my
next video bye see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
