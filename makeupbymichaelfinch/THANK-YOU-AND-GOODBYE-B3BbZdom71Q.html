channel so this video that I'm filming
right now is actually gonna be the last
video for this year 2017 has gone so
quickly just as everybody else says but
it actually has been one of the busiest
and craziest years of my life so far and
I'm so excited for 2018 because I know
for a fact it's going to be started but
I've got so much stuff planned
so me it's not a thing to tell
you guys and so many amazing holidays
and trips and stuff that I'll be going
on so next year you guys are gonna find
all out about that but I just wanted to
do this video to just kind of go over
what I've done this year and yeah just
like a few best moments so yeah
so definitely one of my highlights for
this year was my Melbourne made out that
I did with Sephora and benefit it was
absolutely incredible over 5,000 people
turned out unfortunately I could only
meet like 1500 but that was so
incredible that took around seven hours
it was so good I had so much fun I was
sorry dead by the end of it obviously
but that was definitely one of my
favorite things of this this year yeah
this year
the second thing is my melbourne master
class and my master class is in general
I've just done my malbim one and my
Sydney one that would birth phenomenal
and I still have Adelaide Perth New
Zealand and Brisbane cigar sir yeah if
you're interested in coming to one of my
master classes there is tickets still a
few left sorry link down below
self-priming
okay guys I'm gonna take need morphine
Beauty funds which you guys pumping
I obviously I got to travel to America
with some of my best friends we had the
best as time as you guys know as long as
that everyone notices how really my
friends talk to me use me to get sunny
you what is the mandatory drop it's guys
yelling at the police every day so your
horse gallop down Melrose is that not a
ramen noodle shop
Margaret Morrison and something that I
didn't really set for a goal I don't
think I don't really like setting goals
sometimes because if I don't like hit
them in time it kind of upsets me a nun
motivates me but we hit 500k this year
which is incredible I would never ever
ever have imagined to hit that amount of
subscribers on YouTube which is insane
we are so close to 700 K and my goal for
next year is to be at a million and
disliked that just gives me goose bumps
all over my body like if I ever hit
Emily on you on YouTube I'd be like is
this am i dreaming like what the actual
 like I'd never imagined that this
many people would be interested in
watching my videos so it's been so
awesome so far so yeah my goal for next
year is a million subscribers by the end
of 2018 can we do it I think we can how
can I forget me and shiny came out with
merchandise on SG the label we have
t-shirts and bags and all that sort of
stuff that's been phenomenal I love
seeing you guys wearing everything you

so so cool so yeah that is some of the
best moments of 2017 I love you guys so

cheesy but it needs to be said thank you
