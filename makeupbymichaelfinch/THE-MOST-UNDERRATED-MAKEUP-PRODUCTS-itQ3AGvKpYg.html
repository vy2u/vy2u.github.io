today I'm going to be doing a video on
the most underrated makeup products
so basically underrated makeup products
is ones that I don't think I've spoken
about enough and it is quite a few of
products that I've got here in front of
me before I get into today's video I
would just like to say that this video
is sponsored by Best Fiend so for those
who don't know best scenes is a free
puzzle adventure game basically what you
need to do is build and collect a team
of scenes to defeat a specific blog and
all you need to do is match the same
colored objects on the game this month
best friends is having the biggest
update ever they've added over 100
levels where you can play this
summertime event and you can win a huge
reward
and the thing that I like about is the
most is you can play it without internet
connections so if you want to fly and
you don't have Wi-Fi like this you can
play it if you guys download the app
using my link below and you'll get $5
free worth of diamonds and gold ok guys
so here is the game I'm currently on a
level 106 so I'm just going to show you
guys basically how to play it so
basically what you need to do is this is
a slug that I was talking about that you
needs to see so basically all you need
to do is a much updates by this here
roam so this is your team of beings here
and you just need to kill this little
guy right here
okay guys without any further ado let's
get straight into all these underrated
makeup products that I have to
okay guys look at straight into the
products so the first one I want to talk
about is probably the essence shape your
face contouring palette so basically I
do this in quite a few drugs for videos
and I'm literally obsessed with it I
don't actually use it enough only
because I use this shade or only so I
tend to go for things that I use more of
all of the shades in but if I am doing a
drugstore video I had a percent growth
it is I haven't actually tried these
what I really should I think that's
meant to be a highlighter and that's
meant to be I'm not really sure but this
is such a good formula it blends so well
and it doesn't go at muddy which is
perfect and what you want in every
single drugstore palette the next thing
I'll talk about is also a contouring
palette this is the elf contour palette
once again I only use this actually no
light I use both of these shades here I
think this is a highlighter I haven't
actually tried them and I think that's
just a face powder as well but I
definitely use these two these both have
the formula of a super high-end contour
they just blend they don't blend away
you know how some contours tend to blend
away and you're left with nothing
yeah it doesn't do that so yeah
basically I use this one and this one
and if you've been watching my videos
for a while you would know I'm literally
obsessed at this and it is my favorite
drugstore contour palette okay guys the
next thing I want to talk about is its
foundation from the Tasha Jinora it is a
full coverage and it says fruit complex
in there so I don't know if that means
it's got fruit in it or it just smells
like fruit
I haven't actually smilers before honest
I've used it but I've never smelt it
which is weird because normally
everything I put on my face as well but
it's super super SuperDuper full
coverage it's really really a really
nice consistency and it does blend out
super well I was actually sending NPR
and I got five different colors of them
so I gave the ones aren't my colors to
all of my friends but I feel like it is
a really good foundation and I don't
reach for enough because I feel like
Natasha generated a little bit hard to
get for some people so I tend to use
brands that are a little bit easier to
get like in Sephora or makeup but if you
are interested in trying in a new
foundation that's super full coverage
and super good quality I would highly
recommend being etosha turner foundation
X it's called foundation X that is not a
problem the next thing I want to talk
about is this Becca as a matte poreless
priming
so now I only just discovered this the
other day I've had it for quite some
time now but I used it in the video that
I did with my friend Ronny so if you go
back and look at that I don't actually
know if I put this part in where I was
like freaking out because my skin was so
matte like it was literally sorry matte
so if you are oily this is going to be
perfected for your skin type because
literally I put it all over my face and
I was like well like my skin is so tight
and like dry feeling like not gross but
it really does live up to its name it is
seriously super super matte so if you
ever get the chance to test this out
test it out and you'll know exactly what
I mean like my face was literally it was
blurred it was blurred like you know how
professional blurs your skin it blurred
my face and it also mattified everything
in my foundation went on flawlessly the
next thing I want to talk about is this
elf eyebrow kit this is in the shade
medium I don't actually tend to go for
the gel sort of site I tend to use just
more the powder side but I think it is
that good and the reason why I'm putting
this in this video is because I feel
like you don't have to spend a lot of
money on eyebrow product because
literally you can just use a brown
eyeshadow if you're on a budget and you
have to but honestly you can get this
from came out it's like five dollars
amazing so moving on to next product
this is the Maybelline master conceal
down I don't know why I have never ever
in my life seen another youtuber use
this concealer in a tutorial i watch a
lot of youtubers and I love watch a lot
of makeup videos on a daily basis and I
have never ever seen them use this and
it's actually that good I see a lot of
people like this is the cover it
currently is going to show you it's
super thick not cakey not cakey um but
to be honest I don't know why this
concealer isn't spoken about is it hard
to get I don't think it's hard to get
till I got in price plan but I see a lot
of people talk about the anti aid rewind
and the fit me concealer but honestly I
feel like that is literally on the
standard anti age rewind it's a little
bit less cakey not that it's taking
about anti age rewind is a little bit
cakey but that is not cakey whatsoever
okay so the next thing I want to talk
about is they're both actually from the
same brand this
is from Physicians Formula this is the
butter bronzer and this is the
highlighter in translucent pearl so let
me just do it for upstairs so this is
the highlighter here it looks better on
the skin it looks better on the skin I'm
going to add some on top of whatever
I've got on here okay that wasn't as
effective as I thought it would be but
honestly if you're looking for a good at
drugstore on top this is your go-to and
the other thing is the butter bronzer
this blends so well I could probably
compare it runs up through the Marc
Jacobs or Omega tantrik bronzer the only
thing that's a little bit different
about it is this smell and the color is
it's a little bit more closed a
cool-toned and the Marc Jacobs is a
little bit more warm tone and like
orangey sort of thing and this is also
available in that price line as well
which is good because it's available for
all Australians if you're overseas I'm
not sure if you can actually get
decisions formula overseas but I know
it's definitely in Australia you know
the next thing I want to talk about is
this NYC which stands for New York color
I just automatic City don't know why
this is the liquid liner and it is just
let me show you home okay so first of
all I want to talk about the applicator
for it and you can flick it up like this
and it stays a fine point so you can
make this a super super super fine point
which is what I really like about it and
to be honest don't ask me why I don't
using in videos because when I'm not
filming a video I always use it off
camera the last thing I want to talk
about today is the press pigments from
morphe so you guys have probably seen me
use these before I don't see any other
youtubers talk about them why I don't
know I probably seen three and Max and I
watch a lot of youtubers basically when
you touch the pigment it is wet I feel
like I need a production team right here
to like zoom in up on my hand but I'm
not that bougie so basically they are
just I mean like what do you mean are
you saying that that was like one well
the next one I've got here is cold room
service it's like a green so pigmented
like are you kidding
let me swatch another one this one here
is called Gossip Girl G URL hun
this is like a burgundy sort of color
amazing I'm not sure how much they are
because they were actually sent to me in
PR from morphe because I'm
enough to be on their pilot so I get all
their new releases but honestly they're
that good they are that good you touch
it and it's like water it's like wet and
it blends like a dream anyway guys this
is the end of today's video I really
hope you two enjoy it I hope you guys
learned about some of new products that
you want to try out today because I need
to start using these a lot more because
I know there is a lot of underrated
makeup products in here that I need to
pull out and start using more different
ones off I love you guys so much and I
would see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
