today I wanted to address something
today I'm going to be talking about
glitter injections and all the
behind it now the main reason why I'm
making this video is because every
single cover tend to use a glitter
injections in my tutorials or an
Instagram I always always always get
comments why do you use them as they
grow bolder yeah so I dug down or the
deep dark when to find out some
information and as found out as much as
I possibly could
so basically glitter injections was one
of the first companies to ever make
pressed glitters then all these other
companies saw it and then they all
started doing it so from what I know
glitter injections made like 30
different pressed glitters okay and they
used and I think five or six of them
were non solvent resistant now I'm not a
hundred percent sure what that means but
those six that were non solid resistant
that is where the glitter was breaking
down it wasn't molding but it was
breaking down in creating like jello
spots which is like the Galilee sort of
color saw wasn't well but come on guys
like if you know what mold looks like
it's like very like green disgusting
stuff like this was just a little tiny
bit discolored because it was breaking
down so I do have a few glitter
injections pressed glitters here I've
had these for quite some time now had no
problems with them at all so when you
make cosmetic stuff that involves
glitter basically when it's like making
liquid lipstick formulas like you've got
to change ingredients to get brighter
colors and whatnot so in the brighter
colors that they were using that's when
they couldn't use the solvent or
something I don't really know how that
all works like that some more technical
part of it so basically all these other
companies that are making press glitters
now have no problems with their glitters
breaking down because they learn from
the mistake that glitter injections have
first made and apparently if you go onto
their website or if you google if you've
had this problem apparently you just
contact their customer service and they
give you refunds or replacements so if
you've ever got glitter injections like
they've actually just continued those
five or six colors I'm pretty sure like
they haven't made them again in their
working or new ones
then Instagram beyond the day or
something so yeah basically these are
the pressed glitters I'll just swatch
something for you so as you can see
there are through past super highly
pigmented and they don't actually need
glue to stick to the skin but sometimes
I like to use glue
especially if I'm using this on a client
I'll just use glue just to be sure of it
and if you actually like Google glitter
injections mold and it comes out with
photos of the glitters that were
apparently moldy if you have a look at
that it doesn't look like mold
it does not look like well at all we all
make our mistakes we all learn from our
mistakes and as far as I know this one
has been solved no pun intended solvent
so yeah I really just wanted to make a
short little quick dedicated video on
this like I did about the divi event
aftershave balm just because I make
getting a lot of comments about glitter
injections and I just wanted to give my
advice and what I've seen on the
internet about this situation I don't
want to turn this like for gossipy like
channel like this is like a hate video
or anything on glitter injections I also
just voice my opinion on this because I
do get a lot of comments about it I know
this was a really short and sweet video
but if you guys did enjoy this don't
forget to give me a thumbs up if you're
new here subscribe I love you guys so
much and I'll see you in my next video
bye screw
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
