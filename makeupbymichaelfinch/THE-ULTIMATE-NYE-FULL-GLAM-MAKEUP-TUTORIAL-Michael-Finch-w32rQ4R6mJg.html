today I'm gonna be doing a voiceover
because someone who's drilling through
my apartment hence the face and hence
why I'm pissed off well let's get
straight into it
sorry I'm just gonna be taking at my
benefit browsing in the shade at number
three and just filling in my brows and
adding on a bit of a tail kind of
extending them as per usual gel and yes
I'm just making that right there I have
done a voiceover in so long so please
bear with me and then I'm just taking
the powder side and just setting
everything on that and then I'll be
coming in with the benefit gimme brow in
the shade number three and just going
over all of my blond hairs and just
setting everything into place where they
stay all day every day now going in with
the none other touch shape tape
obviously this isn't a shader light
medium honey and I'm just gonna be
concealing underneath my brows and I'm
soon gonna be putting that all over my
lid to use as a base today and instead
of using a Beauty Blender to blend it
out I've actually started using this
little brush from Kat Von D because I
feel like the Beauty Blender soaks off
quite a bit of product compared to this
brush sorry I've been using this brush
quite a lot and I'm kind of obsessed
with using it for my eyes my base and
then I just go in and set it with some
makeup prefer a varnish powder you can
use any party one I just prefer to use
like a press foundation or something
like that and now we are gonna be using
the morphe at jaclyn hill palette i love
this palette
sorry much it is lit it is
 lit for the tick click yes ha
sorry I'm just taking this brown color
and just popping it through my crease
and just blending it up the Brent the
blending brush I'm using is one from
Shannon XO Beauty I don't think she
makes this style of brushes anymore but
they're so good
highly recommend them and then I'm going
in with this dark orange sort of shade
on a smaller brush and then I'm just
defining and adding color now because
this is a race I'm focusing
everything up a lot higher on my eye
especially because I do have a hooded
eye you still want to see it when you do
the cut crease and everything like that
so you still want to have like all the
colors being able to be seen when your
eyes are open and closed so that's why
I'm bringing everything up a little bit
higher and you'll especially see with
the blacks that I'm about to put down
that I bring that up really quite high
just so you can see everything you guys
know what I'm saying you guys get the
gist I'm just taking my big blending
brush and blending absolutely everything
together and now we're going with the
black as I said before so yeah I'm just
going up higher than I normally would
and just popping that all through my
craze hon sorry my close yeah I'm just
dragging that all the way into my inner
corner now the reason I like to drag
those dark colors when I do a cut crease
all the way into my inner corner is
because when you do that lid color it
makes the lip color the contrast between
the two of the crease I shadow colors
and the lid color it makes the lid color
pop so much more so the darker you have
you know your crease color and your eye
shadow on the inner corner when you pop
that lip color on right next to it cuz
it goes up right next to it it's gonna
pop so much more and look so much more
fun and more like a cut crease so that's
why I like to bring it all the way in to
my inner corner and now I'm just gonna
be taking the Todd shape tape again and
this is where we're gonna cut the crease
so I'm just gonna apply a little bit to
my lid and then look straight up and
then that's just gonna create the line
of where my crease is going to be
because I don't want this to transfer so
that's what I like to do and I just kind
of use that line as a guideline I guess
and then I just fill it all in with the
concealer and I'm actually gonna be kind
of like you can see on the other eye
here I'm gonna be winging it out today
rather than just like stopping it and
blending it in like keeping it I'm gonna
like wing it out pretty much and I will
be doing a wing also as you can probably
tell from the thumbnail um so yeah I'm
just focusing on getting that nice and
crisp it doesn't have to be perfect near
like the top part that I'm fixing up now
it doesn't have to be perfect just
because the glitter is gonna cover
majority of it anyway but I just like to
have it nice and clean looking it just
makes me feel better about myself
so yeah hey what Oh and then we're just
setting that concealer with lack of
white eyeshadow from the morphe palette
just the new color one now I'm gonna be
going in with the lit cosmetics a
glitter base and I'm just gonna be using
this on a really small definer brush
we're just gonna Spade this part out
because no one wants to see me apply
glue it's like applying this car day one
so if I can sit there and watch that Wow
I'm letting so much Wow
anyway sir I'm just taking the Helen II
glitter glue sorry Lisa now this was
given to me by makeup by jaw at my
sitting masterclass shirt because she
was doing my makeup for it and I didn't
realize but I left my gold glitter in my
back at the apartment with Lilly sorry
she ended up blending this to me and she
said I can just have it and it's
honestly one of the best gold glitters
that I've ever learned it's not yellow
turns like the Mac on that I was gonna
use so I really prefer this over the Mac
one sorry this is my new fave gold let
us shout out to jaw we're already going
with the wing and this is the wing that
I'll be doing today now we're doing
wings unlike in our gel liner in liquid
liner a little it can be kind of hard
and frustrating but honestly I just try
and make it look as best as I possibly
can and then I just go from there I mean
I would apply the glitter afterwards but
 that because it'd just be like such
a mess in my opinion haven't tried it so
I should actually before I dodged it but
yeah that's the way that we're working
with good there and then I just put some
to face better than dick mascara on one
and yeah I'm just putting that on my
lashes boring boring boring and
everybody actually cares now moving on
to both lashes these are some new ones
from morphe this is in the style go on
and fake it and I know it's half hanging
off my I am aware I was having a
last day that day Bob we're just gonna
move on to face as per usual now this is
the first time using this Charlotte
Tilbury
magic cream but I'm just gonna apply
that all over my face it kind of felt
like feel mmm oyster eyes like it's very
very thick but I felt like it was kind
of tacky sir it was doing something I
don't know if it's used as a primer or a
moisturizer either way I just used it
because it's been sitting in my to use
for so long foundation we're gonna be
using the new and NARS one this is the
long wear effortless foundation it's
easily become one of my new favorite
foundations this is in this shade Yukon
which is perfect for my skin tone in one
of my last videos that actually mixed
with another color because I thought it
was gonna be too dark but it's actually
perfect so if you have my skin turn the
style you con would be perfect for you
it's just like soar high coverage like
it's not even cooled like a high
coverage foundation but it's such high
coverage it's so good and you can
actually layer it and layer and layer it
up and it doesn't get like thick or
cakey or anything like that and it's got
like a nice glow to it as well which I
really do like now I'm just going with a
little bit of the Tarte shape tape
concealer and I'm gonna be doing a
little bit of cream contouring I feel
like now that I've done this a few times
I feel like I'm gonna be doing it every
single tutorial because it just adds
sorry much to the look and I like warms
up your face more like your powders that
you put over the top they blend better I
feel like when you contour when you
bronze I feel like it blends better if
it's already got that base sitting down
there for you so yeah I'm just gonna go
to town on up my cheekbones my jaw my
forehead and my big jelly looking ass
forehead okay so I'm just going around
my jaw I'm adding a little bit extra to
my jaw because I like to really define
it and make it look a little bit more
like this actually a jaw line there
rather than just having a line there and
also my forehead obviously I don't put
as much on my forehead as I do my cheeks
in my jaw line just because I do get a
little bit sweaty on my forehead and it
tends to like go a little bit patchy so
I like to just you know turn it down a
little bit on the forehead then we're
going in with the top shape tape can
seal that I'm going with two different
shades light/medium honey and light I
believe it's called just because
light/medium honey was a little bit too
dark for my foundation today so I just
wanted to keep it nice and bright on my
under eyes and my t-zone area and then
I'm just blending that out with my booty
looking and Belinda as per usual oh yeah
definitely using the Beauty Blender
we're about wow I'm so exhausted right
now I'm doing this voice over in editor
this whole video just the night before
it's meant to go up so this is Thursday
night and I'm absolutely exhausted it's
I mean 9:58 p.m. and I literally felt
like I'm about to die not enough then
I'm just blending the control are the
cream contour a little bit into the
sides just kind of merging them together
sort of thing then I'm going in with the
Laura Mercier translucent powder biggest
regret of my life because it's kind of
like yellow undertone and it kind of
like Dokken my under eye area rather
than brightening it I should have used
the Maybelline fit me but I tried to
change it up a little bit but I will not
be using that against my under eyes I
feel like Laura Mercier is really good
to set the face with because it makes it
look super super smooth and stuff as I'm
doing now but for the under eyes it just
doesn't make the cut for me so I'm not
gonna be making that mistake again okay
so now just going onto my under eyes I'm
just taking the essence long-lasting eye
pencil this is really good at super
creamy and you can start with like a
black eye shadow and it does not move
all day and then I'm just taking that
orange shade from the morphe palette
that I use from my eyes previously and
just blending that out and then just
taking a bigger brush and adding some
more and blending it out and then I just
take a little tiny bit of the black
eyeshadow from the morphe palette and I
just run over that black eyeliner that I
put down before just to set everything
into place and then blend it all
together
hey and then I'm just dusting off that
Laura Mercier powder from underneath my
eyes then we're going to contour am I
gonna love this contour so much it's the
top pocket of princess contour powder a
lot of people don't like this and they
feel like it makes them look money but
it is like so good and it's very
buildable and to me like on me it
doesn't grow muddy at all it doesn't go
money like to me it just looks so nice
on the skin and it blends so well it's
probably one of my all-time favorite
contours there's like dye and then
there's the haller from benefit and then
there's a few other things I can't think
of them off the top of my head I'm so
tired
it's very tired uh-huh and then I'm just
wandering my nose a little tiny bit I do
have a fully dedicated video on that to
search other areas in my channel and it
will pop up it's very old I should doing
you on hey maybe I'll do one in the New
Year good idea now to just bronze that
means to get a little bit more I'm just
gonna be taking the Tom Ford bronzing
powder this
shade golddust I don't really use this
much probably because it was left at one
of my friends houses in Melbourne for
about six months but um you know it's
not the greatest brands are foot buggy
and me know being the price that it is
but yeah changing things up giving it a
well that's what nicely skinned their
butts not very pigmented anyway I'm just
baking underneath my contour a little
bit just with that Laura Mercier powder
actually know it maybe that was the may
but no that was the Maybelline fit me
powder was it I'm sure
well I'm doing so well aren't I now
anyway I'm moving on to my favorite part
highlighter this is our physical our
goals holy you guys this
easily is my new favorite shade of
highlighter from over at the moment it's
just sorrow nice on my skin tone it's
not too white and it's not true like
yellow tone but it's just perfect for my
skin tone so once again if you do have
my skin tone glow goals would be perfect
for you like it's so buildable I know I
do have quite a bit of texture on my
cheek area here where I do put
highlighter on but I'd rather have like
texture highlighter then like I really
like Shia highlight do you know what I
mean so I'm not too fussed on that I
know some of you have to point it out in
the comments before and I am aware of it
but I just keep doing it because on so
you just don't care about the texture
you can just face gene that smooth
it out detail patch what not move on so
I just put that highlight under my brow
bone and on my inner corners and now
we're gonna be moving on to the lips I'm
using one of my old faves this is the
true face pull girl liquid lipstick so
I'm just popping that all over my
biggest sausage Frankfort lookin ass
clown Kylie Jenner lip has challenged
looking lips
chris is here that's why I'm talking
like that but I'm just applying that all
over my lids and then I'm just taking a
little bit of the same lipstick in the
shade
Ali's chic and I'm popping that on the
middle of my lips kind of just to give
like an ombre sort of effect and I'm
just blending it out with a little brush
you can use your finger but I just chose
to use a little brush because of what
acrylics on and that would just be a
 show waiting to happen
but I love the combo of these two
together it's such a nice like pretty
nude like ombre sort of thing so we are
pretty much done I'm just gonna set with
the Too Faced hangover setting spray and
we are done I hope you
guys really enjoyed this video this is
the final look
I love
you guys so much and I would see only my
next video see ya see ya
I'll see you times two Hey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
