channel so today I'm gonna be doing a
big fuck-off Q&amp;amp;A so I asked you guys on
my Twitter to ask me some juicy
questions not just a regular question so
I've got so many I haven't really looked
at them yet but we have a lot of replies
okay and they're pretty hectic so let's
get into it
all right so the first one we've got is
eat ten bags of shit or walk in public
naked I would probably rather eat ten
bags of shit to be honest if I was super
happy with my body and I would do that
but I would honestly rather eat shit
have you ever had a girlfriend or had a
crush on a girl or have you always known
you a gay okay so I think I've explained
this in another video ages ago but in
case you don't know how quickly fill you
in when I was younger I was probably 12
years old 12 not 12
fuck I don't know how all it was
probably like 14 or 15 and I had a
girlfriend and it only lasted like a few
days um maybe she was just like oh this
guy's a fag like do you know what I mean
but I remember I kissed her on the lips
and I had this feeling that I never
thought before it was really weird but
then ever since that it was just like
see ya into the dick bye are you a top
or a bottom I'm bars for those who are
so curious to know because I've got this
question like a hundred times in here
you're a top or a bottom I'm Boris and
if you don't know what that is maybe
google it because I'm not going to
explain it
what's one unpopular opinion that you
have now I don't really talk about this
stuff on my channel much because I know
it's very controversial and I think it's
too controversial and stuff like this
but honest to god I'm a huge believer in
I don't even want to say because I know
people are gonna judge me but like I'm
just so aware of everything that's going
on around me like meaning um the
government and how they're controlled by
them and like I don't want to talk too
much about it because people are gonna
think I'm batshit crazy but if you know
what I'm talking about like how the
government sets shit up and how like I
can't even watch the news I can't watch
the news I don't believe anything I read
because majority of it's bullshit and
majority of it's set up like I could get
into detail but seriously people would
just be like you're a fucking you're
actually insane and you need help do you
know what I mean but yeah I'm a strong
believer in
I'm a strong believer in the Illuminati
just putting it out there
rock on would you hook up with Shaunie
for a dad fuck
no ha ha oh my god I really like this
one if you were straight who would you
bang out of the girls in your group
slash squad probably sky I think she's
so hot and so attractive and she just
looks like a fucking Barbie doll what's
your least favorite place that you've
traveled to um I didn't really like Bali
it was just very humid and I got sick so
I probably wouldn't go back yeah
probably Bali
what is the most bougie-ass thing that
you've ever purchased okay guys so if
you follow me on Instagram and YouTube
obviously if you're watching this you
probably are I love my materialistic
things and that does not mean that I am
a person that is an uptight stuck-up
asshole it just means I like bougie
things and I like to spend my money on
bougie things if I it's my money that I
do what I want with it like no one can
tell me to do different probably the
most busiest thing I've ever bought is
this Cartier ring here this was oh my
god I don't remember how much it was let
me get the receipt another thing about
buying bougie things as I love the whole
process of it like you have to kind of
like go down you can get champagne you
like sit down they offer you a drink or
something to eat no they don't they just
offer you a drink but I love the whole
process of like sitting down and buying
something it's like really rewarding the
only thing that I don't like sometimes
about buying stuff in designer stores is
that I remember when I did buy this ring
they are bought out I don't know I don't
know i I've never had it done like this
before
but they bought the Rings out like all
the sizes in a plastic container with
literally like probably like 200 rings
in there just all in little plastic
pockets and I feel like it just D values
them and you just like oh is that what
it is like it just I don't know I feel
like it just should be that way anyway I
found the receipt for the Cartier ring
and this is the receipt thing you get
it's like a full-on Harry Potter looking
ring like it's so but Harry Potter
looking ring Harry Potter looking
certificate thing it's like stamped and
shit like that
see this was three thousand three
hundred and twenty dollars now don't
think cuz I bought that I go and spend
that amount of money all the time
because I daren't I only get like little
materialistic things here and there
because I love my Gucci and my goal is a
Cartier bracelet which I will get one
day when I've bought a car what's the
type of guy that you're looking for PS
love you so much love you too Chloe I'm
the type of guy I'm looking for is one
that I don't have to message first all
the time to like hang out or something
like that so yeah do you know what I
mean I'm not gonna get into it oh my god
someone said most dicks you've had in
the day oh one huh have you ever fucked
a straight guy see ya
oh my god there's some I'm not gonna
answer but someone literally right when
you were having sex with a guy do you
like it when he comes in your ass
that's the traumatic do you own slash
drive a car I don't actually have a car
at the moment I'm saving up for one I
really want a g-wagen because I think
that's so cute so that's my dream car
whether I'll get it soon or not ha nas
what is the weirdest thing that you've
ever been told during sex okay um the
weirdest thing that I've ever been told
during sex was I don't even want to say
it out loud but I'm just gonna leave it
on the screen right now right here and
let's move on to the next question see
ya how do you afford all these expensive
things and do you have a sugar daddy
okay so you guys probably have realized
that I don't like spending my money on
like cars know that I could fucking get
a car yet but like I don't like spending
my money on cars
I don't really save money much to be
honest I just go out and like eboshit
because it brings me joy and I remember
when I was younger I used to go into
eBay and I would buy fake Louie's fake
Gucci things and I would still love that
but like I just think it's crazy how
back then I had to buy thanks but now I
can actually buy the real thing it makes
me like wow like you've grown as a
person do you know what I mean some
people hate when I buy like Gucci and
Louis and stuff like that and I put on
my social media but like why hey
appreciate do you not I mean do you have
a boyfriend and are you seeing someone
I guess you could say so I guess you
could say so and the last question for
today is what would you do if you
started dating someone who wasn't on
social media /youtube but they started
after you started dating by the way love
you love you too I guess I feel really
weird about it I guess I'd feel so weird
about it because I don't know that just
would be so hectic cuz that would just
make me question are they only dating me
to gain a following
I'd have to actually be in that
situation to be able to say what I would
do because I don't know what I would be
feeling do you know what I mean anyway
guys that's all I have time for today I
hope you somewhat enjoyed this Q&amp;amp;A and
enjoyed me talking a bunch of shit about
myself just remember I love you guys so
much and I will see you all in my next
video fucking see ya
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
