channel so today I'm gonna be doing aq a
I asked you guys on Twitter any
questions that you want me to answer now
I'm gonna be answering once they're a
little bit more juicy then normal search
strap yourselves in dull and let's get
straight into it shall we
by the way I'm wearing mine and Chinese
merch it says not a problem on SG the
label comm I will leave the link down
below if you weren't interested in
purchasing okay so I'm just going over
to my Twitter right now if you guys
don't follow me on Twitter what are you
doing with your life now I'm kidding I
don't really personal know much but if
you want to chop to me Twitter's like
the best way to do it sure I'm just
gonna be talking about like things that
I've been wanting to answer for quite a
while but I just haven't really spoken
about so the first question I've got is
from Aussie dash doll and she says how
did you first get motivated to start
losing weight and what kind of things
did you do at the very beginning so the
way that I got motivated to start losing
weight was I saw photos that other
people had taken like whoops off me or
with me and I was just like oh my god
like something needs to change about
this like I can't I can't change the
photos or other people taking me I need
to change this so that's pretty much was
just like when I was like I can't even
start losing weight and going to the gym
but in saying that I have been off track
for like since I went to Bali and I've
got Coachella coming up and then I've
got grace and like all these different
holidays and just like it's so hard to
like diet when you're on holidays cuz
you just want to drink and eat good food
and stuff like that so hopefully I can
get back into it soon I'm just kind of
making good decisions at the moment not
really I've been eating ice cream like
every single night before I go to bed
but like yeah it's just like it's a mind
thing like you have to be in the right
mindset to be able to stick to it and
lose weight I will get back on track
soon I just don't know when I've just
got so much to do I'm not the last
thing I'm thinking about is losing
weight at the moment but I will get back
on track soon because I really do enjoy
I drew enjoy going to the gym and making
my arms look rather oh that does crap oh
my god someone asked me have you ever
had a little crush on Jonathan are you
serious
Shaunie's like my best friend is I mean
I think Jonathan is stunning in all that
but I've never had a crush on him that's
that's that to that that this question
was asked sorry much in this whole
Twitter thing its how did you feel as
Shaunie's best friend about John and her
getting back together love them both
just curious um I'm happy for them both
I think they're super cute together I
love John and I love Shaunie and I think
they're gonna make really cute baby one
day
sorry do you have any youtube beef hmm I
actually don't I really try to avoid
getting into drama and stuff I try and
keep like a really clean slate because
the last thing I want to do is get into
YouTube beef with anyone so ya know I
don't honestly like I really don't I
don't have beef with anyone on YouTube
there is a few people that I don't like
just because of things that they've done
and just like you know in direct waiting
and whatnot but let's not get into that
because it's really none of my business
the next question is what G hated that
being a youtuber okay sir guys I get
asked this literally all the time and I
love being a YouTube okay first of all I
love YouTube so much
it is everything tomatoes my job it is
my life it is what I live and breathe
for however there are a few negative
things that do come along with it so
I've thought of a few things that I just
want to fire so the first thing is when
I'm meeting people out in public I love
it I love meeting you guys and you guys
enjoy that I love taking photos with you
it's really cool and still a little bit
crazy in my mind anyway um sometimes
when people ask for a photo with you
they don't do it in a very polite way
for example I'd be out somewhere doing
something and someone would just come up
to me and say can we get a photo it's
like hi what's your name nice to meet
you blah blah blah like what would be so
much nicer is hi there my name's
Isabella I really enjoy your videos am I
able to get a photo with you sure why
not
but when it's just like can we get a
photo or especially like if we're out
clubbing oh my god you know the thing
that grinds my gears the most is when
I'm with friends and someone asked me
for a photo and they literally just grab
their phone and they just push it into
my friends face
meaning like take the fart or like that
is one thing that really hurts
me or like when people do that I'm just
like no no no let's do a selfie like it
just gets annoying like it just gets so
annoying for my friends to having like
they don't mind doing it because they're
all super nice but like it just gets
annoying like like if I was them I would
be annoyed you know what I mean like I
wouldn't want to take photos of my
friend with subscribers or night or
whatever like that you know what I mean
the other thing that pisses me off is if
we're all out as a group or I'm just
with like some of my other friends or
whatnot and people have physically like
pushed my friends out of the way like
they've literally shoved them and said
can you get the out of the way like
people push them out of the way to get
to me like thanks I know that's kind of
like riveting but like no I'm kidding
I'm kidding
but I feel like it's so rude when people
push my friends it's the worst thing
ever and I've always said something I'm
like why did you have to push my friend
like it's just so unnecessary for people
to just like push and shove my friends
out of the way or just like get in their
face to move like it happens so often
and it's just so annoying please just be
polite oh my god another thing that I
don't like about being a youtuber is
haters now I'm not talking about haters
that are like Gareth Haag I'm
talking about haters
it's my microphone recording I'm not
talking about those haters that like
 online I'm talking about the
ones that actually try and make him move
on physically seeing me in person in
order to do something so let me tell you
a little story time tilt I'm not gonna
give this guy any credence whatsoever
because he's already embarrassed himself
enough on the Internet
he pretty much makes videos about me and
says that he wants to like egg me or
like he's extremely homophobic and he's
not down for me whatsoever like I don't
know why he doesn't like he has such
like a vulgar like hate campaign against
me with him and all of his friends yeah
he's made numerous videos about me on
one of these social media platforms and
I always get sent him and I just laugh
at them I'm like whatever but um when I
did be Sydney made up with Shaunie
um he was threatening to come along and
fry eggs at me
I know pathetic right like think of
something about a hon anyway I was like
I don't want to get eggs like my makeup
is gonna look lit like if I get eggs
thrown at me then everything's just
gonna turn to like what am I gonna
do so I was like this so I hit up
benefit and princess probably I'm like
we need extra security I want security
guards like here and here and they sent
me this full plan of all their security
cuz benefit and princess probably the
best people to work with Allah so that
had the best tightest security that
whole day it was so good literally from
like when we got out of the car to like
at the venue the whole time like going
to the bathroom and everything it was
just so good yeah they kind of
like rocked up towards the end I'm
pretty sure they were at the back but
there was no way in how that they could
get anywhere near me so good luck but
you failed maybe next time Jill OH oh
sorry another thing that I don't like
about being a youtuber is when I'm in a
shopping center or something and people
follow me around like that gives me the
worst anxiety like when people like
physically follow you from shop to shop
like filming you or something like that
it's just like I understand like it's
maybe they don't have like the
confidence to come up and say hello
which is totally understandable but just
like when you know like people are
filming you and following you around
constantly it's just like it just gives
me so much anxiety like I'd much rather
people just come up and say hey give me
a hug have a chat go get a coffee
whatever do you know what I mean okay
another question I get asked a lot is
how do you cart with anxiety okay so
anxiety is kind of bought onto me by or
even thinking so I tend to overthink a
lot and it's with everything like sorry
many situations like relationships
friends like everything like that like I
am such an over-thinker
I tend to kind of create a problem
sometimes so literally what I did last
week is I googled like I was considering
like this is a little bit dramatic but I
was considering going to see a counselor
just to talk to someone that like
doesn't really know me just to get their
advice and like what they could say to
help me in a way do you know what I mean
anyway I literally just ended up going
on
and googled how to stop overthinking cuz
that's my main problem that's what
brings on my anxiety about things and
stuff like that and I read them and I
was like holy this is actually
genius so pretty much what I've learned
to start doing is not investigating and
investing so much time in things and
overthinking as much as I normally do as
I said
that is why my anxiety gets triggered so
what I've learnt to do is if I'm like
starting to overthink or if I'm like in
a deep mindset of just overthinking
something and I know it's gonna give me
anxiety what I do is I just stop there
and I literally just like think of
something else like I know it sounds so
hard because it's always playing in the
back of your mind but I've just thought
everything is good at the moment why
would I try and create a problem or
overthink something too that might cause
me to create a problem does that make
sense
it's really complicated like not like a
professional or anything like this but
that's what I've been doing as of late
and it's actually really been helping a
lot so yeah here's a really good one
that I know exactly how I'm gonna answer
how has filler and cosmetic enhancements
impacted your self-esteem and is there
anything else you'd like to get done
when I was in primary school people used
to always call me out for having a big
nose now the way the reason why I get my
lips done so big or I make them bigger
in photos is because the bigger my lips
are the more proportion is at my face
meaning it makes my nose look smaller so
when I used to have super super super
small lips just like no lip filler my
nose used to look huge but in my opinion
the bigger my lips looked or smaller my
nose looks so that's kind of like where
it comes in I haven't really said that
before because it kind of sounds dumb
but honestly that's what it is
is there anything else that I would like
to get done I mean uh Turin or like a
while ago I was like yeah I want to get
this done this done this done this done
this done but I don't know like I'm
always changing my mind about things
like I don't know if I want to get a
nurse job I want a Brazilian butt lift
I need a breast reduction I need a
full-body lipo like I don't know what I
want to hunt there's a lot that I want
done but I just turned have the guts to
do
because I hate hospitals and
surgery and pain and recovery time lag I
want to constantly be on the go doing
 I don't want to be bedridden for
six weeks with a fake ass well I
do but I don't you know what I mean the
next question is what is your worst
experience out clubbing oh my god you
guys I have the most perfect one to tell
you okay so you know a while ago when I
first moved to Brisbane and I uploaded a
vlog and at the end of the vlog I said I
got food poisoning went home and started
vomiting all over myself because that
ate Twiggy sticks does anyone remember
that if you remember that like if you
come back that far with me let me know
down below cuz that's so funny
if you do anyway so I pretty much just
had platters at my house when I'd first
was moved to Brisbane me and all my
friends were going out clubbing and I
ate Twiggy sticks anyway so we went out
clubbing and then I got into a domestic
with one of this friend guy thing
disgusting human that I was seeing and
we got into a fight and I decided to
come home because you know when you get
into a fight with someone it just
completely ruins you know you just want
to leave like that's all you want to do
like you can't have fun unless you like
makeup which you never really do when
you're not covering because you're drunk
couldn't just like whatever anyway I
decided to come harm and as soon as I
got home I'm not kidding five minutes
after I was sitting on the toilet
 myself vomiting all over myself
sweating profusely but it's like it was
like a cold sweat like a fucked-up sweat
like a weird sweat like hot but cold
does that make I don't know and I was
like oh my god I have food poisoning now
that's what I thought
until the other day when my stepsister
was down and she's a nurse and we were
talking about this situation she's like
that doesn't sound like food poisoning
that sounds like you got spiked
and I was like oh my god it does
like that makes so much sense because
normally through poisoning kind of
builds up over time it doesn't just hit
you like a ton of bricks straight away
do you know what I mean like I was fine
until I got home five minutes then I was
just vomiting gagging sweating
everywhere what makes it even more
obvious that I'm most likely ninety nine
percent point nine was bite was
everybody else ate the Twinkies
and didn't get sick so I'm pretty sure I
got spiked that night and I would love
to go back to that day get the security
footage and see if someone slipped
something in my drink
holy because if they did I would
 them up in court
I would them up with legal fees I
would their whole life and their
whole family up and they would not be
able to do anything ever again
it would make so much more sense because
I was so sick like I was sorry I
don't remember like anything sorry yeah
I can come as spikes rock on Joel just
just a little wet of advice always watch
your drinks don't take your eyes off
your drinks and bar because there's some
sick people in this world that want to
try and kill you literally and the last
question I'm gonna answer for today is
give us your tea on the tenner merger
and vidcon beef okay
I think VidCon is for doing what
they did to her if you don't know what
happened go watch Tanner's video on it I
just think it's and like the fact
that like other people are coming out
saying their experiences with VidCon and
how they were comes to them says a
lot about VidCon so I was actually
invited to go to VidCon this year but
I'm actually not gonna go anymore
because as the things that I've had
anyway this brings us to the end of
today's video yet again till I hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you did make
sure you give it a massive thumbs up I
love you guys sorry much and I
will see you all in my next video
