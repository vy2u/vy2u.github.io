channel so today I'm gonna be doing my
top 10 favorite foundations of all time
I'm gonna be doing five drugstore and
five high-end so without any further ado
let's get straight into this video
so I'm constantly switching up my
foundations and finding new ones because
a lot of brands are coming out with new
ones I used to be obsessed with the Marc
Jacobs remarkable foundation but it's
just too cakey for me to use now and
there's more foundations that have come
out over the time since that ever came
out that are a lot thinner that are
still really full-coverage and they
don't feel as cakey and they're not as
hard to work with so the first one I
want to talk about today is the Lancome
T an adult ultra wear foundation this is
in the shade 215 buff neutral this
honestly the coverage what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna give you guys swatches on
my hand I know that's what on my face
but like it's still pretty good so I
just put one pump on there and I'm just
going to swirl this around and show you
and it smells are really really good too
the reason why I like this so much is
because it's a buildable you can build
it up and it doesn't get cakey so the
coverage is super super buildable and I
love to mix it with the Georgia or money
power fabric foundation as well so
that's like one of my favorite combos
ever but if you're after a full coverage
high-end foundation which I'm showing
you all of these are pretty much full
coverage high and foundations I'm just
gonna give you guys a few options this
is definitely one of them that I love I
know you can buy Lancome in Australia
which is good you can get it in store so
you can go and test out your shade and
stuff like that the second high-end
foundation that I want to talk about
today is the power fabric along where
high cover foundation this is in the
shade 3.5 this is perfect for my skin
tone literally perfect so if you have my
skin tone and you lack that pinky
undertone to it then 3.5 in the power
fabric would be your shade this is just
so good to mix in with other foundations
I love mixing my foundations together
it's not very like good to do it in
videos because I feel like people don't
want to see foundations mix they just
want to see one foundation and see what
it looks like so I attend I try not to
mix them in videos anymore but this is
this one here at once again this one is
so full coverage super buildable and it
feels like you're wearing at nothing on
your skin that is the cover is this tube
line can you guys see that I don't know
if these brushes are gonna work on
camera but honestly amazing incredible
no I know you can buy Giorgio Armani in
Sephora in Australia
so it's pretty easy to get there's no
hassles with that one either
the third foundation that I want to talk
about is the Lamar Lamar Lamar the soft
fluid at long-wear foundation now I'm in
the shade of shale once again this is
perfect for my skin tone this is a way
on the pricier side and if you enjoy
spending your money on high and a luxury
makeup then this is definitely good for
you I find this coverage of medium to
full Fe like you do you have to build it
up quite a bit but I love the smell of
it just smells like it smells like Kris
Jenner okay so if you were to smokers
Jenner this is what I would smell like
because it smells like a rich bougie mom
do you know what I mean
I don't really know what else to say but
like it's so full coverage and so this
is once I said as I said medium to full
coverage you can build it up I love
building it up but it is a $200
foundation so I don't know if you want
to spend that much money on foundation I
don't know why I did I went out and
bought it and then Lamar actually
contacted me and sent me three other
shades which is good because it does
leak on planes so if you aren't the
Lumina Foundation and you haven't taken
on a plane before don't because it
literally like explodes out the top and
goes all throughout your makeup case
it's happened three times to me and I
still haven't learnt my lesson the next
foundation I want to talk about is the
huda beauty of faux filter foundation
now this has only just come out I
actually bought the wrong shade of this
and literally about half an hour ago I
just got a package in the mail and hooda
must have seen or who does t must have
seen that I use the wrong shade so they
sent me two new shades the primer and
the brush which is amazing so much
respect for them because after I gave a
 review on the desert dust palette
they're still sending me PR which is
 awesome so shout out to huda
beauty for being awesome anyway this is
in the shade angel food and this is way
too light for me it's literally white
and I think there is true lot of shades
that come than this but once again this
is super full coverage super buildable
like this is full as coverage like
I'm not kidding like so buildable and it
feels like you're wearing nothing on
your skin it feels like you're wearing
nothing on your skin and I love that
inner foundation that's why I've kind of
gone off the Marc Jacobs remarkable
because it feels like you're wearing a
lot of makeup in my opinion so I
tend to steer away from that now but I
still do love it because I did used to
use it on my clients all the time it's a
really good client foundation when they
want really full land you know what I
mean and the last high end foundation
I'm gonna be talking about is the
essential high coverage crane foundation
now this has only just come out as well
I'm actually wearing on my skin right
now this is my first time using it and
honestly I'm obsessed it is so
thin but the coverage is literally
amazing that a little bit goes a long
way this is my newfound love okay so I
just found two new that loves the huda
beauty one and those ua1 they're both
super super good I don't think you can
get you a in stores which sucks you can
only get online and beautybay I think
for my Australians I'm pretty sure
Beauty baseships all worldwide not
sponsored yeah I'm wearing it now and
it's literally the most perfect color
for me this is in the shade shel what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna leave all the
foundations down below with the shade
that I use so if you have a similar skin
tone to me then you can just get that
shade okay guys so now moving on to the
drugstore foundations that are my
all-time face the first one I want to
talk about this is the luminous
hydrating foundation from designer
brands now I got word a long time ago
that designer brands pretty much gets
all the ingredients from all the
high-end brands and puts it into one I
don't know if it's true correct me if
I'm wrong but I am in the shade a light
sand flats and yes it's got like that
pinky undertone to it and oh my god this
foundation literally reminds me of Villa
Mella on like it's that good it's same
coverage and it smells so good too oh my
god
I have only used it a few times but
honestly this is like my guru drugstore
foundation when I need like really good
coverage really buildable coverage and
it gives your skin like a Gloria as well
hence the word luminous in there now I
know you can get this in Australia as
well you can get it in like I think
Terry White chemists may sell it I'm not
too sure if price lines still sell
designer brands but you can get it
around in Australia I don't know if it's
available in America and overseas the
next drugstore foundation I want to talk
about this is the LA girl Pro coverage
foundation
I used to be obsessed with this but then
new foundations come out and I just use
new things this is in the shade fair oh
my god the coverage now I know a Lego
isn't that easy to get here in Australia
I don't think they sell it in any stores
but once again full as coverage
amazing that's what you want you want
that buildable coverage I guess I don't
know what else to say about these
foundation guys because they're all high
coverage they're all buildable they're
all thin on the skin it doesn't feel
like you're wearing a ton of makeup
the next one I want to talk about is the
Milani conceal imperfection one
foundation and concealer I'm in the
shade lat natural this also is very
 good I don't know what else to
say about it it's just so full coverage
you can build it up this is more on the
thicker side so it does feel like you
are wearing a little you know you like
you can definitely feel that it's on
your skin that's probably the only one
out of all the drugstore ones that I'm
gonna be showing you guys today but
honestly so good now the next
foundation I want to talk to you guys
about this is the L'Oreal True Match now
this is very easy to get in Australia
price line all that sort of stuff I'm in
the shade 16 n on a golden ivory I'm in
the shade golden ivory once again I laid
them all down below if you guys are
interested this is just super super
blendable and super buildable you can
build the coverage up and it is probably
the best drugstore foundation that you
can get in Priceline I believe I'm
pretty sure I got this from Priceline
it's good so if you want a good
one and you live in Australia and you
just want to go in store and grab it
then get this because it's good
the last foundation I want to talk about
today this is the wet and wild a photo
focused foundation I'm in the shade
shell ivory I got this one I was in
America this was only eleven US dollars
which is around 15 Australian I'm pretty
sure sorry I was just really interrupted
but um yes this is the shade shell ivory
and it's so buildable
I paid six dollars and 20 cents so it
pretty much adds up to I don't know 10
Australian dollars I'm pretty sure so
the coverage is super buildable and once
again super super thin I don't know if
you guys have seen but I'll leave the
link down below where I use this in a
drugstore video if you guys want to go
check it out so yeah that's
pretty much there's not much else I can
say about these foundations because they
all have high coverage they're all
really thin on the skin and they feel
really really nice anyway I hope you
guys really enjoyed this video if you
did make sure give me a massive thumbs
up I love you guys so much and I will
see you all in my next one
 see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
