channel so today I'm gonna be doing a
full review and testing out all of Kim
K's mute stuff that she has bought out
we have concealer lipstick baking powder
brightening powder and the eye shadow
palette in collaboration with makeup by
Mario this is absolutely stunning and I
seriously hope I like it because I love
the colors in it and I love this blue I
just don't know what look to do I'm like
looking at these and I'm looking at this
time I'm looking at there's I don't know
what to do I really do like a blue
smokey eye I know everyone's been doing
that but I just want to give it a whirl
and say what happens if you enjoyed this
video it makes you give it a thumbs up
and let's get straight into it alright
guys so I'm gonna start off with using
the concealer now the shade that I got
is the shade number three I'm gonna use
this as my eyeshadow base today because
normally when brands come out with like
a concealer and I should I palette they
should work together um so I'm gonna
give this a whirl so it comes in this
little tiny thing that you get you Bob
like that I'm just gonna pop some onto
the back of my hand I'm just gonna take
a flat brush bugging here
and I'm going to so the coverage so far
is lit but I'll be able to tell more
when I drew underneath my eyes okay I'm
just gonna drag the remaining I'm sure
my lid as per usual really lacking this
coverage so far so good just gonna blend
this out with my Beauty Blender no eyes
now rather than going in with a powder
or anything I'm gonna go striking it
with the eyeshadow pallete how much
gonna take this cream palette shade pop
this full or everywhere I put the
concealer see this little red mark on to
hear that concealers covered at the
early concealer that's ever covered that
fully is the tight shape tape so the
coverage on this is so good so far so
good
the first shade I'm gonna go in with is
this brown transition sort of color you
know and I'm gonna start by popping this
to my
see that blended really easy is not much
fallout in the pallet either I want this
to be like a really dark like intense
smoky eye with the blue sorry I'm gonna
be absolutely taking this on oh my
god you guys my battery's literally
about to die and my other ones dead I
need to go and charge these things and
I'll be back just gonna keep unpacking
on this Brown it's blending sorry sorry
Wow sorry well like that's blended out
perfectly
Wow okay so while my camera battery was
charging a little bit more I got a
little bit carried away and did this I
so impressed now let me show you guys
how I did it super super easy super
blendable and super easy to work with
I'm so impressed with this palette so
far so good till so after doing that
brown shade I then went in with this
warmer shade here and I literally
literally Kim you're being so rude I
just went in with this shade on dis
fussy brush and I just started building
it up through my craze and like they
literally pack on like you know when I
should have palettes they don't pack on
to each other the way they should like
they kind of blend away hate
these don't do that thank so these
are like figs oh my god so good
like that's just blended out so well can
you can you say that I'm gonna take that
brush I used before and just blend out
that edge there
okay then I'm gonna take this greater
now this kind of looks like really cool
turning like gray but it actually comes
off kind of black on the eye which I
like so I'm just gonna go ahead pop that
in my out of a like they blend so well
like this is so easy and I'm just gonna
bring that up
through my crease slightly once I've got
that sitting there I'm just gonna go
back in with this brush and a little bit
more of that warm shade tap off the
shipping you don't need tilt and then
I'm gonna just blend over those edges to
make sure it's all nice and seamless as
 I feel like this is gonna be my new
like guard tree palette like I love
changing up my makeup but this is like
very easy like I'm sorry so I'm so
impressed
okay that was super easy to do now going
in with the blue shade I did try on
decide without fix+ and like with all
shimmery shades it just doesn't work
that very well so I'm just going to
lather up my brush with in that blue
color it's so so stunning and I'm just
gonna spray my brush with a little bit
of the macro cannot fix that either and
just go straight up on in here packing
it all over my entire lid literally just
going to town and the color payoff is so
good
okay now I'm just gonna take this brush
again and just kind of slightly blend
over the edges of the blur I'm just
gonna take a little bit of blue on dis
brush here this fluffy brush this blue
kind of blends really nicely as well so
you can like buff it into your mats
which is good it's not like a wet
consistency it's like blendable do you
know what I mean just gonna fix up this
eye a little bit as well bring up that
blue a little bit higher there we go now
in the blending process I did lose some
of the blues so I'm just gonna go pack
more of this right back over the top
cool now spice it a little bit more I'm
just gonna take some of this really
shimmery like white shade and I'm just
gonna pop that in the center of the lid
just to like brighten it up a little bit
I'm kind of just blending the edges
slightly you're gonna need some fix+
there it is then the exact same thing on
the side is popping it in the center
then just taking a little bit more blue
on that same brush just over the outer
edges cool I'm happy with that now I
just I didn't even get that much fallout
which is really good I literally got the
tiniest bit of fallout with all of the
eyeshadows like this is from the whole I
look like there's no fallout whatsoever
on the brown shades or anything so
that's fantastic I'm just gonna quickly
go ahead and do my foundation and then
we can move into the concealer and the
powder and the lipstick and everything
like that
okay sorry foundation is all done for
those who want to know what I used I
just use the Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation and concealer in the shade 5
fair now really want to concealer I'm
gonna be taking the k'kaw concealer in
the shade at number three and I'm going
to go ahead and conceal my t-zone area
first blend that out before I do my
under eye is so true brighten up the
inner part of the face still and I'm
just gonna blend this out with my booty
blender I really really like this
concealer it's actually so nice
holy now this is gonna be the part
where we're gonna find out if this works
well under the eyes so I'm just gonna go
ahead and might just choose that much
like that's a little bit for me don't
here too
why not so I'm gonna go in with my
Beauty Blender
it's like a really light like it feels
like there's nothing going on under my
eyes as though heart-shaped tape is
really like intense and you can
definitely feel it you've got a
on a concealer on but with this it's
like super light and it looks really
good
it covers Wow all right so I'm super
impressed with this can still are so
fast a good till now to bake I'm gonna
be taking the baking powder this is in
the shade number one sorry actually just
gonna add a little bit more under here
just a little bit more coverage on this
look you know super light but it's
really good coverage perfect okay so now
I've got my baking powder ready I
managed to get that seal off with a pair
of tweezers so I've just tipped out a
shit-ton into the lid of this and I'm
just gonna go in with my damp Beauty
Blender and I'm just gonna go ahead and
bake so I'm packing quite a large amount
on because this is meant for baking I'm
also just gonna run it all over my nose
like I always do and my chin Cupid's bow
and then of my forehead as well I'm just
gonna quickly set the rest of my face
with the Australia's fresh and flawless
pressed powder
okay now why I've got that baking powder
under here I wanted you to bottom of my
lives and I literally just want to go in
with that blue and smoke it the
down and then put something in my
waterline rather than doing bronze and
being boring like I always am sorry I'm
literally just gonna take all it's got a
mirror I didn't even realise that
perfect I'm just gonna take it to blue
shade from the palette and I'm just
gonna go in the thing I love about this
blue eyeshadow is it's got a shimmery
part in it but then it's got like a
matte blue in it as well that like
blends out really nicely
taking the next product I'm gonna be
taking the brightening powder okay so
going in with this brightening powder in
the shade at number one I'm just going
to take it on this brush here I'll give
you guys my final thoughts at the end of
the video I'm just going to go ahead and
do everything else on my face and then
we can drill it and then I'll be back
with my final thoughts
okay so lashes and everything is now on
for anyone who's interested I'm gonna be
leaving to pull the products that I used
on my face down below this is a review
on Kim's only that's why I didn't
put everything else in so you guys get
the gist I'll be leaving everything else
down below okay sir moving on to lips we
have three different things the
have no idea what this is oh that's a
gloss okay so the lipstick that I got is
classic kay so it's a nude I'm not gonna
do bleep plan or anything cuz when I do
a lip liner my lips just look
around
Daniela's oh creamy so I really like the
color this was kind of like a warm
you've got warm undertones or night not
sure sure umm anyway that's really nice
it doesn't feel true sticky or anything
like that anyway I'm just gonna go over
the top with the juicy gloss it's like a
peach color okay guys so this brings us
to the end of today's video I'm super
impressed with this eyeshadow palette I
actually love it I love the
lipstick I love the gloss and yeah if
you guys enjoyed this video make sure
you give it a massive thumbs up I love
you guys and I'll see you all in my next
video bye see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
