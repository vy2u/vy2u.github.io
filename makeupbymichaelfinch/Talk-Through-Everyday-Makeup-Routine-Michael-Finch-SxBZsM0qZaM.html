hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm going to be doing it updated
everyday makeup tutorial now I feel like
this is really needed because it's
changed quite a bit all the products
that I use have changed quite a bit by
the way I hope you guys like my new
background and my her you guys can call
me DJ Michael Lilly sorry for my brows
today I'm gonna be using the Anastasia
dip brow pomade in chocolate now I'm
trying to change out my eyebrows I'm
trying to grow them out a little bit
because they are just so skinny so I'm
like rolling it out like under here and
just like making them a little bit
thicker with the hair so hopefully that
works out well in the end oh no I look
like a troll I just kind of draw a line
from the bottom and then just go around
and just like fill it in do not I mean
so basically I just draw a line on the
bottom and then just do it on the top
connect the dots and then just kind of
make a new brush shape so I kind of
pretend that there's no hair there at
all and just make a whole new one which
I feel like it works for me now
basically guys this everyday makeup
tutorial is I don't wear makeup every
single day but when I go to work and
stuff like that like if I have a lot of
clients in one day I will try to wear
makeup if I can be bothered because
normally I get up really early all the
products that I'm using today that's
like what I've reached for when I you
know get up in the morning I just reach
for these specific products and a few of
you requested I updated everyday makeup
tutorials so here it is now what I do
when I get to the front is I kind of
just get the brush it's got no new
products when I add all and I kind of
just push it forward towards like the
front of my eyebrow I don't really know
what I'm saying tbh and then the line
that I've got under here if that's too
harsh I'll kind of just push that up and
blend the product in to the front of my
brow okay so once my other brow is done
then I move on to the skin now the
primer that I reached for every single
time I do my makeup is benefit
Porefessional obviously hello sorry I
just get about that much and just don't
it on my face and then just rub it in so
what's the primers on it then I drew my
skin normally I'll do my eyes first
I feel like when I do like a very
minimal eye makeup I do my skin first
when I spritz my face sometimes I use
fix+ or the setting spray so I can
western art before I apply foundation
but I have been loving this Mario
Badescu skin care rose water aloe vera
herbs sprayed I don't know I got it
from echo it's $10 I only got it because
Kylie Jenner uses with some way why not
so basically what I do is I just close
my eyes and just so once I sprayed all
that on and then we want your foundation
now I'm gonna be moving on to my Holy
Grail foundation because well again so
that is some might turn their nose up
but I love it it's the r-1 perfecting
liquid foundation and I left my other
one in another town so I'm mixing the
shake buff and neutral beige together to
get my skin tone so before I start my
foundation every single time I just get
a tee back so when I do underneath my
eyebrows to conceal them I just grab any
concealer this is the Urban Decay Naked
concealer in the shade fair neutral by
the way all products that I use will be
down below if anyone who's interested
they will be there go check it out I
used to be really lazy an operon below
but now I make sure every single time
that I drew put them down below just
because people generally are interested
so yeah so I just kind of spritz a
little bit of that under both of my
eyebrows and then I get my flat top
brush and kind of just like get as close
as I can to the edge of the brow on top
of my eyebrows I use the foundation
color so it's not highlighting the top
of my eyebrows like little horns okay so
I'm what I just failed to mention is I
just get a little bit more concealer all
over my shirt and just pop a little bit
on I just got that ball in my
eyebrow then I just take my damp Beauty
Blender this is actually a pink Beauty
Blender would you believe it and I just
kind of smudge that down now before that
gets a chance to crease I just go in
with any sort of powder this is just the
Sephora mineral foundation powder and I
just set that because I really don't
want that crease thing because if that
crease is that affects your eyelids your
eyeshadow my dream I am getting sick so
kiss me if my voice sounds up at
any points of this video okay so for
foundation as I said before I'm mixing
buff in neutral beige cheetah bar
I just kind of do like 5050 I just apply
it with a regular foundation brush
because if I go starting with a Beauty
Blender it soaks up too much of the
foundation and then I'm losing all this
product and I don't like that Oh oh my
god I literally just shot myself in the
eye on a stings oh my god that
 stings sorry badly so I got let
it shut myself in the eye with the
foundation and she can stay everything
up um basically what I do is I just
cover my entire face with this brush
sorry with this foundation now I just
get a little bit more foundation on the
Beauty Blender and just start blending
that out
as I said before when I drew the tops on
my eyebrows I just start in with the
foundation and the little flat top brush
that I used earlier so I just go along
the top trying not to interfere with the
actual eyebrow so I just lived my
 Smurfs that out the way and
just start + drink that on once that's
done I just then start blending away my
own hand ok so once that's all blended
out then I move on to concealer I have
been loving the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer it's like not too dry I'm kind
of loving it more than the NARS radiant
creamy concealer I never thought I'd say
that but um there is true faces bringing
up Born This Way concealers so I'm kind
of excited to use them they're not in
Australia or any like a few bloggers
have them and all I do is I do my nose
bridge first cuz I trying to slim that
down a little bit later and my chin the
reason why I don't do my vice first
anymore is because it tends to crease
and it can't set into creases if you're
not careful sorry I do this first blend
it out because this isn't going to
crease so I bring it to about there now
because when you bring it out too far it
can widen your face unless you contro
back down again what I like to do before
I blend that out is either get a fixed
plus or just like any sort of spray and
just and then I just start blending this
out
I start from the bottom first like the
bottom of the can why is there a
eyelash there so I start from the bottom
of the concealer and then blend up
because I feel like I'm gonna be setting
the eyes lost I mean under names like
the closest to my eyes phos lost oh and
what I'm saying so it's kind of
like a rice because I want to bake it
before it like creases now this is kind
of like a rice for time then I get my
car yes bun take them like quite a bit
out into the lid just before I said I
just make sure it's blended and then I
did straight into my 30s fun and kind of
buff it in then to set the rest of my
foundation I just take the Sephora
mineral powder foundation just any big
fluffy brush and just pop that onto the
rest of my foundation so what I do for
my eyeshadow is I literally just
give me Sun by Mac because I need a
little bit of something in there and all
I do is I just buff this into my crease
just so I have like it's something going
on up in there and because this is a
warm color it kind of suits my eye as it
brings them out a little bit so I'm just
getting a bit more of that and buffing
that into the crease area and then I
just plop it onto the lid like I don't
put any other color on the lid I just do
the bronzer now just to do it under my
eyes I'm still using giving me sun and i
just plucked a little bit underneath so
warm up my face i just get a big fluffy
brush like this and starting to give me
some once again and i just kind of warm
up the entire face like I'm not really
contouring with it I just kind of warmed
up this bronzer is so nice it just
usually like that perfect like Sun Sun
Sun quo Sun glow
I don't really contour my nose what I do
every day makeup so I just kind of get
the bronzer and go like this now it's a
contour I'm using hoola by benefit and
I'm not really considering much I'm just
giving my face a little bit of
definition Johnny a little bit down the
side of my nose now a full mask are
today I'm going for my Too Faced better
than sex mascara I still love my benefit
they're real don't get me wrong but I
like to change it up every now and again
I feel like this is a great mascara for
everyday use now for blush today I don't
like to go too overboard with blush but
it's gonna be using nods from orgasm
it's gonna be using orgasm from nas and
this is like a really hot blush to apply
like it's not all that pigmented so you
need to like build it up which is kind
of what you want in a blush because you
can go overboard quickly with a blush
and that's not good but I kind of just
smile I don't know just gonna pick up on
camera because I literally put like a
knot on it's very like shimmer Iike is
kind of like a highlighter in itself so
I like it makes your cheeks glow a
little bit moving on to my lashes I'm
pretty sure these are styled Gigi in
brilliant lashes but I could be wrong so
I'll leave it on the screen now if I am
wrong also it'll be down below
regardless so the last flow that I'm
using today is House of lashes and the
tweezers are a BH
now to apply my highlighter today I'm
using my new favorite highlighter King
Tut from jeffree star cosmetics this is
what it looks like so I don't really
need to put like a fixed plus or on
anything on because it's a so Pete man
egg
I just put on longer tops of my
cheekbones because this highlighter is
so easy to blend I kind of bring it down
onto my actual little thing here now
with the lip color I kind of change it
up every single time I do my makeup and
I've got these new ones from refre and
I've been loving them so much this is
called Laguna Beach so it's kind of like
a pinky I don't really know pink color
I guess so hope you guys enjoyed my
updated everyday makeup routine if you
did give it a thumbs up and I'll see you
all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
