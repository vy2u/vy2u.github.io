today I'm going to be showing you all
how to do my eyebrow routine a lot of
you guys have actually requested on how
I drew this so I thought I'd finally do
a tutorial to everyone who's been asking
basically there's not really much true
my eyebrows I just draw them in a shape
that I rather like so I'm going to be
using all of am a local cosmetics
cosmetics today I've been using this up
so much I'm almost out of the gel that I
use on my brows everyone often what I
use and I always use this I've been
using it so long and I'm obsessed with
this stuff so I'm just going to zoom in
a little bit so you can see a little bit
better and we'll get straight into it so
the first thing I like to do is just
take an empty spoolie brush and I'll
just brush through my brows I actually
just got them done that yesterday as
well so I thought it would be the
perfect time to do this while they're
nice and clean and there's nothing no
extra hairs around the edges or getting
in my way so I don't really trim my
eyebrow hairs I like to keep them quite
long so I can stick them up and make
them bushy if I have a bushy day or if I
want to have an Instagram Brown
Instagram per hour day I'll just point
brush them up at all now I don't know if
you guys can tell but this one here is a
little bit skinnier than this one here
that's because I'd rather men to be
sisters are not twins so I'm going to
work on either just making this one a
little bit smaller or this one a little
bit bigger so the first thing I like to
take is their brow pomade this is in the
shade taut it's meant to be the lightest
one but it's a little bit darker which
is good cause I like having dark brows
so I'm just going to be taking this on
the well of cosmetics Pro 7 M brush
alright so then what I'll do is I don't
really want to talk when I do this
because I rest my hand on my face but I
got fake down on that flat 7 so what I
do is I basically just draw a line
underneath where the hairs grow and then
extend it out on the edge here
okay so once I've got that line
happening under there what I then do is
I kind of flick the brush upwards
through the brow and then because this
one is a little bit naturally bigger
than this one what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to try to create a new
line on trough and then I just kind of
bring it down over the edge also kind of
got my shape going on up here
then what I do is I just take that exact
same brush and I kind of just sleek up
and then I just turn the brush on a
straight thing like this and just kind
of mimic little hairs and kind of pull
it across like that then I'm just going
to do the same on the other brow just a
line underneath some people don't like
doing a line all the way down to the
front of the brow but I do because I
feel like that's where it starts but a
lot of people stop their line here and
just kind of brush the head into place
for a more natural sort of look that
nothing about my eyebrows is natural and
then I'm just doing that one on top
again that I was talking about before
and I kind of extend this end part here
okay pretty transparent at the moment
because this is such a light shade but
I'm sure I do asked with specific
startup so next step what I like to do
is I like to take a powder and just go
over or everything that I've just done
because I feel like it just makes it
look more full and everything's more
filled again so for the front of my brow
I'm going to take the torque shade of
the eyebrow powder and I'm just going to
take a different brush this as the Garbo
and Kali brow brush and I'm just going
to literally just like put that in the
front and just push it all through so
it's nothing too special then what I
like to do is I take the other brow
powder in the shade maca and I like to
put this through the rest of everything
to fill everything in completely so
these have two shades in them so I like
to just kind of switch across both and
then I just go straight in the middle
and just cover everything that I've done
because it fills in like all the little
lines and stuff like that that the
pomade doesn't fill in so the primates
like it gives you your shape but this
fills in all the little lines and stuff
for the middle part and the anime dry
understand switch of this other brush
this is the Holy Grail angle definer and
just using that same dark powder and
they go over the edges and just the same
on this eyebrow obviously so there's
really not that much to it I'm just
going to show you guys how I can seal
them to get that whole like perfect
little book so to do this I'm just gonna
be taking one of the highest coverage
concealers of these heart-shaped take in
the shade like so when I do this part I
like to rest my arm on the top I've got
like a little desk in front of me so I
like to rest my arm on that just because
it gives me absolutely precision which
is exactly what I want so I basically
just put concealer all under the brow
with this applicator and then I go in
just with any synthetic
like flap top sort of brush you can use
a straight brush or a circle brush I
prefer this one because I like you can
get in there more and it turns with your
brow rather than a straight one and then
I just take some azar and then I just go
straight up against it
and then I just kind of bring it down
the front I basically just go exactly
where that line was and I pull it down I
always pull my concealer down send them
to sprout again just left that conceal
up on but I'm going to take this this is
actually a baking brush from Sigma but I
love it to pull my conceal it down just
onto my lid and I just pull all that
down and kind of cut over it just like
blends it all together normally I put a
shit-ton one for my eyeshadow but I'm
going to be doing that today what it's
going to do the brown okay now what I
like to do to conceal the top of my
brows is I normally use the shade of
foundation that I'm going to be wearing
so I am can at the moment so I normally
just go in with the foundation over the
top because I hate having that
highlighted like if I was use this on
top there and using the dark foundation
it would also good Apple so I'm just
going to grab that so for my foundation
today and what I'm going to use to
conceal the top of my brows is the Marc
Jacobs remarkable in the shade 54
hanging medium because this is going to
be my foundation for today so this stuff
is literally it can fill us so you own
into the tiniest bit so I'm going to put
a little bit there a little bit there
okay then I'm going to take the same
brush that I use underneath my eyebrow I
just like lapsed off a little because a
little bit of concealer left on there
and as you can see this is a super full
coverage
show it over the top and then I'll just
blend that concealer out and then I'll
just go back in with the powder a little
bit more and I just run over the top
edge of that brow okay now we're almost
done now what I like to do is I just
like to take a brow setting gel v14
mellow and this is in the shade dark
brown if they're tinted brow gel so
basically this helps it stay in place
all day and it does color the hairs a
little bit as well so I just like to
take that and just run it through the
front and then I just take it and go
over the other hairs I just avoid the
sides because I don't want to hit this
on the sides anything like that so I
just avoid that completely and just go
straight in on there okay and that is
pretty much everything for my brows okay
guys so that's pretty much everything
for my eyebrow routine I hope you guys

forget to give it a massive thumbs up I
love you guys so much and I'll see you
