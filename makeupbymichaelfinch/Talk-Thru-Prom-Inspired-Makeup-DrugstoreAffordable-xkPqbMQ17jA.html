channel so today I thought it would be a
good idea to do a prom inspired makeup
tutorial and the products I'm using are
fordable / drugstore action airy -
pretty much all dosed off there's a few
affordable things in there so for
today's video I have teamed up with a
deck of scarlet socks basically a
subscription box where every two months
you get a new like eyeshadow palette and
eyeshadow palette also has like
lipsticks highlighters and/or blushes so
you pretty much get everything in one so
it works out to be cheaper and just so
you guys know I get the palette a little
bit before it comes out so I get to play
with it and test it you know what I'm
saying
so this season's palette pretty much
comes with three different eyeshadows a
highlighter a blush and two different
colors and also a lip chubby which is
like a lip sort of like a lip crayon I
guess so pretty much each new palette
that comes out is a collaboration with a
top youtuber which i think is so cool as
I said in a video a few weeks ago I love
it when youtubers get to collaborate
with makeup brands I think it's so cool
and it just really shows the power of
social media and make our much social
media is a big deal to makeup brands and
this month's palette is a collaboration
with a Babs Beauty here on YouTube so I
think it's so cool if you guys want any
more information about this the website
will be linked down below and let's get
straight into this tutorial okay so as
you guys can see I've already done my
brows because I want them to be slinky
this time ain't no natural brows up in
here honey as per usual we're gonna get
started on the eyes first so I'm just
going to zoom y'all in so you can see my
lids hi how are you done okay now that I
put you guys in nice and close so you
can see all my flaws in my face
vlogs and pores same thing so first I'm
going to be taking the LA girl Pro
concealer this is in the shade porcelain
I have not used this in such a long time
and I'm literally obsessed with this
concealer don't know why I have a new
sir because just been trying new things
you know trying to change it up a little
bit so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to conceal under my brow first and
then just bring it all the way down onto
my lid
all right so I'm just going to bring
this all across my lid because I'm going
to be using it as an eye base today as
you guys know I love to use concealers
of for my base I feel like it's just so
much better than a actual eye base yes I
miss this concealer so much the
consistency in the coverage on is
impeccable
literally impeccable thank you now
typical makeup by Michael venge
I never say my name like that typical me
I forgot to wet my Beauty Blender Tom's
going to blast it with some fix+
bullets so we're just how I like it now
I'm just going to go to town on these
lids and just completely a blend all
this concealer out look how good that
coverages don't play I like la girl does
not play at all and I love it
okay so I just took a phone call as I
always do and I did decide but now we're
going to do this eye so first I'm going
to be taking the shade called making
moves I think that's how you say it and
I'm just going to plug that directly my
crease and blend it up I have not done a
purple smokey eye and so and it's like
purple is perfect for prom I don't know
about anybody else but I think it's a
good idea sometimes when people think of
purple eyeshadow they distinct who car
and I'm like no not no sorry you can
make it work you can make it work and
not look like a hooker so I'm just going
to build at this color up release like I
always do
yes and then I'm going to mix in a
little bit of Sophia which is this
beautiful purple shade I'm going to
start packing on my out of V Purple's
are so pretty and so complementing to
like literally any eye color in my eyes
these are really easy to blend out so
I'm just like packing it on them
worrying about blending it afterwards
like it blends quite seamlessly okay now
I'm just going to blend that together a
little bit more so you should be looking
seamless once I pack that color I'm
going to move on to the shade called
peachy-keen I'm just going to spritz my
brush with a little bit of fix+ and more
or less just paint it all over my lid so
I'm just going to pack that color pretty
much just on the center and actually all
over my lid now I'm just going to dip
into a little bit of Sofia and I'm just
going to run that around the edges again
just to make sure does that lid color is
all blended out and we still have a bit
of purple showing up now we're going to
wing it today because
not and I'm going to be using the Amole
cosmetics gel eyeliner and I'm going to
go straight into this with an angled
brush and just go to town on these lips
honey I'm just going to do a wing as I
normally would I'm going to try and keep
this wing a pretty minimalistic today
that when you sew to moving on to primer
I'm going to be taking the other girl
Pro prep HD high definition smoothing
face primer what a name I'm just
going to apply this all over my face
make sure you really get it in those
pores push it in there I know that's
disgusting but your foundation sits so
much better than more you jab at primary
into your pores all those pores like
honey moving onto foundation I'm just
going to go straight in with one of my
one of my favorite foundations this is
the RCM a foundation it is so good and
makes you literally look flawless which
is exactly what you want to prom so I'm
just going to apply this all over my
face with a paddle brush and then I'm
going to go in with my Beauty Blender
and just go to town I know this
foundation super yellow but I'm by the
end it's all good
and now I'm just going to blend this out
but the coverage is perfect now I'm
going to take that same foundation just
on a little flap top synthetic brush I'm
just going to conceal the tops of my
brows because we're going for that the
lawless sort of lift today now if you
put that in between my brows now I'm
just going to do my forehead I'm
literally just taking this on
because it makes your skin look
literally flawless so now it's going to
take the bum of my bully blender and
just blend this out but should
think about having literally like
low-key gray white hair is if you get
foundation that you literally and
you're just gonna have yellow a
yellow hair line but I just put bronzer
all over and it tends to fix it
to an extent you know what I mean
natural conceal once again I'm just
going to take the la girl concealer oh
my god I swear it way too much out
that's not going to be fun and then just
taking my Baldy blender and just
blending this all out
and now I'm just going to run this same
concealer underneath my eyes it looks
like when you put it on it won't be full
coverage but when you blend it out it is
and it's amazing well you know what I
did one time I was using this and I
squeezed it was stuck and I squeezed and
it went straight into my eye and I was
just thinking about it now it makes me
tear up because it was so freakin
painful that video I never like live for
obvious reasons
oh you know what I should have kept it
and I could have put it in like a
blooper video or something I'll just
upload that fish it's an gigs and we'll
just blend this out with my Beauty
Blender yes I'm so impressed with this
concealer like I need to use this more
often but I'm all about that tight shake
tape last you know what I mean okay one
all that concealer is down so make sure
it's all blended and then I'm going to
go straight in on that with my courteous
lime powder haven't uses in such oh my
god it's everywhere
literally the worst packaging ever Cody
come out with something new with your
packaging so see this is I'm just
going to pack that directly under my
eyelids a really weird thing about
baking is when you do it on someone else
I always go oh my god that feels so
tight under my eyelids but I have never
noticed that before like it's never felt
tight and I'm just going to pop that
powder also where I put my concealer
just to set it extra well now to set the
rest of my foundation I'm just gonna be
taking the Australia's fresh and
flawless press powder and shade black
beige you guys know how I'd do it
I'm just going to set all the rest of my
foundation just in padding motions oh
and by the way the products I'm using
today have no flashback hence prom there
will be photos and just because this is
a prom makeup tutorial mean you have to
use a primer and you can do it for
literally any occasion this makeup is so
versatile and you can do what you want
there's no rules and that's what I love
about it it goes on and it comes off so
I'm just putting that all over where my
foundation is patting motions only
otherwise it brings the foundation off
underneath and that is a hot mess when
that happens talked to me before so
don't do it
now justification off my under eyes I'm
just going to take a little bit of Sofia
and I'm just going to put
directly under my lash line and I'm just
going to blend that out and pack on a
little bit more as I go and I'm just
going to keep some working this down
till the cows come home that is the most
body thing I think I've ever said but
but but I'm going take a little bit of
making Mo's I'm going to put that
directly up against my lash line just to
darken it a touch okay now to contour
I'm going to be using the essence shape
your face contouring palette I'm going
to take this shade right here
and I'm pretty much just going to go to
town on my face because if you're a
problem you need to be contoured for the
guys so just on my cheeks with this
little dome brush look how good this
contour palette is like it's so good I
haven't tried the other two shades in
there there's a highlighter and
something else but I've only used this
shade and I love that grunting my
jawline obviously that is an essential
circle this contouring kit is what the
whole I used this in a video a long time
ago and I fell in love with it and I've
just forgotten about it I was thinking
about doing a full face using the best
drugstore products video what do you
guys think I feel like that's a such a
good idea because there's so many I feel
like I should do two other because
that's how many drugstore products there
is our lives now to bronze up my face
I'm gonna take the Milani exile bronzer
all over Glo just from a a benefits
bronzing brush and just warm up my face
a little bit more now that was a
contoured bronze and such all at the
same time I'm just going to contour my
nose a little bit but I'm going to do
that off camera but I do have a fully
dedicated video and how I contour my
nose I will leave that links first thing
in the description if you guys are
interested especially underneath the
nose yeah sweet now I need a wipe off
this under I bake like right now now
going back to that palette I'm just
going to take the blush shade out of
that called Bob Bob Dean Bob de Bob
Bobby squats bobbidi squat to the top
because you shoot that cute yes so I'm
gonna take a little bit there it's like
a purpley sort of shade and we're going
to pop that right on my cheeky little
squats here now I'm just going to spritz
my face with a bit of fix+
I know I shouldn't be using sticker plus
an unaffordable tutorial but it's
honestly just the best then I'm just
going to take the highlighter shade
which is called gilded and I'm gonna
just go to town on my cheeks with this
highlighter guys and I'm just going to
blend that into my cheekbones and kind
of up the side of my face too because
why not okay I'm going to pop that on my
Cupid's bow then on the tip of my nose
is giving me all sorts of life love and
laughter thank you for mascara today I'm
going to be using the best best lash
extreme from Jordana I'm just going to
plunk this on your lashes my lashes are
a little bit cooked today because I
filmed a few videos so they've got like
a lash glue and stuff at them but please
ignore that I can't wait to put lashes
on lashes just makes everything amazing
currently just putting a second coat of
mascara on my bottom lashes to make them
extra zoom now for my lashes today these
are by lash Warriors one of my favorite
lash brand ever and they don't have a
name on them but I'll leave it in the
description
Kam's going to stick this on oh my god
yes can we that doesn't look so much
better with a lash on it yes now I'm
just gonna be taking the lipstick shade
called a brownies out of that palette
I'm just going to lay this over the top
of my lips what I've done is I've mixed
the lip chubby with some of that
lipstick from the palette mix them
together to make this beautiful muted
brown tone now I know this lip color
probably isn't everybody's cup of tea
but I wanted to use it something out of
the palette so I could show you guys the
whole look using the whole palette and
it's different it's different to what I
normally do normally I do like a nucleus
but this time it's a brown lip and I'm
kind of digging at it anyway guys that
is it for today's video I really hope
you guys enjoyed it if you did don't
forget to give me a massive thumbs up
