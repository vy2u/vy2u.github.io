channel hell I feel like it's
been a hot minute since I sat down and
filmed an actual video that's not
pre-filmed or a vlog I know I said this
every single video but I've had a lot
going on when master classes have just
all finished thank you so much to
everyone who came was such an awesome
experience I had so much fun doing it
six different cities five in Australia
and one in New Zealand was phenomenal
loved it anyway so today I'm just gonna
be doing a like dirty clubbing glam this
is gonna be like an easy version of it
it's not gonna be too in-depth it's
actually gonna be similar to the one
that I did in my recent vlog has quite a
few if you guys asked me to do a
tutorial on it even though it looks like
 because I was really really not
really drunk but I was half when I
was doing it in the vlog when I went out
clubbing in New Zealand and I did my
makeup when I was drunk you need to go
on silent fists so this is gonna be an
easy chit chat I'm just gonna chat about
a few things and I also have an exciting
announcement that I want to talk about
as well so stay tuned for that
especially if you're in Sydney a without
any further ado let's get straight into
this video
the guys starting off with my brows I'm
just going to be a brushing of them
through oh my god it's so nice to just
sit down and just film and chill again
I've missed it I missed it
I've missed it a lot so as I said before
I'm just gonna be doing what I did the
other night when I was in New Zealand so
basically I'm just gonna be taking the
benefit browsing brackets in the shade
at number three and I'm just gonna be
taking this side Lac dear we gonna do
like this and then you put it on your
face latias
okay I'm gonna try and not talk like
Chris as much it's kind of starting to
wear off each time I'm with Chris I just
talked I came for the next week and it
pisses all my friends off but couldn't
give two more about it says
alright so I'm just gonna gently go at
the bottom of my brow just to get some
shape diddly-squat eight and I'm just
going to bring it up through the other
side just like that I'm just gonna kind
of extend it filling in my brows and
that tinted is so easy like I don't
struggle with that at all
then what I'm gonna do is just gently
brush down these hairs now so nothing
gets in the way I'm just gonna fill in
the I mean I was gonna take the
remaining product on my brush and just
blend it through the brow oh my god the
 red wax and he just shut up I
swear to god dad being shiny like a few
weeks ago at that building like new
apartments around us and we didn't know
her and it was so loud and we were like
we message the people that like
party cooperate or whatever and more
like how much is it to stop
outlays because we don't want to live
here anymore with this shitty
banging every morning at like
6:00 I am oh my god it's so annoying so
if you hear anything like that
throughout the video sorry about it then
what I like to do is take the powder
side of the brow kit and I'm just gonna
set everything in place now and then
when I get to the front of the brow I'm
kind of just flicking it up like that
not putting too much definition on me
now as you can see all underneath my
brows I'm just taking the Kylie
cosmetics concealers in the shade Dan oh
you're the combo
now I'm just gonna be dragging this
concealer or even my lid as per years
literally when I did this the other
night I didn't even I think I did my
eyebrows lost because I forgot to take
them at the stop to blend this out I'm
just gonna be taking my morphe a beauty
sponge I'm just gonna really press this
concealer in now next I'm just gonna
take a little bit of powder and just
gently step over that now for my eye
shadow I didn't actually use this the
other night but I want to change it up a
little bit and you something different
I'm just gonna be taking the BH
Cosmetics glamour fetched glam
reflection rose a pallet oh it looks so
stunning now I haven't tried this before
so but I'm gonna see if I can do the
same look that I did the other night or
very similar literally what I did the
other night was just orange eyeshadow
all through my whole entire eye and just
 like blow it out right to the
edges this pimple needs to get fast cuz
I've had enough all right so I'm just
going to go straightening it with this
shade right here oh we have a lot of
fallout don't know if that's good or bad
and I'm just going to take this right
through my crease and start blending it
up my shadows a sorry pigmented and they
blend so well because Cosmetics has been
lifting up their game for like quite
some time now rather than doing like the
bright orange that I did the other night
I thought I'd do this color starts a
little bit more wearable because I don't
know I don't think a lot of people would
feel comfortable going out or any like
 neon orange eyeshadow but I'll
act it on me and I'm also just gonna
pack it over my lid area so I'm just
gonna build up this color wow that
blended out so nicely now I'm gonna be
taking a little tiny bit of this shade
right here just to deepen it up ever so
slightly
and Morris are just blending around the
edges now I'm going to take a clean
blending brush and just kind of run over
the edges to make sure everything's
nicely blended out all right so this
look is completely different to the one
I did the other night but like this is
more wearable and it's the same sort of
like style that I'm doing anyway
okay so now that both of my eyes are
done super easy super quick but makes it
kind of look like you put effort in I'm
from a scar today I'm just me taking the
a bad gal bang bag out Jonna bad gal you
look and I'm just going to be very
generously applying this to my lashes
this is like my new favorite mascara
like it's what I use every time now like
I still love roller lash and like the
two-faced one but this is like so light
weight on your lashes and it looks cute
and it doesn't transfer and its really
good for bottom lashes it's replaced my
Mac extended play gigablack lash don't
have to use trim of scars anymore okay
so now that my lashes are nice and
tortured in jizz for my lashes I'm just
gonna be taking these ones from Gemma
isabella these are in leaf style oh gosh
I don't know
g-g-gee I think G okay so moving on to
the skin I'm gonna be taking the mecca
Maxima anti redness primer um a lot of
you guys have been asking me to use this
in a video so oh my gosh it's
the colour of Shrek perfect Cammy I'm
just gonna be popping this oh I feel
like that just dulled some of my redness
on my face like here yeah it's anti
redness come on
so for my foundation today I'm gonna be
trying out this new foundation from
Bobbi Brown since the skin that
long-wear weightless foundation full
cover oil-free shine control I got this
in PR they send me a few different
shades so the shade I'm gonna be using
today is called
call ivory call ivory so we're gonna
give this a whirl I'm just gonna squirt
some of this onto the back of my hand

foundation I was gonna be taking the
Bobbi Brown ones that I was just talking
about before and I'm just gonna be going
in on my skin
oh I'm loving like the coverage on this
and it doesn't feel like I've got any
makeup on so I'm just gonna be layering
this all up okay so the coverage on this
is looking not too bad I'm just gonna go
ahead and conceal the tops of my brows
just with the foundation just finishing
off this jolly forehead I'm using all
sorts of products for this video like
drugstore affordable and like I and
 Cielo I'm just gonna be taking
the colour-pop concealer this is in the
shade fair neutral and I'm just gonna be
popping that under my eyes and also all
down my t-zone of the more the merrier
when it comes to concealer Phineas's
covers up all those regrets I'm
just gonna be blending this out with my
morphe sponge once again if you guys
haven't tried to call pop concealer it's
actually good y'all need to get
a monster it's so affordable and like oh
I look I'm just gonna blend out my under
eyes to make my under eyes today I'm
gonna be trying out this powder here
from a beauty bakery this is their
flower I have seen so much about this
brand
holy so I'm gonna give it a whirl a
little bit into the lid just gonna dip
straight in and I'm just gonna bake my
eyes and I'm also going to use this
powder to monster-like bake my nose my
chinny chin chin says probably not on my
chin
and pretty much everywhere where I
concealed now to set everything else in
place I'm just gonna go in with my
trustworthy fresh and flawless pressed
powder this is in the shade light beige
this is just going to give me extra
coverage as well as set all the rest of
my fun diddly-squat Dacian I'd be dead
without this powder is what a god star
good I'm just taking a little bit of
that orange shade that I used on top of
my eye and I'm kind
just literally just shoving it straight
underneath and smirking this ever so
slightly
actually a lot any single time I say
ever so slightly I mean the complete
opposite now I'm just gonna be popping
on a little bit of mascara through these
lashes just to get rid of any excess
powder that's falling on them and also
my bottom lashes now it's time just for
a little bit of bronzer I'm just gonna
be going in with my butter bronzer from
Physicians Formula I've been using this
every single time I did my makeup I just
can't get like pasta literally obsessed
it's just sorry oh it's so perfect for
my skin tone and it smells so good like
I literally just can't stop using it I
need some new bronzers to try out do you
guys know any that are like nice I've
tried the Too Faced
gold when I like that as well but I just
can't get past this one it's like but
I'm still literally obsessed it's gonna
run a little bit down the sides of my
nose this is literally what I did the
other night when I went clubbing I
literally just was like rough as
and just didn't give two shits about
anything being too perfect not even my
lash was stuck on properly I'm also just
gonna contour a little bit just with a
little bit of I'm just gonna contour a
little bit with a little bit I'm
benefits haul a light just a little bit
just to deepen this up ever so slightly
and I'm gonna run a lot down the sides
of my nose just to bring it back because
I've been looking like Lord Voldemort I
really need more contours bronzers and
concealers to try out so if you guys
know any new ones hit me up in the
comments below and I'll go on to
Sephora or Mecca or whatever I need to
get them from and buy them I've also got
the makeup revolution one sitting over
there that I've had for I don't
know six months no I've had it since it
came out pretty much and I just still
haven't got our hands of trying it I'm
just taking my bronzer brush and just
kind of running all over my face and I'm
just running what's left on that brush
down my neck
this is easy to follow so far yeah what
is this this is max global Glory skin
finish I want to know what this is I
don't know if it's a bronzer or a face
powder
it's just like a highlighter or
something that's pretty this is global
glow by Mac I've been wanting to try
this out for a while but I don't know if
it's a bronze or a highlighter but
either way that looks nice on my face
might just put some down here too it's
just like an overall face powder someone
let me know in the comments below
bit of a glare that's it alright moving
on to a little bit of blush I'm just
gonna be taking this one no I'm not
because that's too pink but blush today
I'm just gonna be going in with my
favorite blush pretty much of all time
now this is modern Mandarin by Mac and
I'm just going to brush this on
backwards
to give a more natural looking effect
you feel see how it just adds like a
little bit of color back rather than
being just like a contouring color okay
we're looking pretty good so far
alright so to highlight my face today
I'm just gonna be trying out the new
highlighter from efrat this isn't a
style shade pillow-talk it's like a
pinky I know it looks pretty we're gonna
give it a whirl and see how it goes
just taking my morphe highlighting brush
okay so that's super pretty but I want
something more like golden for this look
bit more glowy you feel your vibe so I
just dug one out from the archives this
is champagne pop by Becca and Jaclyn
hill I use Jesus all the time as you can
tell and I'm just gonna pop this that's
more of the color I was going for okay
Thibodeaux narrows to put the dick and
I'm also just gonna add a little bit of
this on my inner corner oh I've missed
this highlight I haven't used this in
literally like two years a year two
years I don't know
sorry pretty now for my lip color today
obviously I'm not gonna be changing it
up too much this is one by Mac called
all that's chipping don't like it don't
like after this look instead I'm gonna
be going in with the shade called burnt
spice by Mac this is the liquid lipstick
from them oh my god it's sorry sorry
beautiful
so I'm just lining my lips with dis and
popping up yes oh my god I love that now
to set my face I'm not actually gonna be
using it today but this has been my
 Saviour as you can see I have
gone through it quite a bit not running
had it for a few weeks this is the green
marble setting spray by a brand called
SLR now I first saw miss fame talk about
this years ago and I was like it looks
really good it's actually a tough film
forcing barrier to seal theatrical
makeup shake well before use now it's
pretty much just like the only
ingredients is isopropanol don't know
what that is to proper know and don't
know what that is acrylic resins which
is like in plastic like probably like in
these brushes like this sort of plastic
here or maybe in this I'm not too sure
and silica and fragrance so it pretty
much just creates a massive barrier over
your face and doesn't let your makeup
move like when I say this is the only
makeup setting spray that actually does
not like emit like you sweat through
this because I always sweat like on my
forehead a little bit especially I go
out clubbing drink alcohol my body heat
um my body temperature heats up and
you sweat through this but it does not
move it does not move if you have
trouble at keeping your makeup on get
this it's not the best thing for your
skin because alcohol is only bad if he
has skin and acrylic resin like you
might a little spray from
planning's on your face it works it
works so good and I'm literally obsessed
with that I've been using it every
single time this was my save got in the
melt the Maldives Maldives not Mel dies
now last but not least I'm just gonna be
taking a little bit of the benefit
24-hour brows are just running that
through my brows just to keep them in
place I like to flick up the front parts
of the brow like that to give them more
natural look not that I'm natural
whatsoever okay guys so this brings us
to the end of today's video I hope you
guys in joyed it it's just like a really
simple clubbing makeup that I did
