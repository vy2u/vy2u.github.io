channel so today I'm going to be talking
about something that is rather
controversial I'd rather it not be but I
feel like this video is gonna be quite
controversial because everyone has their
opinions about it which is totally cool
and I'm all for that so today I'm going
to be talking about the Nivea men post
shave balm and why I no longer use this
as a primer so as we all know the Nivea
men post shave balm took its route on
the internet when the hue toriel's
brought it up and saying it was a great
primer and raved about it and got
everyone turned on to work from people
like Nicki herself who - beauty kylie
jenner then posted a snapchat about it
and that just sent everyone absolutely
crazy so everyone is probably still
using it so I gave this product to go
because I thought it was so cheap and
I'm always down for like a drugstore
product that is amazing so mine was only
about $8 Australian dollars I got it
from Kohl's so cheap and at first it's
great as a primer like it really does
work for your skin as a primer that was
what I thought after using it several
times you guys have probably noticed
that I don't use it in my videos anymore
why because this is why so this product
main ingredient is glycerin now too much
glycerin can be bad for your skin it
depends on your skin type but too much
can be bad for your skin now I did a
little bit of research on some of the
main ingredients in this product and I
found out a few you know pieces of
interesting information so the first
ingredient we're going to talk about is
called dick a prior rule carbon egg now
I'm not very good with dick a prior or
like dick dinner dinner dinner dick a
prior rule so this ingredient basically
penetrates the skin and helps put other
products into the skin so it strokes
into the skin
all right obviously the main ingredient
is glycerin the and another ingredient
that I found quite you know weird is
isopropyl palem aids so it's a
thickening agent and it's almost used in
most cosmetics which is totally called
I'm down for that
however in the long run it can clog your
pores it just depends on how it reacts
with your skin type so the Nivea balm is
made to heal the skin so it is a healing
balm and it is meant for men's shaving
rash which is quite an intense thing so
you've got shaving rash and then you've
got using it as a primer so they're
quite bit different things so a primer
is made to sit on top of the skin it's
not only there to only create a
protector
barrier to assure that your makeup stays
on but the actual products that you're
putting over the primer don't get
absorbed into the skin so this is meant
to sit on top of the skin and provide
you know a good amount of relief which
is what it does but then after a while
after a few hours of having this on your
skin this tends to sink into the skin
and if you're putting foundation over
this product this product is going to
pull the foundation and everything else
on top of that into your skin now a key
with this product is why I don't use it
anymore is because I started to notice I
got a lot of little white dots because
it was blocking all my karma don'ts
which is like a hair follicle on your
face or whatever which is like and then
of course is like unwanted blackheads
whiteheads pimples breakouts it can
cause rashes if you've got really
sensitive skin as well but I was
noticing I was getting all these little
white dots here up here under my eyes
and above here so guys if this product
works for you that is totally cool and
I'm so happy for you I'm actually
jealous that it works for you because
it's such a cheap primer and I wish it
didn't have the after-effects that it
does with me but if you have been using
this for a long time and you have
noticed you've been getting acne like
excessive amount exactly like meaning
more acne or the whiteheads or
blackheads or just like we interesting
is happening on your skin try to stop
using this and see if anything changes
because this could be the cause of all
your problems so I know this was a
really short video but a lot of people
have been asking me why don't you use it
in your videos anymore do you use it on
clients at all when my friends use the
products I kind of scream I know as a
parent they're like why not and I'll
feel them I said why don't you make a
video about it so I did a livestream
before on Facebook I was like if you
guys want to make a video comment now
and everyone was like yes makeup la la
la so it's like okay I'll make it so
here it was I hope you learned something
new today and I will see you all in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
