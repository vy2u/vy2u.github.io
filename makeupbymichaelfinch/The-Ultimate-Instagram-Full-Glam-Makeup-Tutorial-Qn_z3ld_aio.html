today I'm going to be doing an Instagram
makeup tutorial now I want this to be
like full beach glam I want it to be
intense and everything like that so
first of all I'm just taking my clothes
collection by the dip brow pomade and
just kind of like drawing out my
eyebrows and I will be doing a full
tutorial on my eyebrows soon I'm just
kind of skipping it for today because I
want to get into the makeup though I'm
just taking the UH Nastasia softer Brown
dürer eyebrow powder just to fill in
all the gaps and lines now I'm moving on
to my eye base I'm gonna be using a
concealer as my eye base two edges to
the Born This Way true face concealer
and I'm also going to be using this to
conceal underneath my eyebrow today just
to give that whole like Instagram
defined brow effect and I'm simply
putting a little bit more on just
because about you know we can and then
I'm just blending it out with a blending
brush to make sure there is no harsh
lines or creases you know what I'm
saying and yeah just making sure all
blend it out now you want to set that
before it gets a chance to crease so I'm
just using the Ofra banana powder now
for the fun part I'm using the morphe
three 5-0 palette or three five-o
palette and I'm just taking my first
shade and using that as the transition
and I'm just gonna be blending that out
seamlessly I want the blending in is to
be really really nice and seamless as
you can see so just blend blend and
blend and then you'll get the desired
look you know what I'm saying you know
what I'm saying
now moving on to a darker brown this is
like kind of like Coco bear from makeup
geek but it's morphe so I'm just using
that to to find my crease a little bit
more and just warm up the eye because I
do have greeny blue yellowy eyes
it is good at it does make them pop and
as you can see I'm just going backwards
and forwards with the warm brown and
their transition and going backwards and
forwards and then packing more on and
back of the void it's all about going
backwards and forwards it's kind of like
a smoky eye but just not as dark you
know so if you lose your transition you
just go back over with the brush that
you use and the transition color and it
all comes together moving on to this
darker sort of brown color it's kind of
like an off grade black that I actually
have a jet black in this palette so this
is what I went for
and it seemed to work for me it's just
defining the outer V and kind of
bringing a little bit more definition to
the out of the area as you can see I'm
just going back over with that warm
brown again just to diffuse that black
gray a little bit more now taking this
gold color I'm just taking a little bit
of mac fix+ just to make it a little bit
more pigmented and then I'm just
plopping that all over my eyelid area
and kind of bringing it up so there's no
harsh line at all I'm just kind of just
plopping it there and bringing it up and
I think it looks really really good now
moving on to something a little bit more
dramatic I'm just taking the Too Faced
glitter glue and applying that all over
my eyelid area you only need a little
tiny bit of this stuff for it to work
just the tiniest tiniest bit now I'm
taking a sparkling dust from Inglot and
I'm just applying that all over my lid
area with a flat sort of loose brush if
that makes sense
and look how pigmented this is it's safe
your eyes it's an i body face dust but
look how amazing it looks I'm literally
obsessed now moving on to liner this is
the Inglot 77 gel liner and I'm using
the little zoeva eyeliner brush with my
holy grail brush I'll leave it on the
screen now it is so so good you need
this brush in your life if you are
wanting to do or you know a master of a
gel liner you need this brush it is
literally amazing for gel liner
for my mascara today I'm just using the
Too Faced better than sex mascara and
you know for my lashes I'm using the
slay everyday lashes in the style I'm
pretty sure these will aways all
products we listed down below guys that
I'm just going over those lashes with a
little bit of Mac extended play
gigablack lash now for primer I said
this problem looks like dick cheese this
is the NYX angel veil primer and I'm
just basically putting that all over my
face it smells like coconut smells like
coconut now I'm at my friend's house sir
I'm using her makeup blue this is their
new album glass foundation and the
little twisty thing was broken I'm so I
just kind of dug it out with the
foundation brush but this foundation is
literally amazing like Marc Jacobs
remarkable what this foundation is so
good and it was so hard to get off my
face it is quite a thick base so I did
have to paint it on with a brush and
then go over with a Beauty Blender and I
did add a little bit of mac fix+ before
I did start Beauty Blender in and out
just because it is very very thick and
it needs that little bit of extra help
if you know what I mean if that makes
any sense
so yes gel as you can see I'm just
blending that right into my hairline now
for my concealer today I'm changing it
up a little bit you know this is the
bare minerals concealer it was a little
bit too yellow for me and probably not
as light but I made it work okay I made
it work it's actually a pretty good
concealer I remember when I went to
Mecca they tried to sell it to me I was
like oh no but it actually is pretty
good trying it out for the first time
today so I'm just blending that out with
my Beauty Blender as you saw before I'm
just adding a little bit of mac fix+
to assure that it gets a little bit more
hydration and doesn't crease as quickly
because I feel like that works for me
don't yell ah now just set that I'm
going back to my trusty espon powder
come on this baby hasn't had some love
in a few videos so I thought I'd bring
her out and I'm only baking little
triangles under my eyes I don't want to
go too far up now I did try a little bit
of cream contouring today and it was a
bit scary I'm just using the LA girl Pro
concealer I'm not a very good um you
know cream contour myself you know I'm
kind of getting used to it so yeah this
was the outcome of that and it kind of
just bronzed stuff my skin a little
wit and I don't really know if it did
much to be honest so yes I'm just
blending that out and making it look
seamless as possible you don't want to
know where the lines start and finish
now to set my entire face I'm just using
the Australia's fresh and flawless press
powder in the shade medium tan routing
that over everything John my neck make
sure it all blends and everything is set
because this foundation is quite thick
you kind of need to pack quite a bit on
I feel now for bronzer I'm just using
the Too Faced sweetheart
bronzer and I'm just going straight into
the kill as you can see I'm just
plunking that on this bronzer is so so
nice it's not too orange is perfect for
pale people aka me but I don't have any
fake tan on and I just tried contouring
my nose a little bit with some of that
bronzer because I can just a little bit
of nose contouring because I need it now
to actual contour i'm just using the
anastasia beverly hills contour kit
because everyone on instagram has this
and i find it amazing i'm obsessed
a lot of people say it's overrated but
honestly i don't think it is like it's a
good contour palette okay now I'm just
baking at the sides of my face baking my
contour is blue food now we've already
moved on to the high style so I'm just
basically doing what I did on the top on
the bottom of my eye so same order with
the three shadows so I used the orangey
sort of shade and then the warm Brown
Coco berry makeup geek sort of shade and
then I'm just going in with a darker
shade again and just basically what I
did on the top is exactly the same on
the bottom that's how easy it is people
you can see I'm just going in with that
darker shade and just blending it
straight out now instead of putting
black in my waterline I'm just using the
Tarte in a rim liner just keep my eyes a
little bit more open just a little bit
more open something little bit different
you know from saying now I'm just
dusting off that bag because it has been
there for quite a while and all the
products basically sunk into my skin so
there wasn't much to take laughs then
I'm just contouring my nose a touch more
I just feel like it needed it now bottom
lashes is Mac extended play gigablack
lash perfect foot bottom lashes obsessed
for my blush today this is the burning
up lash buyers away but it's such a
pretty like peachy non pink it's so
pretty I love it so much for my
highlight this is a based on my higher
this is ice cold by jeffree star
cosmetics first I'm using this and I
love it I love it I love it like look at
it look at it but wait we are gonna go
so much stronger you way ready for it
you ready for it
here it comes here it is oh there it is
artists could chew in Illuminati let's
do this you ready oh my gosh it is
literally amazing this is his diamond
glow powder look at that that's two
layers of the over ice cold OH
I felt like I had to put ice cold down
just to like you know give a little bit
of something-something under there but
yeah I'm just adding that on my
highlighted areas and then for my lips
today this is the NYX lingerie lipstick
this is a good lipstick not the best
liquid lipstick I've tried but it's good
for the price it was like 15 bucks in
price line it's a little bit drying but
it's not as drawing a some cheap liquid
lipsticks that I have tried so if I was
you I would give it a shot and see how
it goes for you now I'm just lining my
lips with a little bit as a lip liner
from the farm don't know what it's
called as you will know it will all be
listed down below all the products used
today you guys
please lining my lips a little bit with
that down and yeah you know then I'm
just adding a little bit more of that
artist Couture highlight on the inner
corners of my eyes and that is pretty
much it I just basically threw on a wig
and a cute little hat to get in the
Instagram vibe and and that was that so
