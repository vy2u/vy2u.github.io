channel so today I'm going to be doing a
full face of first impressions of a
drugstore makeup now the drugstore
makeup that I've got I haven't actually
used before I talking to me full on
first impressions and I'm actually kind
of excited because I felt like I have
not put my phone on silent when I'm
filming you know I feel like I literally
haven't done a drugstore makeup tutorial
in such a long time so I've got heaps of
new products from a drugstore and I'm
gonna get straight into this video let's
go ok guys so first we're gonna get
straight into my brows like we always do
sorry what am I gonna use so to
my brows today I'm gonna be taking this
a brute eye bracket from Ulta 3 it's a
super super super super affordable
alright so I'm just going to kind of go
in where the natural shape is as always
and by the way my eyebrows are orange at
the moment because this dumb dog right
here decided to put a fake tan all over
his face the other day when he went to
the races little not knowing that it's
going to turn his eyebrows
 orange I'm not gonna put the
bond I found Tyler alpha on my far so
felt like I would spring a lot like a
candle stock but please avoid to turn
hands please don't look at the tan hands
please don't comment about the tan hands
your will anyway but that's sad ok so
that went pretty well I'm just gonna
fill in this I'm not even using a like a
gel or anything I'm just literally
taking the powder and going to town my
god tan on my hand I'm so sorry if it's
distracting you but y'all just going to
have to deal with it and I'm sure a lot
of you are used to it by now
ok now that my brows are filled in let's
take some eyebrow gel juses again from
all three I tried to change up the
majority two products from all different
brands to small so it's one brand so
this is in the shade brunette so it's
darker which is good for more you know
well so dark okay this is a very dark
that's okay it's working it's tempting
their hair that's doing the job I don't
know what the fuck's going on with this
eyebrow though okay now that my brows
are filled in and they look extremely
dark dr. kay moving on to concealer
today I'm going to be trying out the
L'Oreal infallible treadle cover
concealer palette I guess and I'm
obviously just going to be taking at the
latest shape just here or
on a flat top brush I'm just going to
conceal straight under the brow okay so
those colors probably a little bit too
yellow for me but we're gonna make a
 work like we always do well to an
extent now so take that color all over
my lid and just pack it on so it's
completely totally covered I've mixed in
a little bit of the pinky tone next to
the yellow one as well this one just
here rather than the banana
shade happening up in there but now I'm
just going to take my damp Beauty
Blender and I'm gonna blend it out huh
and yes I did just get up to where my
Beauty Blender shook sugar I'm shook up
now set that in place I'm going to be
trying the Rimmel match perfection ooh
air silky new fail-safe how dearly
 that up didn't I sorry Chris
sorry to let you down to by the
time I get this resin there's gonna be
about a million creases in my
eyelid that's a problem that come off
 sakes from are these bloody seals
trust all companies stop C on
everything I can add it up better up
there yeah okay now some take a little
bit of that translucid learson heavy lid
and just set all that concealer now for
my eye shadow today I'm going to be
trying out the peach byf eyeshadow
palette so these are the colors inside
and I'm really excited to see how these
work so first of all I'm going to be
taking the shade called dainty which is
this white color here on the end and I'm
just going to pop that kind of just like
all over my lid I mean all over my
underneath the brow you know now I'm
going to be taking the shade called
lavish which is this purple ball one of
my pack I'm talking about pinky ass
looking shade top off the brush you lift
I'm gonna just go straight in oh okay
how are you it's blending up really
nicely and it's pigmented well so I'm
just adding in more color using the same
brush in little circular motions that
was easy simple blended not chalky stood
the side so I'm literally just sitting
here and just adding more product and up
blending as we go now I'm going to be
taking the shade cool
old sleigh this one right here
okay once that lid colors on we go back
in with a little bit of the pink shades
that I used all throughout my crease and
just kind of blend around the edges so
there is no you know harsh lines or
anything like that once again I'm just
gonna clean up underneath my eye okay so
now for primer today I'm gonna be trying
to face base skin primer from a model
car or it's quite sticky which isn't a
bad thing put some on my fake tan patchy
forehead such a mess hey okay
I keep saying that what about clubbing
sometimes now I'm like hey hey I'm like
 up you sound like a duck a literal
actual drowning duck ducks even
drown they don't suggest moving on to
foundation guys going to be trying to be
a luminous hydrating foundation from
designer brands this is in the shade
eight or to classic ivory so I'm just
gonna squirt some of that onto the back
of my fern take my Beauty Blender and
we're just gonna go in up on this face
job okay coverage is it's definitely
incredible and I've literally only just
applied it to my actual face that's
actually amazing you guys seeing this
we're gonna be so sick of Shaving I'm
seriously debating about getting IPL
like I just I want it I need it I need
it so badly
keke cool all right I'm going to take a
flat brush again
I need to conceal the tops of my
eyebrows so I'm just running around the
edges on my brows with some of the
foundation okay once my brows are all
concealed I'm just going to cover up
this patchy ass lookin ass bitch ass
fake-ass 10s ass bitch
cover this all up this foundation is
such full off coverage like are you
actually serious Wow okay I'm so
impressed with that foundation now from
a concealed upon in my eyes today I'm
going to be testing out the elf black
concealer now I did look at this before
holy that is way too dark like I
literally cannot use this like look how
dark that is I'm sorry it's not
happening so I'm gonna have to go back
to the Loreal palette use the middle
shade from there I actually don't have
any other concealers that I haven't used
before so plus I'm just going to put
some I'm not really highlighting I'm
pretty much just concealing cuz I can't
really highlight what it is and it's
gonna put a little bit of concealer
where I need that little tiny bit of
extra coverage sorry I'm just going to
take my damp sponge again and just blend
this out now it's gonna go straight in
underneath my eyes and just blend out
this concealer here perfect okay now I'm
going to go straight back in with the
Rimmel translucent powder again the max
protection one and just get straight
into that so that again a cog over my
hands how that they look I'm so sorry
guys gonna put this powder all over my
nose too cuz if I get worried now to set
the rest of my foundation I'm going to
be taking the firming aid revive press
pad press powder delay from designer
brands and I was going to take that on a
big fluffy off brush and just go
over the rest of my foundation so it
sets and it does not move also it's
going to dust off that baked under there
true that's baked nicely actually now
going back in with the peach palette I'm
just gonna take that shame shame color
some color okay no ways uh going onto my
eye and I'm just going to blend that out
on a different brush simple but
effective you know now to contour today
I'm going to be taking the mud makeup
design defining contouring and
highlighting palette and I'm going to be
taking a bit of a shed and a bit of
shade right here I'm just going to go
straight in this with a light hand and
start okay blending out super nicely and
contouring this side of my face as well
gentle you don't want to do just one and
then move along to the next figure and
you cannot forget that draw a line if
you don't have one like me and under my
bottom lip and I was going to run the
same brush down the side of my nose ever
so slightly actually I'm going to take a
smaller brush
just a little bit of you know thank you
stinky okay
overall really impressed so far with
everything the bronze up my face a
little bit I'm just going to take them
dear Rimmel maxi bronzer laughs here
Beach and I'm gonna just take your lack
beers and go straight up going on these
cheekbones this is going to give my face
a bit more warmth rather than being so
cool tone and it's going to kind of
blend in with the contour that I just
did as you can see how it's like making
it look more blended and nice l bottom
lip jaw line and I like to drag my
bronzer down onto my neck for mascara
today I'm going to be trying this new
one from astralis this is a
collaboration that they did with kpop
Australis all in one mascara so I'm
gonna just give this baby a whirl so
it's probably not one of their best most
cars that have ever come out with but
it's not bad
you know what I mean actually I am
building it up and it is kind of like
coming together okay now for a little
bit of blush and highlighter I'm gonna
be taking the BAS sculpting glow
highlight bronze and blush palette so
I'm just going to take some of this
peachy sort of color blush and sweep it
onto my cheeks because this is going to
match what I have going on on my eyes
you know okay now moving on to
highlighter I'm going to be taking this
shade called pearl in here and okay not
bad at all and Cupid's bow it is
definitely super pigmented so pigmented
I'm loving this highlighter I'm going to
take a bit more and I'm going to put on
my inner corners and I'm also going to
put a little bit under my brow bone okay
guys last but not least now for my lips
I'm gonna be taking the Rimmel stay
matte liquid lip color now I just got
this in the mail today so I'm assuming
they're quite fairly new this is a shade
of being my baby I'm actually is going
to take a lot I've already got on my
lips because it does affect the lipstick
a lot
so it applied quite well probably a
little bit streaky but two layers sure
go go go go get Gavin and I
unfortunately I don't have a new setting
spray actually we do have a new setting
frack and test out this is the NYX Joey
finish spray it's actually shinies and I
left it here and scruff take it back say
thanks to someone just give my face of
sprit oh
