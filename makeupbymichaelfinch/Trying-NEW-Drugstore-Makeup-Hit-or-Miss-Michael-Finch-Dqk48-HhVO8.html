channel starting today's video I'm gonna
be trying out a bunch of drugstore
makeup that I bought while I was in the
USA so I've got brands from Maybelline
wet and wild
Milani Physicians Formula essence
Jordana Rimmel just a few things like
that personally I love doing these
videos because I do love my drugstore
products and I know a lot of you guys
love them as well I'm also super excited
cuz I've been wanting to try out a
foundation that I've got in front of me
here for quite some time now sorry let's
get into the video
sorry starting off I'm gonna be taking
the photo focus concealer from
wet-and-wild this is in the shade light
I think it was the lightest shade that
they had available and I'm just gonna
start by applying this under my brows I
just got my brows done hence why they're
a little bit red and their shape is
completely changed that's always what
happens and I love it okay so from what
I can tell already the coverage isn't
all that great but it's not a bad
concealer I mean for the price it's not
that bad I'm just gonna drag that down
onto my lid area too now it's gonna take
my damp Beauty Blender this one's by
morphe and I'm just going to blend out
this concealer what blends out super
well and it still keeps the coverage
that it's got now to set that in place
I'm gonna be taking the wet and wild
pressed powder this is in the shade like
once again the lightest one that I could
get I'm just gonna run this over my eyes
just where I've put all that concealer
just to set it all in place now when it
came to looking for eye shadow in
America they didn't really have many
options in stock sorry instead of using
eyeshadow today I'm just gonna take this
bronzer from Wet n Wild this is in the
shade bikini contest and I'm just gonna
run this through my crease crews haven't
said that one in a while have I - so I'm
just gonna take a big fluffy eyeshadow
brush and more let's just blend it
through my crease just artist something
in there do you not I mean this is such
a pretty transition color - so you could
use this with like when you actually use
eyeshadow you could use this as your
transition because it's nice and it
blends out well guys if you didn't know
I'm also doing master classes around
Australia and one in Auckland New
Zealand I'm gonna talk more about it in
another video but I'm gonna leave the
information down below I did a post on
my Instagram and I'll leave the link to
that down below so if you want to come
and hang out learn some things get some
goodie bags super bougie then come and
meet me come chat to me so I'll leave
the post down below for my Instagram -
oh that's right I totally forgot I got
this this is the Maybelline Color tattoo
I chrome like liquid eyeshadow I guess
so I'm gonna put this on my lid and see
what happens see what the pigments like
so this is in the shade gilded rose
sucked like a kind of like of rose gold
sort of color it swatches really well
that's what it looks like on my hand so
I guess I'm just going to go straight on
my lid with this and see what happens so
I'm just gonna pop that on my lid and
then I'm gonna take a little flat brush
or just any brush and I'm just gonna
blend around the edges I'm just gonna
add a little bit more to my lid and I'm
just gonna kind of press that and blend
that up into my crease area so I just
found this I should have had it here
from Rimmel that I got the other day and
it's got like this like lid color in it
that I could use so I'm gonna pop that
over the top yeah it's kind of just
covered up the other color but it's it's
a good base for your eyeshadow because
it makes it stick and show up rather
than spraying it with like a fixed puss
or something like that haven't really
done anything like this before but we're
gonna work with it but today I am gonna
be doing some eyeliner I'm gonna do a
big fuck-off wing as I like to call it
this is the Schwing eyeliner from the
balm now I think I used this probably
about four years ago so let's pretend I
haven't used it before and let's go for
it because I honestly don't remember
what it was like so you take it out and
that is what the applicator looks like
it's like a very pin pointed I don't
know if it's flexible yep it's very
flexible okay this could be good alright
so just bear with me I can't talk when I
do a wing obviously you know who and I
can breathe again so the Maybelline
stuff that I've put underneath the
eyeshadow has kind of interfered with
the liner because it's kind of got a
little bit texturing so it's really hard
to get like a crisp line across the top
of my eyelid but other than that this is
so good like it really lets you flick
your wing out let me just show you what
I'm talking about so like ready watch
this
what I mean it just lets you flick it
out and like blends the wing out does
that make sense okay so now that my
wings are done I'm gonna be taking be
wet and wild max volume plus mascara
it's in a big fuck-off pink tube I love
that and I'm just gonna go to town on my
lashes and see what this does
guys this is actually pretty good it's
not clumping my lashes at all but it's
making them super black and coating
everything just how I want it to
now I'm gonna stick my lashes on I've
got the adul at mega volume lashes I've
actually never tried of lashes from my
doll before I think maybe once but these
are like double layered or something so
they look really cool so what they look
like up close
that looks pretty good oh my god alright
so I'm just gonna stick this on so I've
just popped on some black lash glue on
the band and I'm just gonna pop this on
okay so this lash actually looks pretty
good I actually really like it I'm just
gonna take a little bit more mascara I'm
just gonna blend the falsies with the
real ease now it'll put this other lash
on and I'll be right back and we'll get
started on my face yes okay now to get
started on the face I'm finally gonna be
trying out the wet and wild photo focus
foundation this is in the shade shell
ivory I've heard so many amazing things
about this so let's put it to the test
so it comes out in like a little spatula
so I'm just going to pop this all over
my face
it's great with that and see what
happens I'm gonna take my damp Beauty
Blender again smells really gross yeah
so it's covering up everything that I
want it to cover I'm finding it really
easy to build up coverage so I'm just
gonna do another layer just why not and
I'm gonna blend this in once again well
the coverage is actually so good and it
looks like a real skin I'm so impressed
with this yes I'm literally gonna say
this right now this is my new favorite
drugstore foundation I wish this was
available in Australia in stores not was
easier to get if you're in Australia
wet-and-wild is actually really hard to
get onto you either need to get it off
like something like crush cosmetics if
they have it in stock or something like
that but there are places around that do
sell
so I'm just gonna do the same thing on
my forehead I'm gonna layer it up and do
two layers it's really hard to do makeup
videos when your heads down and like all
up in everyone's grille well what do you
guys think of my new hair just bleached
it all again I am gonna turn it a little
bit because I think it is a little bit
too blond and I like that more like a
Shiar sort of tone so I think I'm gonna
do that okay I'm so impressed with this
foundation what the okay let's hope
we have as much success as we do with
concealer as we do it with foundation so
I'm gonna be trying out the Loreal Pro
glow concealer so I'm gonna put this on
my chin you could by my nose and also
bit in the center of my forehead
this was the lightest shade that they
had available I wish they had something
louder but they don't so I were just
gonna make this work
now it's gonna highlight underneath my
eyes oh my god what the hell that just
like burn my under eye when the
chemicals went straight into my eye did
it or was that just me but now my eyes
are watering hmm okay I'm just gonna
blend this concealer out and see what
happens that's right that's right
oh my god oh my god oh my god
that burns oh my god my eyes the
chemicals out of it all the fumes are
like making my eyes water holy is
that good or bad should I keep going or
take it off I'm gonna blend this in what
the hell that was not a comfortable
feeling if anyone else has ever tried to
conceal I can you let me know in the
comments below
if it like is really sensitive to your
under eyes oh my god it feels like it's
still burning on this side okay I'm just
gonna give myself five minutes to go
relax and see if it keeps burning cuz if
it doesn't want to take it off but if it
doesn't then we'll move on okay so
everything is all good it stopped
burning but that feeling when I put it
on was not comfortable at all okay
moving on from that traumatic experience
I'm gonna be trying out the Maybelline
fit me loose finishing powder now I've
seen Nicki joy say really amazing things
about this so this is just the loose
powder I don't think
can get it in Australia yet but it is in
American stores and when I saw I was
like oh my god I've never seen that
before
I'm getting here so this is in the shade
fair it's the lightest one that you can
get and I'm gonna use this to bake my
undereyes and see how it goes I'm also
just gonna bake my entire nose like I
always do just because that does get a
little bit oily throughout the day I'm
gonna let that sit there for a second
and I'm gonna go back to the pressed
powder from wet-and-wild that I used to
set my eyelids today and I'm gonna go
over the rest of my skin and set all the
foundation in place okay now I'm just
gonna dust off this powder that I've had
sitting there for a second that looks
nice
makes my under eyes look really smooth
I'm actually so impressed with how this
powder sits on the under eyes it's like
not creased or anything and it's really
looking smooth doesn't have flash back I
don't know I'm hurt not oh my
god you guys I'm just sitting here and I
literally realized that I forgot to
prime my face I got too excited about
the foundation all right so let's just
ignore that I forgot to pack my pan not
prime is the kind pan okay so I'm gonna
be taking the bronze boost our
Physicians Formula bronzing contouring
palette and what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna take this in the middle shade here
it's like a cool tone sort of shade and
I'm gonna see if I can do some
contouring and chiseling out of this fat
head so I'm gonna take it the middle
shade just a little bit I'm just gonna
guard wow that is so nice dead set this
is the best contouring shade I'm gonna
kind of chisel out my jaw line as well
this is like the perfect contouring
shade for someone like me with my skin
tone what you guys to watch this and how
I'm blending it out because it's
blending so nicely and then I'm
obviously also just gonna contour down
my big jolly forehead a bit because that
is a must in my makeup routine every
time alright so once I've contoured my
face I'm just gonna take a little tiny
denser brush and I'm just gonna do a
little bit of work on this NARS
cuz I'm told I get the cops to get a
nice job I'm gonna have to keep
contouring it this is honestly blending
out perfectly and it's not going patchy
muddy
cake
you can build it up and like blend it
away I guess now I feel like we need a
little bit more bronze on this face so
I'm gonna be trying the wet and wild
color icon bikini contest bronzer this
is the same stuff I use in my transition
crease today and I'm just gonna take it
on the same brush that I used to contour
and just kind of blend it into my
contour it's got a bit of a luminous
glow to it so it's not like a fully
matte bronzer it's got a bit of a glow
to it well I've got this bronzer out I'm
just gonna put a little bit underneath
my lash line just so there's a little
something there underneath my eye now
for my bottom lashes I'm gonna be trying
out a different mascara this is the NYC
lengthening mascara now the reason why
I'm using this on my bottom lashes is
because it looks like it would be really
good for bottom lashes but ha ah what
fun ah so it is actually pretty good
football time lashes now for my
highlighter today I'm gonna be trying
out the essence pre nude highlight up
this looks exciting so I'm just gonna
take it on one of my favorite
highlighting brushes cuz I've lost the
rest of them this is just the XO Beauty
logic blender brush just drop back on
this is sorry pretty it's like very
subtle but like can you guys see what
it's doing it's quite powdery which
isn't a bad thing but when I am gonna do
because I'm gonna spray my brush just a
little bit I'm just gonna spray my brush
with a little bit of mist nothing really
more happen and what pigment went on but
it is a very pretty highlight and for
the price amazing now I do believe I
picked this one up in Ulta Ulta in the
the u.s.a in LA now last but not least
I'm gonna be setting my face with the
Physicians Formula hashtag install ready
setting spray so let's give this a whirl
it smells like it's got alcohol in it
which is good because it makes your
makeup sound but alcohol is really bad
for your skin whatever it takes to keep
my makeup on I mean I'm gonna do it I
used to spray my hair with hair
spray when I was younger spray my face
with hair spray not my hair obviously my
hair too but rock on it sorry for my
lips I'm gonna be trying out the Jordana
sweet cream matte liquid lip color this
is in the shade but a cream frosting
now I swatch this in the store and I was
like
it's actually a really pretty color
sorry let's go to town and it smells
like Kylie Jenner's liquid lipsticks
check it smells exactly like them so
that's one layer I'm just gonna go over
my chocolate with a little bit more
product okay I am pretty impressed with
this lip color and this overall look the
only thing that I don't like about this
look is the eyeshadow because it's very
textured because I chose to put a powder
over a liquid and it went really
textured and kind of let me didn't get a
precise line when I was doing my
eyeliner but everything else I am so
overall impressed with so this is the
end of today's video I really hope you
guys enjoyed it and you learned
something today or you found a new
product that you want to try out because
the reason why I love doing these
drugstore videos is because I love that
they are all affordable and I love the
fact that you guys can like see what I
do with it and then if you like it it
can inspire you to do something with
your makeup or you can be inspired to go

different things with your makeup I love
