finally I'm sitting down filming a new
fucking video if you guys cuz it's been
a very long time since I sat in this
room actually this is now a new room
because I moved in to a new house so the
background is a little bit different
just a little bit I know I haven't been
posting on YouTube pretty much at all
lately I've had a lot of shit going on
but I'm all good now and ready to go
let's beat this face now if you can't
tell from the title today I'm gonna be
doing a testing Instagram hype makeup is
it worth it sort of thing you know
buddy hey stop chewing that cut it out
talk about a bunch of makeup in front of
me some of it's been 70s what I've
bought it's all over the place um I'm
just gonna go straight in and see what
happens
sorry the first thing I want to try out
is this base from P Louise now I've seen
nikkietutorials I've seen a lot of
people going on about this that is
absolutely incredible be Louise actually
did send this to me as well as her
palette which I will be trying out in
this video today as well now this is a
base that apparently you don't have to
set so you don't set it with a powder
and you just go stirring with no shadows
which I've never done before um but I'm
kind of excited because I do have some
eyeshadow palettes aren't very pigmented
so I really want to test it out with
this to see if it like helps improve the
pigment and whatnot right so I'm gonna
squirt a little bit of this onto the
back of my hand this one it's got kind
of like a pinky undertone to it
and I'm just gonna take this a little
cute brush and I'm just gonna go in and
conceal under my brows before I spread
it all over my lid very full coverage
which I love
okay now what I'm gonna do is bring it
down onto my lid area boom
lack there now I'm gonna take my damp
Beauty Blender and just take a little
bit more product on that and blend okay
that's really good that looks really
fresh love that alright so now that I've
got my eyeshadow base on it has creased
a little bit but I think that normal and
you blend it down into eyeshadow it goes
onto something I'm not sure about the
palette I'm gonna be using this is also
keep a Louie's palette I've seen a lot
of other youtubers use this and they say
that it's absolutely incredible so busy
well give it a whirl done well give it a
well don't know what I'm gonna do though
doll but I'll work it out don't what the
fuck I'm actually gonna do holy
shitballs I want to try and use a lot of
colors in here so we're gonna do
something crazy and dramatic so you get
the full feel of the palette you know
what I mean something a little bit
dramatic don't you know let's use this
Mac to t4s know what color shall I going
with first been doing shit I really
don't know what to do I might just take
tripping first which is just nude shade
then I might just part of this just
through my crease just so there's
something BA is that does that kind of
Sonia I don't know I'm just gonna a
flirtini okay cool I'm gonna go in with
the shade called bent which is like a
red orangey sort of shade and what I'm
gonna do into the inner corner and just
blend now this is sorry pigmented you
don't need much at all I think I'm gonna
use this as my like transition
transitional company clean brushes here
a bindi I'm a little bit concerned about
the situation that I've got right in
front of me I'm just gonna take another
brush and slightly blend this
now as I said I have no idea what I'm
doing so I don't know what the end
result is gonna be like but I really
hope it's absolutely stunning that's
like a pinky shade but that's really
nice so I've just been playing around on
decide but I've just been adding in more
and more color because they build up so
well loved okay so I'm just blending on
pretty much almost all the way up to my
brow bone and just blending it into my
unicorn now we're you know and we need
to grate in a different shade to make
this more Jamaat what shall we do
let's vary images red color so I'm gonna
go in with the shade cold Queen which is
this red now red eye shadows are really
hard to make so I'm kinda steam
that's really pigmented I'm just gonna
pop it on wow it's just just to like
deepen up the crease ever so slightly
okay now that I've got those cheap hours
down I'm just gonna go back in with my
brush that I used previously and blend
out red our eye shadow kind of winging
this out as well you guys just chillin
with it
I'm just adding some more red through my
crease and onto my inner corner just in
here well I really like this
that's like blended so incredibly what
was a get off that makes my eyes look
really blue hey getting bigger and
bigger as the days go on being date okay
guys now what I'm gonna do just to
deepen up a little bit more is I'm gonna
take the shade of martini you guys the
best thing about living where I live is
I'm right over where all the planes go
like all the internationals all the
domestics I'm pretty sure it's
everything and they go right over my
house and like I love the planes because
I'm a country boy and seeing planes go
evolve constantly that I like right in
my backyard is like the best thing I've
had a Thane alright taking the shade
martini
okay you can't see the color but it
definitely has it deepened to a lot it's
gonna blend that up with my brush from
before am I gonna leave we're gonna
leave it at that for now the crease yeah
what I'm gonna do next is I'm just going
to take a little bit more if the P
Louise eyeshadow base that I use oh my
and I'm gonna do a concrete so what I'm
gonna actually I'm gonna do like a mere
two cut crease does that make sense so
I'm just gonna pop it on the center we
gonna do
black near then I'll just go uh uh I
think we have a line okay I'm just gonna
do make it a little bit longer on the
inner part okay I'm gonna leave it like
that then what I'm gonna do is just grab
a flat shader brush that's got dust in
it from the move
wow that is saravana hygienic Mindy and
I'm gonna take the shade cochon which is
the white and I'm gonna pack that on
over that base because I'm really
digging this whole fish
that's cool okay now that we've got that
going on I need to fix the edges now to
fix these edges a little bit I'm just
gonna take a little bit more of burnt
which is the first transition that I use
and I'm just gonna pop that on the edge
of the eye while we're doing this
hey then I'm gonna take a little bit
more of my teenie which is the pebble
then when I get to the inner corner I'm
just gonna blend that in really gently
it kind of just blends into the Wi-Fi
it's so mr. earnest happy with that
let it go we're almost done with these
eyes guys it's all about testing out
colors shut up I'm just gonna take a
little bit of the shape unto up and I'm
just gonna put that on the inner corner
just to add a little bit of definition
the outer corner as well because it
shows up a little bit but then my teeny
I love these chars because when you
blend them out they don't disappear do
you know what I mean
okay guys I'm now back and I just did my
wings off camera because these took a
long time okay
but this is the situation we're dealing
with oh and I also use the English a gel
liner that's not a first impression
because never try to I mean I've tried
it I use it all the time
fuck yeah moving on to mascara I'm gonna
be trying out this one here from Lancome
this is the hypnosis Hypnose this is the
hypnosis mascara now I know when I went
to Khloe Kardashian's masterclass in
Sydney fucking years ago she spoke about
this being her favorite mascara I think
don't count me on it don't count me on
it don't count me don't quote me on it
there we go got it I'm just gonna give
this a whirl I mean like it's nothing
special
it definitely separates your lashes and
gives them like a natural look but still
make some clique they've got mascara
okay start is now on PS don't know
what's going on with my hair today it's
all over the shop and I'm also missing
it now thanks okay moving onto lashes I
don't have like an Instagram hype repair
I would be using here to be eaten but
don't have them but I got in the mail
today these are from a brand called
backstage lashes these are from the UK
I'm pretty sure um this style I'm gonna
be using is girls night out
they look sickening sorry I'm just gonna
stick these on cut them to me sighs
sticking the fuck on Joe oh god I don't
know my tweezers are that's always fun
okay eyes a little done fucking finally
now we're gonna be busy gonna cheat at
their face now the primer that I want to
test out today is the taut shot this
silk canvas now I've seen how many
people rant and rave about things all
right let's just give it away they were
happening I wouldn't know what the fuss
is about
now I don't know how to apply this
properly sorry I'm just gonna take it on
a stippling brush it's like a boy it's a
boy
I guess one girl's gonna hmm top your
products all smell like sorry good this
smells exceptional I'm just gonna buff
this into my skin I forget this jolly
forehead
yeah applied that old Irv up my face I'm
gonna touch it go back I can never
really tell with primers it feels good
it smells good and I'm guessing it's
gonna work
how's even work okay moving on Syria
foundation I'm gonna be trying out the
light birth long lay a foundation from
Mecca Maxima a lot of you guys have been
asking me to try this out for a very
long with doughnuts so I'm gonna give it
a whirl this is in the shade 2.0 ivory
it's gonna squirt someone to the back of
my heart take my Mac one nine one brush
I believe I'm just going to just gonna
do a little bit of my face cuz this one
dart lashes and I'm taking it off do you
know what I mean I mean it's definitely
not full coverage obviously because it's
black birth but we owner I'm a full
coverage type of gal but what I will do
is I'll just put it on so you guys can
see what it looks like and then I'm just
gonna run our with a little bit of a
different foundation just to give me
more coverage which is what I want
so this is what it looks like I've only
done the bottom half of my face it's
very light coverage which I don't like
at all but what I'm gonna do to fix that
up I'm just gonna take a little bit of
my Dior skin forever shine control
foundation bullshit wank I don't know
and I'm just gonna go over just to give
me the coverage that I want and need
that's the coverage I'm looking for
right
please don't ask that yeah okay moving
on to the concealer I'm gonna be trying
out the all nighter waterproof full
coverage concealer from urban decay I've
heard this is really good now I'm in the
shade fair neutral Fox Fox May night
so the coverage is so good but we're
gonna see what it select under my eyes
before we finally decide all right I'm
now gonna get this concealer well under
my eyes please be good I'm just gonna
dip it in each side once I'm dip for
each under I mean fuck me I'm sorry
about uh putting sentences together and
so I have friends who help me with how
to talk let's do it oh well that is
quite the full coverage now because I am
Michael I'm just gonna add a little bit
more for good luck you know okay maybe
once you set my under eyes they'll be
trying out this one from Marc Jacobs
this is the invisible perfection coconut
setting powder in number 34 invisible I
guess this is new I gotta send this in
PR I didn't even know they had this to
be honest I got it in the mail fuckin
nails on so I've managed to get the lid
off and it's like a little cushion in
here and you kind of just dip your
sponge or your brush or whatever in so
it's sort of scary to try and you say
how did you just don't know what's gonna
happen so it's definitely not invisible
it's definitely go to college to it
which is fine because my concealer on my
under eyes was quite dramatic and
intense by what I'm gonna join Yasmin
was gonna take some more of this powder
just on a fluffy brush I'm just gonna
sit the rest of my face with that
okay it's definitely giving my skin some
color maybe it's not translucent maybe
it's meant to have a bit of color to it
because it definitely is giving off
quite a bit of color all right I said
that enough
wish my hair would just fuck off for
like five minutes okie dokie now for
contrary I'm gonna be trying out this
Jennifer Lopez Inglot I don't even know
if this is the contour because it
doesn't say two surfaces freedom system
power on the back but it looks like a
cool toned poncho our shade I'm just
gonna give this a whirl don't know
what's good bad shit Pierre so far but
just great okay I'm just gonna go ahead
and contour my whole face but I'm gonna
speed it up because this video is
already gone for long enough let's go
so this looks a hell of a lot cooler in
the palette than it does on your face so
it's kind of bronze me but not
completely but I'm just gonna leave it
as is and I'm actually going to now
bronze I don't know if this is gonna be
more cool tone or warm tone oh my god
mother's my mother's a hot ass it's kind
of fun we all do it every now and again
it's funny not really a bit annoying
what about Michael alright moving on to
bronzer again I'm gonna be taking the
Chi Faced chocolate Soleil this is the
new packaging they have so many
different shades of this now I'm gonna
give this the world ah oh shit very
pigmented
my god indeed holy fuck bullshit of cool
I'm just gonna go in super lightly with
this because this is pigmented candle
it's gonna take a little bit down the
side where it's just a little bit we
gonna do luckiest jawline quite
intensely love this make God thank God
for makeup seriously I've gone from zero
to today okay guys so I've just done
with the underneath of this I'm just
gonna show you guys how I did it so I
pretty much just took the shade burnt
and went straight up all under year
these shadows are so fucking pigmented I
can't even explain and buildable and
when you go over them with another color
it doesn't blend away which I think I've
already said but I'm stayed again
because it's worth it so valid point
bitch hey so I'm just gonna keep adding
burnt under Jacobs brush I've had for
ages but never put it to use then I'm
gonna take a little bit of shade Queen
which is that really nice red and I'm
just going to blend that together
nothing too special
now I'm gonna shake take the shade
control which is the dark purple and I'm
just gonna pop that right up against my
lash line so that's pretty much d under
eyes done I'm just gonna pop on a little
bit more if this um mascara I'm just
gonna go over my fake ones put a little
bit of powder and I'm just a little cute
nighttime drives looking really bright
or is it just me before I continue I'm
just gonna pop some of this Naz orgasm
lip balm on they can have is a new
collection and the packaging is just so
nice I love it
but now I'm just gonna garden with a
little bit of blush and I'm gonna be
taking the very very famous blush in the
shade orgasm this is just fair
repackaged stuff it's really really chic
I love it and I'm just gonna pop on a
little bit of blush gonna use the same
brush that I use for my bronze off I'm
just gonna put a little bit on cuz I'm
not a very big blast boy but that does
add a nice amount of cute come up bindi
moving on to highlighting I'm gonna be
taking this from a k'kaw Beauty this is
the highlighter palette number one okay
now I'm gonna be trying out the change
probably like whoa bye
so pigmented fucking I swear to God
shadi has stolen all of my honest RCIA
23 brushes she's got like 800 at her
house if you're still watching at this
point can you tweak her and let her know
to give it back to me because I need it
what am I gonna fucking use oh my
goodness I guess I'm just gonna be using
this brush from Real Techniques and I'm
a girl in with I know this is gonna be
too dark to me
just have a look definitely not to talk
oh is stunned
pretty clear what I'm gonna do is just
pop it on my cheeks I'm gonna put this
down first but then I'm gonna go in with
the shade up yeah which is a little bit
lighter this okay laughs that looks fun
yeah I'm just going to clean my lips off
so I can pop I'm a nice bit of color for
my lips I'm gonna be trying out the nose
I have no idea what the fuck this is
I just not feel it it's cold it's in the
shade under arrest and I just I think
it's silica okay that doesn't not go
with this I look good by that's more
appropriate okay this one is in the
shade called Sunfire
so I'm 99% sure this is just like a
cream lipstick actually sure but I
really do like what it looks like on the
lips okay last but not least I'm gonna
be setting my face now I have used this
all the time but I just wanna give a
special shout-out to urban decay for
customizing this and putting my name on
it how cool is that
sorry I'm just gonna use it because got
a name on it I think that's pretty extra
and I love that
the Spry reminds me of the MELD eyes
because this is the sprite that I was
using 24/7 and that other alcoholic one
but this was like some specific sense
what you just can't forget you know okay
guys so this brings us to the end of
today's video I hope you guys have
really enjoyed it I had definitely
enjoyed sitting down and doing my makeup
considering I haven't put makeup on for
like a very long time well on camera at
least I love you guys to the moon and
back and I will see you all in my next
video bye fucking see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
