some translucent setting powder just to
set that all in the true place now
moving on to your eye shadow we are
using the beauty killer palette today

over my lid just to make sure everything
is going to be blended out perfectly and
then I'm going to be taking the shade

using today I'm leaving the names for
the numbers of them on the screen down

leave them down in the bottom corner
just so you guys know what brushes I'm
using for what now move it on to the
next eyes shadow we are using the UH
Nastasia modern Renee from palette and
I'm just taking it the burgundy pink
shade out of that and pressing that into
my outer V and bringing it through the
hood of my cruise through the crease
I've not said that so long oh my god
anyway so I'm just blending that out and
making it look stunning making sure
there's no harsh edges just blending
everything out now going into this other
like ready source shade I don't think it
showed up it's very well on this
eyeshadow book so I did go in with
another eyeshadow which I'll show you
guys in a second this was makeup geek
listen so I just put a little bit of
that on my how to be I didn't really
want to put black in there because I
wanted to keep it really like Valentine
e like I know making blue black and I
would make it more glam but I don't want
to keep it all pink
because here's one look like they've got
pink eye anyway moving on to a ghoulish
harvest to see to your face
glitter glue so I'm just using a really
small brush to get in there and applying
that almost to the little crease in my
little corded eye and then I'm just
blending it out on the edge now taking
this glitter from OTV
lashes I think it's called my box it
means ages ago

like book attack without it's absolutely
stunning I like to shave name down below

cosmetics black gel liner and I probably
got a frame oh there you go what do you
know thank you so why don't you my
liquid eyeliner I always will gel out
and I always go out of frame and I'm
really sorry but I'm just applying that
and this gel eyeliner is amazing and
this brush is also really good to apply
the eyeliner with so I will be using
that a lot more often just going over
with a few coats of sheer face and
better than sex this is empty I actually
bought a new one yesterday that I have
some protein to use that yes now I'm
just using these lashes from it's all
about makeup in the style GG and I'm
just sticking them on to my sticking
them on to my eyes where am I where else
am I gonna pack a bottom so I'm just
sticking them onto my eyes and then up
we're moving on to the face so for my
primer I'm going to be using the Bobbi
Brown vitamin enriched face today's this
smells like vegan plants smells
absolutely stunning I love it is the
implants able to be I don't know anyway
so I'm just rubbing that all into my
space and foundation we are using Marc
Jacobs remarkable in the shade Oh should
I forget anyway I'm just painting my
entire face with that the coverage on
this foundation is amazing if you guys
don't know already if you haven't been
watching before long this is my holy
grail foundation or one of them I think
I've got three or two but I'm just one
is just amazing because I have oily skin
it's got a matte finish to it so I'm
actually perfect oh so then I'm just
taking that same foundation and
concealing the tops of my eyebrows you
don't even need to use a concealer
foundation is that full coverage you can
just go ahead and do this and then I'm
putting it in the middle of my eyebrows
to get that ombre effect and it just
kind of blends them out really quite
nicely I love this little trick I love
doing it and they're really shown in my
videos don't know why ever they go
anyway then I'm just moving on to the
rest of my forehead and just plastering
that all over my face would basically
turning myself into a cake today which
is me every day when I do wear makeup
and then I'm just taking my damp Beauty
Blender and blending over everything to
make sure everything is seamless there
in our harsh lines or
thing like that ticket still I'm just
using cops shaped cake in light or fair
mutual
I'm not sure Holly the shade down below
and I'm just letting it out with my
ability blender booty blender still that
talk until I turn this together anyway
making sure that's all blended out you
know dial up we're moving on to
under-eye concealer I always put too
much of this part shape tape on it's so
high coverage but I just always put too
much on I do it to myself every single
time and limited always much
wrong it's really annoying but whatever
then I'm just blending that out with my
Beauty Blender and just going over
everything making sure it's all blended
apps before going in with the RCM a
translucent glow color powder and taking
my under eyes hadn't really baked
anything else on my face today oh my god
new favorite translucent powder Oprah
translucent powder in light it's got
like it's translucent but it's got a
warm tinge to it so it kind of gives you
a bit of coverage in a warms up the area
a little bit it's similar to airspun the
curry translucent extra coverage I just
love it so you'll be seeing me use that
I love I do have a discount code for it
but I don't even know like what it is so
if you guys want it let me know and I'll
get it but it's only discount codes out
there for bra but um okay moving on we
are just contouring my face with the
benefits hoola before we bonds because
what I've learned the past couple of
weeks
if you club tour before your bronze your
contour won't go muddy so I'm just
contouring it's my face nice and running
that down the sides of my nose also I'm
not really contouring my nose today I'm
just running it down the sides to bring
it back because it could get a little
bit lost and they can feel like if I put
so much on now the under eye area we're
just going to be taking the modern age
wants palette and we're literally just
using the two shades that we used before
just on these two fluffy brushes and
blending it out it's that easy
I feel like under eyes as far easy to do
because you can literally just do two
colors and it looks amazing it brings
the whole looks together
I think I did take a little bit of
makeup get bitten and put it up against
my lash line as well and then I took the
gels the Mallory cosmetics gel liner
that I used on top of my eye I'm just
taking
in my waterline and then I drew blend
that out with a little tiny brush and a
little bit of makeup geek bitten also
just to smoke that down a little bit you
know I would really I really wanted to
go in more smokey but I just didn't then
I went into the other eye and then I'm
just brushing off my baking powder
because I'm cooked and I'm ready to go

using Pakistan and play are you shocked

bottom lash as I say every video but it
can you hi that's the best mascara for
bottom lashes now for bronzer I'm just
using this Too Faced narrow bunny

luminoso glow in it I guess I don't know

face didn't really like this to be
honest it was the first time using it my
friend gave it to me I wonder why she
gave it to me oh yeah no shade I love
Too Faced so friggin much they have
