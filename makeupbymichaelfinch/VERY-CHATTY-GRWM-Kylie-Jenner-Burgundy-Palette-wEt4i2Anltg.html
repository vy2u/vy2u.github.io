with some people over specific things
that we have in common which was really
really cool so yeah how's that been by

that for a little more like released and
I'm just gonna like blender
like you literally have no idea what I'm
doing so I'm just doing see what happens
however this concealer underneath the
eyeshadow has made a drastic difference
of the eyeshadow I feel like this
concealer is just so good like it
doesn't move once it's set I don't know
maybe it's just me being very dramatic
and so I'm gonna just blend that
through my crease until it's all blended
out I don't know how harsh we're gonna
go today I don't know what we're doing
blend through this ass

no confidence in them or stress they the
 out give me the worst anxiety of
everything I'm just going to take this

this but it literally took so long and I
actually could not stay in the frame
while doing a it took forever anyway
let's move on for my foundation today
I'm going to be using this Melissa
sassing foundation in the shade warm
yellow color shows foundation astray
yellow well wear this foundation is
extremely yellow like I'm talking next
level yellow don't know how it looks on
camera but up in person it's coming up
so yellow and honestly this foundation
smells like ships it actually
smells like and no this was not
said to me I bought it at my mass if I
was ever sent a product that I didn't
like I just simply would not use it I
can't get over how yellow I am
are we going to make this work
Lena how I normally make it work I'm
kind of worried that I won't be able to
make this black but let's just hope for
the best because I'm not
taking it off and putting it back on
again and I know in saying that this
foundation is very yellow I did get the
shade yellow but I didn't think it was
going to come off this yellow oh this is
like a real peanut butter if you guys
don't know there's this mean going
around with me on the Internet's been
going on for like going on sale but um
it's like the peanut butter baby all
grown up which is me so there's like
that before then me after ah so funny oh
shut the up
come holy I'm yellow Oh hopefully
when I can like I literally look like
ever since on my hi what does he do doh
I've got a little bit of hair happening
up here - I'm a very yellow boy now for
my concealer I'm going to be going back
to the shape tape from part hopefully
this fixes the problem that I have going
on here
you know so yesterday I had some clients
that were very important people
I had Jackie gillies from the Real
Housewives of Melbourne I'll insert a
photo here and then I did um Elena from
The Bachelor and you know when you meet
someone from like television or
something you're kind of worried what
they're going to be like they were the
most lovely people I've ever met
slow down to earth now I'm just going to
take my Beauty Blender again give that a
bit of a spritz with some fixed plus a
little bit on the face too because why
not you know okay now I'm just going to
blend this out I probably put way too
much on but are you shocked and you
really shocked them guys look how good
the concealer is it just blends out
doesn't it's not creasing yet yet now to
set that and bake I'm just going to dip
into my cartier spun translucent extra
coverage powder feel like if you inhaled
too much of this you'll die to set the
rest of my foundation I'm just going to
take that airspun and just do like deal
dust off some of this back on my nose
come on Taylor poke down by now to
Bronner's today I'm going to be using
this bronzer from Alfred this is the
versatile matte bronzer I normally use
americano but I want to try this one out
today and see how it goes so I'm at
Rhonda meaning this shouldn't have any
like shimmer to it so it's more of just
a matte bronzer sort of thing
um anyway continuing on before last
thing I went to I'm at it was so much
fun I've already said that let's move
along
we went out clubbing we went to our I
think that's our only club we went to

muddy probably is muddy - probably match
my hands then so yeah but she rock was
so much fun
I got way too drunk like way too drunk
