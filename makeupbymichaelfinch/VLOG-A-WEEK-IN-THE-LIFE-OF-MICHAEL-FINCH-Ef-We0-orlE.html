little bit of the simple life and Lilly
is editing over there eating popcorn and
I'm gonna go put a face mask on and I

series which is really really cool to me
it's like a youtuber made me buy it like
a full-face so he's doing
nikkietutorials made me buy it
that's his channel there go check it I
so talented so pretty much all he does
is he uses all these products that
nikkietutorials has made him by saying
whether they're good or if they're

cool concept for a video idea okay

not what to keep and like give away to
my friends and stuff cause like I
literally never go in this drawer and
there's so much and I need to go through

through this and pray for me and then
all the makeup over here is like stuff
that I still need to use all by the way
this is a makeup bag everyone who
attends my master class will be getting
how bougie is this I love it yes alright
so I literally just tried to start
sorting this out and I'm not joking I
don't know what to do like I literally
don't know what to do I think I'm just
gonna get like a bunch of containers to
fit in here perfectly and put them all
intersections of the ones that I want to
keep but like what are your mom okay
guys it has been
an eventful afternoon but it's been so
good my pre to a merge drop just
happened and we sold out within an hour
just so cool I love you guys so much to
anyone who bought my merch thank you so

there could be a second job there might
not be I don't really know what's going
on at the moment but yeah thank you so
much to everyone who bought it I
literally just wrapped up I okay I
reorganized my filming room hence why
I'm really red and like flustered and
sweaty because I just vacuumed I'm like
I'll show you I'll show you so this is
the filming room now this bed is so ugly
but people always stay over almost every
night so I'll just be a pain to blow it
up and then take it down blow it up take
it down but it's pissing me off I need a
bigger apartment Wow
anyway I changed you a yellow background
we're gonna see how this color grows I
need to get some more colors and yeah
this is this and then we have a
fest on the carpet this was not me this
was one of my friends I had tried so
hard not to get anything on the carpet
since the day I moved in and I was
succeeding until this happens so I need
to get the carpet professionally cleaned
because I don't want to touch it because
it'll probably just make it worse so I
need to get it professionally clean and
if it stains don't come out that I'm
gonna have to replace all the
carpet in this room before I
move so anyway guys I'm gonna end
today's vlog here but I will see all of
you guys in at the morning so have an
awesome night actually no you won't have
an awesome night because you probably
watching this in the afternoon I'll see
you guys in the money hey good morning
guys so it is now the next day and I'm
ready to get into my vlogging for today
now today it's not gonna be very
exciting but hopefully it is because I
literally cannot leave my house because
of the reason that I'm waiting for my
iPhone X to be delivered today and I
need it before we go to Hong Kong on
Saturday so it's meant to come today
it's expressed post I was promised to
get it yesterday by Australia Post and
of course it didn't come because there

get it and also I've got a parcel coming
from DHL that I've been trying to get
for the past three days but I've been

to deliver it and it's a package from
