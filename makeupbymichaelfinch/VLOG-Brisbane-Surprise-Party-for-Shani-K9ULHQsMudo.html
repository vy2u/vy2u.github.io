now let me she's like backrubs sometimes
oh my god you guys I literally just did
you do this this is how I like the whole
beating like a baby
mmm ah love you but I literally just had
the most Bruce Weber a delivery guy ever
had I was like you know how do we breach
you can write like come to what level
and come to what floor and like do this
and do that he literally didn't do
anything and he got out the elevator and
literally just gave me my bags would
look she like have a good day and turned
around and went back in the elevator I
was like can you write people and herb
rates because he's going to get a zero
home so we have BBQ pork and rice and
from slaughter a chicken so I'm going to
go on devour this because I'm
starving and you're gonna help me this
gonna help Benny you're gonna help eat
dudes are you gonna help we do
so you mean they're going to go have a
mum and I might watch some Netflix and
then we'll come into your waiter so by
then
oh okay guys so I thought I should do a
little bit other vlog I've just got beam
be chilling down there and okay guys
it's a little bit of a haul I went to
Daiso which is like a really cheap shop
pretty much I bought a lot of their
brush cleaners I think I got one two
three four five six
only seven bottles because I don't have
died so where I live and then I got
these eyebrow raises here which are just
for like cleaning up a little bit
they're perfect
I used to use them all the time but
they're so handy and I finally found
them again then I popped into lush and
got to my favorite skin cleanser at the
moment it is the angels on bare skin oh
my God look at my tan bye facial
cleanser it is so good and it does not
break me out which I love my channel
 disgusting look I'm actually
done with fake tan for good thank you
then I took a little trip to Mecca
Maxima and I got two things so I finally
got a two-faced better than Sigma scar I
thought I'd get this just because my
other one I have had for a very long
time and you are men to replace your
mascaras after a while and then I got
these sweet peach glow palette and I
really want to smell this so I'm going
to smell it right now cuz when to smell
like fujas I was going to get the
eyeshadow palette but I just didn't
because well I probably use it once I
never used again so this is the gorge
orange packaging I think it's stunning
and then we have the highlighters and
here let's do a little squatchy squatchy
think you are they're very creamy oh
this is going to be stunning these are
the swatches on my arm I think they're
showing up very well but I feel like
this whitish one here on the end is
going to be my absolute favorite so yes
that's that and then I went into cotton
on and oh my god I feel like so many
people are going to judge me for this
spot uh-huh it's just fashion it's
fashion apparently according to my
little group of haters I have the worst
fashion ever so thank you this will just
add to it which will be stunning so I
bought this really long shirt
at all tea and then oh my god I got a
Guns N'Roses shirt never have I ever
listened to Guns and Roses once in my
life so don't like turn around and try
and ask me what my favorite Guns &amp;amp; Roses
song is because I don't know any
but I just think the pattern is
absolutely stunning and actually had my
side thorns which is triple XL but
because nothing ever fits me in
these chain stores so they finally had
that so they're probably still be too
tight on me I don't know so I'm going to
end this vlog but you smell like dog
through I just fed her and she smells
like oh my god yuck I'm going to end
this vlog here and I will start blogging
tomorrow hopefully I can still surprise
SHINee and I'm going to vlog the
surprise party tomorrow night too so
should be really excited to you
I'm so excited okay goodnight guys oh
good buddy um so I just woke up probably
half an hour guard Vinny coming up thank
you
oh we have been a we have Benny sorry I
just ordered some ubereats because I'm
sorry hungry and a copy going
anywhere I'm sorry I'm late for that and
I need to feed you don't I

ever cuz I shall queue so this is my
breakfast I'm literally full already

are shocked and if you're my friend and
you're watching this you're probably
thinking wow you're not bald you're just
lying now I'm actually cool thank you so
update unfortunately shiny knows I'm
here now I was just on FaceTime with her
and um she just knows because the text
message is just there but she has no
idea about tonight the only way she's
going to find out about tonight earlier
is if she watches this vlog on my camera
like if she takes my camera and watches
I'm like what are you talking about
that's the only way she's gonna know
she's not finding out okay
so when you watch this stop asking
questions and stop trying thank you so
I'm currently just editing onto this
videos

Chinese microphones I think here I want
to show you guys this I just got this
brush holder like a brush set from a
brand called sells cosmetics the other
day I just actually worked on this
Valentine's Day look with them for that
video so that will be up before after
this I don't even know and then I've
just got all my regular brushes here
about this brush holder is so good
because you just close it BAM and then
you stick this thing on and it's all
done thank you this full face here we
hope you guys all this works for that
intro that you guys just saw on Manny's
video I actually tracked that guy down
and I'm getting him to make my new intro
for me so it should it's going to take a
few weeks probably like three or four
weeks because his schedule is sorry busy
as you can imagine like the talent in
that intro is amazing so it won't be I
won't be used like getting even like
