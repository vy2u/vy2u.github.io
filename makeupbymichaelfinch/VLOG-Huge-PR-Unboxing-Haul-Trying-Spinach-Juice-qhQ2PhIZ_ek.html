channel so today's vlog is just gonna be
like a PR unboxing haul
I've got a lot of products that I need
to show you guys and just do a PR
unboxing haul because I haven't really
done one of these on my channel before
it's gonna be like a vlog sort of style
video before I go any further I just
wanna say that this video is sponsored
by best themed so for those who don't
know best fiends is a adventure puzzle
game where you can collect fiends
and you pretty much just have to match
up the same colored objects in order to
defeat the slugs now I have been playing
this is so long and I'm currently on a
level 160 the thing I like about this
the most is that you don't have to have
a Wi-Fi when you're doing it so if
you're up in the air like you're on a
plane and you don't have to have Wi-Fi
in order to play it which is so good
because honestly the best time to play
is when you're traveling and you don't
have any Wi-Fi so this month they're
doing a little thing where you can play
at the Valentine's Day challenge in
order to win massive prizes on the app
including a new character called Rose
the orchard amount s now if you guys are
interested in playing this make sure you
use my download link below you can
download the game for free it is free
that's even better
sorry if you guys want to download this
game for free and make sure you click
the link down below and if you use my
link you will get $5 worth of gold and
diamonds for free so that's pretty much
everything for me and let's get straight
into the flock I hope you guys enjoy
I'll go sit here for a second just tell
you guys oh oh so basically what's
happening is main shani are going to the
Maldives and we leave tonight at like
11:30 and we're going on a trip that
would benefit I'm so excited it's like

being invited to an actual brand trip so
super super proud of myself for that

days and I'm going to head straight to
further afterwards for my purple
masterclass but right now I have you
guys sitting on a massive stack of
parcels and I thought I might just open
them up on camera cuz I haven't done it

spring 2018 so we have some of the blush
palette and also some where the jeweler

last time I use them so maybe they've
changed the formula probably not and
they're gonna be the same thing but

so nice I might give one of these away
in a giveaway because I probably don't
want both of them and that's the other

this to you guys is my this is like nice
this is like the little slip here being
gay is like the best roller coaster ride
I've ever been on the realisation of my
sexuality wasn't a sudden awakening
there was no revelation that I suddenly
like boys thinking back to my childhood
I was a pretty queer kid
Touche sis but it wasn't until high
school that I that I ever put
label on what I felt same I was getting
called back a bag and like a poof and I
was just denying at my whole primary
school because I didn't really know like
what it was does that make sense well
the idea of finding the perfect man and
settling down excited me I guess I
always thought life as a gay man would
be so hard so I avoided it ah but that
perception changed instantly when I
found a little shop in my mall called
lush I applied for a job and upon being
hired I decided that in his new
beginning I would totally be upfront
about who I was no more hiding for the
first time I confidently comfortably
told people that I was gay so the first
time I was accepted without question for
the first time I felt pride oh that's so
cute I love when brands like all in on
this LGBTQ like pride and stuff like
that that makes me happy okay

what's in here beautiful my mom would
die over this box should be like look
