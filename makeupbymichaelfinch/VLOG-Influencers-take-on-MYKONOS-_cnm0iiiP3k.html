$2,000 because everything's so expensive
I probably spent $2,000 on like a shirt
I haven't really thought much today
because I've just got some personal
stuff going on at the moment and like
I'm just like as much as I want to vlog
like I'm just not
thinking about it like all and like I
don't want to talk about it because it's
not really something that I should be
making like public just for other
people's like personal privacy do you
know what I mean yeah I don't really
know like how to feel like or anything I
just don't know what to do I don't know
like I have so many people to talk to
yeah but like how to start like talking
about my problems with anyone because I
don't know I just get really awkward and
just like I don't know I just don't want
to put my problems on other people do
you know what I mean so I'd rather just
sit in my room and talk to a camera the
past like 24 hours like the past like
nine hours has been literally immersed
 eyeball like I don't know I
don't know what I don't know what to do
I don't even know what to say but I'm

I mean like I just want to go to dinner
tonight with everyone and stuff but like
I literally had two drinks at lunch and
like what I drink alcohol I got really
emotional everyone wants to get like
blackout drunk tonight and go to dinner
but honestly like I don't even want to
go to dinner I didn't even think I'm
what a guy was gonna sit in my room and
dwell because like I'm just letting the
merge and I when you not in the mood and
you just got other going on and you
just don't want to talk to anyone or
communicate with any other form of the
human race you'd rather just sit here
and talk to a camera that's literally me
right now anyway I'm gonna stop talking
about negative stuff because this is
that positive place here on my channel
but letting you all know that I go
through personal struggles as well I'm a
real human I'm just a boy who sits down
in front of a camera and films videos I
don't even know what I'm talking about
right now but I'm gonna open up my
suitcase and see what the is or can
any I'm sorry freaking terrified because
