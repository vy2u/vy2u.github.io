today I'm going to be vlogging over the
next few days I'm just in the car with
miss Lilly and we have a lot to do I
mean like I have a lot to do do you have
a lot to do yeah I do
boy I'm really very start right now it's
gonna have to I have to go and pick up a
parcel that I've got at the post office
and then we're gonna go to super a mark
because I'm changing my couch over
because the one I've got right now so
uncomfortable and ugly I only bought it
because I thought it looked really busy
but it's actually so uncomfortable so
they're taking it back which is amazing
they're taking it back and they're gonna
bring a new one over so that should be
pretty good
and then we I have an eyebrow
appointment at two o'clock to get my
brows done and my lashes done so by the
way I'm using Lily's vlogging camera
that's why there's a filter on it
because I mean I don't need filters but
you've decided to turn it on so oh my
god I'm scared I'm scared yeah right I'm
still such a you guys like I can't
deal with wax in my you know
the orange tulip ratan in the makeup bag
so then I think it's
oh my god this filter is too much Wow
hello guys sir it is the next day now I
didn't end up looking anything else
yesterday because me and Lilly just got
so busy and hectic with everything
Lilly I'm hating this filter so much it
just airbrushes okay cool no ways I just
filmed a full face of first impressions
and another video and now Lilly is about
to film and I need to film trim more
videos today hopefully if I can if I
don't get too lazy but I really want to
do it because he just feels so good when
you film and just like pumpkin like
continuously pumping out videos it's the
best feeling ever for lunch me and Lilly
had you Foods I had the Thai green curry
and she had some yaki was it young was
okay yeah yeah I loved you feel like
your braids great the Thai green curry
was the best you fish is what I've been
eating for so long and then I also went
got my hair done today and I got some
more products I got the day Lorenzo
hairspray this is like a treatment that
goes in your hair and this is a dry
shampoo I love Tyler ENSO like it's so
good I also got more of the conditioner
because I've just run out and then I got
the shampoos yes and then we also have
the texture spray which is so good
because it gives your hair texture it
makes a look awesome and I also just got
in the post this package from huda
beauty so pretty much what happened was
I bought a shade and the primer and
whatnot because I thought that I was
gonna be kicked off the PR list
afterwards making a negative review
about the desert dust palette but turns
out not because they emailed me and said
we'll send you some shades of the
foundation that are actually yours and
in here we have two shades of foundation
at the primer and the brush so huge
respect to huda beauty for and her team
for sending that to me especially after
I did a negative review I wasn't
expecting this so I'm super happy about
that and a lot of respects for you and
your team Han and can we just take a
moment to appreciate this this is
everything
what are you doing in here soldier
soldier soldier away you're the soldier
you're a con dog so this is pretty much
my YouTube room I haven't really ever
shown this before but this is it like
there's a spare mattress here this is
all this makeup in here all this here is
what I haven't ever used before and this
is for full face the first impressions
this is high end and this is drugstore
here this room's a bit of a mess at the
moment like I mean Lily left it chewing
on an eyelash case like no worries I
just filmed two videos so that is the
ruckus from over there are you gonna
move all that other way or you just
going to do your Q&amp;amp;A yeah cool yeah of
course and this is my background so I
just use paper like it looks so
deceiving when you see it on camera but
really it's just like wow don't quit
ginseng it yeah I'll kill you
cuz you know how hard it is to do that
 reckless oh here is another box
down here we have four full face the
first impressions which will be coming
at soon the Laura Mercier foundation
I've got to send the other day and I'm
so excited to try it out and also there
is an eyeliner in here from NARS that
mecha yeah oh my god this one looks
amazing so I can't wait to try that out
and then we have the prism palette from
Anastasia Beverly Hills I ordered this
when it came out and I just haven't got
around to trying it so we'll do that
soon and then also here we have these
are my background so I just get
photography paper for any people who
want to start YouTube or anything like
that this is pretty much it I just get
the paper from the website it's just a
random website from Australia it's like
I think it's a hundred and twenty
dollars a roll but you get a lot and
then you just put it up and then yeah
that's it there's a yellow one there too
that I haven't actually used yet and
then we've just got two lights here it's
a bit like dramatic to have to but I
like to because Lily smashed one of my
lights the other week so I have to buy a
whole new set I just get these sets from
eBay they're literally $120 comes with
all the globes and everything and
they're actually so good this one is
just a bit you know dramatic and extra
this one just belongs just behind here
to give a little bit more light on the
forehead you know then we've got just a
ring light and then we've got my camera
a film with thee
what's this camera called
canon 70d and then i've got a lens on
top of that this and the lenses like
everything because the auto focus is on
whatnot but it does make a creaking
sound hence why I used a microphone
which is the zoom h5 in my video
everyone's coming at me you're like
that yeah what the is that noise
and then just quickly up here we have
just some of my fave new liquid
lipsticks and glosses and then there's
just a bunch of random everywhere
this is just like liners and stuff like
that and then in this one we have lashes
and then this one we have this is story
messy guys I'm so sorry this is
highlighters and stuff but honestly
everything's in every single drawer like
it's all mixed up these are contours
bronzers and blushes these are setting
powders translucent powders and then in
here we have concealers foundation and
whatnot and then in here we have just a
bunch of lipsticks that I don't know
what to do with them like I need to sort
them out and go through them and give
some to my friends because I'm never
gonna use all these so they just kind of
pile up over time here we have setting
sprays and some serums and then in this
one we just have some eye shadow
palettes in this one we have face
palettes and eyeshadow palettes and and
then it's fun in this one we have more
eye shadow palettes and whatnot ooh my
toes were in that that's disgusting by
people fate wow you're a bitch and then
the other day I got these color pop
concealers to my Pierre box so I can't
wait to try these out because I've heard
really good things and I did swatch it
on my hand pretty good coverage you know
kill you leave us a comment below should
me and Michael move in together
 no this is I just used this orange
shadow so there was one from a Natasha
and ona palette that sucked ass so I
just picked this one up instead and this
is so pigmented like you'd love it this
one here
back it's that's pretty these both these
I turn the palette upside down in this
one here and this one here fell out they
literally fell out the palette I was
like oh yeah

Oh myoh on maybe I should Bank and put
some plates on you and just give it a
quick you know quick quickie I don't
think I could ever move in with you I'm
being serious like I feel like would
just kill each other probably chop each
other's heads off okay well I'm not a
dramatic person so take a step back okay
I need you to take a step back
reevaluate your whole life to the right
tree sit back again and now you're
taking this a little 8 steps not just
white 5 minutes of your time so once
you're caught with turn your page and
three you've got my breasts well I know
that I'm gonna pay but I am fat I'm just
going to go and edit my videos that I
just filmed my Lilly's filming in there
so we like to kind of take it in turns
it's good so another thing I just want
to show you guys while I'm here these
are the Nature's Way hair skin and nails
or vitae Cummings for adults
please are very flavored and you can
literally just devour them this is what
they look like today
so pretty much all these gummies do you
guys is they just promote a really
healthy hair skin and nails so it just
helps them grow better I guess I've been
eating them for literally like four
months now you guys know I'd never like
responses by anything that I didn't
truly believe in and they taste really
good too
sir I'm gonna have a few more I think
you probably six containers of these
that hopefully would die
there's also collagen production so they
help the collagen in your skin as well
which is always good because they don't
need to go by time I mean I will anyway
but like you don't have to you know what
I mean
this rate has made the biggest mess I
just wanted to show you guys this and I
think I've ever shown you guys oh maybe
I have in a vlog anyway if you need
welcome a beautiful girl from Melbourne
her name is Emily in ham I think I
pronounced that right I leave her
Instagram on the screen right now should
read this with me and bindi and I still
need to get it for him because I want to
put it up somewhere and it's so nice but
it just sits here and I looking at every
single day because honestly that looks
so much like me it's like it's ident and
look at being like look at a
little buck teeth coming through like a
so guys Lily's Lily is currently filming
I'm gonna go in there and just scary cuz
that's what we always do
oh shut the up you boring yes
scaring me because literally my heart
races for about 20 minutes off do you do
that do you know that do you seriously
know that like I'm not kidding
I was literally asleep and I was so
 tired and you came out and
screamed at me and my heart was racing
for twenty minutes I couldn't stop
shaking in so for the chair no no
well that went well didn't it
I've got sorry much washing to do oh my
god

okay this is all the washing
that I have to do what I hate not living

driver that's like a plus okay sorry I'm
currently just in my bathroom and I'm
gonna take this makeup off cuz I do need
to film another video whether I will oh

flowers right now
Wow alright so I just took all my makeup
off and I'm just going to show you guys
like my basic skincare routine I'm not
gonna do it but I'm just going to show
you guys what I use because well a lot
of you guys do ask me so just to take
off all my makeup I just use the touch
of pure one-step Camila cleansing oil
this is just an oil that gets off all
your makeup and it's so good because it
literally gets everything off okay sir
and then in here I just have like when I
need a full-on hydration
moment I will use the lemare moisturizer
and I'll let that sink into my skin or
overnight we have some face masks and
then I like to use this as well this is
by a aside this is the pure hydration
concentrate it's really really good and
then we just got some hair up there
that's pretty much it I just put like
oils on my skin and really thick
moisturizers and they don't break me out
which is fabulous you know so I mean
literally I'm not doing much for the
rest of the day we're kind of just
chilling out so I'm gonna wrap this vlog
