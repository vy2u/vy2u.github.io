hi Wow Wow
you need to stop think and pause cuz I
have had enough why is your tongue so
long hon she loves it
 she'd suck a good dick hey at that
tongue some indie indie about you Andy
what have you done I'm gonna I'm gonna
picture wow you look very Betty oh hello
she's gonna turn around and turn out I
didn't want to dent the ranging Lily
this is the worst road I could go down
ever this is a dead end to you dog
 now so we are just going where
are we right I've gone from country road
and a lot of cars a lot of
 lanes a lot of fuckwits
I can't deal it's too much you stop
telling me to stop when there's a stop
sign because I way signing you
just asked me to stop so shut up and I'm
telling you what you told me to stop it
it to give way sign we're like oh my god
oh my god
sorry about that before the camera was
completely cooked and I can't find my
charger for my camera that's why I am
using Lily's right now but we have
exactly the same camera so there should
be anything to different about this vlog
but um let's figure the deaf Dev
I got it working out of a manual focus
well good luck keeping it up there cuz
if you break it you're buying
everyone all right did I make you buy a
new YouTube lights when you smash them
know I've had by for a whole new set
camera shut up
get me something are you serious my ass
hurts you're gonna have a car or did you
actually not get me anything you have
one of those you can have one of those
what the is that
and you alive and you've just decided to
put me in this car today and I've
literally been scared for my life don't
know why before the boss the reality I
don't know why because I'm gonna drive
it in Lille I think in use need to take
you're not gonna be able to eat all that
that's why I got them I'm not touching
your which hand recharges 40
cents for mayonnaise actually pretty
good deal for all that Mayo I would
expect you like a little PC
piece of mayonnaise you know
those little tomato sauce things that
you squirt onto a sausage roll these
like they charge me 40 cents out earn
I'm like 20 cents is acceptable 25
pushing it 30s to March 40 is just not
okay
40 is yeah you can't have your sausage
yeah the half a tin sausage drawback but
I've already taken about into because I
was so hungry I just couldn't wait yeah
and you can stick it up your ass
yes I'm not paying 40 cents it's
ridiculous in there it's full of it half
of its air anyway but however 40
cents is a bargain so much I'm
gonna say that's a bag every day
is a blessing at the same time it's a
risk going for a walk as a risk you
never know what can happen never stopped
you from living alive ya know a hundred
percent but I'm just saying you're risk
taking every day
Johnny
I'm gonna be able to get over there with
your head in the way and what if anyone
ever says I want to be friends with
Michael take it back
but boss you work bitch good morning
everyone so it is now the next day and
I'm just putting around my house trying
to get organized for Sunday if someone
is staring at me I will literally
obliviate them because I've had enough
anyway so today I'm just gonna be
getting organized for Sunday so Sunday
is my master class in Brisbane hence all
these boxes over here and we've also got
all of these boxes over here too this is
all the sponsors and whatnot it's just
here because it's all being delivered
here also I just wanted to show you guys
this amazing painting that Emily in Ham
had made for me I asked her to do a
photo of me and shiny because I wanted
it to put above my couch I just need to
go and get it framed but it is so
amazing so incredible Instagram right
here or here don't know but um it's so
beautiful and it's so big too because I
really wanted a big one and she
personally delivered it to me yesterday
I was gonna vlog but I totally forgot to
vlog anything yesterday afternoon I was
so exhausted and there's another little
painting that we have here that's also
very very cute then that came frame I
got given that at my Sydney masterclass
I'm pretty sure it's so cute I also got
given it this at my Sydney masterclass
as well it's a framed photo of being god
bless now today I also should be getting
my Cartier bracelet that I've wanted for
so long so incredibly long I've been
saving so hard for it really should have
bought a car but instead I got a
bracelet but that's just me that's just
what I do
that's just like why am i shaking so
much holy I'm also very pale at the
moment as you could probably tell it
just because I have scrubbed all my tan
off because I'm tanning tonight so it's
nice and fresh
the Sunday and um yeah I just gotta load
of washing on that I need to put some in
the dryer and hang some hat and then I
have to go to the airport pick up mayor
cuz me is coming today and yeah I
haven't actually driven by myself in
Brisbane yet so I'm a little bit nervous
and I'm probably gonna crash but it's
John's all cost like he doesn't really
care this is when you know you
addiction Balenciaga texted me from the
Melbourne started that they have more
lack of any shoes coming in and see if I
wanted any because I sell out so quick
but almost like Mary they're not really
my style but thanks for letting me know
okay so this whole vlogging situation
isn't going to work with the camera
because it's just not saying there it's
not gonna work
so I'll vlog when I'm at the airport
because Helen ah hey guys so rerun two
two and a half three days later because
I'm terrible of vlogging and you
guys all saw how the clip in the car
went with the camera sticking on at the
dashboard Lily it was fast but today is
the Masterclass it's literally about 65
degrees outside and this is the only day
you will ever see me wear makeup on a
day like today where I absolutely have
to and I'm sweating up a storm
sorry we're about to leave now we're
getting into the uber and then of luck
when I'm there oh and by the way Queen
Dee's coming today no one knows
so me and Lily are just currently
sitting in this room
sorry we were just really interested but
like me and Lily I sit up well by the
way you guys guess who's coming today
and everybody knows bindi is making an
appearance after the lunch break and I'm
gonna vlog that I'm a little bit nervous
though because Ben he doesn't do very
well with crowds so I have to tell
everyone to be really quiet because she
like if she freaks out and she might try
and like grab someone's ankles with
their teeth not she white there's no
line how but yeah I'm gonna vlog when I
walk out onto the stage and show you
guys everything and I'll probably get me
it to vlog a little bit as well and like
I'll vlog during the show and just like
little fun things we do so I hope you
guys enjoy um all right they're mine in
my house
Weaver no I want to well I would like
one well I'm sorry but it's not
happening
looks like a little boy okay guys so
this is the stage my makeups all setup
up there pretty much we still have to do
some rearranging and these girls hi guys
these guys are helping out put the media
wall together is it harder is easy it's
good it's not it's not fitting ah like
you've got to stretch it yeah well yeah
wait I want to see the tape going to it
go go do it again I love the lighting in
here it's very what does this remind me
of yeah definitely
why do you make me do stupid things and
then I break my thing you are the one
who walked out of there picked up a pair
of tongs stuck your tongue out and
pretended to bite it trying to be funny
and then you dropped them and then steps
on them I think that's hilarious did
that happen they're fully four okay
hello
all right Wow can you smile at least
this is the second look I know sorry
I've had the fan on the whole entire
time this is the second look done oh
yeah if you want to look down low again
yeah just got everyone up here taking
you some photos hi guys
hey guys sir it is the next day right
now I didn't get to vlog much of the
master class and I even wanted to give
my vlog camera to people in the audience
that I could vlog like and like talk
about the master class and stuff but I
totally forgot to do that and it was the
best idea and everyone was so excited
for it so if you're watching this and he
came to the Brisbane master class I'm
really sorry I totally forgot to do that
I would have loved to have done it it
would have been so cool I'm probably
gonna do it at my next master class if
people have the guts to like vlogging
stuff like that
yesterday was a complete success I had
so much fun and so did Lilly
everyone was so lovely and incredible I
don't know I just have the best time
when I do these master classes and
they're just so like entertaining and
people always say that they learn heaps
of which is the whole point of it
and that always makes me feel good
because I feel like they're getting
their money's worth if they learn stuff
and they leave knowing that they've
learnt things I'm not sure so I'm just
going over some photos and just
paintings and lettuce that some of you
guys had given me yesterday this is one
of the drawings that got done I think
it's historical it's literally perfect
like y'all are so talented I
can't even breathe and also I've still
got this one here um this was done for
Lilly I'm pretty sure by the same girl
um that's what it looks like the
lighting in here is just with my
 anyway this is incredible like that
literally looks exactly like Lilly like
what the
so we have them and then we have a bunch
of lettuce here I've already read at
least four of them I just want to read
you guys a few I'm not gonna be saying
names or anything like that just because
they might not want to read out on
camera I'll read you guys this one dear
Michael I want to thank you for
everything you have done for everyone
especially me
you have taught me to be confident and
proud of Who I am even though I don't
look like Kendall Jonna
your constant love and acceptance of
those around you inspires me to love and
cherish the people I would usually take
for granted oh thank you for constantly
inspiring me to pursue my dreams in
makeup and beauty I cannot explain to
you how much I am grateful and blessed
to have you as an influence on my life
to make mine a million times better
that's so sweet
I have only been watching you for three
oh my god three years I have only been
watching needs to fit that's a lot of
time whoa
but your positive attitude towards on
life and the energy you have in your
videos always makes me happy and never
fail to make me laugh I wish you all the
happiness in 2018 and I hope that that
is and hope that it is absolutely as
stunning as you rock on oh my god that's
so sweet
how these are like I feel like when you
read letters from like subscribers and
stuff like some of them like they really
hit home for you like you just don't
know what they're gonna say
or like have helped your anything like
that so you have to like mentally
prepare yourself to read them I'm just
gonna read another one do you Michael
thank you for absolutely everything not
only are you an icon thank you for the
makeup industry but you have made an
influence on Who I am today
and I'm sure many others agree after
struggling with depression and anxiety
or videos your videos were always there
to calm me and to that I'm forever
grateful thank you once again for
everything and being an amazing person
you know what it makes me so happy that
if people are feeling down if they've
got anxiety if they've got depression
the fact that people who can just come
over to my channel and watch my videos
and it makes them feel better it might
even make them smile is what I do what I
do because I feel like if you can make
someone smile you've made someone happy
and I love making people laugh I love
making people smile I love making people
happy I love making people feel
confident I love helping people get
through tough times in their life too
you know what I mean like it sounds deep
but that's what I do what I do that's
why I'm here today anyway so what I'm
gonna do now is just kind of clean up my
house I really want to watch jaclyn
hills best of beauty 2017 video yeah I'm
probably gonna drag this log on for a
few more days because I do have quite a
bit to do so yeah hello guys but I just
filmed two new videos and
my skin's a little bit red and there's
some left over on my eyes and my
eyebrows but I just ordered lunch I just
bought it as Emperor arrows because I
haven't had an in so long and it's like
the healthiest thing I could find on her
brakes cause it can't be cooking
and I also just got a package from Tasha
it's a race book of everything that I
love I love them like this is
awesome
I'm so happy Thank You cha-cha love you
so much sorry this is the background
that I've done it looks so cute
these are leftover flowers from the
Brisbane master class so I thought may
as well put them to good use their
low-key half-dead but they still look
good and they just blossomed this
morning I think and they look absolutely
stunning this is what it looks like on
the camera so it looks pretty nice I
swear you guys always end up on the
floor I'm gonna make it I started I
always end up on the floor when I'm in
my kitchen I'm gonna make this movie um
you can what she done okay so what I use
is this almond milk just by pure harvest
I just use a frozen banana and then some
of the babies peanut better way Dan
I need to get a little claws shits got
no water in it ah that could be bad
bindi very common both of waiting
Pratt's a coffee machine and then I'll
just grab a coffee pod let's just go
luck at the door okay and here's just
one here I haven't tried this one I
don't think anyway it's goes into their
own then that does it's magic now let's
get started on this I need to get the
dishwasher and I've got a nice clean
blender thing I just like to put a
little bit of ice in it so it's not as
hot and makes the smoothie warm because
that would be absolutely broke
everything else can off okay so
he's out Irma's gonna put everything in
and then drop it and then it's Jam gel
then I was chucking a strongbox you
 uncle death which is like a
million flavors all at the same time but
it actually has lit okay so I just
finished filming a vid
rocked up mid filming sorry this is the
completed look
I'm not gonna tell you guys what it is
just yet but it'll be up on my channel
after this vlog I was often pretty sure
right so this is a blush bouquet wow the
packaging is so extra so this is what
they all look like I'll probably only
use yeah that one and that one you can
have that one I don't want that one I'll
get that time she'll love that
okay perfect but not the back wrap that
not the right back so yeah I'm gonna use
these because they're super pretty so
thank you eh
okay so I also wanted to show you guys
this ring light which I'm actually in
love with this is a new desktop ring
light from ring light selfie and you can
actually turn up the exposure so if it's
true bright in your eyes you can turn it
all the way down like that or all the
way up and it plugs into the wall I've
got this plugged in just under here and
it's got the longest cord ever and it
actually packs a range like this little
tiny bag so you can take it when you go
traveling it's the best if you are
coming to my master class ring light
selfie is giving everybody a little
iPhone ring light not this big one here
but they're giving everyone like one of
the little iPhone ring lights so this is
the same brand as that here it is still
so literally when my friends come over
they want to do their makeup and I need
my makeup room this is what they use not
in there thank you take note so next
time you join your makeup here little
okay guys so I just finished off my
makeup I just filmed another video

gonna be shook to the core so look out
