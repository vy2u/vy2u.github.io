channel so today I'm gonna be doing a
super highly requested video so today
I'm gonna be reviewing the supposed
world's fullest coverage foundation this
is the a derma call film studio makeup
cover foundation now this is in the
shade oh I don't even know it
doesn't even say on here I don't know
anyway I look on my emails to get the
receipt and leave the color shade at
down below and on the string right now
if you are interested this shade is a
little bit dark for me so I did put a
little bit of tan on my neck so
hopefully it matches up pretty well so
just a little bit about this foundation
pretty much it is meant to be the
world's full of coverage foundation so
today I'm gonna be putting it to the
test and who knows I could be finding a
new favorite foundation today so let's
get straight into this video
okay guys so just before I apply
foundation I'm just gonna apply a primer
as I normally would I'm just gonna be
taking the maybelline baby skin primer
oh I don't even know so I can take
a little bit of that and I'm gonna just
whack it on already done my eyebrows to
just like look a little bit more
presentable you know what I'm saying
okay now for the foundation what I'm
gonna do is go on with my Beauty
Blender BRB
everyone's gonna be sugar that I
actually just got off my fat off to
literally wet my actual Beauty Blender
that is not a problem okay so this is a
nice wet fresh Beauty Blender right here
so what I'm gonna do is like how I
normally do my foundation so I'm just
going to take a regular foundation brush
and I'm gonna squirt some of this on the
back of my hand oh my god it's so that
actually looks like bindi are you
actually serious oh my goodness okay so
it is very thick from what I can
see that actually looks like a piece of
poo that is not a problem hopefully
doesn't look like actual sheet on my
face
wow it is so sore thick whoa okay oh
okay don't okay don't so what I'm gonna
do is I'm just gonna stop how
Mike Jacobs what huh see ya wouldn't
want to be ya I'm just this is literally
the thing that I'm not lacking about
this already as it feels sorry thick on
your skin and it really feels like
you've got a thick layer of makeup one
well that's because I do now I'm just
gonna take my Beauty Blender and I'm
gonna see how this blends out Wow okay
it is definitely the fullest coverage
concealer I think I've ever used in my
extra life
are you guys like seeing this okay so
it's literally covering everything quite
easily to be honest this is the problem
so I'm just gonna keep doing the rest of
my face the reason why I'm wearing a hat
is cuz my hair is an actual man so need
to actually get all that actual grace
out of it you guys this is literally
made my skin look flawless like are you
seeing this right now I'm literally just
using what's left over from the Beauty
Blender to do all this part and it's
still giving me a lot of protein
do it okay Wow that is all I can say so
the amount that I scored it on to my
hand I didn't even use half of that and
this is what my face looks like now what
I'm gonna do to set everything in place
to see how it sets is I'm just gonna
take the Australis so I'm gonna I that's
a problem Oh
take the Australis fresh and flawless
pressed powder in the shade darkest
Brown and I'm just gonna set everything
to see how it all sets and then I'm
gonna give you guys a full-on closeup of
this makeup I'm not gonna conceal just
cuz I really want to see how the
foundation goes actually I can feel
closed up before I said all right so
this is what the foundation looks like
up close
super full coverage it feels very heavy
as well which I don't like but I mean
what else to expect with a full
coverage foundation bin huh
huh right so now I'm just gonna set
everything just to see how everything
sitting Wow
this foundations super good so it's
setting a super super well nothing's
moving or coming off as I'm setting
everything in place which I'm super
super super impressed about I just can't
believe how full coverage is is okay now
that all my foundation is set doesn't
feel secure anything okay now I'm gonna
give you guys a full-on closeup of this
foundation so you can super suss it all
out alright so this is what I'm dealing
with you guys I'm like I'm amazed I'm so
amazed this has covered everything like
not even Marc Jacobs remarkable does
