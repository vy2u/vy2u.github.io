channel so today I'm going to be doing a
review on the water break though because
it's so hot right now
I'm gonna be doing a review on the huda
beauty of birth filter foundation and
also the primer I didn't buy the brush
because it's just a brush
and to me don't really care for it I
have seen this hyped up all over my
socials for quite some time now I know
when he first started talking about
coming out with a foundation I was super
keen to try it now I got this shade
angel-food 110 10 so 110 neutral socks
kind of like a pinky undertone to it I
think I hope haven't swatched it I'm
about to and then we also have the
primer which is a complexion perfection
pre makeup base so let's give these well
and see how they go in gone wet my
beauty blend up because I actually
forgot for once in a while haven't done
that for a while okay so first I'm just
gonna take the primer packaging on fleek
I love Hooters packaging boys so nice
this is what the bottle of the primer
looks like and it is a thick white
consistency okay so a little bit hectic
what's it smell like it's quite a thick
consistency it's not very thin and it's
quite sticky true doesn't mean it's a
bad thing right so I'm just gonna apply
this all over my face as per use that's
looking pretty good now let's get the
foundation out now packaging for this
foundation I'm living it's so chic and
so sleek this is what the packaging
looks like I love it seriously if I was
to come out with the foundation that
this is what the packaging would be
similar to because I am obsessed
yeah I'm gonna squirts where they sell
them to the back of my hand it's always
really hard buying foundations online
because you just don't know you know
what I mean like you're better off
getting it in person but it actually
just came out in Sephora in Australia so
so I should have waited because I think
it cost me for these true products to
get to Australia with the conversion
rate
and shipping from Dubai o is like 158
dollars which is crossbar okay what I'm
gonna do let's just drop this I
should have got a different color but as
I said it's so hard to tell I'm just
gonna dot this all over my skin I
really should have got a different color
okay all right hard to tell online this
is literally white whoops
oh well that's my fault all right I'm
just gonna take my Beauty Blender and
I'm just gonna go in and start blending
this all in this is blending out
sorry Wow definitely full coverage but
 I'm pissed off about the color ah
that's my fault though it's my fault my
fault
Casper the Garth today that's fine just
gonna take a bit more in the back of my
hand and I'm gonna see if I can build it
up not gonna need to because it's super
full coverage but I'm going to
I'm just going to apply old down my neck
sort of like my head is Fullerton
because we really need to get this
matched up to my neck but so far the
foundation is super full coverage and
I'm really liking it just wish I had a
more me color
okay so I have applied all of my
foundation now what I'm gonna do is I'm
just gonna go ahead and do the rest of
my makeup and then I'm gonna come back
to you guys and we'll give you my final
thoughts on this still pissed off about
the color but let's move on
BRB okay guys I am back and now the rest
of my makeup is all done now for my
final thoughts so my final thoughts on
this foundation is I am in love with it
it is super super buildable it looks
really different from what I just had my
foundation on before because I went over
my face with a bit of a darker powder
just to make it more my skin tone but
the foundation overall in itself is
super full coverage um products pack
onto it really really well and I had no
problems with blending it out
blotchiness or anything like that what I
will do is I will get a new color of it
just because it'll be easier and I won't
have to play with powders and try and
make it work it'll just work straight
off the bat no I know this just has been
released in Australia in Sephora I think
today or tomorrow this is not sponsored
by the way but I'm just saying you need
to get your hands on this if you love a
good full coverage foundation there are
so many out there these days but this
one I'm in love and also my thoughts on
the primer to be honest I'm not really
sure because I can never tell with
primers like I just don't know if they
work is it just like a marketing act I
don't I don't know to be honest I'm the
only primer that I really live for is
the Porefessional by benefit cuz it
literally does blow your skin like you
can literally have it on your forehead
and in your pores and you can actually
physically see it blur your pores and
fill them in so it gives you a nice base
for your foundation but this does smell
really good and I'll probably use it
again I know this video wasn't very
informative because I'm not very good at
explaining things but you guys asked for
a review on this hence why I bought it
and I wanted to try it out myself
I love it give it a whirl and see what
you think for yourself also one other
thing I might just add in is it has
dried super super matte so I don't know
if it would be good for dry skin but it
could be I don't really have dry skin
sometimes I do sometimes I don't anyway
I hope you guys really enjoyed this
video if you did make sure you give it a
massive thumbs up I love you guys so
much and I will see you in my next video
 see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
