today I thought I would do trying a new
beauty hacks and viral beauty makeup
trends I guess they're not really beauty
there's one Beauty one that I want to do
but majority Zimmer makeup today and the
makeup Channel I want to keep it going
with the whole makeup situation that I'm
saying so basically I have a ton
not a ton i've got like six
different hacks that i want to try and
they're a bit weird I mean
they're like a the next-level you
know what I'm saying like it's nothing
normal I wouldn't call this normal I'd
call this bike I guess I don't know
don't forget if you are new to my
channel and you have not subscribed or
any going to get ten thousand scribe
button to keep up with all my future
videos and let's get straight into this
video okay so this is so dumb but the
first hack that I want to try is using
Louvre as a primer are you
serious whose idea was this anyway I'm
gonna wrap remove the cat fur thanking
alright tell you sun's gonna take a
little bit of this like deal thank you
oh my god I don't think I can do this I
hate the smell of Lube it's disgusting I
honestly don't think I can do this
okay it's not that bad okay Pranav ugh
it's my skin breakdown i'ma cut someone
kiss fiercely who's a dentist so
I should feel really nice going on your
skin to be on earth like stunning okay
will it work as a primer throughout the
day though I have no idea so
because I'm not letting this on my face
as soon as I finish this video this
is coming off thank you so so my
foundation today we are going to be
using a hack that's been quite popular
on Instagram lately and a lot of people
have been doing it I don't know if it
works
but we're going to give it a shot it is
applying a applying your foundation with
a condom so basically you get the condom
you put the condom over the
Beautyblender and then you DAP and then
you dab thank you this isn't a real
Beauty Blender this is from Real
Techniques I'm just going to be using
this today because it's what's in front
of me and you guys know me I can't be
stuck getting out once I've sat down for
a video hence why majority at a time my
beauty blenders are drowned in 60-plus
or from a water bottle that's been
sitting in my room because honestly on
that lazy there we go
to take this out they'll roll it down my
fingers and then I'm going to shove the
blender in there oh my god
is this actually a thing I can't get the
 tip that's what show you bad
here we go okay so once our little
Connie that's our nickname for our
condom today we are just going to a
moment to watch the Lu bosses oh well no
one gave instructions in their Instagram
tutorials to watch the Lube off so I'm a
not doing this literally looks so
disgusting just like on my
makeup table so I'm just going to take a
little bit of foundation on the back of
my hand today and then I'm just going to
pick up this little ideas
oh if you put air into and hold it like
that would that work better and I'm
getting to the foundation so
this is cook and I'm just gonna start oh
 we've seen so much um I mean a
Beauty Blender would be a lot
easier the you're joking oh wow
that looks flawless it's not patchy at
all it's not you know just sitting on
top of my pores it's actually going in
there I'm joking are you serious
what's the fuck's with the
condom it's a real work well
it's literally just sitting on top of
everything and texturising everything
and it does not look stunning at all so
it's hacked is definitely not
 work someone actually asked
you to do a full face of tampons and
pads I mean that funny and I don't think
I've seen anyone draw it but I actually
website something on Instagram this
morning and someone's doing it I don't
think I really want to do that because
that's a bit a bit too hot I'm
saying well my foundation looks
absolutely stunning so full face using a
condom has anybody done that like a
condom with a Beauty Blender on it oh my
god if I should do that video leave a
comment down below it'll be funny I mean
it'll be funny but it will be
dumb but it's entertainment that's what
I'm here for
okay so the next tax that I want to try
is using dental floss to do your
eyeliner weird
so you're meant to get a liquid liner
and just I'll just show you what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to
take a decent amount of dental floss
 oh okay so how I'm is off
are you serious so I guess I'm just
gonna like give me that in my hand so
I'm holding it you know what it is
I'm gonna get the other dental floss
 so for some reason I still like
this little device here with the floss
on is gonna be a lot more easier to do
you know what I'm saying so I've got my
little thing here and I'm just gonna
paint
I guess the front of it where it's gonna
go on my eye okay let's do this oh ah
they all do I do that right I've seen
people like rested on the base of their
high and then kind of like much easier
using a brush darling it might be a good
way for beginners to do eyeliner like
just to get that and like probably
practice with this that might be good
but see the brush hon okay well that
whole dental floss trick can off
because doesn't work for me doll okay
moving on to our next hack this is just
okay whatever it could work you know
what I shouldn't judge it before I
actually do it because it might actually
work
so this is using a bottle cap to do a
cut crease so basically all you need to
do is I'm just going to put a little bit
of foundation on my eye so there's a bit
of a base there just take your condom
and shove it on your eye people
probably thinking why not using card
Showtek to prime your eyes I'm not using
that good in this videos oh come on
so I'm just going to be taking up my
bottle cap and I'm going to use a blue
eye shadow just so you guys can see
really well like if this does work so
you're basically just meant to take the
bottle cap and go over the edge of the
bottle cap and it's meant to give you a
precise line without moving it and
blending that eye shadow up okay the big
reveal you guys ready
I mean it's actually pretty creative and
it would work but for someone with eyes
like me what the is that okay so
the last hack that I want to try it's
got nothing to do with my face it is
actually if you get lipstick I don't
know if it's liquid or regular lipstick
for today I'm going to be using some a
regular lipstick apparently you could
get on something why I mean I mean I
don't really have any lipstick on here
so Oh what oh she died I've got lipstick
all over my shirt serious so apparently
if you spray it with hairspray let it
dry off and then if you take a wet cloth
it gets everything out so i'ma show you
guys this yes
oh my god I think it's coming out I mean
it doesn't get it out but it definitely
helps get rid of some of the lipstick
but all of it I mean it's still their
home did I do that wrong I don't know
okay guys so that's all the hacks that
I've got to share with you guys today I
know it wasn't a very serious video it's
more just fit entertainment and because
I did actually want to try the exact out
so if you guys do enjoy this video or if
you want to see a part two or if you
have any requests that you want me to
try that a weird makeup hacks or any
video requests in general leave them
down below and I'll be happy to add them
to my list of to do videos I hope you
guys have an amazing night day wherever
in the world you are I love you guys so
much and I'll see you all in my next
video bye
 see ya hello now this wet cloth
that I've got from the bathroom I'll
just take this off because there is
Lube on my head</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
