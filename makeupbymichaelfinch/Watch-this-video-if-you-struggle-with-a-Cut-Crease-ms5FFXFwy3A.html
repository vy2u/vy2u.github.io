channel so today I thought I'd do a
quick little video on a tip that has
helped me absolutely like I would like
to say master a cut crease this has
helped me so much with my confidence and
whatnot on doing cut creases and
especially if you do makeup on clients
this will help you as well now at my
master classes I told everybody about
this and everyone was like ah that's so
like genius like I feel like not a lot
of people know about it I've been doing
it in a few videos lately but I just
want to make a separate video on it
because I really want you guys to know
that races can be really really
easy with that any further ado let's get
straight into this video and if you guys
want to see more little videos like this
about things that help me out and little
tips and tricks that makes you give this
video a thumbs up and let's get into it
now that we opted nice and close and
personal don't let's get into it sir
basically I'm just gonna show you guys
the trick what I like to do so the first
step is just take any concealer that you
like to use I like to use a thicker
concealer when I do a cut crease option
slide all over the place does that make
sense so I've already put a little bit
of the taut shape tape on the back of my
hand this is in the shade light/medium
honey and I'm kind of just letting it
get a little bit thicker and then I'm
just gonna be taking it just a synthetic
shader brush you can use any size you
want but I prefer to use like something
this size it depends what I can find
like honestly if there's a brush this
size all it's like half this size
whatever I can find first I'll just pick
it up because if I can't find something
in time I just won't use it and I'll
just use whatever I can find because I'm
lazy sorry I'm just gonna take some of
that concealer on both sides of the
brush and just load it up
then what I like to do is I'll just go
all across my lid now this really works
well if you have hooded eyes as well go
all across my lid right to the inner
corner I'll take a little bit more so
it's nice and wet on there and then I'll
just go literally this is all you do
just go look around that way that way
let that now as you can see I did get
some concealer on my lashes so it has
gone up and made some striking lines but
ignore that so now that we've got the
line of where the crease is gonna be and
it's not gonna transfer okay so I'm just
gonna be using this this line here as a
guideline there's true where my cut
crease is actually gonna go so then when
I open my eye it's not gonna transfer at
all that was my biggest problem when I
you know did cut creases and whatnot
transferring because I couldn't work out
where the line went but literally all
you need to do is put on your lash line
and look up and then like Bob's your
 hole and then I'll just fill this
part in here
and then I'll just fill in this little
part over here now that we've got that
base sort of going on you guys kind of
get my gist now right then all I'm gonna
do is just go straight over the top of
that with an eye shadow and I'm just
gonna pop that all in there just like
that now when I get to the outer edge
the outer edge of a cup crease I never
like to put a matte shade directly over
concealer because that's where it tends
to get a little bit stuck and has that
really horrible line I'm just gonna pop
this over the concealer and just kind of
Pat it on and press it in just over the
edge of that
see how that's just kind of blended into
nothing and there's no like harsh line
or anything like that and just touching
up around the edge that so that is
pretty much the cut crease it is not
going to move now I'm just gonna show
you guys how to get rid of those little
bits it can still that we've got stuck
up there no I'm just gonna take a clean
blending brush and I'm just gonna gently
just like rub over the concealer that's
gone up there that's pretty much gone
and I'm just going take a little bit of
that transition color that I used and
just run over the edges like that okay
so that's pretty much all gone or that
concealer that up on my lashes to
make sure you don't get on your lashes
rule number one we all learn from our
mistakes Jeff now for some reason if
you're not happy with your cut crease
and you want more definition around the
crease area I just like to take a really
defined angle brush just like this one
I'll dip it into a bit of like black
eyeshadow and tap off all the excess
 you don't want extra product on
here because this is where I can get
just messy and then what I like to do is
just run along the edge very lightly and
kind of define it
that's to find the race a little
bit more and then if you just want to go
in with like a little brush or something
like this
and just kind of blend out that black
very slightly
there we go now my most common ask
question with a race is how do you
not get it all you know muggy and dirty
on the out of a what I like to Jews as I
said I put the shimmery color over the
concealer first never put a matte shade
or everywhere can still add that's when
it gets messy what I'll do is I'm just
gonna take a little bit of the burgundy
color that I used previously on my eye
and I'm just gonna gently Pat that on
the outer V and I'm just gonna kind of
bring it in
really slightly okay so I'll kind of
just blended that onto the lid as you
can see then what I'm gonna do is just
go in with a black shutter and the same
brush and I'm just gonna pop it right
onto the outer V very sparingly just in
padding Martians bring it up a little
bit
okay guys and this is pretty much how I
do my creases the easy way I know
this video was very short and sweet but
I hope it did help some of you guys out
if it did make sure you give it a thumbs
up I love you guys so much and I'll see
you all in my next video see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
