today we're trying out a full face of
$1.00 makeup done a couple other $1.00
makeup videos I've tried Dollar Tree
makeup dye so which is like the Japanese
one dollar store I actually did a full
face of shop miss a I want to say I was
a couple years ago so I wanted to do
kind of an updated ones they're pop in
out the new products for $1 they've
totally expanded on their a Oh a studio
line which is like the shop miss a brand
itself they also carry other brands on
there but most of stuff that I got for
this video was from that line because
I've heard really good things and I
basically just picked up everything
we're trying out sponges eyeshadows face
products concealer everything so if
you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the baby toe
family and subscribe I upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific
time next week I'm gonna be having a
shadow and schmooze coming which is
where we just chill and talk and put
makeup on do a little life update talk
about the series and yeah just have a
little catch-up session so that will be
coming next week right I've got
everything lined up here we have so much
stuff to try out this is gonna be a full
face if I ordered everything I needed to
I'm like 99% sure this is gonna be a
full day so I'm super excited I've
watched him oyster as my skin we're
gonna start out with the AOA Studio
Wonder skin illuminating primer carry
other $1 brands on there but from my
experience things in the past the AOA
studio stuff definitely the most
promising so I wanted to try out a ton
more stuff from that tried a few things
here and there this is a very ooh very
glowy primer has a nice stick to it it
does feel pretty thick going on feels
kind of like a thick lotion kind of
primer I think from what I can see in
the viewfinder right now I think the
lighting looks good right now hopefully
try new things try new things that was
giving me a major glow I'd like if I'm
not wearing makeup one day but I want a
glow to my face I probably wouldn't put
this all over but I would put it on like
the high points on my forehead
cheekbones nose and it would give like a
super natural kind of glow that's pretty
I like that the face product we're gonna
be trying as the AOA perfect BB cream in
the shade fair this is the lightest
shade gives the face a luminous glow to
eliminate dull skin for a brow
Piron enhance your natural skin tone
while reducing fine lines and pores sign
me up the shade looks like I think it's
gonna be pretty good it looks pretty
thick so I got two sponges from them
that came in these little bags I've
already dampened them so we can get into
it but this one feels so nice and soft
and squishy it got much bigger feels
like it's gonna be nice feels really
bouncy and then I also picked up this
one which is more of like a real
technique it's kind of shape has the
angled side which I like this
this one definitely feels a bit more
dense in this one I also got a couple
face brushes I got the flat top kabuki
f1 this one feels soft but it's a bit
flimsier than I usually like in a kabuki
brush but this one the thing is worn off
so I'm not sure what number this is but
I'm gonna have everything link down
below in the description box but this
one feels nice it feels like a good
amount of stiff I think I'm gonna go
with this on half my face and then
probably the pink sponge on the other
side cuz I'm really curious about this
one
so yesterday I picked up my first little
foster dog if you follow me on snapchat
you've already seen way too many snaps
of him but his name's Snoopy he is the
sweetest little guy he's pretty old and
he's mostly blind in a little bit deaf
too I can hear his little feet right
outside the door I feel bad that I'm
like in here for a couple hours but he
will just kind of like walk into things
so if there's a lot of stuff in the room
like in this room it's hard for him to
like kind of dodge everything so it's
way easier out in the rest of my
apartment for him like coverage but it's
sitting on my skin really nice it just
looks like a tinted moisturizer I can
still see everything coming through but
toned down some of my redness and in a
product like this that's usually what I
look for true test is always my forehead
this brush feels for a dollar feels good
still feels a little bit too flimsy for
what I like but I mean it totally works
for a dollar brush I have a bunch of
videos testing out kind of affordable
brush sets from Amazon from romwe I
don't love how it's sitting on my
forehead I think I'm definitely gonna
have to smooth this out with a sponge up
there I'm gonna go in with the tiny bit
more so let's try this sponge and was
gonna first oh whoa this feels so nice
like bouncy and soft grace how much this
soaks up because it
feels very and almost like too fluffy
but we'll see it's super soft but
anyways Snoopy is up for adoption so if
you're in the Washington area and you
want a sweet little guy who's pretty
chill in contact Seattle humane I think
their emails foster at Seattle humane
org I'm contacting me about him because
there's nothing I can do you have to go
through the shelter I'm kind of building
this up up here whew okay that looks way
better with the sponge that looks pretty
nice for a one dollar kind of tinted
moisturizer BB cream situation I mean I
have 60 dollar foundations that look way
 here this is something that I would
wear to like go to the chiropractor just
run errands like something where I just
want my skin toned to look a little bit
more even but I don't want to put on
like a full on foundation I just want it
to still look kind of natural it's
looking really pretty in the shade I
think it's pretty good I have concealers
so I might do a little bit of spot
concealing just on some of my scarring
this is super exciting they have a $1
white concealers you can use this to
lighten up any concealer if it's too
dark or if you have very very very fair
skin and you need to use this shade as a
concealer you obviously could do that
and then I have the same wonder cover
concealer in the lightest shade
porcelain so I'm gonna try out this
shade and then if I need to lighten it
we'll go in with that white brightening
shade what this feels like it's gonna
dry really quickly blend it out right
away
I think the shade is good I don't think
now I'm definitely not gonna have to
lighten this that's exciting
oh this dries hella fast like you got to
work quickly with this thing that looks
like it has a pretty good coverage to me
there's a tiny bit peeking through right
here of some darkness but overall I
would say that's probably full coverage
that was good and I liked the show you'd
think the shade is pretty good for me
even as you're putting it on right away
it feels like it's about 70% dried I
don't like using a damp sponge for my
under eyes I find it takes away a lot of
the coverage on my skin but if you have
issues blending this out because it
dries so quickly you could definitely
try that this is looking nice I'm like
not mad about this base at all right now
I might go in with that brightening
shade just right on the inner corner I
think I'm gonna do that it looks like it
has a kind of a lie
purple white tint to it which that's how
I used a mixed lavender concealer is to
brighten the shade it's called
highlighter but it doesn't look like it
has shimmer or anything in it a little
bit o formula feels a lot different
maybe it's just not layering the best on
top of that yeah you can blend it out to
work I think the way to go would be to
just mix the shades right off when I
both still wet and I'm blended out but
that brightened my under eyes as of
right now I would use that concealer
again it's gonna be nice coverage okay
since I think that concealer shade is
gonna be too light for spot concealing
I'm actually just gonna use my normal
brush this is one of the Sigma's is the
F 83 by Sigma and I'm just gonna try and
build it up down here this is the BB
cream again cuz I feel like that brush
wasn't giving me the best coverage okay
there we go this is looking good I have
an extension papa now I need to get him
retyped
I've been thinking about doing a video
all about the tape ins now that I've had
them for how long have even had these I
feel like almost a year I feel like I
have a good grasp on my thoughts on them
now and everything after having him for
so long so let me know if you guys would
want to see a video all about tape ins I
also had fusion extensions for awhile so
maybe I could do like a tape ins versus
fusions alright so I got two of their
studio loose powders the first one is
the perfect setting at least I both feel
perfect setting powder one is in the
shade brightening and one is in the
shade soft light so I'm gonna take these
out so you can see it'll look like the
brightening shade looks very peachy oh
this one looks pretty light and it looks
like a nice shade this is soft light
like recently we've talked about loose
powders in my skin like fifty thousand
times just come up a lot so I'm not
gonna go into it but those powders
typically don't work just throwing it
out there so new people know so I
usually don't use loose powders on my
face or under eyes but these are the
only powders I have and I do want to try
them so I'm hoping this doesn't like
totally ruin the good base I have going
on right now so I think I'm just gonna
take a dry sponge I don't like dampening
my sponges to use with loose powder on
one eye and then I might try a brush
underneath the other eye but I don't
like baking if under a loose powder
works on me is just pressing it in so
the shade is nice
light and brightening for sure yeah
shade is nice doesn't look horrible but
it's definitely making my undereyes kind
of creepy right here looks a lot better
though than most loose powders when I
try to use him underneath my eyes like
way better that doesn't look half bad I
do want to try my brush on this side so
I'm going to go in with my BH Cosmetics
brush this is 137 evenly coat the brush
chop off a bit oh that looks pretty good
I'm shocked because loose powders
usually are a complete disaster
underneath my eyes this is not looking
bad at all that looks pretty damn good
I like this shade I feel like this shade
is good for my skintone and it's still a
little bit brightening but it's not
stark white or too light so far I'm very
pleasantly surprised right now so this
brush side definitely looks better I
have a lot less creasing on the brush
side that looks like a full coverage
under eye right there this one I look
way more desert II and crepey so I'm
actually just gonna add a tiny bit more
powder and going in with my brush on
this side and try and just kind of get a
little bit more coverage and smooth that
out yes I I would do that again like I
would use that concealer and I would use
that powder with this brush I am kind of
shocked I'm kind of shocked I probably
could blend stuff on top of it but I
want to make sure I have a good soft
base for the blush and bronzer and
everything to go on top of since we're
trying it out so I think I'm gonna go in
with this peach shade now this is very
peachy it almost looks like the Patrick
Starr Mac powder to try that peachy
shade just to set my cheek area right
here I'm not gonna set the rest of my
face because this is where I'm gonna be
blending stuff on top oh oh yeah that's
what usually happens to my powders it
just takes away so much of the coverage
it just like instantly the redness and
stuff comes through yes I'm gonna do the
same thing on the other side but I kind
of wish I didn't do that it feels really
soft though my skin like feels very soft
doesn't feel like I have a lot of makeup
on at all just on my skin I wouldn't use
this one as in all of her face powder
I'm not gonna set my forehead at all
because I really like the glowy forehead
let's move on to brows so I've got three
different brow products here to try the
first one is like a brow pomade like
Anastasio dip brow type of thing it's
called the wonder brow tinted brow
pomade
the next is the sculpting brow pencil
and I also have the go brow fiber gel
which I'm super curious about my drew
combo of all three of these get a little
spooley on one end oh this is like that
I think is the covergirl one I tried to
send a first impressions has like the
teardrop shape right there which I'm not
really a fan of but I might try and use
like the tip to fill in so let's start
out with this the shade is a little bit
warm yeah it's also not quite dark
enough but I might use this just for the
front going on really smooth and easily
though like the actual formula feels
really nice it doesn't have too much
pigment to it but you can just glide it
over I'm gonna use the pomade on like
the second half of my brow so the
puppies in the shade dark brown I'm
gonna use an angled brush feels creamy
going in oh I like that shade a lot
better ones a little bit darker and
definitely a little bit more cool toned
mmm I don't love this one I do think
what is it called tinted I would say
it's like a tinted brow pomade doesn't
seem like it's as pigmented as a lot of
other brow pomade it's just kind of
tinting so if you like kind of a more
natural or maybe you have a lot of
Harry's naturally and you want those
hairs to show through but you just want
to fill it in that would probably work
I'm definitely gonna have to carve out
my brows concealer today cuz that just
got a little wild don't love it don't
hate it
well I just made a tea in there let's go
in with the go brow fiber gel has a
little short kind of stubby wand right
here I'm gonna brush this over and hope
the colors good oh okay it's definitely
helping to like emphasize those actual
hairs that I have it did kind of like
bring them out and make my brow look
more three-dimensional it feels a bit
dry or something but I like how it's
bringing my hairs out and I think the
shade looks nice too that did make my
brows feel kind of like heavy crispy I'm
gonna go in with that concealer and just
shape them a little bit this eye is
getting very minimal creasing for me
like I have a tiny line right here but
that's very normal and I usually get
more like on this I think also because
that concealer dries down so much I feel
like this concealer would actually
probably be a grey eyeshadow base maybe
even the white one oh I kind of want to
use this Wow
dries so fast and I blend this out with
my finger I think this formula feels a
little bit off the white one I don't
know if it just looks like a bit patchy
or something can't blend it after like
two seconds I'm gonna put some of the
other concealer on top just to kind of
fade it out and blend it there we go
yeah this concealer feels a lot
different than the white one ready for
some shadow I'm gonna do that first or
else do shadow I don't really feel like
doing blush and bronzer yet so I was
excited for all this stuff but I think I
was most excited for their new I think
they're fairly new they're like single
pan eyeshadows so I got eight these are
the shades and then they have this AOA
magnetic palette and I have two bronzer
pans in here too and I kept one in the
packaging to show you guys I love the
basic just white and black packaging
this is a buck just take the pan out of
here and you can pop in any kind of
magnetic palette you have like a Z
palette whatever I also make this little
square palette which I also got to put
some of the highlighters and blushes and
that I got I'm really feeling this row
right now so I think I'm gonna do just
kind of like a simple cool toned look I
don't have a black eye camera if the
black was out of stock or something I
feel like it would've got the black
eyeshadow if they had one in stock but
we're gonna start out with this shade
right here 5511 Oh feels hello soft okay
I don't like setting my concealer with
the powder because I feel like then your
eyeshadows are going on top of another
powder and they just don't stick and
hold up as well throughout the day so I
personally like putting it on top of
like a stickier base and I don't really
ever have issues blending on top of a
sticky base that's pretty that's
blending out easily
I like that shade oh yeah well we
totally forgot about my coffee I'm so
excited now I'm gonna take another matte
shade this one's a little bit deeper
this is a m75 5 to 3
everything will be linked down below and
I always link it in order to so lets
blend this into the crease it has like a
little bit of purple like mauve to it
I'm gonna go back with my bigger fluffy
brush I also always link my brushes I
use down below I'm feeling both of those
shades there's like very few things
right now that I'm
like and this is exciting I don't know
if I want to take this shade which looks
really pretty this is five five 200 or
this one which is more of like a pinky
shimmer this is 500 - I might put this
all over the lids a darker one and then
pop the other one on the center whoo
that feels soft press this on this one
is more of like Sheen not super shimmery
but the more I build it up the more pop
we're getting okay there we go there we
go this one actually might be a brush
shadow it kind of feels like that I'm
gonna try it with brush and see if it's
any different and then I might try
spraying it with setting spray - this is
one of the shadows that I actually think
one of the rare shadows that works
better with the brush I want to see what
this rosy air shade looks like oh that
looks pretty okay I'm gonna put that
right on the center maybe even I might
just layer this all over this is really
pretty
this one looks totally different than
that first shimmer shade this one I
think is gonna be really pretty wet I
also have this Santee professional eye
shadow I kind of want to see what this
lightest one looks like that could
potentially be an inner corner shade so
this is I think one of the only things
that isn't the AOA Studio line that I
got so this one feels soft it looks a
little bit flaky but I might try this on
the inner corner I am gonna wet this one
and use a brush hmm don't love that one
something a little bit more bright I'm
gonna try the baked highlighter I have
here this isn't the shade cream puff it
looks like kind of a champagne it feels
pretty Scratchy okay wait I actually
have a lighter shade this one is in the
shade cloud same one this is just like
more of a pearly white I think I'm gonna
use this one on the inner corner yeah
alright so again I'm gonna wet it this
is like the ten step in our corner right
here there we go
I'm gonna take the first shade we
started with and pop that down here have
a black gel it says gel liner I think
yeah super intense gel black liner that
I'm gonna try for the waterline I like
that it comes with a sharpener attached
because I never know where my frickin
sharpener is isn't like the most black
on the waterline yeah I definitely
prefer my la girl one and the LA girl
one is just a couple bucks so for like a
dollar two more I would get the LA girl
one over this one I'm gonna blend this a
little bit underneath
- and I'm gonna smudge it out with the
flat liner brush and I'm bringing this
low because my wing is gonna start like
right here so I just connect it to where
the wings gonna be let's get some top
eyeliner going I don't think I have a
liquid liner do I I'm gonna apply my
liquid liner this is the only thing
that's not gonna be one dollar the wings
are intense today I'm hoping I have
lashes that are gonna fill these out
this looks interesting it's a pre lash
in hyper lash so kind of like an eyelash
primer and then mascara I'm guessing I'm
hoping this isn't gonna be like super
fibery because it was usually kind of
irritate my eyes so let's see how this
pre lash is oh it's black mascara primer
it's black that's kind of nice don't you
have to worry about having the white
lashes and I am still putting false
lashes on I just want to see how these
are first so this feels very like thin
lightweight doesn't really feel like
mascara it seems to be separating my
lashes nicely
smells like chemical blueberries okay
let's go in with the mascara Oh No okay
this is totally like the fibers that
just went all over the place yeah
major fibers right here I'm gonna skip
the fibers because I am putting false
lashes on and I don't want my eyes to
get totally red and irritated so I have
two pairs of false lashes here these
look exactly like the demi whispies
these are the scarlet lashes by AOA and
then I also have the Aria oh wait hell
yeah okay actually one more these are
Elle these ones are definitely more
dramatic I'm gonna try these ones okay
so my lashes are on and I put on some
bottom lash mascara and I actually
really like these lashes I feel like
they add a good amount of volume but
there's still a little bit more natural
and a little bit like wispy at the top
so they don't look super super dramatic
and the band is really thin and
lightweight so they feel pretty
comfortable on right now let's do some
blush bronzer and highlight so like I
said I have these two bronzer shades
right here I'm obviously gonna go in
with this one because it's much closer
to my bronzer tone this isn't the shade
absolute and I believe this was the
lightest one I definitely would have got
the lightest one so we're gonna try this
it looks pretty warm but we'll see so my
face is powdered what this looks pretty
orange okay I'm gonna blend it over to
the side because I think it got a little
bit too much definitely
warm bronzer so if you're not into that
you wouldn't like the shade and I'm just
applying this with a really light hand
because I think it would look too
overboard
like it's getting a tiny bit patchy in
certain areas I just have three
highlights in here this pink shade is
actually a highlight technically and
then this blush shade so I'm really
excited to try this shade this blush
shade is called chromo and I'm really
into these pinky shades and it looks
like it has a little bit of glow that is
soft woo that has a pretty glow to it oh
I like that now on to highlight I have
no idea what I'm gonna do here because
these two definitely look too dark but
this one might look different on I did
get the white one but I did like a light
swatch and it looked really bluey purple
I don't know if any of these pan ones
are gonna work out dink we're gonna go
on with the baked eye lighter and the
shade cream puffs this brush I just want
to try because this feels really nice
and fluffy this is the f19 brush oh
that's way more intense than I thought
it was gonna be on the face that looks
pretty and this brush feels really soft
going on I'm gonna try it with my usual
highlight brush that I used my Sigma fo3
the Sigma one is a bit longer and a bit
more tapered like it's not as fat this
side
that's pretty it did not feel promising
just feeling it in here cuz it feels
really Scratchy
but on it does not look bad again it's
not the most softening over texture so
if you're like me and you have a lot of
texture here it's gonna show it a bit
actually have a setting spray I have the
pro setting spray but it says it has a
matte finish which I don't know about
maybe it would be a good balance
actually right now cuz my face is pretty
dewy looking here's the packaging I like
it all black doesn't smell like anything
actually this is kind of reminded me of
the Physicians Formula one does this
have a ton of alcohol in it
oh it actually doesn't I don't see
alcohol on here glycerin aloe castor oil
and have to look that up I don't know
how good castor oil is on your face but
I'm gonna try and just avoid my lashes I
usually spray setting spray before but
um lashes let's see what it looks like
down here did that just remove what the
heck I've never had that
in what settings but I don't think it
looks like it just like wiped off some
of the BB cream well I guess I'm gonna
try and blend a little bit more BB cream
right there since that just took it off
I did powder so I don't want to like go
too crazy with this right now so it gets
all weird textured I probably won't be
using that settings break I'm really
glad I didn't just spray that all over
my face so I got a few lip options here
just a few this is the Wonder matte
liquid lipstick this was in this shade
faded this one's in the shade extra I
think I might layer this shade with that
first nude oh wow that's a lot more
purple than I was picturing feels very
thin that's a pretty purple though I
like that it's not too intense it's a
little bit muted but still nice like
spring color it feels pretty thin and
drying it almost feels like the
colour-pop matte formula yeah it feels
very drying but this shade I think is
really pretty I don't even think I want
to layer anything on this so this is the
final look
I am overall so pleasantly surprised
right now I feel like I liked the
majority of the things I put on my face
