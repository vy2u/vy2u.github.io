right so today we have my top
foundations if you're a pale princess if
you're new to my channel I'll put a
playlist down below where you can check
out some of my other videos for pale
skin you can kind of see what foundation
combinations I use and just products
that I love and things that I've found
over the years that work really great
for pale skin if you self tan or if
you're just new to embracing your pale
skin and you're trying to find
foundations that work I have collected a
good amount over the years I'm excited
to share them with you guys it feels
great when you can actually find a
foundation that matches your skin tone
and that doesn't make you look like a
new biloba anymore
I definitely went through the
self-tanner phase if you want to hear
all about my pale skin journey and how I
learned to embrace my skin you can watch
my how to love your pale skin video that
will be linked down below and on the
little eye over here if you're on mobile
alright let's just get into it so like I
said it can be freaking hard to find
foundation that matches your skin tone
if you are as pale as I am it doesn't
look good wearing foundation that's too
dark for you and it feels so much better
when you have something that actually it
matches your body and that you are
confident in and that you enjoy wearing
so I have ten products here and I'm just
going to start with drugstore the more
horrible stuff and then we're going to
work our way up to high-end I do want to
mention one product at the beginning of
this video and that's the Manic Panic
dreamtone if you've been subscribed to
me for a while you're probably sick of
me talking about this this is my Holy
Grail product for pale skin it's
basically a white foundation that you
can mix in with anything it's like 12 or
13 bucks on Amazon link will be down
below I have a whole review on this I
have tons of get ready with me videos
using this you can basically mix this
into any foundation to make it light
enough for you if you don't mind mixing
foundations you can actually make a ton
of foundations that were too dark for
you work by using this bad boy I'm not
going to mention ones that I mix with
this because the whole point of this
videos actual foundations that are light
enough on their own that's just a little
side tip so the first foundation I'm
going to mention is the hard candy
glamoflauge foundation this is in the
shade porcelain it's actually came out
this year and it's been a frickin
lifesaver for me shade porcelain by
itself is super super pale it's a tiny
bit too light
my skin tone that is like a sentence has
never come out of my mouth in my entire
life so if you have even paler skin than
I do is paler award more pale if you
have fair skin than I do this will be
perfect for you I don't think I've ever
met anyone that has paler skin than I do
but if you're out there this is for you
and this is super cheap you can get this
at Walmart just a tip brands are known
for discontinuing their super pale
shades so if you try this out and you
like it I would order a few backups I
actually have like four backups of this
just in case next product is the Loreal
Pro matte infallible 24-hour foundation
this is by L'Oreal they say that it is
more on the pricey side for the
drugstore but it's totally worth it I'll
name all the shades but you can pretty
much assume that I'm the lightest shade
and every single foundation that I
mentioned this is in the shade 101
classic ivory this is light enough on
its own it's super long-lasting has a
nice matte finish I'm not usually a fan
of matte so I usually mix this with like
illuminizer or just another foundation
that has a little bit more like
luminosity to it but if you like matte
foundations this will be perfect for you
next drugstore product is the Rimmel
stay matte and 0/10 light porcelain have
a whole review on this foundation it's
basically a liquid mousse foundation
this one is super lightweight is
buildable and it has nice coverage also
I should mention that most of the
foundations that I'm talking about are
pretty full coverage medium to full or
buildable to full coverage that's why I
usually go for especially because I used
a pretty intense cystic acne and I still
have acne scars and stuff that I have to
cover up this I think is like 6 bucks
from the drugstore around there if you
have oily skin this keeps you looking
shine free next is the Maybelline fit me
shine free foundation stick this is a
stick foundation which I'm not usually a
fan of this isn't super long-lasting but
if you're just looking for like a quick
run into the grocery store kind of thing
I just put a few swipes of this on my
face and blend it out with a foundation
brush and you'll be good to go I also
mention that my favorite foundation
brush is the Sigma round kabuki f82
in my opinion is totally worth it to
invest in a good foundation brush like
this guy this gives the best coverage
for me and I just love it
I've had the same exact brush since
sophomore year of college so about
almost 4 years now
it's still going strong it's great you
need this I also like to apply my
foundation with a foundation sponge this
is the Real Techniques miracle
complexion sponge actually like this
better than the Beauty Blender and it's
about a third of the price this is like
six dollars or something from Ulta all
right my last drugstore pick is the
Revlon Colorstay 1/10 ivory this is
probably the most popular drugstore
foundations has been around for years
it's just one of those foundations that
you can always go back to and it always
looks good it's light enough for my skin
super long-lasting you can mix it in
with other stuff or just wear it by
itself I just have a pump on it from
Beadie MP if you're a beginner with
foundation but want something that has
good coverage I would probably suggest
one of these to you just give great
coverage and re fairly easy to apply so
now we're going to go into high-end I
have for high-end foundations that I'm
going to mention today the first is Mac
Studio Fix fluid this is in the shade
and w10 I don't believe you can buy this
in stores I think you have to order the
shade online unless they've changed that
this is just their classic Studio Fix
fluid foundation it reminds me a lot of
the Revlon Colorstay foundation just
like coverage wise in the shade and
everything I don't think you really need
this one but this is a high-end option
next is the Sephora airbrush foundation
this is the perfection mist airbrush
foundation in the lightest shade
actually recently got this this is the
only foundation I'm going to mention
that isn't full coverage I think I'm
going to have a whole other full review
coming on this product I watched a bunch
of reviews and everyone was saying it
was full coverage on my skin with my
acne scarring and stuff this definitely
wasn't full coverage the most I could
get it to was like a medium coverage and
I was with two layers is more for
someone who wants just like a light
quick application if you have freckles
and you just want to cover up some
redness but you don't want to like fully
cover your freckles this would probably
be a good option for you you can either
spray on the back of your hand or
palette and like dip your brush in and
apply it or you can just spray it
directly on your face I actually found
the best coverage just spraying it
straight on my face the shade is
definitely light enough we have the YSL
this is called fusion ink foundation
this is in the shade b10 porcelain this
is definitely the most high
foundation i own i think this retails
for about sixty bucks again i have a
full review on this product i always go
back to this when i just want something
lightweight it just looks great on the
skin it doesn't look like you're wearing
any product it literally feels like air
on your face
I usually just brush it on or we'll put
some on the back of my hand and then
apply it with a brush and look at this
gold cap you can't go wrong last product
I'm gonna mention is Kat Von D lock-it
tattoo foundation this is in the shade L
for you too
they discontinued this for a while and
it just came back like a few months ago
I'm only mentioning this because it is
really freaking light I'm not a huge fan
of this foundation just because it looks
really heavy and cakey on my skin mixing
it in with stuff it's okay but I
wouldn't wear this on its own but some
people do love this so I feel like it
might just be one of those foundations
that's kind of personal preference which
is why I want to throw it in here get a
sample what is on my lip get a sample
from Sephora you might really like it
and it might work out great for you
alright so those are all my foundation
picks I know finding foundation for pale
skin is like one of the hardest things
makeup wise I feel like it's just really
trial and error try out some stuff keep
your receipts you can always return from
Sephora and the drugstore you try
something out and it doesn't work for
your skin return it try the next one if
you're a pale princess rocket lawnmowers
not everyone has pale skin and you're
special and you're unique and you should
embrace it if you guys liked this video
and it was helpful for you give it a
thumbs up so I know love you guys thanks
for watching and see you in my next
video bye
