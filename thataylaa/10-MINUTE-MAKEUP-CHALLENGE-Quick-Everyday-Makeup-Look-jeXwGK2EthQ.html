shit's getting real all right we are in
a new location and well I'm in my living
room right now haven't you had a sip of
coffee yet today so this is gonna be fun
I think there are actually so few things
in life better than coffee all right so
today we're going to be doing the 10
minute makeup challenge I have all of my
crap laid out right here so I have all
my products laid out got all of my
brushes are here I think I have
everything we'll find out I haven't done
any kind of challenge videos before let
me know if you guys like these and you
want to see more okay the only time I
actually use the timer on my phone is
when I do laundry and I try and tie
myself to see how fast I could fold my
laundry 10 minutes this just got real we
need to roll up the leopard robe shit's
getting real so I have the thing on I
don't know if you guys can see that I
have the time around 10 minutes we're
gonna go ready set go okay it's starting
I'm starting out with primer this is the
makeup from our smoothing primer that
looks like it hasn't been used in like a
year coming out ball boy Lee ooh this
looks good
I've only used this a couple times and I
remember it being like super fast dry it
smells like a frickin candle or
something okay the foundation I'm using
the makeup Trevor stick foundation
because this is like the quickest goal
coverage application of life
what are we just gonna brush pencil it
on there and also like one of the only
foundations that I don't have to mix the
shades is okay on its own oh she's got
that brush in there as well
this is a lot more nerve-wracking than
it looks when you watch these videos
back I challenge all of you to do the 10
minute makeup challenge on your own
special pretty good if you can get a
good routine down in 10 minutes
like shit you're set for life we have 8
minutes and 30 seconds left what the
hell are you spend a minute and a half
on foundation of fragrance all right we
need to step it up they do not account
for coffee breaks in this time okay
foundations done I'm done with concealer
this is the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer and I feel like the fastest
way to blend this out is with a brush
doesn't give as little coverage but
that's okay
this is the pure mineral instruction
thing is one their new brushes and it's
actually the perfect size for blending
out foundation I mean by the way I have
the mic on right now I hope it's not
static again I don't know what's going
on with it okay okay we're gonna set the
under-eye concealer something is in my
eyeball not quite sure what it is oh no
I forgot my concealer brush
okay we're using this this is the elf
brush so under I real good my Physicians
Formula cracking powder I feel like the
brows are gonna be my downfall okay
let's let the rest of my face because
this foundation definitely needs to be
set on my skin wants to gets really oily
throughout the day using Mac some kind
of cover Studio Fix all right face is

Maybelline I behold a review on this
