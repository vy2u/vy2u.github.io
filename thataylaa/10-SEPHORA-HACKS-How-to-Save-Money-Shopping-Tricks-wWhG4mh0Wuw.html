get a good thumbnail epic failure
alright so today we're going to be
talking about ten Sephora packs if
you're like me and you spend your entire
life savings at Sephora
hopefully these tips help they might
just make your addiction worse who knows
we are just going to hop right into it
so number one for ten dollars a year you
can basically buy free unlimited two day
flash shipping on support website I feel
like this is such an easy way to save
money on Sephora every time you make a
purchase you're basically paying like
six to ten dollars and shipping so to
pay ten dollars and have unlimited
shipping for an entire year is amazing
hack number two Sephora has their
perfume sampler sets and I always looked
at those and thought why the heck would
someone pay $65 for 10 like mini samples
that you can get for free basically in
that kit they give you a free voucher
for a full-size perfume so you can try
out all the different perfumes and if
there's one that you decide that you
like you just take it into Sephora and
they'll give you a free perfume
sometimes the full-size perfume that you
pick out is actually worth more than the
cost of perfume sample set so you can
save some money and it's just good way
if you're a perfume addict like I am you
can try out a bunch of different
perfumes and figure out what you like
and what you don't like my third hack is
using eBay so you guys know I'm obsessed
with eBay I use Ebates
every single time I shop online you can
basically get cash back every single
time you shop online Sephora using eBay
s-- so what you do is you sign up if you
go on there they give you a free $10
gift card first time you sign up and you
literally just get cash back for your
entire purchase they do do double they
do do they do do double cashback days so
if you purchase an online order on
Sephora during that period you'll get
double the cashback who doesn't like
that leave a link in the description box
if you want to sign up for Ebates you do
get your $10 off gift card thing the
first time that you sign up so that's
always exciting
number four everyone knows that you can
always get three free samples every time
you shop online but you can actually get
four Sephora has a weekly promo page
which I'll link in the description box
and basically it tells you the code for
the week you can get a free deluxe sized
sample so every time you order make sure
you select your three
samples and also put in that code and
it'll give you another free sample on
the topic of free samples number five
you can get any free samples that you
want when you walk into the Sephora
store you can get samples a foundation
to try out you can get samples of
perfumes of skincare you can literally
get samples of anything there's a Sunday
Riley product you want to try out or an
expensive skin care thing so you're not
sure if you want to spend the full
amount yet ask for a sample they'll give
you a little sample cup and you can try
it out number six I feel like a lot of
people don't know about sephora's return
policy the return policy is basically
like our guys and Nordstrom's where you
can return whatever the you want
whenever you want you don't even need to
have a receipt you can give them your ID
but you can basically return anything at
any time so if you use up half a product
you technically in return it I'm not one
to do that but if you do try out a
foundation or something and you're not a
fan of it return it I definitely do that
when I'm not happy with the product I'm
not going to pay $50 for something that
I don't like so if they have that return
policy you definitely feel free to
utilize it I usually try to keep all my
receipts so that I can return it with
the receipt if you don't use the receipt
they'll just have to get your ID and
return it that way number seven this is
one more for these Sephora noobs or
those who haven't spent their entire
paycheck at Sephora yet definitely
become a Sephora beauty insiders
basically their point reward system the
points never expire and you can
eventually become a VIP or VIP Rouge
which basically means that you get
access to different sales and different
deals if you're going to be spending the
money anyways you might as well be
getting some kind of credit and rewards
for all the money you're giving them
number nine
they actually have hidden sales in
stores I say hidden because you actually
have to sometimes look like they put
them in bizarre places but they're
basically like the endcap sales on the
ends of the rows you'll see a little
clearance section and can actually get
some pretty good deals on there and they
do change out those products every
single week that's a number 9 that was
number eight number eight or number nine
whichever one I didn't do yet I feel
like I always knew this before I had
semiannual sales I never really realized
when they actually took place I kind of
just wait for the email to show up so
their semi-annual sales are in April in
November so if you have stuff that
you're wanting to buy make a list and
save it for those times
you can say between ten and twenty
percent depending on your status of
beauty insider aka how much money you've
given them over the years when you're
making a big purchase fifteen or twenty
percent can actually be a lot so if you
can hold out wait for the semi-annual
sales my left tack is that if you are in
store and there's something you want to
buy and it ends up being out of stock in
store they will actually order it for
you in store and ship it to you for free
if you don't have the free two-day flash
shipping then you can order something in
store and they'll ship it to you for
free so those were all of my tips slash
