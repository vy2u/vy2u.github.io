days of foundation this is where I try
out a new foundation every single day
for 15 days I just got back from LA last
night feeling good feeling ready to film
if I look exactly the same right now is
the last haul video it's because I'm
filming these in the same day so day
five let's do this we're gonna be
talking about the model's own runway
matte foundation smooth finish that
saves face seems like something's
missing there I'm not sure how I feel
about models own packaging I like the
teal I like the fade but it kind of
mines me of like limited to anyone
remember those velcro t-shirts those
were the I know there's something
about the packaging that just reminds me
of like teeny bopper kind of makeup
you've never heard of models own I
believe their UK brand that's now
carried in Ulta drugstore prices this
foundation retails for $11.99 and you
get one fluid ounce of product which is
standard it comes in only eight shades I
picked up the two lightest shades which
are 0-1 porcelain and 0-2 bisque um
insert swatches right here so you can
see what these two shades look like
compared to some of the other friend
agents that I own all right so swatch
time right here is the model's own
runway foundation in 0-1 porcelain which
is clearly very fair which is awesome
next over is bisque 2 this is the second
lightest shade next over is der McCall
2:08 pur cosmetics bear doll and
porcelain Urban Decay Naked skin and 0.5
and Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
in 110 so as you can see from the
swatches there's a pretty freakin big
jump between those two shades since it
does only come in eight shades you might
need to buy a couple shades and mix them
there's pretty much no description of
this foundation both on Ulta and model
zone website it says bold brave and
British get totally even with this
weightless model zone matte runway
foundation that will take you seamlessly
from a.m. to p.m. that's literally all
it says on the box it just says get even
with this weightless matte liquid
foundation so that's all we know about
it so days one through four will be
linked down below in a playlist if you
want to see what I think of the model's
own runway matte foundation and how it
applies and wears throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching I'm excited to be filming right
now it feels like I've been gone more
than two days so it's 8:57 9 a.m. in the
morning right now I woke up at 6:30 you
don't ask me how it took me this long to
be sitting here now so Barney wash
moisturize primed my face these will be
listed down below I'm gonna use my
morphe sponge on one side of my face
this is dampened by the way every single
time I use it I'm going to try my Sigma
f80
black booty on the other side this is
one of my go-to foundation brushes I'm
two different shades here you guys will
have already seen swatches I haven't
seen the swatches yet looking at this
though bisque looks way too dark for me
so I'm gonna start out with porcelain I
might end up mixing in a little bit of
bisque actually just ordered this shade
first and then I put it against my face
and I thought it might be way too light
so I think I'm gonna have to mix in a
little bit of this one to me that looks
like there's about five shades in
between these two maybe I'll just cheeks
watch this first this ooh
that's light folks ooh that's very light
okay so for me I'm gonna have to mix
that right now since I have a bit of
color looks like you kind of need to
shake this starting out about half half
let's see what shade this makes dab this
on who feels pretty thick over that
might be too dark still looks pretty
yellow I'm gonna go into this sponge on
this side I think that shade concoction
I got was pretty close let's say you can
build this up but with the sponge on
this one layer looks like about medium
coverage and still see a bunch of stuff
coming through but let's see what kind
of coverage we get with the brush here's
the word feels pretty thick like it's
not the easiest one doh
it's not really like gliding on the skin
or anything okay so I got about the same
coverage I'm gonna see if this is
buildable because right now this isn't
enough coverage for me so I'm just gonna
go in with a little bit more at the
brush on this side just on the areas I
need more coverage down here looks like
it's building pretty well it's not
getting kicky or dry looking or anything
I'm just using a small amount of product
I'm not doing like a full-on second
layer for the forehead just so it
doesn't look more textured I'm gonna go
in with this sponge and add a little bit
more it's whatever's leftover on my
palate at this point I can't tell if I
like the sponge or brush better with
this one it's looking pretty much
exactly the same so I think you could go
with either right now looking at it up
close it doesn't look like it's majorly
emphasizing my texture or anything on
this half of my face my forehead it
doesn't look bad right now but I can
already see it starting to like settle a
little bit got a little bit more
coverage it's not like total block out
kind of coverage at this second layer
you can still kind of see things coming
through but it's enough coverage for me
I've been sitting here staring on my
face for like two minutes trying
see what I think of this it doesn't look
bad and doesn't look good it's just kind
of like very average looking to me right
now right now it's okay we'll see how it
wears it definitely dried down doesn't
feel tacky or anything this one looks
like one of those foundations to me that
if I put a powder on top it might just
totally cake up but I don't think I'm
gonna powder my face with this one so
we're gonna call the check-in time 9:10
a.m. I'm going to do the rest my makeup
and I'll be right back oh my eye is
twitching okay so it's ten o'clock so
it's been on for about 50 minutes so far
I'm gonna show you guys what it looks
like in natural lighting right now the
only thing I noticed right now is around
my nose on the right side it's kind of
creasing and on my forehead there's like
a little spot where it looks really dry
and patchy almost like where something
rubbed against it but I don't even think
I'd touch my forehead right there so I'm
not sure what's happening right there
but it does look like it's doing
something funky up there it's starting
to settle into my lines a little bit on
my forehead overall I do like how it
looks better with the rest of my makeup
on right now but don't necessarily like
it at this point so we'll see how it
wears but on the rest of my face let me
tell you what's on it I'm actually gonna
film a second video right now which you
guys will have already see and it'll be
the makeup clothes haul so I tried out a
couple things I'm gonna be holding in
that video for my contour and all of my
eye shadows I tried out this Tarte
palette this is the clay play face
shaping palette and so far I really like
this I've done more in depth about it in
the haul video so I'm not gonna do it
here but I like it blush I use Tarte
doll face so for my face highlight I'm
using the Burberry number three fresh
glow highlighter and pink pearl look at
how beautiful the design on this thing
is I don't know why I'm showing you guys
this all again because you've already
seen in the whole check out the video
lips I tried out this Avon lipstick they
sent a ton of them this is in the
shade naturally nude and I like the tone
of this it has a very satin kind of
finish to it it has a tiny bit of color
pot fairy floss gloss over top but it
was pretty glossy on its own like the
shade of this it's a little bit sheer
like you kinda have to build it up and
this smell smells like how you would
picture Avon lipstick smelling and
lashes are pure trendsetter this box has
seen better days
the check-in time is 910 I'll see you
guys in a few hours and natural lighting
okay so it's 2:10 right now it has been
on for 5 hours
I'm feeling pretty shitty right now so
I'm gonna make this super quick check-in
and then go lay down I'm not getting
super oily or anything but definitely
around my nose
in this area again it just is like
majorly creasing doesn't look that great
and then my forehead just looks pretty
bad it's like getting all dry and
basically just coming off and I haven't
really been like touching my face a
whole lot or anything
certain parts I just noticed are coming
off a little bit and look a bit dry like
on my nose too I'm also getting creasing
on my neck I noticed which is really
bizarre never had a foundation crease on
my neck like where I blended it down to
cover my acne so as a little update
hopefully I will see you guys at the end
of the night it's now 7:20 so the
Foundation's been on for ten hours and
my imitrex kicked in thank God I was
able to eat and edit so I feel okay
right now foundations not looking good
it's like worn off basically on the
perimeter of my face Wow I feel like I
haven't used that word perimeter in like
ten years
perimeter one for area and perimeter
okay anyways my foreheads a bit oily on
the center it doesn't look like it's
breaking down on the center of my
forehead but it's definitely breaking
down around my mouth area chin down here
and then all over at the top of my
forehead yeah
it just looks like it's breaking down a
bit around here around my notes looks
pretty bad this has been separating and
broken up all day right there but I mean
like that again it doesn't look too bad
on the center of my face
it's just like you can see all over here
it just rubs off super easily I'm not
even rubbing my face and just the
texture of it like feels a little bit
heavy to me this one didn't wear the
best on my skin maybe with a different
primer underneath so we'll try that
don't absolutely hate it don't love it I
feel like this is like than the theme
for the first five days of videos so
hope you guys liked this video and are
excited for 15 days foundation if you
are don't forget to give it a thumbs up
it helps me out love you guys thanks for
watching see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
