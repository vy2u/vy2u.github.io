talking about super super super almost
white foundations if you are the palest
of pale princesses out there this one is
for you so in my time right now I just
wrapped up 15 days of foundation
yesterday supposed to be relaxing right
now and like not filming but here we are
if you missed that series I'm going to
link it down below because that series
hopefully will be helpful for you but
basically I tried out a new foundation
every single day for 15 days and one of
the questions that I received the most
during that series was what are the
palest
paleis foundations that you own ones
that are like too light for me so if
you're even lighter than I am and you've
tried foundations that I've tried and
they're like still too dark on you then
hopefully these are some options for you
because 99% of foundations I'm going to
talk about today are actually too light
for me I struggled for years before
YouTube finding a foundation that was
light enough for my skin tone there at
high school I had basically like an
orange face going on because there just
weren't a whole lot of products for
people with pale skin now almost ten
years later I feel like a lot of brands
are starting to recognize that there are
other skin tones besides 10 middle
shades whether you're super dark or
super fair I hope the brands start
recognizing that there is a market for
that we can also help create that market
so if you ever have a brand that you
wish came out with a foundation a
lighter shade tweet them we do have the
power as consumers to influence
decisions so I believe that before we
get into this I just want to say that
you should go check out my video on how
to love your pale skin because it took
me a long time to get to the point where
I'm at now where I actually love my pale
skin and enjoy and embrace it if you're
in the same boat there
I definitely recommend checking out that
video if you are a pale princess and
you're stumbling across this video I do
have a ton of videos for people with
pale skin and have a whole playlist that
I'll link down below in the description
box where you can go through and check
out some of those videos but I hope it
helped some of you guys alright so let's
get into as all the foundations are
actually sitting behind this chair great
decision Taylor so if you have a super
pale skin one of the most helpful things
that I found is family
mixers I've talked about Manic Panic
dreamtone for years now three years ago
I did a review on this so long queue
down below everything I'm going to talk
about today I'm going to link down below
so make sure you check the description
box but this is basically a vegan
foundation mixer you have to be careful
with the way that you mix foundation
mixers you don't want to be mixing an
oil-based product with a water-based
product because oil and water don't mix
science the NYX pro foundation mixer is
another option I have like five other
foundation mixers I am going to be doing
a whole video on foundation mixers and
how to use them properly and things like
that it just takes a while for me to
test all them but foundation mixers are
an option if you are like hardcore
struggling finding pale foundation or if
you have ones that are just a little bit
too dark for you that you've already
bought and you want to make work these
can be really great options so I just
watched all these foundations for you
guys we have 13 foundations to talk
about today so I'm going to show you an
overview of all the swatches here so you
can kind of see which ones do you think
might work for you then I'm going to go
a little bit more in-depth on the actual
product and touch on some of the pros
and cons not all these are foundation
formulas that I love and that I hundred
percent recommend I want to make that
clear at the beginning these are just
products that I found to be light enough
so if you are like majorly struggling
you might not find your ideal foundation
formula and shade but you might be able
to take that foundation and use a
different primer or powder or mix it in
with something to make it a foundation
that you really love not recommending
all these formulas as we go through
these I will tell you which ones kind of
stand out to me and which ones I like a
little bit more and which ones I'm not
the biggest fan of alright we've got an
armful of swatches so let's do this this
first one right here is the Mehran
celebrity pro in the shade light one
this one is super pale definitely one of
the palest out of all of these
foundations
this is L'Oreal True Match in the shade
w1 so this is of course the Kat Von D
locket tattoo foundation in l42
this is a new hourglass vanish stick
foundation in the shade Blanc this is
the Lancome teint Idole ultra foundation
in zero nine zero which actually looks
pretty dark compared to the rest of you
so I'm looking at it this is the
illuminator foundation in the lightest
shade
here's a hard candy glamoflauge in the
shade porcelain Marc Jacobs remarkable
in ten Illamasqua rich liquid foundation
in the shade 115 this is the Rimmel stay
matte foundation in 10 cover FX CLIC
stic foundation this is my shade and 10
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation in
the shade Y 2:05 and then last is the
Revlon Colorstay whipped foundation in
the lightest shade and that one is
pretty dark compared to some of these so
I wanted to throw it in there cuz I feel
like that's one that a lot of people
have just so you can see comparisons
against other shades so here's all of
them side by side alright so first off
here we have the mayor on I still don't
know how to say this brand marijuana
Libre HG Pro cream makeup in the shade
light one so this is more of a theatre
makeup brand this retails for 1450 I use
this foundation in a shadow and shoes
video if you want to see how it applies
I've only used it that one time because
this was way too pale for me this is a
super super white pale cream foundation
you basically apply this with a sponge
it has really good coverage and actually
has a really pretty finish in my opinion
it is a pretty like moisturizing creamy
dewy foundation so if you're oily I
probably wouldn't recommend this one if
you have dry skin this might actually
work for you I would say dry and normal
skin only so next we have L'Oreal true
match foundation which is like a cult
favorite drugstore foundation this is in
the shade w1i the shades c1 c1 actually
matches me a lot better than w1
definitely isn't as light as some of the
other foundations I'm going to show you
but since this is from the drugstore
it's super easily accessible if you have
different undertones in this a w1n 1 and
C 1 so I would just say pick up all
three you play around with them and see
which one works you can try mixing them
and just return whichever ones don't
match your face out of all the formulas
I'm going to talk about this is probably
one of my favorite it just gives you the
prettiest low it looks really natural on
the skin next up we have the Kat Von D
lock-it tattoo foundations this is the
most widely known pale foundation now
this is in the shade L 42 it's full
coverage has 24-hour wear transfer
resistant matte finish this has a super
matte finish this formula I'm not a fan
of I mentioned that before in a few
other videos just too matte and heavy
and cakey on my skin I only use
us to mix in with other foundations it
also is way too late for me I have heard
that the two shades above this have a
totally different formula than the
lightest shade l42
think I am going to try the second or
third to lightest just to see if the
formulas different see if I like it a
little bit better but if you're super
pale this one is extremely pale a lot of
people love this foundation so this is
just my opinion you might love this you
might hate it like always I suggest you
guys check out a bunch of other reviews
form your own opinions these are just
one person's opinion me I think that I
love you might hate something that I
hate you might love speaking of things
that I hate this is the hourglass vanish
stick foundation I did a whole review on
this during 15 days of foundation this
is supposed to be a full coverage
long-lasting stick foundation it just
breaks down horribly on me throughout
the day tried it with different powders
primers it doesn't work for me however
this shade of Blanc and the shade
alabaster are both slightly too light
for me Blanc is extremely light I do
commend hourglass for coming out with a
shade this leg I think it's awesome
formula sex in my opinion but I love
that they came out with a good variety
of shades so if you saw that review and
you think you might be able to make it
work on your skin might be worth giving
it a go strong might about a fan of this
actual product but the shade is super
pale alright on to one that has a light
shade and a good formula this is the
Lancome 10 adult ultra 24 hour makeup a
lot of you guys have asked me to do a
for review on this product I do have
like two or three shadow moves videos
where I put it on and I basically give
you kind of my thoughts on it it is to
Mac for my liking but if you're someone
who is pale and likes a matte finish
where it doesn't look cakey and it
doesn't feel heavy this one is really
nice it's long lasting is too light for
me you have to mix this one it has more
of a pink undertone in it so this is the
illuminator moisturizing mineral
foundation dewy finish I've never seen
this talked about on YouTube randomly
found this online when just doing
research I haven't tried this yet I
think I'm going to do a first impression
on this one let me know if you guys
would want to see that but from what I
read it's supposed to be really nice
formula it does look pretty light just
watching it on my skin it definitely
feels very moisturizing
let me know if you guys don't want to
see a full review on this guy next up is
one that I feel like
a ton of my channel this is the hard
candy glamoflauge foundation in the
shade porcelain I love that hard candy
came out with the shade stocked up on
this I have like three bottles of this
product this is under ten bucks it's
super pale it has good coverage and it
is too light for me on its own so this
is one that I do like mixing in with
other products for me if you don't have
dry skin I think this would be totally
fine wearing alone before this
foundation came out there glamoflage
concealer was something that I actually
used to mix in a lot with products
before I discovered foundation mixers
that has really good coverage it's super
light as well so if you just have the
concealer you could definitely mix that
in with other foundations that you own
but this one is just a good product to
have for mixing for on its own it's
cheap I would definitely recommend that
you guys pick this one up next up is
probably my favorite not probably
definitely my favorite out of all these
is the Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation
in the shade ten ivory eye the shade 10
and the shade 1212 is a little bit too
dark for me 10 is way too light on its
own this is definitely one of my
favorite foundations ever made it has
such a beautiful finish most full
coverage foundation that I've ever owned
has this like dropper applicator thing
and you literally need the tiniest bit
usually just use my finger and go around
the cap and then put that on a
foundation palette and mix a tiny bit in
this is a pricey product but you need
such a small amount that I feel like
this would last you for forever if you
don't want a super full coverage
foundation just mix this in with your
moisturizer mix it in with a little bit
of an illuminator if you want to you
definitely share this down just apply
less use a sponge there are ways to get
less coverage out of this but if you're
someone like me who has a ton of acne
and scarring to cover up this one is
amazing and I think it's worth every
penny next up is the Illamasqua a rich
liquid foundation in the shade RF 115
this one was products that has just been
sitting in my foundation drawer for
forever I think I use this in a shadow
and she moves years ago when I was still
in the college house this one I feel
like I definitely need to give another
go Alaska does make a skin base in like
a pure white shade this one I remember
trying this like one or two times and
the five days
kind of my dramatic at one do you like
it was just too thick and heavy for me
but you want to try mixing with this in
because it has really good coverage and
is super light this is definitely one
lightest ones I have here a lot of
people like this formula so I'm
definitely going to give this another go
I might use this in an upcoming a shadow
inch mace or something this is the
Rimmel stay matte liquid mousse
foundation I did a review on this a long
time ago this is in the shade 10 light
porcelain I have the shade zero nine one
I think it is there a nine zero actually
swatch them both next to each other and
this one looked lighter to me this is a
lightweight shine control makeup I do
like this when I'm feeling super oily
this is very very very pink challenge
this is a drugstore product under $10 if
you need to pale pink toned one try this
one I stuff I have the cover FX cover
click foundation in the shade and ten
this is like so baby so many I did a
full review on this during the 15 days
of foundation series I wanted to include
this one because I think this is one of
those that is kind of like on the border
this might be a little bit dark for some
of you super pale people but for me I
feel like I can wear it I just need to
wear a lot of bronzer and like a darker
powder to warm up my face it looks like
you don't get a lot of products with the
sowing retails for $18 I broke down the
ounces in the price in that video good
coverage nice formula I do like this one
next is Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation in the shade Y 205 this is a
very pale foundation this is a good one
if you're like looking at all these
options and you think some of them might
be too full coverage for you you just
want a good skin like everyday
foundation I would say go with this one
you can build that for me it's a little
bit too sheer right now help my acne and
stuff I need to cover up you can build
this up I like this 50 billion times
better than the original Make Up For
Ever HD foundation that one didn't work
for me at all the lighter shade was like
straight-up orange on me and just the
finish of it in the formula I was not a
fan of the original one but the Ultra HD
is really nice has more of like a satin
finish I think this could work for dry
skin if you have oily skin if you set
this with a good powder let me know if
you guys want a pale powder video I
personally like mixing this in with
foundations I would probably mix this in
with something like the Kat Von D lock
it or the illamasqua foundation last up
this is the Revlon
a whipped cream makeup in the shade 110
ivory Revlon Colorstay the original
formula and the whipped foundation are
both pretty light for the drugstore if
you're trying to find a drugstore
foundation that's pale these definitely
aren't the palest palest that's my word
definitely aren't the most pale out of
all the foundations I'm showing you
today but I just want to throw this one
in for comparison because a lot of
people own this foundation and on the
liquid version so you can see how the
shade compares to everything else this
is a pretty pale foundation so if you're
like somewhere in the middle between me
and super pale wouldn't it suggest this
for dry skin since it is like a mousse
II kind of formula is one those
interesting ones I feel like some people
think it's super lightweight you can't
feel it personally on me I feel like I
can definitely feel it but that's
probably just because I put a lot of
product on to cover everything up it is
waterproof though it's a good summer
foundation if you get oily and this is
just a good affordable drugstore option
so like I said let me know down below if
you guys would rather see a foundation
mixer video first or a pale powder video

powder collection if you're new here
