Mika's on got coffee alright so today is
the day it is officially the
announcement video first season were
telling them seasons now why not
season 3 the third series of 15 days of
foundation so pretty much since the last
series which was back in November
project Leda sure and I have been
working on something very exciting for
you guys this time around probably get
excited 5000 times in this video but I
am very excited to finally share it with
you guys there's actually two things
going on this time around but before we
get into that I'm going to backtrack a
little bit because I know there are a
lot of new BAE readers on board this
time around so if you're new if this is
your first 15 days of foundation series
where you're watching it in real time
comment down below say hey so super
quick I'm going to go over the basics 15
days of foundation this time around is
April 5th to the 19th I already
announced two dates back in the
foundation Friday video so 15 days of
foundations where I do a new first
impression video on a foundation
obviously every single day for 15 days
this is the third series I'm going to be
doing I do it about every 4 months I
have playlist for both other series I
mean putting these videos for the new
series and playlist as well so
everything is always down below words
man think of trying to say each sentence
25 times today what happened was the
first series I just did foundation
videos is a good time it was super fun
you guys seemed to really like it so I
decided to continue it on my channel
wanted to do something more with a
series of second time around so I got
involved with Project Beauty share
they're basically a nonprofit that helps
women in transition you can donate any
of your youth makeup there they
sanitized it i gene items beauty
products and distribute them to eleven
different shelters in the state of
Washington they are trying to go
national they're in the process of
dealing with grants and all that kind of
stuff like I said in the other videos
this isn't just makeup a lot of these
women are coming from abusive
relationships have
and homeless are just in a transitional
point in their lives and so sometimes
makeup can give you the confidence to
feel like you again and be able to get a
job and go to a job interview so just
know that whether you're mailing a
project or you're contributing through
this series which I will tell you guys
about it's greatly appreciated by me and
by project B chair and by the women
receiving these products so many of you
guys in the last six months have sent in
donations to them which has just been
incredible to see Julie the founder of
project a share will send me texts
photos of cars that you guys have sent
in and just the sweetest letters I'm
start crying
it's just amazing to actually be able to
see some kind of impact was just been
one of those experiences for me where
just makes all this real so thank you to
everyone who's gone through their makeup
and sent in packages to project B share
I actually got to go visit their
headquarters a couple months ago I did a
whole vlog on it I will put it in a
little eye over here if you missed it
but it was just amazing to be able to
see the warehouse where all this goes
down and just meet all the women behind
project B to share their incredible to
completely volunteer-run nonprofit so
these women are doing this on top of
their normal jobs they just feel so
grateful that somehow my past crossed
with theirs because they really are such
a great organization and genuinely care
about what they're doing for their
community last time around we did
t-shirts and we're in mine right now in
honor of today we raised over 1,600
dollars and we're taking it to the next
level this time so a bunch of your buns
last time around because I did the
t-shirts through Amazon and
International shipping was not available
this time around we have new t-shirts
International shipping is available I'm
going to get into the t-shirts after but
I'm going to talk about the thing that
I'm really excited about and we've been
working really hard on shout out to
Janet at project B share because this
has been a process so we are doing a
makeup sale 100% of the proceeds from
the sale are going to project that you
share it's going to be on there eBay
page the first 50 people who purchase
anything from the eBay site will get a
handwritten note for me there are 11
different brands who have agreed to
participate in this whether it's in the
form of product donation going directly
to shelters or product donation for this
eBay page for you guys to purchase so
huge thank you to all the brands
involved I'm going to read them off now
there are some really great brands in
here and there are cruelty free options
do shop cruelty-free so huge thank you
to Maybelline Oprah cosmetics morphe
salon pur cosmetics misha Catrice
cosmetics la girl elf Sigma brushes and
Lola who donated five hundred tampons to
the shelters which is incredible tampons
are one of the items that project Beauty
share is always low in supply on and
hygiene products aren't really something
that we think about a lot of times is
something that we just take for granted
but pad donations and tampons are always
really useful in something that project
we share also collects so huge thank you
to Lola for donating tampons to the
shelters let's talk about the eBay page
and how this is actually working so
there are two hundred thirty different
listing that you guys can purchase from
some of the products are bundled
together so if you want like a bigger
bundle you can get that some of them are
just sold individually so even though
all these are brand new products we went
through and priced all them at a really
good discounted rate so it's actually
cheaper than what you can buy it for on
most retailers some of my favorite
products are listed in here at the pier
cosmetics bear doll foundation easel and
hair products there are some really good
stuff going on in the sale the eBay page
is going to be live as soon as day one
of fifteen days of foundation goes lives
so on April 5th this coming Wednesday at
6 p.m. Pacific time by the way every
video is going up at 6 p.m. 5th time I
don't think I said that that is when the
eBay page will be live so I'm going to
leave a link for it down below so you
guys can bookmark it and you're ready to
shop as soon as it goes live so
fortunately we could not offer
international shipping for the eBay page
customs and everything it just didn't
work out I have another option for those
of you who want to get involved and who
aren't living in the u.s. in every
series at the end of the series I do a
wrap up video where I basically rank two
foundations 1 to 15 so the eBay site is
going to be live until the Rapa video
which is going to be on Friday April
28th so we're going to do our best to
get everything shipped out very quickly
from eBay keep in mind that there is
only one amazing woman running this eBay
page but she's going to do her best to
ship everything out as quickly as
possible if you have any eBay related
questions their contact infos on their
eBay page this is one of those things
that kind of seems super simple when it
goes up but the amount of coordination
and everything that went into this was a
lot so thank you so much project leader
for taking this on with me and for all
the
and for supporting us so I think that's
everything with the eBay site if I
missed anything all the information will
be down below in the description box but
let's move on to the second way that you
can get involved and that is through
t-shirts it's a new t-shirt design for
this series the t-shirts are being sold
on teespring and they're actually
available as soon as this video goes up
so when you guys are watching this right
now you can purchase a t-shirt they say
hell yeah it's 15 days of foundation so
hope you guys like the t-shirt design
I'm fan of it there are three styles
there's a unisex t-shirt which is a
little bit bigger and bagger if you want
to wear as like a sleep shirt or workout
shirt or if you're a man and you want to
purchase one there's also a women's kind
of more fitted tee and there's also a
crewneck hoodie which is my personal
favorite each of them come in two or
three colors I think the unisex one
comes in three colors the t-shirts come
in white and grey and it goes from size
small to five XL so hopefully there's a
size for everyone the way T spring works
is they ship out batches every three
days 100% of the proceeds from the
t-shirts are also going to project me to
share I don't have a sample to actually
wear and show you guys this time around
but as soon as mine comes in the mail
I'm going to be wearing it in a video
and I'll show it to you then but the way
teespring works I had to launch the
campaign before I could actually buy it
myself as soon as you get your t-shirt
in the mail make sure you tag me on
social use the hashtag 15 days of
foundation I would be screenshotting
some of your photos to include at the
end of each video so I have been
actually pre recording videos since a
couple weeks ago so I am full-on in it
right now you guys will be seeing the
first video next week on Wednesday this
is going to be the last video that I put
out before
tsking basic foundation starts so I
really hope you guys are excited about
the eBay sale and the t-shirts in just
15 days of foundation I'm stoked I hope
you guys are stoked like I'm forgetting
to say something so if you're excited
for 15 days of foundation make sure you
give this video a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the baby toe
family and subscribe make sure you also
have your notifications turned on
because YouTube is being YouTube lately
