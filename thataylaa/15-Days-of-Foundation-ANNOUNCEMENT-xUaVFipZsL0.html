project beauty share in this last year a
year ago in November Taylor found out
about us it has changed us forever for
the very good we are now receiving
donations from all over the nation and
actually from all over the world
all right I need like a chill pill right
now I'm so excited to film this I forgot
to turn on half my lights before I sat
down I was listening to some good old
pumpup music as I was getting ready I'm
stoked to finally tell you guys what
we've been working on in the past six
months I have a lot of info to tell you
guys but I'm gonna make this as quick
into the point as possible I have notes
here so everything I'm about to say is
important for the next series so I so
appreciate those of you guys who are
taking the time to watch this and watch
the whole thing every single one of your
questions about videos the series dates
the charity campaign going along with
this everything is going to be answered
in this video so definitely watch the
whole thing it's going to talk about
literally everything alright so starting
off with the basics the dates for the
next 15 days of foundation series season
5 is March 15th to the 29th it is a
great time to turn on the bail
notifications so you don't forget every
single day 6 p.m. Pacific time so 15
days of foundation is a series on my
channel that I've been doing for a few
years now where I try out a new
foundation every single day for 15 days
seeing your guys's response after the
first series I ever did was really neat
for me it was something where I felt so
connected to you guys I loved saying how
excited you got I wanted to kind of use
that momentum to do something with the
series that could make some kind of
impact so I reached out to a nonprofit
called Project Beauty share a couple
years ago I've been working with them
ever since I still vividly remember my
first call with Julie the founder of
project baby share and instantly I just
felt like it was gonna be a good thing
project be sure is a non-profit here in
Washington State they collect beauty
products hygiene products cosmetics they
basically sanitize everything and
distribute it to nonprofits that work
with homelessness abuse poverty women in
transition and families in need project
be sure is an amazing organization in
the past couple of years they've
received donations from you guys from
all over the world it's not just about
makeup they are giving them tools to
feel confident again a lot of these
women are coming out of homelessness are
trying to get jobs are trying to get
back up on their feet and being able to
shower and use soap and shampoo and
maybe put on some lipstick and mascara
after all of those things if you think
about it in your own life can help us to
feel more beautiful and confident in
whatever we're trying to do I've been to
the project Beauty share warehouse a
couple times I've seen everything with
my own eyes I know the women that worked
there there
credible I know what it's like to not
have things available to me such as
hygiene products and makeup and things
like that and when you're a struggling
mom and your spring three kids with no
child support and you're trying to help
get up on your feet
those things are hard to come by and I
have to rely on with kindness pranks but
there was nothing like project new you
share you know to help rajab you share
has received so many emails and messages
from you guys in different states and
country is saying you want to get
involved locally but you don't know how
this is our first campaign where we're
going national the during 15 days of
foundation season five that is what
season we are currently in there's a
whole charity campaign going along with
this called beauty wishes 2018 so myself
and project baby share have teamed up
with five different shelters across the
United States
they've all been vetted by project B to
share their great organizations a lot of
time thought and effort went into this
whole campaign then also four top brands
in the industry are involved and I'm so
thankful for their support thank you to
Maybelline Garnier color pop and Tampax
so I'm going to tell you how all of
these things are connected and what
we're actually doing so this campaign
has two different parts to it the first
part is on the 15th there will be a link
to a landing page a contest page in the
description box of day one to 15 days of
foundation I'm also going to add it into
this video on the 15th the page isn't
gonna be live until the 15th buydig the
little screen grab so you guys can see
kind of how this is gonna play out so on
this page you'll see the five shelters
safe horizon which is in New York
Lotus house shelter in Miami Florida the
y AR c in Houston Texas
Good Shepherd Center in Los Angeles and
breakthrough urban ministries in Chicago
Illinois so every single day for 15 days
you can head to this page vote one time
a day vote for a shelter one time of day
that you think deserves to win a $5,000
bonus prize and I'm going to be doing a
meet-up in that winning city so
whichever shelter wins that City I'm
gonna be flying to and doing a meet-up
I'm so excited I haven't done like an
official meetup in a big city ever I
don't think so if you're in New York
Chicago LA Houston
or Miami I'm going to be doing a meet-up
in one of those places if you're not in
one of those cities definitely please
still vote for the shelter that you
think deserves to win the grand prize of
$5,000 I'm gonna have the link to each
of them down below so you can go ahead
and check them out ahead of time and see
which one you might be interested in
voting in super easy to vote by the way
you just put in your email just so they
can identify that it's a real account
and that you can only vote one time a
day you're not gonna get spammed with
any emails you can opt into emails if
you want to but they're not gonna
automatically opt you in or anything
it's literally just to keep track of
votes also every single shelter that's
participating in beauty wishes is
getting a very gracious product donation
from those four brands that I mentioned
I mean you guys they're sending
thousands and thousands of product to
each shelter I wanted to give cool man
down we're just leaving him there I
wanted to give a special shout-out to
Tampax because they donated 17,000 boxes
of tampons tampons and feminine products
are one of the most needed items so the
fact that they were able to donate
17,000 so great if you are sending stuff
into Project Bashar ever by the way you
can also send in boxes of tampons and
pads anything like that
it didn't just donate makeup Garnier
sent a bunch of hair products shampoos
things like that so these are products
that people really need and that
shelters are constantly out of so thank
you to those four brands for believing
in me and project Bashar and what we're
doing here and being awesome enough to
donate thousands and thousands of
products these shelters so again the
contest page will be linked in every
single video you'll see in the
description box on the 15th I cannot
wait to see which shelter wins which
city I'll be doing a meet-up in I'm also
just excited to see which City really
comes together in rallies for this so
the second part of this campaign is
limited edition t-shirt design so 100%
of the proceeds of all these designs go
to project Beauty share so there's six
different designs and moso's come in two
different t-shirt styles just pending on
what you like the designs are super cute
and I'm sticking with the whole regional
theme so we have Midwest is best all the
way up the East Coast has my heart
West Coast best coasts the South stole
my heart and then a beauty wishes kind
of campaign t-shirt and certain styles
of the t-shirt go up to size five
sell and international shipping is
available so I wanted to make sure that
hopefully there's a size for you
everyone can participate if you are
international you know get whatever
t-shirt you're feeling whichever one you
like best you can always represent the
west coast here just saying these
t-shirts are alive right now when you
guys are seeing this video so there's a
link right at the top of the description
box where you can go purchase one I
wanted to do this ahead of the launch of
the series so that you guys will
hopefully have them in a couple weeks
and can kind of wear them throughout the
series over two years ago when I first
partnered with Padre Pio share we raised
one thousand three hundred sixty nine
dollars in May of 2017 so last year we
raised twelve thousand four hundred
sixty-five dollars and now in March of
2018 I think we can do twenty thousand
dollars so I think we can do it there's
a lot more of you now you gotta aim high
you know I'm saying mom you better get
your book club in on these twenty
thousand dollars I believe in us project
be sure especially in the last year has
been trying to kind of reach more people
across the US and $20,000 would
definitely be able to kind of kickstart
that I think when I get to open the
boxes and I see these notes these
handwritten notes not only the love for
Taylor and I know why because you know
I've actually got to meet her in person
and she is as lovely on the inside as
she is on the outside but to read these
notes and to hear your you know your
cries and pleas for well you know when
are you going to be in our town and
you going to be able to help you know
people in our city the answer is help is
on the way we are headed in that
direction because of your donations you
have you know can accountable to us into
the national spotlight and we are
getting larger donations from elf and
bigger you know companies that allow us
to not only shower our local women with
so many great products that we're now
distributing in Seattle in Central
Washington we want to share the love and
we want to spread the love with all of
you around the United States our
collaboration with Taylor is going to
allow us to do that I'm so happy with
how all the designs turned out I wanted
to say a huge thank you for Megan at
free fly designs for donating her time
and helping out with the designs for us
it was very kind of her and I think they
all turned out amazing any photos that
you guys post wearing the t-shirts with
the hashtag 15 days of foundation
hashtag beauty wishes 2018 tag me I'm
gonna be screenshotting those photos
sharing them on Facebook Twitter
Instagram stories snapchat so definitely
send me photos wearing your t-shirts
I love seeing guys in them sound kinda
creepy so now let's talk a little bit
about the actual 15 days of foundation
series so like usual there's gonna be 15
days in a row of videos I tried my best
this time to do half drugstore half
high-end foundations 15 is an odd number
so it's obviously gonna be one more than
the other but we're gonna have about
equal high end a drugstore so after the
series ends on the 29th I always wait
about a week a week and a half and do a
wrap up video so in the wrap up video
that's where I rank all of the
foundations 1 to 15
my favorite two least favorite kind of
go through different ways that I tried
them different powders different primers
whatever it is and tell you my final
thoughts on each foundation I have more
time than a week and have to test them
because I do pre record these videos a
lot so I'm having basically a month and
a half to kind of try these foundations
in between filming so in that wrap up
video which will be going up on April
9th that's where I'm gonna be announcing
the winning city the winning shelter at
the location and time of the Meetup all
of the meetup details everything is
gonna be in that video so definitely
stay tuned April 9th
that's the wrap up video on the contest
page that again will be live on the 15th
there's literally everything you need to
know there's a place to buy the t-shirts
theirs project Pierre's mailing address
you can mail in any of your gently used
makeup or beauty products the
365 days a year they're always accepting
donations from all over the world if you
do send in any kind of package the best
way to do it is in a flat-rate USPS box
because then you can just pack in the
makeup and makeup super heavy so you
don't end up paying a ton for shipping
just send it in a flat-rate USPS box
that's the way to go looking at my notes
I think I covered everything thank you
again to all the shelters all the brands
project Beauty share huge thank you to
project B share this has not been an
easy thing to coordinate if you guys
only knew the behind the scenes for this
