that was a really weird tone of voice
I'm doing the 19 random facts tag don't
really have any intro so let's just get
into this number one I currently have a
love affair with gushers when I run out
of them that's when I have to go to the
store not when I run out of milk when I
run out of my gushers when I'm in the
grocery store I reflect deep within and
think Taylor do you really need three
boxes of gushers no I don't I need for
number two I love camping just
everything about it the campfire the
smell if they made a candle out of the
campfire smell I'll be all over that
 number three
I hate golf what is so exciting
about hitting a ball and not being able
to see where it goes what's worse than
playing golf is watching it on TV
kill me now my parents will be like oh
yeah go tiger why are you watching golf
you're staring at a ball flying into the
sky and maybe making it into the
hole number four I'm currently learning
Arabic hard-ass language number five I
can't open boxes for the life of me
anything in the shape of 3d
square I can't open my brain doesn't
work in this shape it works like that
that was weird one time I ordered a
pizza and the guy was like oh can you
open your box and check to make sure
that this was the right this is the
right pizza and I was like you know what
sir I actually can't do that oh my I
can't I can't like visually open that
shape number six I don't believe in
awkwardness if you're in a room and
there's an awkward silence and someone's
like Oh
awkward just talk about food
everyone loves food and then the awkward
moments gone number seven I love called
duty black ops summer 2011 what up
number eight I have an obsession with
time I don't know how to describe it
but I feel like life is so valuable that
you really do need to live every day to
the fullest I just sounded like a
 fortune cookie but really I
don't know I'm that person who out of
all my friends always plans things just
because I feel like life's too short to
be sitting around like thinking oh we
should do this then plan it like
don't make it happen and do it
and not just like planning things but
just in general I think this comes from
this kind of goes with my next one but I
lived in Israel for four months I kind
of base everything off of like four
month periods now just because I did so
much in that four months feel like now I
just paired my four months in America
like in the u.s. to that and like what I
could be doing I guess if you want to do
something go do it and make it happen
because life isn't gonna go on forever
in like birthdays or 20 in June I'm
going to have a midlife crisis
that was kind of number nine in there
the Israel thing number ten I hate not
being able to eat I think that's one of
the worst feelings so get your wisdom
teeth out or when you get a filling or
something not being able to eat is
 horrible bro when I was like 12
and I got an expander um if you don't
know what expander is is that thing that
just sits on the roof of your
mouth my mom decided it would be a great
ass idea to make spaghetti that night
let's just picture for a second
twelve-year-old crying because her mouth
already hers eating trying to eat
spaghetti hanging out of my mouth stuck
in the expander not in my stomach
 you spaghetti I just love doing too
much number what is this 10 number 11 I
wouldn't want to win the lottery it's
knowing myself I need that motivation to
have something to work towards and I
feel like if I won the lottery I don't
know I just want to look back on my life
and be like wow I really accomplished
something and I'm proud of what I did
and I don't want to just be given all
that I don't know I guess if I did win
um I would like donate or something I
don't know like does that make sense I
just need that feeling of accomplishment
number 12
I make the baddest double chin you've
ever seen some days it's a triple gets
pretty intense if you want to see it
click the thumbs up button right down
there or here wherever it is 13 my
biggest pet peeve probably is when
you're sitting in the same room as
someone sitting at the table with them
and they have their headphones
in if I'm sitting next to you do you
really think I want to be
talking to the fork 14 if I was on my
deathbed I would ask for red velvet
cupcakes salt and vinegar chips and
burritos and I would feel bad
for whoever had to go over on and get
all that 14 people say I can't say
the word milk I don't hear it I don't
know how you're supposed to say it but I
say milk by the way can we just talk
about milk for a second why is it so
 good I literally go through
about five to eight cups of milk a day
that's probably really unhealthy but
whatever sixteen I curse if you watched
my earlier videos I didn't curse at all
just because I felt like I don't know
how people feel about cursing on YouTube
but then I got over it at the end of the
day what is important to me is being
myself on here and I was like you know
what I feel like I can't fully talk how
I talk and I just found sounded to like
not myself
I don't know number 17 I have really
 small feet like size 4 usually
just get kid shoes because they fit way
better than like trying to fit into a
size 5 what you can't find
anywhere can I point out but finding
heels is a bit to contact toddlers and
tiaras and see where they get their
shoes but seriously oh no he texts me
I'm making a video number 18 I have 10
piercings and working on the 11th
waiting for that paycheck and the last
one number 19 obviously I don't nor will
I ever understand the mustache
trend but the if a beard becomes a
trend I'm moving to a foreign country
