videos ever then you know what lush is I
feel like today I officially had my
YouTube rite-of-passage
by going to lush have you ever watched a
damn YouTube Beauty person without
seeing a lush haul I don't think so and
let me just start off by saying I take
baths about once every five years so I
didn't go to lush to get the bath bomb
 I wanted to find something for my
acne you just like a good cleanser and
stuff and I tweeted asking you guys what
your favorite products were and I got a
couple of those too
Thanks ignore the fact that I'm pasty as
 right now I really don't have an
excuse because it's August when I'm
filming this and if you're confused why
it's August then go watch the video link
down below but when you're watching this
I'm going to be in a foreign country
studying abroad so this is prerecorded
surprise but while we're on that note I
just wanted to say that this whole
pre-recording thing has been extremely
extremely difficult way harder than I
expected I apologize for the lack of
videos that have been going up but I
honestly have been trying my hardest
like I said in my time right now it's
August why the hell does this side
always get so light so basically I have
been doing a full-time internship and
then go on vacation for the rest of
August before I leave though basically
I've had very minimal filming time and
I've been trying to like pop out four
videos in a day anyways this will all be
explained in the study abroad video I
also wanted to let you guys know that I
appreciate all of you guys that are
watching me and I cannot wait to get
back into film
actual videos again like weekly videos
for you guys and yeah I literally just
have to chill here in this room staring
at the viewfinder
until this side of my face gets that
color and it's not happening so I don't
you know what this video is it's like
it's like my lush experience / halt / a
mini
talking vlog thing I don't know so let's
get on with the lush let me start just
off by saying that I went to the mall
with my aunt and my mom and my aunt
brought her damn dog and then she
thought it was a good idea to bring a
dog into lush so right off the bat the
sales people like we wanted to shoot us
and I don't know if you guys have had
this kind of experience in lush but they
are like overly helpful like it's the
kind of place where you don't want to
talk to a salesperson you're like let me
find my own and you go
smell bubble bars
so anyways I told the lady I wanted
something for my acne and I wanted a
good like facial cleanser this is how it
went basically she raped my arm by
testing products out if you like it that
much put it on your own damn arm so I
only got three things because they're a
lot more expensive than I expected I
don't know how people go in there and
buy like ten things well I guess if you
have a lot of money you could do that or
a job so the first thing I got was
recommended by you guys in this the
ocean salt face and body scrub and when
I read that this is a vodka-based scrub
sold
what's better than putting vodka on your
face so basically it has lime coconut
grapefruit sea salt and vodka and this
product was made by Coke eb8 really they
kind of just given her a name this is
just like it's as a face and body scrub
and it smells like tequila soap and lime
mixed it's like this bright aqua blue
color looks like one of those things
that you make in science class in like
seventh grade I usually don't like
natural smelling scents at all which is
why I was kind of skeptical about lush
holy this was 35 bucks apparently I
didn't look at the price tag right well
I better like this oh that's pretty cool
you can bring it says bring back five
black pots and get a free face oh and
get a fresh face mask free that's a
tongue twister that's pretty cool though
that's like Mac if
don't know Mac does like the certain
amount of lipstick tubes if you bring
them back you get a free lipstick I
really like when companies do that it's
a good incentive to recycle and I'll
save time the customer gets a free
product so that's gonna cool I'll let
you guys know if I like this my time
this video goes up I'll probably be
using it for like five months so get a
really good thorough what's that word
what the hell is that word opinion
that's not the word the next thing I got
is the grease lightning tea tree
cleanser and it has tea tree and witch
hazel gel to clean acne prone skin and
remove oil and basically it comes in
this little pump thing which I like that
it has a pump oh this was made by Sarah
who looks like a man you tested this on
my arm
of course what didn't she test on my arm
and it's kind of like a primer like
that's the consistency of it it feels
like a face primer and she said that I
could either mix it with my moisturizer
put it on for my moisturizer or also put
it on before bed or as a spot treatment
I know witch hazel and tea tree are both
really good ingredients for acne so I
wanted to try this and this was 1295 for
this little bottle which isn't that bad
for like an acne product if you consider
it that and yeah when you guys are
watching these videos I'm going to be
broken out and pretty much all of them
because they're recorded over a like
month and a half period so by the time
you're watching this know I'm probably
not still gonna have acne but it kind of
sucks because and all the tutorials I've
recorded you can see like the Hawaiian
Islands on my face oh they're not really
there for nine months for the people
complaining about that get the stick out
of your ass we've all had acne at some
point the last thing I got is just the
bubblegum lip scrub and it's basically
just a lip exfoliant and Emily's look in
Emily's looking a little better than um
Sarah I think it was yep not as good as
Coke EEB though you know she has some
nice hair going on
lush lip scrub yeah so this stuff smells
freaking amazing smells exactly like a
lollipop and like bazooka gum mix don't
know if I'm gonna be able to like not
eat this oh my god I smells so bad my
mouth
watering out okay that's bad I think
this was 895 there's no little sticker
thing but this was also recommended by
you guys so dabs
so yeah that was everything I got at
lush my bag is now empty yeah oh yeah
maybe I should tell you what lush is if
you've been living under a rock he says
that they make effective products from
fresh organic fruits and vegetables the
essential oils and safe synthetics it
doesn't sound all natural to me
synthetics basically they make like
organic vegan natural that's good
really like the atmosphere of lush
however the sales people need to tone it
down a notch in my book what else do
they want to say about lush I don't know
what did you want to say why do I always
turn British when I film this video is
going to be so all over the place but I
figured a video is better than no video
right since this is kind of a vlog we'll
just keep talking
I get asked 500 billion times what red
dye I use I normally use the L'Oreal hi
color in magenta from Sally Beauty if
there's not a Sally beauty by me excited
I would just get like the $6 whatever it
is splat color from Walmart and try that
just in raspberry which is really weird
it smells kind of like raspberries in
peroxide but I like the way the color
turned out however it is 50 times more
messy than normal hair color it
literally looks like the Little Mermaid
got murdered in my shower and then after
I washed it out I look down and my hands
are bright ass red so I had to like
scrub it with exfoliant to like get my
hands a normal shade of skin but they're
still kind of like pink tone but
probably use this color again just for
the convenience factor is cheaper and
it's just it was easier since I just
colored it I don't know how long it
stays in or anything like that I'm
guessing it a wash out faster than the
Sally Beauty stuff I think we're gonna
wrap up this haul vlog whatever it is go
watch the study abroad videos you can
find out all the details about where I
am what I'm doing why I'm not making
videos as regularly as usual you can
always talk to me still on
Instagram whatever thumbs up if you like
this and I'll see you guys in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
