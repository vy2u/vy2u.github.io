hard right now just gonna kind of be
there we go
all right so today we're gonna be doing
a little permanent brow update because
I've had these babies on for two years
now I tweeted asking if you guys wanted
to see an update and legitimately
thought it had only been a year
definitely been two years time literally
flies so we're just gonna do an update
I'm gonna tell you guys if I think it's
still worth it what I've noticed in two
years if there's been any changes in my
brows and just answering your questions
from Twitter so before you watch this
video two years ago I made a video
documenting this whole process that
video goes really in-depth about what I
got done the experience the process I
show actually getting it done explaining
about the technique the price it covers
literally all of the basics so go watch
that video then come back and watch this
one because I'm not gonna be covering
and you have the kind of basic stuff
which was a lot of the questions that
you guys asked on Twitter by the way I'm
wearing very minimal makeup right now
because this is the way that I like to
wear my brows which I'll talk more about
but just so you guys can fully see the
brows without like full-face foundation
on so I just have on attended
moisturizer and lip gloss basically in a
little bit of blush so I live in Seattle
but I actually get my brows done in San
Diego because that's where my family
lives and I found a woman there that I
just love her name is Carrie she's at
fine Lane studios that's who does my
brows you guys will see her in that
first video but I actually show you guys
the first time which was in March 2016
so almost exactly two years ago and then
I also showed what they look like after
the first touch-up in a fifteen days of
foundation video because I happen to be
filming when I was getting my brows
touched up so that was the Golden Rose
stick foundation so I'm gonna leave that
video link down below so you can see the
footage of what it looked like right
after the touch-up so I've been calling
them permanent brows because the method
that Kerry uses is technically not Micro
bleeding she uses a technique that's
supposed to last a little bit longer
fade a little bit less and micro
bleeding and it's called tapping so
that's the method that she does you'll
see a huge difference between that first
video and then the second video where it
was a touch up because the second time
you go in is kind of where you get to
fine-tune the shape more address the
color if you need to and you and the
brow artists are kind of like more on
the same page about what you're going
for and also it just fills everything
and more and just like makes your brows
show up more the second time we do it
because you have to do the touch-up so
after that second time I was in love
with the shape it was exactly what I was
going for the color everything was
perfect and the color does fade about I
think 20 percent within the
first like five to seven days after you
get them done so I always like a lot
darker right after you get them done and
then it fades when you start washing
your face and everything like that to be
the color that they're gonna be so after
that second time I feel like Carrie just
nailed it with the shape that was
exactly what I wanted so I'm gonna start
answering your guys questions in just a
minute but I'm just gonna give a quick
rundown of anything I've noticed in the
past two years so overall I one had not
realized I'd been two years I thought
had only been a year and I was happy
with the results but for having this be
my brows at the two-year point I am just
shocked that they still look this on
Carrie would say most people get a
touch-up between like one in three years
just depending on how your skin is how
it fades because obviously they're gonna
wear differently depending on the
products that you use if you're using
any retinol things like that so I
actually can't get a touch-up anyways
since I'm on accutane right now you
can't get any kind of tattooing or
anything like that so I'm waiting until
after I get off accutane to do it but I
don't really feel like I need it yet
like I'm totally satisfied with them
still which is amazing for having these
on for two years I definitely feel like
the color has faded a little bit but it
hasn't turned green it hasn't turned
blue if it looks like that on camera
it's because I'm an artificial lighting
right now I don't feel like my brows
look green or blue at all if anything I
feel like they look a little bit gray so
that is something that I'm looking
forward to when I get it touched up is
just adding a little bit more of like a
dark brown in there I don't want to go
too dark when I first got them done
because you can always go darker but you
can't necessarily go lighter typically
if I'm just running out the door going
to the gym I won't put anything on
sometimes I'll run some like Ulta brow
gel through just add a little bit more
Brown in there but I mean I think they
look totally great without anything too
so sorry is it fading which a bunch of
you guys asked about if you look really
close there's definitely certain spots
where it can be touched up just like the
shape on the outside and then some of
like the brush strokes and stuff but
they haven't faded nearly as much as I
was expecting one thing that I have
noticed that I really enjoy is that they
almost serve as a guide for my brows so
whether I'm putting on brow products
which I'll talk about with makeup or if
I'm just plucking my eyebrows the shape
is already there and the shape doesn't
move so it's really nice to have a guide
to pluck my brows you guys know I I
really despise brows like I hate doing
my brows that is the one makeup thing
that I do
not enjoy because it's always
frustrating to me it's never an easy
process they never looked the same I
also just really despise plucking my
eyebrows I did it for you guys for this
video so that's just me so having a
guide and somewhere to follow and you
don't really have to think about it when
you're plucking your brows is just
really nice before I started accutane I
had got my brows waxed a couple times
which is really nice just around the
tattoos so they didn't actually wax over
the tattoo because you don't want to do
that if you want your breasts stay on it
just wax where the hairs were growing in
and that's something that after accutane
will definitely still do because again
then I don't do pluck as much in real
life whether it's a family or friend
thinking about getting permanent brows
or to you guys online I always say go
for it if you find the right person
because I am so pleasantly surprised
with not just the results but just how
much easier it has made things in so
many different ways he's on my before
footage of my brows before the first
time I went in I mean my brows pretty
much stopped here there were like way
too big in the front I would have to
fill them in if I just went outside for
two minutes I would fill them in so it's
just really nice not worrying about that
for swimming for the summer doing
anything in the water that's also been
really really nice and because you don't
have to worry about your brows going for
swim in the water if you have a super
busy schedule or your mom or you just
don't enjoy doing your brows like I do
it really does make everything so much
more quick and easy it's also really
nice something I used to always worry
about if you happen to be having a
sleepover somewhere you know when you
wake up in the morning you don't have to
worry about your brows being off your
face they're just on there it's great
one thing that I wanted to note that I
personally do is when I do a full face
to makeup like if I'm putting on a full
on foundation eyes lashes whatever when
I do that I do pencil on my brows
overtop solely because when I put
foundation on since it is ink it's not
actual hair obviously since it is ink if
you put foundation on it can cover up
parts of the brow what you could do and
what a lot of people do very quick and
easily is just take some makeup remover
on a q-tip good thing of the word for a
second and just go over it you could
even like dip an eyebrow brush and
makeup remover and kind of like pencil
that on over it and I would remove any
of the foundation I just feel like
sometimes it looks a little bit off
balance if I have like more
natural brow and then a full face of
makeup so usually I do like to add a
little bit over top it's also a really
fun way to switch up the shapes if I
want to if I get totally sick of the
shape I can just kind of cover up my
brows with Foundation and then just
pencil it on the way I want to if I'm
doing a certain eye look and I want a
really bold brow or if I want a really
natural brow I can kind of just adjust
it that way that's usually why I put on
product in videos over my brows but I
really love the brows for just days like
this this kind of makeup that's just
super basic no makeup makeup basically
so something that I totally talked about
in the first video but I did want to
touch on again is the cost because it
seems like some people compare micro
bleeding or brow tattooing to full-on
tattoos because brow a twos permanent
brows are pretty expensive they can go
anywhere from like 300 bucks which you
know like I said in that video just be
careful with the person you choose
because they are putting something on
your face that everyone's gonna see the
really good brow artists are usually
around 500 and up from what I've seen
and heard of course you can get a big
tattoo on your body for around the same
price but for me I don't even compare to
that because they're just two totally
different things and if you think about
it five hundred dollars for something
that lasts a few years I mean you pay
that if your get eyelash extensions or
something like that you pay that in a
few months so for me it's totally worth
it of course it just depends on your
budget and your lifestyle and everything
but for me I think it's a hundred
percent worth it and I also was in there
for about two to three hours the first
time so also keep that in mind
alright so let's head to Twitter and
answer some questions here kayla says
what would you do differently for your
brows if you were to do it again what do
you wish you knew before you got yours
done I feel like Carrie prepped me
really well for this I think that shape
was the thing I was most concerned about
just because you just have to
communicate really well with the person
that's doing your brows show them
pictures like I talked about in the
first video just be really good about
communicating what you're actually going
for and what shape you do like because
they're on your face you know what would
I do differently I'm glad I went with
this shade the first time because I
really didn't know what to expect with
the shade but for the touch-up I think
I'm gonna go a little bit darker
I don't want warmer necessarily I just
want a little bit like darker richer of
a brown Amy Cohn she says are the lines
still sharp or do they blur fast the
lines is in like the brushstrokes
definitely blur over time the lines are
definitely
more prominent I would say the first
first few months right after you get
them done maybe six months when I pull
down my hair there are definitely
certain areas where you can still see
the strokes it does look like more of
just a filled-in color than it does
right after you get them done right
after you get them done they look like
very prominent strokes you can seen that
15 days of foundation video lizard lady
says do you think you'll end up
regretting it in the future example
you'd be 60 rock and brows from four
years earlier so I feel like that's a
big misconception if your permanent
brows stay on until you're 60 they put
some kind of magic in there because they
actually go away and fade out like I
said as your skin cells turn over so I
think if you weren't getting them
touched up and you didn't want to keep
them the most I think I've read that
they lost is about five years if you
really like just went to someone that
totally messed up your brows and you're
not happy with them and you want them to
fade that happened to me I would
probably be putting on the products that
make it fade faster the retinols and
stuff but also just use foundation and
cover it up and then penciled one so no
if I didn't get them touched up my brows
would definitely be off in a few years
I'm not gonna have permanent brows till
I'm 60
except I might because honestly I love
it Rach says do you ever regret the
shape or thickness that you got no I
honestly I'm so happy with the shape
like I said when I get them touched up
there's one area I think on this browed
that it's just always harder for me to
fill in for some reason I think I want
to add a little bit more to the top on
this one but other than that no I mean I
love the shape mari says I've been
hearing a lot about powder brows have
you considered that instead I've
definitely seen photos on Instagram and
like the videos on Instagram of the
powder brow I'm not sure if it's just
called like powder technique or if
there's an actual name for it but I
would definitely stay away from that
just for what I want a because I really
don't like the look of powdered brows
even like powder brow product I like
seeing more brush strokes so it looks a
little bit more natural that one to me
just looks like too filled in and too
kind of blurry so that's not the look
that I personally like but if you like
that you might like the powder brows
better sunny says how would it work if
you wanted darker brows than your
natural hair color I have naturally very
blonde brows I mean you could obviously
get the tattoo color any color that you
wanted so you could get them tattooed
rker but since you still have hair there
you probably just need to like run a
brow drill through just to cover up your
natural
hair color I have weird eyebrows and my
hair is naturally strawberry blonde so I
have light hair but my eyebrows have
always been really dark I feel like you
could probably make it work
Heather says how do you handle changing
trends some years it's thicker more
natural thin one of the reasons why I
really like my shape is because I feel
like it's not either of those it's not
too thin it's not too thick it's kind of
like right in the middle and if you look
at my before it's actually a lot thinner
than I was
penciling them in before especially like
the front area personally I wouldn't go
for like a trend style brow because that
does always change I would go for
something more neutral and then know
that you can always kind of work with it
from there I love says do you have to
wash your face differently so do you
definitely do right after you get them
done I'm really cautious right after I
get them done with not you know
splashing water and stuff on it and just
with the foundation and taking off my
makeup the brow artist should tell you
about aftercare but now no I just
totally washed my face normally and I
have for the last couple years if you're
using like a chemical exfoliant you
probably wouldn't want to rub that right
over your brows but just rub it on the
rest of your face and then rinse it off
so I think I kind of touched on
everything again I'm super happy with my
brows still and I'm excited to keep them
on and keep bidding I'm touched up and
everything to me is something that is
totally worth the investment even just
for the time I've been able to cut out
of my routine and just how much easier
it's made everything in my personal
experience with who I went with and just
a technique and how they faded and
everything I would definitely recommend
