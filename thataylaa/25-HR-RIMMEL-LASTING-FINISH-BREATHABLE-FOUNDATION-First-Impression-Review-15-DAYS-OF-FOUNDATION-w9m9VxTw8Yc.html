days of foundation this is where I try
out a new foundation every single day
for 15 days I'm gonna have the playoffs
link down below and every single day
where you can go back and watch other
days so right now obviously there's only
day one and the announcement video if
you are just stumbling across this video
and you haven't seen the announcement
video yet definitely go watch that you
don't forget to vote every single day
for your winning shelter in which city
you want there to be a meet-up in so
today's foundation is a new drug store
release this is the Rimmel lasting
finish 25 hour breathable long wear
foundation I don't know what's with
Rimmel in 25 hours they have like 10 25
hour foundations at this point I'm not
sure if they've said that they're
discontinuing this foundation but it
seems like there's some talk about that
that they are and this is kind of like
the new version of it or if they're
keeping both of these if so that's a
bummer because this is actually one of
my favorite drugstore foundations I have
a Hello older view on this foundation
like a few years old but this is one of
my all-time favorite foundations the
reason why I don't reach for this is
because it breaks me out horribly Rimmel
products there's something in them the
stay matte powder this foundation other
foundations I've tried from them there's
some ingredient that tends to give me
intense like cystic breakouts
consistently so I'm hoping that this
foundation doesn't do that for me today
but quick ode to this foundation if you
have not checked it out if you have dry
skin if you have oily skin the
foundation is beautiful across all skin
types has great coverage beautiful
finish lasts amazing throughout the day
would highly recommend you check out
this foundation if you haven't already
well let's move on to this guy so this
foundation has one fluid ounce a product
which is standard and it retails for
about $6.99 to 7:50 around there you
know when you set an alarm and you have
no idea what it was for
looking on Rimmel's website it's not
looking good folks not looking good it
has two stars and 24 reviews this
foundation comes in 16 shades which is
pretty good for the drugstore for a
first launch looking on their website it
says it's a breathable foundation
Rimmel's most lightweight long lasting
formula it perfects your skin with
medium buildable coverage moisturizes
for up to 25 hours with SPF 18 on the
bottle it says SPF 20 it is a glass
bottle and you get a actual wand
applicator in here which was surprising
to me you guys will see so I'm gonna be
swatching for you guys the three light
Chay's which r08 one fare ivory 100
ivory and 101 classic ivory some insert
swatches right here so you can see how
these three lightest shades compared to
some of my other foundations
alright so swatch time this first shade
is the lightest shade of the Rimmel
lasting finish in 0-8 one next over is
the same foundation in 100 and 101 as
you can see there's quite a big jump
between these first two lightest shades
next over is the old lasting finish 25
hour foundation in 0-9 one this is the
lightest shade of this foundation other
favorite drugstore foundations CYO life
proof in 101 derma call to 0-8 my
closest shade match Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless in 110 don't like
this foundation I just included it as a
swatch so you guys can see a comparison
if you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the burrito family
and subscribe I'm uploading every single
day the 15th to the 29th for 15 days
foundation I usually upload Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. sips time
alright so it's 10:40 - I've already
washed moisturize and prepped my skin
for foundation it's actually been a few
days since I filmed a1 I was in
California and while I was there I got a
little sick if I sound a little throaty
that is why I have 3 shades of this
foundation you guys have our DC and
swatches but I haven't done them yet 0 9
1 light ivory was a pretty good shade
match for me as I'm going to try and
pick one that looks closest to that in
the bottle 0 9 1 I think might be a
little bit light which is great if you
have a fair skin toner than I do
I think I'm gonna go with the second
lightest shade which is a hundred ivory
I'm gonna do half my face with a sponge
this is the LA girl sponge it rocks then
we're gonna do the other half with a
brush Sigma f80 let's give this thing a
shake Oh was not expecting that this
thing has a huge Jaffa applicator this
doesn't look like the Clinique one this
is an interesting shape looks like an
eggplant or something I guess we're just
gonna dip in and brush on the face whoo
feels like soft or something I feels
nice I don't know how much let's just
going with that I guess let's start out
with a brush on this side of my face
like I'm forgetting to do something or
say something I haven't filmed a
foundation video in like week
smells odd pretty sheer I use quite a
bit of product and that looks definitely
like light coverage basically just toned
down some of my redness but you can
still
see scarring freckles and things coming
through I think that shade is actually a
little bit dark hard to tell on camera
but yeah it looks about a shade dark I
might switch over to light a shade zero
eight one this one looks like it's gonna
be too light but maybe I'll just mix
these two shades I'm gonna build this up
with the lighter shade says it's
supposed to be buildable medium coverage
no I do not like the smell this doesn't
look like it built up a whole lot to me
I'm gonna take that lighter shade down
my neck this is a light coverage I'm
gonna do the lighter shade on my
forehead I still can't really tell which
shade I'm closer to some reason is
having a harder time blending out on my
forehead right now it looks nice and
smooth down here but on my forehead it's
kind of like clinging I think this shade
is too light the other shade is too dark
so I'm gonna mix them again on the other
side kind of at the same time this
applicator though feels hello nice feels
like you're rubbing I don't even know
what like velvet or something on your
face
for sure
light coverage it's not really covered
in any of this over here I am a mix
between these two shades not looking
great on my forehead it's making my skin
up there look really really dry let's
try and build this up again over here
getting about the same coverage with the
sponge in the brush but I like the
finish of the sponge better with this
one oh it looks so bad on my forehead on
my forehead especially just right here
not looking good it looks okay up here
but it definitely is clinging to certain
drier areas the finish down here with
the sponge looks okay and it also looks
okay on this side as well it is clinging
in certain areas again down here and
that just came off when I touch my face
I wouldn't call this buildable I don't
think I got any more coverage and I
would call this straight-up light
coverage I do have to go somewhere after
this so because it's not covering any of
the scarring and stuff on my neck I'm
just gonna take some concealer just on
my neck area and then right on this it
I'm not gonna cover anything else
because I don't want it to affect the
foundation too much right now I'm
definitely not into this in the
slightest see what the finish feels like
feels like it's setting down I think I
could blend stuff on top of this feels a
tiny bit tacky but nothing nearly as
tacky as this one that this one's like a
gel foundation so you definitely need to
set anywhere that you're gonna be
putting powder on top so it's 1058 I'm
gonna do the rest of my makeup and I'll
be right back it's 1124 we're gonna
called check-in time 11 o'clock that's
about when I finished up my face I don't
really like a single thing about this
one at this point I looked at it I would
not relighting my forehead it just looks
like it's aged me so here's what we've
got going on in natural lighting I'm
gonna do a little zoom
oh look at that forehead time for a
little flash test
I always forget to smile okay redo
there's definitely a flashback probably
because there's SPF 20 in this one or 18
my face definitely looks quite a bit
lighter than my neck in the photo so
wouldn't wear this one for blush it just
doesn't look good it looks decent in
this area not to the point where I would
want to wear it again it doesn't look
that good that's that that's how it's
looking right now this is one of those
makeup days I think I only liked about
one thing I tried on my face today so I
Chi said I wasn't planning on setting
this part of my face at all but I went
in with the essence luminous matte
bronzing powder for lighter skin this is
straight-up orange folks would not
recommend I ended up having to go with
the face powder just in this area to
tone it down and blend it out because it
looked literally orange I liked this
blush this is the bareMinerals Jen nude
in pretty and pink then I went in with a
highlighter from the Hot Topic video the
black heart highlight and it just did
not look good on my skin today so then I
tried to tone that down and fix it with
the EXO Beauty Aurora highlighter and
this kind of saved the day and then for
my eye shadow I tried out this new BH
Cosmetics glam reflection palette here
is what it looks like on the inside you
have some matte some shimmers the
shimmer shades do not like at all they
feel very scratchy and they're not super
pigmented the matte shades are nice
they're really soft and they are
pigmented so I used a few of the matte
shades on my eyes today and then I tried
to put this one just like on the center
before lips I used open decay
stark-naked comfort mat now on top of it
I tried the soap &amp;amp; Glory
spectacular metallic this is in the
shade gold desk it's like this rose gold
metallic kind of shade it looks pretty
shared on top of here and not super
metallic so I'm gonna have to try that
out again so that's where we're at right
now I like this about 0.5 on a scale of
10 right now if they did in fact
discontinue this like some of the
reviews are saying and replaced it with
this major downgrade
okay so right now it's 920 so it's gone
for over ten hours at this point and I
didn't do a full on check-in because I
was out if I did get some butters right
about six hours and I'm glad I got that
because it's actually looking a lot
better right now like under this
lighting then it really does and then it
looked when I was out it just does not
look good on my skin and that's pretty
much exactly what it looks like still
right now some
zoom in this is after ten hours and it
basically looks really dry now like
drier than earlier see if I can really
show you this
it's like rubbed off in certain areas
slush maybe even not because I don't
know if that was covering it in the
first place
it has oxidized about half a shade
throughout the day I noticed when I was
out to and outside of natural lighting
throughout the day so keep that in mind
this one total pass for me I don't
really see one thing that I like about
this even if you like light coverage
this one is a hard pass if you can smash
the other 25-hour foundation before they
possibly discontinue it hopefully they
don't hopefully they keep that one
because that one was bomb that one
compared to this is like no comparison
whatsoever so pick that one up if you
haven't already hopefully it doesn't
break you out like it breaks me out it's
only 9 o'clock but I feel like it's like
1:00 a.m. right now in the hello tired I
can't wait to wash my face right now if
you guys enjoyed this video and you're
excited for day 3 don't forget to give
this a thumbs up I love you guys thanks
