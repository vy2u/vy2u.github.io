of the world at night this is what I
picture them doing so I'm about to test
out a $400 face mask who decides that a
$400 face mask is something that people
are going to buy people didn't buy it
which is why it's on every discounted
site right now I got my enough of hot
look for 19 dollars you can also get it
on Groupon so it is the end of the night
right now hence why I look like this I
got back from work it's now 8:20 p.m.
and I'm going to take off all my makeup
and put this thing on and this is going
to be like a first impression situation
on this bad boy being $400 I have some
pretty high expectations I'm going to
read some of the claims on here so it
says it's a gentle but highly effective
24 karat gold mask instantly fills lines
and lifts the skin lifts firms and anti
wrinkles helps whiten the skin and
reduce melanin so has water vegetable
glycerin aloe leaf extract marine
collagen some hyaluronic acid which is
really good for anti-aging and then a
bunch of things that our random
chemicals that I don't know what they
are so like I said I got mine off of
haul buck for $19 I'll leave a link for
holic down below bits basically like a
flash sale site where you can get crazy
expensive things for ridiculously cheap
my face looks oily right now so I'm
excited to take off this makeup but
let's do this okay makeup is clearly off
I use the micellar water to cleanse my
face and take off all my makeup so
there's two different there's an eye
section and on the bottom of the face
section there's a lot of liquid in here
so hoping this doesn't like spill over
since you're not supposed to cleanse
your face afterwards so that's
interesting okay so I'm just taking this
out of the foil I have to use these kind
of maps before but number four hundred
dollar one minor like five dollars from
eBay probably have toxic ingredients
okay
smells very fresh you separate this I
really feel like I'm playing with jello
right now exciting this is a tell us why
me where my bowls I'm just using the

woohoo feels nice and very liquidy whoa
it feels really cooling feels like
liquid is like corn down the side of my
face cottony scent I'm literally putting
gold on my face right and just pour that
out all over my bangs there goes twenty
dollars when I envision the Kim
Kardashian's of the world at night this
is what I picture them doing putting
$400 face masks on actually let's be
real Kanye's probably one
this folia look at ha so I'm just trying
to get this to stay on my skin as much
as possible to be like not staying down
in certain parts it is 8:32 so I'm going
to leave this on for 15 or 20 minutes
and report back it's now 853 and I just
took off the mask I didn't wash my face
um but to be honest I probably will
because I'm super sensitive clearly acne
prone skin as far as first impressions
of my face does look very glowy like you
can see under here it has a nice glow to
it and it kind of like took away some of
the dullness the bottom half kept
sliding down my face like I kind of had
to like hold it in place
I definitely like ate it at one point it
tasted like I was eating soap so that
was pleasant when you first put on your
face it is super watery it feels like
it's dripping down and when you take it
off there's nothing dripping so
definitely like fully sank into my skin
I really liked how super cooling the
whole time I feel like if you just lay
down and like put on some music light a
candle and chill it would be like super
relaxing because it does have a kind of
cooling almost tingling sensation did
you think I've messed that are about ten
dollars instead of 400 that'd make my
skin look the same way for one mask
being $400 that is just absolutely
ridiculous to me I can't even wrap my
head around that that is like a month's
rent if you live not in Seattle let me
know how much you guys pay for rent is
that too personal seriously that's like
a car payment right there I even feel
like I don't know if I would pay $20 for
this face mask like in my my 19 dollars
for one single use is really freaking
expensive I feel like there's other face
masks that you can find that are a lot
more affordable that do just as good of
