this is where I try out a new foundation
every single Friday on my channel every
Friday I have a whole playlist that has
all the foundation Fridays in there if
you want to go back and watch any but
today we're trying out a brand new
drugstore foundation by covergirl this
is the covergirl trublend
Matt made foundation so actually I'm
gonna be swatching for you guys the four
four shades three of the lightest and
then the shade m15 but we'll get there I
sent all 40 shades and PRS I'm obviously
gonna be donating the other shades that
don't work for me and then we're trying
out these ones looking on CoverGirl's
website this is supposed to be pore
minimizing oil controlling
transfer-resistant 12-hour comfort mat a
matte formula that isn't drying or cakey
it's drawing it flexible film ooh I
don't know if I would want to describe a
foundation as a film on skin for a
durability and comfort while mattifying
powders absorb oil and minimize pores
for a soft focus flawless finish so I
have dry skin we'll get into that in the
demo part of this video but obviously
this is made for someone that has more
oily skin it's supposed to be an oil
controlling foundation still want to try
it out regardless cuz it is a new
foundation launch and just see how it
works on dry skin foundation has 1 fluid
ounce product in it and you can get it
for about 850 or 9 bucks around there
depending on where you get it forty
shades that is huge for the drugstore
for any foundation forty shades that's a
big step in the right direction I'm
going to be talking about obviously the
lightest few shades you guys will see
how they compared to some of the other
foundations in the past covergirl
foundations for me have always been way
too dark like the lightest shade is
typically about in NC 2530 in covergirl
foundations and they also oxidize some
of my favorite foundations are cover
girl - girl vitalist covergirl matte BB
which I just mentioned in the oily skin
video but I've always had to mix
covergirl because they never have fair
shades like even remotely in the fair
range so the fact that they came out
with 40 shades I know they have deeper
ones - is huge I'm curious to see what
they're gonna carry in stores so I'm
gonna start swatches right here so you
can see how these four shades compared
to some my other foundations
alright so swatches I have four shades
of the covergirl foundation here next to
five other shades just so you can
do some comparisons so this first one
right here is the covergirl trublend
Matt made foundation in the lightest
shade l10 this one is definitely more
yellow than all the swatches right here
so if you have a yellow undertone l10 is
probably the way to go next over is L 15
L 20 and M 15 and M 15 I do feel like
has already darkened quite a bit here's
der McCall 2:08 flower beauty light
illusion in L one CYO life proof in 101
Maybelline fit me in 115 ivory and NARS
natural radiant foundation of Mont Blanc
I did want to swatch some covergirl
foundations and some other drugstore
ones but I actually just packed up like
99% of my makeup collection last night
because I'm moving so they're all in
cardboard boxes right now so
unfortunately I couldn't do that but
hopefully this gives you some shade
comparisons right here so from these L
20 actually seems to be the lightest and
it seems pretty close in undertone to
two of my go to someone called 2:08 and
CYO life proven 101 so I am gonna go in
with L 20 right here so even though it's
technically the third over shade this
one in my opinion looks lighter
obviously the undertones are just
different but it also looks a little bit
lighter so if you're excited for
foundation Friday don't forget to give
this video a thumbs up if you're new
here you can join the burrito family and
subscribe I upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday is 6 p.m. Pacific time
let me know down below what foundations
you guys want to see next I was thinking
about doing the Beauty bakery foundation
and then I'm gonna try and get my hands
on the new Revlon one I have not been
able to find it in Seattle yet but I do
want to do the new Revlon foundation as
well by the way I was up till like 2:00
a.m. packing last night because I'm
moving and trying to pre film and trying
to do basically 5000 things at the same
time right now so if I'm not super
energetic throughout this video that's
why what we're here we're making to
happen all right so my skin is still
more on the normal to dry side so I did
prep my skin really well with my usual
Too Faced three in one setting spray and
a moisturizer so everything I use is
down below to prep my skin but
especially if I'm gonna be using a
foundation like this that's supposed to
be kind of oil controlling which kind of
scares me because I don't have a whole
lot of oils to control at this point I
just want to make sure I'm starting out
with a super moisturized base and the
foundation doesn't like cling to it
hoping this one is wearable for dry skin
but at the same time it doesn't sound
like it's targeted for dry skin
whatsoever so just keep that in mind so
I'm really glad I did the swatches for
this one first because I am going to go
with l20 since that looks like it's the
fairest one and it looks like it has a
super neutral a little bit of like gray
undertone which that's what the UC 101
is and that matches me really well if
you're a pink peach I would go with L 15
and then yellow L 10 so I'm gonna give
this a shake
oh crap and wet my sponge okay have damn
sponge by the way right now it's 8:30 1
in the morning Saturday May 26 so I'm
half my face I'm gonna use my Sigma f80
flat top and on the other half my sponge
we start out with a sponge on the side
of my face it doesn't say on here what
kind of coverage it's supposed to be it
doesn't say anywhere that I can see what
kind of coverage is supposed to be
looking like about medium coverage the
shade at looking at my neck looks pretty
good once I have my bronzer and stuff on
I think the shade will be perfect I'm
scared how this is gonna look with the
brush because right now it's looking
pretty dry with a sponge I just touched
my face and I have like a major
indentation there so not immediately
transfer-resistant that's for sure
definitely not pore-minimizing not
looking good around here at all it's
already creasing on my upper lip and in
this area right here typically with
foundations like this sponge is the way
to go for dry skin okay from what I can
see in the viewfinder I feel like it's
looking a lot better like a lot better
up close it's just kind of one of those
foundations that's like you can just see
every little thing on my face right now
is just kind of emphasizing it try the
brush it has an interesting scent like
almost a mix of the wet and wild photo
focus but not as strong with play-doh
it's not like as toxic smelling as the
wet and wild photo focus but you
definitely smell like clay the shade is
the one thing that so far I am impressed
by we'll see if it oxidizes but
covergirl foundations I have never in my
life seen one go this fair I don't think
this is like the fairest of the fair
there could probably be about 5 more
shades honestly underneath these shades
this isn't super fair I'm not like the
palest of the pale or any
thing if you are very fair you'd have to
mix in a white mixer but speaking from
cupboard roll their usual ranges this is
definitely a step in the right direction
looks a little bit more textured on the
brush side but barely noticeable it's
almost looking kind of patchy it looks a
little bit lighter in certain parts it
doesn't look that much worse with the
brush looks about the same I definitely
want to use my sponge to just kind of go
over this side though it's not the
easiest to blend out it definitely has
like kind of a stickier feel to it it
doesn't feel super thick but it
definitely doesn't feel like lightweight
I think it looks like it's oxidized
about half a shade so far because this
side to me I don't know how it's looking
on camera does look about half a shade
darker so not major but yet I think yeah
this side didn't oxidize a little bit
okay so hopefully doesn't keep oxidizing
like I said covergirl foundations
usually do I think I got a little bit
better at coverage on this side this
side looks like high medium this one
looks like just medium not like in how
it looks on my forehead so I'm gonna
smooth this out with a sponge I don't
have anything on here right now just to
try and get rid of some of that texture
it's just looking pretty cakey up there
okay it just looks overall a bit cakey
like I definitely at this point would
not reach for this foundation again
would not say it's pore-minimizing
whatsoever and it also doesn't look very
soft focus to me I can kind of see where
they were going with that but then it
just totally emphasizes your texture at
least on my skin one thing I do like is
that it feels like it's setting I
definitely could blend powder products
on top of here without it dragging or
sticking it does feel like it's setting
down to kind of like a powdery finish so
that's great it's supposed to be
transfer resistant I am getting some
transfer right now but maybe it just
needs to kind of set down and dry a
little bit more so I'm gonna give it a
few minutes do the rest of my makeup
right now it's 8:41 so I'll be back in a
few minutes okay so now it's 913 we're
gonna call a check-in time 9 o'clock as
far as the formula does not like how
this looks on my skin just looks very
drying very subtly very Creasy again
this isn't supposed to be for dry skin
so keep that in mind but just as far as
how it's sitting on my skin I wouldn't
wear this again I think it's looking
better on camera so I'm gonna do a shot
and natural lighting all included right
here and then we'll do flashes here we
are
natural lighting in front of the window
right here already getting some creasing
on my upper lip right here
and then I'm a jerk racing over here I
don't feel like it's totally picking it
up how bad it looks around my pores but
yeah they're definitely they're there
and then my forehead just looks very dry
a bit cakey almost looks like it's
separating a bit right here but let's go
do a flash test see how this does oh it
looks pretty good actually looks very
like soft and kind of smoothing - not a
great picture but the actual foundation
looks good it doesn't look like there's
a whole lot of flash back it looks nice
and smoothing I actually feel like this
is one of the better ones in flash I've
done so far okay so in the rest of my
face I'm wearing a lot of joy out all
their new stuff but this is the bronzer
duo which I was so freaking excited to
try because you guys know they're blush
formulas and this this g'way blushes are
one of the best formulas in my opinion
blend out so easily so I was excited to
try out the bronzer duo this is in the
shade medium light to medium duo and it
is on the warmer side so I kind of had
to like tone it down with the face
powder a little bit but it blended out
so easily and I would definitely try
this one again I kind of just mix the
two shades so maybe out just going with
this one and then the blush I used is
the pixie Chloe Morello I went in with
this shade right here I actually tried
out the Anastacio glow kit for the first
time ever don't ask me how I managed to
be on YouTube for like seven years now
six years and I've never tried this I
have not it's never appealed to me to be
honest I just feel like it has always
looked a little bit more glittery and I
just knew it wasn't gonna be my thing
and I was kind of right but I went on
with the shade moonstone right here and
it is one that's gonna emphasize your
texture so I don't totally not like it
but just you know it's not a super
flattering one if you have textured skin
eye shadow I tried out the jouer
essential jet set palette which as soon
as I open this these tones look like
right up my alley I've been way more
into cool tones ladies so I just wanted
with these two shades and then this one
in a little bit this one today but I
really like these they blend it out
easily it was easy to get like a cool
tone nice and smoky look I've definitely
used this again then for lips I use this
NARS liquid lipstick this is in the
shade the Freak with like the name of
that still a little outfit edition added
on a jacket this isn't gonna last very
long so it's like
degrees outside today I'll see you guys
in a few hours for the next check in and
after lighting rights it's now 1:30 in
the afternoon insisted on for four and a
half hours right now so I wouldn't say
it necessarily looks any worse it's just
pretty much the exact same thing as
before just pretty crazy my forehead
might actually look at touch better as
it's kind of like warmed up to my skin
throughout the day like I wouldn't say
my skin looks good by any means in this
foundation but it doesn't seem to have
gotten any worse still very crazy around
here and just like you can definitely
see everything on my face right now
I've just been packing my life away
right now then packing dropping things
off at the thrift store and I'm tired I
feel like I hit a wall but I need to
edit so I'll see you guys in a few hours
at the end of the night I've talked a
lot my team no we're good it's now seven
oh six so it's put on for 10 hours over
10 hours I haven't looked at all between
now in the last check-in I would say it
looks a bit worse like even more crazy
down here but my forehead looks about
the same overall just looks pretty dry
and crazy I mean I feel like what else
can I say at this point but here's close
up definitely looks very dry oh yeah
Creason Creason Creason so it's hard to
say if this would sit on my skin
differently if I do a skin if the crease
situation would be different I doubt it
because just the way that it's sitting
on my skin is not the best but it might
be one that does control oil so I can't
say since I have dry skin but I just
recently did a foundation Friday on my
top foundations for oily skin that were
basically my go-to ones but I had oily
skin for years before going on accutane
if you want to know which ones I
recommend for oily skin you can check
out that video I have foundations that
look a lot better so I just definitely
wouldn't reach for this one but as far
as a shade it doesn't look like it's
majorly oxidized throughout the day so
that's good and I think it's just
exciting that covergirl actually came
out with the shade that matches for the
first time literally ever so yay for new
shades forty shades but I hope you guys
enjoyed this foundation Friday if you
did don't forget to give it a thumbs up
I love you guys thanks for watching see
