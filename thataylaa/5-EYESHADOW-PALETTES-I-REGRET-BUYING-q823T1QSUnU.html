up to my neck
all right so today we're gonna be
talking about five eyes shadow palettes
that I wish you never bought I thought
this would be a good way to kind of
circle back on certain eyeshadow
palettes that IV they're used in shadow
and schmooze videos or just used over
the years and just tell you my thoughts
on them as it stands right now and why I
regret buying them in the first place if
you like this video while you're
watching don't forget to give it a
thumbs up so I know let me know down
below if you want to see other videos
like this like different categories or
also if you want to see my favorite
eyeshadow palettes I might do like a
drugstore and a high-end version if
you're new here you can join the baby
toe family and subscribe I upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific
time ran out of air alright so the first
palette I regret buying is one that came
out a couple has it been a couple years
I think it has I did a review on this
right when it came out it's the urban
decay naked smoky palette and I love the
packaging of this I'm so happy they
changed it to the hard package inks have
the cardboard and everything and felt
because that just gets so messy like the
original Naked palette I just never and
I mean never find myself wanting to
reach for this thing I love cool tones
the Urban Decay Naked 2 palette is
actually one of my most reached for
palettes to this day I get so much use
out of it the mirror fell out looking at
these two side-by-side there are
obviously some differences you get a few
more warm tones kind of golds in the top
Naked 2 palette but if you have the
Naked 2 palette I just don't think you
need to get the naked smoky palette it's
just one of those that sits in my drawer
and I never find myself wanting to got
this I should just stick it on the shelf
for looks cuz it looks so nice I've
mixed thoughts on the naked palettes
they were super super hyped up for years
I think there are better kind of smokey
cool toned palettes out there and
personally I just wouldn't spend the
money on this one again so this next
palette you can probably guess what it
is if you've been online on YouTube
watching any videos in the past year but
this is the Anastacio Beverly Hills
subculture palette I have a whole video
trying this out I'll put it in the eye
over here and down below as well if you
want to go watch that but I made it work
in that video and like I've said in a
race and rejects video that I mentioned
this you can make this work I just don't
want to have to sit down and like pump
myself up to try and make an eyeshadow
palette work you know what I'm saying if
you're gonna spend around 40 bucks in
this 42 bucks
we're gonna spend that much money on an
eyeshadow palette I just feel like it
should be easy to work with you should
want to sit down and play with it
shouldn't be like a chore to use it I
just wish the formula was better on this
I love the Anastacio Modern Renaissance
palette like that is one of my all-time
favorite palettes spoiler alert this one
I just wouldn't recommend if you like
the shades in here there are tons of
blog posts and stuff if you just google
it on dupes for this palette so if you
want a better formula but you like the
shades just get the dupes so this
palette I feel like a lot of people love
and this is the Tarte tartlet palette
and I had really high hopes for this I
was excited to try actually tried it for
the first time in a shadow and schmooze
video I'll link that in the eye too over
here first let me show you the shadows
so here's what the shadows look like I
love the packaging really nice sturdy
packaging a really great mirror on here
and it's just visually appealing to look
at I think like I said I love cool tones
and I feel like I have so many warm
tones at this palette that I've been on
the hunt for a cool tone palette that I
love so when I saw the shades in here I
thought I was gonna love this so the
thing I do not like about this palette
is that it gets so freakin muddy when
you try to blend it out when you first
put down the color it looks like it's
gonna have really great pigment to it as
soon as you start blending it disappears
some of the shades get patchy and they
just all kind of melt together it's the
kind of formula where if you put a dark
shade in your outer V and you go to
blend it somehow that color ends up all
over your eye like in places you don't
want it the only way I like using this
palette is if I'm literally doing a two
color everyday kind of look where I just
put one into the crease and one on the
lid and for that I'll go in with
supermom which is like the cream shade
which I still feel like could be more
opaque it looks really nice until you
blend it out on your eye and I can just
see like my freckles and stuff coming
through and then I'll put force of
nature in the crease if I go in with any
of the dark shades it just looks so
muddy actually did use two of the
palettes on my eyes today that I'm going
to be talking about just so you can kind
of see and so I could get a refresher on
what I didn't like about them so I'm
wearing this palette and the next
palette I'm going to talk about most of
the matte shades on my eyes right now
we're from this palette I just had to
work so much harder to get the kind of
look that I wanted black looks like it's
gonna be so nice and pigmented as soon
as you blend it out and again
just turns into like a gray so I wish I
liked the formula better because I love
the shades in here let me know if you
guys have tried the Tarte toasted
palette because I'm really tempted to
get that but every time I'm on Sephora I
end up just deleting it out of my cart
because memories of this flash into my
head by the way a Tarte palette I do
really like is the clay play palette
this was on sale for 20 bucks the other
day on their website and I think Sephora
also had it as one of their weekly Wow
things I don't have the same issues with
this palette as I do with the Tarte lip
palette so if there's something a little
different with the formulas or what but
this one is really nice so number four
again love the packaging on this one
really want to love this one this is the
BH Cosmetics marble collection warm
stone palette not gonna lie I got this
mostly for the packaging so many of you
guys message me when this came out have
a slight marble obsession it's gotten a
lot better in the past few months I have
to say I'm starting to get a little sick
of it for a couple years though it was
it was intense here's what the shades
look like on the inside it bothers me so
much when pellets stop like too soon you
know I thought there was a nice mix of
warm and you get a few cool toned shades
in there this palette out of all of them
is definitely the most affordable so I
don't super-super regret buying this
week it just because of the price BH
Cosmetics makes a few of my favorite
eyeshadow palettes but I find some of
them to be a little bit hit or miss and
this was one of those for me and the
reason for that is because the matte
shades I find to just not be quite as
pigmented as I'd like you have to go
back and kind of dip your brush in
multiple times to really get color
payoff I find with most of the matte
shades and then again the darker shades
just seem to kind of blend away the
shade that I do really like in here is
this light cream shade right here it's
what's on my inner corner besides some
glitter I'll take you guys at the end of
the video it's on my face but I have
some glitter on the lower lash line but
on the inner corner is that champagne
kind of light shade which is super
pretty I feel like that shade would look
really pretty for Bridal makeup the
center of my lid is this kind of topi
gray shimmery shade which is okay I
tried using it wet and dry and I just
didn't get quite the pop that I like I
definitely don't dislike this palette as
much as some of the other palettes I'm
mentioning I just don't find myself
wanting to really use this this one is
just kind of like a wouldn't recommend
that you buy it kind of thing so this
last palette is one that I have had
mixed feelings on over the years I
actually mentioned this
as a favorite in one of my raves and
rejects videos two years ago so there
was a period where I use this and I
liked it at one point all I remember
hearing about on YouTube was this
palette this is the Kat Von D shade +
light eyeshadow palette I don't know you
know those products you have that you
just your opinion changes on them for
whatever reason I don't know if my
preference has changed and eyeshadow
formulas I know I do like a bit more of
a stiff formula now not stiff to where
they don't blend out but just to where
when you put them on your eyes and you
go to blend you still have the pigment
but they don't blend away every time
I've gone to use this in the last year I
feel like I've probably tried to use
this about 10 times and last year every
time I tried to use this I just really
don't like how my eyeshadow turns out I
find it to be too blendable and too
powdery again it just ends up looking
kind of muddy on my eyes similar to the
Tarte one I would say this is even more
powdery than the Tarte one though these
are pretty powdery I know makeup
revolution has basically a dupe of this
palette so I want to order that and see
if the formula is any better because I
do really like the concept of this in
the shades in here I think it's super
versatile shade wise this would be like
the perfect matte palette late last
night I was just sitting here watching
blacklist and I had my lights on and I
was just playing around with some of
these shadows again and I tried four
different times to create a look that I
liked with this and every single one was
just a no it's just too muddy for me I
will say this shade right here is
actually really nice as a face contour
if you have fair skin that's what the
shape looks like blended out so if you
have fair skin and you already own this
palette try using just a dab of the
eyeshadow shade and just blend it out
really well you might like it for that
purpose if I could go back in time I
probably would not buy this those are my
5 eyeshadow regrets let me know what you
think of those eyeshadow palettes down
below just because I don't like em
doesn't mean they're horrible doesn't
mean you won't like them that's the
beauty of the world we are all different
by the way the makeup on the rest of my
face for foundation I mixed the elf
flawless finish Foundation and porcelain
with josie maran vibrancy and RG 5 and
it looks beautiful I really like the
combo of those two first time I'm trying
that combo set it with the cargo
blue-ray powder in 10 and
my bronzer is essence mosaic compact
powder in sunkissed Beauty blush is
actually by H&amp;amp;M this is their canned
elope I think it's called yeah
cantaloupe pure radiance powder blush
then I tried out this new highlight
palette by Sigma this is the chroma glow
and I used peaceful and bedazzle these
two shades right here and kind of mix
them for face highlight glitter around
my eyes is Urban Decay pyro it's like a
white glitter lips this color pop nagi
liquid lipstick with mu a babydoll gloss
I feel like just swallowed like powder
my lashes are the Samantha number 7s by
huda beauty but I hope you guys enjoyed
this video if you do make sure you give
it a thumbs up
love you guys thanks for watching see
you in my next video bye it's my thumb
