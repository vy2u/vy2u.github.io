that you find at every single thrift
store if you've ever been to their store
and this cup hasn't been there there's
something wrong don't trust it alright
so today it is foundation Friday happy
foundation Friday which is where I test
out a new foundation first impression
every single Friday on my channel 6 p.m.
Pacific time today we're trying out a
product from ELF this is their
foundation pallet I have two shades here
at I bought this when I was at like the
prime self-tanner day after kind of
color so I thought I might be the
light/medium but now I'm thinking I'm
going to be fair light because it's been
a few days and I've showered in things
this product retails for 6 bucks you get
0.4 3 ounces of product to give you some
comparison the cosmetics confidence in
the compact which I have a full review
on as well retails for $38 and has 0.6 3
ounces of product they do get a little
bit more in that just as 0.43 the cover
effects total cover creme Foundation
also have a review on that is 42 bucks
and you get at 0.35 ounces of product so
this seems to be in the middle of course
that's assuming that you're going to use
all four shades most people would
probably use one or two shades or like
mix a couple so I'm assuming you
probably use about 0.2 ounces of product
and get this on altas website or on elf
it only comes in three shades fair light
light/medium and medium dark but really
that's pretty much 12 shades since you
get four in each mask
they're not really given this a whole
lot to go off of there's not really any
major claims it just says this creamy
formula glides on effortlessly for
adjustable and natural looking coverage
you'll be free and vegan and that's
pretty much all it says it is silicone
based so to prime my face I use the
number seven airbrush away primer I've
been really liking this so let's put
this on my face I see what the fair
light palette looks like to start all
inside swatches right here of both
palettes so eight shades right so here
are all eight shades from those two
palettes first four shades right here
from the fair to light palette and then
the net local wrong way and the next
door from the light/medium palette i bet
i swatch these is top row left to right
bottom row left to right
barefaced intro today like I said I'm
gonna be switching it up for those of
you who like this better
oh these more neutral shades are kind of
speaking to me this lightest line this
palette looks pretty yellow toned I
haven't watched any of these yet but I
don't think any of these would match me
when I don't have Tanner on I really
like cream contours but you could
probably use these those contours too so
with cream foundations I usually like to
use either my elf brush or my Sigma f80
- both of these are kind of dense and
compact so that is great for cream
products I'm going to do my usual half
base with a brush half face with the
sponge just we can see no idea what
shade I'm going to be today I'm going to
start out with this one and try it I'm
going to go ahead and get my brush in
what time is it right now right now it's
8:40 in the morning I changed my
background so you guys can actually see
the time and now we are matching the pop
socket it doesn't feel very creamy like
it almost feels like a powder putting it
on yeah and it's not sticky or anything
I'm really digging my brush in here
though this is a little concerning
because I already see a major dip here's
to know how many applications you shade
what gives because I feel like I'm
already using a lot
what's a brush seems to be about high
medium coverage so I'm going to try a
sponge on the other side okay so like
nothing is coming off the sponge try and
put some on my finger and then blend it
out with a sponge if you want very light
very natural coverage maybe a sponge is
better but for me I'm definitely getting
way better coverage with the brush kind
of a try my Sigma brush I try the f80 -
this one is a little bit more dense okay
it has right now kind of a soft matte
finish looks really nice and natural on
the skin I do have to like dip back into
product every two seconds all right I
don't think it looks bad it looks a bit
textured in certain areas and not loving
how it looks on my forehead especially
where I have more acne right here just
clinging a bit onto my acne but just
looks kind of natural soft matte don't
hate it but I wouldn't say it looks
really good right now
adding a tiny bit more down here just to
see if it will totally cover my acne
still getting about the same coverage it
doesn't feel quite as creamy as I
thought it was going to it feels almost
more like a powder when you put it on
which is bizarre because it
is a full-on cream when you blend it out
yet it like instantly turns in to a
powder almost good side to that is that
it doesn't really feel like it's going
to move it sets down like I could easily
blend product on top of this I think it
doesn't feel super sticky or anything so
don't know if I want to set my whole
face with this one I almost do want to
just because it's not looked in a
super-great right now and I do have to
go run air today for California tomorrow
morning for 10 days right now it's 8:50
I'm going to do the rest my makeup
decide if I want to put a powder on at
all and I'll be right back alright so
it's now 9:00 15,000 we're calling every
day 915 sets when we're calling the
check-in time ended up setting my face
with a cosmetic celebration foundation
illumination in the shade fair this is
when my favorite go-to setting powders
it does give you kind of glowy dewy
finish and I find that when foundation
is looking really dry on my skin are
kind of patchy and weird
this powder usually helps a lot and it
definitely did with this foundation it
looks really nice now with that powder
on top of it also set my face like
normal Urban Decay all nighter but now
it's that powder on everything is
looking very smooth it looks good on my
forehead I just took a look in natural
light and it looks really good in
natural lighting so I'm going to include
that clip right here so here's what it
looks like in natural lighting right
after I just applied my makeup at a
cosmetic spatter on now in a setting
spray it looks really pretty it looks
really smooth it definitely looks more
doing now that cosmetic spatter is
illuminating for my textured skin this
looks pretty damn good right now still
looks a tiny tiny bit dry and heavy
around certain areas like on my nose but
overall with that powder on now it looks
50 times better than without it so
makeup on the rest of my face everything
is always listed down below in the
description box and the jewelry
everything you want to know it's always
down below so I use a master bronze
palette I tried this in a recent first
impressions video and I really like it
I used that shade and also that's what
my highlight is today or blush a is the
Seurat what actually is this shade this
is the most cheapy packaging ever for
the priceless thing I rose a dis or dis
or this is what it looks like I actually
got this because I thought it was going
to be a good contour shade but on the
face it actually looks a lot more kind
of like a blush with my eye shadow is a
makeup revolution Naked chocolate
palette this is what it looks like it's
kind of supposed to be like a Too Faced
you know makeup revolution has some
really good eye shadows I'm trying out
the L'Oreal voluminous Lashkar dice
which is supposed to be the Too Faced
better than sex dupe I'm sure you guys
have asked me about this I'm going to
give you my quick thoughts
this guy is my holy grail mascara I've
used this for years I love it this to me
is nothing like it
does not give me the same kind of volume
it's much more of a dry formula I think
the packaging is the only thing that's
really similar as far as the actual
formula I still prefer the Too Faced
better than sex
by far lips I use Mac retro matte liquid
lipstick in burnt spice and then I
layered it with wet and wild nudie
patooties thing does everything I need
to pack I need to edit and hopefully go
get my nails done five-time my second
idea will be natural lighting I did buy
a new vlog camera so it's rather one
broke so we will have good quality for
the check ins looking you guys in a few
hours okay so it's now at 2:40 in the
afternoon so it's been on for over five
hours let me grab my mirror in this
lighting it looks like it hasn't
oxidized and it's the right shade but
when I looked outside like by my car and
then also in the filming room it looks
like it was like two shades too dark so
I mean I guess it does here a little bit
too I do think it's oxidized a tiny bit
but right now it still looks really good
thing I like is that I feel like it
almost smoothed out my skin here is up
close at five hours definitely look a
little bit shiny I want to say I'm Boily
yet but around my nose you can kind of
see it starting in on my forehead
placing a little bit around my nose in
my upper lip right there you know
overall with the powder on I'm liking it
I'll check back in with you guys at the
end of the night okay so it's now 9:00
10:00 p.m. so sunny is gone for 12 hours
I'm tired I need to finish packing with
outside in 70 degree weather for like an
hour and a half so I did wear it through
some heat heat breath there's still a
little bit of light out right now so I'm
just in front of the window I think it
looks a little blue but because we're
going to get right now so looking at my
base room far away actually still looks
really smooth but when you get up close
it's definitely breaking down it doesn't
look the best
such on my forehead but it's been on for
12 hours they usually do like 10 hour
check-ins so it has been on for a while
but I think you can actually see this
pretty well so it's breaking down quite
a bit on my forehead actually you can
just see it
all over here also around my nose it
looks a bit oily my chin doesn't look
too bad
for 12 hours it definitely doesn't look
horrible it's still like wearable so
this one I think I'm gonna have to keep
playing around with because I do like
how it looks with this powder now the
powder I was not feeling it so because
totally has been that Cosmetics powder
that saves a day but I'll try it with
different powders and see what I think I
was feeling it was a cosmetics one
because like I said that one does
wonders for foundations that just look
kind of like dry and crepey foundation
on its own right now my impressions are
that it wasn't bad but it wasn't like a
stand out product or anything I do think
it looked on its own a little bit on the
dry side so if you're dry I probably
would recommend this one hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did make sure
to give it a thumbs up I love you guys
thanks for watching see my next video
