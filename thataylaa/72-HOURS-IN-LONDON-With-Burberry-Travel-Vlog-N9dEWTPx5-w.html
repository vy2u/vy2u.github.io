into today let me show you guys what I
got yesterday on Oxford Street if you're
not familiar with London Oxford Street
we can showcase over here is it's a main
like shopping street super drug I went a
little ham actually found the way more
stuff there than at Boots and I only got
two things at Primark not feeling up to
really digging through stuff and like
fighting people basically it was like
forever 21 on crack I'm just doing this
whole thing in the bathroom because
marble
how to utilize it this is actually a
sports bra that is super cool has like
this snakeskin print and then black and
then I got this mug because I guys know
I'm obsessed with Sunanda Leafs and this
was 2 pounds I don't know if I want to
show you guys everything actually
because I kind of want the whole get
ready with me first impressions video to
be using the products
first time - here's a little sneak peek
I got some stuff from em you a fairy em
look at the ceiling as always here's the
view I think I look into an yeah it's
like an office building over here guys
bar area southern car it's an expresso
machines at 6:00 p.m. and you just
desperately charged my phone we've
basically been out the entire day so
when I got here I checked into this
hotel this morning but the room wasn't
ready and I met up with three of the
other bloggers honest thing they're all
from LA and they were all in the same
flight they also then this morning we
took a taxi there to Camden Market and
there's like tons of vintage II kind of
places it looks like Venice Beach
basically in California suburban there
it's pretty much what it looks like but
with better food and like some really
cute shops and stuff and just staying
there probably for like um you know I
don't think we're there anything an hour
I'm fine what's doing whatever I don't
really care like I just like seeing
places some of the food places did look
really cool but I got some pictures and
stuff we went to Notting Hill after that
Notting Hill was adorable
there were some like major Paris
designers there I guess just really cute
streets and like outside of the stores
then we went to Big Ben walked around
the Big Ben area there was like a trump
protest going on
it's just crazy even across the world
I'm about to order like a ten-course
meal think I'm going to get like steak
and maybe some wine in a salad that
sounds really good right now
I got a Caesar salad prawn fillets the
sauce some champagne cheers guys and
then bread I haven't been doing very
good with little no gluten thing here so
I just showered and wash my hair and
blow-dried it getting ready to slider in
it and I usually curl my hair with the
flat irons both of my flattering options
are totally not working right now
I forgot my you flat iron at home I
can't from very touch about this job
about this back up at super drag it's
the fabulous cordless one this does not
work at all it does not get hot enough
for my hair and it literally did nothing
we're going to have real fun hair for
tomorrow
half a Royal Hotel coming through I
called them like a half hour ago to see
if they had a straightener and they
didn't and then she just called me back
and they have a straightener they
managed to find one thank you so much I
am so excited and I got some tea going
chamomile tea watching Lauren XXL see
how they do this
this is so bizarre so it must be my
adapter converter because out here my
flat iron works fine I have it plugged
into the converter that they gave me but
there's not that outlet in the bathroom
so I have to do it out here so I'm using
this time as mere two attempts to curl
my hair right now there is successfully
then all I do is curl it at night with
my Bombay straightener and I get this
kind of curl just a little bit of hair
stir with it and then in the morning
it's kind of like falling out of it it
is everyday it's 7:30 in the morning we
have a cappuccino some hash browns and
bacon fruit breads and then some orange
juice I woke up feeling not so great
today I just took to the pill but my
neck is just really bad right now call
and see if they can help me keep this
thing up alright so the pillow kicked in
thank God feeling better now I ate and
showered got ready clearly so much oh
you guys my outfit and also what makeup
I'm wearing actually really crap
lighting over here for the interesting
so my leather jacket is from TJ Maxx and
it's like this light purple gray color

dress it has like a collar and stuff and
this is from forever 21
these boots are Sam Edelman I love the
youth it looks kind of chilly out where
is this blue so makeups on my face is
the pur cosmetics bear doll foundation
it's just flips is Too Faced melted
matte and cool girl so my eyes was the
Urban Decay Naked Ultima basics palette
I love this thing this pellet rocks use
this for all the matches and then I only
used one shade out of the Modern
Renaissance color there is the only
color that I have on my list think
that's it I didn't want to put on false
lashes because my eyes just freak out
with lash glue
I'd be like pulling them off in an hour
anyways this was the blush I use
highlights my favorite position for my
natural nude contour self I broke it in
a light shade Physicians Formula I
booster eyeliner I'm going to bring you
guys along we're meeting down in the
lobby at 10 a.m. it's like 9:50 right

the room a little bit ago it's like 6
o'clock now I need to get out of these

take my makeup off but I'm pretty sure
of going back out right now I just
ordered some food to the room because we
never really had lunch you had tea and a
few little sandwiches that like three
o'clock but I'm still hungry so I got a
pizza so today was amazing is just crazy
being surrounded by like Fashion Week
stuff I sing the whole collection was
super surreal to me because Kylie
general is freaking wearing one of those
pieces today like it's just unreal and
the Masterclass was super fun our makeup
artist was amazing she was just like a
really interesting woman and recited to
play around with the makeup they give us
a whole that oh it should open they gave
us a little bag gift thing to open so
here's the bag full of makeup I don't
know how I'm gonna fit all this in my
suitcase there's a bag filled with all
the stuff that was on that counter and
then they give us this little goodie bag
which I totally forgot about so let's
open this today was really fun I feel
like I was vlogging so much that it was
hard to like live in the moment I just
want to like sit down and think and
process everything a really cool meeting
some different people there's a lot of
people from China and Singapore and
Thailand and then Melissa Alyssa Flores

super sweet and just genuine if you
folks on the wrong planet or something
because everyone else slinging tomorrow
but hers love today so wish we had more
time to chill but I'm just starving
right now I cannot think without food I
was about to like pass out at one point
my blood sugar is so low from not eating
all day so let's open this thing all of
their bags are just so beautiful no
okay so it's in this simple thing if
these are liquid lipsticks
I'm good and I think they are oh and
there's a notebook
come on and write about the trip in here
and then just keep that red on red heck
yeah oh this cute little pencils in here
so if you want to pause here's a little
card about them I haven't worn them for
a full day yet or anything so I'm not
sure how they wear I leave tomorrow
it feels weird like this past day I feel
like was really long before that it
would be really quick but it's just so
much to do here like I feel like I could
stay here for a couple weeks I'm very
proud of myself because I'm rallying and
