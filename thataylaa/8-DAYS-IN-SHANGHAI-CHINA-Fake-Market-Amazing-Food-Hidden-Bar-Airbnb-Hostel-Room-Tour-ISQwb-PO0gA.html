gonna leave this time-lapse going on I
feel like they've got a good one
the represent I've been here we've been
on that side as a lotteries you to take
like an underwater bridge menacing
so I think I'm just going to chill in
the back turn out the lights look at the
view and have a relaxing night so I'll
talk to you guys tomorrow is the next
morning I have about four examine -
let's check out the Airbnb so I'm going
to grab some breakfast and then this
elevator going down 31 floors right now
I want you to get ready with moving out
on the patio with like the view in the
background but it's pouring rain right
now so that didn't happen
put on some makeup gotta go get food s
really need coffee - I got a sweet
yogurt you want - I think this is just
expressive I wanted to find one without
like the milk and sugar stuff I think
most was that is I'm going to make some
hot water and then it's just a fun thing
these are so good I really know what's
in this I asked for vegetables and I'm
pretty sure it needs that biscuit
definitely meat send out my bun ringing
today this is so smart
I just realized under here they have
little pulled up spooning and for all of
that it was the equivalent of two
dollars and sixty cents alright so I
finally made it to our best friend's
house I'm like limping right now so
major
pins and needles but my taxi driver
dropped me off in the total wrong alley
and if you guys saw these streets I mean
I'm going to try and show you outside
right now I don't know where you go and
you literally just have to wander around
until something looks at my familiar so
these are the streets that I was trying
to figure out where it was going
it's like a whole Center in here there's
all these little streets going through I
finally found the actual right building
food mosquito under a building got in
the building and then it could not get
the door I'm watched for literally 20
minutes I was like texting our bird
trying to see how he did it one of those
super weird blocks I finally got in 20
minutes later almost peed in my pants in
the hallway but now we are here I'm
gonna give you guys a room tour
hopefully our first friend doesn't mind
me putting her apartment on the internet
whenever I travel I always think it's
really interesting seeing where people
live and just how the apartments are
different stuff I'm gonna give you guys
a quick apartment tour I'm not going to
show any of our best friends like
personal stuff because she does live
here so this is the front door that you
walk in through that I can knock it open
so here's the kitchen everyone has a hot
water kettle here - boiled water if you
can't drink it or you just buy actual
water bottles not through here here's
the bathroom something here again
tonight I'm gonna shower
that man he lost her here this is a big
apartment our birthing and then here's
like a little living room area right
here
frigerator when you walk through here
and here's the bedroom here's her bed I
love all the natural light coming in
right here most places have this little
it's called Sun area Sun Room as a
washer and then for drying your clothes
you just open these doors and then these
are little bamboo shoots and you pull in
the bamboo shoots and then hang the
clothes up and like slide them back out
some of the neighbors have not right now
but they all have some food so I don't
think our r is going to sleep here
tonight I'm not sure actually but I
leave for Taiwan in the morning I was in
a class until 3:00 today
it's 2 o'clock now I literally left the
other place that told us how long it
took me to find this and get in I think
I'm going to find this place called
grace story I found on Instagram it
looks really cute I have like places
that I screen chatted before I actually
got here since I haven't been able to
get on Instagram or social media or
anything okay so I made it to grace
cafes is officially the cutest place
ever I have this room to myself right
now but check out this decor this is
like a tastes kinda like hot chocolate I
think so cute and I just got tuna
sandwich salad and some water
so I literally got locked out for a half
hour and Arbor had to come and now he
can't get it either
