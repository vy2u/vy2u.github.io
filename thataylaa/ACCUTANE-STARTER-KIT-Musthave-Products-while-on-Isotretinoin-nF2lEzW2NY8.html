talking about the products that helps me
survive accutane if you are new here I
just got off accutane a couple months
ago I was on a six-month course I
documented the entire thing I have a
whole accutane playlist that goes
through everything progress side effects
all of that I have a video talking about
my dry skin skincare routine while I was
on accutane but I thought it'd be
helpful to just have everything in one
place between some makeup products skin
prep skin care random things that if I
was going on accutane again I was doing
research hopefully this video will be
helpful hopefully some of these help you
have a smooth sailing accutane
experience I actually still use all
these except one thing to this day so
these are products that really work for
my skin accutane disclaimer like I have
to say in every I fifteen video I'm not
promoting accutane I'm not saying that
everyone should go on accutane it's a
super serious drug has some really
intense side effects these are just
products that I personally found works
great while I was on accutane
if you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the baby toe
family and subscribe I upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. 6 times
so if you're not aware one of the main
side effects of accutane is dry skin you
can get intense peeling raw extremely
dry skin bleeding lips everything just
dries out from accutane so all these
products pretty much are geared towards
that so one of my biggest tips I have
for you is start this routine or start
using some of these products a couple
weeks before you actually start accutane
I think that's what helped me a lot
especially my lips oh speaking of lips
by the way I tried out a bunch of
different products throughout this whole
thing and these are the ones I really
nailed down that actually works for me
which is why they're in this video so my
number one Holy Grail lip product well
on accutane
I still use this every single night is
the aqua for healing ointment advanced
therapy don't get the little tube like
squeezy one made for your lips get this
tube this one right here the healing
ointment advanced therapy this is
amazing for super super dry lips it's
basically just like a Vaseline kind of
consistency so you just rub it on gives
you that glossy look I would apply this
multiple times throughout the day just
as soon as my lips started feeling dry
again I
kote this on at night like i said i
still use this to this day at night it's
also really great if you just have like
really cracked elbows or something and
put this on your skin as well and it
doesn't leave you like a super greasy
kind of film on your skin if you use it
there get one of these for your purse
get one for your card going for your
house because you'll be using this 50
billion times later in accutane let's
start out with nighttime like what I
would use at nighttime and then go into
morning and then skin prep and then
makeup a lot of these skincare things I
did mention in my skincare routine video
like I said just want to have everything
in this one place so this is what I
would use to remove my makeup still use
this every single night this is the
fresh Seabury cleansing oil this doesn't
irritate my skin doesn't cause me to
break out it removes everything so you
could remove liquid lipstick with this
eye makeup waterproof mascara this takes
off all my makeup and it leaves your
skin with that really pretty glow but
not to where it's too tight and dry I
find that a lot of cleansing oils either
leave that gross residue on your skin or
it makes it like too tight so this is a
good way to remove your makeup makeup
wipes on accutane I still use my
Neutrogena wipes as well but if you are
someone who has a really sensitive skin
to the touch when you're in accutane
like a lot of people get we're actually
like hurts to touch your face then
something like cleansing oil could be
better than like using a white that kind
of tugs at your skin so this is like one
of my holy all these products are my
holy grail but this is really ultra holy
grail right here this is my face wash
that I use it morning and night still to
this day this is the survey hydrating
facial cleanser it has this kind of
milky consistency to it where it
moisturizes your skin but it doesn't
leave a gross residue on there makes
your skin feel just so soft and
moisturized without being oily I'm
almost done with this bottle so this
thing lasted me the entire course of six
months and more it's now been around
eight months get this for washing your
face so I would use that after the
cleansing oil when you're in accutane
typically you want to keep your skincare
super basic you don't want to be putting
any kind of lactic acids on BHA is AJ's
nothing you just basically want to keep
your skin moisturize and use gentle
ingredients so this is definitely one of
my Holy Grail skin care products still
use this every single night I swear by
this for acne scarring as well this is
the ordinary rosehip oil this one is a
hundred percent cold pressed oil
so I haven't tried other brands of
rosehip oil I know this one's always
sold out this is super affordable it is
amazing I can't tell you how much this
has done for my skin I can go back and
see when I started using this throw
accutane but I want to say it was about
halfway through and it just kept my skin
so moisturized gives you that glow even
now I notice a huge difference if I skip
a night with this my skin is so much
less plump and more dry amazeballs so
the night cream I would use is the
survey skin renewing night cream this is
the one I recommend they have bunch of
different creams by survey night creams
but this one with the purple lid and the
little tub is the one that I recommend
went through an entire one of these and
I'm about halfway through this one since
being off accutane I haven't been using
this as much just because I felt like I
haven't really needed to between other
things I'm using on my skin now and the
Rose have oil I just haven't been
reaching for this but if I feel like my
skin is super dry I will go back in with
this also I should mention I have never
been able to find a facial oil before
this that hasn't broken me out almost
every facial oil breaks me out I get
closed comedones I like the little tiny
white under the skin kind of bumps I've
tried the drunk elephant marilla oil
I've tried the fresh Seabury oil I've
tried a bunch of different facial oils
and 99% of time my skin does not like
them at all so this is a rare run and
also face moisturizers can really break
me out as well so all of these products
in here obviously don't break me out it
is pretty hard for me to find face
products that don't break me out it's
not to say that these won't break you
out because everyone's skin is different
when I was on accutane I didn't want
like a thinner gel pen and moisturizer I
wanted to really layer on the moisture
and keep my skin moisturized throughout
the night which is why I went for this
one it's like a thicker kind of
consistency I mean it's in a tub but
this in combination with the oil was
perfect
so eczema is another side effect of
accutane I never had eczema before going
on accutane now that I've been off it I
don't have eczema at all so it was only
while I was on it I didn't really want
to go on a steroid cream or anything
that was prescribed by the dermatologist
I felt like I could just find something
that worked through you guys without
having to use a steroid cream so I can
really thin out your skin tons of you
guys recommended this and I wish I
discovered this sooner because this is
incredible for dry skin and eczema this
is the first day beauty ultra Repair
Cream intense hydration hate the smell
this I talked about this in a recent
raisin rejects video the smell to me
smells so bad but this works this is
like a game-changer for eczema it really
took my eczema down a few notches I
tried a few different body butters and
creams and stuff for eczema I tried the
lock seat on body butter shea butter one
which was like $60 or something and that
made my skin burn and maybe my eczema
totally flare up this is super gentle
there's no fragrance in it it actually
says on here that it's for eczema it
says you can use it on your face I
haven't tried it on my face mostly
because the scent would like make me
want to vomit but if you need a balm
body moisturizer and you're having
eczema side effects then seriously check
this out it's worth every penny alright
so moving on to the morning time makeup
prep so in the morning I would start out
with this use that same cleanser then I
would go in with an SPF you definitely
want to wear an SPF every single day
when you're on accutane because you can
turn into a tomato and get fried it
makes your skin super sensitive to the
Sun so even if you're just out for five
minutes put on sunscreen learned that
the hard way so this one I really like
and I mentioned this in other accutane
videos but since then I've discovered an
SPF that I love this one is the elta MD
UV shield they make a tinted version I
understand now why it says for oily to
normal skin I wouldn't say this dries
out your skin at all but definitely
gives you more of like a matte kind of
look so if you like that or if you're
not looking to add any kind of glow into
your face then this one could work
better for you but for me personally
this has been amazing I've been using
this every single day for the past
probably two months now it doesn't break
me out it's also hard to find an SPF
that doesn't break me out I almost feel
like this has helped my skin this is the
LA roche-posay Posay I'm saying that
right SPF 60 it says cooling water
lotion sunscreen transforms to water
like lotion weightless and refreshing it
definitely feels much more like a
sunscreen than this one this feels just
more like a moisturizer this one does
have that kind of sunscreen II feel to
it but not to the point where it feels
oily and greasy but it still gives you
that glow it just kind of like melts
into your skin it doesn't feel super
thick and if you have really dry skin
this would probably be a better option
than the elta MD one I've also used this
on my body
it gives you that like really pretty
kind of body glow I'm just big fan of
this you can get this off a derm store
I'm gonna have everything I'm talking
about link down below so since
discovering that sunscreen that's
actually what I've been using most often
as like my moisturizer and SPF I haven't
felt like I needed to layer another
moisturizer but if you feel like you do
then the serum a daily moisturizing
lotion is what I used every morning I
was on accutane ceramides and hyaluronic
acid in it hyaluronic acid is good for
moisture this one is just like good
daily super gentle moisturizer for
underneath makeup I've had a bunch of
you guys messaged me saying you're on
accutane your makeup look shitty because
you just can't get your foundation to
sit good on top of your skin and my
biggest tip is skin prep it doesn't
matter what kind of foundation you're
putting on if you can't get your skin to
like a nice moisturize kind of state
before you're putting on your foundation
it's just not gonna look the best that
it could I did do a whole dry skin
foundation routine so I go really in
depth about what I did but these are
just two products that stand out to me
for prepping your skin the first one is
a two-faced hangover 3 and one this is a
primer spray you can use it underneath
makeup as a setting spray it gives you
really pretty glow I cannot do my makeup
without this thing now still use it
every single day it's silicone free
alcohol-free and oil free I just feel
like this really helps moisturize my
skin and prep my skin for makeup my
makeup does not look nearly as good when
I skip out on this step and then
something that I used on accutane that I
haven't used more recently is the pixie
hydrating milk you miss this one also
has hyaluronic acid in it again this is
just kind of like another layer to add
moisture so if I was using both of these
I would use this and then this but
really if I was just recommending one I
would probably go with this one I'm not
gonna go really in depth about
foundation because I could talk about
that for 5000 years you guys know but I
also have the whole video on it these
are just two that I'm quickly gonna
mention that if you have no idea where
to start for foundation and you just
need one that's dewy and moisturizing
and can work on super dry skin I would
say CYO lifeproof for a drugstore option
and estee lauder double wear a nude not
the double wear get the double or nude
both of these are more around medium
coverage you can build them up if you're
going through a purge base on accutane I
would say still try something like this
so that your overall skin looks good and
then just spot conceal on your acne
using a concealer so that you can cover
it up but it's not looking super heavy
and super cakey but these two just never
failed me with dry skin they just look
plump and nice and they keep my skin
looking good so I talked about the
aquaphor but I wanted to mention this
lip product because I did use this a ton
Wobs on a kitane I still use it's one of
my go-to lip products is the Linea lip
sleeping mask I'm like almost totally
out of this one the thing I like about
this is that this one I would use if I
did have makeup on and I wanted a little
something on my lips like a little bit
of color but if my lips were too dry or
pili for like a liquid lipstick or a
full-on lip product it just gives you a
really pretty light kind of pinky nude
gloss to your lips where it's not gonna
super emphasize the crack enos but add a
little bit of color the Aqua for when
it's completely clear so if you want
something to wear while you're wearing
makeup or during the day then this one
could be a good option I don't find it
to be as moisturizing as aqua for as
almost like a lip repair product I would
definitely recommend the aqua for over
this but this is a good like daytime
option the last two are not makeup or
skincare they're just random things that
I think are helpful to know if you're
going on accutane the first thing
disclaimer it is an herbal supplement
I'm not saying that you should go on
this because I don't know your body I'm
not a doctor I'm not a pharmacist but it
might be helpful to talk to your
dermatologist or ask your pharmacist
about this if it's right for you this is
what I use to lower my cholesterol and
accutane it can also really help with
your liver so accutane can mess up your
liver I got this off of Amazon it's milk
thistle extract I would just take one
pill at lunch a thousand milligrams read
the Amazon reviews for this product some
people this has worked like miracles on
for their liver I personally used it to
protect my liver and to lower my
cholesterol because accutane can totally
spike your cholesterol and I feel like
this really helped me out so just
something to consider talking to your
doctor about and then the last thing
aqua you need to drink a shit-ton of
water when you're in accutane I got
these glass bottles off of Amazon I've
had these for years these are just what
helps me drink water because I can just
keep them cool I don't have a fridge
that has like the ice and the cool thing
not that fancy
I just keep like six of these in the
fridge at one time so I always have cold
water on hand and you really need to
keep your body hydrated not only for
your body but for your skin I feel like
the amount of water I drink
helped keep my skin hydrated and not as
dry as it could have been at the
beginning is hard to remember to drink
all that water but eventually you just
get used to it and I still drink not
nearly as much as I drank when I was on
accutane but I still drink more water
for sure now than I did before I went on
accutane because I'm just like used to
it now can only help your skin get a
cute water bottle if you have issues
trying to drink water so I contain
starter kit that's everything that I
recommend to you guys these products
really I feel like made my accutane
experience up here when it could have
been like down there where was it going
with that analogy I don't know let me
know down below what has worked for you
as well if there are any products you
think that would be helpful for other
people you can always help each other
out in the comments down below wanna
know more about my accutane experience
and just the side effects and everything
that I went through then you can check
out my acne videos I'll link them down
below if you see an asterisk in the
title of this video and any where it
says accutane just so this video doesn't
get demonetised
always get questions about that YouTube
just D monetizes any drug so that's
great so I don't forget when I'm doing
the description box
on my lips I'm wearing the smashbox
always-on liquid lipstick in
thrill-seeker I love this matte red such
a pretty matte red my bronzer I've been
back on this bronzer train I've been
into this one this is the MUA bronzed
perfection matte and then my face
highlight and also have this little bit
on my forehead is the Alima pure I found
this one in the green beauty video is in
the shade whisper face I only have on a
tiny bit of a BB cream right now this is
the AOA studio perfect BB cream and then
I did my usual under-eye concealers and
stuff but I'm not wearing foundation or
anything today because I wanted to guys
be able to kind of see my skin as we're
talking about it but I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and found it helpful
