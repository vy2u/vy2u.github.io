so I'm drinking cold coffee alright so
today we have a shadow inch mousse on
the look I'm wearing right now that
we're in the new apartment the
background everything will probably be
changing this is the only area of my
room right now that doesn't have boxes
and crap piled all over it feels so good
to be filming again right now I have
five billion things going on right now
but it feels good to just sit down and
film and talk to you guys super excited
for today's video because I'm trying out
some good stuff pure minerals super
frickin excited about some of these
products and I can't wait to tell you
guys about them meet this in your life I
also used some Instagram requested items
in this video things that you guys have
been asking about on Instagram so if you
want to see how I got this look you're
in the right place
just keep watching is that a brush hair
that is sick this is weird I don't think
I've filmed in like a couple weeks and
his first thing in the morning dragon as
that decided to pop up today yay my skin
has been completely clear for last like
two months so once this thing goes away
I'm gonna be making my how I got rid of
backing a video I was moving and I still
don't know where all my makeup is so I'm
just gonna use what we have today got it
so this is a pure minerals 4 in one
liquid 14 hour where foundation and this
has SPF in it the bottle reminds me of
the Clinique what is that one the one
with like the huge wand so this does
look pretty dark for my skin tone this
is the lightest shade it's in light I'm
gonna be mixing this with some Manic
Panic dreamtone we needed my channel
this is my holy grail foundation like
nerd this is how you make any foundation
sure you work for your skin tone if
you're a pale princess I'm just going to
be putting this on the back of my Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works lid and this thing has a pump
hell yeah well that came out really fast
it has a pretty thick consistency is not
really runnin anywhere this is like I've
gone my next few videos will be like a
little bit out of order but I do have
moving vlogs and comb hauls and stuff
coming for you guys that were pre filmed
before I left for Atlanta so those will
be coming this is mixing really nicely
with Manic Panic I think we're gonna go
in with our Beauty Blender and try this
out I primed my face with the LA girl
Pro prep
HG smoothing face primer this was
actually really nice it has the silicone
consistency but it's probably like the
thinnest all right my foundation is
drying my face this is probably the
thinnest silicone face primer I've tried
ooh actually it's really good coverage
actually haven't been using my beauty
blender that much at all I'm using a
brush mostly for my foundation and when
I do use the sponge I don't know why but
I always reach for my miracle complexion
sponge by Real Techniques I don't know
what it is but I feel like that one just
works a little bit better I do like the
way that this is going on is this kind
of been like the coverage that I've been
going for lately where it's not
completely covering up like all of my
freckles and I don't look like I have a
hundred percent perfect skin you can
still see my skin through it but it
gives you like a nice coverage and nice
finish I like the finish of this a lot
it literally looks like skin it kind of
looks like the lumen a BB cream this is
definitely buildable I'm getting more
coverage the second layer means giving
you guys in so you can see what the skin
is looking like right now so you can see
it still looks like skin which I really
like we're gonna put a little concealer
over that but the actual finish of this
foundation is really nice for concealer
I'm gonna go in with the maybelline
superstay better skin concealer a few
guys on Instagram have been asking me
what my thoughts are on this so we're
gonna use it in this video just so I can
talk about it not a huge fan of this
it's just not as good as I was kind of
expecting after all the talk can see
it's a tiny bit dark for what I usually
go for under my eyes but once you blend
it out it actually works out okay it has
this super thin consistency like very
thin almost too thin for my for my
liking there are certain applicators
that I just can't do and this is one of
them it feels super cheap to me and I'm
just not a fan the one thing I like
about this is that it does stay on all
day without creasing at all like it
looks exactly the same at night as when
you put it on in the morning so if you
have a problem creasing you might like
this what do you guys think of my fake
flowers that I love Hobby Lobby is it we
have pumping up right here and maybe
tagging out my stars down here we're
going to accept Android concealer like
always this has been my favorite brush
lately for setting my under eye it's the
a cosmetics heavenly luxe complexion and
this
4:7 supposed to be a concealer I'm a
knight closing my supposed to be a
concealer brush on the other side this
is actually a perfect brush for the
crease I love it i've been using it
almost every single day and the other
end is like a super soft powder brush
you could use this for blush or for
powder all over your face so I have this
four in one pressed powder foundation by
pure minerals I'm hoping that this is
light enough this is in the shade
porcelain i swatched it and it looked
like it could work since my skin has
been getting a lot better
there are some days where I just don't
want to like put on foundation I'll just
put on a little bit of concealer and
powder foundation so I'm always on the
hunt for good good powder foundation I
mean you say it cosmetics heavenly Lux
flat top buff wait do I use this I'm
going to use this guy so it's supposed
to be a no mess no stress application
all-in-one foundation concealer powder
it has SPF 15 which is awesome and it's
vegan friendly and a paraben free coping
this is light enough
first impressions the shave might be a
tiny bit dark but you can just see the
difference like literally look on my
face the side of my face literally looks
like airbrush right now I feel like it
just helped cover the rest of those acne
scars that were peeking through all
right so we can see our forehead right
now is a tiny bit dewy I don't mind that
but let's see if this helps to mattify
it oh yeah
ooh I like how it's still it still looks
like skin you can still see the light
reflecting off of it and it doesn't look
super matte and like dole kind of like
this so for bronzer I've been liking
this city color bronzer this is like
super cheap $2 or $1 or something this
is in the shade a sunrise and it comes
with a little palm tree overlay that
just rubbed off so don't get too excited
if you're all about the palm tree this
isn't really nice like unique shade and
I feel like it's almost like a mix
between a bronzer and a blush on me it
smells kind of funky I just got a whiff
yeah and I don't really contour with
this it's just more to warm up the face
this is gliding over super nice on top
of this foundation I just blend that way
easier than it usually does and put a
little bit on our temples so we look
slim kiss super excited to try this
illuminating powder this is in the shade
afterglow by pure minerals this had
really good reviews on their website so
I'm excited to try this out I feel like
the lighting in this room is a lot
better than my old set up what do you
guys think I've been liking applying my
bronzer first and then my highlight and
then my blush I just feel like it blends
everything together easier ooh okay that
looks way better on the skin than it
does and you swatch it are you guys
seeing that it's actually a really nice
like champagne light kind of highlight
oh hell yeah
need more feeling the highlight lately
speaking of highlight has anyone tried
becca cosmetics jaclyn hill champagne
pop i've been trying to resist getting
it
but I just feel like I need to get it
now is the time feeling blowy I really
like this apparently in the powder
foundation that I put on it also has a
wall FIRREA extract which I do not know
what that is but it's naturally
brightens a look of dark spots and
discoloration which I'm kind of all
about right now because I have so much
acne scarring left over I've been trying
out different brightening products let
me know down below if you guys have any
good remedies for acne scars alright
what's next blush I have been using this
blush already and I freaking love it
this color is great this is in the color
tease I just love the color that it
gives everything is gliding over so
easily
right now I've defined my eyebrow
products I don't even know where they
are every now I'm gonna skip through
this because I have a whole eyebrow
routine already I will link it down
below you can also click on the little
eye in the corner that's a new little
feature thank you youtube you can do it
on mobile so that's kind of its old boy
I'll see you guys when I have my brows
on I'm gonna use this BH Studio Pro
waterproof eye primer in case you go
swimming with a full face of makeup I'm
actually going to the beach later there
will be no makeup born taking a beach
over fourth of July I kind of learned
how to juggle and I'm kind of addicted
to it now alright so I'm just gonna put
a little bit I got way too much on here
you guys are gonna be on snapchat super
freaking excited because I've been
trying out this palette and you kind of
need it in your life this is probably
the softest matte palette I've ever
tried this is the sole mattes
by I just got that I kept the box
because I just wanted to show you how
cool it was it's like this reflective
silver but look at how freakin fancy
this is right this looks like one of
those things you get like a gift card in
this could entertain me for hours here
is a close-up for what this looks like
oh my god the lighting in here is so
much better guys can actually see when I
hold something up this shade I am
freakin obsessed with these shades are
super nice remind me of the revealed 2
palette take the 3rd shade in right here
we're gonna put a little bit this crease
it also has a really nice big mirror
who's getting toasty in here I'm really
liking how my skin look
right now it actually feels so good to
be putting like a full face of makeup on
right now because I feel like I haven't
done that in too long too long right so
I'm taking this shade right here and
we're just gonna put some lip these are
so soft
I could literally rub my finger in this
for hours soft super pigmented which
that combination is a little rare for
matte shadows then I'm going to take the
darkest shade in the palette purple
color then we have some black eye shadow
on here whoops I'm just gonna put this
on the outer 1/3 of my eye and I'm gonna
go back in with the blending brush and
I'm going to take this warm brown shade
which is like one of my favorites right
here and I'm just gonna put this in the
crease eliminate those harsh lines I'm
going to take that warm brown shade and
we're gonna blend out our bottom lash
line actually like to take this a little
bit down because we're gonna be putting
a darker color in there as well and this
will just help blend it out I'm going
with the darkest shade that we used
again and just put a little bit of this
on the outer third or just in the elbow
this light pink shade in here and just
put a tiny bit of this in the center on
the lid camera got too hot and had to
chill for a second but all I did was go
in with some black eyeliner on my
waterline and then added some of this
Brown the dark brown shade right here
I see used a flat brush and went against
my waterline for nanner corner highlight
we're just gonna use a face highlight
and use this shade from the wet and wild
trio just pop this right in the inner
corner going with my favorite position
was formula eye booster a bunch of you
guys have been snapchatting me pictures
of this I just like to flick up and then
connect there you go winged eyeliner in
like three seconds so I can connect
those edges when we go in with a black
eye shadow where the wing ends and then
where my bottom lash line is we're just
going to connect those with a little
black as you like this helps to
everything together it also makes your
eyes look bigger because if you over
dropped your wing I'm going to cease
socialize vixen lashes I've never tried
socialize a youtuber Krista actually
this is her brand which is really
awesome
these look exactly what I'm all about in
a lash no I'm not going through them
since I'm low on battery I'm going to
apply these lashes and it'll be right
back lashes are on and I'm kind of in
love with these I feel like these are
gonna be my new favorite lashes they're
just so wispy and separated I love them
I also applied some bottom mascara in my
wet n Wild mega length I think we're
gonna do a purple lip I have some very
mixed feelings on the colour-pop ultra
matte lips love the colors have a little
issue with the formula I think I'm gonna
be doing a hole at their review on these
let me know if you guys want a full
review on the color pop Matt lick liquid
lipsticks I feel like they're a little
bit overhyped but that's just my
personal opinion I haven't used these
two colours yet though so I want to see
how the formula is on these ones zipper
you don't need a lip liner with these so
I just go in
we can't go over these too much or they
will start to crumble this one is
feeling so dry on my lips right now very
dry so here's what the makeup looks like
up close and personal
alright so this is the final look I'm
feeling it I love the skin I feel like
my skin looks so freakin healthy right
now and like glowy but it doesn't look
caked on at all if you liked this video
and you want to see more shadow movies
get ready with me videos give it a
thumbs up so I know love you guys thanks
for watching see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
