schmooze on the look I'm wearing right
now this is a little bit of a more
dramatic look decided to just get a
little get a little while today this is
my fourth cup of coffee I've had today
because it's that kind of day I think I
microwave this same cup like ten times
so most of the products that I'm using
in this video are from glambot if you
follow me on any social media you know
that I'm obsessed with glam by the
amount with money I spent on there and
last month is a little absurd
they're basically a pre-loved pre-owned
makeup site where you can buy discounted
high-end and limited-edition makeup I'm
freakin obsessed with it I sign up for
their email newsletters because you get
notified every time there's a sale and
 kits sold fast your sales are
awesome I have never been disappointed
by glambot purchase so far I'll have
them down below so you guys can check it
out for yourself I use the Laura Mercier
silk cream foundation in this video
which I've been wanting to try for
forever and a bunch of other good stuff
so if you want to see how I got this
look you're in the right place just keep
watching so I'm using my new Sony nex-5
T to film this right now and it has
autofocus heck yeah I can't figure out
how to get it brighter right now this is
as bright as I could get it roommate
just started vacuuming it's gonna be an
interesting video I was gonna hope that
I can brighten this up when I go back to
edit it on the computer because I really
can't figure out how to get it any
brighter I've already primed my face
with the Tarte clean slate flawless 12
hour brightening primer yeah this is a
huge ass tube for primer like that's the
size of my face it reminds me of the
chords primer it smells exactly the same
house in the same feel - it feels more
like a moisturizer than like a silicon
based primer I also use some of the
Maybelline a baby skin primer on my nose
and just areas that my pores are bigger
and now we're gonna go into a foundation
so I found the Laura Mercier still cream
foundation one glambot and I've been
wanting to try this for a while this is
in the shade cream ivory I hope this is
a lighter shade I'm pretty sure this is
a lighter shade and it looks pretty
freakin dark so we'll see and try and
make it work I've heard really awesome
things about this foundation well looks
pretty thick has a super strong smell it
smells exactly like play-doh that guy
turned up the ring light in my face goes
darker alright I'm just gonna take my
Beauty Blender which I just got it and I
should get my mirror I washed the Beauty
Blender for the first time today and
pink
I came out so that was interesting Ellis
is way too dark this is pretty dark but
I'm going to try and make it work I'm
going to blend it down my neck and then
we're just gonna conceal a lot to
lighten everything up that's pretty
decent coverage this was like a thin
first coat you can still see acne scars
and stuff but it evened out my skin tone
oh yeah so here's one layer I would say
it's a medium coverage you can
definitely still see acne scars and some
acne like peeking through I'm gonna go
in with it second layer and see how much
coverage we can get and I did already
have my brows done because I went to the
dermatologist billiard today I can't
leave your house without your brows on
alright ladies so know how I feel about
this smell
secondly I covered up a lot more the
coverage and everything looks pretty
nice it looks like a satin finish by
going with the Naked skin by Urban Decay
concealer this is in the shade fair this
is the lightest shade and it's perfect
this has been my favorite concealer
lately you'll probably be singing it in
my what month is it April reason range I
can believe was almost made with the
book I like to blend it in with my
finger this feels really interesting on
top of this foundation then I'm gonna go
back in with the Beauty Blender and just
blend I just moved the ring light behind
the camera and I think that might have
helped silver issues a little bit
the foundation is creasing on my eyelid
I like just put this anywhere where we
put concealer I got the Mac what is this
porcelain this is just like a loose
powder that I found on glambot I don't
know if this is a translucent powder or
if it's just a really light powder so
I'm just putting some of this in the lid
I'm going to take my Sedona lace FBO 3
brush we're just gonna set the rest of
the foundation
I'm pretty sure that was completely
translucent but my skin looks really
nice so I'm going to go in with my
favorite Sedona lace contour palette and
I've mentioned this a few times but I
love the white shade in here
I think Sedona lace has been sold out of
this for a while I'll tweet it out when
they're back in stock I'm just going to
take that white powder to brighten up
the under eye and then just other areas
of her face and since foundation is
pretty dark so to contour I'm going to
take this lightest contour shade in here
on a 850 sitting on lace brush I'm gonna
take a tiny bit of this on my temples I
got this shimmer brick compact as the
Bobbi Brown look at how freakin pretty
that is literally I've had my eye on
this thing for like years and I finally
picked it up because it was discounted
on glambot gotta love it I'm gonna take
my Sedona lace 813 brush and all of the
brushes I use pretty much are from the
vortex set I always have them listed
down below and there's also a four
dollar off coupon code oh heck yeah I
feel like that gives like the perfect
amount of color I really like that as I
literally just closed it on my finger I
feel like I just got a spray tan or
something clamp but sometimes throws in
like free gift things and they put in
the Tarte BB cream is this is a BB
tinted primer which is interesting it is
in the shade medium so I'll probably be
giving this away okay well I totally
forgot I was gonna use the benefit
what's up what's up oh I'm not gonna use
this so they don't want to put cream on
top of the powder I just put on and I
actually used steal alike kitten as a
highlight this is another thing that
I've been eyeing for years and I finally
just got it this is technically an
eyeshadow but we're gonna try it as a
highlight and see what happens all right
that's real intense pulling that out
with a brush after that side actually
looks really pretty I sprayed my face
with the L'Oreal infallible setting
spray Urban Decay 24/7 slide on and
glide on whatever this is called in
clash and well that's a satisfying so
I'm gonna put this all over the eyelid I
want to do like an intense blue black
smokey eye I don't think
ever done that I'm not gonna bring this
into our crease because we're only gonna
be putting blue on the lid I'm gonna
take this shade for my cosmetic
sculpting palette just so we have a
transition color in the crease this
lighting is really unflattering also
feel like I need sunglasses right now
because the ring light is literally on
the highest setting I'm gonna go in with
a black eye shadow and we're gonna put
this probably everywhere except the
middle I'm gonna start by making a small
v-shape and blending inwards I'm turning
this brush sideways and then just
dragging whatever is left over towards
the inner corner whenever I put on blue
eye shadow I just feel like I'm back in
like eighth grade
I'm just really packing on that black on
the outer third 863 brush and blend
literally feel like I'm being blinded
right now so I got this NARS duo which
I'm obsessed with how freakin cool like
these colors so I think I'm gonna go on
with the bright blue one I'm just gonna
take my finger and put this on the lid
and see what happens
hell yeah I think this might have
actually been limited edition that it's
called rated-r I love nerds names so
think about glambot is that you can get
limited edition stuff so if you're like
a Mac hoarder or anything a limited
edition usually eBay and stuff like jack
up the prices on limitation stuff and
glambot it's like cheaper than it
originally was I'm gonna go back in with
black and bringing this all the way in
not dropping all of the product there
though I'm gonna start on the outside
and then just blend whatever is left
over on the inner corner for liner I am
obviously going in with my favorite
Physicians Formula I booster why did I
just get out of breath
all right the wings are on I'm going
with black eyeliner on the waterline
we're gonna be massively smoking this
out so I'm gonna go back in with black
eye shadow I'm going with T's and just
put this underneath to blend it you can
just go in with whatever color used on
the crease I'm debating whether I want
to do like a shiny mint green on the
inner corner or a white internal temp
just got to cut again try 5004 filming
this video so I'm gonna go in with the
Pandora duo from NARS as well and we're
just gonna put this on the inner corner
I'm keeping this mostly on the lower
lash line this almost looks more like
silver than white I'm gonna take another
white this is a matte white from the
lorac Pro palette lorac I'm going with
my eye emo glam 12 lashes these have
been my favorite lately but you have our
lashes on I put it top and bottom
mascara on as well for Enda lips so I
got the OCC lip tar I've never used
these before now that I did my eyes I'm
kind of thinking that might be too much
rice I'm gonna go in with the NYX
retractable lip liner this isn't pretty
in pink I'm just slightly filling this
in I'm just watch this thing to see how
neon it is super pigmented I think this
would be way too much with these eyes
I'm Nia's Drug cosmetic sugar mama all
right so this is the final look if you

thumbs up so I know but let me know down
