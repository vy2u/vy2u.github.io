folks wedding season is in full force
maybe you still have prom coming up I
wanted to do a look that you could wear
for any kind of a special event all of
the makeup I used on my face today is
under $20 and all the outfits I'm gonna
be showing you guys are also under $20
which is amazing for special event
dresses because as you know formal
dresses can be friggin pricey event kind
of dresses are usually something that
you spend a ton of money on and then you
literally wear them like once or twice
so I found so many cute dresses on
thredUP for under 20 bucks I feel like
this is the perfect option if you need
something affordable for an event
because you can get high-end name brands
for literally up to 90 percent off I
partnered with rod up for this video you
guys know I'm addicted to thread up you
can just find such good deals on there I
found some of my favorite jeans on there
I think I really love bout thread up is
that the stuff they put on there looks
like a new it's super easy to navigate
through their site because you just
select the size you want the color the
price point the brand you can search by
pretty much anything and I found these
dresses in literally about 20 minutes
because I just put in all that criteria
so I'm gonna show you guys a few of the
dress options that I found on there and
I also found shoes in my size which is
hard to find in box for 120 bucks and
then we'll get into the makeup part of
this video and I'll show you guys how I
got this look but if you want to check
out thread up thread up is hooking you
guys up with a 25% off discount code if
you use the code burrito 25 you'll get
25% off your first order so I'll have
the link for thread up right at the top
of the description box down below but
I'm excited to show you guys the dresses
that I found one of my favorite parts of
getting a thread up box in the mail is
the polka dot tissue paper how freakin
cute is this so this is a box that it
comes in I'm just gonna show you guys a
few of the dresses that I found and the
heels I also got on there but this first
dress is the one that I kind of centered
this whole make up look around so this
dress that I have on right now is by the
brand French Connection the estimated
retail price for this one was $119 and I
got it for 20 99 so a little bit over
$20 but it counts 99 cents this is a
body con dress and I feel like body con
dresses are usually pretty flattering
because they just kind of suck
everything in I do still wear Spanx
underneath pretty much any dress that I
wear because why not it's comfortable I
can move in this one it doesn't
like too tight some of these can be
really thick and you pretty much can't
breathe
I do have a wedding coming up which is
how I thought of this video idea so you
guys might be seeing this dress on
Instagram in a couple months because I
feel like this is a contender for the
wedding this next dress is this really
fun kind of sequined dress from Express
estimated retail price for this one it's
80 bucks I got it for $17.99 I also love
that thread up puts a little tag on here
so you you just feel like you're
actually shopping and it feels like new
but this one I thought would be fun for
like New Year's Eve - this one's a tiny
bit big I probably could like pin it in
certain areas it still fits and it's
comfy it has this like stretch to it and
it's a nice thick material this one
might be a New Year's Eve option the
next one's also tiny bit big on me I
feel like it could be a little bit
tighter but it's this off-the-shoulder
cocktail dress by Valerie Bertinelli and
it was $14.99 and it's dark blue I feel
like this would be really pretty with
like gold jewelry and maybe even like a
deeper lip 14.99
and then this last one is one of those
dresses that I feel it could be either
totally dressed up or dressed down I
like buying those kind of items because
you can just wear it for multiple uses
so it is more flowy and it's almost like
kind of a bohemian dress has some lace
detail on the sleeves and flow your
sleeves but I feel like you could
totally dress this one up with layering
like gold jewelry or even some gold
hoops you could have like a gold clutch
or just have like a fancier purse but
the estimated retail for this one is $71
and I got it for $17.99 this one I would
also wear with just like a jean jacket
and flats in the summer and because it's
so flowy and loose it'll just be really
comfy for that this one is a win alright
so let's get into the make up part of
this video I did a full face every
product that I use is under 20 bucks as
well I did a pretty neutral eye so you
could kind of wear this with pretty much
any color dress you could just swap out
the lip color for something that matched
your dress here we go
alright so today's set up is a little
interesting because the movers come
tomorrow so I'm literally stacked I have
you guys stacked up on cardboard boxes
right now so I've already washed
moisturize primed my face I'm wearing
the dress that I chose so we're gonna
like Center this whole look around this
light gold kind of color and for my hair
I just did like a little French braid
kind of thing in the front and then
basically just like put a shit-ton of
bobby pins in my hair and made a little
bun so I'm gonna start out with this NYX
do we finish setting spray I actually
don't think I've tried this if I have
it's been a while last night at 10 p.m.
I had to make a trip to the drugstore
because there were three things that I
could not find because they were packed
in boxes so I had to pick up a setting
spray so that's what we're trying this
one today
another drugstore one I really like is a
hard candy black bottle one I'm gonna go
in with my poor perfecting primer by
Revlon I'm just gonna take a little bit
of this between my fingers and just put
it right where I have some major pores
and this just tones it down actually
works I've talked about this a lot so
foundation I'm gonna be mixing CYO
long-lasting life proof this is one of
my favorite if not my favorite drugstore
foundations in 101 with Maybelline fit
me doing smooth an 1:15 I've been liking
this one especially on camera this looks
really great on camera it's very
smoothing it's not the most long-lasting
so mixing it with this definitely helps
I could just use this one I'm just in
the mood to mix it I'm just going to
stipple this on my Sigma f80 if you have
oily skin you'll definitely want to set
this combo one of my favorite drugstore
powders is the Maybelline fit me loose
powder that one's a bomb when I had oily
skin before accutane I would use that
one and it really does help my makeup
stay on didn't break me out with the dry
skin I don't need to set my foundation
which is for a good amazing if you have
dry skin try not setting out with the
powder it looks so much more skin like
when you don't set it with the powder a
lot of times you really don't need to
because your skin isn't causing the
foundation to melt off your face so
whatever is left over I'm just gonna
build up on my scarring right here do
you why oh you can really build up so
the best concealer combo I've found to
date for my under eyes personally in the
coverage and everything I like is a
flower beauty light illusion concealer
mixed in with the k'kaw concealer this
combo is amazing this one is under $20
18 bucks if you want just a drugstore
option and you don't want to mix two
concealers then you could do Maybelline
fit me concealer or maybelline instant
age rewind both of those are bomb I've
done a lot of videos recently talking
about kind of like my favorites I did
what's in my everyday makeup drawer I
did a drugstore makeup starter kit so if
you want to know kind of like my top in
those categories then you check out
those videos so my under-eye setting
powders I managed to drop in the toilet
in Chicago I just got back from Chicago
Daigo I managed to drop both my major
pressed powder and my Physicians Formula
powder in the toilet so I've already
ordered a new major one from the wish
app but it's not supposed to be here for
like two weeks I'm just gonna use my
physician formula once today just like I
said don't set my entire face I usually
do set just this part so that I can
easily blend powder stuff on top of it
like my bronzer and everything so I'm
gonna try this Revlon Photoready powder
it said illuminating on the little
display thing hopefully this isn't one
of those powders that like takes away
the coverage for me don't know how
illuminating that is for as I'm using my
usual Maybelline tattoo studio for an
eyeshadow base I'm just gonna take my
same concealer Maybelline instant age
rewind concealer is actually really good
eyes shadow primer so moving on to
contour I love having kind of a more
strong contour for special events makeup
because in photos is just gonna make
your cheekbones kind of stand out so I'm
gonna take my ELF eyebrow kit in the
shade light this is an eyebrow powder
but it is amazing for a contour for
fair-skinned I'm also gonna take this
just on the tip of my nose just gives a
little bit more shape and then a little
bit underneath my bottom lip to make it
look more plump
just puts a shadow under there and it
makes your bottom look look a little bit
bigger I'm gonna go in with blush first
and see if I'm feeling a bronzer on top
we can always add it after I've been
really into this one this is CYO tell it
straight super pretty
glowy blush has a little bit of like
peach in there pinky peach I brought
this one with me in Chicago this is
definitely a glowy blush like you can
see the glow there I'm just gonna blend
everything out so for eyeshadow I'm
gonna be using the BH Cosmetics Carli
bybel deluxe edition palette you can get
this thing on sale for I think around
$11 I did a video on my favorite
affordable eyeshadow palettes under 20
bucks so you watch that video on and on
my other one so to go with this dress I
feel like I could almost go either way I
could use some of the pinks in here I
could use even like the Purple's think
I'm kind of just feeling like a
champagne I oh yeah I'm gonna do a
highlight what am i doing so I'm just
gonna take this shade I might add a
little bit of the white in there
depending on how it turns out oh yeah
bring a little bit this on my Cupid's
bow just whatever is left over my face
is already pretty glowy right now so I'm
not gonna go to him with the nose
highlight so start out I'm gonna go in
with this light tan shade for a
transition pop that into the crease next
I'm gonna go in with this matte brown
shade right here I'm starting by making
kind of like a v-shape right here and
then I'm gonna blend it inwards a bit
then whatever's leftover on my brush now
I'm just taking the same brush this is
the japonesque brush and blending
inwards and then also up a little bit
into the crease using that same blending
brush I'm just going to lightly blend
out the edges here I don't want to bring
the brown too high so I just want it to
kind of fade out right there now I want
to deepen it up a little bit with this
cooler toned almost like it's like a
gory Brown a brown and I'm just placing
that right into the crease I just want
to define it a little bit more back into
blending now on my finger I'm gonna go
in with this super pretty shade that
pretty much almost exactly like matches
my dress
I'm just taking on my finger and I'm
gonna press it right on my lid I'll
probably use a brush afterwards just to
get it exactly where I want it but you
get the best color payoff usually if you
use your finger with lid trades so I'm
bringing this all the way in and then
kind of just using my finger to lightly
fade it into that Brown so I'm gonna use
that same shade but just wet it with the
setting spray that just gives it the
like extra metallic look now for an
extra extra pop I'm taking that same
face highlight shade I used this big
pink one right here it looks lighter
when it's on your skin so I'm just
pressing this right on the center and
that is definitely giving us a little
some extra right there for my inner
corner I'm gonna take this white shade
right here I'm gonna line my waterline
with some black eyeliner this one sharp
ish like quite a little bit but I'm
gonna add some black eyeshadow and stuff
and like blend out the lower lash line
and make it super smokey but first I'm
gonna put on some liquid eyeliner to my
top we're gonna do a wing why does this
one brow hair always want to chill down
here get in your zone bro my eyes have
been getting more droopy by the day
literally
so wings are
that's as good as we're gonna get now
we're gonna work on the lower lashline
so I'm gonna go back in with the pallet
there isn't a black shade so I think
what I'm gonna do is just smudge some
black liner down there but first I'm
gonna take the darkest brown shade in
here which is this one taking a flat
edge brush and I'm just gonna line that
right underneath my lashes I'm gonna go
back with the eyeliner now and just kind
of smudge it out we go onto this brown
shade now I'm just a really tiny smudger
brush and keep blending down there so
before we put on false lashes I'm just
gonna coat my upper lashes with a little
bit of mascara I just like to do this
because it hides your natural lashes a
bit more if you are not a lashes where
normally and you're just doing this for
a special event I definitely try and
practice a few times before you actually
try and put them on for the real event
my biggest tip is to let your lash glue
dry down to the point where it's almost
dry before you stick it on your eyes
this is the kiss strip lash adhesive
with a low and lashes I'm gonna be using
our the I'll or number 120 ones you can
get these on Ulta these give you a nice
dramatic eye but they're still kind of
lighter on the inside and more dramatic
right here so it doesn't look like too
overpowering they just look really nice
and almost like cat eye like so that is
all the lash glue I use you don't need a
ton the key is just to let it dry
so as my lash glue is drying I'm gonna
spray on some setting spray I don't feel
like I need a whole lot more do right
now so I'm gonna just do a tiny little
spritz of this okay so now that my
lashes are on I'm gonna put on some
bottom lash mascara my favorite is wet
and wild mega length I'm just going for
something a little bit more neutral that
could work with any of the dresses that
I showed you guys in the beginning so
I'm gonna take this NYX liner this is in
the shade 860 peekaboo natural and just
line my lips with this first I'm kind of
ringing this all over my lip too so over
top of that I'm gonna go onto CYO
metallic liquid lipstick this is in the
shade plead the fifth this is a super
pretty pink kind of rose gold alright
and then I want to lighten this a tiny
bit you could totally leave it at this
if you like this color I'm gonna go with
my Maybelline vivid hot lacquer Angie's
mostly just on the center and that just
toned it down a little bit alright so
this is the final makeup look everything
that I used on my face and that I'm
wearing on my body right now from
thredUP is under 20 bucks so I hope you
