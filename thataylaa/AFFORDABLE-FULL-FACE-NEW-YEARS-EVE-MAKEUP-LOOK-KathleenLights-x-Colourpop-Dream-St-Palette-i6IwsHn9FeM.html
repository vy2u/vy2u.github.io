gonna happen you know possibilities are
endless
all right so today we are gonna be doing
a New Year's Eve makeup and it's almost
2018 that is wild
I feel like New Year's Eve is one of my
favorite makeup holidays because you get
to wear glitter you get to do literally
anything you want you could do that any
day of the year you do you but I mean
blue eye shadow and glitter just feels
right so every single thing I'm using in
this video is affordable from the
drugstore or
Ulta besides this so I want to try us
out this is color pop this is still
affordable this whole palette is sixteen
bucks is Kathleen's new dream street
palette that she collaborated with color
pop on wide I just like full-body
Twitter so I hope you guys enjoy this
video if you do while you're watching
don't forget to give it a thumbs up I
know we're a little bit early for New
Year's Eve Christmas hasn't even
happened yet but I wanted to give you
guys time to go get the products and
practice it just play with makeup
whatever you want to do with this video
so if you want to see how I got this
look you're in the right place just keep
watching all right we are gonna be
playing with glitter today so it's a
good day any day you can put glitter on
your face good day in my book so I've
already washed and moisturize I'm gonna
prep my skin using this year I'm
dehydrating primer miss bye hard candy
maybe I should clip back my hair just
saw a clip where did you go how do
things just disappear literally into
thin air on this desk oh here it is hard
candy you can get at Walmart I love this
setting spray for super dewy skin I like
to use it under or over it does have
like a sticky kind of tacky feel to it
so some people don't like that over
makeup but it doesn't really bother me
too much but when you spray this like
you definitely feel it on your arms kind
of sticky so I don't have anything on my
lips right now cuz lately when I've been
putting aquaphor on before my foundation
it like gets this ring where the
foundation won't adhere to so that's why
my lips are looking pretty chapped so
for a foundation I haven't tried this
combo before but I kind of wanna today
I'm gonna mix the la girl pro coverage
in the shade porcelain with the CYO
long-lasting lifeproof foundation I
think this foundation used to break me
out so hopefully that doesn't happen I'm
just doing about half and half and I'm
gonna use the Eco tool sponge I just did
a comparison video using this with the
Real Techniques sponge so I'll link that
and I
down below combos looking pretty nice
and dewy the shade is looking really
nice
mixed together has a nice beige tone to
it I already used up that amount so I'm
gonna pump some more out so I am back in
major pre-filming mode right now because
I just got back from California and then
I go to North Carolina in like three
days and then I go pretty much straight
from North Carolina to Europe for
January so I have like two days in
between that I just I'm getting my
accutane blood test for so I have to be
here so basically I'm trying to get my
usual three videos a week done before I
leave for North Carolina for all January
in December so I'm trying to pull it off
don't know how it's gonna go
I'm gonna just layer this up a little
bit to see if I can build up the
coverage so my scarring and stuff is ooh
build a nice I forgot that this la girl
foundation oxidizes quite a bit I think
it's already yeah it's already darkening
but those two mixed together look really
nice and smooth if you like a dewy
finish alright woah we are dewy the for
concealer I'm gonna go in with the
Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade
15 which is lighter than 10 I'm pretty
sure one of you guys tweeted me saying
that they came out with a lighter shade
maybe I think it was this concealer if
so I'm gonna get on that since this one
is pretty moisturizing I like to let it
sit for just like 30 seconds to kind of
set down before I go out and blend it
out this concealer has been sitting the
best on my skin lately just makes it
look so nice and smooth and flawless
under there and go down the center of my
face just to brighten it up a little bit
I'm just gonna smooth it out with that
sponge for setting my under eyes I
always use these two Physicians Formula
powders I just mix them both will be
linked down below along with everything
else on my face I just kind of mix them
depending on like what my foundation
shade looks like at the moment so the
only part of my face I've been setting
is this area so that when I go to blend
out powder products on top it doesn't
drag I'm just using that same Physicians
Formula powder of the darker shade and
I'm just setting this area
face think I'm gonna just lightly set
just right here in the center cuz I feel
like it's a little too little to do
right there like I'm powering through
this right now before going in for brows
I actually want to prime my eyes so I'm
gonna take some of the NYX pink
motorcycle eyeshadow base just a white
eyeshadow base and I'm just gonna put
this on the lid I haven't used this in
so long since this is white it really
helps to make any shades just pop gives
it a nice base I'm just gonna let that
chill there and set a little bit while I
do my eyebrows the fur brows I'm gonna
start with my usual Ulta brow tint and
deep this is what I use pretty much
every day comb through this just super
quickly adds pigment to your brows
basically so that basically just adds
color now I'm gonna add some shape to
them so I'm gonna go with the elf ultra
precise brow pencil I think this is
fairly new from them it has a really
nice stiffness to it and you can get
those lines so I'm gonna draw some lines
in the front
I think this shade is a little bit light
for me but it'll work in the front yeah
like it's just thin enough and stiff
enough that you can draw on those lines
which is really nice eyebrows done so
I'm gonna go on to bronzer and I
actually picked up when I was in San
Diego I picked up the lighter or the
darker shade of the butter bronzer this
is the bronzer shade the other ones
called light bronze and the light bronze
I've talked about before it looks so
orange on my skin tone and I actually
preferred the darker shade better it has
less of an orange tint to it it is a
little bit dark so I kind of have to use
a light hand with it or else it can look
way too intense but I'm gonna use this
and I'm actually gonna use the brush I
usually use for blush cuz it just gives
it more of like a diffused look this one
was in the Amazon brush set I did a
whole video testing it out and I love
this brush for blush so woah we got some
Creason yeah used with the light hand
and with kind of a diffusing brush this
shade looks really pretty it's a shame
they made that so orange because the
shade like the lightness that make sense
is there it's just too orange okay I'm
gonna bring this one a little bit up on
my
temples sometimes I'm into the temple
bronze sometimes I'm not are using that
same brush I'm gonna go into this blush
also picked up this one there this is in
the shade rose this is really pretty I
don't know why I hadn't tried these Hart
blushes before this one is like a nice
wintery warm kind of pink so just to
blend like the under eye area and
everything if you like to take just a
empty powder brush the fur face
highlight when you use one of my
favorites of all time from the drugstore
this is the Jade cat you glow girl in
Bella Rose I've talked about this issue
a ton this is such a beautiful highlight
if you haven't picked this up yet it is
on Alta now and it's gorgeous
you guys will be seeing this in my best
of 2017 makeup video which I'm actually
filming today but it will be coming in a
couple weeks this is so friggin pretty I
want to reiterate that I only recommend
this shade because I have tried other
shades in this line and the formulas not
quite the same some of them are kind of
like gritty and glittery this one is
what I recommend so I'm just gonna pop
this on the cheekbones oh my god look at
it so beautiful and it has like a pink
tint to it we're just gonna ignore that
some major creasing happening cuz I'm
gonna put shadow on to set it in a
second I wanted to go for something a
little more intense because it's New
Year's Eve
you know you want your highlight to show
up in photos and everything and there's
something about the shade of this one
that just looks really wintery to me it
has like a light pink tint to it looks
like snow like angelic you know what I
mean okay so for eyeshadow I'm super
excited try this is the dream Street
kathleenlights by color pop collection
this is pretty much solely why I'm
calling this video affordable instead of
drugstore because you can't get this
technically at the drugstore but it's
still pretty affordable the shades in
here look gorgeous I'm excited to play
with these I think what I want to do is
a blue kind of smokey eye like a deep
blue and then put black glitter over top
and I feel like you could probably do
this look with something similar if you
don't want to do blue you could do like
a deep purple if it matches your outfit
or whatever better but I really want to
try the blue shades in here so first I'm
gonna go in with the kind of transition
me shade right here and put this into
the grease oh this looks like um makeup
geek what's it called what is that one
called can't think of it right now
the famous makeup geek transition shade
peach Sun but not really nicely and I'm
kind of dragging it over that white a
little bit just to set it a tiny bit
this is one of those days I've had three
cups of coffee and I feel like I've had
like two sips what do I want to start
out with I think I want to do the matte
blue shade that one has quite a bit of
kick up right there I want to do like a
faded really deep smoky I probably
should have done my eyeshadow first with
this look I'm just blending this
creating like a v-shape right there I
feel like my mic isn't on that's on I'm
gonna blend out the edges after I just
want to kind of get this down for some
reason I was looking a lot bluer on this
eye I don't know if you guys can see
that I don't think there was anything on
this brush maybe there was a little bit
of black or something on this brush
verse this side definitely looks more
like deep grey and this one's looking
more true to color how it looks in the
pan yeah there must been something on
this brush I'm gonna go back in and try
and get some more blue going here
alright so there we go I basically just
kept Larry and that blue on until I got
somewhat the same on both sides but it
blends out really easily for a deep kind
of blue shade so now on my finger I'm
gonna take the shimmery blue shade ooh
that looks pretty I'm excited oh heck
yeah so I'm showing up on cameras good
there that is super pretty I almost
don't even want to put glitter over top
of this
I was gonna blend out the edges a little
bit with that same first kind of tan
shade I went in with that sure there's a
really nice transition before I do the
lower lash line we're gonna attempt to
pop on some glitter so this is the NYX
glitter goals it looks like this a
little holiday set thing it comes with
the glitter primer and then three
different shades you get like a black
silver and green looks like emerald
green is actually it's probably really
pretty I actually have never used the
NYX glitter primer this is cool they're
kind of like a stack oh sweet just stack
together
tap out some black glitter in the lid it
looks like it's a really fine glitter
which will be nice yeah almost looks
like brown just black it might be brown
now that I'm looking at it either way I
think that'll look cool on top of the
blue and if not I'll just add in some
silver sparkle in there so I'm gonna use
the glitter glue I'm just gonna squeeze
some of this on a brush and then tap
this right on my lid where I want that
glitter which is everywhere I went over
the eyeshadow nice so that's good and
I'm gonna use that same brush just wipe
off the glue I'm just gonna Pat this
right on my lid and hope that we don't
get should tend to fall out oh that is
beautiful hell yeah it's really nice
this is actually kind of sheer enough
that you see some of the blue through it
very pretty I'm getting a little bit of
Fallout not bad though for the amount of
glitter that's on my eyeball right now
that glitter glue is pretty sweet I like
that it doesn't rub off your eyeshadow
underneath and I'm just pressing this in
so it can adhere to the glue not bad
fall out for putting loose glitter this
glitter is definitely not black it
almost looks like a dark cool toned
Brown my favorite waterline eyeliner
hands-down drugstore and Han is the LA
girl glide on gel pencil
I looked for about 20 minutes last night
to try and find a pencil sharpener don't
ask me how I have an entire room and
makeup and I can't find a sharpener but
I can't so we're gonna go in with the
Maybelline lasting drama waterproof gel
pencil instead as it is here and it is
sharp go back with this palette and
press the blue shade on the lower lash
line just going to use a flat edge
aligner
for this then I'm just gonna blend that
out with the first shade again a tan
shade Peach Smoothie that was called
makeup geek Peach Smoothie I think so oh
yeah this silver shade was so soft I
might put this on the inner corner
that's really pretty I'm gonna spray my
brush for this so I'm just using an elf
spray mist and fix whatever it's called
and then put the shade right on the
inner corner oh that's pretty
oh it has a little bit of like green
reflect to it that looks really pretty
with the blue so don't think I want to
do a full-on winged liner because I'm
gonna be using pretty intense lashes
these are the aisle or 120 ones I love
these these things have a pretty intense
kind of cat eye look to them they get
pretty dramatic on the outer part right
here so usually you don't even need
liner yeah we're not gonna do liner if I
could find my scissors that would be
awesome so I always trim my lashes down
you just measure it against your eye and
then see where you want to cut off
before I put this on I'm just gonna do a
thin coat of mascara forgot how much
that la thing oxidizes this is just a
Catrice glam and doll and I just like to
do a thin coat just so my lashes are
black underneath the falsies so before
we put on the false lashes I'm just
gonna set my face with that same elf
setting spray my favorite drugstore
setting spray is the hard candy in the
black bottle or the L'Oreal in the black
bottle I kind of lean towards a hard
candy though I just have so many setting
sprays that I'm trying to go through
before I repurchase those which is why
I'm using this one today I always set my
face I feel like naked if I don't set my
face
but especially with a loose glitter on
your face and for New Year's you never
know what's gonna happen you know
possibilities are endless you'll
probably want to set your face mmm that
smelled like some kind of cocktail all
right now that we've got those top
lashes dryin I feel like these are
perfect for New Year's so I'm gonna go
in with bottom lash mascara now this is
my wet and wild make a length how many
times have you seen me use this so since
we have blue eye shadow and glitter on
my eyeballs right now I wanted to just
keep it simple with the lip so I'm going
to do a new
it's gonna take this le girl ultimate
intense is in the shade and non-stop
nude i line my lips with this now for
lipstick i'm gonna go in with maybelline
totally toffee i love this shade so
pretty i do want it a little bit lighter
so I'm gonna put some 755 nude thrill
right on the center also by Maybelline
I guess all over there we go but this is
the final look like I said you could
basically swap out the blue for any
color you wanted I think that shade of
glitter would work over any more like
cool toned eyeshadow I'm excited to play
around with a dream Street palette more
congratulations Kathleen if you're
watching this probably isn't but the
shades that I use blended beautifully I
really like how it turned out and that
inner corner shade I am feeling that
would be so pretty all over the lid if
you wanna know how I did my hair
literally all I did was take my flat
iron and curl it away from my face
that's all I do to curl my hair
I'll have the flatter and I use down
blow but it's really basic and I think I
have an old video on it and so using the
same flat iron and everything so that
will be linked down below I hope you

safe New Year's Eve I will be chillin
