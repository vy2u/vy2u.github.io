talking all about hair mostly about
taping extensions because I've actually
had tape ins now for I checked on
Instagram and it's been about a year
almost exactly a year which is wild I
literally thought it'd have been about
six to eight months nope before that I
had fusion extensions we'll get into
that I've had about four different kinds
of tape and extensions so I feel like
I'm at a solid point where I can tell
you guys just overall what I think of
them things to know before you get them
things that are hard with them things
that are easy with them and know what I
think and we're gonna be answering a
bunch of your questions from Twitter too
so if you're excited for this video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up if
you're new here you can join the baby
doe family and subscribe upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific
time I also have a few different hair
videos that go more into my hair
background and how we ended up in this
lovely place of having tape and
extensions in the first place so I'm
link those videos down below but let's
get into it so we're not gonna go
full-on in-depth about my hair history
here because like I said those videos
really go into it but long story short
so I've had dyed black hair since I was
about 13 14 I've just always felt so
much more myself with dark hair my hair
is naturally strawberry blonde I
literally couldn't tell you what I look
like with that hair color since I
haven't had it like that for a long time
besides what we'll get to anytime I try
and change my hair color I always go
back to this color dark hair is really
easy to dye yourself so I always just
colored my hair myself growing up my
hair was always super healthy super long
shiny soft both my parents are very
hairy have some good hair oh wow we have
some good hair jeans my mom has super
thick hair I definitely got her hair I
have a lot of hair naturally and it is
thick and it was very healthy and long
up until a couple years ago I never had
clip in extensions I never had tape and
extensions I never thought I'd have
either of those things because like I
said my hair was long it was pretty
thick I never really felt like I needed
more hair on my head up until gray
failed 2017 it actually might have
started in 2016 and I'm thinking about
it you can go back and watch those
videos but I tried to go gray from box
black dye of years like ten years at
that point twelve years I did not do it
myself I would not recommend that you do
yourself or that you do it at all unless
you're willing to space it out over like
a year a year and a half and do it very
slowly and healthily I documented a lot
of the process the different stages and
everything so I'm not gonna go into it
here but basically my hair got totally
totally destroyed fried ruined from the
first place that I went to basically my
hair turned into spaghetti it was not
manageable I couldn't do anything to it
wouldn't dry I wouldn't brush it it was
like completely dead hair that basically
just needed to be chopped off going from
black to that is a long very expensive
very damaging process I don't know if
I'm glad I did it I think that one of
the questions on Twitter in hindsight I
don't think it was worth all that time
money and dead hair and cutting but I do
think it would always be in the back of
my mind trying it if I didn't do it so I
probably would have done it at another
point now I have no desire to do that
I'm gonna be this color for a long time
I could see myself adding in some like
lighter highlights here and there but
there's no way anytime in the near
future I'm going anywhere back to that
so as I'm going through this whole
process of lightening my hair is getting
shorter and shorter and more damage and
more damage I'm gonna insert some photos
right here so you can see as I was doing
this and as I was getting in the light
blonde kind of brown range my hair was
friggin short it was above my shoulders
I basically had like a lob going on and
I just felt honestly like a soccer mom I
just did not feel good with that hair
color I wasn't into it but I knew it was
kind of part of the process they just
have to go through if you want to get to
that silver gray phase this long story
isn't turning very short but I feel like
this is kind of info that you guys need
but once my hair was in the gray range
to deal with the roots coming in where I
couldn't bleach it because my hair was
so damaged that if we bleach even my
roots it would have like fallen off
right here so the hair stylist decided
to kind of ombre my hair from what was
supposed to be like a dark grey into the
silver what ended up happening was that
my roots and up here basically turned
like essentially black and then it kind
of faded into the lighter silver which I
actually really liked how it looked it
just kind of reversed everything that my
hair had gone through because
it was basically back to black on the
top so in that same session to add that
length in to add in like the silver at
the tips we custom colored these fusion
extensions fusion extensions if you're
not aware are pricey so before that
actually I had tape ins from VP fashion
I was using just myself just to like get
me by basically and so I went from the
tape ins and then tried fusions with
that hombre situation and the fusion
extensions while I had them I did really
like there are definitely more cons to
the fusion extensions then tape ins and
I a hundred percent prefer tape ins and
would recommend tape ins to you over
fusions I don't know if the pricing is
like this everywhere but in Seattle not
a whole lot of people do extensions
because they're just not that popular
here so I think the people that do do
them can basically charge a premium
because you don't have a whole lot of
choices who to go to not only are they
insanely pricey it takes hours to put
them in in hours to take them out so the
whole process is extremely expensive
they are not comfortable at all it feels
like you have little beads in your head
so when you're sleeping I totally got
used to it so didn't really bother me
but now compared to tape ins it's like
there's it's not even a comparison I
could feel every little bead when I laid
on my head they're basically like
individual clamp things that they heat
and then they attach to your hair I'm
not a hair stylist obviously so I don't
know the correct terminology here I'm
just sharing my experience with this let
me find a tape in here I can't even see
mine really because mine are dark tape
but there's one right here so instead of
having this whole piece of tape or it's
like a chunk of hair they are basically
smaller hairs that attach to strands of
hair so depending on how much hair you
have and I have a lot of hair like I
said a lot of hair a lot of thick hair
you're basically putting hundreds of
these little beads into your head and
you have to do them every few months
because they start growing out and it
takes hours to also take them out the
whole process how they feel everything
the price I just would definitely go
with tape ins over fusion extensions
honestly can't remember why back then I
didn't do tape ins instead of fusions I
think that was just like what was
recommended to me I also feel like
fusions are so much more damaging
because they're attached to each
individual hair and when you unclamp
and like melt them off some of your hair
can fall out if it's really fragile and
damaged which mine was in the tape ins I
don't find to be damaging on my hair at
all so much less damaging because they
basically just sandwiched between a
really thin amount of your natural hair
and to get them off all they do is spray
it with some kind of like alcohol
removing kind of spray and then she kind
of like rubs between them and then it
comes off and my hair is totally fine so
it's basically just tape around your
actual hair so if you're debating
between fusions and tape ins I just
can't think of one benefit honestly of
fusions over tape ins so after the
fusions I decided to try the tape ins
and I kind of bounced around between
different colors and things I had like
blue hair at one point that I loved the
color she did an amazing job but I kind
of tried different tape and brands in
the conclusion that I found is that I
wanted someone to basically apply the
tape ins but I wanted to bring in my own
hair so something I really wish I knew I
wish I learned earlier on is find a hair
stylist that is willing to let you bring
in your own hair it's actually pretty
hard to find and I can totally
understand why a lot of them have brands
that they like to use and sometimes it's
easier with matching color if they do it
rather than you trying to find the right
color for your hair but if you have a
color like mine where it's pretty
friggin easy to match black hair is not
difficult to match you just go with the
darkest shade and every extension pretty
much then I would definitely recommend
that you bring in your own hair and find
a stylist who will let you do that it's
probably gonna be cheaper because you
can choose the hair that you want and
you can kind of figure out which brand
you like and just purchase your own hair
and then basically just bring it in and
have the stylist put it on for you so
that's what I do and that's what I've
been doing for the last year so I go to
Holly obadiah salon in Bellevue if
you're in the Seattle area so when I
started getting the tape ins about a
year ago my hair was above my shoulders
and since then my hair is now right here
I'm going to start a picture it's curled
into the extensions right now but my
natural hair is actually getting pretty
long here's my natural hair now so it's
grown how many inches is that like five
inches maybe six inches I think this
video is gonna be like an hour long if I
went into how I grew up my hair and
everything so let me know if you'd want
a separate video everything about how I
grew out my hair and the products I use
and stuff it has
grown a ton and I'm probably going to
only keep in the extensions for maybe
two more times just so my hair grows
probably like three or four more inches
so as far as the actual hair that I
bring into my stylist and that I use so
I've tried it for different brands I've
tried VP fashion Bombay hair glam
seamless or gleam seamless what's called
glam seamless which was the ones that
the blue ones that were put in by the
stylist and then these ones that I get
off of Amazon and actually my go-to ones
now are the ones that I get off of
Amazon the worst ones in my opinion
we're definitely at the glam seamless
those were horrible they tangled so easy
my hair got super dry feeling and they
just felt really fake like it felt like
wig hair almost I did not like those
ones at all if you're going for quality
like if you don't mind the price tag and
you just want really soft thick quality
tapings I would go with Bombay hair
those are beautiful and every stylist I
brought those into has felt them and
been like dang that is some good feeling
hair Bombay hair is really nice if
you're willing to splurge what you can
also do is mix something like bombay
hair with something like the other ones
I'm going to tell you so the Amazon ones
are actually my go twos right now for a
while I was mixing the Bombay with the
Amazon just so you couldn't see it as
much of a difference in quality of hair
since it was all mixed together and I
think that's a good way if you still
want the really good quality but you
don't want to pay like a shit-ton for
the Bombay ones I want to say the past
six months I've solely been using the
Amazon ones because they are super
affordable and they're not bad at all
they actually hold up really well so
just to give you a price comparison the
Amazon ones that I buy are $40 for 50
grams and Bombay ones are $120 for 50
grams so obviously huge price difference
there and when you're buying multiple
bundles that gets really pricey so I put
in four boxes into my hair about three
and a half to 4 boxes but keep in mind I
have very thick hair like I have a lot
of hair so most people are about two
bundles so like a hundred grams probably
won't need four boxes that's just what I
do so depending on how much hair you
need like if you just got two boxes the
Bombay ones that would be $280 worth of
hair
versus if you got two boxes of the
Amazon ones that would be $80 so
obviously a lot more cost-effective and
I actually find them to be pretty dang
good quality they obviously aren't as
good as the Bombay ones but for the
price and if you're just looking for
ones that are pretty reasonable and that
work and that don't look bad then I
would just say go with the Amazon one I
do use a hair mask on my extensions I
only wash my hair about once a week
honestly my hair does not get oily and I
just got off accutane so I'm still like
pretty dry I'll leave it on for about an
hour on dry hair you obviously don't
want to be putting it at the root on a
tape because that'll loosen up the tape
you just put it on the ends and I feel
like that keeps my extensions looking
good looking healthy looking shiny and
the cool thing about tape pins is that
you can actually reuse the hair so again
it just depends how well you maintain
them but for me I use my hair usually
about three different times which I get
my hair done about every two and a half
months when the tape starts growing out
it just depends on how quickly your hair
grows but for me I feel like that's a
good amount of time is two and a half
months so basically I can use the same
bundles of hair for about six to seven
months it isn't too bad if you look at
it like that and that is really cheap
for extensions if you're getting them
done at the salon usually it would cost
you a lot a lot more than that so this I
just find works really well for me I'm
happy with the price point I'm happy
with the quality and how it turns out
like I said don't get these Amazon ones
expecting that they're gonna be like the
softest best quality hair extensions
ever because if you want that get the
bombay ones but they work really well
for me and I do really like them so the
one thing that I would suggest though is
no matter what tape ins you get get the
tape from VP fashion they have the best
most intense hair extension tape ever I
do not have a single piece full out when
I use that tape and before I was using a
different tape and I literally would
have about three or four pieces fall out
in the span of about two and a half
months like before I went in and since I
switched back to the VP fashion tape
nothing falls out it is in there that
tape is super strong so just go on VP
fashion buy that tape and then bring
that to your stylist and have them use
that tape they Amazon extensions I get
our twenty inches long but she does cut
them and like blend them in to mesh with
your hair
and a good rule of thumb for how long
you want to go with your extensions and
again your stylist will do this for you
but is about double the length of your
natural hair is the max length you'd
want to go if you go any longer than
that it just looks too fake which is why
when my hair was here I didn't have my
extensions this long I had them to about
here if not it just doesn't blend and it
doesn't look the best just go less than
double your natural hair and also I
should say so I usually I like to color
my hair myself because like I said what
dark hair it's just super easy and then
you just save a bunch of money if you
just do it at home both the extensions
obviously you don't want to get right up
to the extension with the hair color cuz
that'll just like weaken the tape and
everything but I do dye my roots myself
in between I do it one time in between
every two and a half months so I guess I
do my roots maybe probably like six
weeks after I get my hair done and then
when I go in for her to do the tape in
she does the all-over color to get the
parts that I didn't get with the tape
ins but basically when I do my roots
I'll just do around my face my part and
then any areas I can get that don't
really touch the tape okay so let's go
on to Twitter I'm gonna answer some of
the questions from there because I think
there's a lot of basic ones that would
be good to get to talk about so
present-tense cat lady on twitter says
how do you wash your hair with the
extensions in so with the VP fashion
tape you actually you don't to be as
careful as you would with other tape
because like I said it just really stays
in there but I shampoo my hair normally
so I'll get the roots really good and
then to get in between the tape I'll
just kind of you can feel it where the
tape is so I have tape in extensions all
like all down here so I just kind of
lift up my hair and then I'll put
shampoo on and just kind of scrub
between the tape ends like this and then
I'll get the base really good and just
anywhere where you can get between the
tape ends I will say the one thing I
miss with not having any kind of
extensions in it's just like shampooing
your scalp really good whenever she's
shampooing my hair at the salon when the
tapings are out it literally feels like
heavenly but then conditioner I
definitely don't put the conditioner up
to the top you want to stay away from
the tape so conditioner all do all on my
normal hair up here and then I'll kind
of clip it up and then I'll just
condition my ends with the tape ins and
everything Daniela says does your hair
grow fast or has it been that long since
the gray hair I feel like my hair hasn't
grown a quarter the length years has
since this whole debacle so I'll touch
on that
in the next video if you guys want to
see that the products that I've been
using but my hair does grow really fast
naturally my nails and everything grow
really fast naturally so I definitely
think that's helped I didn't realize how
long actually my hair was this last time
I'll talk about what I've been doing
specifically in that video if you want
to see it Haley says do you get trims
regularly or no so I was getting regular
trims the first six months of going to
Halle just to get all of the super
damaged bleached hair off and it's
basically off now I have about half an
inch at the bottom that I'm gonna trim
next time that's damaged but besides
that all of this is new growth so it's
not damaged but when my hair was at its
healthiest like before the tape ins and
everything actually did not cut my hair
a whole lot which I know they're
supposed to like cut off the dead end so
it doesn't just keep splitting and stuff
but for me I found that my hair was the
strongest longest and healthiest when I
only got a trim like every eight months
so there's a few questions about if you
can color extensions or how that works
and the best easiest way is to get hair
that's already been colored because a
lot of hair you never know how it's
gonna turn out I don't know how many of
you were there when I had the total
extension filled with a certain salon
where my hair was like blonde and then
the extensions were blue it was it was
pretty bad so if you can find extensions
that just match your hair I would go
that but you definitely can get certain
extensions that you can color but again
it's gonna be way more expensive if you
have to have someone custom color your
extensions could always get platinum
blonde ones and then color it just make
sure that that exact hair that you're
getting is diable because a lot of
extensions you can't color best says can
you wear your hair in a ponytail or does
it look weird there are a few questions
like this about styling hair extensions
and stuff and it basically all depends
on how your hairstylist positions them
so Holly and I kind of figured it out
there trial and error what works best
for me one of my big things is that I
want to be able to put my hair behind my
ears because when I'm working in stuff I
hate having hair in my face and I just
like to tuck my hair behind my ears and
then my other thing is that I want to be
able to put my hair in a ponytail and
when I do I don't want you to see any
tape on the sides what they can do is
position the tape differently depending
on what you want so some hairstyles
will like ankle the tape right here so
it'll go kind of straight back if that
makes sense versus having it stick out
the side and as your hairstylist is
putting them in can kind of pull it back
like this and check to make sure that as
they're doing it nothing's gonna be
poking out but I do wear my hair in low
ponytails I also wear it in high bun so
the other cool thing is that especially
if you have dark hair you can get
extensions like this where the tape
isn't super noticeable at all you
actually feel like I can do so much more
with my hair since it's at least long
than I could when I didn't have
extensions in because when it's short
there's not a whole lot you can do you
have to style it alright so a lot of
people asked how to brush without
hitting the tape when you have fusions I
definitely would recommend a loop brush
you can get it on Amazon I cannot find
mine I'm pretty sure it's in a suitcase
somewhere cuz I bring that one when I'm
traveling usually if you have tape and
extensions it doesn't matter as much
because you're not gonna be brushing
over the tape you're just gonna go right
below the tape to brush and for that my
favorite brush I found is the wet brush
I don't like this actually in the shower
because I don't feel like it detangles
very well on my hair I know a lot of
people love it for detangling but for me
I like using just a normal brush in the
shower when my hair has conditioner in
it I'll brush it out but this brush is
great for just everyday use and you
definitely need to brush out your tape
and extensions or else you're gonna get
dreads at the base it's called like
getting matting so if you don't brush
your extensions I am pretty bad I don't
brush them every day but I definitely
brush them every few days and I'll just
go right up to the extension and kind of
brush it out I don't wanna do it right
now I've curls in make sure you don't
have any knots right at the tape and the
wet brush works really well for that for
me on dry hair and you can kind of like
brush over it I just don't I usually
just section off my hair and I'll brush
my natural hair and the bottoms and
stuff and then I'll go up to the tape
and kind of come it out that's making a
sound like they're high maintenance but
honestly it tape ins are so low
maintenance compared to like clippings
or anything Erica says why did you
choose taping over clipping extensions
so much less time so much lower
maintenance you don't have to spend any
time throughout the day putting them in
they're just always in I could not do
clip ins there's no way I would sit
around clip those in every day tape ins
are so easy and so low maintenance it
really is just like brushing them and
keep
then maintained like you would with your
normal hair so I don't find them to be
high maintenance at all Christa asked
are the tape and super damaging I've
been toying with the idea of extensions
but my hair isn't exactly the healthiest
and I worry about damaging it even more
I'm not a hair service but like I said I
feel like they're the least damaging and
I also feel like it's almost helped my
hair grow because I'm not heat styling
my actual hair as much and I'm not heat
styling at all if I don't need to like
if I just want to throw my hair back in
a bun or ponytail especially when it was
really damaged like when I was trying to
heal my hair I was trying not to heat
style it that much so with the
extensions because you have that length
there you could just throw it up into a
bun so if you have damaged hair I almost
feel like it's a really good idea
because then you won't be tempted to
have to like style your damaged hair so
a few questions about pricing and I
already went over the price of the
actual extensions which is a big part of
it but also it obviously costs for the
hairstylist to take them out and install
them and everything it's really hard to
give an actual price because it just
depends on everything it depends on how
much hair you have depends on if they're
custom coloring it depends on if you
bring in your own hair and everything
but I would say low-end if you bring in
your own hair probably like 400 to
install it that's like a that's like
really low if you have them do
everything from what I found in Seattle
it's like a thousand and up if they're
doing everything and if it's custom
color that's where it gets really
expensive so huge range there is call
around and see what different salons
around you charge but it's obviously not
cheap and it's not a permanent thing for
me this is like just to keep in well my
hair is getting back to how it was me
it's totally worth it because I just
feel like so much more myself and I have
long dark hair and I really like it and
I haven't had any kind of bad
experiences with the taping so I think
it's worth it but obviously it depends
on your budget what you're willing to
spend on your hair and also I kind of
think of it as four years like ten or
twelve years I did not have anyone else
touch my hair so I saved so much money
that's the way I'm looking at it I saved
so much money over the years by me just
doing it myself that I'm like okay I can
splurge a little for the short period of
time I'm trying to think what else I
feel like that's pretty much everything
I would just say do your research for
sure with this
Lon's because i have had some very not
pleasant salon experiences like some
nightmare ones find someone who knows
what they're doing and isn't going to
fry off all of your hair so you don't
have to go through all this but overall
i am super happy with my kind of routine
right now going to Hollie get an Amazon
extensions this color I'll put a few
different coloring colorings colors that
I use down below on my roots that I use
I like a blue-black dye and I have one
that I recently tried that I really like
it's like more blue than the others
usually are
I do use box die for my roots don't kill
me hairstylist I don't know like I said
I used it for years like 10 years and my
hair was really healthy and totally fine
until I tried to go light so as long as
you think you're gonna be a certain
color for a long time I haven't had any
bad experiences with box dye so I think
that's everything I can think of that
you guys would need to know if you have
any specific questions leave them down
below and maybe I can answer any of
those in the hair growth video if you
guys want to see that I hope you guys
found this video helpful if you did make
sure you give it a thumbs up I believe
everything I talked about linked down
