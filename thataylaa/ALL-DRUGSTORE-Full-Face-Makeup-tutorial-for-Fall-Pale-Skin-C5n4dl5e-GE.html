all drugstore full face makeup tutorial
and we starting out with foundation the
Rimmel 25 our lasting foundation is
frickin amazeballs the shade is light
enough for me it gives really good
coverage sorry about the brightness here
I turn it down in a second I do think
that something this foundation might
break me out so if you have sensitive
acne prone skin just be aware of that I
did just put out my top foundations for
pale skin video and a lot of those
products mentioned were drugstore
filling that down below next we're going
to go in with a concealer just to
brighten up the under eyes and cover any
spots that need extra covering up so I'm
just going in under the eyes this is the
Maybelline fit me concealer it's not in
the lightest shade all the product info
will be linked down below so you can
check out each product I'm not taking
any extra concealer but whatever is left
over on my finger I'm just going over
some chin spots and in the acne scarring
now we're going to go in with my Holy
Grail Physicians Formula a translucent
setting powder and we're just putting
this under the eyes I actually like
using a bigger brush to do this I just
feel like it gives better coverage but
whatever floats your boat I really love
the finish of this foundation it's super
nice and dewy but if you're not about
that duty life you can set it with a
mattifying powder or if you just get
oily throughout the day I'm going to
skip that step and just go in for
bronzer this is the makeup revolution
trio you can get this brand at Ulta now
which is freaking off
I used to have to order them online from
Europe so I'm just contouring and it all
is in my cheeks this is a warmer bronzer
and then we're going to use that same
blush palette and going with the
highlight shade since I found this video
I've been wearing this highlight every
day it is beautiful it's a super nice
Sheen to the cheekbone I'm gonna go in
with that same quad trio thing and use
the blush in here on a stippling brush
and just blend this on the apples of
your cheeks the next step I always do
after face is that going with my
favorite setting spray by L'Oreal and
this is me telling that you need this in
your life it is amazing it actually
makes your makeup stay on longer and
this is better than the urban decay one
in my opinion and Scandinavia it's the
best don't forget to hydrate ladies now
we're going to go in and prime the eyes
I attempted to use one of my Maybelline
cream eyeshadows that was thoroughly
dried up probably because it was like
three years old good choices even better
choices I decided to spray my setting
spray in here which kind of worked if
you have eye drops you can try mixing
those in if you have a dry product but
this one was just beyond say thing the
hard candy eye primer is also great you
can get that from Walmart now we're just
going to go in with this chocolate bar
palette by like a revolution again they
have really awesome eyeshadow palettes
and I'm just taking that Shea
and blending it into the crease whatever
product is left over I just kind of like
to blend downwards just so we don't have
any super harsh lines and be taking my
finger using this light brown shimmery
yeah light brown our leo says Orson put
this all over the lid I like to apply
lid shadows with my finger I just feel
like it always gives better pigmentation
once you have your lid shade on we're
going to be going in with this warm
Brown kind of lumpy ish shade and I'm
just blending this on the outer third to
start with a bigger kind of fluffy brush
and then this is just going to help
create some definition on the arc
did anyone hear that cough in the song
what was that I'm using a setting spray
to wet one of the eyeshadows in this
palette I'm just going on with the
lightest gold shimmery shade and putting
this on the inner corner of the eye you
can use that trick with any eyeshadow
that you own it just helps it look a lot
more shimmery and exciting I'm bringing
that same color down onto the bottom and
then this next step is something that's
super simple and I feel like it just
helps bring any look together we're just
blending this taupe kind of shade on the
bottom lashline you can see it just
connects the top eyeshadow with the
bottom my camera overheated what's new
but we just went in with a water line
eyeliner on the waterline I just said
waterline like three times now we're
going in with my favorite Physicians
Formula I booster liquid liner this is
just kind of a step by step on how I
create my winged liner I always cut this
part out in my shadow insurance videos
so hopefully this helps you guys winged
eyeliner is just a lot of practice so I
would suggest doing it at night before
you shower practice those wings ladies
if it looks crappy you can take it off
anyways I'm going back in with the
highlighter that we used on our
cheekbones and just applying this on the
bridge of my nose and Cupid's bow before
I apply false lashes I just put on any
mascara just a super thin quick coat
make sure that mascara is dry before you
start popping on false lashes because it
can get real messy real fast you always
want to measure the lashes if it's a new
pair against your eye before you glue
them on just to make sure they fit I
have a whole video that goes in depth
about how I apply false lashes so I'll
link that down below my biggest tip is
waiting until the blue is already tacky
so it's not sliding around on your
eyeball I like to start on the outer
corner and kind of work my way inwards
some people like to use tweezers to
apply them I just feel like my fingers
have the best control but it's up to you
I'm just using my liquid eyeliner again
to cover up that band we've done make
No lash glue picking through and then
I'm going to go in with some mascara to
blend top lashes with my false lashes
then we're also going to go in with some
bottom mascara as well
we're going to be going with a matte
berry lip today I feel like the red lip
or a nude lip would also lip it with
this look starting taking a colourpop
lip liner don't really know what's going
on here but we're going to roll with it
it worked out
after a lipliner we're going to go in
with my current favorite Milani amore
matte lip creams these are frickin
amazeballs you can get them at Fred
Meyer CVS Rite Aid I've only found them
in one place and I had to go on a
frickin manhunt to find two shades but
this shade is beautiful this is embrace
and it's the perfect very matte I feel
like this will be great in the fall
they're long lasting they don't feel
drying on the lips you need them this is
the end of this look if you guys liked
this video make sure you give it a
thumbs up so I know if you like double
chins give it a thumbs up so I know love
you guys thanks for watching and see on
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
