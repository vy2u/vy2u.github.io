talking all about my favorite
highlighters I don't know how I've never
done this video on my channel but it
felt like a good time I have a mix of
drugstore in high-end I actually have
about three high-end highlighters and
the rest are drugstore so so the most
part these are all super affordable my
postmates should be here in like 20
minutes I'm freaking starving I started
eating a doughnut for lunch
and then realized I'm an adult I should
probably not be eating donuts for lunch
I've tried most of the really popular
highlighters like the oaf Rebecca all
those and these ones I just always go
back to I just find that they last the
best on my skin they look the nicest
these ones are just my favorites so not
really going in any specific order I'm
gonna have all of them linked down below
along with my kind of to go to
highlighter brushes these are my go to
Holy Grail never let me down
highlighters so I'm gonna start out with
one that is probably my most reach for
out of all these just because it can go
with so many different looks I can make
it natural-looking I can make it more
intense and build it up and that's the
elf illuminating palette you guys have
probably heard me talk about all these
at some point actually yeah you
definitely have but this one I feel like
I always rave about pretty much the only
shade I use in here is this light one it
almost has a little bit of a yellow tone
to it there's something about it that
just brightens up your face really
beautifully you don't like really
powdery highlights you won't like this
this definitely has a ton of kick up and
I wish it was a little bit less powdery
but the way that it sits on my skin and
looks on my face is just stunning I do
have a lot of texture on my skin a lot
of highlighters will emphasize my
texture this is one that does not do
that so if you have really large pores
right here or it's just hard for you to
find the highlighter that doesn't I
would say give this one a go this is
super affordable itself doesn't say but
this is the elf illuminating palette you
can get this at Target or online this
next one is definitely one of the more
boom in-your-face intense kind of
highlighters which I actually don't
usually gravitate towards just because
those are the ones that emphasize my
texture the most I would say this level
of Ty Lee is about as intense as I go
I'm not into the look where it looks
like a stripe of eyeshadow on your cheek
totally fine if you are that's the fun
part about makeup there are no rules do
you go for it but for me I personally
like my highlight to look a little bit
more blended and just natural so Jake at
youth low girl in Bella Rose definitely
one that kind of borders that for me
this one you can make look very intense
and you can get that look but it doesn't
have that textures I love the tone of
this
has more of a pink tone to it it's
beautiful as an inner corner highlight
it's what I have on my eyes right now I
have tried the other shades of the you
glow girl highlighters which I don't
like this is the only shade I'm
recommending Bella Rose I find the other
ones are much more textured if you've
been following my channel for a while
you know this one is come in these are
the essence shadows in snowflake 0 1 &amp;amp; 0
8 apricot ax I reached for zero one
snowflake over apricot I just wanted to
mention this one in case you have a
little bit dark over skin tone this
thing is now looking hard to find in the
u.s. this eye shadow used to be $1.99 on
Ulta they actually stopped carrying it
and now it's really hard to find in the
u.s. if you have a Fred Meyer in your
area they might still carry this or a
Ulta and stores but online Ulta
definitely isn't carried anymore when I
look for eyeshadows that can be used as
highlighters I look for a really soft
kind of buttery formula that isn't again
going to emphasize the texture and
that's definitely what this is it's just
beautiful and it's a couple bucks you
can't go wrong so this is one I think
I've mentioned before but I don't think
I've fully talked about and this one
kind of surprised me this is I polished
choice this is their blush it on contour
palette so you actually get four blushes
in here to contour slash bronzer shade
and then this highlight shade this looks
so not exciting in the pan at all it
looks like nothing special but it's one
of those products that when you put it
on your face it's gorgeous it looks
completely different than in the pan it
has a really nice soft buttery formula
and I like to reach for this one when I
want a super natural highlight either on
days where I'm not wearing foundation
sometimes I'll just put on I actually
have a sitting right here which this is
like literally totally empty now this is
the Maybelline instant age rime but
sometimes I'll put this on just my acne
spots and then just put on a little bit
of a really natural highlight and they
either reach for this one or the next
one I'm going to talk about actually
really like the bronzer shade in here as
well the blushes are fine they're a bit
pigmented for what I like a highlighter
and bronzer shade in here are really
nice so in the same subtle category is
the hourglass ambient light ethereal
light powder I just have a little
travel-size but this is their lightest
one that they make testing these look
way more glowy on certain people but on
me I know if it's just a shade or what
but it looks really natural and very
subtle you almost can't see this you
really have to layer it up when you
swatch this it almost doesn't look like
a highlighter you only see it when it
hits the light a certain way this is
another one I reach for when I'm doing
supernatural makeup maybe my foundation
is already really
we andouille so I just want a more
natural highlighter you're only going to
buy one product out of all these I'm
mentioning I would say you got to go
with this one these are the Physicians
Formula shimmer brick I still you know
these are called shimmer bricks or
strips who knows okay they're shimmer
strips so I love both of these these are
just different shades this is the warm
nude shade and then this is the natural
nude if you're around my skin tone or
lighter I would go with the natural nude
because there's a full-on white
highlight in this one if you're a little
bit darker I would go with the warm nude
so this is a highlighter I have on my
cheeks right now so you can see what it
looks like there are no words for this
one this is so stunning these are
beautiful with eyeshadows this is great
to travel with because you have a
highlighter and eyeshadow and one should
also mix these darker kind of pinky
brown shades in here and use it as like
a blush topper you just have so many
uses and I think are one of the best
products ever at the drugstore if you
haven't picked this up yet this is not a
drill you need these in your life so I'm
editing this back right now and realized
I forgot to mention one of my favorite
highlighters of all time don't ask me
how it was sitting on my table and I was
filming but this is the makeup
revolution goddess of love highlight
this is the goddess of face shade ins
almost like this champagne with a little
bit of pink in it that's more champagne
than pink when it's on your face it's
what I would say out of all of them has
a most sheen to it where it looks more
wet as opposed to like a shimmering
highlight just what I love that is my
ideal highlighter this one I have a ton
of videos wearing this if you want to
see how it looks on my skin you can just
search it again but absolutely love this
super affordable if you've been watching
me for a while this is another one that
you definitely heard me talk about but
this is the it cosmetics my sculpted
face palette they recently redid the
packaging on this so I have the older
version but this is another one of those
products that looks like nothing
exciting in the pan it just looks like a
light pink kind of powder when you put
this on your face this one actually is
pretty intense has almost a pink purpley
white color to it and if you can tell by
all these I usually go for either white
or pink toned highlighters I'm not super
into the gold or yellows just because of
my skin tone I find that those ones look
a little bit off feel like I don't have
a whole lot of variation and description
on all these because they're all
highlighters but this one just sits
really nicely on my skin I also love
this contour shade right here I also use
all the brown shades in here as
eyeshadows so it's just a really
versatile palette for me I've had it for
years and I still
myself reaching for it this one I
recently warned mentioned this is the
etude house secret beam highlighter I
think I use this in a foundation Friday
or something but I said in that video
that this one is underrated and it
totally is it reminds me of a better
version of the Laura Geller one that
looks exactly like this which I actually
have this one I like 50 times better
than the Laura Geller for sure this is
under 10 bucks on Amazon this one I just
like to blend all the colors together
and you get really pretty again kind of
pinky white tone highlighter cafe M has
arrived what was I saying the way this
one looks reminds me a lot of it
cosmetics my sculpture face fellas you
could probably go with one or the other
it want to see how any of these looks on
my skin you can just type into YouTube
the Tayla and the name of the product
and in any video that I have using that
specific product will come up to me
swatches of highlighters don't really do
them justice for a couple of reasons
you're putting it on your bare skin so
it doesn't have as much to stick to when
you put highlight on bare skin versus on
top of foundation I think it looks way
better on top of foundation typically
this one can be used for a lot of
different skin tones because you have
this darker gold shade in here you have
a white and is also a light pink this is
a city color highlight trio in the shade
collection one if you like intense
highlighters I would say the intensity
of this is similar to the Jake at Bella
Rose but either of these are beautiful
sometimes I'll mix these two I was going
through my collection a few days ago
this is one that I totally forgot about
I used to freaking love this thing this
used to be one of my most reached for
this is a makeup revolution ultra
brightening contour kit in ultra fair
c01 this middle shade right here almost
looks like it would be too dark it's
like a rose gold kind of color there's
something about the formula of this that
is just so stunning how many times up we
said stunning looks another word I can
use set all the adjectives when I pick
it up on my finger it looks really
opaque it feels really soft there's not
a whole lot of kick up or anything this
I feel like would be a beautiful one for
weddings or prom it just has that really
Lois intense but not textured look to it
the shade I also really like as like a
blush topper it's a little bit too
intense just wear as a blush alone it
almost looks like NARS orgasm but on
crack the last one I want to share with
you guys you've probably all heard about
but this is the Mac mineralized
skinfinish in lightscapade over the
years this one just has never done me
wrong it always looks great mine is a
little bit janky the plastics like
fallen out I got the self of glam bought
these ones when I'm wearing just a
concealer looks very natural almost like
the hourglass ambient lighting
but when I put this on on top of
foundation definitely give them more of
a highlight if you have fair skin this
is a really versatile highlight you can
wear this for literally any look and it
always looks great and I have 50 layers
