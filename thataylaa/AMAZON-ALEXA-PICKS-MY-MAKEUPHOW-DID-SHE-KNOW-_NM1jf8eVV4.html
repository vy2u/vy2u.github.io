ordering my makeup 2018 man this is the
Amazon echo dot I have never owned an
Amazon echo Alexa anything I am actually
pretty anti Alexa not gonna lie she just
kind of freaks me out a little bit but I
thought it would be interesting to see a
if Alexa can order me makeup and also
what she chooses also do we refer to
Alexa as if she I don't even know I'm
gonna LexA knew it I don't know so I'm
gonna have Alexa choose five different
makeup products for me off of Amazon

I did was plug it in and I started
reading the frigging manual and she just
started talking look at her she already
owns this place
oh I need the app alright so while I'm
getting this thing set up I got this
idea from one of you guys so I'm gonna
pop in the comment right here but I just
thought this would be such a fun video
by the way I just filmed a shadow much
from this video on this looks if you
want to see that it's already live by
the time you guys are seeing this so
link it down below you've connected to
echo dot o it's H cute I'm a little
scared little scared Alexa are you okay
I'm good I hope you're doing well too
Alexa do you like shopping Alexa I don't
have an opinion on that Alexa do you
like Sephora or Ulta I don't have an
opinion on that well get one Alexa is
the sky blue the sky is blue because the
molecules of the atmosphere all right
are you ready to go shopping on Amazon

mind okay definitely thought she was
gonna give me a next step she ordered it
it is arriving Thursday I was not
expecting that to just go through so
we're gonna have Amazon order me five
different makeup items I have no idea
what the pricing is gonna be like we're
just gonna go with whatever she picks so
it could be a super pricey product it
could be a drugstore price product like
the l'oreal one Thank You Alexa but here

orders me to try out oh god she just
went on so let's do four more products

I found Burt's Bees goodness glow
g-shock whatever liquid based on your
order history based on your order
history
I found based on your order history of
when I played our games okay so she
seems to be only wanting to go through
my already purchased items I have no
idea why it was so easy to order the
mascara when I wasn't even really
thinking that was gonna go through a
trying but now it seems like she's only
getting my past
Amazon history instead of shopping for
new things so I'm trying to think how
else I can ward this so we're gonna get
new search results browse eyeshadow on
Amazon I couldn't find a list called eye
shadow on Amazon Alexa search eyeshadow

dot received an important update and
must be start are you getting better at
shopping or what according to google
Alexa can order basically anything
Amazon Prime eligible that sold her
fulfilled by Amazon directly Alexa can
draw on your existing order history on
Amazon yeah I think we've established
that it says that she can also order new
products if it's something new Alexa
will suggest an Amazon choice product
that meets the description okay so
theoretically I should be able to order
new products Alexa order a lipstick from
prime now I don't understand sorry the

brunette would you like to buy it
yes order placed Wow okay that was quite
the experience I just went into my
Amazon now thing it looks like the
shades are somehow correct I have no
idea how they knew that or if it was
just totally random and I got lucky
they're gonna deliver it through prime
now so prime now is almost like post
mates you just it delivers the same day
if you're in certain cities so that will
be here today but I'm gonna come back
and fill in the makeup part of this
video tomorrow so we'll see how Alexa
did I feel like with the ordering part
of this there are definitely some things
they need to work on it seemed like she
didn't understand a lot of basic
commands about just ordering new things
or not ordering past projects like
reorders and for some reason it only
worked with the prime now not just the
regular Amazon app because I think it
didn't have the option to go through my
past orders since I haven't ordered
anything in those categories on prime
now before I guess I ended up ordering 7
products as I have one mascara coming
from regular Amazon and the six makeup
products coming from Amazon Prime now so
I will be back once I have the makeup in
my hands
alright so it's now a couple days later
I've got the goods here so I have no
idea no idea how Alexa knew the shade
yeah I don't know how they would connect
my order history through like Ulta or
Walmart what
Amazon but you know I never know who
watched the Facebook trials maybe it was
looking at my past orders and kind of
guessing I've no clue but she got the
shade 112 natural ivory which is my
closest shade match in Maybelline fit me
I've never ordered Maybelline fit me off
the Amazon so that's a little weird I
actually already own a few of these
items but since it was part of the video
I just went ahead and bought them
through Amazon so this isn't like a
review or first impression or anything
on actual product so I'm just gonna use
products do a full makeup look and kind
of make em work I want so I'm actually
gonna mix the Maybelline with the dewy
and smooth one because I like the doing
smooth version a lot better than the
matte and poreless this one looks tragic
on my skin both when I had oily skin and
now drier skin so I'm just doing about
half half and I'm gonna mix these I also
painted my nails between the last time
you guys saw me you know I actually love
this color I find it really hard to find
a light pink for fair skin that actually
looks like light pink and you can like
see it against your skin I always leave
my nail polish and everything anything
I'm wearing down below in the
description box
definitely so far looks better than the
matte and poreless on its own I'm just
gonna smooth out my forehead with a
sponge just went literally right in my
eyeball I probably look hella bloodshot
right now cuz this one has something in
it I just poked the crap out of this I
was a sponge so Alexa ordered me the NYX
HD studio concealer in the shade fair
we'll actually see how the shade is
because I'm usually the shade porcelain
in this one I haven't used this
concealer in a long time I don't love
this concealer on its own but I do like
the lavender one for mixing in if you
need to lighten a concealer at least I
got a new shade though oh yeah that
looks pretty crappy I don't get great
coverage of this concealer and also
creases a crap ton on me I'm setting my
under eyes using a mix of my to go to
powders lately the may chair and then
the Physicians Formula one I always use
by the way in the last two days I have
not attempted to use Alexa I don't even
know she's on right now I feel like
she's just on all the time I thought I
ordered a brow product oh hell yeah here
it is
so we have the brow stylist definer in
the shade brunette again got my
right alright let's try out this brow
product I feel like I've used this I
don't remember what I think of it though
this is one of those brow products that
does not have that grip to it that I
usually like gives you like the blurry
kind of look rather than like defined
hairs I feel like that shade is a tiny
bit light
I'm gonna take my a Owego brow this is a
dollar brow product from shop miss a I
just did a whole video trying out a
bunch of stuff from there and this one
I've been using almost everyday since
then I really like it it just feels a
bit dry but other than that like the
shade and just the way it holds my brows
in place I really like couple things
came in bubble wrap but only like two of
the things not the eyeshadow palette or
anything but this is the Physicians
Formula butter bronzer in the shade
bronzer again also weird because this
actually isn't the lightest shade in
this it's the shade up but this is the
shade that I like creeping out one of my
go-to bronzers it smells like heaven
really smells like summer I'm so ready
just blending it out this is a sigma at
15 brush duo-fiber
so this blush I actually discovered
through my whole foods makeup video this
is the mineral fusion blush in the shade
pale and I've been reaching for this a
lot and it's a really pretty just like
natural looking blush shade for my skin
tone or highlight I'm gonna take the
NARS fort-de-france
here's what it looks like these
highlighters are beautiful you're like I
need some extra glow today so I'm gonna
douse my face in some setting spray I'm
gonna use mac fix+
and just go to town here really need to
figure out a way to hang that thing
better than tape really can transform
your skin like look how much do your and
better that looks now so we're gonna
prime my eyes with my usual Mac Paint
Pot so the eye shadow palette Alexa
ordered me was the Maybelline the nudes
palette I get so confused by all the
different nudes I feel like they have 25
different versions of these palettes now
I'm pretty sure I've tried this at some
point but I haven't used this one in a
long time either so I'm gonna start out
with this matte taupe shade right here
and put that into the crease this light
taupe you kind of shade right here looks
really pretty so I'm gonna take that on
my finger feels a little bit dry ooh
that's
good oh man that has like barely any
pigment do it
I'm trying this shade instead right here
he's feel very dry
I'm just really building this up with my
finger to get some kind of payoff and
going with the shade right here in the
corner cool tone brown I'm just gonna
kind of pack it into the outer V first
and then I'll go and blend it out I'm
gonna go back in with that first
blending brush and just blend these
edges out so that is getting so patchy
just kind of going back in and adding
I'm gonna try to wet my brush and go
back in with that first shade because I
really want something to kind of pop on
the lid this one there's my P shadow
that needs to be wet man
alright I don't like that shade oh let's
try this lightest shade maybe this one's
better also looks pretty sheer but looks
a little bit better okay this isn't no
this is a hard pass I'm just gonna run
with this whole super smoky thing and
going with this pure midnight diamond
and then blend it out and Pat it in
that's saving the day I'm gonna go with
the black eyeliner for my waterline now
I'm gonna go back in with the palette
and take the black in here I'm gonna
just put that right underneath the
eyeliner when I blend that out with the
shade that I put in the outer V so I
just put on some liquid liner I use my
Physicians Formula
eye booster and then I just went in with
a smaller brush and kind of blended out
the edges so the line where the gray was
wasn't as harsh right towards the inner
part of my eye as an inner corner
highlight I'm gonna take this AOA baked
highlighter in the shade allure there we
go that's like the icy shade I was
looking for this is the mascara that
Alexa ordered me this is L'Oreal
voluminous carbon black mascara it
doesn't look like this is the waterproof
version but when I first started YouTube
actually this was one of my favorite
mascaras I think I got this
recommendation from I heart makeup 92
back in the day but I'm excited to use
this again because I haven't used this
in so long and I did used to really
enjoy this mascara I remember I used to
really like layering it too with other
mascaras it's almost more like
lengthening and separating than I
remember going for a second layer here
oh yeah now we're getting some volume I
don't think I'm gonna do false lashes
today so I might even go in for a third
layer really get wild
I play not as luminous as my Too Faced
better than sex but I feel like I could
find a combo layering this that I would
really like I almost feel like I used to
like this one a little bit more dried
out so I think I would like it
maybe after like a week or two of having
this out and I'm gonna go with my normal
mascara for my bottom lashes wet and
wild mag length and then we'll be moving
on to lips but normally if I had and I
look like this going on like more of a
smoky eye I'm probably pear and I look
like this with more of like a nude calm
lip but Alexa ordre des a red ravishing
Rose by elf this is the moisturizing
lipstick I think I'm gonna need to look
liner so let me grab one of those I'm
gonna try this la girl one in the shade
blushing this might be a tiny bit light
but we'll see
oh this almost looks this looks pretty
pink let me try and get more red one
said I'm gonna take Mac brick right now
that shade looks pretty similar
it almost looks more pink okay we're not
taking that one either temperature
number three we're gonna try the Catrice
ultimate stay
in the shade relight my fire this one is
definitely looks like more like a true
red okay now it's gone with this elf
lipstick this shade looks really pretty
looks promising
it smells so good it was really nice and
moisturizing like I said I would
probably not wear it with a look like
this I think the nude lip would look a
lot better right now but blame Alexa so
my Amazon bag is now empty so overall I
would definitely pass on the eyeshadow
palette but as far as the shades and
stuff and just the products in selection
that she picked I think she'd somehow
did fairly decent the shade thing is
throwing me off far as the whole
ordering process through Amazon Alexa I
feel like it could definitely use some
work
reordering versus ordering new products
so I definitely think that could be
fine-tuned a little bit but I hope you
