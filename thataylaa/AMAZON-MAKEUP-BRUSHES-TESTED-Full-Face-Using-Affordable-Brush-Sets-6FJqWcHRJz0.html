in my mouth right now
all right so today I'll be testing out
two different brush sets I got off of
Amazon both of these sets retail for
under 12 bucks which is amazeballs
Amazon prices always fluctuate but right
now both of them are under 12 bucks
which means each brush in this set is
under $1 so I'm doing a full face look
testing out these testing out these
brush sets seeing if they're worth it
seeing if one is better than the other
I'm actually pretty impressed that I got
all of these in my hand right now
brushes are something to me that can
definitely be worth the investment and I
know beauty people on the internet
always say that but it is true I've
Sigma brushes that I've had for 6 years
now that are still going strong at the
same time I have elf brushes that I've
also had 4 years and those are a few
bucks
I believe my kind of go-to makeup
brushes also listed down below so you
can see what I usually use but we're
going to putting these guys to the test
so if you're excited for this video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up
let's jump into it okay clip back the
hair guys I've only had half a cup of
coffee today I need to get the one
clearly breaking out pretty bad down
here I started using aloe vera that's
supposed to help with acne but I think
it's been breaking me out so I prime my
face no I'm actually going to use a
different primer than usual this is the
number 7 airbrush away primer okay just
doing a video and I liked it I was kind
of like a lotion feel when it goes on
but then just absorbs into your skin and
gives you the feel of like a silicone
primer almost here are my two amazon
brushes I'm going to undo these so they
both come in very secure packaging this
one is the eMac design 12 piece brush
set retails for 1099 so that's amazing
that's lesson dollar for each brush whoa
these are very very small handles it's
that I think I chose because if azuki's
on here it looks promising it looks like
there are some nice powder brushes and
just overall like face brushes and then
I think this next set I chose because
there's more kind of precision eye
brushes things like that so in this next
set you actually get a pretty nice case
with it too if you don't have anywhere
to store your makeup brushes you could
just keep them in here for traveling
this one retails for $16 free same-day
shipping but you get 18 pieces so again
less than a dollar a brush both of these
are synthetic brush shares if you are
going to be ordering brushes on like
eBay or Amazon definitely stay away from
like the goat tears those are typically
more Scratchy
alright all of them are undone my first
thought is that both of these feel very
soft bristles on both feels super soft
she's going to feel a little bit heavier
a little bit
their quality of these two a little bit
light and kind of cheap plastic e since
this is a first impression obviously
we're not gonna be able to see how the
brush is washed cut the glue holds up a
lot of time so cheaper brushes you can
have the handles breaking off and things
like that so for foundation I think when
you use a cosmetics CC cream usually
like the illumination one but I'm
completely out of it so I'm using this
guy up this is in the shade fair and I
usually have to mix this one I've been
getting a little bit of color so I don't
know this might match I know how this
one performs and this one I can
typically apply with different kind of
foundation brushes we're just going to
call this one the gold set and we'll
call this the wood set as far as the
gold set I'm thinking this is what they
want you to apply your foundation with I
hate these kind of brushes for applying
foundation you're basically just like
painting it on and kind of smearing it
around doesn't actually blend it in in
this set it doesn't really look like
there's a solid foundation brush these
are all very flimsy and these look more
like powder or like blush brushes to me
so in the wood set you have a few
options you have two kibou keys here
this is like a mini sized one one of
these almost looks like it could be used
for like safe food feels nice the
smaller one feels a little bit more
flimsy so I'm going to hold off on this
one for foundation I usually like more
firm foundation brush that's when I get
the best coverage you also have this
like domed kabuki brush which to be
really nice for powder oh oh no this
also feels like it's work they look like
they're going to be flimsier than they
are it actually has some nice firm is to
it this brush I'm really excited about
for like blush and bronzer whoo that
looks like it'll be really nice I think
I'm going to go in with this longer
handled brush for foundation I'm going
to use this to apply it to my face
because why not it's here I'm probably
going to have to do some spot concealing
today since mask man's out to party and
cap a little bit more on the brush just
kind of codecs that's what I usually do
I usually like to Pat in my foundation
versus full-on blend but if you're a
blender I could see this working really
well because it does have some nice like
a bend to it I don't know why I'm like
doing half my face right now I feel like
it's a foundation Friday yeah if you
tried to do this brush with your whole
face see it just would have to go in
with your hands or something to blend
this is the first day in like three days
that I'm out of bed functioning so it
feels good to be alive today filming so
that worked totally good to blend out
foundation I'm all out of my Maybelline
so age rewind so it's not concealed I'm
just going to use NARS vanilla let's
brush drawing is for this this looks
like a really nice concealer brush also
you could use this to like carve out
your brows or to apply shadow to your
lid I said it looks like there's also
concealer brush but this one is a bit
bigger I'm going to use this one for the
face concealer and then we can use this
for my brows but you could definitely
get away with either one for both those
things or under eye concealer actually
want to try out a new concealer this is
the NARS soft matte complete concealer
in the shade vanilla this is their new
pot concealer I've only tried this one
time like no makeup on just playing
around with it right when I got it in
the mail I haven't put this on over
foundation or anything yet so I'm not
really sure what I think of it yet it
looks like there's a nice concealer
brush in here time is similar to my
morphe G 38 except it's a little bit
longer and a tiny bit more domed but I
think it has the firmness that might
work for under-eye concealer examinees
that brush to blend does that look like
complete complete full coverage to me on
camera and as your finder it is that
actually brightened up a lot I feel like
it's not quite as full coverage as
heart-shaped tape or my BH Cosmetics
concealer I'm going to go ahead and just
dip it straight into the pot and apply
that to the lid when I hit it with a
certain angle a little bit scratchy I'm
kind of scared to set my under eyes
right now because you guys know I have
weird issues with under eye setting
powder after use a super specific brush
and powder I have two powders that I use
the Physicians Formula translucent
correcting powder or stargazer powder
and I use a really compact elf brush as
kind of made for foundation so that is
the only way that my powder doesn't take
away to cover to my concealer so I'm
thinking I'm going to find like the
stiffest kind of brush I can for that
this one is very flimsy I think the
overall theme of this gold brush that is
it's soft but super flimsy which could
be nice for certain things
these ones definitely have a bit more
girth to them whoo I love that word I
think I might have to use this kabuki
because there's not really another
option in this side this one I want to
use for blush bronzer let's just pray to
the concealer guards right now
my concealer has definitely looked worse
wouldn't be my go-to brush for under-eye
concealer but it worked as a cosmetic CC
cream is very dewy luminous and creamy I
always like to set it unless I'm not
wearing any other makeup so inside my
face with the Laura Geller balance in
Brighton powder porcelain I'm really
excited to use Fleming's brushes for
powder I think I'm going to use the
other kabuki and the eMac set this one
feels really nice you could use this for
foundation too probably
I also like to kind of Pat in my powders
whoo I forgot how much I love the CC
cream all right I like that one for
powder I also think this could work as
like an overall big bronzer brush try
brows I'm going to use my Mac fluidline
and it looks like there are eyebrow
brushes in both sets of an angled brush
in each set this gold one again is a bit
more flimsy and there's like powder
flowing out of it the wood one
definitely feels more firm I'm going
with this one my brows badly need to be
tamed right now I just realize didn't
come freedom oh you have a little
browsing in each set these actually look
I bet these are identical actually
haven't used one these in years I feel
like I can't get quite as much precision
as I want with this it's a little bit
big in the gold step there's actually
this super firm kind of oval-shaped
brush that I'm going to use for the tail
end of my brows so not as firm as
expected
all right just kidding going back in
with this if you need a brow brush I
probably wouldn't go with either of
these ones for just a bit too big and
flimsy my brows are a little too large
and in charge right now so I'm going to
carve them out with a cosmetic side by
under-eye illumination I hate this
render the guys a super thick but for
carving out brows awesome because it's
super full coverage and thick so much I
have the Emax brush that looks like it
will be great for carving out brows
let's move on to bronzer I'm going to
try out the cover effect sunkissed
bronzer because I just found this in the
bottom of my bottom bottom of my drawer
is it really hard to say I am kind of
jazzed about this brush I also want to
give this gold set a try so this one
since it's super flimsy looks like it
could be nice as like an all-over
bronzing powder I usually like to you
more concentrated so I can already tell
this is too way too flimsy it just like
kicks up all the powder brushes like
this kind of make me cringe
a brush that I keep talking about I feel
like it's actually pretty multi-purpose
I'm gonna try this bronzer you could
also use this as blush yeah that one's
much more up my alley for a contour
shade I use Mac taupe blush we have a
couple options in the gold brush set
this one I think might be nice let's try
this one this one I'm liking because it
has the right shape to connect two
cantos to contour with but it blends
this brush I use for bronzer you could
also just kind of pinch and use as a
contour so I like this brush I would use
that again I've been kind of into
contouring just like the tip of my nose
lately I feel like it adds some nice
shape in there which brush there's kind
of like an angled shadow brush that
could work that looks a bit big oh
there's also an angled brush in the
would set this one is just so soft and
nice you can tell which set is pulling
ahead so far and I basically just like
to follow the OOP that's intense tip of
my nose shape kind of blusher when you
use physicians form in the butter blush
this is actually when they're new shades
this is the shade rosy pink I love the
floorman of these blushes so I'm super
happy that they came out with more
shades I'm gonna use that same brush
that I use for bronzer because I think
this will be really nice for blush too I
just like the shape of this because it's
small enough to get where you want it to
but then I also blend so I just got way
too much yeah I'm into this brush I am
so excited to put this thing on my face
this is the cargo HD picture perfect
highlighter and bronze which sounds like
it's going to be a disaster but I got
this in the fat suits on unboxing which
I'll put over here and I put it on in
that video and it was stunning somebody
try this out again so in the wood brush
set you don't get a fan brush in this
set you get this fan brush and then you
also get this giant ass fan brush I'm
going to use this smaller one like look
at that shade this gives you that like
wet look just so pretty okay this brush
is like kicking up the powder everywhere
there's really not a highlight brush and
a wood brush set you could use this one
again let's try the bigger one for this
side and you see so large it covers my
whole face whoo
that looks nice though that would give
almost like a little bit more of a
natural effect especially get a bit more
deposited kind of color this one just
looks overall more blended and kind of
natural do the tip of my nose you need
to sing your life this brush apparently
I really like because I just keep
putting it all over my face but I feel
like it just helps to really blend
everything together
to prime my eyes I'm gonna use a soft
ochre Paint Pot and I think I'm just
going to use that same brush that I used
to carve out my concealer with typically
I just use my finger to blend this out
because it's just quicker and easier for
eyes I'm going to be doing a very boring
very basic natural look which I guess is
good because I never really do those on
my channel I don't even know what my
looks are I'd literally just do whatever
comes to my mind I'm going to use the BH
XI and XO palette because there are just
some really good neutral basic shades in
here I have to go run a bunch of errands
so I don't want super intense mikoto in
the gold brush set you have a lot of
kind of smaller precision brushes which
could be really good for the lower lash
line or for doing like liquid eyeliner
and things like that but you don't
really have any good blending brushes
besides this one this looks like a nice
crease brush or even like outer vite but
don't worry wood brush set is coming
through again we have this nice blending
brush thank you what did I use this for
oh the contour there's also this angled
brush and we start out with this orange
e shade right here and I'm just going to
put that into the crease the shade
reminds me is like an Orange Julius did
you guys ever drink those as a kid they
still have Orange Julius so this is
working fine not totally loving it but
not hating it as I'm going to use this
one but I want to use this bigger
blending brush just to add a little bit
more depth with this red brown shade so
I think this brush works fine you just
have to kind of spend a bit more time
than usual working with it almost a bit
too flimsy wear it like bends over on
itself if that makes sense it's just a
bit too long I think not flimsy in the
wood brush set you basically just have
like a lid kind of brush and then you
have this little brush which could be
for the lower lash line you don't really
have any kind of in-between I shadow
brush like this one where you can get in
the crease or anything and go back into
that same exact shade the red one this
is just going to deposit more color
hopefully
it's crazy how with different brushes
you can make the same shade of eyeshadow
look totally different
this one is nice doesn't feel scratchy
or anything on the eyes it's blending
out fine so this one's a win now go back
in with the blending brush with your
options for the lid shade I think I'm
gonna go in with this one from the gold
set and I think I'm going to wet my
brush where's my settings great I'm
gonna go with this light shimmery shade
right in the middle this one is really
pretty on its own but just to give it an
extra pop I'm going to watch the brush
use water for this too also bringing
that into the inner corner I feel like
this is not the brushes fault but just
in general I get way better pigmentation
with my finger for the lid shade so I'm
just going to add a little bit to the
lid with this finger
so now for the lower lash line think of
both brushes there are brushes that
could work for the lower lash line
depending on the look you're going for
just for blending color out there I
think the would set definitely has a
better option it's just a pointed
blender but this one is very very stiff
feeling I'm just noticing like you could
almost use this for like smudging out
eyeliner whoa yes a stiff let's try it
so I'm gonna go with that first orange
shade low very very stiff you almost
can't blend with this it's like blending
a stick on your eyes not a fan of that
one don't know what they were going for
there I'm actually going to use the same
brush I used for that red shade in the
crease probably have some color left
over on here so I'm just going to blend
that down there's a flat kind of liner
brush and the gold set I'm going with
this deep brown shade just blend that on
like the outer third I think I'm going
to put eyeliner on the top so it'll even
everything out I'm just going to kind of
stamp that on there and then blend it
out with that other brush because you
can't really blend with this one too and
both of these sets they're missing a
really good lower lash line blending
brush because this one's too big the
other ones are too firm so that is
something that I think you would need to
purchase outside of the set so want to
do eyeliner I don't know I almost just
want to do mascara first I'm going to
set my face just using Urban Decay all
nighter all over gotta love a good
setting spray fish we're taught mascara
I'm just going to layer two Faced better
than sex with Catrice glam and doll I
love this combo and then for the bottom
light and well Magelang what's new I
think I'm just going to do mascara
really want to do eyeliner today for
lips I got this in my Sephora birthday
thing it's the TARDIS lip paint in the
shade birthday suit and I wear this
yesterday and it's a really nice deeper
kind of nude shade on my skintone at
least and I freaking love the smell of
these like a hint of mint that rhymed
can't see my lips and then just to
lighten it a little bit I'm used to 432
overtop these tart ones take a while to
dry so they're easy to mix with things
right so I think I have everything on my
face that I wanted to put on I think
overall if you were only going to buy
one set I would go with the wood ones
the Emax design set these are really
nice they're super soft I do think that
there are definitely brushes that are
missing in here I don't think this will
be like a full complete brush set so I
think this could be a really nice
starter kit if you need more face
brushes in your collection
I think the Kisuke brushes in here are
really nice definitely going to keep
using this one for powder I really like
this and also this brush blush I use for
bronzer and blush I really like to I'm
going to keep using this one I think
this foundation brush works totally
great it's just personal preference I
like a little bit more firmness in my
foundation brushes I feel like I get
better coverage she's also have short
handles which can be you know depending
on what you like good or bad fit to
travel is because they're smaller but
for everyday brushes it might get kind
of annoying for some people I wish they
had a couple more options for eye
brushes in here because then it would be
a total complete set I think the main
thing that this set is lacking is crease
brush and a lower lash line brush if you
have those two brushes I think the rest
of these brushes could work also a
highlight brush so it's not a good
highlight brush in here gold set on the
other hand I feel like has nice options
for those things but those are the only
things on this set I really like the
highlight brushes in here we're great
you have the nice crease brush in here I
would totally use this brush again for
contour I really like how it blended out
my contour the quality and these I can
tell is a little bit more cheap you can
like see certain brushes like peeling
off the glue I already see ya did you
guys hear that like I can break this one
off I'll be won't hold up as well but
you never know I don't think it's worth
it to slowly get this brush set just for
those two brushes I almost would go with
a wood brush set and then just invest in
a couple brushes feels a little bit too
cheap and flimsy to me I like that this
brush that doesn't feel cheap like it
feels very sturdy it feels nice to hold
and this nice boos are nice I like them
I also wanted to say I didn't notice
either brush set set didn't notice
either brush set bright
I'm distressful right now brush set
brush set haven't noticed either brush
set shedding there we go
yes see a couple loose hairs on this guy
but they're not like coming out same on
this set and fine any hairs on my face
so that's prompting my mind that even
though these are initially cheaper than
a lot of other options I don't know how
they're going to wear yet I don't know
if the handles are going to come off the
both sets will be a link down below
