always end up on Amazon and you know
when you find something and then they
keep recommending things to you I kind
of gotten this downward spiral of makeup
on Amazon that I haven't heard anything
about so a couple of these things I
picked up because they had really
amazing reviews and the other things I
was just curious about like this what
the heck
so I have five different products here
that you can find on Amazon that I'm
going to be testing out in this video
and leave links to them down below if
you guys have anything that you want me
to try out from Amazon any makeup let me
know what they are down below you can
tweet me the links as well but if you
enjoy this video while you're watching
don't forget to give it a thumbs up if
you're new here you can join the baby
doe family and subscribe I upload Monday
Wednesday Friday is 6 p.m. Pacific time
so if you want to see how I got this
look and when I think of some random
Amazon makeup in the right place just
keep watching alright so it is the
afternoon when I'm filming right now
which feels very weird because I usually
film first thing in the morning
everybody wash moisturize primed my face
I'm trying out a sponge from Amazon this
one got really good reviews there was a
ton of sponges on there that had a ton
of reviews for some reason this one
stood out I know if it's just because
it's black or what this is the Zenden
Naturals premium Beauty sponge it
retails for five dollars ninety seven
cents and you get free shipping if you
have Prime if you don't have Prime what
are you doing and it has 933 reviews and
has 4.5 stars so that's pretty goodness
says it's latex for you I'm going to
dampen it but let's see how it feels
without being definite it feels nice as
a nice squish to it even when it's not
damped yet so here's the size
pre-wedding I'm going to go dampen this
and see how big it gets alright so this
thing got pretty dang big it's like the
size of my cheek but it feels really
nice and squishy of a foundation I'm
going to mix the covergirl vitalist
health elixir I just did a foundation
Friday on this with the stargazer white
foundation still testing out white
foundations for the video I'm going to
try this combo because this shade is way
too dark after that video when I was
doing the description box I realized
that there is a 705 shade in this
foundation but I couldn't find it online
anywhere so I'm just going to have to
check a bunch of different drugstores to
see if I can find it but I am loving
that foundation so I really want to make
it work with the white mixer so like I
just have to mix in a shit-ton let's go
ahead and see how this goes
usually with sponges for my face like to
use a bottom
the sponge I just feel like I get the
best application in coverage that way
sounds kind of a chemical assent to it
the sponge it feels nice and squishy I
don't feel like I'm getting the best
coverage but that could just be because
I mixed in a ton of that mixer
doesn't feel quite as squishy as the
morphe sponge or Beauty Blender or the
Real Techniques sponge is kind of like
in the middle with firmness yeah I'm not
getting nearly as good of coverage with
that mixer in there totally shared that
one out the sponge feels extra large
like I'm not used to holding a sponge
quite this big but it's blending it out
nicely need a bit more coverage so I'm
actually just going to take some my
laura geller cover lock and go over top
of that alright so I like how this
sponge is applying the laura geller
foundation I think I still prefer my
morphe and Real Techniques sponges just
because this one is so big it's a little
bit awkward if I can pouncing like a
clown nose on my face or something I've
been enjoying the BH Cosmetics Studio
Pro concealer which I also tried out in
a recent video let's try and use the
sponge to blend this out and just see
how it goes I usually don't like sponges
for my concealer so I might be switching
to a brush but my little try disappear
but I just love that this one feels
really moisturizing when it first goes
on but then it sets kind of like a combo
of the tart shaped tape with the Urban
Decay Naked skin concealer I'd like to
make it when it goes on but then it kind
of dries down and sets like the tart
shaped a pose a little bit large and in
charge to blend out your under-eye
concealer with the sponge but it's
working priming my eyelids with some Mac
Paint Pot I have noticed that if you
don't set this concealer right away it
will crease so I'm going to go in with
this product which I am so curious about
I also have the blush little thing that
we're going to try out but this has a
white shade in here and it says white
for brightening skin color at t-zone and
chin center but I'm going to use that
under my eyes as well basically just
multifunction powders with a bunch of
different shades I think I'm also going
to try one of the bottom shades to
contour this thing has four stars 107
reviews and retails for $11.99 free
shipping and it's the you can be
contouring kit face powder Bulova
longest name so I'm just going to take
this top one maybe a combo
and second lightest ones I can open it
to seize the second last one I feel like
I could almost use as a face cutter but
I might mix that one with the white
powder on top right here I'm gonna start
out with the white one and if it's too
late I can always darken it woo feels
super soft and it's not making my under
eyes look dry or anything you guys know
I have a weird thing with my undereyes
and powders there's like very few
powders I can use under there that don't
give me weird texture and take away two
coverage and this one doesn't seem to be
doing that I wouldn't say it's quite as
light as the Stargazer pressed powder
that one's more of a white this is kind
of like a it does have a white tint to
it you can see it on my finger but when
you blend it in it kind of just goes
into more of like a translucent with a
little bit of a tint versus the
Stargazer press powder which is a white
powder but I like how that's looking and
brightened up under there a little bit
and it just feels super freaking baby
but soft before I go back and with this
thing I'm just gonna plot my eyebrows on
really quick inhaling some powder I
didn't pick up any brow products off of
Amazon so I'm just using my normal two
products which will be linked down below
this thing has a mirror on it oh it does
interesting holding this thing the
browser on I'm trying to decide if I
want to use this thing as an all-over
face powder I feel like I should I want
to try it so here's what the second
shade looks like let's see what the
third one down looks like a little bit
tricky to open whoa this third one has a
glitter in it so if you're going for a
twilight vibe maybe that's supposed to
be a highlighting shade the fourth one
down does not have glitter so I think
this is like a face powder
yeah looks too dark ooh that one looks
like it could be a nice contour shade so
I'm going to go in with the second shade
is using my four last cb4 brush guys
feel super soft and they don't have that
powdery kind of look to them almost
looks like a translucent powder that
effect know if I want to do my forehead
just because I like the way my forehead
is looking right now I don't want it
super matte so I think I'm just going to
stick to that I definitely want to try
this thing to contour so I'm going to
use that bottom shade and on the very
bottom you actually don't get a shade
it's just a little sponge guy chillin
so now with my wet and wild contour
brush I've no idea how pigmented this is
so let's just so I feel like that looks
quite different and it does in the pan
and the panel looks very cool toned and
on it's looking pretty warm it's
blending out though like I like the
consistency of these powders they're
pretty
buttery and not super difficult to blend
out my skin turn on the shade of this
one is more like a warm kind of bronzer
I mean it's pretty though I might bring
a little bit of this up to the temples
not usually bronze my temples I'll bet
it's blend it out I actually don't mind
the shade it's just warmer than I
expected but I think it totally works
I'm really curious about the blusher
thing I think I'm gonna use these as
eyeshadows as well so these are
waterproof this retails for $11.99 free
shipping so anna has ninety four ratings
with four stars so whoa that one is like
a neon pink don't think I'm going to be
using that one we have another neon
paying for this one's more like a dark
baby doll we have another neon orange
this is gonna be fun these middle ones
man or heart open alright come on
whoops just totally dug my nail into
that one this color looks really pretty
am I going with that one got it open
with tweezers we have another kind of
you should blush there so I'm definitely
thinking I want to go in with this one
that I dug my talent to it looks like
that picked up quite a bit of product I
just tapped my brush in once yeah very
pigmented I think I would pass on a
blush stat just because I feel like
there's not enough colors in here that
are actually super wearable and then the
one that is is very very pigmented you
can make it work I just feel like there
are better blush formulas out there it's
actually kind of good that this thing
was more of a bronzer than a contour
because I just realized I got this brush
to try out which I'm super curious about
first of all I love the practicing on
this and people are basically saying
that this is like a dupe for the NARS
eita brush and look at this thing
looks like a rainbow unicorn brush very
light this one is the do color
professional kabuki flat contouring
brush retails for $8.99 and free
shipping and it has 4.5 stars with 94
ratings so imma try it with my
Physicians Formula
the contour palette the middle shade
right there normally I would contour
first but that's okay do what you got to
do this is very large as you can see I
can't really see anything on there let's
see supersoft whoa it's actually very
very soft I feel like this has actually
just the right amount of firmness where
you can get that line you can also blend
upwards so it's not a superstar client
oh I'm liking that this one I'm really
liking like you get a really nice
contour but it's just easy rainbow
unicorn brush is the wind in my book so
I'm going to try out the stacks as
eyeshadows as well a lot of times I use
my same contour products and bronzer
products for eyeshadows so I'm go in
with that bottom shade that we used as a
bronzer contour just put that right into
the crease I'm just going to do a really
simple basic kind of eye look today
this blends out really easily as
eyeshadow as well I'm going to take that
kind of glittery shade and just see what
happens when I put it on my lid whipping
out the tweezers or something with the
packaging the middle shades in here you
cannot get open with your fingers I'm
going to put that right on the lid I
think I'm gonna take a tiny bit of this
orange e shade from the blush palette
and put that into the crease yeah I feel
like these blushes are more like
eyeshadows that's how pigmented they're
but looks pretty as eyeshadow I'm going
to blend the bottom shade down on the
lower lash line again yeah I'm feeling
that shade alright so this is the key
key eyeliner pen made in new jersey USA
so since a precise liquid eyeliner pen
retails for $4.99 was free shipping this
one has 184 views with three and a half
stars
so not amazing but we'll try it out
technically not supposed to really wear
eyeliner since I have lash extensions on
right now but do it for YouTube so it
has a really short tip to it looks like
it has a nice fine point but it's very
short mirrors just gonna have to be in
frame for a sec oh we didn't do a
highlight we'll do that after oh I'm
going to attempt to do a wing with this
with the lash extensions wings are hard
to do period so we'll see how this goes
this one I would say is not bad but not
good it's kind of one of those that if
you go over the line it kind of removes
the product
I do like the tip on here it was easy to
get the sign point but it feels a little
bit rough doesn't glide on kinda have to
turn it on its side to get the super
black color out and lashes coming off so
definitely not the worst liquid liner
I've tried there's just something about
it that I'm not that into I think it's
just the way that it feels on your I
kind of just tugs and doesn't glide on
the smoothest for highlight I'm going to
use the Carli bybel palette again but I
want to try mixing these two shades
right here this one's more of like a
peach highlight and here's a white so
I'm gonna mix those can't find my usual
one Wild mega links for the bottom
lashes right now so I'm just going to
use my Catrice glamour doll I didn't get
any lip products off of Amazon yet so
I'm going to do the pure obey liquid
lipstick alright so that's everything I
think out of everything I'm most into
the brush I would definitely continue to
use this I just love how soft it is and
I feel like it's just the perfect amount
of stiffness with this we can blend it
out but you still get a nice contour I
don't have the NARS eat a brush to
compare this to but I've tried similar
brushes and I feel like this one is
definitely my favorite so far out of
this kind of shaped brush I also just
realized I probably could have used this
as a highlight brush too I'm gonna try
that out I also really like this guy
like the under eye powder in here my
under eyes look great right now
creased Adalia and it just feels super
smooth under there and I also do like
this shade I like how it blended out
more of a warm tone color but I think it
still works
I would definitely pass on the blushes
not that into these same with the
eyeliner I just think for five more
bucks get the Physicians Formula eye
booster I did a whole video on how I do
my liquid liner with that and then the
sponge I think is nice it's just like I
said a bit big for me and I would
definitely still go for my Real
Techniques sponge or the morphe sponge
over this but it's definitely not bad it
works it's soft and squishy so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you did
make sure you give it a thumbs up
definitely let me know down below like I
said if you have any other products that
you've come across on Amazon I'm down to
try anything so leave your links down
below or you can tweet me love you guys
