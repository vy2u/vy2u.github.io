Amazon did it to me again got sucked in
went down the makeup hole but now I'm
trying it out for you guys so today
we're gonna be testing out five
different products that I got off of
Amazon but I haven't heard anything
about or ever seen in my life I should
have two different Amazon videos one I
tried out Amazon brush sets and then
another and I just stuttered another is
just like this testing out random makeup
to link both of those down below in the
description box let's put Amazon makeup
on my face if you're cited for this
video don't forget to give it a thumbs
up so if you want to see how I got this
look and what I think about some Amazon
makeup you're in the right place just
keep watching okay it's Saturday night
it's like 8 p.m. and I'm filming I was
gonna film this morning like I usually
do but I just wanted to have a weekend
for once like I just needed to take the
day I went at the beach that's what
people do on the weekends right it
actually feels so good to film right now
because it's nighttime and I always film
first thing in the morning when I have
like zero energy
so first Amazon products we're gonna be
testing as a setting spray that I think
I want to use underneath my makeup and
on top of it just to see how it is as
kind of like a primer I do like using
certain setting sprays as primers oh it
has a rooibos in it this is the pure
bliss Bella Jade makeup setting spray it
has organic tea extracts in it this was
11:49 free shipping with prime it gotta
love prime am i right I'm curious about
this it got really good reviews let's
see how I think I had like 1200 reviews
yeah 1200 reviews you got to be careful
with Amazon reviews a lot of them are
fake but you can kind of tell if you
look at the pictures and stuff which
ones are fake reviews or which ones are
like the paid reviews and which ones are
just real oh it looks like I find mr.
gonna smell anything
did I just land on my leg oh I just got
a whiff of that thing that smells
interesting and it smells like the
thrift store hmm I get the tea vibes now
like thrift store mixed with tea it has
a really nice fine mister and it feels
very refreshing get four fluid ounces of
product in here which is the same as
Urban Decay all nighter leaving a little
bit of a tackiness which I like for
underneath my makeup looks like it has a
little bit of a do to it too which could
be nice for on top of makeup I'm gonna
set my makeup with this too and see how
it looks over the foundation but the
next product we're gonna try out is the
do color no color multiple kabuki
foundation brush and powder brush here's
the box I don't know what's multiple
about this whoa you get a little
boo that was the wrong way to do that
don't get that at home oh that feels
supersoft so this is actually the same
brand as this brush which I tried out in
the last Amazon video which I still
really like for contouring bristles feel
really nice and soft but they are pretty
dense which is actually what I like for
foundation so this is promising
this is only $6.99 with free shipping it
has almost 5 stars 112 reviews does it
come in different colors oh you have
different color options too you could
get a pink or a green if you're feeling
wild so the foundation I'm gonna be
trying this out with is the milk makeup
blur foundation this has been one of my
favorite foundations lately it is
beautiful this is one of those
foundations that is just pretty hard to
make look shitty it just looks great
when when you're having bad skin days so
I'm just gonna dip the foundation brush
directly in there let's try this out
definitely feels pretty firm the
stiffness feels kind of like the Sigma
f80 - which is the round kabuki I mean
look at that freaking coverage of a
separate video on this foundation when
Jo link down below I don't know if I
just said that or not I think I did I
mean this brush is applying it great I
don't know why I'm doing half my face
like we're doing a foundation first
impression I like to apply my
foundations and kind of a dabbing
stipple motion like this rather than
full on blending since that is how I get
the best coverage but just for shits and
giggles to try out this brush let's
blend on this side if you are someone
who likes to blend whoa I mean that's
working so that works totally fine with
this foundation actually I feel like I'm
getting the same amount of coverage I
like this brush of course with brush
first impressions you don't know how
they're gonna wash or anything like that
and how they're gonna shed how long
they're gonna last so just keep that in
mind but like I said in the Amazon brush
video I have more affordable drugstore
brushes that have held up just as well
as some of my Heron brushes it just
depends let me know if you guys want to
see an updated brushes video I feel like
I have a decent assortment of random
brands and brushes that I've been using
which would be after 15 days of
foundation because that starts this
Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time 2 days
so exciting alright I'm feeling this
brush no complaints I think it blended
it out beautifully I would definitely
use this again gave me good coverage
it's soft and it's sick
sex just because it's here I'm gonna try
and blend out my under-eye concealer
with this just to see this is just the
maybelline instant age rewind concealer
right now I almost feel like I could use
this brush for under-eye powder as well
I like more of a dense brush for that I
feel like it gives the most flawless
under-eye for me this has liquid on it
right now I'm not gonna try the powder
under there but I'm gonna go ahead and
powder my under eyes do my brows and
I'll be right back so holy Amazon things
started again because I was actually
looking for a powder that was kind of
luminous like the cosmetics celebration
foundation illumination that I love I
love a powder that's gonna set my face
but this still gives you that kind of
glow and makes your skin look like skin
so that's why I found this thing this is
the liqueur translucent powder s loose
setting powder foundation and
highlighting face powder
this is 1195 free shipping with prime I
need to stop saying that assume
everything is free shipping with Prime
so this is supposed to give you a soft
healthy luxurious glow like no other so
I am really curious about this I
obviously have quite a bit of do going
on here's what the packaging looks like
let's unseal this since it is 8:40 p.m.
right now I'm obviously not gonna be
able to wear this stuff throughout the
day and show you like a check-in at the
end
kind of just like first impressions
trying it out I usually can get a feel
if I'm going to like a powder or not
right when I put it on I'm going to have
some of that in the clip that comes out
really fast which I actually like
because I hate when you have to tap a
freaking powder for two hours to get it
out I go to powder brush for pressed
powders is the fur less cb4 brush if I
want something a little bit more loose
that I can kind of blend out I'll go in
with the more fini one this one is just
a little bit less dense than this brush
so I'm gonna try both I'm gonna start
out with the morphe one on this side of
my face
with a lot of translucent powders it
kind of takes away my coverage so I'm
hoping that doesn't happen I'm just
flying everywhere I don't like to
full-on blend until my liquid is set
because that'll definitely take away the
coverage yes it did take away some of my
coverage feels really nice and soft bro
can he not okay over here I'm gonna try
this brush and then on the center of my
forehead I wanna try the other brush you
can see it like mattify you can totally
see a difference between that side and
that side I'm not seeing like the major
glow
yes when light hits it like very light
glow I don't know I'm not really seeing
the glow so let's try that for less cb4
brush get ready to inhale powder when
you put this on okay I definitely like
this brush better I feel like that kept
some of the coverage yeah on my nose I
definitely see the glow do you guys see
that I don't know man I don't really see
a glow besides on my nose I mean it is
glowing right here but other than that
even when I try and like catch my face
and the light maybe this is one of those
powders that looks different outside in
natural light so I'm not that into this
one off the bat doesn't look bad but it
doesn't look the best next up is this
contour palette this is by bu is kinda
looks like one of those contour palettes
that you can find out like Rosso
t.j.maxx something has a really oh that
smells so strong whoa it smells like
you're inhaling fumes of like a factory
which is probably great for me to keep
sniffing yes the powder that's a little
concerning because I don't smell it as
much when it's closed
yep I think that's the powder wonderful
can't turn back now
this is 12 bucks to get three contouring
powders three highlighting powders not
highlighting as in like cheek highlight
but just under the eye I don't think
this one would be light enough but I
might try adding just a little bit oh
that's soft wait let's try it on the
face actually it's the face powder maybe
see if I can cover up some of this acne
so that wouldn't be too dark for
underneath my eyes cuz it's kind of just
like blending in with my skin right now
I don't think it has a whole lot of
coverage to it yeah it doesn't seem to
be doing a whole lot ok let's try out
the contour shades so you get three
different shades in here the one I'm
most drawn to is definitely this cool
toned contour shade this one is a little
bit warmer that could potentially also
use as like a bronzer really pigmented
they're soft super soft super pigmented
like holy that light a shape looks
really nice I want to try the lightest
one there are street cleaners right now
it's a weird time to film in like I'm
waiting for a street cleaner to drive by
right now
so I think I want to try the lightest
shade ads like contouring this side of
my face and maybe going with the bronzer
shade on the other side these looked
pretty pigmented when i swatched him so
I just dipped my brush in one so we'll
see how oh yeah these are very pigmented
whoo blend out easily the tone of that
looks really nice not too warm let's try
the bronzer shade on the other side I'm
gonna use my flower beauty brush this is
the middle shade i'm going in with now
oh that one's definitely warmer again
blends out totally fine I think on my
skin tone I definitely prefer this one
this one looks a little bit too warm for
me so I'm gonna go back in and add that
lightest cool tone shade we're gonna
have an intense she bone today make it
even I'm gonna add a little bit more of
the warm shade on this side not noticing
this smell like blending it on my face
it's kind of just when you open the
palette it's like holy what is that
scent I'm add a little bit of that
lightest contour shade under my lip just
makes it look more plump then also to
the tip of my nose and only contouring
the sides of my nose I do like adding a
little bit right here
tricky doing eyeshadow with these lash
extensions but I think I'm just gonna
add a little bit of concealer to like
prime them and just go in for a really
simple look using that contour palette I
do like using my bronzers and contour
shades as eyeshadows as well I'm gonna
go with that light shade pop that into
the crease I mean I like how the product
is going on and how it looks on my face
but because of the scent I don't know if
I would use this again yeah like that's
kind of a sign there's probably
something in here that you don't want to
be putting on your face as I continue to
use it I'm popping some of the warmer
middle shade into the crease they do
have a highlighter to try out and I
think I'm gonna put this also on the
lids of my eyes the color salon
highlighter powder in the number is 0-1
I think they had another shade of this
let me check
they have a white in a pink shade I
don't actually know which one that I
ended up getting oh I got white it says
on the back and this is $8.99 this one
only has two reviews I don't even know
how I found this one you know how they
keep recommending you stuff when you
click on something I think it was just
one of those products here's what looks
like in the pan it actually doesn't
really look reflective at all
pan these are my to go to highlighting
brushes the Sigma fo3 and the morphe m5
10 let's try the Sigma one on this side
of my face and the morphe on the other I
feel like it's emphasizing my texture
quite a bit like you can see all my
pores right there
try the morphe brush on the other side I
don't think I like this on my skin I
feel like it's just emphasizing all of
my texture just doesn't look very
flattering on the skin okay so let's try
this as an eyeshadow am i still smelling
the furqan contour palette or is this
smell - I'm smelling the contour palette
as it's just sitting open on the table
this one has a little bit of a chemical
scent - but not nearly as bad apply this
to the lid I can't actually see where
I'm putting shadow on my lids with the
lash extensions all I see straight on is
like the lash I'm gonna try wetting the
brush not really feeling this as an
eyeshadow or a highlight on symbol ish
it's just the makeup revolution blushing
hearts before we test out the last
product I'm gonna do a final spritz of
this setting spray to see how it goes on
over foundation my face right now is
looking pretty matte after that powder
so let's see if this adds some do back
into my skin I really like the mister on
that thing
oh wait that just definitely helped to
settle some of that powder down really
like what that just did on my forehead
it definitely added a bit of do eNOS I
obviously can't test if this made my
foundation last any longer anything
throughout the day but off of just how
it looks I would definitely use that
again okay this thing looks like frickin
Dexter plastic wrapped it so onto the
last product this is as much of the tag
as I can get off this anyone else's pet
peeves this is by Sacha cosmetics it's
their long-wear intense color transfer
resistant matte liquid lipstick
available in 18 shades and I got the
shade to rev it up and it retails for
$15 on Amazon kind of got looped into
all the soft Joe products when I was on
there so I ended up checking out their
website and it looks like they have some
interesting powders and things I kind of
want to try out some other stuff from
them I don't know if they're popular in
other countries I haven't heard of them
at all in the US that's pretty cute
packaging like the frosted plastic with
a little black polka dots 15 bucks for a
liquid lipstick isn't
Sara Lee cheap smells like finger paints
this applicator feels hella cheap feels
very thin kind of doing that thing or if
you rub over it kind of wipes off the
color
that is looking pretty patchy I think
this is definitely one that I'm gonna
have to do two colors especially to get
the color that it looks like in here I
mean that's a huge difference is going
on so streaky all right that just way
too long to get one coat of that it is
very drying feeling it does set down
really quick but it feels super super
dry the shade is very patchy you don't
get even opaque color at all so I'm
definitely gonna go in with the second
layer right now oh no I'm like really
moving around this color to try and make
it look as even as possible but you
really have to work with it that is as
good as we're gonna get I don't think
I've ever spent more time applying a
liquid lipstick application how patchy
and dry it feels for 15 bucks this is
definitely a hard pass I wouldn't even
pay five bucks for this it is making my
teeth look white I think that's the only
thing I like about good old wrap it up
so that's everything I got to try out I
think my top two right now is definitely
the foundation brush I would a hundred
percent use this again it feels really
nice and soft like how dense it is I got
the same kind of application and
coverage as I get with my other brushes
even blending this and circular motions
rather than just stippling it deciding
spray I'm also definitely gonna continue
to use it did something to the finish of
my foundation that just looks really
nice I'm not the biggest fan of the
scent for me if I have like the organic
tea scent in my mind rather than like
thrift store nothing against thrift
stores a little good thrift store but it
does kind of smell like a thorough store
but if I have that in my mind it doesn't
smell quite as bad when you're spraying
it
I like the actual shade and formula of
the contour powder it's super soft and
it blend out easily it looks nice it
just smells toxic I probably should not
put this on my face again highlight in
liquid lipstick save your money it would
not purchase either of these again I
