favorites around to because I'm so happy
that you guys like the first one because
I love talking about Amazon products if
you missed it I did a whole video on my
top Amazon recommendations that was just
like a general one and then this video
is gonna be all focused on my Amazon
travel recommendations so when I'm not
filming or working in Seattle I mean
they're on a trip planning a trip or
looking at kayak explore I've lived
abroad I travel a lot I love traveling
traveling is like if I could only do one
thing for the rest of my life I would
travel these products are come above
things for domestic travel or
international travel depending on what
trip you're taken where you're going so
if you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the bay radio
family and subscribe I upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific
Time today's video is obviously a bonus
video this week I think it's going up on
Tuesday so yay for bonus videos all
right so let's start out with the basic
that you can use no matter where you're
going I'm gonna preface this by saying
I've never been a packing cube person
never been into him I find that they
almost take up more room for some reason
just the way that the clothes fit into
them and just the way they like lay in
the suitcase and everything I've always
felt like I can make more room by just
putting the clothes directly in until I
found these I got these off of Amazon
obviously these are compression packing
cubes I have a bunch of different sizes
so what you do is you roll your clothes
so like in this bag output whatever
scarves swimsuits anything smaller in
here you would roll everything up or
just stuff it in however you want to do
it you zip it up with the green zipper
and then you use this gray zipper right
there to make it smaller and it just
pushes the arrow as it does that and it
actually works it saves so much space
and when I was on my Europe trip a
couple months ago I used these and all I
brought for that trip for a few weeks
was a carry-on bag and I fit all of my
stuff in there like down jackets winter
stuff scarves everything I started at 18
bucks depending on how many bags you get
but these are totally worth it in my
opinion next up is one of my favorite
Amazon buys of all time not just like
travel I've had this for a couple years
now and I still use this thing and I
still love it this is a wallet this
isn't just any wallet we'll get into it
this is $13.99 and they have 32
different colors in this thing this has
lasted me a couple years and I bring
this on
every single trip I go on so the cool
thing about this wallet is not only is
it super flat so it doesn't take a lot
of room in whatever you're carrying but
is designed to be a passport holder
wallet so it has this slip back here
where you can just slide in your
passport a spots for all of your cards
money spot back here coin wallet are you
sure I still have some kind of money
and if you're traveling the worst
feeling is when you feel like you have
no idea where your passport is and with
this thing every single time after I use
it I just slip it right back in here and
it's in there for good I actually use
this as my main wallet here not
traveling for a long time because it
just takes up no room in your purse if
you don't want to bring a full on purse
they can almost double as like a clutch
so this next thing is actually right in
here I kept the original box because I
just keep the ink in here this is
totally not something that's necessary
it's just if you're a pen person like I
am this mini pen is by Narwhal and it
actually comes with two of them in here
and you get extra little ink sets these
are 1295 for two of them it's a mini pen
totally not necessary but the reason why
I really like this is because it's
lightweight I can slide it in that
wallet just right there in that spot
before I got this pen I was that person
every single time on the plane who would
have to ask my neighbor for a pen when
you feel it like the customs forms so
now I'm not that person
thank you normal I also journal on trips
now which we'll talk about in a second
so for that too it's handy just always
good to have a pen you can always use a
pen so when you're traveling to another
country the voltage of the electricity
is usually different and the outlets are
different so you need some kind of
converter adapter and that's another one
things over the years that I just have
so many lying around that are all four
different things until I found this guy
this is a universal travel adapter this
was 13 bucks best 13 bucks I've ever
spent
you actually get to USB things on the
side too which is really cool you have
one right here and then you have little
different things that flip up for
different countries and the other thing
I really like about this is that it
actually says on here so it says like
Japan Australia Thailand Europe usually
or at least the ones I have it just has
types so every time when I'm packing for
a trip you have to like Google the type
and see what countries are in that
certain type instead of just saying the
country so this one just
takes out that extra step and for 13
bucks totally worth it if you're gonna
be doing any kind of international
travel so I have a few different bags I
pack depending on what kind of trip it
is and what I'm gonna be doing and stuff
but this thing I bring almost every
single trip is it's just a super super
lightweight backpack okay I just rolled
that really bad but you can actually
roll this thing up to be even smaller
than this like half the size if you
really tried I think there's actually a
way to like roll it in itself or
whatever and make it really small but
I'm not good with rolling things and
themselves so even if you're not gonna
be like hiking or doing anything where
you really need a backpack like this
this is always good to bring on a trip
because you never know if you're gonna
be shopping or buying some things or
food or whatever reason something can't
fit in your bag when you're going back
home this is one of those bags that just
has like pockets in pockets it also is
big enough to fit a laptop side water
bottle pouches squatter proof it's easy
to clean
super lightweight overall just like a
good backpack to have they have ten
different colors of this and it's 2099
okay if you're a coffee person you'll
emphasize with me on this one this is
just powdered Nescafe this is really
popular in other countries this is what
I drink in Jordan for like a solid year
straight drink arab coffee and Turkish
coffee too but for the most part just if
I wanted to make a cup of coffee or just
use this I personally love the taste of
this I think I'm just so used to it now
and it just reminds me of that that I
love it but it's definitely different
taste than like brewed black coffee
there's two reasons why I travel with
this one you can just empty this out
empty out the powdered coffee into a
plastic bag and pack it it takes up
pretty much no room and you have
caffeine you never know what the
caffeine situation is gonna be you can
of course always find coffee no matter
where you are pretty much but if you're
someone like me who needs caffeine to
function and you have to have it within
like the first thirty seconds of your
eyes opening in the morning then you
won't have to worry about where you're
gonna find your first cup of coffee you
don't need a coffee machine to make this
you literally just need hot water and
almost every hostel has a stove that you
can use in like a water kettle and also
hotels I was just staying at a hotel
where was I
oh that an Airbnb in LA that didn't have
any kind of coffee machine cure
nothing no coffee so this would have
been a perfect thing for that too so if
you're staying at air babies or if
you're staying at a hotel that doesn't
have any kind of coffee machine or
whatever almost always you can find a
water kettle so if you can find a water
kettle and you can make hot water then
you can make coffee with this also
Nescafe is usually cheaper in other
countries so of course when you land
somewhere you could just get this and do
the same thing so you don't really have
to buy it off of Amazon but if you want
to be prepared and you want your
caffeine and you want to know for sure
that you're gonna have your caffeine
then you can get it on Amazon in the US
so this next one I talked all about in
my last Amazon video so I'm not gonna go
super in-depth about it but it is a
total travel must-have for me so I
wanted to mention it again in this video
but this is my toiletry slash everything
bag makeup brushes makeup face wash
everything if you want to hear more
details on this guy check out the last
video but the thing I really love about
this is how flat it is so it just lays
on your suitcase and to cushion it I'll
usually put a jacket on top or something
just so the makeup doesn't break or
whatever but I just love the size of it
I can fit everything I need in it and
it's like the perfect travel all-in-one
kind of bag for toiletries and cosmetics
okay so this next one is something that
I not only always travel with but I
almost always keep this in my purse
because my phone dies and literally like
two hours this is the anchor external
battery pack charger so you just plug in
I just have this like mini one that is
really grossly dirty you just plug in
the USB side here and then this side
goes into your phone this thing I think
I also got in Amazon so I'm gonna have
everything linked down below that I'm
talking about by the way this thing is
$12.99 and it is awesome it charges your
phone so fast and it holds battery for a
long time let me see if it says how long
says 5200 mah if that means anything to
you that means nothing to me especially
if you're solo traveling if you're in
another country it's always good to have
a charged phone because you never know
when you're gonna need it whether it's
just for GPS or whatever I just always
like to have something in case my phone
dies so that I can get back to wherever
I need to be
I only downside what this thing is that
it is pretty heavy but I feel like most
these are if you know of a lightweight
one to let me know down below so these
next things are called gear ties I have
these in black that I use but I just got
another pack because I need more and so
I could show you guys packaging and
stuff but these are reusable rubber
twist ties so basically you can use
these to organize your cords
I have been someone for years that just
throws all my chords in my purse and
when I'm trying to actually get
something out there like completely
tangled in earphones and ten other
things and this solves those problems I
have black ones but I feel like these
actually will be better so that I can
just see them like at the bottom of a
dark bag easier the neon ones but they
basically just twist around and you can
tie up your cords however you want to if
you have really thin hair and you ran
out of a hair band I guess you could try
and use this this would hold like two
pieces of my hair journaling like I said
is something that I have recently
started doing this still needs to be
organized for my last trip but I got
really into getting like decals where I
could find them in postcards and stuff
just to put in these journals I got
these black field books and then this
outer leather thing that holds them I
like this because it has a wrap around
things they're just gonna keep
everything in there this trip was from
January and I already feel like I forget
a shit-ton the stuff so I don't know if
you're someone like me who has like
major memory issues then journaling
could be a good idea especially if
you're gonna be taking a bunch of busses
and trains and stuff and you need to
entertain yourself journaling is just a
good good way to kill time so this next
one is gonna be solely if you are a
photographer videographer youtuber or
you just like to travel with cameras so
this is a really stylish looking camera
bag I've talked about this before a
while ago when I first got it I got it
little probably like a year and a half
ago now I think I've showed this in a
vlog or something but basically you have
two different sections you have a bottom
section here and this is a padded camera
bag you would never know by the outside
of it this is mostly for traveling with
like major camera equipment you wouldn't
need this for like a vlog camera but if
you're traveling with like a DSLR and
different lenses and stuff
I like this pouch for memory cards and
then there's different inserts so you
can attach here with Velcro but then
this top part actually fits a shit-ton
and the thing I love is that it has this
padded section back here where you just
super easily slide your laptop down and
it has this pouch right here oh it's had
a memory card oh hell yeah I felt like I
was missing it memory card Wow how long
has that been in there if you travel
with camera equipment but you still want
to look semi stylish this is for you so
this next one is a bag but it's not like
a suitcase suitcase bag let me explain
so my suitcases I use just depend on the
trip I'm going on this next
something that I would bring either if
I'm going on like an overnight trip or
if I'm going on a trip where it's a
little bit more trendy you know I'm
saying so I think this technically
called a weekender bag it has this lung
over the shoulder strap right here that
has the padding and the reason why I
like this is because again is that like
washable material I feel like it looks
pretty nice for the price I think this
was around 40 bucks you have obviously
fake leather straps but it can fit a lot
of stuff in here this is a bag that
would either be a good carry-on or if
you're just going on a super-short kind
of overnight trip you can probably fit
everything in here almost reminds me of
long short long Shop however you say it
but it's 40 bucks and not like 300 all
right so that's everything those are all
of my Amazon must-haves for traveling if
there's anything that you think I need
in my life let me know down below I hope
