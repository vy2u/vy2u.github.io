alright I am so excited for this video
because when I freaking love Amazon and
- I'm just excited to talk about random
things that I feel like you need in your
life so let's just get into it there's a
mix of stuff in here as I was going
through my orders for this video I have
orders going back to 2010 but it's
definitely in the last like three years
where my Amazon shopping has really gone
to the next level it's a little out of
control these are some of my top
recommendations products I found on
Amazon I could probably make like five
different videos in different categories
because I buy that much stuff off of
Amazon so let me know if you guys wanted
to see that I don't want to do like a
separate travel one in home one because
most of stuff is more like lifestyle
random things if you're excited for this
video don't forget to give it a thumbs
up if you're new here you can join the
burrito family and subscribe I put every
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific
time alright so first thing is the
cutest fricking workout resistance bands
you've ever seen in your life
they're called peach bands they come in
this super cute it's like very soft nice
packaging you get four in here that are
all different weights so there's medium
and then it goes up to like extra heavy
and I usually use the medium one or the
heavy depending on what I'm doing but if
you're just starting out with them the
light one is super light so you can just
get a feel for it and whatnot but I just
use these for like booty workouts leg
stuff random things I've been using
these for a couple months - I want to
say and they haven't torn anywhere they
feel like really nice quality I also
bring these with me while I'm traveling
they're super handy you can just put
them in here and then you can do some
hotel workouts and this takes up like no
space in your suitcase this next thing
might be the most random thing I've ever
talked about on my channel
these are peanuts peanuts from Amazon so
this brand is called Deez Nuts wait Jim
used this one is the Cool Ranch Inn
sriracha these ones are my favorites but
also the dill pickle peanuts are really
good too they're not cheap they're like
10 bucks for a thing of peanuts but
they're so good and they last me a long
time and I feel like they're a good
snack just in between I'll just have
like a handful of peanuts my cousin
actually got me hooked on these she
first got me the dill pickle ones
because I am a pickle fanatic these ones
they actually like a little bit more oh
they're so good get
every time so these I've talked about
for years on my channel they've been in
random videos here and there but these
are the crystal collagen gold powder eye
masks there's a bunch of different
versions of these on Amazon so make sure
you get the one that I link below
because I have tried other ones and
they're not as good as these ones these
ones are the hit TC brand comes with 10
pairs of these for $4 free shipping so
super good deal and I actually feel like
these help kind of deep puff my eyes my
under eyes are looking pretty tragic
like the bags are super deep that
morning or something these I feel like
actually it helped a little bit and I
like putting these in the fridge and
then putting them on and it's super
cooling and they just feel really nice
kind of all that I must have tried I
keep going back to these ones so I've
gotten a bunch of different sunglasses
on the amazon over the years but the
ones I think I wear the most and that
you guys always ask about whenever I
post these on Instagram or something
wearing them these are black aviators
that need to be cleaned the issue I
usually have with aviators is that
they're way too big and wide for my face
and these ones are narrow so if you have
that same problem then you might like
these because they are a lot smaller
than usual and they're really reasonably
priced they're really comfortable
they're super lightweight $10.99 and
I've had this one pair for when do I
purchase this says I purchased it last
January so I've had them over a year now
they haven't broken or anything next up
we have a leather cleaner so if you have
any kind of leather in your home or your
car sees whatever that you need to find
a good cleaner for that'll just make it
look really shiny and nice and I
actually like gets up a ton of the dirt
and dust and stuff this one I really
like I got this because it had really
good reviews on Amazon it works it
removes the dirt it makes everything
look nice and fresh again
I have like a mid-century kind of a
leather couch that I bought secondhand
so I do like to clean it a lot because
it can get kind of like dusty looking
good to have good to have all right we
all love a good pair of yoga pants you
know I'm sayin so I actually first
purchased this pair then I loved them so
much that I got a black one that's in
the wash right now and then I also got
this like really cool I don't even know
what this color is it's not quite grey
but it's not dark blue it's kind of like
in-between these are the 90 degree by
reflex I wear the size extra small they
look really tiny but they stretch and
they also suck you in so much these make
your butt look great they're comfortable
to work out with I don't feel like my
body is like show
three when I do squats or anything out
of my Lululemon's my t.j.maxx leggings
and I think actually you can find
ninety-degree at t.j.maxx - but out of
all of my brands of yoga pants these are
the ones that I find myself reaching for
the most because they're so nice just
the way they fit they have a thick band
and I do feel like for some reason this
one the first one I got this color the
fabric feels a bit thicker in a little
bit like different than the other ones I
got it definitely feels different than
this shade so I don't know if this was
like their original one because I did
get these probably like eight months
later then I got this one so this one I
love like the material this is super
soft super thick and this one is still
really nice it just feels a little bit
different it doesn't feel quite as thick
only $18.99 so if you're looking for
good quality affordable yoga pants these
are great these are pens that I use for
my planner I just keep them in this
random case and you know where I got
this but these are just colored pens I
color code my planner for different
things so like this is my You Tube pen
this is my upload pen this is my
appointment pen travel pen you get it it
comes with ten colors these are just the
ones that I use and for 10 colors it's
five dollars and 80 cents and it looks
like this is a Korean brand I believe it
says their fine point markers for bullet
journaling and note-taking and they are
perfect for riding with because they do
have such a fine point here which is why
I really like them I've had these for a
few months now and they haven't dried up
or anything all of them are still going
strong and I use these every single day
for my planner by the way there's a
whole pen community on Amazon people get
really into their pen reviews so if
you're looking for a pen or if you just
need some entertainment read Amazon pen
reviews I pretty much get most of my
YouTube electronic camera tech kind of
gear stuff on Amazon that could be a
whole other category of these videos but
I just wanted to mention two things
which I feel like will apply to more
people than youtubers this is awesome
this is a Bluetooth remote so basically
you just connect this to Bluetooth to
your phone so that if you're by yourself
somewhere and you want to get a picture
of yourself you can connect it to
bluetooth you just turn this on press
the button and it takes a remote photo
this is really great if you don't have
an insta
husband or if you're traveling so little
traveling and you need to take photo
that's what I usually use it for and
it's $8.99 another kind of phone camera
accessory that I've used for a while now
and I love this thing these are
basically like clip-on lenses for $12.99
it comes with three lenses so you get
the super wide angle one this is the one
that I usually use they have a fisheye
and then also a macro this is awesome if
you take your photos using your iPhone
you just clip it on you might need to
take off your case depending on what
kind of case you use but you clip it on
and it just goes right over your camera
so it gives you this like wide angle or
fisheye kind of effect not sure how much
you guys can see on there but it's super
cool just to give your photos like a
little flare get a little artsy and to
undo this you just screw off the clip
and then you can attach it to the other
ones it would not be an Amazon favorites
video if I didn't mention the love of my
life
if you've seen any of my foundation
Friday videos I usually end the night
wearing this thing this is a super stuff
basically like a blanket in jacket form
it has a hood it has pockets I have a
photo on Instagram wearing out I'll
insert it right here so you can see what
it looks like on it's super baggy super
oversized I feel like it's cute enough
to wear kind of like that like with an
actual outfit but 99.9% of the time I
just wear it in my apartment because it
literally feels like you have a blanket
on it's basically like a better version
of a Snuggie it's $36.99 but I have seen
a bunch of other boutiques kind of
carrying this exact one for like double
that price so that was a pretty good
price compared to what I was seeing it
in other places and I get to size small
it is oversized and it looks like they
have different colors they have five
different colors in it so if you're
someone who has trouble making yourself
drink enough water throughout the day
these I mentioned a long time ago to you
in another video but I've used these for
years now a couple years and they're
just glass bottles they're super basic
they're easy to clean you just throw em
right in the dishwasher and I just put
all of these like all six or whatever
into the fridge and for some reason it
makes drinking water so much more fun so
much easier also sometimes it'll do is
since these are already chilled I'll
just pour the water from here into my
other kind of like tumblers or something
whatever I'm in the mood to drink out of
but these are just great you can also
use them for smoothies you could use
them for what
you want coffee and for six of these is
15 bucks so this thing will definitely
be making another appearance if I do the
favorite Travel Amazon buys but I have
to mention this because I'm still
obsessed with this I travel a lot and
I've gone through a lot of travel bags
and this is my favorite makeup bag
hands-down not just for makeup but for
my kind of toiletries and stuff too I
can just fit everything I see if you
guys can see this so here's what it
looks like you have zippers on each side
and then you have this big opening
hopefully you can hear me right now you
can hang it right here if you want to if
you're a hotel hanger I'm not I just set
it on the counter you can also hook it
this way when you open it and I just
keep having my eye patches in here it's
easy to clean it's flat which is a big
thing that's why I love it is that you
just lay it on top of your stuff I'll
usually put like a sweatshirt on top or
my jacket on top so if the suitcase is
getting to run around my cosmetics don't
break or anything but I just love the
size of it it's super flat and slim and
I just feel like it's the best way to
pack my makeup and everything that I
found I can even put my makeup brushes
in the side of here it literally just
it's great fits everything and this is
$14.99 so this next thing is my pop
socket this is a black and white marble
pop socket if you're not familiar with
these you need one I didn't really
understand the hype until I got one now
I can't live without it it just makes
holding your phone so much easier
especially if you have smaller hands and
you have to plus it makes texting way
easier because I can hold it like this
so I don't have to have my hand wrapped
around basically get double the wrap
around you know I'm saying you can also
bend it so whenever I'm watching YouTube
videos as I'm like doing stuff I'll just
bend it like this and prop it up against
the table and it just rests like that
it's also just super addicting to play
with I think I do this like 50,000 times
a day mine's about 10 bucks it's just
the black and white marble alright this
next item I feel like everyone needs one
of these if you're a hot beverage
drinker this is a game changer so you
just plug it into the wall it has a
switch right here and it just keeps your
coffee warm so as soon as my coffee
comes out of the Keurig I just pop it on
here and it keeps my coffee warm for
literally like an hour hour and a half I
always put my coffee on here when I'm
filming so that when I take sips it's
still
if you work from home if you work from
an office and you can just plug this in
at your desk and you want your coffee to
stay warm it's just awesome I love this
thing and this was $9.99 next up we have
a workout item that I don't really use
for working out but this is a sports bra
from Puma I purchased one of these a
while ago probably a year ago now and
then I got a second one about six months
ago because I was just finding myself
reaching for this the most out of any
Brian on a daily basis I don't like this
for working out because it doesn't have
enough support but just for everyday use
if you're someone who likes a sports bra
but you want the thin straps I'm wearing
the other one right now and it's just so
comfortable it gives me enough hold but
it's not underwire or anything it does
have padding in here it has a little
Puma lion tiger Puma is it what is the
Puma it's a tiger is it an actual animal
Wow let's see a Puma is a cougar
okay um anyways has a little Puma guy
right here here's what the back looks
like it has a little hole which is cute
it's just super comfortable you only
have a couple more items this one I
wasn't planning on mentioning but
whenever I am wearing this in like a
vlog or snapchat or something I get so
many questions about it and it's just a
neck wrap ice pack that you can also use
for your knee anywhere else small enough
that you can wrap this around basically
F chronic neck pain so I will wrap this
around and you just literally like look
kind of wild but you just velcro it
around your neck and it's hard to find a
good neck ice pack a lot of them just
like are supposed to kind of go over
your shoulders and they don't actually
get like close enough or tight enough to
the skin and I feel like out of all the
ones I've tried I think I have public
six that I've ordered off of Amazon this
one is my favorite and it's only $12.99
right yeah $12.99 for this one and it's
actually hot or cold so you can actually
heat this up for a few seconds too if
you want it hotter slide them right in
they'll throw it and then it wraps
around I wouldn't say it stays cold for
a super long time just kind of like a
normal ice pack but it's mostly just
this part that I really like so if you
can find an ice pack that stays colder
longer that's bendy then you could slip
it in here if it fit all right folks
this last Amazon favorite is
my vacuum I am so in love with this
thing I'm pretty sure I mentioned this
in moving blog what is this thing called
this is the Hoover Linx cordless it's
way cheaper on Amazon especially right
now I don't know if they're doing some
kind of sale but when I just went to
screenshot it it's $99 it's normally
$1.99 and I remember I found this at
Target but then I looked on Amazon it
was way cheaper so I ended up buying it
on Amazon and this is the best vacuum
I've tried
that's cordless that's super easy to use
you can use it on hardwood or carpet I
actually got my mom one of these for her
birthday and she loves it she uses it
every single day for like just dog hair
and stuff it's super light I love it
that you don't have to fuss with the
cord that is like my biggest thing with
vacuuming I hate having to deal with
plugging in the cord changing the
outlets you know how it goes
so it has a rechargeable battery so it
literally just pops out you pop this in
the charger you just pop the battery in
like that it clicks it tells you when
it's getting low right here and then you
just power it on no cords nothing
there's a couple different settings
depending on if you're using it on
carpet or hardwood it gets everything if
you have an apartment I feel like this
is especially good because it's just a
small vacuum not going to take up a lot
of space and it gets the job done so
those are all of my Amazon must-haves
for this video like I said I literally
have so many more items that I wanted to
talk about I just didn't want this video
to be like 2 hours long so if you liked
this video and you want to see products
in the other categories and you want me
to do other videos like this don't
forget to give it a thumbs up let me
know down below what other Amazon things
I should check out Amazon is just one of
the best things on earth you know thank
