point where they have their own products
like how fricking cool is that that Judi
has her own eyeshadow palette I think
that's amazing Congrats Judi
this is so weird motions / eyelash glue
burn malleable I don't even know how to
start this video right now my heart is
racing I've never been nervous to film
until today so about the last six months
I've been working on something that I'm
finally getting to share with you guys
today it feels very surreal right now
it's been kind of posting sneak peeks
and little clues here and there on
snapchat and Instagram so now should
wear this on snapchat the other day but
I had the opportunity to team up with B
hue Beauty to make my own liquid
lipstick some people thought it was a
burrito line oh man side my own hot
sauce really go in places in the world a
bunch of you guys on Instagram and
snapchat guessed that it was a
foundation line making my own foundation
is definitely on my bucket list I think
if I did that it would be my own brand
though and others a full-time project in
and of itself so that is definitely one
of my goals but this actually came about
before 15 days of foundation even
started so the lipstick is obviously
what I'm wearing right now it is called
1548 and i explain to the significance
of the name in the meaning behind it and
just kind of the whole process of this I
think that we've gotten so used to
collaborations now that kind of
interesting hearing the backstory and
what actually goes into it so I did blog
when I was in New York
this was a super hands-on project I
didn't just tell them what color I
wanted and they made it and I slashed my
name on it this is something that I
pretty much had a say in every single
step is way when I was in New York
actually got to go to the lab and mix
the shade I've talked about the hue
liquid lipsticks in the past and one of
the main reasons that this came about is
because I emailed them saying this is
honestly one of the best liquid lipstick
formulas I've ever used and it is I
would not put my name on something I
don't 100% believe in so on and on the
basis for this product and then I want
to tell you more about the story behind
it why it's named 1548 why chose the
shade I did more about bu and just a
whole process I hope you guys stayed
throughout this whole thing because this
is more than just a liquid lipstick to
me which I know it sounds dramatic but
this is my first product I've ever had a
part in making and it's just a super
imma start crying come on
it just is one of those things that
signifies all the work and years that
I've put into YouTube I've been on
YouTube for almost 5 years now it is all
seems worth it when you hit
don't like this I never thought that
this was going to happen ever as you
guys saw in the intro clip so it's just
really special I'm gonna stop rambling
let's get into the product i'ma start
out with the basics
15:48 is cruelty free and vegan
retailing for $18 the same as all their
liquid lipsticks they do ship
internationally the first 200 burritos
who purchase 1548 are getting a
handwritten note I thought they're
through about 10 episodes of Gossip Girl
signing these things so the first 200
people who purchased will get a
handwritten note so you can purchase
this at vgu beauty.com slash 1548 link
will be right at the top of the
description box down there it is
releasing this Thursday December 15th 10
a.m. Pacific time 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time
set your alarms and get ready 15:48 is
not going to be a permanent part of
their collection this is a limited
edition so if you want it make sure you
hop on on Thursday see you as a brand I
feel like is very much embracing at
different skin tones embracing different
people be unique be yourself and so they
literally just kind of let me run with
whatever I wanted as far as the shade
and the box design the box is one of my
favorite things about this product so
obviously I had to do a marble box I
have the prototype box right now that
had like fold marks on it and stuff it
says the tail on it has a couple
sentences about the lipstick it's black
and white marble I love it 15:48 was the
address of my super shitty college house
sophomore year of college when I started
my youtube channel that is where I first
filmed videos out of comment down below
if you've been here since the Harry
Potter closet sized room the leopard
robe hangin in the background literally
one of my first videos was on camera
eating ramen in that room when I started
filming my parents didn't get it my
friends didn't get it my roommates
didn't get it a kind of just like the
weird person talking to themselves
through camera no one was really super
encouraging or supportive I think
because it wasn't really is like a thing
yet I was a full-time college student
when I started YouTube I kept doing it I
was film on the weekends in film after
class and it's something that I really
loved and now years later if I hadn't
stuck with that and just push through
and continued with it I wouldn't be
doing what I'm doing right now I
wouldn't have the career I have right
now my life would just be completely
different right now I'm just a strong
believer in doing what you're passionate
about even if it's hard even if you have
five thousand others
is to do because you never know where
those passion projects are going to take
you so that is the significance to me
behind the name 1548 as far as the shade
I originally went into it thinking okay
I want to do a news for pale skin there
are very few news liquid lipsticks out
there that are actually flattering on
pale skin and light enough I know a lot
people watch my channel for videos and
content on pale skin but there's also a
lot of baby toes who don't so one is
1548 to really be something that had
looked beautiful on any skin tone I
wanted to make a shade that literally
anyone can wear the perfect red lipstick
to me is something that will never go
out of fashion or style whatever fashion
at a session I knew in my mind exactly
the kind of red that I wanted I wanted a
blood red that had a little bit more
depth to it depth depth is hard to get
off the tongue and after a full day in
the lab we finally nailed it I am so
happy with the final shade this is
exactly what I was envisioning and the
cool thing about this is that it looks
different on every single skin tone so I
want to insert some swatches right here
15:48 off some different skin tones just
so you can see so if you haven't tried
to be hue like lipstick before this is
the same formula but the scent is
different I wanted a like matte lipstick
kind of scent and that's exactly what
this is it smells very similar to math
lipstick you haven't heard the hue
before they're very new company I think
they're little bit fix are totally
underrated when I was in the lab I got
to learn a lot about what actually makes
the formula unique lipstick formula
completely dries down in about a minute
it doesn't transfer in foundation Friday
video I have going up actually wore 1548
along with the foundations you can see
how well it goes up throughout the day
without touching up at all and with
eating meals and drinks and everything
so guys know one of the things I hate is
liquid lipsticks that transfer come off
when you eat I just want to put
something on my face and I just want it
to stay on all day and that is exactly
what these lipsticks do applicator is a
pretty stiff doe foot applicator guy
light because it just makes it easier to
get a clean line for a liquid lipstick
formula they don't feel drying my still
recording hallelujah from watching you
to myself I always think it's kind of
interesting to hear about the actual
process versus just like surprised
here's this by it so I wanted to tell
you guys a little bit about what
actually goes into something like this
obviously I'm not gonna tell you every
little detail but I do have blog footage
from
I'm going to search some of this as I am
talking about this like I said they kind
of let me run with it or super open to
whatever shade I wanted to do they
basically went through Pinterest
Instagram Google Images YouTube
everything trying to find the exact kind
of shade that I was going for we had a
whole inspiration board that we went
back and forth on still kind of what I
came to them with a lot of the work I
would say about 70% of the work happened
in this single day when I was in New
York for that trip when you're there in
the same room with people you can just
crank it out so much faster than going
back and forth on email 5,000 times it
was really cool because I not only got
to be hands-on actually making the
products I got to see how labs works how
it functions learn more about the be
human and the people behind it which by
the way are awesome huge thank you
obviously to be Huw for making this
possible it's a totally women run
company which I love they're all young
they're just doing it just really loves
the people behind the brand so it's cool
getting to actually chill with them so
my mom actually got to come with me to
the lab which is really cool for her to
see everything too
and that she helped me film a lot of the
footage so thank you mama they read oh
and I'm on the graphic designer so she
was kind of given her two cents on
everything which is great we basically
went there's a landing page of site all
the marketing materials to shave the box
everything that day filmed an interview
with them that I'm pretty sure will be
on their site and I include a couple
clips of it in this video as well but
once we got to actually go in the lab I
just thought it was the coolest thing
basically the lab they work out of does
lots of different brands so it's really
crazy to see like foundation samples and
moisturizer and skincare and lipstick
all being made for different brands
Kayleigh on the BPU team is like the
mixing magician she's one who stood
there with me for hours I think we were
literally in that lab for seven hours
trying to get this shade exactly right
this was like months ago now so I'm
trying to remember this correctly but
there's basically based colors picture
it's the primary colors and then black
and white and you can make any shade
from those colors you can change the
undertone by adding blue or yellow is
just a very tedious process I had no
idea what actually went into making a
shade so it's super cool to see you just
learn about Kaylie's amazing thank you
for being patient only how do you tweak
the shade five billion times
thank you thank you guys for your
support there's been a lot of exciting
things happening lately and it wouldn't
be nearly as special without all of your
messages and comments and just stop so
little words so I really do appreciate
it I lay in bed for an hour every night
just reading through your comments and
responding and opening your snaps and
everything so we were you know family is
just so special and I hope it can stay
that way I love you guys and I'm going
to cry again if you do decide to
purchase 1548 I would love to see you
guys wearing it make sure you tag me on
instagram we're going to be posting some
of your photos wearing the shades I hope
you'll love it as much as I do and just
realize the look like christmas-gram
you have any questions you can leave
them down below or tweet me I love you
guys thanks for watching see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
