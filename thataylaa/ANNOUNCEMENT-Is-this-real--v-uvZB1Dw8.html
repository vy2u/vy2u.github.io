know how to start this video alright so
today we have a little announcement
video it actually feels so surreal
sitting down and actually filming this
right now
what so I had the opportunity to curate
a brush set with Sigma it's called the
freakin flawless face set I I feel like
I have so much to tell you guys not just
about like the actual brushes and what's
in here but just why this specific
collaboration with Sigma is so insane to
me let's get into that first and then
I'll get into showing you guys the
brushes even though you can all probably
guess because I've used these for years
I started my youtube channel when I was
in college I had literally a little
bathroom caddy kind of makeup thing in
my sophomore year college house and
that's what I filmed out of I had
lighting that I got from the thrift
store that was construction lighting
that made my room literally about 120
degrees and I remember one of my first
purchases that I really saved up for and
bought was the Sigma f80 flat top kabuki
brush and I went back and looked at my
old videos and I started using that
brush I have the exact same brush today
it has not fallen apart it is still
fully intact fully working not shedding
I've had that exact same brush since
2012 Sigma brushes like I've said in the
past are ones that I can 110% recommend
to you guys because the quality is
amazeballs the quality is there I've
never had a brush handle break on me I
don't have major shedding with Sigma
brushes some of my everyday brushes I've
had from them for literally years so
when Sigma reached out to see if I
wanted to make my own brush collection
it was literally a no-brainer
this is the freakin flawless face set so
you get three different brushes in here
I'm gonna show you guys so when you open
up the box inside you get a card in here
a little insert card but it says three
years of struggling with acne Sigma
brushes have been with me throughout my
entire skin journey helping me create a
canvas to feel confident I hope you love
these brushes as much as I do and they
help you embrace whatever skin you're in
and feel frickin flawless and I think
part of the reason why
collaboration is so cool to me is
because Sigma brushes have literally
been with me through my entire skin
process years of cystic acne clear skin
off and on not only through my skin
journey but through my whole YouTube
journey so that's what's on the front of
the card let me show you the actual
brushes which are also on the back of
here so the three brushes I chose
obviously Sigma f80 that was a given so
they come individually wrapped and then
we have the Sigma duo fiber f15 brush
I've talked about all these brushes for
forever on my channel and the Sigma fo3
Face highlight brush if you've seen any
of my videos you've definitely seen me
using these brushes this is a limited
edition brush set and buying the brush
that gives you guys at 15% off the
normal retail price if you buy any other
Sigma brushes on there you can still use
my coat the Tayla and you'll get 10% off
of whatever that but this will give you
15% off if you buy the whole set so
whole set is $62 for 3 brushes and the
u.s. gets free shipping the first 50
people who order
I wrote handwritten notes for you guys
so those will be in your packages if
you're one of the first 50 you'll get a
handwritten little letter so I hope you
guys enjoy that my hand was about to
fall off writing those oh by the way I
chopped off my hair extensions are out
happy Wednesday here are my three very
used ones I'm gonna hold these so you
don't hear at the crinkling this whole
time brush that is available
internationally as well as Sigma does
ship internationally and if you spend
150 you get international free shipping
these brushes are cruelty free they're
made of synthetic fibers something I
think is freaking awesome
is Sigma offers a two-year brush
warranty so if one of your brushes
breaks or if you have issues with one or
you whatever happens they do have a
two-year warranty so I think that just
speaks volumes about how confident they
are in their products as well so because
I've used these fifty thousand times I'm
pretty sure you guys know how I use each
of these brushes but I'm gonna go
through each brush but before that the
launch day is tomorrow so this videos
going up on Wednesday the brush set
launches Thursday 9 a.m. Pacific time on
Sigma's website I'm gonna have the link
added in the description box as soon as
it goes live it's not gonna be in there
right now when this video goes up
tomorrow come back to this video I'm
going to be tweeting it I'm gonna
putting it on social media to the exact
link if you want to purchase the brush
set so 9 a.m. Pacific time tomorrow's
when it launches and again the first 50
will get the hand
no in the box as well no discount code
or anything is needed you get the
automatic discount if you click through
that link all right so let's go through
these guys I did show you guys applying
them so insert some clips as I'm talking
about him so let's start out with the
Sigma f80 flat top kabuki I'll take a
new one out for you guys fresh this is a
flat top kabuki foundation brush I've
used this in probably 85% of my
foundation videos literally hundreds of
videos at this point when I go to
foundation brushes blends out my
foundation easily I can stipple it on
without getting like brush strokes
doesn't soak up a ton of foundation
great quality you don't worry about
brush hairs coming out on your face has
a nice weight to it so go to foundation
brush if you're trying to hit the Sigma
shipping minimum or something for
international shipping I also love the
hover here f82
round top kabuki also had this exact
brush for years this one I like for
blending out stick foundations this is
bond for stick foundation so if you're
trying to hit the shipping minimum or
whatever this could be another option if
you are in the market for another friend
Asian brush okay so next up we have the
Sigma fo 3 high cheekbone highlighter
brush my go-to highlighting brush ever
since this thing launched a couple years
ago I've been using it pretty much
exclusively as my highlight brush it is
so freakin soft I love this because it's
dense enough to where it's gonna give
you that pop with your highlight but
it's soft enough to where you're not
gonna get like the straight up line you
can still blend product into your face
with this use it for my cheekbone
highlight my Cupid's bow my nose and
also if I'm gonna be adding a little bit
of highlight right above my eyebrow just
on the high point of my forehead I use
it for that as well super soft great
highlight brush it's interesting how you
actually can't see a difference with
highlight brushes especially how it
applies the highlight you're gonna get a
totally different effect if you use
something like this versa it's a
flimsier brush it's just whatever
obviously you prefer but for me I like
this one because I can still get product
payoff with it but it doesn't give me
that like stripy effect and I can still
blend it in and then the third brush in
the set mine has like some kind of gunk
on it right now
lovely is the duo fiber powder / blush
brush at 15 so I kind of used this for a
few different things I'll show you guys
today how I applied it with bronzer
buddies is for a few different purposes
so if I'm using it with a bronzer I use
it if I want kind of a lighter more
diffused
there are certain bronzers that this
blush works amazing with the
bareMinerals bronzer the hourglass
bronzers anything that's a little bit
more powdery I guess you could say this
brush works awesome with because it just
gives you that really diffuse kind of
look though it's awesome for brushing
away any kind of eyeshadow fallout you
guys have seen me use it for that
multiple times and videos if you have
any kind of eye shadow fall out and you
don't want to get that obviously like
color on your face when you go to brush
it away this brush since it is duo-fiber
isn't gonna like smear the product to
basically just picks it up and fluffs it
away I also like using this brush to
just blend everything together after I
have my blush and bronzer on if it's
looking a little bit chunky or something
I always go in with my powder brush and
will like blend it out just to tone
everything down but then if I just want
to make it look even more flawless and
kind of blended I just go over
everything with this and there's
something about this brush they it just
gives you that really smooth kind of
airbrushed look on your cheeks I wanted
to include this one because I feel like
it's one of those brushes that a lot of
people probably wouldn't pick up on its
own but once you have it in your life
and you use it for different things it's
a little bit magical so I hope that some
of you guys end up really falling in
love with this brush because that's what
happened to me when I first tried this I
wasn't a big fan of duo fiber brushes
ever but there's something about this
brush over the years that has just
totally grown on me I think because I
can use it for so many different things
it just makes you look all blended so
those are all the brushes in the
freaking flawless base set I don't think
I'm ever gonna get over this I still
feel like I'm looking at something not
what it actually is so I just want to
say huge thank you to you guys for your
support over the years the fact that
some of you have literally been with me
since I was in that first Harry Potter
closet sized room in college and have
seen these brushes throughout the years
and have watched my videos throughout
the years or if you're just a newer
burrito I really appreciate all of your
guys's comments and support and
everything stuff would not be possible
without you guys and I think it's so
cool that some of you have been with me
throughout this entire whole crazy thing
that I never in a million years thought
was gonna happen so so I hope you guys
are excited again this will be available
