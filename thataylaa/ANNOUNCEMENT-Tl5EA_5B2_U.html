I'm like too excited we were here it's
Tuesday it's a bonus video and I have
something exciting to share with you
guys it's pretty sure you already know
by this point what it is but I've been
working on my own line of merch I think
I'm the only youtuber on planet earth
that has been on YouTube for like 6
years and doesn't have their own merch
out yet
the day has come so this is a permanent
babe Rito merch line right now I have
four different designs and 16 different
total styles so right now when this
video goes up it will be live the link
will be down below in the description
box is on teespring again I'll talk more
about that in a second I have a few
samples here to show you guys but
there's a bay Rideau design holy shit
C's heck yeah and freakin flawless so
I'm really excited with how the designs
turned out I want to say huge thank you
to Meghan at free flight designs she did
a killer job making these come to life
it was like exactly what I was
envisioning for each one these are all
hand-drawn designs which I loved in a
lot of time and effort went into each
designs so I'm gonna have Meghan's
website and her Instagram link down
below check her out because she's
awesome
so in the past I feel like I'm
forgetting to do something for my lights
on yeah so today spring is the platform
that I've used to do march in the past
and I've just had really great
experiences with them that's where my
storefront is on I wanted to make these
obviously available internationally so
teespring does ship to US Canada and
internationally if you're on the shop
and you see a certain design that you
like but it doesn't have the style shirt
that you want there's a lot of people in
the comments that want a certain style
product just let me know because I can
definitely make them I just didn't want
to have like 50 Styles all at once so I
have a bunch of samples right here this
was actually quite a long process change
some stuff move some stuff around so
these are not the final ones that I have
here these are just my samples I just
want to show you guys like the different
style shirts and everything on the
description for each product on key
spring I also say which size I am in
that specific style all right let's do
the classic first so this is the burrito
design right here we've got some coffee
lipstick avocado camera mascara and
obviously a burrito I think is my
favorite one
this shirt by the way this is the
slouchy fit one I wear size medium
or small this is so friggin soft this
shirt is my favorite shirt out of all of
them because you can wear it as like an
off-the-shoulder kind of thing you can
slash it over one shoulder or you can
just wear it like a normal t-shirt and
it just kind of sits up here and it's
just slouchy err so next up is the
design that I have on right now this is
the heck yeah white version this one is
in white and black and also the bay Rita
one is in white and black too and
there's like hoodies and different
styles I'm not going to go through every
single style because you can just see it
on the page but the heck yeah does come
in white and black love this one I feel
like with red lips this just looks
really cool here's the black and white
heck yeah version I love the way this
one pops with all the flowers and I'm
gonna insert some photos here too
because I did recruit a friend to help
me take photos in these I'll be posting
them on Instagram and stuff to it make
sure you follow me on Instagram because
I'm probably gonna be releasing some
more designs that when I do I'll
probably give you guys a sneak peak on
social first the Holi show sees I love
this one there's little lipsticks as the
eyes there's a black crewneck version of
this that has holy shit sees in white
really tiny in the corner that's super
cute there's also a white shirt that has
this bigger just right across the front
that says holy shit sees all these by
the way come on mugs which I do have a
mug to show you too
this is the freaking flawless design in
the slouchy one again again so soft I
love this with the black lips this one
also comes in a couple different styles
if you don't want a t-shirt right and
then lastly I have one of the mugs to
show you guys this is the burrito mug
I'm in love I've already washed this by
the way is this is what it looks like
after washed in the mug right now I have
the baby toe design the friggin flawless
and holy shit see so let me know if you
guys want the heck out on the mug too so
the way teespring works the same as in
the past if you bought a 15 days of
foundation t-shirt but they basically
ship every three days just the way they
print them and ship them they do it in
linked batches teespring is kind of
weird where it says there's like a
countdown for when the sale ends it
might say two days or whatever but
that's just the batches since they ship
every three days so even if it says it's
ending in two days don't worry it is
still available I'm sure I'm forgetting
something so everything is always down
below in the description box the link to
the shop will be down there some more
information will be down there so hell
