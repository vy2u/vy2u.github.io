than putting a vibrating sponge on your
face I don't know all right no
foundation on right now and it is first
thing in the morning and we are trying
out a vibrating sponge so this is the
Sephora sonic airbrush sponge I thought
it would be fun to do like a first
impression kind of thing on this I've
seen a lot of videos on the color rumi
automatic sponge I think this was called
like 54 bucks
I actually found this one on Sephora for
$11 it's originally $25 but they had it
marked down to 11 so I snatched it up I
feel like I would not pay $25 let alone
$54 for a rotating sponge but that's
just me going to take this out it does
come with an extra little sponge top in
here and you are supposed to take off
the sponge applicator and wash after
each use not sure how long each sponge
is supposed to last but they do give you
two in here so you just pull up this guy
so ironically I just went to read some
of the claims on safar's website and it
says that this product is no longer
available I don't know if that means
that it's like fully discontinued and
they're never bringing it back but I
asked you guys on snapchat and Twitter
if you still want to see this video and
a bunch of you said yes so I'm still
doing it today I'm super weird timing
because I was literally looking on the
website reading the claims last night
like nine hours ago even weirder I
decided for some reason last night to
screenshot it so I have the claims
sometimes when I do force impressions
will screenshot at the night before just
so I don't have to like go finding it
again the next morning so I did
screenshot the claims right here because
that's an easy-to-use vibrating brush
for a flawless application innovative
tool smoothly and evenly apply
foundation for a flawless airbrushed
look it has twelve thousand tiny dabs
per minute well it's actually a lot
flexible non-latex sponge hugs curves
around the nose and eyes oh it actually
feels like it could do that for instant
perfect application so that's pretty
much all it says as far as how to apply
it says to dab the sponge directly into
makeup
switch on the pulsation and apply to
your face apply jet
what is that sound that's apply gently
in a circular motion starting at the
center of the face and moving out press
firm and buff the product in the skin a
turn off the sponge obviously oh that is
pretty much it I haven't seen any videos
on this I have seen a bunch of videos on
The Color Me sponge and that one
actually looks like it does a pretty
legit job so I feel like there is hope
I'm going to take the YSL Touche clot
foundation in the shade BR ten did a
review on this during 15 days of
foundation and in my time it is still at
same week that 15 days foundation ended
so I'm trying out a bunch of the
foundations again to see how I like them
with different powders and stuff they
put about 2 pumps three pumps what was I
think that's three pumps I'm back here
I'm just going to dab the sponge
directly into the product on here
so it is like covered think we're going
to do the sponge on one side of my face
and a brush on the other side of my face
so I'm going to put it on my face and
then turn this on well both circular
motions right it feels very soft okay
you like that a up a ton of the
foundation turn this off and dab in
again because that didn't really cover
anything let's go in again with a little
more product
it does glide over the nose area really
nice I just feel like it's eating up on
that product so it went on fine like it
blended out easily I just feel like I'm
not getting nearly as much coverage as I
get with brush and this is pretty much
two layers now I'm just going to do my
whole forehead with the sponge so before
we do that I use a brush on the rice in
my face and I have whatever's left over
in here I'll probably need more product
but maybe not because it's the brush
feel like I just got better coverage
with like half a pump of foundation and
we did with like two full pumps on this
side yeah definitely did I'm going to
dip again to do it forehead it totally
eats it up look at that I feel like that
just rubbed it around and like so def
half of it you don't have to press super
hard to blend it now you're going to
press harder I'm getting virtually no
coverage because it is literally also be
happy in this thing I'm going to try and
like spot conceal in this tiny bit maybe
lines let's try the lines instead of
buffing now just kind of dragging what
we already put down around feels good
it's gonna like a facial massage alright
I'm super impressed this sides with like
half a layer basically looks way better
than this side with almost three so I'm
going to go ahead finish up dress my
makeup going with my brush
so here's a quick close up here's the
brush side with two layers here is the
sponge shrug with three layers as you
can see generally cover up anything in
here for head I just went over with my
brush so that's a little bit better
brush guide definitely got better
coverage soaked up less product and I
used about half the amount so the rest
of my makeup is on on my lips right now
is Oprah Angeles and I forgot how much I
like this color so overall thoughts on
this guy if you don't need a ton of
coverage I do think this blended out
fine the finish of it was totally fine
definitely a little bit more time
consuming than the brush but nothing
horrible but it does soak up I feel like
3/4 of your product even with three
layers of foundation I couldn't get the
coverage that I usually get on two
layers with the brush for me I think
this one is a pass not sure if I'll even
use this again because I don't want it
to keep eating up my foundation maybe
it's a good thing they discontinued it
