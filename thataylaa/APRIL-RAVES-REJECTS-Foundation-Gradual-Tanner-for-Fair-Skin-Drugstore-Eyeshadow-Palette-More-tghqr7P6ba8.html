Michaels I'm getting heated right now
all right so today it is April Reis and
rejects I literally just had to check my
phone to see what month it is
this is where I talk about products that
I liked this month that I didn't like
this month this is actually from the
past two months I doing raising rejects
every couple months because I feel like
a month just flies by and the products
that I include in these videos are ones
that I really have tested there's
usually nothing in these videos that
I've only been using a few times I feel
like that just I don't know that's like
my pet peeve these are ones that I
really have worn tested that I love that
I hundred percent recommend so if you're
excited for this video and you want
Ray's and rejects to continue don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up if
you're new here you can join the burrito
family and subscribe I upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific
time alright have everything in a bin
here where to start where to start I'm
actually wearing I think I'm wearing all
these products the makeup ones I'm going
to talk about let's just start out with
foundation shall we as you guys know 15
days foundation recently wrapped up I
have a whole video on my top foundations
from that series
none of those foundations are in this
video because like I said especially
with foundation if the foundation makes
it into this video like a raisin rejects
it has been one that I've been using for
a long time that I totally recommend and
I feel like I'm not quite there with
those foundations yet like they'll
probably be in future raisin rejects but
this foundation I've been testing for
since it came out so a couple months now
this is the NARS ultra radiant long wear
foundation I have the shade Montblanc
Montblanc is a pretty good shade match
for me this foundation has totally grown
on me it is full coverage I love the
coverage of this foundation it feels
pretty light like pretty lightweight but
it's full coverage and it gives you this
beautiful radiant satin matte finish
looks matte but it also looks like skin
because it has that radiance to it this
one I love on its own I love mixed in
with other foundations I'm wearing this
today mixed in with the Maybelline fit
me doing in smooth not the matte and
poreless do in smooth version is the way
to go if you have dry skin that's pretty
rare for me where I don't feel like I
have to mix foundation either because of
the shade or the formula that the
coverage or something I do like this one
on its own my only downside to with this
one is that as it wears it can look a
tiny bit heavy
throughout the day which is why I do
like mixing in just a tiny bit of
something
little bit more smoothing like the CYO
lifeproof or this guy just to really
take it to the next level but again this
is beautiful on its own too next product
is also one that I tried out a long time
ago first when it came out and it just
has been grown on me this past month
I've used this a shit-ton this is the
Fenty Beauty kilowatt highlighter a girl
next door and she creek it looks in the
pan like this would be a blush shade on
my skin tone but I have it on today I go
in with the shade right here this one is
too dark and it's a little bit too
shimmery for me but this shade right
here for what I look for in a face
highlight which is subtle and texture
like it's not gonna emphasize my pores
right there and it just gives me this
glowy beautiful light peachy a little
bit of like champagne in there kind of
glow this shade I think is beautiful for
spring actually have this shade right
here on my inner corner today so as you
can see it's kind of like a peachy pink
kind of shade so that is too much for my
skin tone wow this shade actually
matches my shirt like perfectly shout
out to t.j.maxx got this Puma shirt on
clearance for 12 bucks hell yeah I love
a good deal another product that you
guys saw 50,000 times during 15 days
foundation videos the Maybelline vivid
hot lacquer in the shade tease I love
the shade of this I'm wearing it right
now this is like my perfect light nude
where it's not too cool it's not too
warm I have a few things on right now
right now I'm wearing the maybelline
purely nude in 110 liner then I have
Sephora liquid lipstick in 33 and then I
topped it off with this we got a lot of
on the lips right now but this is
pigmented enough to the point where you
could totally just wear this on its own
I just like how it can lighten any
lipstick I have on give me that perfect
new 10th
I love the applicator it has that nice
like triangle kind of pointed applicator
to it and it just moves on it feels very
buttery the only thing I don't like
about this is that it totally transfers
to your teeth like I've already had to
blot my teeth a few times but I'll just
go with a tissue and just you know stick
it in and blot this one feels very
different depending on what you have
underneath it and what you put it on top
of that was the same thing like right
now on top of that Sephora liquid
lipstick it feels a lot more sticky than
it does if you just have this on if you
just have this on it does feel very
creamy and kind of buttery Jade is
really what sells me on this I feel like
this is like the lip gloss shade I've
been looking for my whole life a lot of
these products you guys have already
heard me talk about a shit-ton but
that's kind of the point in this video
either in here
but this is the Maybelline tattoo studio
brow gel and deep brown wait for the Sun
when you go back this is what I have on
my eyebrows right now I love the shade
of this this is like the perfect dark
brown shade in my opinion it's not too
red it's not too dark it's not too light
long story short the formula of this
rocks the packaging and the whole
concept does not this should not be in a
brow gel kind of applicator I think what
they should have done is put it in kind
of a squeeze tube packaging like the
makeup revolution brow product or the
next one where you just squeeze it out
and then you dip your brush in the best
way to apply this is to take this out
and to just go in straight with your
angled eyebrow brush and just get some
of that on there and then go in and do
your brows like you normally would with
like a dip brow kind of product that's
the best way to apply this if you go in
straight with this applicator you're
gonna have so much product on your brows
it's gonna be way too intense gonna be
really hard to work with just not the
right packaging for this formula but the
actual formula is amazeballs it lasts
all day it literally will stay on if you
don't wash your face with like soap or
an oil or something like if you're going
swimming or it's raining or something
and you're worried about your brows like
sliding off this stays on it's supposed
to be waterproof for two days I
obviously have not tested that for two
days but I have tested it when I first
use this in the shower and I didn't put
any kind of my soaps or oils or anything
on and it stayed on throughout the
shower so I would say this is waterproof
so this will be a great one for this
summer next up is this first day beauty
ultra Repair Cream intense hydration I
have used so much of this about a third
of this since I got it I haven't used
this on my face because I'm just too
stuck in my way with my current skincare
routine that has been working really
well for me so I haven't tried this on
my face yet but what I love this for is
eczema on my body I got eczema from
accutane and it kind of goes off and on
and I swear by this thing ton of you
guys actually recommended this in the
comments of a certain video can't
remember which one it was I think I was
talking about eczema on my hands and
there were like literally 50 comments
about this product for eczema you guys
were spot on because this thing works
for eczema I put it on my chest my arms
at the back of my hands and if I have
eczema at night and I put this on in the
morning
is gone if you have really sensitive
skin and you haven't found something
that helps the eczema and you don't
really want to use like a steroid cream
or something I often out of that because
I just felt like there's probably some
kind of lotion or something I could use
and I'm really happy I did because this
is amazing for eczema the only thing I
do not like about this is the scent it
smells so bad to me it smells like a wet
bathing suit like exactly like a wet
bathing suit that's been like sitting in
a plastic bag for like two days the
consistency is actually pretty
lightweight it doesn't feel quite like a
gel moisturizer but it's definitely not
like a thick moisturizer so it's good
for the body for that reason it's not
like a thick body butter anything and it
absorbs into your skin really nicely I
just I would not use this during the day
because I don't want to smell like wet
clothes I feel like one of my most asked
questions is about bronzers for pale
skin and let me know if you guys want to
see a whole video on my top bronzer
recommendations I do have one about
contour shades and goes into like a few
bronzers in that video too but maybe
I'll do kind of an updated one and
slowly just bronzer products I kind of
use bronzers and contour interchangeably
just depending on what I'm going for
that day today I don't have on any kind
of contour product I'm just wearing this
bronzer which I'm going to talk about
which is actually not technically a
bronzer this is a face powder a powder
foundation this is the bare minerals
Barre Pro satine 0-5 so this is a powder
foundation but the shade of this is
perfect for a super natural bronzer if
you have very fair-skinned just adds a
little bit of life and color to your
skin I have a tiny bit on my temples too
but still looks really really natural it
doesn't look to oranjee I have on kind
of a peachy blush right now which we'll
talk about it you might be like seeing
some of that but as far as the actual
bronzer tone it is not too warm not too
cool it's just like a fair kind of
neutral tone if your skin tone is any
darker than mine it probably won't show
up enough as a bronzer but if you're
around my skin tone or lighter then I
think this could be a beautiful bronzer
shade for you sometimes with fair skin
you just got to make it work like I use
certain eyebrow products for my contour
shades and then certain face powders for
bronzers because most brands don't make
bronzer is fair enough or the right tone
for fair skin
just got to kind of hack the system you
know I'm saying I also like the
Maybelline fit me this isn't a favor in
this video but just to show you kind of
a shade comparison here this is the
Maybelline fit me powder in 310 which
I'm pretty sure I talked about in that
contour video and then here's the
bareMinerals one so you can see side by
side so this one's a little bit more
neutral this one's a tiny bit more warm
alright this little guy is the cutest
face mask ever this is the nug face mask
soothing it's s it has shea butter and
chamomile extract if you have dry skin
you need this I got about four uses out
of this little pod thing so you actually
get a decent amount in here it's way too
much to just do one time with you could
at least get two or three uses out of
this but this really plumped my skin
moisturised it I was going through a
phase a few weeks ago where I was
getting some major like dry patches down
here and this you can see a difference
after you wash it off I feel like it's
very moisturizing and it is kind of
soothing on the skin I've gone through a
couple of these so I've used this about
eight times now since I got about four
uses out of each one and I'm definitely
gonna be repurchasing these because I
feel like my skin just really liked it
probably saw this coming so recently did
kind of a full face look using all my
current favorite drugstore makeup so
I'll link that video in the iron down
below but in that video I used the
Milani new eyeshadow pellets try not to
blend you guys this is bold obsessions
and then most loved mattes you can get
these for 20 bucks Emma Lonnie's website
but if you get them in store at Walmart
you can get them for 15 dollars I guess
pellets are gorgeous like I said in that
video definitely one of my favorite
drugstore eyeshadow palettes that has
ever launched both the most loved mattes
and the bold obsessions palette they're
pigmented they're soft they blend out I
have it on my eyes right now I like that
you can get kind of a cool toned look
with this too using some of these more
purple tone shades and I have on this
kind of taupe gray shimmery shade right
there and then I put on the Stila
glitter and diamond dust over top that's
all the kind of silvery glitter you're
seeing but I just love how my eye shadow
turns out every time I use these
palettes everything about these from the
packaging they look like Tarte pallets
to the formula to how heavy it is just
super nice quality I think it's gonna be
hard for someone to top these especially
for 15 bucks these are better than a lot
of
i n pellets I've tried and a few
high-end pellets that are in the rejects
part of this video well we're on the ice
object-- two pairs of lashes that you
guys have seen me talk about again
50,000 times recently is the kiss /
couture foaming collection in gala I
have these on my eyes right now
beautiful drugstore lashes if you want
really voluminous really intense but
still kind of separated a little bit and
wispy I just love the way these making
my eyes look I feel like they just take
any kind of look to the next level the
thing I love about these lashes is that
the band is actually not very thick at
all for how many lashes how many hairs
are in here I don't know how they did it
because usually if you have a pair of
lashes like this the base is a little
bit thicker and the band on these are
very comfortable they don't feel too
heavy they're not like the pure or the
eye lower bands which I don't mind those
are some of my favorite lashes but these
definitely feel a lot more lightweight
even though they are super dramatic and
super voluminous so if you're not
someone who likes the aisle or bands you
might like these ones better another one
which you guys saw in the wet-and-wild
cushion foundation video and definitely
a few other videos during 15 days of
foundation was the Isle or accents 0:05
so they're just kind of side accent
lashes these give you that really pretty
kind of natural cat eye to the point
where you could wear these just with a
little bit of liner and it just really
makes your eyes kind of pop it just
makes your eyes look bigger and more
open it just looks really flattering and
the bands on these are thinner than the
usual aisle or ones so they don't have
to think of a lash band I do trim them
down a little bit but I just find myself
reaching for these a lot if I'm doing a
look where I don't want a super dramatic
lash like this one so this next one is a
surprise to me because sinful colors
nail polish in the past for me has been
very very cheap it kind of flakes off it
chips really easy so I was not expecting
to like this as much as I do this is the
sinful colors quick dry professional
topcoat this is a balm topcoat you guys
so I had shellac on my nails for forever
like I think the last year up until the
Europe trip and drew it one day
Europe in January so since January I've
just been painting my own nails I
haven't gotten back and gotten shellac
and I've just been having fun switching
it up and putting different colors on
especially in the spring for years I
used the Sally Hansen and want to say
it's called the quick dry top coat it's
in that like silver metallic bottle
that's the top coat I've been using for
forever and I was just finding that my
nail polish was chipping so quickly like
within a couple days it wasn't staying
on it wasn't drying down super quickly
goes on the hunt for new topcoat and
this for a few bucks is amazing this
makes my nails dry super-quick I don't
have to worry about messing them up
right after I painted them I did these
this morning and literally after about
10 minutes after I applied this my nails
were totally fine to do my normal things
it makes my nails super shiny I feel
like they chip a lot slower now my nail
polish just last longer and it dries
super quickly so all around definitely
feeling this topcoat next up is the
blush I have on right now this is the
Milani baked powder blush in the shade
Rosa romantica Romantica I don't know
I'm totally blanking of the name of the
super popular Milani blush that's that
like peachy shade that everyone loves I
want to say the luminoso that sounds
right you know what I'm talking about
there's just one blush shade by Milani
that a lot of people love and it's
always looked way orangie on my skintone
but this shade looks so beautiful if you
like a glowy blush I think I see it has
quite a bit of a glow to it but I feel
like it looks more intense on my finger
right now then it does on my face it
doesn't emphasize stuff it doesn't look
too shimmery it gives my face a nice
glow and I feel like this is gonna be
such a pretty blush for the summer ok
another nail polish should have
mentioned that with the topcoat this is
the julep nail polish in the shade Carla
I feel like this has been the polish
shade I have been looking for I wanted
that light almost white kind of pinky
shade and I feel like a lot of the
classics like OPI bubble bath and that
one Essie one bride something those ones
always look too pink and a little bit
dark on my hands on my skin tone and so
this one is actually light enough to
where it looks just like a really pretty
milky kind of light pink add a little
bit of lavender in there so I love the
shade works really well that topcoat and
jewel polish just always lasts on my
nails really well too so you guys know
my self-tanner days are pretty much over
they have been for a few years but when
the sun's start
coming out and you just want a little
bit of color I've been using this on my
legs because my legs are actually
lighter than the rest of my body and
this is just a super natural super
gradual tanner this is the tan luxe the
gradual illuminating gradual tan lotion
I don't find this to be illuminating at
all like at all but it's basically a
super liquidy I think you guys can see
it in there super liquidy lotion like it
kind of pours out into your hands so you
have to be careful not to get too much
but the thing I like about this is that
a lot of things it doesn't transfer it
doesn't smell horrible it's pretty
impossible to streak and you just apply
it like a lotion so you don't need to
really worry about anything that you
typically do with Tanner's it's not
gonna like transfer to your clothes it
doesn't have a color guard or anything
you can put on clothes literally about
five or ten minutes after putting this
on it dries super quick and just kind of
absorbs into your skin which is why I
think it's so watery it really doesn't
feel like a thick kind of goopy lotion
at all it just really absorbs dries down
and then you wake up or you can put on
in the morning and like wear it
throughout the day
and you have a little bit of color to
your body it doesn't fade weird it
doesn't get like patchy when it fades
you don't need to scrub anything off it
just literally fades away so I just feel
like if you're looking for a super
low-maintenance mess-free
gradual tanner this one is great you can
get this on Sephora by the way I
recently did a video on my top powders
to set foundation and this one has
definitely been a huge favorite the past
you know a few months now this is the
Sephora micro smooth powder in the shade
light 0-5 this is like if you want an
easy natural-looking powder that gives
you a little bit of coverage doesn't
take away the coverage when you set the
rest of your foundation has the most
beautiful satin finish doesn't look
powdery this is great it just looks very
lightweight on the skin I like using my
usual for less cb4 brush to apply this
and it just works with any foundation
I've tried it with it doesn't make my
dry skin look too powdery which is the
thing so I've been feeling this powder a
lot alright so last three for the month
is actually a powder that I discovered
in the wish app video this is the major
pressed powder I've talked about this
quite a bit recently it's what I've been
using to set my under eyes a clearly hit
pan on it I mix this in with my darker
Physicians Formula powder I'll link it
down below too but that's what I
on right now to set my under eyes and if
you have fair skin and need an under eye
setting powder look no further I do like
this better than the stargazer white
powder I used to use because it is so
much softer this is like a buttery soft
powder it does have a white almost like
yellow tint to it so this isn't for all
skin tones for sure and you might need
to mix it if you're around my skin tone
if your fairer than me and you've had
major struggles finding either an
all-over face powder or an under eye
setting powder this one is so beautiful
I want to say it was a couple bucks on
the wish app I know people have a lot of
opinions on the wish app so just buy at
your own discretion like with anything
else but I feel like it wouldn't make
sense to not mention this because I've
literally been using it every single day
and it's been working really well for me
for my under eyes okay let's move on to
the rejects bin here I've got a lot of
rejects folks hey let's just start with
this because it's right on top so if
you're into like the Korean skincare
world at all this is a product that's
really liked overall it seems like this
is the face shop rice water bright light
cleansing oil so essentially it's just
an oil kind of makeup remover cleanser
and it does take off my makeup I hate
the film that this leaves on afterwards
and the scent is the big no for me with
this one it is so heavily scented ooh
that just squirted out on my shirt I'm
gonna stain it no no it seriously smells
like a perfume like a straight-up
perfume it is so heavily scented which
kind of shocked me because surprised I
wasn't reading more reviews about the
scent because to me it's like not
something that I want to put on my face
fragrance can really irritate your skin
and this is like what's gonna knock you
out strong next up is the urban decay
backtalk palette basically you get a
side with a couple kind of highlighters
right here maybe like a glowy blush and
then you get a couple blushes and then
on this other side you have a shadows
here this packaging is so freakin
obnoxious so what happens is you open it
and if you open it right the mirror
stays right there but what usually ends
up happening is the mirror falls out
dings your products this mirror
comes completely out and the more
frustrating thing is that if you don't
want the mirror in there and you don't
want it ding in all of your products you
can't close this thing there's no
magnetic closure right here there's
obviously the gap where them you're
supposed to be I feel like just the
whole design of this product is pretty
shitty interesting idea but not very
practical I hate that you have to worry
about it digging your shadows and that
if you don't want the mirror in there
you can't close it and then the actual
eye shadows in here are just not Urban
Decay's best formula I don't know what
happened with this formula but it's
definitely different and I actually find
the blush shades are easier to work with
for eye shadows than the actual eye
shadows so overall this one is just this
isn't No
so next up is a powder that I tried in a
drugstore try on haul video this is the
NYX holographic halo finishing powder
now this would be one thing if this was
a face highlight but this is literally a
purple blue highlight marketed as a
finishing face powder I do not
understand it I think the only situation
that this would work as a face powder is
if you were doing like Halloween makeup
and you're trying to be a mermaid or an
alien or something I'm all into glowy
face powders just not when they turn
your face blue purple I have a lot of
face powders here actually and these
aren't all the face butters I've been
trying these are just the ones that in
my opinion we're like extra worthy of
being shitty and in this pile so this
one is the dietary hyaluronic hydra
powder I know a lot of people like this
powder I was stoked to try this for my
dry skin hyaluronic acid is typically
really good for dry skin but this I feel
like made my skin look so dry just
chalky overall not good and this is
obviously just a little sample travel
kind of size and I'm really glad I got
the size it doesn't feel hydrating to me
at all and it just made me look like
gross and chalky and dry another powder
here this is the Lancome absolute
absolute powder that cost me a friggin
arm and a leg this isn't the shade
absolute pêche so I purchased this
because if you guys messaged me saying
that Jacqueline Hale used this in her
kind of glowy foundation routine video
and you
no I love my glowy powders I love any
kind of illuminating setting powder
that's like the best of both worlds for
me because you get to set your
foundation but it still gives you that
glow so I wouldn't watched her video and
then I purchased this jacqueline skin
looked beautiful nothing against her her
video or anything just this product for
my skin looked absolutely horrendous
it was so glowy to the point where it
literally looked like I did that
highlighter challenge where I just put
highlighter all over my face this is a
glowy glowy
powder I use this as an all-over kind of
setting powder I've tried it with
fluffier brushes I've tried it with my
usual denser face powder brushes I've
tried it just on the high points of my
face it just looks it looks rough on my
skin and this is just a prime example of
how different products can work
differently for people and this is not a
cheap powder I think this was around $60
maybe like $62 so I definitely will be
returning this ok still have more face
powders in here but let's give that a
break for a second and talk about and
eyeshadow palette I've been trying this
for months now I want to say like maybe
the one how long 3 months 2 months
trying to make it work I've been trying
to make it work because this palette is
so hyped up busy are as a brand their
eyeshadow palettes are so hyped up my
whole visi art journey started out with
the petite pro mini palette honestly
feels and looks like crap to me this is
plastic right here these are pretty
scratchy pretty chalky not super
pigmented and I said that in another
video and some of you guys were like you
got to check out their normal palettes
the mini palettes aren't as good as
their normal palettes so that's why I
purchased this thing this is the neutral
matte palette I actually got this off of
glambot so I did not have to pay full
price for this thing thank God
the tones in here I was stoked about
because I love cool tone matte shades
I've been really into them lately I feel
like they just really made green eyes
pop especially shades like this I have
tried to like it I want to like it I
don't like it at all so I went on
Twitter to see what you guys thought of
this palette those of you who have used
it and I am so glad I'm not alone here I
was actually shocked how many people
also didn't like this palette but
consensus is that a ton of you guys
also don't like
the Formula D so what I don't like about
this let's actually talk about the
pallet now they just shout on an antenna
is that they're not soft they feel so
dry to me they feel so dry and chalky
and they look way better on finger
swatches right now than they do on the
eyes I just feel like I have to work
with these so much more than some of my
other shadows this is a pricey palette
this palette is $80 there is no way in
hell I think this is worth $80 I'm
getting heated right now I honestly
would not pay $10 for this palette I
would rather pay $80 for this Milani
palette than I would the Vizier palette
don't think is worth your money I'm
underwhelmed I don't love how my shadow
looks and I feel like I just have to
work so much harder for it to look good
yeah no you guys saw me rant about these
in one of the days of 15 days foundation
but these are the are Dell magnetic
lashes I have the normal ones here which
I obviously haven't used this pair I've
tried it the accent ones and then I also
tried double demi whispies cool concept
cool concept lash glue irritates me so I
was actually really stoked to try these
I've tried to apply these multiple times
now and I definitely feel like it gets
easier the more you apply them but I
still don't like these at all so
basically they have top and a bottom you
kind of stick whichever one you want to
do first I think it's easier to put the
top on so you just kind of let it chill
there which is also really hard because
it has to stay in the place that you
want it at the same time that you're
holding it and then trying to match up
these magnets between your natural
lashes so once you actually get them on
25 minutes later they just look
ridiculous they didn't fade these out
enough so it just looks like it's like
no lashes and then lash it just doesn't
look right and then the other thing I
don't like about these is that there's
obviously actual magnets on here so they
feel quite heavy to me on my eyes which
I actually find to be more irritating
the weight of it then just wearing lash
glue with like lighter lashes I feel
like every time you blink it's just like
you're lifting ten pounds your eyes are
like doing Jillian Michaels I definitely
wouldn't say these are for beginners I
don't think they're any easier any more
comfortable I would just stick with
normal lashes so another face powder
I've had this one in my collection for a
while
this is the NARS all day luminous powder
foundation in the shade Siberia so since
I've had dry skin I was really excited
to try this out again because the sound
of it all day luminous sounds great
this powder to me does not look luminous
in the slightest it also is supposed to
be a powder foundation and it has a
barely any attempt to it when you blend
it out it's pretty sheer on the skin so
I wouldn't really call it a powder
foundation if anything it's like a very
sheer light coverage powder foundation
doesn't look smooth at all and it
definitely doesn't look luminous so I
would just pass on this powder if you've
been curious about it this is a Mac
sponge which looks a little questionable
but you have this round side you have
this pointy side this sponge was pretty
shitty it's too kind of porous you can
actually see the pores in the sponge
where it just soaks up everything does
not blend out your foundation well at
all I tried this side for a concealer
cuz the point I was like oh that could
be nice for concealer just soaks
everything up it almost gives you like
the sponge texture on your face so this
Mac sponge is a know for sure wow I
really have a lot of powders in here so
next powder is the Becca Hydra myth set
and refresh powder I did a whole video
on this powder where I wore it for the
full day the big thing I don't like
about this is just how much it darkens
it darkens I did try this after that
video with a sponge kind of like
pressing it in same thing happened it
does not look good on my skin I really
like the chilling sensation so that's
cool how cold it feels if you want to
know my full thoughts on it check out
that video a lot of people really like
this powder so just keep that in mind
and my last reject of the last couple
months is the essence luminous matte
bronzing powder
it says lighter skin on here so for
bronzer for lighter skin this is orange
it looks a lot better in the pan when
it's on the face it looks straight-up
orange I don't know why it's so hard for
brands to not make orange bronzers
especially when it's marketed for a
lighter skin like this one is we don't
need the orange alright so those were
all of my raves and rejects for the past
couple months I hope you guys enjoyed
this video if you
don't forget to give it a thumbs up let
me know down below what your favorite
and least favorite products were down
below if you've tried any of the things
that I've mentioned let me know what you
thought of them too just because a
product was a reject for me it could
very well be a rave for you I feel like
I have a crap ton of random like
lifestyle kind of favorites things I
found on Amazon recently so let me know
if you guys want a separate video on
kind of my top Amazon products or just
things I use that aren't makeup and
beauty related I love you guys thanks
