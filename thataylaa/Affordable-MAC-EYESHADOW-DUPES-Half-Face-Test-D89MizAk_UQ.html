whipped out the fall candle I feel like
it's officially fall I'm just pretending
like it is but today I thought we'd do a
cool-toned kind of look for fall I mean
I don't know I think you can wear
whatever you want year-round do you
but today I'm super excited because I
have a ton of mac juice for you guys I
did half of my face in Mac products and
then the other half in carroty carroty
is a brand that basically has super
affordable blendable dupes for high-end
brands like Mac and Urban Decay these
retail for 450 a pan which is a freakin
steal and if you buy the Mac shadows
like this in the little pot there are
sixteen dollars you can get the Mac pans
for cheaper for 450 you're getting
pretty much the same thing you guys will
see really don't think you can tell
which side is which the quality is there
with these Kara do is cool enough to
partner with me on this video so if you
guys want to save some money I'm gonna
leave a discount code down below along
with the links so you can check
everything out and the rest of my face
is also affordable drugstore products
all of my opinions like always are
completely my own if I recommend
something that I don't like at the end
of the day it looks bad on me so you
guys know my deal with sponsored videos
so half iMac half eye caridy I wish you
guys swatches of each shade as well
let's get into the video
say that it feels right
so right s'alright s'alright I'm just
going got the coffee let's pin back the
hair do have a little bit more like blue
cool tones in my hair which I really
like talked all about what I used on
snapchat but is this color wash thing
that's freaking awesome I'll link it
down below I have already done my
foundation and I used maybelline
superstay foundation which is one of my
old time favorites haven't used this in
forever so I whipped it out today in to
lighten it I mixed in a little bit of
the Tarte shape tape concealer that took
me ten times the same so that's the only
not affordable thing in this whole video
I just had to do that to get my
foundation to match my body that's us on
the face let's jump into the eyes I'll
be using Mac bear study Paint Pot on one
I 2 prime and then I have two options
for semi-closed oops this is the
Maybelline barely beige color tattoo and
then I also have the BH Cosmetics smooth
canvas and all these look pretty similar
the bear study has a little bit more of
a rosy tone to it
both these Maybelline and Mac products
are slightly dried out so we'll see how
this goes
need to like mix in eye drops or
something let's do Mac on this side and
I'm going to do a Ford Bowl on this side
this is super dry so I'm just warming
this up between my fingers a little bit
I personally love Mac Paint Pots to
prime the eyes I usually like soft ochre
or painterly just because it's matte but
I don't have a matte dupe for the Paint
Pot so that's why we're going in with
shimmery right now but it's fine so
we're just gonna be applying shadow over
top to bring this up right below the
brow bone since it is a nice kind of
highlight shade so going with the color
tattoo by Maybelline on this side so I'm
going to turn it off with Mac's soft
brown which is like a cult Mac classic
and then I nod you nod on this side of
my face taking a not taking I nod is
this a word I should know and I'm wiping
off product in between on my brush but
I'm not gonna be switching brushes I
just feel like kind of excessive I'm
going to go in with Mac cork and the
carroty dupe is muzzle taking a more
compact blending brush
I'm just going to place this kind of in
the crease just to add a little bit of
dimension taking muzzle now so I'm using
night divine on my Mac side typically
with lid colors lately I like to place
it with the brush just so I can get more
precise application and then go in with
my finger and kind of tap more product
on just to get the full pigment is that
thunder there's like major rain thunder
going on right now man these nails
little rough and I'm going to take my
finger and just pack some more color
right on top going in with wrath boo
this one is actually more pigmented feel
like I'm getting the same effect with
this with a brush as I did with the Mac
one with my finger this is super nice
and like metallicky if you have a little
bit of hooded lids like I do I feel like
sometimes when I go like this it looks
different than when I'm actually
relaxing my eyes it's always helpful to
just relax your eyes and see where the
product falls and if you want it higher
or lower I'm gonna take wrath on my
finger even though I feel like we don't
really need to heck yeah
super pretty color now I'm going to take
Mac and bark and then the carroty dupe
which is temptress name just gonna place
this on the outer V I'm just going to
kind of pack it on there and then we'll
blend with an empty blending brush I
think this one temptress is actually
more pigmented too
I'm just taking that first brush I used
this is the morphe r39 first I'm going
to super lightly blend embark into the
gray shade and I'm just using a really
light hand with this so it doesn't look
muddy coffee time so no idea how this
one is going to look but I kind of want
to take nylon and moonshine and put this
on just the center of my eye to get like
that pop
okay this is actually just adding a
really nice like reflect right in the
center doesn't look too light it's just
making it like a lighter gray look at
that going in with moonshine heck yeah
okay these are giving literally an
identical yeah
they look identical I'm gonna take my
finger and just add a little bit more of
each right on the center so for the
lower lash line I'm going to going with
some mac soft brown and inaud we're just
gonna call it a nod I don't want to
blend this all the way in today I'm just
going to keep it kind of on the outer
half with a super smoky eye like this
it's easy to get kind of closed off so
I'm just gonna keep it on the outer half
to keep my eyes looking open I'm gonna
take a little bit of embark putting this
literally just on the very outer part
not bringing it as far in a soft brown
and temptress so right on this lower
inner corner right here I'm going to go
back in with nylon and the dupe and
moonshine hmm look at that I feel like I
need just a little something-something
to blend more in the crease I'm going to
go back in with quark I'd say out of all
these shadows cork has the most fall out
none of the other ones either Mac or
carrot II had any fall out I'm going to
go in with my Holy Grail Physicians
Formula I booster in ultra black for
liner I actually don't have math
blackjack or anything or also would have
done that but we're just going to go in
with some affordable products for the
rest of the look I feel like these look
literally identical I'm going to do a
close-up at the end so you guys can see
we're going to thin coat of mascara
using Maybelline lash sensational and I
am going to be using falsies today but
you could totally skip out on that I
ordered softbox lighting which I'm super
excited for it should make the lighting
on point I don't really want to add
anything to the waterline today so I'm
just going to go in with actually no
first we're going to go with falsies
then I'm going to put on
bottom mascara but while the mascaras
drying let's bronze up the face a little
bit muses Maybelline master contour and
the shade 10 we might just use this for
blush and bronzer I waiting for my
brushes so ever since the Dollar Tree
makeup challenge video that I did this
brush has been my jam super soft just
blends really well like this side of my
face always applies contour better and
go with the blush shade in the same
palette and just apply a little bit this
I really like this blush shade it's like
a super pretty rosy color this color pop
super shock cheek highlight and
flexitarian this is one of their new
highlighters it is so freaking pretty
I'm usually not into cream highlighters
at all but there's something about this
oh my god
oh my god do you see that it blends out
really nicely on my skin and just gives
the prettiest glow
okay I think we are ready for falsies
I'm doing with these are Dells 600
blacks these are kind of hard to find
only remember we're actually into
finding these I think Sally Beauty but a
lot of the drug stores don't carry this
one for some reason
super fluttery and separated I'm just
gonna make sure you cut these yeah well
this eyelash is talking talking while
this eyelash is drying let's talk about
life so I'm going to be going to Idaho
the 18th pre-recording a shit-ton right
now I filmed like 6 videos this week to
have videos go up this month is freaking
crazy later in the month I'm going to
beautycon with Mallory Mallory 17/12
love her super excited we're gonna be a
beauty con October 1st and then I'm
pretty sure we're going to be doing a
meet-up the night before so make sure
you're following me on all the social if
you're in the New York area I would love
to meet you guys do a little burrito
meetup situation ok falsies are on and
then I just put on some bottom lash
mascara and then also went over the band
with the eyeliner just to cover up any
blue and things and now we're going to
go in for lips this is the NYX lip
lingerie what is this embellishment this
is like a super grayish kind of taupe
it's probably not talk well I'm putting
on liquid lipstick I think one of my
most frequently asked questions is how I
apply lipstick with the lip ring and
literally all I do is move it over and
then use the tip alright so this is the
final look if you guys like this video
make sure you give it a thumbs up like
always all the products will be listed
in the description box down below along
with a character discount code if you
want to check anything out I'm gonna
show you guys a close-up of the makeup
right now but they look identical say
that it feels right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
