more exciting than usual I know that's
what you're thinking this is a brand new
tag that Kendall ray or Kendall's place
and I came up with which I think awesome
and I will explain why it is the Amazon
fire Bay attack basically what we're
doing is we're going to be going through
our Amazon purchase history which let me
tell you is embarrassing and
we're going to explain whether you
should buy it or bail it so basically it
gives you guys a chance to see what we
purchased and at the same time gives you
guys kind of a mini review on something
that you might want to buy off of Amazon
pre-warning I'm a shopping online addict
whenever I tell you guys that I am not
kidding you will see you now we have
proof so this is kind of a collab video
with Kendall I'm going to leave all of
her info down below just a quick little
background um I genuinely love Kendall's
channel
I remember watching her when she had 200
subscribers and she's one of those
people that I just looked at and I knew
that she was going to succeed on YouTube
because she was being herself and it was
enjoyable to watch she's just a very
genuine person she makes you laugh she's
fun to watch she's really cool like DIY
videos so when I'm doing this collab I'm
honestly saying go check out her channel
because I don't think he will be
disappointed and subscribe if you like
it
okay so if my voice sounds shaky it's
because I'm freaking freezing because my
house is like Antarctica right now
I'm currently on 2011 it had to kind of
zoom in because it has all of my
personal information on this page but
here is 2011 and then we're just kind of
kind of moved forward so we're starting
off with lie to me it was $12 and 19
cents yes Amazon is amazing for
getting cheap DVDs so that was a buy
moving on we have this is that from my
lip I don't even remember I don't even
know if I ever got that it was four
dollars and 22 cents and we have the
answer key to my Arabic book because
clearly I'm a really good student and
yeah apparently I was really into lip
rings this year then we have a book for
one of my classes and this Bell dawn
patrol
LED headlight for a bike that I rode
literally one time in my whole life I'm
gonna skip all the phone stuff because
as you will see I went on a phone
shopping spree on Amazon and it's really
unintended gold shave powder okay people
this was 492 freshman year of college I
had this brilliant idea that because my
hair is blonde and I can't get lasered I
will just get a shaving powder that is
marketed for african-american bald men I
don't know where that sounded like a
good idea but it did in my head so I
bought it off Amazon freshman year in
the dorms go to use the shaving
powder literally smelled like sulfur
throughout all four of the floors of my
dorm praise who were living in the hall
called the mechanical guys or whatever
its called
and they thought there was a chemical
leak in the building so I had to admit
that no in fact it was just a little
white girl trying to use an
african-american bald man shaving powder
on her legs and oh great apparently I
got the extra strength kind to so that's
wonderful if you're wondering they did
they did work they just smell clearly
absolutely insane and we have some
L'Oreal Paris tinted self-tanning lotion
this stuff is pretty good not my
favorite Sun Goddess is my favorite I
would have to say bail
mooom hair removal kit is freaking
amazing it's a natural waxing kit it's
sugar-based so when you pull it off it
doesn't hurt this is awesome it was ten
dollars and 77 cents I would definitely
say buy on this one then we have a bunch
of textbooks for classes one and only
argan oil I still have this exact same
bottle it was nine dollars and
seventy-five cents for this big bottle I
know Sally sells it so I don't know if
it's actually cheaper on Amazon so I
don't know buy or Bale it's up to you
but the treatment is awesome
okay the next few things are interesting
beware my roommate is like deathly
afraid of bugs so I think I got it for
her as a joke one year for her birthday
it was one dollar and 11 cents so you
can't be that for a bug vacuum and then
for my other roommate I got a beer hat
yeah no words I hope I didn't get the
same roommate the flash because that
would be calling her like a raging
alcoholic
it runs yes i ordered a neat runs off of
amazon i ate this stuff every single day
freshman year of college this was like
my ramen it is so good though gonna go
with bye for that one cat ears thumb
duck indoor outdoor party string lights
in case you want to hang some ducks off
of your balcony don't even know where
those are so this is the ring that I
still wear every single day I love it
Palm Beach jewelry has some really cool
jewelry so go check them out on Amazon
if you're interested well it not really
interesting um this looks like
straight-up porn right here but you know
it's just a self-adhesive bra these are
awesome if you're wearing like a
strapless thing or a dress or something
with like a really open back they're
self-adhesive so you just like stick
them onto your boob and if you press
hard enough they don't come off
this was $13.48 I think it came with
like
two of them though or something I still
have it so if you need that I would say
buy I've tried every freaking
self-tanner on the market this is Jan
Tan Jan Tana Ghent Anna face and body
bronzer I think this is one of those
just that just gives you bronze color I
don't remember how I liked it but
clearly not enough if I don't use it
still this was twenty three dollars and
forty three cents and I'm gonna say bail
and then like I said you know went to
extreme lakes links for the self-tanner
and got some pro tan this is for like
bodybuilders and but it works like
it's really brown you not the most
natural looking tan okay moving on to
2012 over here Jillian Michaels
love this woman this is her 30 Day Shred
DVD it was eight dollars in nineteen
cents so if you're like me and hate
going to the gym and don't want to spend
money on a gym membership try jillian
michaels she is amazing I love her DVD
it's like a 20-minute intensive workout
so I would have to say bye for Jillian
even know what this is some kind of
electronic thing I feel like my dad just
bought it and used my Amazon account I
don't know fake bake this was first 1632
which is a really good price
I think Ulta I want to say with retails
for like $24 this is a self tanner if
you didn't know if you're going to buy
it I would say buy it off Amazon because
it's gonna be cheaper but it's not my
favorite self tanner I had ever used so
I would have to say bail once again
don't know answer key second year in a
row guys yeah this is my life we have a
shading blending I brush for 968 which
why did I buy that you can get it off
eBay for like $2 Orientalism can you
tell what my major is buy all these
books comment down below if you can The
Hunger Games because who doesn't love
some freakin Jennifer Lawrence in the
forest now we're moving on to 2013 so
this is my new camera it's the GE x 600
I've gotten a few questions
it has amazing zoom it was $160 I think
that's a really good
for a camera with this kind of quality
if you do tutorials or something where
you need up close I would go with it but
I do not like the way that the audio
sounds it sounds like I'm like really
far away when I'm talking into the
camera overall if you need a high
quality camera with video I would say
buy it then Google chromecast I got this
for my dad for Hanukkah why the prices
the price for that is not showing up oh
because I used a gift card has anyone
else used to gift card to buy someone
else's present you guys are just
learning so much about me my voice is
like cracking right now I sound like I'm
a teenage boy anyways this is really
awesome
I think it was around $30.00 like I said
the price isn't showing up but basically
it's like Apple TV but in the thumb
drive and way better and cheaper I would
say buy it
50 shades darker got this for four
dollars and 71 cents my local bookstore
was selling it for $12 so obviously had
to go with Amazon on this one and then
we have a droid because I dropped my
iPhone in the toilet let me tell you
this droid is the biggest piece of
I have ever seen in a phone like I don't
know how people ever survived off of
joys this is like total first world
problems but seriously compared to the
iPhone it is like not even comparable
and I got these vintage Wayfarer style
sunglasses
aka plastic ass Wayfarers and they were
295 I just got him for my Audrey Hepburn
Halloween costume then I clearly did a
little bit of a purchase over here on
August 28th I bought the studio kabuki
face brush from ELF
buy it it's amazing and cheap then I got
this white glossy hard case for my Mac
Book 13-inch the total for all of this
was 30 dollars and 37 cents if that
tells you anything but it doesn't tell
me how how much each product was Real
Techniques blush brush definitely a buy
I use this as an all-over face powder
brush and it's my favorite brush for
this that I
that was the Amazon buyer bail tag so

you want to do the tag tweet me your

below but feel free to do the tag is to
