vodka for this video
all right so today I am putting things
on my face including the brand new most
controversial palette of 2017 the
Anastacio Beverly Hills subculture
eyeshadow palette I'm doing like a full
face get ready with me thing trying out
this palette and a few other new things
that are new to me and just some other
stuff I'm putting this up as like a
bonus video this week for you guys
because I know a bunch of you have been
asking my thoughts on this purchase this
with my own money I'm not on a BHS PR
list bottom Renaissance Palace one of my
hands-down favorite eyeshadow palettes
besides this product I do not like a
whole lot of things I've tried from ABH
so far guys this room thermostat for my
apartment right now is a 95 degree Will
Survive I feel like my entire Twitter
feed and YouTube feed has been this
palette lately so I'm sure you guys have
heard all about it but there's been some
very mixed reviews on this palette
people are getting really intense about
this like very gung-ho either for it or
against it feel like this is the most
freaking polarizing eyeshadow palette
I've ever seen like coming after people
in their firstborn child if they have
differing opinions on this I think we
just need to take a moment to remember
this is an eyeshadow palette this is
YouTube this is makeup the world is not
going to end based on the subculture
palette there are tons of videos out
there now with full reviews swatches so
not doing a full-on in-depth review on
this because I feel like there are
already so many out there if you want a
really good breakdown on this palette in
the ingredients and everything someone
who I really highly trust and value her
opinion on products is definitely Nicole
and only 4 video down below but she did
like a 40 minute review on this palette
I know you guys on snapchat Twitter
really wanted to see what I think of it
so here we are they actually have a
couple weeks worth of videos
pre-recorded right now so you guys are
going to be seeing a shadow inch moves
coming up video is also a bunch of first
impressions so if you like this video
while you're watching don't forget to
give it a thumbs up I almost just
knocked over good old subculture if
you're new here you can join the BAE
Rito family and subscribe I upload
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific
time let's do this here's looking a
little wild right now so I'm going to
start out with eyeshadow to him using my
Mac painterly Paint Pot in soft ochre or
recently I've been using the Makeup
Forever aqua excel to crime in m-52
which is like a matte tan color but
since I've been using this for literal
years I figured it's probably the best
primer to try out a new eyeshadow
palette with because I've been using it
for so long I know how it performs with
eyeshadows and every
I don't want to clip out my hair right
now so I'll get a major kink in it so
I'm going to tape off my eyes today have
been liking doing this lately just I can
get a really clean line it kind of just
makes everything way easier
that was a long four-game piece of tape
so I have not put this on my idea this
like first impression I have swatched
them and played around with them a
little bit just with my fingers and
different primers and stuff on my arm so
I start out with the shade dawn which is
this match light tan kind of color right
here that just kicked up quite a bit
firstly I don't mind the kickback in the
eye Nastasia oceans on my brows I always
do this when I do my face makeup after
that shade seems to be blending out
nicely there's a lot of fallout I got a
renaissance palette one of my favorite
palettes of all time that one does have
a lot of Fallout too but there's not
like a powder shower happening with that
one on my skin tone this is a pretty
transition shade especially like the
perfect tone I want to use the shade
edge which is this like mustard yellow
color kind of matches my shirt all over
my lid that one doesn't seem to have
quite as much fallout as Dawn I usually
like to use my finger to put on lip
shades so I'm just going to place it
with this this is good
pigment to it damn I'm going to place it
with this and then maybe add some more
with my finger print YouTube super
pigmented it's almost turning like a
green color on the outer part I guess
really to get this much color payoff
with a brush is for me like insane
usually have to use my finger to get
that much so this is super pigmented
it's doing something weird when it gets
into my crease it looks a little bit
like a different color like it looks
like I just blended a different color in
there I've been really liking this brush
from the BH Cosmetics set that I tried
actually I think you guys will be seeing
this video first I have a shadow
missionaries coming out if it's not
already out and it turned out this brush
set from BH Cosmetics and this little
tiny blending brush is great good for
getting like precise right into the
crease so I'm going to take a new wave
which is like the darker orange shade
and blend that into the crease
this brush is mostly good for just like
placing the product I still need to go
in and blend afterwards with the full-on
blending brush new wave and edge seem to
be totally fine Don just has a crazy
amount of fallout so far I'm going to go
back in to blend the edges out okay I'm
going to go back in with new waves since
that got a little bit lost
I want to deepen this up with fudge
which is this Brown this is a repeat
shape they have this in a different
palette by Anastasia apparently they're
kind of two different colors and blend
out differently but I'm going to go to
go who don't want to do fudge or rowdy
ready looks kind of cool rod is like a
deep purple thanks for acting when your
fudge there's like a ton coming off here
and blend that out this one doesn't seem
to be sticking to where I want it like
it's not really staying right there
this shade I don't like this one is a
bit patchy and try kind of packing it on
with this brush instead and see if that
helps yeah not a fan of that shade still
looks pretty patchy the other choice I
think we're blending fine this brown
shade I can't get to totally blend how I
want it just kind of keeps getting
patchy okay I'm going to go back in this
edge which is the first mustard shade
just make it pop again
which is really pretty I like this shade
so I think when I do the lower lash line
after foundation I want to turn out the
shade all-star which is this like
burgundy kind of shade but for now I
think that's everything I want to do on
my lid just actually want to try out
this glitter liner the way this is blue
so this is black oh it's a straight-up
blue save it for another day for liner
I'm going to try out this butter LONDON
glaze in lustrous liner is in the shade
flare looks like it's a brown liner I
don't know if this is metallic or not
I'm going to keep the tape on for this
because it just gives you a line you
don't really have to think about it so
it is like a metallic brown shade the
great thing about tape is that you
pretty much like don't have to think
that did the job doesn't look super
metallic it's just kind of like a shame
I actually might add a little bit ooh
let's do this this is a Catrice liquid
metal cream shadow it's kind of is like
a more cool toned Brown what is this one
I actually add a tiny bit of this just
over top of that this might actually be
purple that looks purple
try to do one this one is in the shade
brown under so guessing this is ground
huh see how it goes a little bit light
kind of like that it was that was kind
of cool kind of like makes your eyes pop
a little bit and I do my eye makeup
first I like doing my brows after my
foundation so I'm going to go in with
foundation next let's peel this off
camera just stopped recording and I
almost missed the most satisfying part
of the entire video where is it ahead
give me an edge here we go
look at that line all right so to prime
I'm going to use the Catrice Prime
inside anti shy and blur stick I
remember using this a while ago I think
it looks like I used it and I think it
actually kind of like filled in my pores
and remember dude I think right now well
guess I'm puttin this on my t-zone feel
like that actually kind of just like
blurred out my pores a tiny bit your
foundation I think I'm going to mix the
clinic beyond perfecting with josie
maran argan actually edition i think
this for me right now this one does
oxidize the Clinique this is in the
shade 0.5 breeze so it will probably be
too dark in a few minutes but let me see
that looks perfect right now but it will
oxidize I'm just going to add in a tiny
little dot of Josie Maran look at that
coverage are you starting to oxidize I
got my eyebrows waxed and I started
breaking out like all along here
especially on this side another thing is
that just a weird coincidence I have
full reviews on both of these
foundations you ever want to know if I
have reviewed a foundation or any
product all you have to do is search it
the Tayla plus the name of the product
of course that is it right where the
edge of this was blended look inlay
right now but like I said it will
oxidize and I'm going to be using a
powder that also oxidizes super
concealer super curious to try this out
this is new Lancome
contente adultress in the shade 110
ivory I think this is new what that
looks dark I hope that's just the
outside it should be the lightest shade
whoa all right let's try it I might have
to mix this in with another concealer is
this a too dark once it's all nice no
this can't be 110 ivory is 0-1 beige if
this is the lightest shade this is an
actual jokes now you're showing up as
much on the viewfinder but this is like
orange
okay well definitely gonna have to mix
this in with something feels nice and
creamy and mix this in with NARS
Chantilly I mean that combo looks good
this feels really nice and creamy I just
wish I could use it in the right shade
so Maybelline fit me 0-5 but I use it
the other day to set my under eyes and
it set it really nice a so they're going
to try this
we need this to set the center of my
face as well
all right so set the rest of my face is
kind of a spoiler alert because you guys
will be seeing this review coming soon
but this is the Clinique beyond
perfecting powder foundation and
concealer this is a powder foundation
because the first time I'm using this as
a setting powder kind of to set my
liquid foundation rather than just on
its own so we'll see how this goes
actually switch brushes to my normal
there we go
mmm I love in this as a setting powder
just made my forehead look super heavy
and caked up right there as a setting
powder this isn't though alright so I
just did my brows for bronzer actually
want to try out using new mask next to
nothing this is a face powder but it's
in the shade dark deep and it looks like
might work hopefully it won't be too
warm as a bronzer but its own looks
pretty nice too will see I have been in
love with this flower beauty brush it's
so soft has like the perfect amount of
flimsiness to it that's pretty warm that
looks like Mac give me Sun almost - she
looks nice now that it's blended out it
looks a little bit less oranjee and kind
of just more like a red tone which I
like dude my forehead with that powder
not looking great
okay I'm actually really liking that as
a bronzer for blush I'm gonna use the it
cosmetics confidence in your glow blush
this is in the shade instant nudes glow
this is kind of like an ombre thing I
think I might have used this once a
while ago but I can't remember what I
thought of it it doesn't look like I've
used this shade at all I'm gonna go in
with that middle shade for blush almost
blending out like a little bit patchy
and chalky for haider I'm going to use a
Smashbox spotlight palette in the shade
pearl this was by Katie Holmes her
collaboration with them I'm use this
shade right here
I want kind of like a champagne
highlight right now oh whoa that middle
shade is super pretty looks a lot darker
in the pan and when it's actually on my
face okay now it's a face it done let's
finish up the eyes going back into the
subculture palette like I said I want to
try the shade all-star
I think first I'm going to use a little
liner brush to just kind of line the
lower lash line
this one at least with this brush I'm
not getting a lot of fallout okay now
I'm going to go in and blend that out
with just a empty brush probably a
little bit of brown shadow left over on
here
I like that shade for the lower lash
line what do I want to do for the inner
corner I think I'm going to use the same
highlight shade yeah light color now wet
my brush a little bit just get more of a
pop on that one there we go I'm going to
go in with a little bit of rowdy on the
same liner brush and just add that to
like the outer third down here all right
I'm going to pop in some lashes and I'll
be right back alright so my lashes are
on a pure bombshell you just always make
any eye look 50,000 times better
my eyes are really red and burning right
now and they were before I put them
lashes I'm not sure if it's something in
the palette or maybe the liquid liner
that I use but my eyes are definitely
looking pretty red I'm gonna go with the
Urban Decay glide on gel pencil and Elka
lines might match the lower lash line
really well oh that's like whoa that's
red and I think that's going to make me
like a finger let's try the Makeup
Forever aqua XL pencil in the shade m80
this just looks like purples hopefully
there we go these pencils aren't the
best for the waterline tried a couple of
their shades of these and they just
don't really go on you have to do like
five thousand layers I'm gonna do my
lower lashes wet-and-wild niggling I did
a little bit on this side already and
then realized I wanted to do waterline
eyeliner alright so last step for lips
I'm going to use a Smashbox always on
liquid lipstick in this shade out loud I
want like a brick orangie kind of color
so hopefully this is that hell yeah the
applicator on this thing is awesome like
what's that line it makes it super easy
to get a clean line my eyes are on fire
right now more than usual I feel like I
need to take off all this eye makeup
right now it's got a filmy intro all
right so I just want to kind of sum up
my thoughts on this thing so far I liked
edge when I look really up-close like I
said when I first landed it out there is
a weird green kind of outline to it like
it all
change colors a little bit in the crease
which is a little bit odd you can still
see it if you look really up close right
here it's done a new way of the tan
color and then this orange one blend it
out totally fine I didn't have any major
issues with those shades besides new way
of kind of getting blended away when I
went to blend out the other shadows I
did not like fudge fudge I felt like was
very difficult to work with
keep in mind you guys are saying the
application cut down into like three or
four minutes probably when in my time
it's now 10:30 s I've been filming for
an hour and a half I listed the clock
and I spent about 45 minutes just on the
eyes so I just feel like I had to work
with these shadows a little bit more
than normal to blend them out and to get
them to look good I'll start in Rowdy on
the lower lash line and I had no issues
with keep in mind wasn't blending those
really with other colors as time just
packing it on the lower lash line though
for this look I didn't end up actually
using any of the shimmer shades which
wasn't intentional but I did want to
point out that when I was watching these
and playing around with them the shimmer
shades were what I was not into at all
so I'm going to just show you guys this
it seems like there's kind of a top
layer on the electric which is this like
kind of light lime-green color when you
swatch it it's just kind of not
impressive at all cube I am like shocked
that this even got put in this palette
honestly cube which is this white kind
of duochrome shade right here it looks
white in the pan it's not white at all
when you actually use it it's like a
pink purpley I actually put it on it is
like pretty much non-existent you guys
have seen that video go around but rusty
is the shade that a lot of people got
tons of kick up from and that someone
actually hit pan on and as you can see
it is very very powdery kind of my
summarizing thoughts on this thing after
obviously only using it today on my eyes
but playing around the other shape a
little bit don't like the shimmer shades
I can flat-out say that not into the
shimmer is the matte shades I tried
today I would say the formula is
definitely more powdery than typical
there's definitely more kick up it's
definitely more powdery than the modern
renaissance palette on the shades that I
tried I think is workable do you want an
eyeshadow palette to be workable
probably not if you're spending $42 on
it you probably want it to be good and
easy to work with for the average
consumer I do feel like it should
probably be a little bit easier to work
with there's something a little bit off
with it there are differences in the
ingredients in these two palettes I'm
not going to go full and in-depth
because it's going to turn into a whole
review for me personally with the shades
that I've played around with I feel like
I could make this work
thoroughly like it no I'm not in love
with it I don't really think I would
spend $42 on this again Oh a BH is
accepting returns on the cell they know
that a lot of people aren't pleased with
it so if you've received it and you're
not pleased with it you can return it so
I don't know do I think we need to start
war over this palette no is it my new
favorite palette definitely not is it
workable yes what I recommend you buying
it probably not there we go my thoughts
in one sentence
if you tried out the subculture palette
let me know what you think of it down
below I asked you guys on Twitter and
there's kind of just really different
responses a lot of people that they like
it and they can make it work and some
people said they absolutely hate it hope
you guys enjoyed having this video as a
bonus video this week lots of exciting
