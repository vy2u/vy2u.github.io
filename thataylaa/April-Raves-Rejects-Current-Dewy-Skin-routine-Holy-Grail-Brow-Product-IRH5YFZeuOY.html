and rejects have just nice it was a good
month for finding new makeup I just
bought a lot of makeup and I tried out a
lot of stuff so I'm excited to share
with you guys there's definitely eyelash
glue stuck where it should not be stuck
all right let's just do it if you saw my
love with food shadow in schmooze I used
the hard candy glamoflauge on Dacian but
man down but I apparently was using the
shade fair into that of porcelain you
can see the difference here this looks
like five shades lighter to me this is
one I was using and then this is the
actual lightest shade in the shade
porcelain holy crap if you have fair
skin you need to get this right now you
can order it online off of Walmart I put
the link down below shade wise it is
actually too light for my skin and I
don't think I've ever had a foundation
ever in my entire life that I can say
that it's actually like too pale for my
skin it's exciting when I actually find
a foundation that's too light because
then I can mix it in with other
foundations I really love that are too
dark so this has a pretty freakin good
coverage and it has a pump piglia the
only thing negative I have to say about
this is that the lasting power is not
great if you want your face to last all
day try mixing this in with like a
longer-lasting foundation like Revlon
Colorstay or something but for days
where you're just like going out to
dinner or whatever don't need your
foundation to last all day this mixed
with this next product is amazing
this is it cosmetics your skin but
better see see illumination I have been
all about the dewy skin lately it just
like makes my heart happy I literally
get excited when I put my foundation on
in the morning these two mix together
our full coverage gives you a super nice
dewy look and this is just beautiful the
other BB cream that I mix in with this
is the leo le BB cream you can get this
off of ebay or amazon I believe I've had
this for a couple years and I stopped
using it because I thought it was
breaking me out I started using it again
and my skin has been totally fine so
I've been mixing it in with this and
also in with Revlon Colorstay and I just
love this BB cream this is a pretty full
coverage BB cream if this was light
enough for my skin I would just wear
this by itself it's really pretty so
those are my favorite from
patience I've been wearing this month
not even this month I'm filming this
video in like the middle of May right
now my next wave is the urban decay
naked skin weightless complete coverage
concealer this is in the shade fair this
is the bomb calm I raved about my NARS
Chantilly concealer I think a couple
months ago I still love that it is
amazing but I think I actually like this
concealer more it gives the same
coverage it just feels so moisturizing
under the eyes it blends out easily and
it doesn't crease and just feels so much
more lightweight to me than the NARS one
I'm obsessed with it the shade is
perfect if you have pale skin it's light
enough
I've never gotten complimented on my
under eyes until I started wearing this
concealer which is a really strange
thing to get complimented on I think I
love this you need this in your life it
is worth the $28 or whatever it is I
don't think you can hear that but when
you close it it is like the most
satisfying click gotta love it next I
have a product that I kind of
rediscovered from like years ago and
that is the Mac mineralized skinfinish
highlighters so this is in the shade
soft and gentle and then the lighter one
over here is lightscapade both of them
actually work on my skin they just look
differently on I prefer lightscapade
because obviously it is like perfect if
you have pale skin soft and gentle can
also work it just gives you more of like
a rosy Goldy glow I don't know how to
even explain the way that these look on
your face it should give you a super
natural glow I have it on my face right
now like just on my cheekbones and down
the bridge of my nose it doesn't look
like too much for work it's not like an
insane highlight I've been completely
obsessed with them I actually got this
one lice capade off of Lamba and it was
like half-price the next thing which I
actually also got from glambot is the
Bobbi Brown compact in Rose this is just
a shimmer brick blush again this just
gives a super pretty pinky glow to your
cheeks it's really hard to overdo this I
apply it with my Olympic rub it sit on
the lace 8:13 brush and these together
are perfect it looks really nice and
natural and just gives your cheeks like
a glow how many times have I said glow
in this video well there's no blush in
my hair
yeah expensive but again beautiful next
I have a brow gel I've been on this
weird a brow gel thing lately I never
used brow gels until a couple months ago
when I started using the ICO brow gel
and that was just like one that I had
laying around and I just decided to try
I recently picked up the benefit give me
brow about a week later I found this guy
this is a Ulta brow tint in the shade
deep this is about a third of the price
as the benefit that's it professional
before I personally think this is even
better it basically gives you the exact
same effect as benefit gimme brow except
it dries faster the color is a lot
better for me it's just more little tone
rather than like reddish it has the same
exact tiny brush so you can really get
in your eyebrows perfectly and like
shape them wearing it right now it just
gives my brows like the perfect kind of
natural fill-in if you're trying out
brow gels for the first time go for this
one it's like six or seven bucks I think
if you've seen any of my videos this
month you probably saw this one coming
but this is the a cosmetics my sculpted
face palette there's six shades in here
and it's basically just a contour
highlight palette this shade right here
is my all-time favorite contour shade no
words for how amazing this blends out
and just looks so natural but gives your
cheeks definition I'm wearing a tiny bit
today I was at work earlier today so
just like up to the make up game to fill
in this video these two shades are the
ones I use on my skin tone if you have
darker skin you could totally use these
this highlight right here looks really
boring in the pan but is like if you
want a real highlight going I also use
it on my inner corner I actually have it
on the bottom lash line right now on the
inner corner the white shade is
worthless like they should just take
this white shade out but everything else
is beautiful if you have been like
searching for the perfect contour shade
and you have pale skin get this because
this contour shade will change your life
I'm fairly confident about that next
rave is the benefit roller lash mascara
this is just a sample one I've been
having an internal debate about whether
or not I can justify spending 25 dollars
on a full-size mascara version of this I
actually got this as a free sample at
Ulta and I
not expecting to like it at all I've
never had a high end mascara that
actually impressed me more than my
drugstore ones this is great it has a
curved brush and it just has these
really tiny bristles that just grab your
lashes really well so you can curl them
it holds a curl I don't really have
issues with my lashes staying curled but
what I really like is like a deep black
mascara that you can just create really
like dull like separated curled lashes
and this totally does that for me
I'm sadly like completely out of it I
don't know I'm having a really hard time
spending $25 on mascara but I think I
might have to my next favorite is a nail
polish line not particularly this color
these are brand new this is the butter
LONDON patent shine ten times nail
polish this is a new line the top just
comes off and then you unscrew it here
like most butter LONDON polishes the
thing I love about these polishes is
that it literally lasts they claim that
it lasts for ten days and this is in the
shade over the moon by the way it's just
like a great color they claim that the
lasts for ten days in it seriously lasts
for a long-ass time I know Mallory
Mallory 1712 she posted on Instagram a
10-day test of this and her nails looked
pretty freakin good after ten days I
feel like I had it on for about eight or
nine days and it did not ship at all I
was just tired of the color so I wanted
to change the polish right now I have
actually shellac on my nails and this is
gonna be my new addiction I've never
gone shellac before I've had them on for
a week now
zero tripping nothing and I just love
them if you're looking for a super
long-lasting nail polish check out this
new line from butter London I have a few
more things this is a long video I feel
like eyelashes I just wanted to give a
quick shout out are my I'm emo glam 12 I
don't know if I mentioned these in raves
and rejects video before but I've been
using them and a lot of shot-down
shmooze videos because these have been
my favorite they're like seven dollars
super affordable but they look like mink
lashes they're super nice and thick and
fluffy and
I love them I favorite perfume this
month has been Marc Jacobs Daisy this is
just a tiny sample version I've
seriously been like hoarding this using
it super sparingly because I don't want
it to run out you need one spritz of
this and it lasts freaking all day long
it smells amazing I've gotten
complimented wearing this one it just
smells really clean and like
sophisticated my last story for the
month which I don't have the actual
thing to show you because it's in my
shower is the african black soap after I
posted my acne routine video which I'll
link down below a lot of you guys
commented saying to pick up the african
black soap i got mine at walgreens it
was like five dollars for two bars of
soap though these huge black bars of
soap that are supposed to be really
great for acne i've been using it for
since that video came out i think i went
got it like the day after that video
came out because so many people said to
go get it so i've been using it for a
few months now and i cannot go without
it when i was traveling and i didn't
have it
my skin did not feel as clean swear my
acne got worse for a few days i don't
know if that was just like timing or
traveling and everything use it i was
like the last step when I'm washing my
face because it just leaves your skin
feeling so clean I feel like that's one
of those products that will just always
be in my face routine from now on the
only reject I had this month is the hard
candy fast and fabulous setting spray
I've heard really mixed reviews about
this and personally just didn't do it
for me I love my L'Oreal infallible
setting spray part of the thing I think
that like turns me off from this is that
the spray is like you're literally
getting sprayed with like a fire hose
it's like very scented it could be a
body spray or something it smells like
cucumber melon it's just not really
something that I feel like I want to
spray on my face I didn't notice a huge
difference in my lasting power of my
foundation when I wore this I think you
can pass on this it wasn't absolutely
horrible I just don't think it's worth
the money spend the extra five or ten
dollars whatever it is and get the
L'Oreal infallible setting spray because
that is amazeballs alright so that was
my April raves and rejects I don't know
how long that just was but I feel like I
just talked for forever I did want to
mention that it picked up the cover
effects
I am cover drops so let me know down
below if you guys want to see a review
on this I have a ton of reviews and
foundations for you guys to do a video

sentence if you guys liked this video
