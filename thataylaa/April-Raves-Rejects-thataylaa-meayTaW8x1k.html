I'm just gonna skip the part where we
talk about how fast April went by
because we all know I feel like I tried
out a ton of new stuff this month
and I have some exciting things to share
with you guys so let's just get into it
I'm gonna start out with two lip
products because I'm too excited about
them okay just had a minor coffee tack
the first favorite is a liquid lipstick
by pretty zombie cosmetics I found them
on Instagram and I'm all about
supporting like small start-up Beauty
companies because I think that's awesome
so I wanted to try out a couple of their
lipsticks this one is in three witches I
am obsessed with it these are liquid
lipsticks that are super pigmented they
dry to a matte finish they have insane
color payoff I posted a picture on
Instagram wearing this literally
obsessed with the formula of it and the
color like who doesn't love a bright ass
purple lipstick they have some crazy
colors I also got the black one these
retail for like 11 dollars which i think
is super reasonable I'm like doing a
squat right now my face your skin a
chair so my next favorite is also a lip
product this is by Milani it's the anti
feathering lip liner it's a lip primer
and a line filler holy crap you guys you
put this on underneath your lipstick or
whatever lip product you're wearing and
the supposed to prime your lips and help
act as like a base just clear it has
this kind of like tacky feeling and I
swear to god it just adheres the
lipstick to your lips I had an
eight-hour shift at Mac the other day
usually I have to retouch my lipstick
every like two hours I literally did not
touch my lipstick for six hours I ate a
burrito came back my lipstick was still
on have it on right now I've been
wearing it under any lipstick that I put
on it is amazing I was debating
mentioning this because I feel like
everyone and their moms know about it
but this is the Real Techniques miracle
makeup sponge I have a whole video
comparison review on this I don't
remember the last time I used a brush
I've been using this every single day to
apply my makeup I don't know what it is
but it's freaking amazing it just gives
you the prettiest flawless finish blends
it out super easily
to worry about getting brushstrokes or
anything like that this is just I feel
like the easiest way to apply foundation
if you saw my last couple get ready with
my videos you probably heard me mention
this but this is the Polish toys shine
stopper it's an instant mattifying
primer basically it is crazy I will put
on my moisturizer and it's tacky feeling
two minutes later I'll put this stuff on
and within like 10 seconds it mattifies
your skin to like a powder finish if you
have combination or oily skin I would
definitely suggest trying out this
primer Paula's Choice is also a really
great skin care line so it's not gonna
clog your pores I have sensitive acne
prone skin and this hasn't affected my
acne at all going along with the
skincare theme I have a couple things I
want to share with you guys first is the
Michael Todd charcoal detox face wash
it's a deep pore gel cleanser I use this
stuff in the shower and it completely
removes any oil or residue or makeup or
anything on my face it smells like oh oh
just get that on my nose it smells like
really fresh kind of minty maybe a
little eucalyptus in there it says that
it's for acne prone and oily skin color
since this is like a charcoal kind of
detox II gel face wash if I want a
little bit of exfoliant in there I've
been mixing in the Fremen facial
polishing mask and this is charcoal and
black sugar I just put a tiny bit of
this stuff in with this and it's kind of
cool this stuff like when you exfoliate
it's sugar black sugar so it like
disappears and kind of melts into your
skin which is really cool I just have
the sample thing this has lasted me like
five times I'm going to be purchasing
the full size of this because I really
like it
my next raise of the month is a perfume
like I needed another perfume I'm a
perfume hoarder and it's kind of an
issue but I couldn't resist this one oh
my god this is the walia walia 21
perfume and it says calm I like kind of
almost Cologne II like musky smells I'm
not gonna sit here and try to describe
sense but to give you a little
background on what I like DKNY apple
Victoria's Secret very sexy
the Dolce Gabanna light blue those are
like my top three so if you also like
those cents you may like this one you
can get this off of Amazon this huge-ass
bottle was like 40 dollars which is
super good for perfume this is also one
of those perfumes where whenever I wear
I always get questions about what it is
that's when you know you've got a winner
my next favorite of the month has been
Essie Borrowed and blue if you're like
I've worn this in like 90% of my videos
this month I'll like try and change it
for a couple days and they'll end up
just going back to borrowed and blue it
is the prettiest powder blue color I
went on a nail polish shopping spree
last week don't ask me why if you want
to see like a spring nail polish video
of the nail polishes that I bought then
let me know down below because it's a
little redecorating the Garnier BB cream
with the Manic Panic dreamtone you're
probably sick of me talking about the
dreamtone but it's perfect for
lightening or foundation have a whole
video on it not going to go too in depth
about it but the BB cream only comes in
I think three or four shades I want to
say three shades which is a little
ridiculous this is obviously the
light/medium shade it has SPF 20 which I
really like it gives you amazing
coverage for a BB cream i use the Real
Techniques sponge to apply this and I
just mix these two together and it gives
you a super pretty kind of like satin
finish I love it
so I've been on this like makeup redo
storage kind of kick lately I don't know
why I've just been really into like
reorganizing all my makeup I feel like I
always use like the same ten products
when I can actually see them then I feel
like I'm gonna use it more you know I
mean they got the Zara Zara box it is
amazing the one I got has three pullout
drawers with these amazing crystal
handles the top you can flip open they
have a bunch of different sizes and
everything that's just and a
acrylic makeup storage container I feel
like acrylic storage cases are usually
like pretty tiny this one is frickin
huge so if you're a makeup Porter
welcome to the club you need this in
your life so I really liked Rasheeda and
hope I'm pronouncing your name right but
the lady who works there is so sweet she
sent me this card with the box and I
just really liked that I really
appreciate when companies are personable
like that and thank you or Ishita so my
only reject for the month which you can
probably guess if you watched my sponge
Smackdown video is the forever 21 Beauty
sponge this is like a freaking rock I've
only been saving it to mention has a
reject I'm literally going to toss it in
the trash let's just do it right now
there you go so that was my April raisin
rejects video if you guys liked it be
sure to give it a thumbs up so I know
the reoccurring polka dots shirt thing
is kind of thing but unlike a polka dot
kick lately I just stepped on my eyelash
glue and literally have eyelash glue
puddles on my carpet right now a plus
for being clumsy okay getting distracted</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
