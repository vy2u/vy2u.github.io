decided to film hope you guys can't hear
that so today I have my audience rings
and rejects for you guys
what the hell August where did you go I
was gone pretty much all of August so
things are seeing are either things that
I rediscovered or magically picked up on
my trips I actually have kind of a lot
of stuff somehow the first thing I would
start out with is probably my favorite
product I've tried in forever I got this
from mate it's actually called my day
the company I did a review on a while
back sent me a few more things to try
out holy crap this eyeprimer set upside
down here this eyeprimer is amazing I am
obsessed with my Mac's painterly
paint-pot
I've never found anything that comes
even close to that for primer for me
because I like a creamy and also have a
little bit of coverage to them so it
hides any like veiny lines or in my case
freckles yeah I have freckles on my eyes
somehow and this stuff oh my god
so creamy I'm gonna swatch it for you
guys so you can see how like you
literally that's all you need and I
don't know if you can see that can you
see that there we go
it is just so creamy and feels so
amazing makes your eye shadow stay on
all day is about half the price as Mac's
painterly paint-pot
I'll have the link down below where you
can find it but when I run out of my
Mac's Paint Pot I don't think I'm gonna
be repurchasing it I'm gonna be using
this and then repurchasing this for the
rest of my life all right we had to
change location a little bit next
product I have been obsessed with is the
mary lou manizer by the balm and look at
the packaging it doesn't get much better
than that this is a powder highlighter
and looks like this I got this off of
hot look out look whatever the hell it's
called for I think it was like 17 bucks
um but basically hot look is a site
where you get like majorly discounted
clothing makeup jewelry everything and
the bomb comes on there time to time and
so this time when it was on there I was
like you know what I'm just gonna
splurge and get it I actually don't have
a powder highlighter that I love until I
found this thing and when I first opened
it I was like alright this doesn't look
that great it doesn't even look shiny on
here but then when you swatch it it is
like shiny amazing yes it's not even
doing it justice wearing it right now
and it's just so frickin pretty look at
that I hope you guys can see that and
what I like about it is two things you
only need a really tiny bit I usually
apply it with a stippling brush and ii
totally lost my train of thought
oh and second since it's a powder
highlighter if you like your face fully
flawless and you set it with like a
powder foundation or whatever then this
is gonna work for you i have a cream
highlighter that i love but i can only
use it when I'm doing like a dewy look
because cream highlighters don't go over
powder well since this is powder you can
use it with anything
the next thing I've been looking for a
good like tingly face scrub because I
don't know I like feeling tingly i
tweeted you guys and did i post on my
facebook i don't know i tweeted you guys
asking what a good like tingly face
scrub was because I really liked the
lush one but I didn't want to pay like
$35 for a face scrub and like multiple
people tweeted back they clean and clear
deep action exfoliating scrub I've heard
the one the morning burst one in the
yellow bottle like the brightening one
is also really good but I just really
liked the smell of this one and just
like looks cleaner to me than the yellow
one I don't know packaging weird it
doesn't smell like you would expect it
smells kind of fruity really fruity but
like kind of minty at the same time
basically this is just an exfoliating
scrub with the little beads in it but it
makes your face feel amazing I look
forward to taking off my makeup at night
so I can use this and not only does it
feel tingly when it's on your face but
like after you wash it off you can
definitely feel the menthol in it
because it your face is still like
how do I describe this like refreshing
feeling sometimes don't wonder how you
guys like follow what I'm saying they
like half the time I make absolutely no
sense my next favorite is two nail
polishes these are like total summer
colors to me this one is Joe Li Jie's 9
to 5 it's not even showing up true to
color on there it's a neon peach
basically and this is definitely one of
my all-time favorite nail polishes
I loved the Julie G line if you don't
know Julie G is a fellow youtuber so
that's cool but this color is just
unlike any other nail polish color I've
ever had and then the other nail polish
is color club's Jackie O and I just got
the mini one because I'm kind of to the
point where I have so many nail polishes
that if they make it in the mini I'm
gonna buy it because when was the last
time you went through a whole bottle of
neon ass nail polish never I don't think
I've ever actually finished a bottle of
nail polish so this is a perfect neon
super neon fuchsia color it's on my toes
right now if you want to see the color
just Google Color Club jackieo next
thing is a brush and it's the Sigma
round top kabuki f82
and it's a super super dense round top
brush basically freaking love Sigma
brush is so soft such good quality I
love my elf brushes but there's certain
things that you can't get from elf
brushes the quality is it so dense I use
this for setting my under eye concealer
link will be down below where you can
find Sigma alright I really do have a
lot of favorites this month's one is the
Neutrogena Healthy Skin liquid makeup
and I'm in the color classic ivory the
lightest shade there is I instagrammed a
picture of this after I bought it and
you guys were like tripping balls about
how amazing it was this is supposed to
be comparable to NARS sheer glow I
haven't tried NARS sheer glow so I don't
know I'm not really down to spend like
50 bucks on a foundation I tried this
out personally I don't like wearing this
alone it's not enough coverage for me
but this over my maybelline superstay
gives you like the prettiest kind of
dewy but not oily at
foundation look and I love it it really
had more stuff than I thought I did I'm
gonna kind of roll through these so you
guys don't get bored the next thing is
these sunglasses holy look at these
babies you know that we've had a little
photo shoot with sunglasses they are
hand beaded on the side cat eye doesn't
get much better than this people I got
these from I think it's called brown
beaded net I posted an Instagram picture
I post Instagram pictures of everything
so just follow me if you want to see all
that good stuff the link will be right
here down below it'll be down below I
just think they're so unique and you can
tell that they're really well made I
haven't had any beads fall off she has
different styles too there's not just
cat eye the last two favorites are both
by wet and wild and I just keep them in
my Z palette which is just a magnetic
palette or you can do pot things so
these are my two favorites I have been
using these pretty much every damn day
this is the wet and wild bronzer and
goddess and it's just a matte super dark
bronzer so I apply it with a like big
fluffy brush he blush which I'm sure
you've heard about it's pretty popular
this is in heather silk and okay I would
never pick out this blush for myself the
color and like the pan just doesn't
appeal to me but when you put it on your
face it gives you the prettiest blush to
your face and those are really cheap
you're those from the drugstore for I
think it's like around $2 somewhere
around there my last thing which has
some stuff in it right now is this purse
that holy it's amazing look at this
purse it has these long straps that are
like golden black has like black leather
and the gold chain and then looks like
this and I like it because it's pretty
like compact petite something like that
and it's just the perfect size for me I
got it from a website called I think
it's called Jap swag calm which is an
interest
website name link will be down below
like everything else and yeah you can
get it there if you like it I think
there was other colors there might have
been like a cream white one and also
it's cool because it came with a
matching studded wallet yeah last
favorite right there then for my rejects
I don't have identified anything that I
like absolutely hated this month
I just have two things that are like
honorable mentions of rejects they're
not like horrible and I'm sure some
people will love them but personally for
me they just didn't work first thing I
was not a fan of is a Neutrogena deep
clean shine control and this is a new
product I'm pretty sure like within the
last month and basically you can use
this as a daily cleanser or an intensive
mask where you leave it on for three
minutes I tried both of those things I
don't know I just I'm not a fan of Newt
Regina's new like rice complex thing
this is supposed to control your shine
for up to eight hours with rice protein
and that's what was in there damn like
oil control makeup their new line but it
feels so gross to me the consistency
reminds me of like toothpaste with like
grit in it I don't know
not a fan it's a really weird feeling I
was expecting the 3-minute mask to kind
of harden like a mask usually does and
it was just kind of like chilling on my
face it says you'll feel the cooling
intensity build as it goes down deep
that's what she said that was
inappropriate yeah there wasn't any
cooling intensity at all that's why I
tried it I was on this like cooling
tingly thing and yeah this didn't do
anything
the next reject which okay I'm sure this
would work great for a lot of people I
don't think it's a bad product it does
what it says just for me I didn't like
it it's the Sedona lace new stick it to
them i primer um I am very picky with my
eye primers like I kind of said before I
like thick creamy eye primers I can feel
on my eyes this is kind of terrible too
Urban Decay's primer potion so if you
like that you'll probably like this it's
just very thin
shir and it feels really light on your
eyes which I'm like I said I'm sure a
lot of people love so if you like Urban
Decay's primer potion I would actually
give this a shot because this is ten
dollars versus 18 or whatever the primer
potion is I don't know I'm just not like
crazy about the consistency but try it
out if you like Urban Decay's primer
potion
like I said 25 times so that was
everything you guys are watching this I
will be in not America if you want to
know where I'm gonna be in what's going
on up to the video links down below
called where I am or something like that
mmm yeah I don't know how to end this
video comment down below with what your
favorite products of August were thumbs
up if you like this and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
