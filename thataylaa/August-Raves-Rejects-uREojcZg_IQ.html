and rejects don't know for calling it
August raves and rejects or middle of
the month raves and rejects kind of
missed the month of August but we're
doing it that's all that matters I've
been pretty much wearing the same exact
makeup every single day for work so what
I'm sharing with you guys really works
for me and I'm very excited about it
so for foundation I've been obsessed
with these two products together I think
they need each other
the first is benefit Porefessional I
have the mini version because I'm too
cheap to buy the full version but this
product with this product is amazeballs
this is the Maybelline Dream wonder
fluid touch foundation this is in the
shade 10 porcelain I agree have a whole
first impressions video on this
foundation I'll link it right here if
you haven't seen that yet I was using
this stuff with my Maybelline a primer
once I converted to this primer I
noticed such a difference in the lasting
power I got way less oily throughout the
day and just stayed on better it looked
better overall so if you've tried this
on nation and you have found that it
hasn't lasted long on your face try it
with benefit Porefessional makes a big
difference onto the foundation
I am so pleasantly surprised by this
foundation it is so lightweight feels
like you're not wearing a foundation at
all when you blend it into your skin it
just literally feels like you're not
playing anything I like to apply it with
my where is it Sigma f80
kabuki brush this is my favorite way to
apply this foundation
I don't like applying it with my hands I
don't like applying it with a sponge it
just soaks everything up it looks super
natural but gives you coverage my
freckles still show through but it
covers all of my acne and redness is
amazing the end I feel like I just
talked a lot about that my next makeup
favorite is the Maybelline falsies
mascara I've talked about this a while
ago
ended up using my L'Oreal voluminous
mascara because I had to that I had
already bought it and I wanted to use
them up I just I can't go back now I
really love this mascara there's a
curved brush on here so it just gives
you really nice curved lashes obviously
I actually don't like getting the
waterproof version this is just the
volume ex-girl this is waterproof I
tried the waterproof version and the
normal kind actually prefer the non
waterproof version in this mascara I do
use it still with my Mac prep and prime
eyelash primer and I just love the way
that it makes my lashes look really does
kind of make you look like you have
falsies a little bit not quite more than
a normal mascara has actually all I have
for makeup favorites of the month since
I've been wearing the same thing pretty
much every day I don't have that much
new makeup stuff to share with you guys
but next month I will because I just
tried a lot of stuff that I'm excited
about alright so for skincare I've
recently been trying out a new acne
medication and so far it's working
really well I think my skin is for sure
clearing up when I ordered it they gave
me this mini Sarah of the survey foaming
facial cleanser and pretty much all out
of this little bottle and I've been
using it everyday at night and in the
morning I've never been attracted to
Sarah B survey don't have to say it just
because I don't know I feel like they're
just so like plain since I put so much
stuff on my face I feel like just having
a plain simple cleanser that works in
takes everything off is kind of
refreshing this says is for normal to
oily skin so basically anyone except dry
skin should use this it just leaves your
skin feeling super clean there's not
much I can say about it it's just a
normal cleanser but I've been really
liking it next two things are hair care
products I've been really into hair care
stuff lately I don't know why I usually
hate dealing with hair
I usually hate everything hair related I
just I don't like hair I don't like
doing hair not into it not my thing but
lately I've been into hair care products
for some reason I just ordered a bunch
of new stuff off of pot look whoa
but this is the stuff that I've been
really liking this month L'Oreal ever
pure sulfate free conditioner I also
really like the shampoo when it's in my
shower and it's wet right now so I
didn't grab it this was just one of my
backup ones in the scent rosemary mint
actually liked the green bottle one
better I can't remember what that's
called
both of these smell amazing if you like
really clean minty kind of sense it
smells really good kind of smells like
when you go to the salon this whole line
is sulfate free which is really great if
you have a color treated hair
I do dye my hair black obviously this
has no sulfates in it protects from
stripping your hair of its color smells
amazing leaves my hair feeling super
soft super healthy and I just really
like both the shampoo and the
conditioner and I feel like it's really
hard to find a good sulfate free shampoo
that actually lathers and this one does
so winter back to skin care I don't know
why I thought this was a hair product
next is the body shop tea tree face mask
debating whether I should mention this
in this month's video or next month's
video because I did get this at like the
end of August then I was like it I
like it we're mentioning it so this is a
face mask it says it's suitable for
blemished skin tea tree oil is supposed
to be really good for acne I was in Ulta
and they were having some kind of sale
on this I can't remember this was around
$15 that's like pretty pricey for me but
I've been kind of splurging on skincare
stuff lately I just want to get rid of
my acne and I want to have nice skin and
I want to not have to wear foundation it
smells so good it smells straight-up
like tea tree if you don't like that
scent then you wouldn't like this but
it's pretty strong has kind of like a
minty
feeling on your face it kind of tingles
Sting's I like that because I feel like
it's working I've been using this pretty
much every like three days which might
be a little much for a face mask but I
just really like the way that it feels
on my face so I can't resist next is a
nail polish which has stuff all over it
actually it came like this in the mail I
instagrammed a picture wearing this nail
polish and a bunch of people commented
want to know what it was and where they
can get it this is the absolute nail
color with an exclamation point at the
end if you're really excited about it I
think this was a dollar super reasonable
I got it off of I eat house I'll link it
below this is in the shade pink very
original
China Glaze flip-flop fantasy you don't
know how many times I just try to say
that is usually my go-to neon pink nail
polish but this is my new favorite this
is the most neon of all neons for a
dollar you can't go wrong
lastly I have kind of a random product
that's like in my hair right now this is
a steamer when I was subletting an
apartment over the summer the girl there
left her huge a steamer it was like a
super nice hundred dollar like cone air
steamer and it changed my life
I've never steamed clothes before I
would dread ironing clothes I just like
wouldn't wear the clothes if they were
wrinkly the steamer changed my life I
now wear clothes not wrinkly ones so
when I moved into my own apartment
couldn't move drop the first steamer
anymore I decided to buy a mini steamer
I got this off of Amazon I think this
was like I want to say $25 $20 somewhere
around there super reasonable first Emer
is handheld so it's easier it just plugs
into the wall you fill it up with water
and then you literally just press the on
switch and you just steam your clothes
magically takes out all of the wrinkles
is amazing I feel so old
you know steaming flow
and things that was not the last thing I
don't know why I said that so now lastly
I have a few jewelry things that I'm
super excited about and I've been
wearing pretty much all month
first is this set of three necklaces
this is from the Etsy seller layered and
long I mentioned this in my what was
that Mimi box unboxing video I was
wearing it I will link it over here if
you want to see what it looks like on
you can custom pick three different
layers she has tons of different options
on her website and you can choose like
the bead color and everything mine are
just black beads are either wear all
three together or just a circle one or
just a long one I like it because
they're separate so you can you can do
that the owner of the shop is so sweet
and I would definitely recommend you go
check out her shop I do have a coupon
code if you guys end up getting anything
I'll leave the code right here it's 10%
off your whole order the next piece of
jewelry is this bracelet this is from
the Etsy sellers SHINee anody they were
so sweet they sent me this their store
is located in Tel Aviv
Elden Tel Aviv over the summer last year
so special place in my heart I just
think this is so unique and so pretty I
can't clip it by myself with one hand
which is why I'm not wearing it right
now but this is what it looks like on
I usually pair this with my silver watch
and I just really like how it looks
together so that was everything the Sun
is starting to peak out in weird places
so I'm going to go if you want to see
this look I do have shadow inch moons
coming up next love you guys thanks for
watching see you in my next video fight
