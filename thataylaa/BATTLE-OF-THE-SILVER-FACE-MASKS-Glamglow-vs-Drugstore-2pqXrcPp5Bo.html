leopard robe on got some tea which means
it's time to face mask it up
so if you follow me on snapchat I wear a
face mask almost every single night it's
just what I like to do kind of like my
wine down routine I just love good face
masks or something about it so I want to
do a side-by-side comparison of two
silver masks one is drugstore one is
high-end this is a glam glow gravity mud
firming treatment mask and then this is
the in light super face liquid assets
detoxifying platinum peel-off mask
suppose these are silver peel-off mask
schools good like nice and cold so I
want to put these on and then we're
going to talk about the claims in
comparison and price and all that good
stuff so this in light mask I'm going to
do on this side of my face glam glow
we're doing on this side the cool thing
about this packaging is it literally
just has a twist open which is cool
until you try and squeeze it out I have
worn both of these masks one time each
so I have kind of first sauce on them
but when you go to squeeze out this mask
I mean you really got to squeeze this
out so it looks really cool but you
really have to squeeze this bottle look
at that that is so cool so I'm just
going to start by spreading why did I
put this on my bad hand no idea because
these are peel-off mask you do want to
get kind of a thick layer yeah why am i
using my left hand right now this one
kind of just has a chemical scent a
little bit and it just got that on my
approach with peel-off mask I always
like to have a lot on one of the edges
just so when it dries I can easily peel
it off I never apply face mask to my
upper lip I don't know why I just feel
like I can't talk or move or live my
life so there we have the in light side
let's get going with this glam glow side
over here this one is actually white in
the door it turns into like a chrome
color the scent on this one holy-shit
sees if you've ever smelled the piña
colada maybe it's just pineapple that
jellybean it's like pineapple jelly bean
mixed with the popcorn jellybeans are
you team popcorn jelly bean or do you
hate it let me know down below yeah it's
like very artificial syrupy smelling to
me super strong scent too and this one
comes with a brush to apply it it is
super stringy and the first time I did
this I got it all over my shirt if you
have any baby hairs
those things behind your ear or else
you're going to get a little waxing the
silver color is obviously much lighter
going on the glam glow one feels a bit
cooling decide I don't have much of a
cooling effect but this one I do feel a
nice kind of cold so I think I have
brows the same amount on this side is
already starting to dry in some parts I
can feel it and this side is too yeah
still a bit sticky it's not totally dry
yet I normally just leave facemask on
for anywhere from a half hour to a
couple hours so glam glow says leave on
for 20 to 30 minutes in light it also
says leave on for 20 to 30 minutes so
we're going to do 30 minutes this 915
right now so I'm going to leave the face
masks on both sides until 9:45 let's see
some of the claims about each product
talk about price and everything like
that so starting with glam glow I'm on
sephora's website you can get this for
$69 and it has 1.4 ounces of product in
it the in light mask online you can
actually buy in two different sizes I
only saw this size in my store this is
the 3.4 ounce size so this is a ton of
product but you can buy one out sized
online for $7.99 three point for
outsized retails for twenty bucks when I
got this is buy one get one free at CBS
CBS pretty much always rotates out their
sales so just wait til its brand goes on
sale you can probably get it buy one get
one half off or buy one get one free but
breaking this down into price per ounce
this product is five dollars and ninety
one cents per ounce and glam glow get
ready for this is forty nine dollars and
28 cents per ounce so we have quite a
price difference between these two
products what is in this there better be
magic in here so reading some of the
claims on Sephora's website it says the
same mud base peel-off mask designed to
tighten the appearance of skin so this
is for helping with fine lines and
wrinkles uneven skin tone loss of
firmness in the elasticity peels off the
skin to visibly tighten and lift for a
youthful looking complexion on the
actual ingredients list polyvinyl
alcohol and alcohol are the second and
third ingredients so according to polish
choice for the most part polyvinyl
alcohol is totally fine it's just an
ingredient that's found in peel-off mask
denatured alcohol on the other hand can
aggravate and weaken the skin and this
is if it's elusive as
fifteen reading or higher it's
considered a risk and the glam glow mask
does have it listed third there's also
some interesting gradients in here
there's licorice and marshmallow leaf
which is supposed to help with the
firming apparently hyaluronic acid which
is good for anti-aging and glacial clay
those main claims on this one let's read
about this one on the back of here and
on the website it says the same thing so
it says this unique mineral rich
peel-off mask contain proprietary
antioxidant blends of colloidal platinum
and malachite extract along with a
cocktail of anti-aging peptides this
mask helps to reduce the appearance of
fine lines and wrinkles and improved
skin luminosity while shifts away dead
skin cells and impurities to reveal
immediate invisible results what results
looking on the ingredients list for this
one I also see polyvinyl alcohol as the
second ingredient there is rosemary in
here grapefruit aloe leaf extract so I
do like that this comes in two sizes if
you want to try it out you can get the
one ounce one for $7.99 which is
obviously super affordable so it's 9:22
we're going to check back in at 9:45
after 1/2 hour and see if I'm looking
firmer and brighter so I'll check back
in with you guys in a few minutes ok so
it's now 949 so a few minutes over 30
minutes fun for a little over 30 minutes
got really into a blog I was watching
now put the fun part I'm excited let's
peel this thing off I'm going to start
over here the thing I really like about
the Enlightenment is it peels off super
easy and peels off in one piece which I
like because I hate when you have a
peel-off mask and it leaves behind the
little things you have to sit there
peeling off or forever alright so this
is totally off well this is interesting
so now on to the glam glow side OOP on
the con on some hairs this one feels a
little bit what's the word I can feel it
coming off your skin more I feel like
and this one does leave behind a little
bit more so looking at my face this side
to me looks definitely more luminous and
a little bit brighter actually but this
side I feel like I could just go I
always wash my face after wearing face
masks but if you're someone who's just
lazy and you want to peel it off and go
to bed
not recommending that but this side
feels like there is pretty much no
residue on it this side I don't know if
I would do that it does feel like
there's a little bit something on my
skin leftover tightness actually my
forehead feels like all right it feels a
little bit tight
I really can't notice a difference
besides the luminosity is I definitely
looks more luminous my pores actually
also looks a little bit smaller on the
glam glow side but firmness and
tightness I feel pretty much the same so
like with most face masks you have to
use them a few times to actually see a
difference at least on my skin I do so
I'm going to continue to use these if
you want a silver mask and you just like
the look of it which I know is really
appealing about these masks I would say
go with the enlight one I do like the
cooling sensation that this one gives
and it is a little bit more brightening
and luminous as far as long-term firming
and anti-aging and all that stuff it's
hard to tell off of a couple uses of any
products it sent for me on this one is a
huge turnoff if you're sensitive to
sense this is extreme I think this is an
extreme even if you're not sensitive to
sense this one is way more affordable
you're getting way more for your money
what I pay $69 for this probably not to
be totally honest two thing that
attracts me most about this mask is the
silver color and if I can get that from
this mask from the drugstore
hell yeah so if you guys liked this
video make sure you give it a thumbs up
so I know I've done kind of first
impression videos on a few different
masks so I'll link those videos down
below in the description box and in the
little I over here if you want to go
watch it
