talking all about white concealers I'm
doing kind of a side-by-side comparison
to see if this new la girl pro conceal
in the white shade is to do for the Kat
Von D lock-it concealer in white the
price difference is pretty large on
these two products so if this is do
pible you can save you some money when I
first started my channel there was no
such thing as white concealers white
foundation mixers it didn't exist now
there are so many amazing products out
on the market that can help if you have
light skin or if you just want to adjust
the shade of your foundation if you are
new to my channel right now I have a ton
of videos for people with pale skin
mixing white concealers and white
products in with your foundation is a
great way to lighten it so I used one
concealer on half of my face in the
other concealer on the other half not
just for under my eyes but also as a
foundation mixer so I do have both of
these products all over my face right
now I'm going to show you guys how they
apply and how they wear throughout the
day and see if the Kat Von D one is
worth the money
so three some of the claims on both of
these the Kat Von D one has point to two
ounces of product in two retails for $26
and the la girl concealer has 0.28
ounces and retails for between $2.99 and
399 I got this for $2.99 on I Kate house
I'll link it down below but they have
awesome deals on cheap makeup and just
makeup brands that aren't super popular
they've had this normal concealer out
for years now but they just came out
with the white shade and they also came
out with three other color correcting
shades I believe but as soon as I saw
they came out with a white one I
literally went on my phone and bought it
that second so obviously quite a big
price difference and you also get more
product in this so let's quickly read
some of the claims on Kat Von D first it
says it's a rich and creamy concealer
with 24 hour wear and instant full
coverage brightens the under eye covers
blemishes corrects discoloration
contours and bakes obviously depending
on what shades are using for what has a
hydro boost complex that's supposed to
prevent creasing and it's supposed to be
hydrating so that's pretty much
everything on the Kat Von D let's read
about the LA girl allegro says it's a
crease resistant opaque coverage creamy
yet lightweight texture long wearing
formula camouflages darkness under
the eyes redness skin imperfections
provides complete natural looking
coverage even skin tones covers dark
circles and minimizes fine lines around
the eyes so nothing too crazy you pretty
much both sound like a standard
concealer basically typically in the
past Kat Von D products feel very heavy
on my skin I am going to be doing a
whole review on the Lockett tattoo
foundation coming soon because tons of
you guys always ask about that
foundation will probably do that for a
foundation Friday we'll use this
concealer at one time and I haven't used
this one at all in the way that I'm
using these today it is the first
impression I've never mixed this one
with foundation haven't touched this one
at all so here we go if you like this
video at any point while you're watching
make sure you give it a thumbs up I'm
gonna leave my pale skin playlist down
below if you want to learn more about
the products that I use for pale skin
what works for me what doesn't let's
jump into the video alright so I just
filmed how I did my makeup in high
school video hence why I have eyeliner
still stuck on my eyeballs that I can
get off that video will be up before
this video so if you missed that I will
link it down below so I've already
primed my face using the it cosmetics
bye bye pores primer you guys know if
you're pale princess or if you just have
foundation that's a little bit too dark
for you that you want to still be able
to use I'm all about foundation mixers
Manic Panic dream tones one my favorite
but if you have a white concealer you
can also mix that in with your
foundation so it'll just give it a
little bit more coverage since
concealers do have more of a concealer
formula they're a little bit thicker
typically and I have coverage so it
probably typically choose a concealer
over foundation mixer only if I have a
super liquidy foundation formula so
today I'm using the Garnier BB cream
this is the combo to oily skin one the
normal one is horrible but the combo to
oily skin one is actually pretty good
this is in the shade light to medium but
it is way dark back in the day when I
first started my youtube channel I used
to use this when I would like self tan
because it is super dark but I feel like
it'll be a good formula to try out with
these concealers so let's do Kat Von D
on this side of my face and a lay girl
on this in my face shaking this stuff
really good you can hear how liquidy it
is I'm just putting out a little bit
since this is only for half half my face
so I'm just going to start with about
this
amount of concealer to foundation you
can see the foundation already running
so it's definitely lightening it these
two formulas seem to be mixing well
together so now I'm just going to take
that and apply on the face shade wise I
think that's pretty good even if you're
not pale but you have a hard time
finding foundations that match you
perfectly
you can mix in any kind of concealer
light girl does make a yellow concealer
I believe so if you have more yellow
toned skin and it's hard to find
foundations that have a yellow undertone
to them try mixing in a little bit of
yellow concealer this BB cream is super
dewy so this concealer is definitely
modifying it and I feel like it doesn't
look quite as skin like so here's one
side now I'm going to take the same
foundation and mix in a little bit of
the LA girl people love the formula of
this concealer I've never been able to
use this concealer because it is too
dark so I have a feeling that this will
mix well with foundations it comes with
this little brush applicator but I'm
just going to see if I can pop that off
because I'm not that into this and just
has a little squeezy tube I'm going to
start with about that much
it looks like less than the Kat Von D
since that one I had to like push onto
the palette but this is about the same
amount of product off the bat with my
finger I can tell that this is a lot
more not liquidy but it's just not quite
as thick as a Kat Von D same thing on
this side oh yeah definitely more dewy
we're getting a really nice satin finish
on this side I'm someone who prefers
more satin dewy finish I think it just
makes your skin look more like skin but
if you like matte you might like the Kat
Von D one a little bit better this one
is going a lot farther like I've only
used half the amount of product out on
the palette right now and I've covered
my entire half of my face
coverage and finish wise I'm definitely
preferring this side right now so Kat
Von D la girl I am definitely feeling
this side
I don't think this one looks bad I just
feel like we didn't get quite as good of
coverage you can still see some acne and
stuff coming through and this one just
looks a little bit more flawless finish
wise and coverage wise so the concealer
I'm going to be mixing today is the LA
girl Pro conceal in the shade porcelain
I've never actually been able to wear
this because it is way too dark for me
people say this shade is light but this
has never worked on me it's super dark
so we get to lighten it today
heck yeah so on this side I'm going to
stick with Kat Bundy this side la girl
and I think I'm actually going to apply
the white down first then put all of the
concealer and then blend it out with the
brush on my face you could mix it first
on a palette if you want to but I think
this way will work fine Kat Von D and it
her consistency just feels very heavy to
me when I mix it with my brush that I
usually used morphe G 38 like it might
have just put a ton of concealer on
we'll find out yep I'm going to use my
finger just to get some that off it's
drying super super fast it feels like it
just totally dried in about ten seconds
I'm going to do an up close side-by-side
once this eye is on but look at how much
of a difference concealer makes I'm
saying just like lifts your whole face
since I just took off the brush
applicator I guess we would pop it back
on maybe not I think I broke it
I'm going to use my finger to put down
some white yeah the formula of this is
so much creamier I feel like with this
brush applicator you just can't really
control how much product you're putting
out just kind of like glops all over the
place it's setting pretty quickly too
but not as fast as the Kat Von D at all
I think this one looks a tiny bit
lighter so I'm just going to add tiny
bit more white right in the inner
portion feel like I'm always hearing of
this concealer is like super full
coverage the LA girl and on me doesn't
look as full coverage as the Urban Decay
Naked or the Tarte shape tape it's
brightening because of the white but
coverage wise yeah I'm not on either
side actually I don't think I'm getting
as good of coverage as you usually do
for under the eyes I think
I actually like the Kat Von D better I
feel like this kind of setting better
and also just think I got a tiny bit
better coverage on this side I'm going
to show you guys a close-up right now so
obviously this is without a setting
powder right now I think both sides look
totally fine but I do prefer the Kat Von
D on this side is eyeliner is intense my
pores on this side
I just noticed look quite large you see
them on this eye too but not as much
yeah look at that right there
my pores look pretty giant this side you
can see them around here a little bit
but just not as much I'm gonna set the
eyes using my Holy Grail Physicians
Formula this is the translucent light
correcting powder awesome if you peel
skin and the brush I'm using is the
morphe e 7 to set my whole face today
I'm going to use a cosmetics celebration
foundation illumination love this powder
I'm just going to set the sides of my
face I don't want to set the center
because I think it makes it look more
like skin when the center of my face is
kind of dewy
so I'm going to apply the rest of my
makeup and I will be right back alright
so the rest of my makeup is on I totally
forgot that this BB cream oxidizes like
super fast so I probably could have
mixed in a little bit more Lightner I'm
looking pretty tan right now but that's
okay so as far as how the two sides look
right now even though my pores look
bigger on this side it is sitting a lot
nicer around the crease of my nose this
one looks like it's already starting to
kick up a little bit around my nose this
one just looks very smooth around there
this side of my face I definitely think
looks better it looks a little bit
heavier and this clinging to some like
dry patches down here it doesn't look
bad neither side looks bad but right now
I am favoring this side a little bit
more but we'll see how it wears
throughout the day on the rest of my
face I used other stuff that I got from
my Kate house $4 this blush is in the
shade amuse this was a dollar blush I
really like the color of this but it
smells like straight-up grandma slash
perfume whoa it's intense
the contour I really like this contour
shade I used
is a mix of these two and this is from
the city color contour palette on the go
I also use this on my eyes I use that
shade in the crease also got this for my
Kate house this is another giant contour
palette I haven't tried these as a
contour yet but I use this white
shimmery shade as a highlight right now
I think it's okay it emphasizes my
texture a little bit but not bad and
then lips is color pop she bad with
fairy floss gloss over top so it is
12:30 right now 12:30 - I'm going to
keep this on for the rest of the day and
I will check back in with you guys at
the end of the night I'm going to go
watch a football game
hang out do some editing it's Saturday
right now when I'm filming this I'm just
gonna do one check-in at the end of the
night so you guys can see how it wears
throughout the day all right so now at
10:30 p.m. so it's been on for about 11
ish hours overall I'm actually surprised
at how similarly both sides wore I
actually have almost no creasing on my
upper lip which is pretty rare the Kat
Von D side of my nose is definitely more
crazy than this side both of them have
creasing right now but this one has less
creasing I feel like this one is pretty
intense my forehead for sure looks a
little oily I think next time if I were
to wear the same combo I would set my
entire forehead with the powder but both
sides look about the same I do still
like the way that this side of my face
looks compared to this side
this one looks a little bit patchy this
one just looks a little bit more
flawless but for the price whether
you're going to be mixing it in with the
foundation or just wearing it under your
eyes alone or mixing it in with a
concealer I would say go with the LA
girl for 3 bucks you might as well try
this out if you don't like it try the
Kat Von D one but I think this one is
actually nicer formula wise the form of
this is just pretty heavy and a little
bit thicker this one feels a lot more
blendable creamier I just overall like
the formula of this one a little bit
better and for three bucks versus 26 you
can't go wrong so I hope you guys liked
this video if you did make sure you give
it a thumbs up I am going to go wash all
this off and go to bed
I'm freaking tired love you guys thanks
for watching see you next video
