take this thing off I am currently
wrapped in my leopard wrote from here on
down all right I'm super excited for
today's video I'm also really hungry so
I just go in two different videos today
so that's why we look the same I did
fill in the shadow and schmooze on the
look i'm wearing right now which i'm
pretty sure will be up before this yeah
and the NARS foundation review both of
those will probably be up before this
video I'll link them down below if you
want to watch him alright today we're
gonna be unboxing bauble bar so freaking
excited for this just look at the
packaging this packaging just like makes
my heart happy so we're gonna be
unboxing this thing in this video is
going to be a surprise for both of us
because I completely forget what i
ordered a few weeks ago bars basically
an online jewelry site they have free
shipping and returns hell yeah they have
some really cute stuff and a lot of it
is super affordable I do have a coupon
code for you guys the URL is bubble bar
calm / tayla it's just the last half of
my youtube name don't ask me why he also
gave me a coupon code to give you guys
which is teyla for twenty percent off
your entire purchase which is freakin
sweet so we're going to unbox these and
try them on look at these bags this is
so exciting I'm gonna have as many of
the products as I can listed below so
you guys can check them out if you want
to get them yourself each of them come
in this little pouch which i think is
adorable I don't know what you can put
these you guys have any ideas I like
their stickers ooh first one I got is
this layered necklace let us try it on a
little bit tinkle oh god I gotta go
alright so this is what the first
necklace looks like I hope we're in
focus right now I can't tell I've never
had a necklace like this with like five
thousand layers and I think it's really
cool feel like it looks good with this
kind of talk to just like a simple black
tank top and a roll that thing I've been
all about the brawl that's lately
alright so next I have a pair of
earrings I've been seeing these kind of
earrings a lot lately so these are
super-tiny bar earrings they have most
of their pieces in silver rose gold and
gold I used to only wear gold and I've
been kind of branching out into the
silver world lately i really liked these
are just super simple tiny bars oh I
also got them in gold apparently so here
is the exact same thing
Gold not super exciting this looks fun I
think I'm gonna keep these plastic bags
for like snacks for work it's not weird
ooh I really like this one I think it's
taking me more time to actually get
these on my body then fill me entire
video so this is what the next one looks
like I love this I don't know if I'd
wear with like a low cut shirt but I
would probably wear it with like a
higher neck shirt I don't know how would
you guys were this like this is really
unique glam but not too much you know
I'm saying I'm so freaking hungry right
now I usually only purchase bracelets
online when their cups that are bendable
because my wrist is super freaking small
literally no bracelets ever fitted it's
not been double so I think this one
could work farther up on my arm feel
like it might fall off yeah does Jess a
diamond-studded cuff I like these for
layering I usually wear my silver bull
misty are you sure where my silver watch
every day and I like to pair it with my
are they there in the bathroom I usually
paired with my love bracelets and I just
like layering it with pieces like this
okay so the next one this is like the
dinosaur of necklaces this thing is for
confuted flow it smells really good
that's weird so this is the last
necklace I love this on their website
they have a few like Instagram photos
that people have tagged wearing the
certain pieces you can see what they
look like on and actually saw someone
wearing this with the flannel and it
looked awesome I think this is gorgeous
they also had this in rose gold and gold
will heavy this is a workout alright so
my box is sadly empty I was everything i
got from bob of art it's kind of our
thing that name if you like this video
and you want to see more unboxing videos
give it a thumbs up so I know love you
guys thanks for watching and see you in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
