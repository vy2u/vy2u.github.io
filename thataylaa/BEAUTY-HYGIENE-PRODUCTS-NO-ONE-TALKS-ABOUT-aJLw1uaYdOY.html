a very fun topic I think it's fun get
your glass of wine for this one I was
tempted but it's 10:00 in the morning
figured we should probably stick with
coffee Cheers today we're going to be
talking about different kinds of beauty
hygiene products that I feel like aren't
talked about a lot these are just things
that will make your life easier will
make your body cleaner will make
everyone happier some of these products
I use on a daily basis some weekly I've
used some of these for years this is
going to be fun I actually really
enjoyed talking about this stuff my
family is very open I grew up not having
like a taboo around this kind of stuff
if you're younger I know growing up it
can be kind of hard to talk about this
stuff but there's really no shame in it
everyone has a body sometimes not the
most pleasant things come from our
bodies and that's just part of life and
hopefully these products help you out
with that let's start out easy and then
work our way in so very basic body wash
this body wash I actually love because
it's antifungal antibacterial and
antibody odor
you can get this off of Amazon it's tea
tree oil there's a hobo oil coconut oil
eucalyptus leaf lot of the body washes
that you can get at the drugstore or
Sephora wherever are actually
antibacterial so this is good for
washing your feet washing down there
this was actually an Amazon find it's 14
bucks and free shipping by the way all
the stuff I'm talking about will be
linked down below a lot of people says
this helps with athlete's foot eczema
ringworm toenail fungus body itch body
odor and acne so lots of good stuff in
here and it's all natural and it just
smells really good I think I love the
scent of tea trees let's talk about hair
removal I am a very hairy person I'm
Jewish hello
not only do I have a lot of hair but I
have very thick hair that grows back
really quick I can shave my legs at
night and I'll literally feel like
sandpaper the next morning so I try to
wax and use hair removal creams as much
as possible because I find that that
gives me a longer period of time between
when my hair starts growing back so I've
been using different hair removal
products for years I can't remember if I
ever talked about this in a video but my
freshman year of college I ordered
Amazon welcome to my life some hair
removal products for balding men it was
called like magic powder or something
there was a few bucks and it got really
good reviews you're supposed to use it
on your head if you're a bald man I put
it all over my body
stung
the entire dorm room not even our floor
but the entire building we had to
evacuate the building because everyone
thought there's a gas leak and it was
just my hair removal cream so hair
removal products and I go way back
I've tried out pretty much everything I
feel like at this point one of my
favorites is the nads sensitive hair
removal cream this guy right here this
is in collaboration with Mads you guys
know I only talk about products that I
genuinely believe in use and love I've
tried most of the main hair removal
creams and after using all those I can
say that this one definitely smells the
least bad it has melon aloe vera avocado
oil and honey in it so I feel like maybe
that's why it also says it has odor
elimination technology not going to
smell like roses no hair removal product
is but it definitely doesn't have the
really bad strong chemical scent that
will extinct up your entire apartment
the other thing I really like with this
is that with most hair removal creams
when you wash them off they're very sick
I just have to get a paper towel and
wipe it off and put the cream in my
trash can because it would like clog up
the drain this cream you can totally
just wash off in the shower it's not
super super thick and gum piece it's not
going to clog your drain or anything
this one just easily wipes away and
washes off and you're left with like
smooth skin since it is a cream it's
totally painless you just put on the
sick layer and I usually use this
actually on my arms I've been removing
hair from my arm since I lived in Jordan
my host mom the first week I was there
waxed my arms and strapped it to my host
mom lover you're supposed to leave it on
for a minimum of four minutes and not
exceeding ten minutes I leave it on for
the maximum time and I feel like that's
when I get the best results if you have
it on for four minutes and you're not
seeing anything happen definitely leave
it on a few more minutes
looking really great with my face mask
on right now but I'm just going to show
you guys really quick cousin as hair
removal cream works I have a little bit
of hair right here so I think you can
see this hopefully I've bond hair so
it's hard to pick up on camera but
there's hair all right here on my like
elbow areas behind my arms so I'm going
to put them on right here you just want
to do a thick layer without totally
rubbing it in all right so I'm gonna
leave it on for about eight to ten
minutes and I'll be back straight guys
so I just washed it off completely
smooth getting real
up-close-and-personal on my arm right
now but this is where I remove the hair
and then you can see where I stopped
right here there's hair
no more hair feeling good feeling soft
and it doesn't smell intense at all it
says you can use it on your legs arms
underarms and bikini lines I love using
this on my arms I also use it on my
bikini line and it does a great job down
there and on my skin doesn't irritate it
down there like leave me with any bumps
or anything and then you just wash it
off in the shower and that's it super
easy you can get to set Target Ulta and
certain pharmacies and it's usually
under ten bucks so while we're on the
hair-removal topics the next thing I use
is eyebrow razors you guys know I
freaking hate plucking my eyebrows I
have permanent brows on so it should
theoretically be easy because they
already have the shape I just literally
have to pluck the stray hairs it's just
one of those things that I dread doing
if anyone wants to come over and pluck
my eyebrows I'm taking volunteers really
is down there with like folding laundry
for me and a list of things I just love
but these make life way easier
especially if you have to go somewhere
and you don't have time to pluck your
eyebrows that's usually when I use these
they're a bunch of different brands of
eyebrow razors you can get them at Daiso
for super cheap but this is the tinkle
brand that I get off of Amazon you can
use each one for a while before you have
to toss them but basically on a clean
face I'll just go in and do like the top
of my brows and then also underneath
here just to clean it up and also use
these on your face if you have any peach
fuzz which I do hair does grow back but
I don't feel like it grows back thicker
than before I know it's a debate with
removing facial hair for me I don't
notice that it's any thicker or more
coarse it just removes the hair all
right next we're going to talk about
these guys this is the fresh and sexy
Playtex wipes you can get these off of
Amazon as well I get them in a double
pack so it comes with this in one other
packs it says that these are before and
after intimate wipes you know what I'm
saying but I actually use these just to
freshen up especially if you're on your
period you can be really nice to just
keep you clean and smelling good when
you actually smell them in the package
they smell really intense and that's
what I was reading on Amazon but when
you use them it's weird it cleans you
and it makes you smell good but it's not
overpowering at all so if you are using
these as like intimate wipes you don't
have to worry about having a super
overpowering scent down there so don't
get scared by what it smells like in
here when you open it because it is way
less intense when you actually put it on
I also use these as like underarm wipes
if you just want to freshen up
throughout the day or if you shower at
night and then you wake up in the
morning and
you just want to clean up a little bit
you can use these under your arms or I
do they're not technically made for that
but it works fine these are also
flushable they have skin conditioning
botanicals like cranberry chamomile and
a low and it's alcohol-free and
hypoallergenic I've tried a bunch of
different wipes you can also use baby
wipes I just feel like this one
definitely eliminates odor butter and
there's no shame with their on a couple
these in your purse just in case while
we're kind of on the underarm topic
these are really interesting I found
these on Amazon too because these are
basically underarm shields definitely
don't use you super frequently but I
thought they're really interesting to
mention if you are someone who gets
really sweaty they're essentially little
single packed pads that you actually
stick underneath your arms whether it's
on your shirt you could also stick it on
your bra so your bra goes up that high
like if you're wearing a sports bra or
something you just undo them peel off
the sticky part and then stick it on to
your shirt so on Amazon a lot of men
were writing reviews as well if you have
a presentation at work or school or
whatever and you don't want those really
great sweat stains we've all seen them
on people this could be a good fix for
you so I've used this stuff for a couple
years now this is the body shop
peppermint intensive foot rescue it
smells so freakin good this is basically
a foot cream so in the shower I'll use a
lamb I totally like doing the name of it
right now a pumice rock pumice sponge
just scrub the bottom of my feet and I'm
going to get out of the shower at night
I'll put this on I love the color of
this super pretty baby pink color and
when I wake up in the morning my feet
are just super soft they smell good just
in the last few years I have very dry
heels my mom does too I think it's just
something as I'm getting older I noticed
with this stuff I definitely noticed
that my feet are more moisturize and
less cracky if you have issues with your
shoes or feet smelling this also a spray
dr. Scholl's makes one that you just
spray into your shoes I have it it's
just like buried in my closet right now
but that can be great for like leather
flats I usually spray it in just so it
cuts out any of the odor so this next
product is bio oil and I feel like I
think most people have heard of this but
if not bio oil is just amazing for
putting on any kind of scars and stretch
marks on the back of here it says for
uneven skin tone stretch marks scars
dehydrate skin and aging skin I have
some stretch marks on my hip area which
I don't mind but I do put this on there
and also on my knee where I had knee
surgery it's kind of one of those cult
favorite products it has 4,000 reviews
Amazon and almost have five stars you
can also pick it up at the drugstore it
has an interesting spin it kind of
smells like chai tea this was making me
crave a chai latte right now when my
acne is totally gone I'm definitely
gonna start using this on my scarring on
my face to see if it helps because there
are some crazy before-and-after pictures
on Amazon of people's scars like totally
going down with this stuff
so those are all the products I wanted
to mention I hope you guys found this
