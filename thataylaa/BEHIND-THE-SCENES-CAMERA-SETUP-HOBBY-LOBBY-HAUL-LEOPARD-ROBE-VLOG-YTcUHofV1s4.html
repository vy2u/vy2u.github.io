first thing I'm saying holiday looking a
little funky right now because I have my
brows and half of my eyes done I'm about
to film my current skincare routine for
acne so that's why I'm not putting any
makeup on the face feel like that'd be a
little strange so I'm just about to film
this morning got the leopard robe on
ready to go thank you for all of your
super awesome comments on the last
leopard rub blog a leopard robe blog
link it over here if you haven't seen
that yeah you guys want a device to
continue so I figured we'll see what
happens usually like Saturday's my day
to literally film since I work
throughout the week so I usually film
for like four hours get stuff
pre-recorded and edited so I don't know
how much exciting is gonna happen
today but you never know took my coffee
out of the microwave and now I have zero
idea where I put it no satisfying thing
ever so healthy I don't know if you can
even tell back kind of tried to like
reshape my brows this morning I was
looking back at old videos and my brows
looked so much better and I was like
know what Taylor you need to fix that
 so I kind of went plucking crazy
and I totally reshaped my brows and then
I used the anastasia dipbrow in dark
brown to fill them in today I feel like
this color is like a little too ready
for me I don't know
hair is done I just saw an Instagram
post that on nostalgia nostalgia in the
stage of Beverly Hills is launching a
liquid matte lip collection what the
 do you mean my shirts because
that's exciting
I ordered a power adapter for my Canon
camera I just got an email saying that
is here which basically means that I
won't have to run outta battery mid
filming anymore because it just plugs in
and we're back so basically where I
would normally have a battery in right
now I have my AC adapter which just
plugs into a normal cord and this makes
it so the battery doesn't run out ever
when you're filming which is super nice
also this mic is new this is from Amazon
as well it's like super reasonable and
it got really good reviews link both of
those down below if you guys are curious
this basically is what it looks like
when I'm ready to go got a huge ass box
full of stuff that I'm mentioning my
face is on the computer saying telephone
focus let's do this
just finish filming I am starving and I
have to be I think I'm gonna put on some
foundation and then film my new
drugstore makeup haul because I still
have to get that up I don't know if I'm
gonna film putting on foundation
nothing's up for foundation I am mixing
the elf acne fighting foundation with
the L'Oreal new matte infallible
foundation Pro matte yeah that this one
is super matte like almost too matte for
me and this one is super dewy in too
dark so I'm just mixing the two and yeah
so far I like it only have it on this
half of my face obviously if you use the
cap of the Bath &amp;amp; Body Works candle it's
a really good way to mix your foundation
without getting it all over your hand
got my better Cheddar's getting the
party started it is already four o'clock
I just finished filming my drugstore
makeup haul I don't know where the heck
the day went I've then go to Hobby Lobby
and ups I think I'm still gonna get my
act together and go to UPS right now I
have to mail package and I think I'm
gonna get a peel box finally I feel like
I've just been sitting in the same chair
all day every time I turn on the vlog
camera thing so sorry on my lips right
now is colour-pop pencil in LBB
super pretty berry color really like it
I'm gonna get some food I'm go to UPS so
UPS door is already closed major fail
making salmon
and I really hope my phone does it fall
behind the oven salmon is the only thing
I like actually know how to cook I just
put a ton of butter and garlic salt
on it and it tastes good pressure you
can put butter and garlic salt on
anything you know tastes amazing oh yeah
bad news UPS is closed good news hobby
lobby's open till 8:00 p.m. actually
have to get stuff for like work work
which is the main reason why I'm going
but a girl can never have too much washi
tape you know I'm saying all right so
like usual got a bag of shape that I did
not need at all I'm looking for a mini
wedding mailboxes for this campaign I'm
doing at work and I cannot find them
anywhere so now I'm off to Michaels
Michaels no what is that Joanne's
if you live in Seattle or is the place
to be am i right
I was gonna vlog in Hobby Lobby but it
was poppin like there are so many people
in there and this happened I'm pretty
sure this milkshake is 90% whipped cream
alright so I'm gonna do a quick haul on
the ground and show you guys what I got
start with Hobby Lobby so Hobby Lobby
had 80% off their Christmas stuff they
actually had some stuff that wasn't
Christmassy at all so I got these bows
just for gifts and things left weird
gift bags I'm like a gift bag hoarder
I'm whole box of gift bags I don't need
to present I'm ready to go then I got
this washi tape that I showed you guys
they're probably gonna use this in my
Erin Condren anything of spray-paint I
got the mercury stream light side thing
going to put in the background of my
video so I'm gonna spray-paint the wire
white then I got this thing which I'm
super excited about literally everything
at Hobby Lobby was on sale I love this
kind of mercury glass look thing I've
gotten a few things from Hobby Lobby
that are like this and I thought this
would be cool to put my new sit on like
brushes in this was normally $20 on sale
for 10 doughnut Joanne's I got another
mercury glass thing this one was really
cool this is a mason jar and it was only
399 which I thought was super cheap whoa
something is really good hey Joanne's
was also having insane sales basically
both of these stores never buy anything
full price because they
rotate around their sales and everything
eventually goes on sale so Teresa
Collins was 40% off of things or half
off something like that letter sticker
is a black and white one also got pink
one getting ready for February
Valentine's Day Fiskars scissors I
thought these would be cool just to use
paper and like cut things for Erin
Condren all of their paper was five for
a dollar so I got five mostly polka dot
yeah why did I get something book at us
these are good for just cutting and
using and Erin Condren so then the last
thing these are kind of interesting
these are basically like knockoff Alex
and Annie and they were half off they
had a bunch of these I didn't know if it
was gonna be small enough for my wrist
or not I think I can adjust it to be
small enough $10 and then they are half
off so I got this for five bucks and
yeah basically like a knockoff Alex and
Ani bracelet or Alex and Annie whatever
the heck is called you never know what
you're gonna find that dran it yeah they
actually all fit and they look pretty
cool bracelet is a little bit big but I
think they can make it work it is
adjustable but it doesn't feel like it's
staying like that you know I'm saying I
think I'm gonna wrap up this leopard
rope vlog it's been real
if you like leopard rope blogs and you
want them to continue be sure to give
this video a thumbs up so I know love
you guys thanks for watching see you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
