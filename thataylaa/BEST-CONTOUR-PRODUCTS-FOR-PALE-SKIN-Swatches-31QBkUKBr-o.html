alright so the day is here today we're
going to be talking all about my
favorite contour products for pale skin
if you have very snug eyes this lipstick
is going to be a disaster not even 30
seconds in finding products that don't
look ashy or too orange or too dark on
fair complexions can be pretty tricky I
actually have a ton of products to share
with you guys today I've been collecting
and trying these out for a while now and
I just realized only three of them are
high-end so the rest of them are all
affordable drugstore products if you're
new here I have lots of videos for
people with pale skin I have a whole
playlist that I will link down below in
the description box foundation Fridays I
do every single Friday where I try out
different foundations to do 15 days of
foundation that lots of stuff so all of
it will be in the description box down
below if you are new I did a video on
this makeup all I did was change my lip
color and shirt because YouTube tricks
this is the Valentine's Day look I did
so that video will be going up oh that
video will be going up on Wednesday
sneak peek so if you guys are excited
for this video make sure you give it a
thumbs up if you want to see my favorite
contour products you're in the right
place just keep watching the good trick
if your pale skin is trying out eyebrow
products a lot of about I know a lot of
eyebrow powders come in light taupe II
kind of shades which is perfect for pale
skin that is what we are going for and
by the way I'm not talking about
bronzers or any kind of warm products in
this video this is just cool toned
contour products to contour your face so
one of my absolute favorites is the elf
eyebrow in the shade light this comes
with an eyebrow wax but this is the
shade that you want it contour with it's
what I'm wearing right now on my cheeks
not too warm but also doesn't look grey
you can build this up so you get more of
a chiseled kind of look or you can just
go more natural this is a few dollars I
actually had to order new and this one's
brand new which so I doesn't look that
used this guy was holding up the entire
video don't know where this went in the
move another eyebrow kit which you can
get at Sephora is the MU a professional
brand this shade right here also great
this one is a more ashy but I feel like
it blends out a little bit easier than
the elf products if I don't what is this
brush doing
I discovered this product randomly in my
hidden drugstore makeup video which I'll
leave in the little eye over here I
tried
in that video and I've been hooked on
this ever since I keep this in my
everyday makeup drawer I use this a lot
love this one this one I have to give a
mention this is the it cosmetics Michael
to face palette they actually redid this
I am not entirely positive it's the new
shade is exactly the same but I had to
mention this because I mean look at this
one I have hit pan on this shade it's a
great contour shades not quite as ashy
as the elf and the MUA eyebrow kit it
has a tiny bit more warmth to it blends
out super easily in this shade I
actually love it to highlight it looks
like nothing impressive at all in the
pan but it actually rocks I don't like
the white shade in here it's a little
bit - chalky but these two shades I
really do like in these ones you can
also use this eye shadow next up is the
Catrice prime and fine professional
contouring palette shade is great the
best way I can describe this is milk
chocolate much variation can I give in
description the thing I really like
about this is that it's super soft it
just blends out effortlessly Catrice you
can find at Ulta online and I believe
this is under like eight books so this
guy is new in my life but it is great
this is the Physicians Formula bronze
booster this is a new product in this
middle shade right here is perfection
this is almost identical to the Catrice
products they probably don't need both
pick one or the other I have to use this
one and if you literally just dip your
brush in it can work as more of a
bronzer it is definitely super warm this
is an honorable mention because this one
is actually not one of my favorites but
I know this is like a cult favorite this
is the NYX blush in taupe this is like
an old-school pale skin favorite feel
like there are so many more products out
on the market now that work that out of
all the ones I'm going to mention I
don't think I would say this one I just
feel like if I don't mention this every
comment is going to be about NYX hope
it's not bad it's not bad at all it
totally works if you have it use it I do
like it I just feel like there are
better ones out there but this one
definitely works in it's under 10 bucks
next up is a makeup geek product and if
you haven't tried makeup geek contour
products they blend super easily they're
super soft but they are very pigmented
which is the reason why I don't reach
for this one as much as some of the
others but I have it in the makeup geek
palette here ever warm tone shade and
the cool toned one this one is the shade
I want to mention this is breakup this
one can easily look too muddy you have
to use a super light hand with this the
warmish ages love triangle this one
pulls super orange on me if you don't
work for other people but for some
reason on my skin tone it looks orange
but break up can be nice if you use it
sparingly along the lines of the makeup
geek color this is the city color
collection contour palette this shade
right here is light enough it can just
very easily look muddy but again if you
use a light hand it can work and the
thing I like about this is it is so
freakin soft it literally feels like
velvet this next one is another one of
my most resource shades this is the
morphe 9c palette this actually shocked
me because it doesn't look like it's
going to work the shade looks a little
bit and there we go man down it looks
like it would be a little bit too dark
in the pan but this is perfect this is
like my go-to from not using one of the
eyebrow kits this is usually what I
reach for comedians have the perfect
amount of pigment in them they're super
easy to blend out super soft I also
really like using the other shades in
here as eyeshadows this is a nice
transition shade if you want a little
bit more of a warmer contour this one
also works another kind of cult favorite
is the mask blush in taupe I actually
prefer baby don't go which is a little
bit warmer it but it doesn't look orange
II it doesn't pull super warm on my skin
so if you don't want that super cool
tone contour this one still works for
contour it's not quite a bronzer but
it's definitely a warmer as you can buy
I believe just in the pan now I don't
know why but it's not in the pan next up
is the Too Faced cocoa contour palette
this is one that weirdly looks cooler in
the pan than when you actually put it on
your face it looks super cool toned in
here the medium cocoa shade but on my
skin it looks a little bit warm a little
bit warmer than I like if you want
something high-end and that's a little
bit warm toned I think this one could be
worth it but honestly I think the
drugstore options are just as good
price-wise even though you get four
shades in here for me I never touch any
of the other shades so it doesn't really
make it worth it to me you also get a
really nice brush that I've never used
as probably this brush this pop of light
shade in here it's pretty much worthless
it's like a sheer glitter when our
brands going to stop putting glitter in
highlights I don't get it this is the LA
girl
no la colors I love makeup contour
palette two shades in here that I'm
going to swatch look pretty similar to
the Too Faced one so if you want to go
with a drugstore version
you like the shade of two-faced you go
for this one these are soft easy to
blend out you get eight pans in here
which is really great I also got this
one on I Kate house and I want to say it
was around ten bucks last product I'm
going to mention is the l'oreal
infallible pro contour in the shade 813
light i like the tone of this one a lot
I like the shade it is a little bit
tricky for me I don't get a whole lot of
product on the brush when I pick it up
so you kind of have to build it up but
if you want something pretty sheer and
not super pigmented you might like this
one I think out of all these this is the
least pigmented but I do like the tone
of this product
I feel like that just went by really
fast how much can you say about the same
shade 15 times so those are all my
favorite products like I said I think my
go-to s are the elf eyebrow kit the MUA
eyebrow kit the morphe palette and
Catrice those are my most reach for ones
at least in the last few months so I
hope you guys liked this video and found
