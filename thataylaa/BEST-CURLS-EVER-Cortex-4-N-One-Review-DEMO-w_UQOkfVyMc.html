this guy this is the cortex four-in-one
curling iron the box looks like this
very nice I was in the market for a new
curling iron because I had left mine in
Israel and so I started doing some
research and I found this was in contact
with flat iron experts calm they sent me
this for review obviously all my
opinions are my own I don't have to say
good things about it I'm telling you my
honest thoughts so this is great because
it is 4 in 1 so you get four different
sizes you get the 1 inch 3/4 of an inch
one and 1/4 in one and a half so you get
different sizes you can use them on the
same look and do like tighter ones up
top or if you just want like a really
flowy loose like Kim Kardashian wave you
can use the big one which is my personal
favorite it gets up to 430 degrees and
just so you know this is a 1 so that
means it doesn't have like clip so it
comes with the cortex glove which
reminds me of like the Beyonce single
ladies look or you can just have spirit
fingers it comes with this glove so you
can hold it with one hand curl it around
with the other hand and then your hand
doesn't get burned like mine always do
so this thing is great of the glove
thereand so it gets up to 430 degrees
and it's cool because as it's getting
hotter it you can see it like going up
and this thing literally gets to the
temperature you want in no joke 20
seconds tops it's a hundred percent
tourmaline ceramic that has an
interchangeable handle so all you do to
switch heads is you just press - so kind
of hot because I just used it but you
just press these buttons and pull up and
it comes right off and I just take the
other one on super easy it also has a
like swivel cord which is really awesome
you know when you just get caught in
your cord or does that just happen to me
it just turns in his fun I also sent
this thermal shine spray which at first
I was like
you know need a new spray I got my
products but then I tried this on Laura
my friend who you will see in the demo
video and oh my god it smells like man
it smells like hot Abercrombie man
smells exactly like the mahogany teak
wood candle from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works like
ash one spray this as like my perfume
and it also makes your hair look super
shiny and healthy thumb so I actually
really like this stuff both of these you
can get at flatiron experts.com I'll put
the link down below this retails for
it's usually $150 for all for like this
whole set but on flat iron experts you
can get it for 99 on sale and then right
now like right now if you get it within
a day I think their fall sales going on
so you can get this whole thing or
anything on their site for 20% off the
coat is fall so that's an awesome deal I
would definitely take advantage of this
right now and why did the colors just
get so dark so if you open up the box it
looks like this this is obviously where
the big the big guy came there is
warranty that comes with this register
your product within 90 days to receive
okay they spelled purchase massively
wrong just trust me I just saw your
project within 90 days to receive your a
lifetime warranty so that's cool so if
it breaks or you're not happy with it
whatever you can get a new one the hair
I have right now i curled with 3/4 inch
barrel I just love love love the way it
curls my hair it's small enough where I
can like get my bangs and then it still
looks like you know real hair and you
will see how Laura's hair curls with the
bigger wand as well just literally have
nothing bad to say about it I don't know
so if you want to see the demo here we
go
see how the black thing yeah oh my god I
like so get it oh my god
stay what's wrong with you Oh like man
oh my god your mom like sent you
something but I was like really weird
chemicals all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
