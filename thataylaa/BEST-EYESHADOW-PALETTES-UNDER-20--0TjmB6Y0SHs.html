talking about my top I shadow palette
recommendations under 20 bucks one time
I wear color and you can't even see it
here it is so I did a video fairly
recently on my eyeshadow palette I
regret buying so today we're talking
about once I actually like you want to
see a high-end pella version of this let
me know down below but these are just
ones that you can find online or in the
drugstore for under 20 bucks so if
you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you
want to stick around you can subscribe I
upload every Monday Wednesday Friday 6
p.m. Pacific time this week no next week
there's gonna be four videos so Monday
Tuesday Wednesday Friday here we go
favorite palettes under 20 bucks all
right so these are in no order
whatsoever but this just happens to be
the cheapest one out of all the ones I'm
gonna be talking about these are the new
wet and wild color icon palette so in
the past wet and wild palettes have
looked like this they recently kind of
repackage them these are different
formulas I think I still love this
palette this is like one of those og
palette I've had I this definitely needs
to be tossed or something because it's
for sure expired this fellow abused for
years and loved I've always had a little
thing for wet and wild eyeshadows I
think they're great options from the
drugstore and these two new palettes
that they came out with this one is not
a basic peach and then this one is rose
a in the air these are both awesome they
retail for $4.99 each which I mean come
on you can't beat that
this one the shades obviously looked
pretty similar to the Anastacio modern
renaissance palette this one I'm wearing
on my eyes right now so all of the matte
shades that I'm wearing are from this
palette today the yellow is from a
different palette I talked about but the
blue down here I used and then the matte
brown shades they're just so pigmented
they don't blend away that's like my one
thing with eyeshadows is that I like my
eyeshadow step okay it'd be easy to
blend easy to work with but to not be
too powdery and to not blend away that's
usually what I look for in shadows I
like them to have a little bit of a grip
to them because I find that for me
that's just how I can get the best kind
of eye look with it that's what these
ones do for me I love the matte shades
in here I just feel like you can get a
really nice blended look with these and
for five bucks really great option from
the drugstore and wet and wild does a
lot of sales so wet and wild at the
drugstore you can almost always find a
40% off buy one get one half off so
always wait for it to go on sale be
you'd be able to get these for what
around three bucks on sale I'm pretty
sure I have videos either wearing or
using all these pallets I'm talking
about so you can always just search the
name of any product and the tailor and
YouTube and if I have a video wearing it
it'll come up because I put everything
in the description box so if you want to
see what any of these look like on or
see them in action or whatever check out
that video I'm not doing foundation
foundation swatches wow I'm on autopilot
I'm not doing eyeshadow swatches like on
my arm or anything in this video because
I just don't find eyeshadow swatches to
be that helpful because shadows just
look totally different on your eyes and
depending on how you apply them with a
brush or with your finger wet dry but I
will kind of finger swatch a few here
and there for you guys so here are some
from the NADA base of peach palette wow
I'm gonna need like 10,000 wipes in this
video and then let's do I love this
shade in this palette this is like the
camel brown color I always go for by the
way the shadows I'm itching this video
our favorites regardless of their price
it's a bonus that they're under $20 but
these aren't just like good for the
price these are just generally good
eyeshadows in my opinion some of the
palettes I'm talking about in this video
are better than a lot of my high-end
pallets better than busy art for sure in
my opinion guys know how I feel about
busy art so this next palette is by an
indie brand when I was going through all
of my palettes for this video what I did
was kind of just put all my favorites in
a pile and then I looked up to see the
prices I did not think this one was
gonna be under $20 it's actually 18
bucks this is the siharan by joe vias
place palette and this one I am so in
love with like the color ski ski I
always have such a hard time saying this
word shh-shh game she oh man
color schemes right anyway it's really
like the color assortment in this
palette there's something about this I
don't know if it's just like that
packaging and everything there's
something so visually appealing about
this palette to me but I love this shade
right here it's like that super pretty
greenish gold kind of shade the matte
shades and the shimmer shades in here
are just really nice and pigmented look
at those look at this shade this one
just speaks to me Sokoto such a nice
bright orange kind of shade 18 bucks
inner supporting a smaller business I
definitely want to try more palace by
dubious place I actually think I might
have got this one on hot luck or
something sometimes they're on hot look
for even cheaper so you might be able to
get this for under 18 bucks you don't
get a lot of fallout just over
all great formula for 18 bucks pretty
good price almost just drop that so this
next fella is one that has quickly grown
on me
beige cosmetics in my opinion makes some
of the best affordable eyeshadow
palettes they always go on sale so BH
Cosmetics again is one of those ones
that I probably wouldn't buy if it's not
on sale because they always knock down
all of their products at some point so
just wait for it to go on sale but right
now when I'm filming this you can get
this for $11 it normally retails for $18
11 bucks right here so this palette they
have a normal festival palette this is
the weekend festival palette I've worn
this in a few videos recently these just
have insane payoff especially like it's
hard to do a matte teal shade like this
or this goal of the yellowy shade right
here in the Amazon Alexa orders my
makeup video I've used these teal ones
in a video to have use this shade
carnival abroad a bunch these in
different videos so again just search it
if you want to see what they look like
on you're looking for that palette that
has a pop of color and it has a good mix
of matte pops of color and shimmer pops
of color this one is the way to go I
also have a few other ones from BH
Cosmetics in this video I have a few
favorite eyeshadow palettes by morphe
but the ones that I really like like the
Jacqueline Hill one is one of my
favorites and the limited edition that
holiday one can't think of the name off
the top of my head they don't make it
anymore but those two are my favorites
by morphe those ones aren't under $20
but I have two here that are great
options for under $20 the packaging of
these feel so nice and heavy their new
formulas and packaging are totally
different and are legit in my opinion
this one is the 15n so this one you're
gonna get a little bit more cool tones
in here and then this one base layer is
15 d this one is very warm the only
thing I don't like about this palette is
that on my skin tone I can't get kind of
a comprehensive look with this because
there's just not enough light shades in
here to use as like the transition and
on my inner corner so this one is like
definitely one of those palettes that I
have to use in combination with another
thing but so are most of these palettes
I feel like this would be a nice summer
warm bronzy kind of palette and then let
me do a couple from the other one I've
already gone through two full wipes this
shade unique in the other palette oh my
god this is such a pretty shade this
would be a good wedding makeup shade I
really need to do the wedding makeup
video but this palette is really nice if
you're more into a little bit more cool
tones which I am right now I've been way
more leaning towards cool tones
on an everyday basis then warm tones
which is kind of ironic because we're
coming to summer here they're soft super
metallic the mass blend out they're
pigmented I don't know what other
adjectives I can use to describe
eyeshadows in this video I have like a
pyramid of eyeshadows right now that are
definitely gonna fall at some point so
next - I mentioned in my thing though
the last raised in rejects video whoa
that's kind of trippy I'm so in love
with these palettes these are the two
new Milani palettes I'm gonna try not to
totally blind you but this one is the
bold obsessions and then we have the
most loved matte so both of these retail
for $20 imma Lonnie's website I've only
found this in my area on milania's
website I did order both these from
there but I've heard from you guys that
you can get them at Walmart for $15
these look like Tarte palettes to me
everything about these palettes from the
actual quality of the eyeshadows to the
packaging just everything I love love
that they have a light cream shade right
here that is light enough to use on my
lids they have some nice transition
shades in here you can actually get a
really cool toned look with this using
some of the kind of mauve purple tones
in here these are definitely one of the
better drugstore releases release words
are rough today releases that's ever
come out again this shade I feel like
it's a really pretty wedding each kind
of shade look at that oh yeah I know I'm
doing this with my bad hand right now
this feels weird
here are some of the metallic shades and
here's a few of the mattes both of these
Monte palettes I like better than Tarte
palettes have used in past they feel
like high-end palettes they look like
Cayenne pellets but they're drugstore
this is one of those palettes that I've
been talking about for years on my
channel now and I feel like this is so
friggin underrated this is the BH
Cosmetics foil eyes palette again this
is one of those pallets that they have
matte versions of this that I'm not a
fan of but the foil eye one you need and
right now when I'm filming this this is
on sale for eight dollars eight dollars
for this palette it's normally $13.99
which is still an amazing price
pigmentation in these are insane they
give you that super metallic kind of
look on their own but also if you wet
your brush and use these like just spray
some setting spray mac fix+ whatever and
you can get even more insane color but
look at that blue I have videos wearing
the blue one I have tons of videos
wearing this palette thing I like about
this palette is that you have these
crazy pops in some kind of different
shades like this metallic kind of mint
green one but then you also have more
neutrals
here and then you have these light ones
up here I feel like this is just a good
palette to have if you like metallic
shadows and eight bucks folks eight
bucks so it's probably really love and
Mike sorry about that so bad habit you
can find on shop hush and they're kind
of known for doing dupes of pallets I
actually really did not like one of the
dupes I tried in the subculture palette
video where I was comparing the makeup
revolution one and one of the bad habit
ones I'll link that video on the eye but
in that video a bunch of guys were like
you need to try out other palettes buy
them because they have some bomb ones
this palette you can get for $12 it is a
dupe for the anastacio prism palette
this one I like because there are just
some very unique unique as I'm saying as
it's a dupe but there are just some
really cool tones in here that I don't
have a whole lot like this is one of my
favorite shades in here I have a video
using this shade right now the yellow on
my eyes that you're seeing on my lids is
this one right here you do have to build
up this yellow quite a bit but I just
find the best way is to Pat using your
finger just Pat it on do a couple layers
these are ones that if you're using the
shimmery shades they can have a bit of a
fallout they are a little bit more
powdery than what I usually like so I
would recommend wetting your brush if
you're gonna be using these just so you
don't have a ton of fallout all over but
they are very pigmented
I like the colors in here I find that
the matte ones and the shimmer shades in
here I can use I like it's the next step
is a color pop eyeshadow color pop
obviously makes them great affordable
shadows this one is just my most reach
for palette that they've come out with
this is the you had me at hello palette
this palette retails for $18 I think
again because there are some cool tones
in here and I'm just really into that
right now but I love the light shade in
here that one is so pretty can you tell
I have a thing for this tone right here
here a few of them I like that they have
kind of more basic oh yeah just
totally dug money on that I like that
they have kind of just four basic shades
right here that you can pretty much
create any liquids and then just go in
with the shimmer shades in this palette
so I do feel like this is one that if
you want one palette that you can create
a full look what this would be that you
could put this on the inner corner you
could use this dark shade to kind of
smooth things out deepen it up if you
don't want to try a color pop palette
and you just don't really know where to
start this could be a good option okay
so these last two if we're being real
technical are technically not under $20
they retail for $22 but they're BH
Cosmetics and like I said BH Cosmetics
always goes on
sale and I've seen both of these pallets
for around eleven to fourteen dollars so
you definitely can get these under $20
like way under $20 which is why I still
wanted to include it so let's just chill
it's okay
both of these I talked about a shit-ton
this is the BH Cosmetics zodiac palette
this is one of my all-time favorite
palettes just because I love the matte
shades in here
I love the shimmer shades in here I just
feel like you can get so many different
looks with this palette mats are so soft
it's one of those palettes that it
actually looks pretty friggin similar to
this on your actual I that is how
metallic and insane they are and for if
you can get it for around 15 bucks or
under what you can
this is bomb and then last is the BH
Cosmetics Carli bybel a deluxe edition
palette again I've used and talked about
this so many times my mirror actually
cracked because I'm pretty sure I
brought this traveling and it broke but
this is like a romantic shadow kind of
palette for me I feel like if you're
doing any kind of like date makeup
Valentine's Day you have more cool tones
in here but then there are still some
warm tones these ones I don't like his
face highlighters just for what I
usually like because I do like more of
Sheen rather than like a italic face
highlight but you can use these as
eyeshadows to I just feel like every
time I've done my shadow with this
palette I like how it turns out I don't
have to worry about anything with this
they just somehow always work and they
always blend together and they always
look good and it's freaking marble
packaging so that's always a plus those
are all of my recommendations for
palettes under 20 bucks if you guys have
any others that you really enjoy under
$20 let me know what they are down below
I'm have everything I talked about
linked down below and the makeup I'm
wearing right now but I'll just quickly
go through it I told you guys what's on
my eyes my lashes are the aisle or
corner lashes 0:05 I tried this
foundation combo today which I'm also
kind of obsessed with I hope this works
well throughout today because I really
like this so far I mentioned this in the
oily skin video but this is the Estee
Lauder Double Wear maximum cover and
mixed it in with the lorac natural
performance which is one of my favorite
foundations if I want kind of more
medium coverage it's np-1 this just
gives any foundation that really pretty
skin like glowy look so these two mixed
together I'm really feeling for a face
highlight today I used the soap &amp;amp; Glory
love at first blush this is like a very
pinky one but then you can also just go
in with this light white Shea
kind of hit the high points right there
for bronze are used it's literally at
the bottom of my eyeshadow stack right
now let's let's try uh-oh oh no oh yeah
okay bye-bye pours bronzer and then
blush I used to face Papa don't peach
lips I used l'oreal infallible
tongue-tied I feel like I'm forgetting
something
okay as I'm posing for thumbnails I just
remembered the thing I forgot in my eyes
I used to steal a diamond desk glitter
just right on the center it was
forgetting something but if you enjoyed
this video you can give it a thumbs up I
love you guys thanks for watching see
you my next video bye I feel like
overall uh where are they going with
that sentence of an indie brand what the
heck you know and your phone dings and
then nothing pops up that drives me
crazy you can get either online or at
the drugstore and that's yeah that's
usually where you can buy things whoa
that was a giant ass bird that just flew
