some like drool action going on and
stuff alright so today it's foundation
Friday this week we're actually gonna be
talking about my favorite foundations
for oily skin so if you're new here I
just recently got off of a keychain but
before that I had acne an oily skin for
years so I have had lots of time to try
out different foundations for oily skin
I had pretty oily skin I would get like
the greaseball face within a few hours
with a lot of foundations I never got
around to making this video when I had
oily skin so here we are today I will be
doing one for dry skin eventually but I
feel like I've only had dry skin for
under a year so far so I just want to
wait a little bit longer so I can try
different products and kind of find more
that I really like the foundations I'm
mentioning in this video I have used on
oily skin it's not just me saying right
now I think these foundations might be
good for oily skin these are ones that
are like very much tried tested I
recommend for oily skin I videos using
every single one of these foundations so
if you want to check them out all you
have to do is search the name of any
foundation and the Tayla and if I have a
video on it
it'll pop up and you can watch it there
are mix of different finishes and
coverage just depending on what you like
so I'm just gonna go through them all if
you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the burrito family
and subscribe upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time so
it is so rare to find a foundation that
has every single thing that you want in
it that it controls their oil that is
the right shade that has the right
finish that you like the right coverage
it's really hard to find all those
things in one so a lot of these
foundations I would use for mixing with
other foundations the foundations I
mentioning today are what I would say
are more oil controlling foundations so
you can wear these alone if you can find
a shade and everything and you like the
coverage of it on its own or you can mix
these in with other foundations to help
control the oil also the primers you use
powder and setting spray can have a huge
impact on overall how your foundation
looks sometimes setting spray can just
totally transform a foundation if you
have oily skin primer can totally
transform your skin alright so the first
one which is definitely in my top out of
the top is the Too Faced peach perfect
comfort matte foundation this foundation
retails for $36 and now it does come in
20 shades they Reece
only expanded the shade range on this I
have the shade snow which was the old
lightest shade and this one is too dark
and too yellow so I did just by Swan
it's still coming in the mail so I can't
show it but hopefully that's a better
shade match for me G right here is
actually the two based peach perfect
foundation between filming this video
and then filming the swatches right now
I did get the lightest shape that I
ordered in the mail so this is the new
lightest shade Swan and then next to it
right here is the shade snow so it's not
a whole lot lighter and it still is
pretty yellow so kind of bummed about
that I mean if you look at it compared
to some of these other light shades this
is still not very fair so that's the new
lightest shade of the two face this is
one of those foundations that just
totally blew my mind
solid medium coverage you can build this
one up to get pretty good coverage thing
I love about this is that it truly is
oil controlling but it doesn't look
heavy it doesn't look cakey it looks
like skin and it is friggin transfer
proof this is one of the few foundations
I've found that is truly transfer proof
if you are worried about like your
foundation coming off when you hug
people
if being transferred proof is important
to you check out this foundation it
keeps your face looking pretty much the
same throughout the day as far as oil
goes when I had acne and oily skin this
wasn't enough coverage for me on its own
unless I really built it up so I did
like mixing this in with something that
had a little bit more coverage but if
you like soft kind of satin matte finish
that's transfer proof and medium
coverage get this foundation so this
next product is technically a BB cream
I've talked about this for a long time
now I feel like out of everything I'm
mentioning this is the most oil
controlling by covergirl is to clean
matte BB cream this BB cream is so
freakin amazing at controlling oil
whether it's on its own whether you mix
it in with the foundation this is like a
perfect oil controlling mixing product
the lightest shade 510 is way too dark
for my skin tone so I've always had to
mix this I can't wear it on its own
unless I have on like a self-tanner or
something this only comes in six shades
which is obviously very shitty
CoverGirl's lightest shades are always
way too dark covergirl needs to
seriously work on their shade range on
both ends of the spectrum they recently
rebranded so if you're trying to find
this now the outside packaging is gonna
look different
get this for around seven dollars
depending on where you get it as solid
medium coverage it gives you a
beautiful soft matte finish where again
it doesn't look heavy it doesn't look
cakey at all keeps your oils at bay
makes your foundation look great
throughout the day awesome product
alright so this next one is one that I
feel like I did a video on and then I
don't think I've ever talked about it
again since then but I have continued to
use it again since then when I had oily
skin this is the Estee Lauder Double
Wear maximum cover so this isn't the you
know original double where they have
different versions of double when I
filmed this video the lightest shade was
1 &amp;amp; 3 which is way dark when I went to
check the price and everything for this
video right now I noticed that they
actually expanded the shade range they
now have 16 shades in the lightest shade
is now 1c one cool bone so that's super
exciting I'm definitely gonna be
ordering the lightest shade now 1c one
this foundation retails for $42 for
controlling oil and adding coverage this
has full coverage when I had acne it
covered everything amazing coverage it
doesn't look as thick and cakey as the
Double Wear this definitely has more
coverage than the Estee Lauder Double
Wear I can't remember what foundation I
mixed in with this to lighten at that
particular day but when I wore this to
China I were on that plane flight which
what was I think it was like a 18 hour
trip or something that I was traveling
my foundation was still on I was not a
greaseball by the end of those 18 hours
or whatever I also want to say this one
ranked pretty low like in the middle of
one of the 15 days of foundation series
this is one of those products that as I
kept using it and trying it different
ways and stuff it did grow on me and I
did find ways that I really liked it
mixed in with stuff it could be really
great so if you tried the Estee Lauder
Double Wear and you weren't a fan of it
for one reason or another and you want
more coverage try this one so this next
foundation is one that this reminds me
just of like OG youtube because I used
to wear this a lot this was like one of
my go-to foundations I don't know if it
was before I started my channel or maybe
right at the beginning but this is the
Rimmel stay matte so this foundation
breaks me out which is why I stopped
using it the whole Rimmel stay matte
line breaks me out but it is awesome for
controlling oil if it doesn't break you
out so the powder actually works if you
have oily skin and you haven't tried
that powder try it just be aware of your
skin and if it's obviously causing you
to breakout but this is a drugstore
foundation it's around five dollars it
says it's lightweight shine control and
it's a mousse foundation and I do feel
like it's all of those if this
is to kind of Matt looking or you don't
like the finish of it you can always use
a product like this and just mix in
something a little bit duir like you
could even mix in CYO lifeproof with
this also drugstore you'd have a what
this would be like a $14 combo here less
than that so if you can't find a
foundation that's within your budget and
has everything that you want just make
something else in with it to create the
perfect combo this next foundation is
the makeup forever matte velvet plus
this is kind of like another one those
og foundations is foundation retails for
$41 and it comes in 19 shades this
foundation I would say is solid medium
coverage it does have that smooth kind
of soft focus matte finish which is why
I really like it if I'm going for a
matte finish whether I have dry skin now
or oily skin I like products that don't
feel too heavy that don't look too cakey
there are a lot of matte foundations
that can do that on my skin so these
ones I'm mentioning if they haven't
matte finish they don't do that for me
this foundation the only thing I don't
like is that it does oxidize a lot so I
have the shade number 15 which looks
great when I first put it on but then it
does darken just keep that in mind that
it might opt eyes on you I also like the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation I
really don't like the original HD
foundation that one looks horrible on my
skin the Ultra HD is nice if you like
more of a satin finish this one though I
would say is definitely more oil
controlling and for oily skin you know
these get samples at Sephora too so if
you don't want to commit to one of these
high-end foundation as i mentioning just
walk into your sephora ask for a little
sample and they should give you them all
right so this next foundation if you've
watched my channel for a long time you
probably knew this one was gonna be in
here this is the pur cosmetics bear doll
foundation this was my go-to favorite
foundation for a while I'm actually
almost out of this tube right here at
the foundation retails for $39 and it
comes in ten shades I use the lightest
shade which is porcelain and that's a
pretty good shade match for me so I
didn't have to mix this one when I would
wear it you can build up the coverage
with this to get really great coverage
but I feel like the finish and coverage
of this are totally totally dependent on
the way that you're applying it so I
like to use a brush with this one that
gave me the best coverage and I would
build it up on certain areas to get more
coverage it also really depended on the
skin day I was having I found some days
this made my skin look for again amazing
but if I was having a skin day where for
whatever reason this was
sitting the best on my skin so I don't
know what variable is there were there
but overall this is one of my go-to
foundations and I had oily skin and give
me the greaseball look throughout the
day and had good coverage good shade so
I did reach for this one I should turn
when I had all of these skin so if you
are a full coverage matte kind of gal or
guy then this one is for you this is the
jus a essential high coverage cream
foundation so this retails for $38 and
they actually recently expanded the
shade range of this one to there are
fifty shades in this foundation which is
so freakin amazing
good job Jay if you have acne if you
have rosacea if you have any kind of
major scarring or anything to cover up
this will do it too it's not a thick
foundation it is matte but it's more of
a soft matte finish it doesn't feel
super heavy on the skin it wears amazing
throughout the day the only thing I
found with this one is that I do get a
little bit of creasing here and there
with this one so you do need to use
something like something like the
Smashbox primer water really helps
underneath or definitely using a setting
spray on top I mean I use a setting
spray on top of all of my foundations
weather had oily skin or dry skin this
has very high coverage it's definitely
up there with like the Estee Lauder
Double Wear maximum I think these two
one other one I'm gonna mention has
similar coverage but these two so far
are definitely the most coverage out of
all these I'm mentioning I'm actually
wearing this today in the shade
alabaster mixed in with the Estee Lauder
Double Wear nude makeup in 1c one cool
bone so this one's a little bit dark
this one's way too light so when I mix
these together it's a good shade and it
gives me at the coverage in that matte
look but then adding this one and just
makes it look a little bit more dewy in
skin like so I can actually still use
this one with my dry skin just mixed in
different ways as far as shade match for
me now I've found that bisque is the
closest shade match they sent all 50
shades in PR these little jars so I've
been able to try the different shades
there's a foundation are these two
swatches so here's alabaster and then
here is bisque and if I was buying just
this one to wear on its own I probably
go for bits just to give you some shade
reference if you're around my skintone
so these next two foundations aren't
ones that I would say are as oil
controlling as the other foundations
I've mentioned so far but these ones
work on oily skin and can really work
depending on again what you wear
underneath and over it but this
foundation is one of the only
foundations that I can really recommend
for any skin type this is the dermablend
smooth liquid camo foundation this
retails for $38 it comes in 14 shades
the shade range in this sucks I have the
two lightest shades which almost look
identical they look pretty similar and
they're both way too dark so I do have
to mix this one any time I use it this
looks beautiful on dry skin looks
beautiful and oily skin it does have
more of a satin dewy kind of finish
which can be pretty hard for oily skin
if that is the finish that you like
because most foundations that are more
dewy are obviously gonna make you look
more oily throughout the day but if you
mix this in with something and you want
that skin like kind of dewy look it's
gonna give you that look but it's not
gonna make you super oily throughout the
day at least on my skin this one I find
you can build up to full coverage off
the bat just off of one layer I would
say it's closer to medium coverage again
depending on how you apply it how much
you use and everything you can build
this up to have really good coverage and
it just is the most skin like flattering
finish out of all these ones I
mentioning for sure this day this is one
of my most reached for foundations and
it has worked for me as my skin has kind
of changed and transformed so the other
one kind of along that effect is a
drugstore foundation this is the
covergirl vitalist health elixir
foundation this foundation retails for
around nine or ten bucks it comes in
fourteen shades I have the lightest
shade which is 705 ivory and again
covergirl
what the heck way too dark for being a
lighter shade it says this is ivory well
I really along the lines of the
dermablend it just gives you the most
beautiful dewy satin kind of look it
looks like skin it didn't make my oil
necessarily worse throughout the day so
if you want that dewy look but you have
oily skin give this foundation to go it
wears really great they're like sweating
and working out and stuff too it sounds
pretty good coverage too you can build
us up to about a lo full coverage so if
you're someone who doesn't like the
matte situation you might like this way
so this next foundation is the Marc
Jacobs remarkable I think this might be
the priciest yeah this is the priciest
foundation and of all these at $55 it
comes in 22 shades I have the lightest
touchet's 10 and 12 there's a big shade
jump between number 10 and number 12
so I usually have to mix these two
shades to get my correct shade
here's Mark Jacobs remarkable in the
lightest shade 10 I couldn't find my 12
shade but I would say it's actually
pretty similar to like this shade right
here if not a little
darker this foundation can be a little
bit finicky but I wanted to mention it
because if you can find a way that works
for your skin holds up really well
throughout the day and it can look
really beautiful and it has amazing
coverage this is the other foundation I
was talking about that's up there and
coverage with these two really bum
coverage definitely can cover acne and
anything I hate the packaging of this I
mean it's like what is happening here
the foundation gets everywhere you need
a drop of this foundation a little bit
goes a long way so this is gonna last
you forever but this foundation I did
have to really work with to figure out
what looked best for my skin because it
can look too cakey so the way that I
really like to apply it is using the
Smashbox primer water I would put this
on underneath and over my makeup this
thing also lasts really well remember
taking a nap in this and I was shocked
that when I woke up my face looked
exactly the same I'm like I'm not a
pretty sleeper you know we got some like
drool action going on and stuff and this
is this is drool proof right here again
I would usually mix in something to make
it look a little bit more like skin
because it can look cakey really fast so
just play around this try mixing it with
different things try different powders
and setting sprays and stuff and I feel
like if you can make this one work it's
worth it just because of the coverage
and how long it lasts last one and then
I have one kind of honorable mention
that I wanted to mention so this is the
CYO matte foundation no shine zone CYO
does something right with their
foundations let me tell you you guys
know that this uio long-lasting
lifeproof is definitely in like my top
three foundations of all time this one
reminds me actually a lot of this when
it first goes on the HD liquid coverage
drops this foundation is only six bucks
but it only comes in six shades again
they have the numbers kind of jumping
around like the lightest shade is 203 so
I do feel like hopefully they'll
eventually expand the shade range with
this because the lightest shade 203 is a
joke it's actually really similar to the
lightest shade of this one which both of
these are very dark dyo matte foundation
in their current lightest shade two zero
threes when I did have to mix but it
gives you again that soft focused matte
look full coverage but it doesn't look
heavy it doesn't look cakey and it does
last great throughout the day with oily
skin so if you need a more affordable
option if you can make this work with
a white mixer or a different foundation
or whatever to lighten it or maybe
there's a shade that matches you in
those six shades then this one could be
worth giving a go true full coverage
foundations are hard to find at the
drugstore this is definitely one of the
highest coverage foundations I've found
at the drug store you can get CYO
on Walgreens alright and then this last
guy is the honorable mentions this is
what I'm wearing right now mixed in with
de jouer one the Estee Lauder Double
Wear nude in the shade one c1 this one I
did want to mention because again it's
kind of along the lines of the covergirl
where I wouldn't say at all it's an oil
controlling foundation like some of
these other ones but you can wear it for
oily skin and I don't feel like it
necessarily made my oily skin worse and
that can be really tricky to find for a
dewy foundation so this is a dewy glowy
lighter coverage foundation I would say
this is on like the medium coverage end
you can build it up but you're not gonna
get like full coverage with this guy the
lightest shade one see one is a bit dark
for me but this is another one that has
worked for dry skin and when I had oily
skin if you like a dewy look and you
like a little bit lighter coverage but
you have oily skin this might be a good
option for you you will have to set this
one for sure with the powder does feel
very moisturizing so when you first put
on you wouldn't think that it would work
with oily skin but it doesn't break down
throughout the day and it holds up
pretty well for having a finish like
this on oily skin but overall those are
all my top recommendations for
foundations for oily skin there were a
lot of other foundations that I loved
and that I used but I would just use
them in different ways like I would mix
them in with these foundations so if you
need good oil controlling foundations
try these out like I say in every
foundation video people's skin is
totally different foundation that looks
good on my skin it might look like total
 see is on your skin it just depends
you never know these are just what I
found worked great when I had oily skin
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you did don't forget to give it a thumbs
up I tell you guys to make up on the
rest of my face right now so for
eyeshadow I used the BH Cosmetics
festival palette I've been really into
this palette every shade of you so far
has been beautiful my eyelashes are the
kiss gala lashes for bronzer I used my
physician's form and the butter bronzer
in the shade bronzer two-faced Papa
don't peach is my blush shade this is
one my favorite blushes for highlight I
lift back out this guy haven't used this

of my favorite highlighters to the
hourglass ambient
strobe light palette I just used
a mix of all three shades and I also
have this light yellow one on my inner
corner of my eyes and in my lipsticks I
kind of layered to the base one is huda
beauty sugar mama and then the other one
