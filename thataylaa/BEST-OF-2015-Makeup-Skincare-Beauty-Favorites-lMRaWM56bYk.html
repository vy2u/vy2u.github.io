favorites I'm super far away from the
camera and the mic sounded really
staticky in the last video we'll figure
it out eventually so I've made a whole
box of stuff right here to show you guys
I went through all of my race and
rejects videos from the year and also
just thought about what I've been using
the most this year I didn't do like
categories and try and pick a product in
each category
I literally just picked my favorite
products from the year and we're gonna
talk about it who didn't breathe that
whole time when I'm told me this is
January 1st but this video probably
won't be up for a couple weeks yeah just
looking through my phone last night I
like looking through all the pictures
from the year this was a really good
year I just want to say thank you guys
for being a huge part of it hashtag
favoritos so getting into the products
let's start out with this my first
favourite of 2015 is the it cosmetics my
sculpted face palette this is my most
used contour palette you can see this
shade here I hit pan this is what I used
almost every single day to contour if
I'm not using this I'm using a bronzer
which I'll show you next how it is great
if you have pale skin if you have deeper
skin tone there's a darker shade right
here it's super versatile you can use
this shade right here for your eye
shadow like in your crease a lot of
times I'll use this for my eye shadow
when I'm going to work and I'm just in a
rush that'll blend real quick this
highlight shade is beautiful this
highlight shade is one of those products
where whenever I use it again I wonder
why I ever stopped using it because it
is so pretty it gives you the prettiest
light pink white glow to your face it is
beautiful like this is a totally
underrated product if you haven't picked
this up yet and you need a good contour
palette go for it every product that I
mentioned is going to be linked in the
description box you guys can check it
out so my favorite bronzer of 2015 is
the bodyshop honey bronzing 0-1 right of
this from Hawley it's lipstick if you
have pale skin you need this as a
bronzer even if you don't pale skin by
this in a different shade because the
formula of this is so nice for bronzer
it blends out effortlessly by the way if
you see like marks right here it's from
my cop pack at night they're not hickeys
we can all come down by far favorite
mascara
of life Too Faced better than sex
mascara I'm wearing it right now I don't
have falsies on there's something about
this bristle in this formula that just
separates your lashes so nicely it makes
them look really full and almost like
fluttery and wispy this is totally worth
the $24 to me or whatever it is I will
continue to repurchase this I have like
two backups right now and it is the best
this is definitely a favorite this year
this is the l'oreal infallible pro
makeup extender setting spray i used to
be a die-hard urban decay all nighter
this has totally replaced it it's about
half the price of urban decay setting
sprays i love the finish that gives my
skin it sets the powder into my face
really nicely I think I've gone through
probably like eight to ten bottles of
this this year if you're gonna try it
out wait till L'Oreal goes on sale
because the drugstore just rotates are
on their brands and you can get this at
like 40% off favorite foundation this is
a challenging to pick out out of
all makeup on planet Earth Foundation is
my favorite thing to play around with
and try out new products there are
definitely other foundations this year
that I love but just as much as the ones
I'm about to mention but that could be a
whole other review so these are
basically just standout products that I
found in 2015 that I think everyone
should try so the first one is the
Rimmel lasting finish 25 hour foundation
in 0-9 one light ivory I did a whole
separate review on this which I'll link
in the description box such an amazing
drugstore foundation the finish of this
is super similar to the Dior was that
cold thing was called superstar star
foundation star that sounds right
natural skin like finish it literally
looks like it melts into your skin you
can barely tell you're wearing
foundation but it has great coverage I
would wear this working out doing
jillian michaels this does not come
off I'm 99.9% sure that this foundation
really horribly breaks me out I still
wanted to include it because if you
don't have sensitive acne prone skin
this could be your new favorite
foundation it is amazing I still
sometimes wear it hoping that it doesn't
break me out I also have a full review
on this this is the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD foundation stick I feel like I
had to mention this in this
because I just feel like this foundation
deserves its own award I applaud the
Make Up For Ever labs for coming up with
this formula it is a stick foundation
but when you put it on it blends out so
effortlessly it has amazing coverage
definitely you can get this to full
coverage to shave this perfect for me
it's 1:15 I was just super impressed by
this foundation if you have oily skin
this isn't for you this definitely is
something that I need to set on my face
or else it does get pretty oily
throughout the day but for wearing for
short periods of time or if you're under
a camera or if you're going to be going
to an event or something like that this
is a beautiful foundation my last
foundation I wanted to mention is the a
cosmetics CC plus illumination cream
color foundation because it is a full
coverage cream doesn't break me out at
all when I wear this I feel like this
actually helps my acne this has SPF 50
in it which is a bonus I have this shade
fair and isn't quite light enough on its
own which is the only downside for me I
feel like I would wear this every single
day if it was half a shade to a shade
lighter I do have to mix this in with
something to be light enough for my skin
tone but this is basically like my go-to
mixer with products because it is full
coverage it has a beautiful finish it's
not the longest lasting on risk it does
have a really illuminating dewy finish
if you don't like illuminating products
they do make a normal non illuminating
version of this favorite concealer this
year hands down there's a long hair the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer I have
the shade fair neutral I feel like this
is going to be in so many people's 2015
favorites because this is the best
concealer I've ever tried this is all
you need full coverage creamy does
increase stays on all day
honestly the highlighter from here is
definitely a favorite of the year and
then my other one is the Mac mineralize
skinfinish my top is actually like
falling out classy I mention this
because this is one of those products
that I will never get sick of I'm
wearing it today as a highlight on my
cheekbone and it has the prettiest
subtle glow this is perfect if you're
going to work for you don't want a super
intense highlight this is in the shade
lightscapade which is perfect if you
have pale skin
it's that'll enough where it looks
natural but where you still look like
you have a really nice glow going on you
also layer that build up the product of
a few favorite lip products of the year
the first you could probably guess if
you've been watching my videos for a
while this is the Milani matte naked
matte color statement what were these
called matte naked
such a pretty lipstick shade I don't
think I've ever gotten more questions
about my lipstick shade in real life
then when I wear this lipstick there was
a phase this year where I wear this
lipstick every single day for about
three months to work perfect
Brown nude shade doesn't wear off weird
throughout the day where you have like
nothing on the inside of your lips and
give these out the drugstore for around
six dollars a nice Pro this is what I'm
wearing on my lips right now this is the
colour-pop liquid lipstick in the shade
mini debated putting this in here but
honestly it was one of the most worn
products of the year at the formula for
me I've such mixed feelings on these if
you want to know my full thoughts on the
colour-pop liquid lipsticks I have a
full review they're very very drying but
for being so reasonably priced and
having so many different good shades it
E is just the perfect nudey pink shade
if I'm not wearing the matte naked shade
to work it's this last favorite lip
product of the year is the la splash
smitten lip tint mousse waterproof this
isn't a shade inflamed this is my
favorite red shade of the year by far
when I want a long-lasting red lipstick
this is what I go for I'm kind of a
liquid lipstick hoarder I have a whole
half a drawer dedicated to liquid
lipsticks it's moisturizing it dries
down it doesn't wear off weird in the
middle of your lips if you're gonna try
it out make sure you get this smitten
lip tint mousse that took a while to say
it's their best formula in my opinion
and these are pretty affordable so it's
definitely one of my favorite skincare
products that I discovered this year
this is the Mario Badescu hyaluronic I
cream I mentioned this in race and
rejects video at the very beginning of
the year I still have been using almost
every single night there was a phase for
a couple months where I stopped using
this my concealers are decreasing under
there my under eyes started getting
super dry and I went back to using this
stuff and my under eyes feel great you
need the tiniest bit so this jar will
last you forever in cosmetics bye bye
pores pressed version I raved about this
a couple months ago this is in the shade
translucent it's just
loose and pressed setting powder that is
the best translucent press setting
powder you will ever try makes your face
look freakin flawless literally makes
your skin look like a doll's it has a
matte finish obviously but it doesn't
make your face look cakey at all it
looks like your skin is airbrushed it is
beautiful you're like I'm almost gonna
hit pan on this and I'm excited for that
day to come 2015 was the year of face
masks for me I only am including one in
this video because I am gonna be doing a
whole other favorite face mask video
this is the body shop tea tree face mask
this is my favorite I've gone through
two of these this is my third this is
great if you have acne prone or blemish
skin blemished skin I leave this on for
about an hour and I'll use this about
twice a week for thing love the smell
tea tree like I could sit here and smell
this all day smells so fresh and it has
this cooling effect when you put it on I
feel like it just gets all the crap out
of my skin okay we only have a few
credits left this is the Colgate optic
white toothpaste I actually like the
Express like three day Express I think
it's called version more but I haven't
been able to find it on my drugstore I
have to order like Amazon this is a bomb
whitening toothpaste I used to use the
crest 3d white this is so much better I
think I started using this because
Samantha Sherman uses it and she has
freaking white teeth when I first
started using this I totally noticed the
difference in the first week my teeth
looked whiter I feel like it really
helps to get off the stains on your
teeth if you're a coffee or a tea
drinker the favorite perfume was the
Burberry Brit perfume I got this a
little over a year ago and I started
using it because my first roommate when
I moved to Seattle wore this perfume and
it was one of those perfumes like people
would always stop and ask what it was it
has such a unique scent I've used about
half of the bottle so far I wear this to
work I wear this on the weekend I love
this it smells super mature to me but
not in like a grandma way last favorite
of 2015 is the Sally Hershberger glam
waves foam loose sexy curve style shaper
that is quite the name this is basically
a foam that you put in your hair when
it's damp you scrunch it up I braid my
hair at night and then when I wake up I
have normal non frizzy waves if you're
looking for
Perle product that isn't gonna make your
hair crunchy go with this stuff you can
get at the drugstore it smells so good I
love to smell this I wish they made this
in like a candle that was all of my
