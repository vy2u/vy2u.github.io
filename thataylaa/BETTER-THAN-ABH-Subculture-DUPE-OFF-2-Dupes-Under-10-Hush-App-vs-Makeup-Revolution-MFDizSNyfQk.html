all right so today we're gonna be doing
a little dupe off I'm actually testing
two dupes for the Anastasio subculture
pellet against each other one of my eyes
is one pallet one is the other right now
after I did the wish app make up a bunch
of you guys wanted me to try out hush
app makeup I had never been on there
never shopped on there and when I was
kind of looking around I came across the
bad habit retro love palette which looks
pretty dang close to the subculture
palette I didn't want to put the hush
one up against subculture because in my
opinion a piece of dog poop could beat
the subculture palette I feel like you
can only go up from here so instead I
wanted to see if I could find a second
dupe and put those dupes up against each
other
so that's what we're doing so this is
the makeup revolution reloaded iconic
division palette makeup revolution is
also known for doing a lot of dupes I'm
not gonna go full-on into my thoughts on
the subculture palette because I do have
a whole video on it I'll link that down
below if you happen to love the
subculture palette yeah you don't kill
me it's just an eyeshadow palette we can
all be friends and just keep using your
palette if you like it you don't have to
get these dupes so just some basic info
on both of these palettes the makeup
revolution one retails for seven dollars
this one retails for $10 you get
fourteen shades in this one which is the
same as the Anastacio and the makeup
revolution you get 15 shades so one more
shade and it is cheaper and both of
these products are cruelty free which is
really cool the subculture palette is
$42 so if we can find a dupe for that
let's do it so cast your votes down
below right now which I you think is
which palette so let's get into it if
you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the burrito family
and subscribe
Appling every Monday Wednesday Friday 6
p.m. sip time also I'm pretty sure this
is uploading on a Friday it's clearly
not foundation Friday today foundation
Fridays will be a little bit different
the next couple weeks because I am
currently balls deep in pre-recording
for 15 days of foundation I haven't
announced the dates yet but that will be
coming alright so we're gonna start off
with some swatches of both of these
palettes makeup revolution is on the top
the hush app palette is on the bottom
I'm not gonna try and analyze these too
much right now because I've already
filmed this so I know which one I like
better since there's 15 shades in the
makeup revolution and 14 in the hush
they did out of black there at the end
arm is clean there's no lotion or
anything on it and this is without a
base underneath all right so I have my
base makeup on right now I always do my
face before my eyes it is rare that I do
my eyes first I typically don't find
fallout to be that big of an issue if I
do have a little bit I'll just brush it
away with a big fluffy brush and it
usually comes right off this is a pretty
sticky base I use this every single day
when I do my eye shadow so that's what I
have on both of my eyes right now just
to give both these pallets a fair test
if you've never seen the Mac Paint Pot
it's basically just a cream shadow base
I've used this for oh my god probably 10
years now so we're gonna do one eye with
one one eye with the other which I
should we do I guess let's just do this
let's do the revolution on this side and
the what's it's called retro love on
this eye when I look at the colors in
these palettes I love them individually
and this is what happens with me with a
subculture - it takes me forever to
think about how I want to lay out the
colors on my eyes I never usually do
that I usually just kind of go in and
see what happens with the palette but I
feel like with these colors you do kind
of have to plan ahead there's some
complementary colors in here but then
there's other ones where I'm like I have
no idea what the heck I would pair that
with so I still don't know what I'm
doing I kind of want to go in with the
teals because when I did the subculture
video I did like a really bright yellow
mustardy kind of eye even though I'm
definitely most drawn to this shade
right here I'm gonna refrain we're still
gonna use it don't get me wrong I just
don't want it to be like my all over lip
color
we're gonna do some of the Till's maybe
with a little pop of that mustard I'm
gonna kind of wipe off my brushes in
between eyes just so there's not a whole
lot of transfer between the two all of
the brushes I use will be down below in
the description box along with
everything else on my face all right we
are zoomed folks tried to pluck my
eyebrows for you guys today because I
knew we're gonna be all up in here from
this palette there are no names so I'm
just gonna be pointing so we're gonna
start out with this shade right here
which is obviously like a light
transition shade it's called peace in
the rush or love if my eyes are hella
red and bloodshot right now it's because
I'm filming this at 7:30 a.m. it's
dipping my brush in here this one is a
lot more kind of dusty than the other
one has a lot more kick up it feels a
lot I don't want to say softer it just
feels like not as Griffey as I said and
I'm not getting as much pigmentation
either especially some morphe my beloved
is everyday this one I'm really having
to build up to get the same kind of
pigmentation this side is definitely
showing up better even though I've built
this up about three times now by the way
when I'm filming this I haven't done the
swatches yet so I don't know if there's
any difference in the shades or formulas
or anything like that yet no what the
heck am i doing okay I'm gonna take the
yellow mustard shade I just gotta do it
but I'm not gonna put it on the lid I'm
just gonna put some into the crease so
going in with the makeup revolution one
on this side that one looks a lot more
like a bright yellow to me showing up a
little bit more mustard on camera but in
real life it looks pretty yellow like
straight-up yellow but it's nice and
pigmented what is going on outside
there's like five thousand trucks that
is a pretty yellow has a nice pigment to
it yellow now going in with rebel on the
retro love side and I'm gonna wipe off
my brush rebel in the pan looks a little
bit less of a bright mustard yellow and
a little bit more of like a tan kind of
yellow so we'll see how this shows up on
the I doesn't seem to be blending out
quite as easily
I'm definitely preferring so far the way
that this one feels blending out and
just sticks I like that I like a little
bit of a firmer eye shadow that has like
a tiny bit of grip to it I just find
them most easy to work with on the
those yellow shades look pretty similar
I think it's time to go in with some
teal the teal in the makeup revolution
in the pan again haven't seen the
swatches yet in the pan it almost looks
like a cross between Maude and free love
to me in the retro love palette so let's
start out with the makeup revolution
teal shade ooh this looks buttery that
one looks like it has a little bit of
Fallout I kind of want to place it with
a brush and then use my finger to really
get the color payoff typically what I do
with lid shades because the difference
between using a brush for your lid shade
and your finger is huge like right now
this is looking not so great not very
impressive at all but now let's see how
it looks when I go in with the clean
finger there we go
it looks a bit patchy I'm gonna blend
out those edges and everything after but
I just wanted to get that color on there
so now I'm gonna wipe off my brush let's
go in with mod now interesting ooh this
one has quite a bit it'll fall out what
Wow well I mean if they're trying to
replicate subculture this is pretty
spot-on all right wow this is patch City
right I've placed it down I'm gonna use
my finger again it feels nice and
buttery and soft and again using your
finger makes a world of difference it's
still looking pretty weird and patchy in
certain spots though that I'm not really
able to cover up it just is clinging
weird
holy-shit sees this fallout is real the
shades look pretty similar this one
might be a touch darker barely
noticeable though this we're gonna have
to do some working with I'm gonna try
and get rid of some of us fallout this
might be a total disaster using a super
super flimsy brush like I usually use a
stippling brush like this to do this
because then the product doesn't like
attach to your face I'm gonna take this
orange Etan shade and then fab in the
retro love palette I'm gonna blend that
into the crease of it and kind of blend
out the edges of that blue creating
almost like an a light army green almost
which looks kind of cool all right let's
go in with fab I need to do some meat oh
man this is bad
I'm so confused by that blue now it's
just literally disappearing and also
what is going on up here so I definitely
need to go back in with mod on my finger
and I'm gonna try and get this back in
there guys a weird shade dude that shade
needs some work going back in with fab
since now that's like gun I don't know
if there's any fixing this one okay
change of plans going back in with the
shadow brush and let's go back in with
mod to try and get this blended out on
the edges somehow what in the actual
heck here's the makeup revolution side
versus this side right now it's
literally just falling all over the
place oh my god might be worse in
subculture might be worse I want to take
the purple shades in both Telus and use
that for the lower lash line this is the
makeup revolution one and then nostalgia
is the retro love both these look like
kind of a muted deep purple I think I
like nostalgia better on this one I take
a little blending brush and go into
lighter shades so rock and roll in the
retro love and this shade and the makeup
revolution I feel like that's a very
wearable purple it's not too obnoxiously
purple like if you have green eyes and
you just want to make them pop you can
just do your regular eye makeup and pop
some this on the lower lash line that
one seems to be totally fine I'm not
getting in time to fall out with that
one either I have an idea but this might
be a total disaster I'm going to test it
on my hand I mean
take I'm gonna take the same teal shade
that's on my lid right now and I want to
see what this copper would look like on
top of it could look like total
sees that might work I'm thinking if I
can do that it might kind of save this i
if i can put some of the copper right in
the center that shade looks pretty look
at that copper let's try the revolution
one
well this one's called revolution that
looks like a totally different shade you
let me do it with mod underneath look at
how mod just watched what the actual
heck something needs to happen with this
okay let's try and put the copper so I
already have the makeup revolution one
on my finger I'm gonna put that right on
the center just layering this up bunch
I'm gonna take revolution now from the
retro lobe oh there we go there we go I
think that is kind of helping the
situation maybe kind of my only options
for right here are the white chase which
is more of like a purple which actually
might look kind of good it's like a
duochrome definitely looks a bit
choppier and the retro love or I could
do the Light Lime whoo that one's pretty
scratchy in the makeup revolution the
retro love one looks much more pigmented
and was way softer and just put that on
the lower yeah maybe we'll do on the
center to this one I think I want to wet
yeah all right I just wet it with some
setting spray kind of pressing it in now
let's take a con oh yeah this one is so
freakin soft okay that shade is pretty
looks a bit more green than this one
this one has a little bit more of like a
goal to reflect to it
light gold now this one looks a little
weak sauce not my favorite look ever all
right so the makeup on the rest of my
face is done I put on some liquid
eyeliner and then also some black liner
on my waterline put on pure diva lashes
on my lips as bareMinerals
yes these are very sticky but they're
super pigmented like I didn't put any
lipstick or anything on underneath this
blush I used Mac Baroness blush my
highlight is oh this thing it's so
freakin pretty where did I put it
this new Mac real glow this is like
their first true highlighters I feel
like it's a 3 P on highlighting palette
I went in with this shade I've used this
a few times now and it
is beautiful you can kind of build it up
I was playing around with this the first
night you can get that like strobe
effect kind of look it is very intense
and then for kind of a bronzer I use
bare minerals Jen nude in beige for days
things that's definitely supposed to be
blush but just kind of used it to warm
up my face so now that the guys are done
I think it was a definitely good call to
go in with the copper shade because it
kind of made it so this blue isn't quite
as noticeable how shitty it is I think
if you were just looking at my eyes now
you probably wouldn't be able to tell
how crappy this one is but working with
this is pretty much a nightmare there
are a couple decent shades in here like
that
icon shade the light lime green one and
then also the revolution shade is pretty
overall just a consistency the way that
they blend out the pigmentation I would
definitely hands-down go with the makeup
revolution one and this one is cheaper
it's three bucks cheaper seven bucks for
this palette I think is worth it I mean
if you like the tones of the subculture
you just hated the formula or they don't
want to spend $42 on it then I mean I
would take this one over a subculture
any day if they put the green shade from
this palette into this one it would be
perfect
but out of the shades that I used hands
down easy when right here makeup
revolution definitely takes the cake
