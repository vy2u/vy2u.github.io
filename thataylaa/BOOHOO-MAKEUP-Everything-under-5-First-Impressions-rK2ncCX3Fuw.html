that just really tickled
all right so today we're gonna be
putting to the test boo whose own makeup
line I believe this is fairly new they
have a bunch of other products on there
but their actual online that has booboo
on it I think is new one of you guys
snatched me letting me know and as soon
as I saw that I went on there and bought
a bunch of makeup everything was half
off when I ordered never buy anything
full price on boohoo they always do half
off so each item that I got was under
four dollars and fifty cents which is
creepy
let's get going if you want to see my
thoughts on some butwho makeup and how I
got this look you're in the right place
just keep watching is that a gray hair
why am I seeing one two three what is
happening I feel like gray hair just
popped up overnight all right before I
have a quarter life crisis let's get
into this got my favorite fuzzy Costco
jacket on it's so cold in here that I
have my hot back on my lap I picked up
the boohoo Beauty Blender that's a
tongue twister duo you get a black
sponge in here and a pink sponge have
already dampened the pink sponge and I
don't think it changed size at all it
feels pretty hard so I don't have high
hopes for this but we're gonna try it I
also picked up this foundation brush the
Royal cosmetic connections actually
don't know why I picked this up because
I was gonna stick to all boohoo they
have basically the boohoo line and then
they have a bunch of other random makeup
on there since I did get this I guess
we'll include it in the video but
everything else is the actual boohoo
makeup line so when I ordered everything
was 50% off so I got the sponges for $3
the 2-pack and then the brush was $4
okay it feels very flimsy which I don't
usually like in foundation brushes
because you just don't get the best
coverage with it does feel pretty nice
and soft and there's a nice grip right
here to hold the brush and it has the
soft matte black it feels like those
really soft foam cases you know so I'm
gonna mix the derma Col 207 with Estee
Lauder Double Wear nude I have a whole
video on both of these actually I love
this Estee Lauder one it just doesn't
have quite enough coverage so I'm gonna
mix in some of the derma call and I just
poured out like half the bottle that's
great here we go yep
yeah this isn't that one sponge super
hard soaking up everything I'm gonna
switch the brush so the brush is nice
and soft on the face I'm just not
getting quite the coverage I like
because again this is flimsier so I'm
gonna mix some more and then switch to
the Sigma f80 on the other half of my
face just so we can see the difference
yeah that's crazy look at the difference
in coverage already
okay so finish up my base and brows
because the next beauty product we're
gonna try is their bronzer palette you
start shape tape concealer my laura
geller powder everything aged will be
down below in the description box my
lips are starting to get a little bit
dry from the accutane so the packaging
on these is pretty nice it feels really
nice and soft even have raised lettering
here the bronzer palette was four
dollars in the prices I'm telling you
guys are the 50% off prices because
again boo who always does 50% off so
don't buy these full price looks like
you get three shades in here to mattes
and one middle shade that looks like it
could actually be a really pretty eye
shadow or if you have a deeper skin tone
that middle shade could be a highlight
those feel really nice and soft I mean
this one is definitely lighter but I
feel like the tone of this is what I
prefer so I'm not actually going with
that darker one I thought wiping off
some of that foundation might make my
lips look less chapped but now it just
looks scary so I'm gonna take my wet and
wild angled brush I like to use to
contour I'm just gonna lightly tap this
cuz it looks like it has nice pigment to
it and I did set my face again with the
powder so product should blend would be
easy on top that has a really nice tone
to it I really like that shade actually
not too cool toned where it looks ashy
and I think it's actually not too dark
so I got this blush palette for three
dollars again it looks like the same
packaging but look at that shade that
looks like a really pretty baby pink
kind of shade with a little bit of more
cool tones in there it's pretty
pigmented definitely looks more
straight-up pink on the face it looks
like it almost has a little bit of a
sheen to it I was gonna take my powder
brush that I already put away and just
blend those together a bit I love the
box
color of this highlight palette I hope
the actual palette is pink yeah it's
hard to show up on camera because it's
pretty metallic but it's like this
really light pink shade so here's what
the shades look like looks like you have
a white in the middle a kind of darker
rosy pink and then almost like a
champagne color with a little bit of a
yellow tin Oh interesting I just did a
little finger swatch of that white one
and it's actually like a pink purple
looks pretty chalky swatched let's try
the other shades oh that darker pink one
actually swatches pretty light that
looks pretty look at that one ooh that
champagne one looks really nice too I'm
not that into the white highlighters
they actually have like a purple blue
reflex just not my thing but let's take
the champagne color I mean there's a
highlight for you it's definitely
intense and it looks nice but it is
emphasizing my texture a bit yeah you
can see like all the texture right there
if you don't have a lot of texture on
your face though you might like this
because it does have really nice pop to
it when I put it on my nose it seemed
yeah you can see my foundation like
rubbed off right there I'm very excited
to try this this is there's jet-set
vitamin-enriched makeup setting spray
this was $4 again it has nice pretty
sturdy packaging I dropped this and it
sounded like I was dropping glass but I
think it's just very thick hard plastic
first let's test this spritzer seems
like a fine mist okay
smells like chemicals but it has a nice
really fine mister on it this smells
like something nostalgic but like a
plastic toy not quite play-doh
definitely gave kind of a dewy finish
but I feel like it helped to kind of
settle all the powder products it looks
nice it has a nice finish to it if you
like dewy
when I prime my eyes using Mac Paint Pot
in soft ochre like always I got this
high pigment eyeshadow palette don't
really remember which one I picked out I
think there are a few different
eyeshadow palettes on there eye shadow
palette is 450 I say the highlighter the
highlighter was also 450 woah these are
freaking deep set like that I think I
want to do something with the purp
in here it says on the front that this
is high pigment okay that looks
promising so I'm gonna first go back in
with the bronzer palette and actually
take the warmer tone in here now I'm
gonna go in with the pink shade in this
palette right here in the corner I'm
gonna put that into the crease I think
ooh that's pretty
so there are two kind of purple shades
in here I'm first gonna take that dark
one and I'm just gonna take it on my
finger and then I'll probably use a
brush just to get it right where I want
it that's my finger it looks pretty
see-through and almost patchy so I'm
gonna go in with a brush see if that's
better I'm trying to wet it the brush
isn't really doing it either there we go
alright you definitely want to wet this
I'm gonna blend out those edges after I
just want to place down the purple first
there's something weird about the form
of this purple one now I'm gonna go in
with this deep shade right here that is
like going everywhere can you guys see
that I have a line of it down right here
what is happening all right well I'm
just gonna blend out the edges and then
go back in with that purple okay it did
it on this eye - it kind of just is like
jumping wherever the heck it wants
getting very patchy in random spots
well that just got weird I'm gonna go
back in with that first pink shade
because that seemed to do well she looks
pretty active shade right here let's try
it alright I want your wedding that it
just looks hella patchy at this point
okay change of plans let's try that
copper kind of bronze shade
and hope that it goes better than the
actual eyeshadows
there we go we're on sir pala is saving
the day that shade is really pretty as
eye shadow light pink shade in here
feels bit chalky I think I'm gonna go
back in with a highlight palette for the
inner corner let's try this shade the
pink one I think I like the highlight
and bronzer palettes better as eye
shadow than the actual eye shadow
palette okay I'm just using all three
shades at this point so for the lower
lash line I'm gonna go in with the shade
I use to contour I'm worried that since
the lips are gonna be brown eyes are
gonna be too warm looking so hopefully
this will help tie everything together
so I have this little duo of liquid
liner and pencil eyeliner we wouldn't
try out this liquid eyeliner this has
like one of the flimsy brush applicators
which is not gonna be fun for a wing I
think I'm gonna put this right at the
base and I might actually use this
pencil liner and like smudge it out nice
and black but I'm getting those like
staggered kind of lines this brush is
extremely flimsy I don't think you would
be able to make a wing or anything with
this yeah I mean it's hard to even get a
straight line with this so now I'm gonna
take that pencil liner and go over the
outer part of that line there's one
stroke so not the darkest kinda have to
go over it a few times the eyeliner is
kind of like doing this mud ring for me
because it just looks like gray and that
line was definitely dry so it's not that
it's just like removing the line I mean
that's working at smudging it wouldn't
use this as an eyeliner but going in
with a liner brush just kind of fade out
that edge I'm gonna be putting false
lashes on so I'm not super concerned
with the edge right here cuz the lashes
will cover it up I want to put those on
and I'll be right back I needed lashes
that are like look at my lashes not in
my eye shadow kind of lashes so I want
the who - Samantha number Seven's I like
these I don't think I've worn these
before so the last booboo product we're
gonna be trying is this liquid lipstick
kit kind of thing lip kit this is in the
shade nude they had a few different
shades I went with the lightest looking
Brown wick it was four dollars okay so
the tip of this is broken off I think
we're just gonna go straight in with the
liquid lipstick usually especially with
the matte liquid lipstick I just like to
go in with it
don't really line my lips oh it smells
like it smells like cherry well has it
really strong scent actually I like the
shade of this it looks like a nice kind
of milk chocolate nude whoa
that just really tickled okay so I
really like that shade that seemed to go
on nice and opaque not the most
moisturizing look the lipstick it feels
pretty drying but it's not to the point
where I wouldn't wear it again kind of
dry you can really smell this even after
it's on your lips time to take off the
jacket it's 20 degrees colder alright so
I think this is the final look that was
an interesting one so I'm gonna go
through really quickly and just give my
final kind of thoughts on everything
first impressions so the sponge
definitely know this is like a pink rock
brush I would pass on to you even for a
few bucks they're better brushes check
out my Amazon brush video the bronze
fella I think is really nice I would use
that again I like that contour shade a
lot I want to try out the bronze shade
on my face also that middle metallic
shade can obviously be used as
eyeshadows it kind of saved the day the
highlight palette is one of those that I
feel like some people would love if you
like that really intense pop and if you
don't have a lot of texture I want to
try it with the morphe M 510 brush
because sometimes when I have textured
ones the looser brush gives it a better
finish than the Sigma fo3 brush blush I
think works what I recommend you buying
it I don't know if you're already gonna
be ordering it stuff on there and you
want just a cheap blush maybe I don't
think is really anything special but it
blended out fine I'm just not like super
wide by it so these three face products
I think out of all of them the bronzer
one I like the best for sure this
eyeshadow palette I mean I think we all
know would not recommend this was kind
of a fail I really tried to make this
work the pink shade in here was nice
everything else was kind of pretty bad
patchy weird things happening there
definitely better affordable eyeshadows
out there setting spray ideas again I'm
gonna look more into the ingredients on
here cuz I'm not sure about some of
these but I like the way that it made my
skin look it looks really nice and glowy
and dewy so that's good everything
that's on my face and I tried out will
