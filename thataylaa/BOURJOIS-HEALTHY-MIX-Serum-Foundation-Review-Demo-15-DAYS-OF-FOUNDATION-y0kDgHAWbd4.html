all right so today it is day 9 of 15
days of foundation crazy if you're new
here this is where I'm trying out a new
foundation every single day for 15 days
days 1 through 8 our link down below in
a playlist along with last 15 is
foundation series if you missed that the
today's foundation is one of those
products I've been meaning to try for
literally years this is a very
well-known loved foundation especially
in Europe feel like it's not as popular
in the US just because you can't get it
in stores here you can get this online
there's a few different sites I'll link
them all down below but this is the
Bourjois healthy mix serum gel
foundation I believe they have a
different formula the healthy mix
foundation that's not a serum one I
tweeted you guys and asked what the like
popular one is to try out and the
majority of you guys said you wanted to
see this one so I went with this one so
it says one fluid ounce of product and
retails for between 15 and 17 US dollars
so this only comes in six shades and I
have the shade 51 vanilla player light
vanilla which is the lightest shade that
it comes in this one is a pretty dark
I'll show you in the demo part of this
video I made it work but if you're a
pale princess this one will definitely
be too dark it's really hard to tell the
shade ranch by these swatches but it
only comes in six shades which is a
little ridiculous I feel like especially
for a super popular foundation you think
they would want to expand the line to
cater to more people so I'm going to
read some of the claims on this online
it says it's a fresh and instant
blending gel texture blends and glides
on the skin for an even natural finish
with no mask effect as 16 hour radiance
booster and it's made from vitamin rich
fruit therapy it has lychee goji berries
and pomegranate I don't think I've ever
put fruit on my face so this is the
first so it doesn't say online what kind
of coverage it's supposed to be but on
the back of the bottle it does say that
it's light coverage it actually says
it's supposed to be a semi matte finish
you guys will see how it goes on that is
all the claims I'm going to serve some
swatches right now so you can see how
this foundation compares to some of the
other foundations that I own alright
swatch time so right here is the
bourgeois foundation in 51 next one over
is the derma call foundation and 2:08
Clinique continuous coverage and creamy
glow bourbon kay all nighter and 0.5
Kat Von D lock-it tattoo foundation and
l42
and the e X foundation in 1.0 the
lightest shade if you guys are enjoying
15 days of foundation don't forget to
give this video a thumbs up if you want
to see how the Bourjois healthy mix
serum foundation applies and wear
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching
alright so I think I may have officially
picked the worst two weeks to film for
15 years foundation hope you guys can't
hear that but they've been drilling up
there for an hour and I gotta film this
right now
okay so I have my Sigma f80 that we're
going to use on one side and then my
Real Techniques sponge on the other side
of my face and it looks pretty dark but
this is the lightest shade that it comes
in this is a very like dainty skinny
bottle so I've already washed moisturize
primed my face away anti blemish matte
primer so I'm going to start on this
side of my face with the brush and let's
just stipple the shade looks pretty
yellow not getting a whole lot of
coverage of all it smells really intense
what is it smell like and it smells like
the Dior sent a little bit floral very
light coverage off of that little layer
and it looks very dewy very glowy okay I
feel like I actually just got way better
coverage with a sponge I think I
definitely like the sponge side better
got a little bit better coverage and it
just looks a little bit more you can't
see any strokes or anything this I think
we died about highlight coverage on one
layer this one is light coverage for
sure I am going to go in for a second
layer to see if this is buildable it
definitely builds and doesn't look heavy
or anything I think we got it to about
medium coverage color is definitely too
dark it's really hard to tell on camera
but I think you can see right there
this is where I blended it and this is
my actual neck so the color is dark but
I think I can wear it today it'll be
okay if I was wearing this again I would
definitely have to mix in a foundation
Lightner or some of our foundation on
set to lighten it up oh yeah I'm looking
pretty dark so it looks really pretty on
the skin super dewy just looks kind of
healthy not a ton of coverage so
probably not one of the foundations you
want to go for if you have a lot to
cover up
you can still see stuff coming through
but it just kind of looks natural
alright so it is 904 when Paulo check-in
time at nine o'clock I'm gonna do the
rest of my makeup and I'll be right back
all right so it is now a 9:30 the rest
of my makeup is on set my face I use my
a cosmetic celebration foundation
illumination and fair you know this
foundation is dark when I put this
powder on and it actually helps to
lighten it a little bit this powder is
usually a tiny bit dark for me so the
fact that this lightened my face shows
how dark this is this is definitely a
foundation I think you would want to set
with a powder unless you have super
super dry skin it is a serum foundation
I just feel like it would have been
sliding around all over my face
throughout the day if I didn't set it
and with this powder on top it looks
really good I feel like this powder
added a little bit of coverage which I
feel like I needed it looks really good
on my forehead everywhere have a really
nice glow going on and it doesn't look
super powdery or anything blush bronzer
highlight blend it out fine on top other
than the shade I'm liking this so far I
think that looks really nice we'll see
how it holds up throughout the day on
the rest of my face for contour i use
the morphe 9 c palette i love this shade
right here the shade is perfection for
contour well I should I use a tiny bit
of the Ulta Sun glow blush I also have
this in my crease that's all that's on
my eyes right now this shade right here
from the elf illuminating palette is my
highlight mascaras to face rather than
sex and then my lips are two-faced lip
injection glossy in angel kisses I love
this but it burns hits one of those like
plumping things so we're calling the
check-in time 9 o'clock I will check
back in throughout the day alright so it
is now 3 o'clock I thought I was going
to be home by now so it's going to just
do the check-in at home but we are doing
it here because I'm still gonna be out
for a little bit so the foundation has
been on for 6 hours now and you guys it
looks good I really like how it looks
it's not really breaking down anywhere
I'm not getting creasing or anything on
my lip and this isn't car lighting and
car lighting usually looks super so
I feel like it looks pretty good even in
car lighting other than the fact that
it's super dark for me I would
definitely have to make something in
with this I might mix in like a drop of
Marc Jacobs remarkable in the lightest
shade next time I do this because I
would add a little bit of coverage and
it will
lighten it it's holding up really well I
think it looks really nice and just
natural and glowy six hours it's looking
good I will check back at the end of the
night right so it's now 803 so if
Foundation's been on for 11 hours I'm
kind of surprised how well this is held
up there at the days everything I
thought I was going to break down more
than it has but I feel like I'm only in
my normal spots but nothing extreme and
it's also held up well underneath if
that makes sense like product isn't
breaking up on my face it just looks a
little bit oily in my usual spots but it
has fully held up really well for being
on for 11 hours it hasn't preached
around my nose or upper lip at all it
really hasn't broken down anywhere on my
face it just looks a tad oily but
nothing major at all like that looks
pretty dang good the only thing is that
if you're pale looks going to be way too
dark not sure how deep the dark shades
go but it doesn't look like goes that
deep so shade range is a major thumbs
down for me but everything else I
actually really enjoyed so I think this
one is worth a go if they have a shade
that will match you if you like dewy
light to medium coverage foundations you
might really like this one I like this
one I'm excited to keep using this so if
you guys liked this video and you're
excited for the rest of 50 News
foundation make sure you give this a
thumbs up
