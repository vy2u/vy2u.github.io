black to silver journey documentation
videos so about a month ago I put up a
video black to silver transformation
part one that was basically documenting
going from box black dye of 10 years to
about a brown shade I'm not at my end
goal yet this is just the next step in
the journey I've actually gone to the
salon three times in between that last
video three times one two three yep and
what you're seeing today I'm pretty sure
I have about one more step one or two
more between pure silver I've been
documenting pretty much this entire
process on snapchat so if you've missed
that my snapchat is the tale of snaps I
pretty much shared a bunch of the
products I've been using the salon
experiences so just have to make the
disclaimer every time in hair videos
that I am NOT a professional hair
stylist I didn't go to cosmetology
school I am just me my thing is makeup
not hair this is just what I've
experienced I overall I just feel like
I've learned a ton between that last
video and now so there's a bunch of
stuff that I want to share with you guys
can just kind of give my thoughts and
advice if you're also thinking of going
from like brown or black to blonde or
silver because there's just a lot of
stuff that I feel like it's hard to find
kind of all in one video the products
I've been using how to repair damaged
hair my hair was severely damaged which
I didn't realize in that last video the
severity of it so I'm just going to go
through that and let's get into it
so I highly recommend starting with that
video I'm not going to go into
everything that I touched on in that
video so start with part one if you're
just landing here go watch that video I
explain a lot of the stuff that I'm
going to skip out on in this video so
basically after that video after reading
all of your guys's comments and then
doing a bunch of research and stuff I
didn't realize because the salon never
told me how severely damaged that back
section of my hair was basically it was
gummy it was sticky and it wasn't just
like a thing where it was like that for
a couple weeks
it definitely has gotten better over the
last two months but once my hair growl
in the back it was something where I
eventually had to just cut it out now I
did a ton of research on gummy hay
and products to use pretty much
purchased all those products tried a ton
of different stuff and I am like 90%
sure that my hair was just totally dead
olaplex number three couldn't repair it
that was pretty disappointing because
that was just going from black to that
brown color that really shouldn't have
happened in a professional setting I'm
pretty chill about stuff like that and I
wanted them to be able to fix it so I
went back a second time to that salon
and I had a different girl and she is
amazing her name is Mika so basically
what had happened is the back of my hair
was a lot lighter than the front and the
back was also extremely damaged so she
ended up doing full foils on the rest of
my hair we basically left that part
totally alone and just kind of like
evened everything out so that the rest
of my hair was as light as that damaged
section in the back I'm gonna insert a
picture right here that I posted on
Instagram which was after going to Mika
she did a really good job it looked
really good for what she was working
with I was really happy when I left the
salon the second time so basically after
that second visit I was in full repair
mode so I was trying everything to fix
my hair I was using old Plex I was only
washing my hair like once or twice a
week I was doing a ton of hair masks I'm
gonna share with you my favorite ones
that I found after I finished where we
are right now that first one was in
Bremerton I live in Seattle so it's
about an hour ferry ride each way so it
is a commute and I super randomly ended
up finding this stylist named Vee on
Instagram and she specializes in color
correction and all of her photos were
pretty much super warm super orange hair
transformed into like gray silvers
actually blonds and that is exactly what
I'm going for
I just texted her and she randomly had
an opening that week according to
Instagram I first started this process
on May 28th second process was on June
21st so I waited a month between the
first and the second again we didn't
touch the damaged area then from there I
waited three weeks I went in on July 6th
to go into V who's at Salon Bella in
Bellevue if you're from the Seattle area
so I'm going to post the before and
after picture here but she is honestly
so extremely talented one of the things
I wanted to mention
in this video and no shade to any of the
stylists that have worked on my hair I
don't want to mention the first person's
name because she has done amazing work
before I've seen her pictures I've seen
her Instagram and I just think mistakes
happen I don't know her history I don't
know how long she's been doing hair but
just with anything you learn from your
mistakes part of that that I learned
throughout this whole process is that
going from black to blonde or black to
silver is a really hard thing and if you
don't find someone that specializes in
color correction or has done black to
blonde before and I was researching
people to go to for this I had about
five stylist on Instagram tell me
straight up no like they weren't willing
to touch my hair because they knew there
would be a ton of breakage there would
be a ton of damage so I think part of
the key to all this is really finding a
stylist that you trust make sure that
you do intense research on them and just
previous photos ask if they use old Plex
ask if they've done blocked blonde
before it's not an easy thing which I
realize now and I'm just so thankful
that I found Vee because this is what
she specializes in find someone who is
so extremely talented because you're
going to be paying out the butt for this
and if you are it better be worth it and
they better not kill your hair so after
that first time that I went to V that
toner actually faded really quickly so I
had this kind of gray look going on to
actually fade it in about three washes
so it totally came out of my hair my
hair pulls super super warm I have
naturally strawberry blonde hair I'm
basically gonna have to be doing a ton
of upkeep when I actually get silver I
can tell to keep those warm brassy tones
out after two weeks it was to this color
which again it didn't look bad at all
it's just I like super ashy so then this
last point which will be my fourth
appointment total which was yesterday
the hair I have right now I went to be
yesterday and she just killed it I
really like the cut pretty much all the
dead section is off in the back it's
pretty short in the back but I don't
mind it now if you follow me on snapchat
you know that I've been getting super
frustrated about just not being silver
like I said in the first video when I
have an idea in my head I just like want
it to happen and I have to do it so this
whole process it's been pretty much two
months two and a half months so
and I know a lot of people have to go
like four months or eight months
depending on your hair my hair actually
bounces back pretty fast now my hair
isn't healthy right now but it
definitely isn't fried it's just dry and
needs some love but for me I'd rather
have that kind of condition and be the
color I want because if not I'll just
like diet blue or diet black or
something and then all this would be for
nothing when I was that super warm shade
a few weeks ago I was so close to dying
my hair blue I was so close to just
getting bleach and doing it but I held
out and I'm so glad I did because I feel
like I am on the final straw now I have
one or two sessions before I'm
completely silver I'm gonna talk about
how I plan on keeping it this kind of
actually color between now and my next
one because what I think I want to do is
wait about six weeks this time so that
my hair is really healthy and so that we
can really hopefully push it to get it
to silver so I don't have to go in a
second time so few people in snapchat
asked how much this whole process has
cost so far my first two sessions were
about 175 each which I felt was really
cheap actually because most people
charge per hour and I was there for like
five hours but it was only 175 each time
v charges for color correction per hour
so it is a little bit more pricey the
first time I was there for like seven
hours I was literally there all day I
think it was like five something then
the second time which is this hair it
was 350 and I was there for five hours
so just keep in mind that this is not a
cheap process for me it's something that
I really want I really want silver hair
and pretty much in my whole life
I have never paid for salons like I just
dyed my hair myself so I just kind of
think of it as like this is what I would
have been paying for all these years if
I was going to a salon I'm gonna kind of
see what my hair looks like when it's
silver but I have a feeling that I will
be able to find a way to do like the
upkeep in between myself and then go to
a professional every like three months
hopefully so I'm going to talk a little
bit about the products that I used and
that I am
I'm going to be using so when I had the
orange super warm hair you want to use a
blue shampoo a lot of people will tell
you purple shampoo on the color wheel
purple is the opposite of yellow blue is
the opposite of orange so if your hair
is more orange than it is light blonde
you're going to need to use a blue
shampoo I have the joy coat color
balance blue which did a little bit for
me on the parts that were light enough
my hair with so many different shades of
Bratz that certain parts of this took to
the shampoo other parts I feel like it
did nothing too so you're just gonna
have to determine for yourself if your
hair is light enough to use blue shampoo
or purple shampoo but this can help is
basically like a super blue shampoo it
kind of like dyes your hands blue it's
that blue if want more intense color you
can put on dry hair and then wash it out
I kind of did a comp of the two so based
on your guys's recommendations in last
video for the dead section on my hair
i've been using the anza healing color
care this is the trauma treatment this
stuff is great you need the tiniest bit
of this I really think this made a
difference oh the gummy section in my
hair it basically would like instantly
dread and be this like dry straw thing
as soon as it died basically felt like a
giant dreadlock so I do think that this
helped to take out the gumminess and to
bring the rest of my hair to an okay
place this is pretty pricey but you can
get on Amazon for like $10 cheaper I
think then you can on Ulta so that's
what I did put this in wet hair after
you shower if you have damaged hair you
want to apply as little heat as possible
and also only wash your hair like once
or twice a week wash your hair as little
as possible because every time you wash
your hair it takes out the natural oil
so this is something that I think only
like 2 or 3 of you guys snapped me but I
decided to randomly pick it up and I'm
so happy that I did because I honestly
feel like this has worked better than
probably 15 of the high-end products
that I picked up this is the L'Oreal
total repair damage erasing balm you can
get this at the drugstore I'm sure some
of your hairstylist will have something
to say about this but honestly this has
done wonders on my hair I've used it
about four times and I noticed the
difference after the first time my hair
just felt so much softer so much more
moisturized to use this just in the
shower as a conditioner where I just
leave it on for about five
it's highly recommend this if you have
dry damaged hair I know a bunch of you
guys are going to comment telling me to
use olaplex
and I can't remember if I mentioned that
in the last video but yes I've been
using old Plex throughout this whole
process every salon I've gone to has
been using olaplex I do have the number
three at home treatment which you can
actually get on Amazon that isn't going
to make your hair feel soft it's just
supposed to be rebonding the molecules
so it's supposed to make your hair
stronger and repair it but you're not
going to like feel that much of a
difference so what I usually do is use
the olaplex number three treatment leave
it on for a few hours then go in shower
and use that mask from L'Oreal and that
combo is amazeballs so the last thing
that I feel like has really helped my
hair is coconut oil this is a huge-ass
thing of coconut oil I got this off of
Amazon it's unrefined pure cold-pressed
organic coconut oil this is the best
value that I found like dollars per
ounce I'm gonna link all the products
I'm talking about down below but you can
just pick this up it's great leave it on
overnight or just leave it on for a few
hours can't go wrong with coconut oil
this just adds moisture back into your
hair so now that my hair is this color
what I'm going to be using is purple
shampoo I do think my hair is light
enough for purple to take to it now it's
definitely a shear and I know that this
Ash is going to wash out in a couple
washes so what I plan on doing is using
the Pravana
perfect blonde purple toning shampoo
depending on how much this helps to tone
my hair if it doesn't work you'd find
something in the meantime that helps to
keep me ashy and from what I've heard
from you guys looks like there are two
ways that you can go about doing that
the first one is by using a toner which
can be a lot more damaging because it
does have peroxide in it but the ones
that I've been looking into our Wella
t14 and well at-15 now t18 is like the
cult favorite but from what I read I
really think for my hair and like the
look I'm going for
t-50 will probably be more like a gray
and then t14 is really for silver and
stuff so I'll probably try g14 first see
if my hair is light enough for that one
and if it's not going with t-50 I might
mix it too let me know what you think
the other option is skipping out on the
toe
are all together in trying a
semi-permanent dye now the downside with
that is that I believe you have to use
like a clarifying shampoo or something
to actually kind of remove that before
you go in for your next bleach but the
ones I've really been looking into our
joy coat titanium and then also I on
titanium I've also heard that you can
use Manic Panic ultraviolet she's a tiny
bit of that exiting with a conditioner
or something and just let that sit on
your hair for a little bit so I'd love
to hear what you guys think about that
especially if you're a hair stylist so
hopefully the next hair journey
transformation video I make will be when
I'm completely silver if you kind of
want to get tape and extensions too
unfortunately Vee doesn't do tape and
extension so I'm going to have to find
someone else who can do like silver tape
ins if you have any recommendations for
people that do tape ins in the Seattle
area let me know down below I hope that
this video was helpful for you guys and
that you got some ideas for products
that you want to try at their hair and
just if you're going from black to
lighter I hope that this series is
helpful for you guys if you want to see
a look on the makeup I'm wearing in this
video it'll be up after this video
probably in next week or the week after
love you guys thanks for watching see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
