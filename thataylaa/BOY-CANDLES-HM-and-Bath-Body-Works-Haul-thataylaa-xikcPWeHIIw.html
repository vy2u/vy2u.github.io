but he's definitely single I have
exactly 14 minutes before I have to
leave my house for work so well let's
power through this hall still drinking
my coffee it stick on it's that kind of
morning this Hall is kind of a I don't
know I ordered way too much stuff on
Cyber Monday so I'm kind of like
breaking up the hall so it's not like a
half hour hall where clothes jewelry
candles
what would a hall be without Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works candles right so let's just get
started but first two things I got our
jewelry this is from Target it is this
like chain necklace and it has some
rhinestones in there um I don't know I
feel it really very badass when I put
this on and it was like 16 bucks 15
bucks which is kind of pricey I don't
know what is going on with Target lately
they are not cheap anymore target has a
ton of cute jewelry right now and
statement necklaces and that kind of
thing so if you're into that go check
your house piece of jewelry I got is
this super chunky obnoxious statement
necklace that I'm absolutely in love
with and it is from eBay I think it's
like six dollars I'll put the seller in
the downbar another accessory I picked
up is this black gold and rhinestone
kind of headband thing and this is
actually from Payless it was $7.99 but I
think it was like 30% off or something
and they were doing some kind of Kahless
sale looks really cute when you have
your hair in like a high messy bun
literally all the clothes and everything
I'm showing you right now is like black
gold and silver just to warn you so all
the clothes I'm gonna be showing you are
from H&amp;amp;M apparently they were having is
absolutely insane sale and may still be
going on I don't know my mom just called
me and was like you have a box of black
clothes coming and all of this stuff is
like three five and ten dollars one of
them is 15 just in same deals though so
all this stuff my mom sent me in a box
and when she told me that everything was
like three and five dollars I was like
great I'm gonna have like 5000 black
cotton t-shirts but all this stuff is so
freaking cute I doubt to mama the neck
oh just said my last name
shoutout to my mom for the next few
things because holy balls I'm obsessed
with all of them and all this is pretty
much for work I don't wear black like
every day well actually I kind of do
wear black every day whatever so these
black polka dot tights the first thing I
think they were like 995 I took off the
tag because I thought I was wearing them
today but I'm not saying is this like
black crocheted high-neck kind of top
and can we just look at the price tag
people how insane is that this will be
cute for like the summer time too I
don't know why I think of summer when I
see this like crocheted thing like it
this one I'm obsessed with it is this
mesh long-sleeve black top and it has
mesh in the middle as well I'm not sure
what I'm gonna wear with this on the
bottom because I don't want to wear like
pants because then you got the whole
love-handle action going on I might try
and find like a black skater skirt kind
of thing I really want leather skater
skirt from American Apparel this was
five dollars what the the next
thing is this high-waisted skirt which
needs to be what's up called lip rolled
as leather piping down it if that's what
you would call it it's high waisted it's
adorable
and this was ten dollars normally 1795
next dress is this black lace tight
dress it also has a lace going down the
sides which is really cute and I like it
because it is like a high neckline I
really like high now I don't know why
but like I feel like as I'm getting
older I don't have any desire to like
show the girls if you know what I mean
but I really like this one this one
wasn't on sale but it's normally 995
can't be that my absolute favorite thing
that my mom I got me this black polka
dot mesh dress can we just take a look
at how freaking cute this is it was $15
normally 2495 it looks so cute on I like
how it's loose on the bottom I'll
probably wear this with like mesh tights
and the boots that I'm going to show you
next wanted to get kind of like high
heeled boots that I could wear to work
that I wasn't gonna absolutely die in
and it is so hard finding shoes in my
size because I have midget feet I don't
want to talk about it I have to
Noora or like by ship from japan online
because my feet are that small but ross
had these guys and they actually fit
with only one pair of socks normally
have to layer like three pair of socks
to fit into ship normal people shoes but
look how cute these are they're suede
they have like a I don't know probably
two and a half inch heel two inch heel
but they're really comfortable because
they have that like thick base so
they're walkable these were $27.99 from
Ross so like I said what is a haul
without spending ridiculous amounts of
money in bath and Bodyworks the bath and
Bodyworks was having their $1 three wick
candle sale obviously I had to go in
they were pretty picked through but all
of my favorite ones were still there no
I don't like all the like holiday scents
really I had like very specific even
though I have a stack of them in my
closet naturally I was like I have to go
buy some more so I got more candle my
total was 32 and then I had the $10 off
30 coupons so I ended up spending 22
dollars on four candles which is insane
they're normally 20 each oh my god is
another mahogany teak wood I am obsessed
with this candle it's my absolute
favorite it smells like Abercrombie Man
and I love it and I will be repurchasing
it for the rest of my life the next one
I got is vanilla cedar wood and all of
the candles I like smell like some form
of boy I don't know why I go for those
candles you can rosette describe this as
a hipster boy and it is totally a
hipster boy candle but like a little bit
preppy maybe the kind of boy that like
grows up in upstate New York and then
moves to Brooklyn that's this candle
next one I got is black tie another boy
candle I didn't know that these were a
limited edition or would have stocked up
look at how freaking cute the top of
these are in the packaging this is more
of like a 30 year old man but he's
definitely single and he has like a very
good job but he's still not quite sure
what he wants to do with his life he's
not completely satisfied in his job you
know past Battenberg
house bath and Bodyworks candle is
called party dress one smells like a
straight-up girl perfume like maybe
something you would wear from Victoria's
Secret in like eighth grade but
nonetheless I like it if you like any of
the like perfume Cologne
definitely go and smell the ones I
picked out because I'm all about the
perfume Cologne sense if you couldn't
tell the last kind of item in this hall
I have so much other stuff I have to
haul but we're gonna split it up the
last item I got is from eBay and it is
this brush set I believe it's 30 brushes
I'll put all the info below but I wanted
to get some more brushes for my
freelance kit so I don't have to use my
like personal brushes and I kind of want
to use my personal brushes for my
freelance stuff and then keep these for
me because they're that amazing I am
like in shock so I have a couple already
out which I have been using it's just an
assortment of brushes literally and any
kind of brush that I could ask for
pretty much except a flat top kabuki
came in this set I'm not quite sure how
many came in here maybe it was 15
brushes and it was $30 they're so soft
like absolutely so soft so if you're in
the market for new brushes and don't
want to spend whoa a ton of money on
Sigma or Sedona lace or one of those
then definitely try out these brushes I
don't think you'll be disappointed but
time is it how are we doing five minutes
early so that was everything that I'm
gonna be showing in this hole okay like
I was saying that was everything for the
haul thumbs up this video if you like
haul oh my god I'm gonna kill my phone
thumbs up this video if you like hauls
and if you want to see the rest of the
stuff I got comment down below with what
your favorite Bath &amp;amp; Body Works candles
are coz I want to know thanks for
