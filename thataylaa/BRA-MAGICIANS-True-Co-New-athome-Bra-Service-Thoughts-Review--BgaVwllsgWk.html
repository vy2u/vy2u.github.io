to get good lipstick this is a joke I
feel like the lipstick gods are playing
a cruel cruel joke on me right now
sometimes you just have to feel like
Nicki Minaj okay this is such a fail so
I just had a very unique getting ready
experience it was like I never put
lipstick on my lips before and then the
hoops happened is channeling my inner
Nicki Minaj right now that's what's
happening can I just tell you guys how I
feel right now I feel like this video is
gonna get real weird I feel like that's
always what happens when I film at night
you know so the reason why I'm making
this video and sitting down and filming
right now is to tell you guys about I
don't say box service because I don't
think of it it's not a subscription
service but this company that I found on
my own I didn't reach out to me or
anything like that I paid for these on
my own this is just something that I
think is really cool and I want to share
with you guys I came across this website
after doing some research for marketing
project it was actually like the same
exact idea that we were trying to come
up with for this project so when I found
a website that was actually already
available I was like hell yes I'm buying
this
they're called true and Co were all
girls we all have boobs and we're gonna
talk about him so if you are a girl or a
teenager or women then you know that the
bra search struggle Israel not only is
it difficult to find a bra that actually
fits your boobs correctly but it's an
annoying and kind of uncomfortable
experience for a lot of people the cool
thing about true and co and what makes
it different is that kind of like an
at-home personalized experience so
basically how the whole thing works is
you go into true and code there's this
quiz it's very descriptive like if you
can fit three fingers in between your
boobs let's just do it together let's
have a collective boob feel your bottom
heavy or your top heavy there's all
kinds of different questions which like
I learned so much about myself I did not
know much about my boobs but now I do
and it feels great so you take this quiz
and then it creates your shop which
Stickley has like their recommendations
for bras that will fit you best based on
their like bra experts and reviews and
things like that and at first I was like
kind of skeptical because either way
when you're buying a bra online you know
you don't know how it's going to fit
it's a skeptical experience what your
own code does to eliminate that is you
put your credit card down they send you
five bras at no cost free shipping I
believe three of those are your pick and
then two of them are like expert pick so
they'll throw on random ones that they
think might be good for your girls so
once you actually receive the bras you
have five days to go online and tell
them which ones you're keeping they
print you out a free return shipping
label so you don't pay anything until
you find a broad that you like and that
was something that was really cool to me
so say I got my box and I didn't like
any of the five bras I literally just
print out the free shipping return label
put them back in the mail no hassle
everything's fine the world will go on
so when you get your box in the mail it
looks like this it just says true on it
open it up and they have all of the bras
which obviously men are not in here they
have all the bras in this tissue paper
and they're all wrapped in plastic nice
and new when you get your box they give
you this card right here it talks about
what to do when you're at home trial
starts so it gives you literally like
step-by-step instructions and also if
you share on Twitter or tweet a picture
of you get a free panty so that's great
I will insert a picture right here of
all the broad choices I got they are
already packaged in the return thing so
I can't show you but I am showing you
the one I'm keeping let me just tell you
we're gonna get real personal right now
my left boob is a whole size bigger than
my right boob which apparently is very
common but I rarely find a bra that fits
either one of my boobs when I got these
bras I was like okay this is gonna be
fun we're gonna try them on we're gonna
send them all back whatever I don't know
if it's a good thing or a bad thing
because now I want all of them every
single bra except one fit me perfectly
 bra magicians let me tell you
bra shopping is usually such a
frustrating experience for me and I'm
like blown away that four out of five
bra's I could have kept this is the
broad that I ended up keeping love the
color it fits me perfectly like I've
never had a bra that fits me so well
it's so comfortable
I'll have the style info and everything
down below if this is the one that you
decide to choose so what I'm doing is
since this fits me so amazingly this
bras like in my face right now whoa
matches my lipstick oh because this bra
fits me so perfectly and it's so magical
in so many ways I decided to return the
other four and then I ordered this one
in two more colors because life of a
shopping online addict so after you pick
the bras that you like they make it
super easy they give you a return
packing thing I have my four bras in
here right now so once you have them
packaged in there use super easy to just
go on their website select the ones that
you don't want at that point they charge
you for the bra or bras that you decided
to keep you can keep all five if you
wanted to I should say that they range
about forty to sixty five dollars which
is pretty typical for a good quality bra
that's pretty similar to Victoria's
Secret this one I believe was 42 I want
to say which I'm willing to pay for if
it's a bra that is high-quality and
actually makes the girls feel good and
look good I do have a coupon code down
below for $30 off your purchase I
believe which is pretty amazing if you
want to try these out which I highly
recommend you should because I have
nothing bad to say so that is kind of
how the bra service works I do want to
talk about the customer service for a
second because that is something that is
really important to me in a company I
did have some issues with my order one
thing led to another I shifted to the
wrong address on accident freaking out
because you only have five days to
return it I contacted the lady right
away at customer service she emailed me
back within like 15 minutes was super
friendly changed the order for me and
then about three weeks had gone by and I
was thinking wow that's this is taking a
while email saying one of my bras was
out of stock so I thought maybe that's
what was holding up the order so I
emailed her super-nice got back to me
right away again apologized and said
that she would send out the bras first
thing tomorrow morning like today
Express delivery I got it
next day that was really cool of her I
really appreciated the fact that they
have great customer service and that she
was very responsive I was initially
going to just make a blog post on this
but then I heard that this is something
that I've never seen someone talk about
before on YouTube I think it's a genius
idea and I had literally zero complaints
if you want a bra that actually fits
your girl's ear in the right place what
reasons why you don't clip a light on
this sleeping lamp I think we're good I
knew this was going to be a weird-ass
