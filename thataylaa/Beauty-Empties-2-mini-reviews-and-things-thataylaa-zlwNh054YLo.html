apartment when you can film YouTube
videos instead welcome to my life so
today I have my second empties video
ever I really like empties videos
because I can tell you guys what they're
not I'm going to repurchase something
and it's probably stuff that I haven't
mentioned in other videos before or I
have and I'm just repeating myself but
we'll see so today I'm showing you my
trash which is displayed in this
Victoria's Secret bag for your viewing
pleasure got a refill on the coffee I'm
ready for the world so let's just jump
right in not going in any order just
gonna pull out so the first thing
is the Proactiv skin smoothing
exfoliator have gone back on Proactiv
because I've been having some pretty
intense breakouts on my chin you can't
see because I'm wearing full coverage
foundation which I have a whole shadow
and shmooze get ready with me video on
this look which I will link over here
actually I don't know which one's gonna
be up first if this one comes afterwards
I'll link it over there anyways this is
just the exfoliator by Proactiv not much
to say about this it's just part of
their line which works really well on my
skin so part of the Proactiv plus so
it's not the original Proactiv it's like
that new line that they came out with
which works a lot better on my skin than
the original Proactiv so it's just the
exfoliator just gonna throw these in the
trash
feels so good next I have the Urban
Decay all nighter makeup setting spray I
will continue to repurchase this for the
rest of my life these are just makeup
setting sprays if you do not use a
makeup setting spray of what the
are you doing you definitely need these
in your life next I have two of the
Neutrogena makeup wipes these are my
go-to makeup wipes I don't like using
anything else this is what I use for my
eye makeup face makeup everything it
takes it all off next I have this Target
brand up and up Body Wash this is the
oatmeal and shea butter this was
horrible I poured the last like fourth
of it into the hand soap thing because I
just wanted to be done
that it doesn't lather at all so you
have to use like three times as much as
you usually do definitely will not be
repurchasing the up and up brand body
wash right now I'm using the axe one
which I mentioned in a haul video and I
love it it smells like heaven and man
and vanilla combined next I have the
Physicians Formula eye booster pen I use
this like a month longer than I should
have it like doesn't even come out black
anymore this is my favorite drugstore
liquid eyeliner I've ever used if you're
looking for an affordable eyeliner I
would definitely recommend this it's
what I'm wearing on my eyes right now I
love the packaging I love the way the
brush feels I have zero complaints about
this thing next I have the Neutrogena
deep clean invigorating foaming scrub
has a tingly lather which I really like
I love like the menthol feel on your
face just feels like it's working you
know I'm all about that next I have to
do Durance one of them I like and one of
them I hate the first one that I really
like is from Dollar Tree actually and
it's the lady speed stick this works the
best on me this stuff doesn't do I
always try new deodorants and then I end
up going back to this one I tried the
old spice one which I really liked but
it gave me a hardcore rash under my arm
I'm pretty sure it like burned my skin
anyways yeah I really like this
deodorant moving on I have a few ooh
what is that I have a few makeup
products the first one is the Revlon
Colorstay in 110 ivory this is my holy
grail drugstore foundation I will
continue to be repurchasing this for as
long as I'm alive if your skin tone is
close to mine then this is a perfect
match a little bit even on the light
side but I warm it up with blush and
stuff so it doesn't matter stays all day
doesn't look cakey gives amazing
coverage I love this stuff another Holy
Grail product is my Physicians Formula a
translucent correcting powder I don't
use this as a correcting powder I use it
to set my under eye concealer slowly
because it is actually light enough to
do that so if you have fair skin try
this for sending your under eye
concealer but I use it as an all-over
face powder my mom likes to call me a
Geisha that's lovely
next is this Milani easy brow pencil in
dark brown I really liked this pencil I
haven't used a pencil on my eyebrows for
a while but I've been keeping this for
whoa
for the spoolie thing because why isn't
that showing up there we go I'm keeping
up for the spool you just to comb out my
brows but it's getting a pretty ratchet
looking so I was like okay it's time is
those thing out but I do like the Milani
pencil if I see this I will probably be
repurchasing it but I don't know I just
got anastasia dipbrow her anastasia or
whatever the scold I just got the
dip brow pomade and I really really like
that so last I have these tug Abboud's
Rite Aid green tea and cucumber baby
wipes I keep using my makeup drawer and
I just use it to wipe the foundation off
the back of my hand my hand is like my
mixing station so I definitely need baby
wipes in my drawer so I just like to
keep them to wipe off my makeup station
and keep things clean so that was
everything that used up since my last
empties video which I will link at the
end of this video if you want to see
that let me know down below if you guys
enjoy these videos and if you do be sure
to give it a thumbs up so I know I have
a few things right now that I'm like
almost out of so I'll probably have
another empties video coming in a few
weeks so if you like them like I said if
you want to see this look check the down
bar and you can watch a tutorial get
ready with me shadow to true this video
