boxing and ha minute so I got the candy
Johnson beautycon box in the mail
actually guys on snapchat if you wanted
to see an unboxing so here we are today
we just talk about this box I love this
black and white print I own like way too
many teachers with this print so before
we open this guy up I did just film a
one brand tutorial using all elf
products on look I'm wearing right now
pretty sure that will be up before this
so I'm going to link that down below the
description box I like don't want to cut
into this it looks so pretty got the
gold scissors feel like these don't even
qualify it scissors it's like a straight
up nice feature so sure okay I am super
excited about this because I say this
I've never had a beautycon box before oh
I think I just cut the wrong part I have
box issues so it's pretty sweet because
you can either subscribe annually where
you get four boxes a year for 100 bucks
so 25 bucks a box or you can do a one
time thing for twenty nine dollars and
there's over a hundred dollars or the
products in here this one the candy
Johnson one actually has over a hundred
fifty dollars worth of products I'm
definitely keeping this box so here's
what the inside looks like nice peachy
like neon peach kind of color and when
you take it out you see candy well
there's actually a pretty sick photo or
drawing whatever the has a list of all
the products on here on the back I'm not
gonna look at that yet because I kind of
want to be surprised keep you guys on
your toes again super cute packaging oh
heck yeah okay I already see some super
exciting stuff it's not like
individually wrapped so I can kind of
RTC everything also if you're interested
in trying out this box yourself I do
have a five dollar off coupon code for
you guys I will put it right here also
the link will be in the description box
with the code like always everything you
want to know is down below okay actually
just saw a commercial for this on TV
last night this is the Garnier skin
active clearly brighter brightening a
smoothing daily moisturizer and also by
the way this isn't just like random
sheds
is candy Johnson's favorite stuff so
this is the brightening and smoothing
daily moisturizer it has SPF 15 in it
and looking on the back it says that it
has vitamin c and e pine bark essence
okay like the bottle the blog the bottle
looks really nice and kind of like sleek
I just want to smell this so I'm trying
to do in life oh it smells like smells
like something else smells very fresh I
like how has SPF 15 so you can apply
this underneath your makeup I will
definitely be given us a try does this
card have prices on it hey the card
doesn't have prices on it so I'm not
actually sure how much you should be
things are okay yeah it's like this is
like a deluxe size of the Too Faced
better than sex waterproof mascara I
actually have this sitting in my drawer
but I haven't tried it yet I love love
love the normal to face better than sex
that's my holy grail mascara use it
every single day but look at this
packaging it's not pretty next this kind
of ironic because I've literally been
trying to use this up for like the last
year this is actually in my bathroom
right now I actually really like this
stuff I just I have like five billion
oil so I'm trying to use it up but this
is the Neutrogena ultralight cleansing
oil when I'm not super lazy at night I
like to go in with a cleansing oil
versus like a wipe I usually use this
after a film when I have like a ton of
makeup on my face it literally takes off
everything you put this on dry skin rub
it in you can use on your eyes doesn't
burn my eyes at all and I have super
sensitive eyes if you're using cleansing
all you definitely still want to go in
with a face watch after so that oil
isn't like still in your pores or
anything but I love this it's a very
lightweight oil like you can see it kind
of moving looks like water in there well
sounds like there's like a bead in here
this is the redken fashion waves 07
texturizing sea salt spray hell yeah
super excited to try this haven't tried
a whole lot of redken products did you
like they're pink line like the diamond
oil basically supposed to give your head
that way vbg just got out of the water
not really trying kind of look and this
is a huge bottle like this will last you
forever okay next up we have this
smashbox brow tech and the shade taupe
to actually probably match when i
finally go silver with my real hair see
I've never heard anything
this as little things in it looks like a
liquid eyeliner tube but it's not it is
a brow product folks oh it's interesting
it looks kind of powdery on there it's
pretty much like a powder but on a gel
eyeliner brush the tone looks a little
bit to read for me what is this all i
see is blemish clearing and i want to in
my life so this is the Ben Zach acne
solutions blemish clearing hydrator and
it says it has East Indian sandalwood
oil has 0.5% salicylic acid my skin love
salicylic acid I don't react that well
to benzoyl peroxide so I'm glad this is
salicylic acid lightweight formula
controls excess oil hydrates the skin
yes this is like basically the last step
in your skincare routine and i'll
probably be using this at night i don't
usually like to use acne products
underneath my makeup so definitely going
to give this a go because we all know i
need some help in the acne department so
then we have a cover effects brush i
haven't tried any of cover FX this is
brushes looks like this is one end
foundation one end concealer i'm
guessing i don't usually apply
foundation with these kind of brushes
because i like a bigger like buffing
brush but I can totally apply a face
mask with this probably and this looks
like it could be a nice concealer brush
really carving out your brows or just
blemish concealing ok next up we have
this NYX ombre lip duo is it ombre or
hombre things ombre so basically this is
supposed to let you easily create an
ombre lip do you have like darker on the
outside and then it kind of fades into a
lighter shade ok first of all its
retractable a second it has this fine
point it's basically like a liner so you
could actually like get in the lines of
your lips what a concept then there's
this lighter orange shade oh I'm
probably gonna do a look using this I
don't think I've done a orange lip look
before ok few things left in here I
think one actual product and then
there's sound like sample size things
this is the NYX jumbo eye pencil in
cashmeres is like a super pretty gold
shade I love the next jumbo eye pencil
so one in milk is great for your water
lines like a pure white pencil you can
use these for so many different things
use that as a base for your eye shadow
you can use it just as eyeshadow alone
you put on your waterline is a super
affordable awesome love the NYX jumbo
eye pencils samples these are the LA
fresh instant cooling of body soother oh
they're basically like wet wipes for
your body and oil-free face cleanser
keep those in the first they give you a
card to get fifteen percent off and free
shipping on the Edit by 17 which I'm
guessing is a new fashion site this is
the versus spa face moisturizing gradual
tanner alright that was everything in
the box I feel like for 29 bucks that is
a super good deal will leave a link to
the beautycon box down below and you can
also use code summer peace love that's
like the happiest discount code ever to
get five dollars off if you guys like
