schmooze on look I'm wearing right now I
wanted to do a kind of like
non-traditional holiday wintry kind of
look I don't know I'm picturing like
winter wonderland in my head and this is
what happened makes sense in my head I
try to have a ton of new products and
brushes in this video also the Coastal
Scents revealed smokey palette which is
brand new this launches December 11th I
posted on Instagram about this and also
some swatches so if you want to see
those you can check out my Instagram the
Tayla same it's my youtube name and
everything else let me know down below
if you guys would want to see a full
review on this palette once I have fully
tried it out look at the packaging if
you guys want to see how I got this look
you're in the right place just keep
watching
all right so I've already done my
foundation just to save some time today
mix the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
with pure minerals 4 and 114 our
foundation this stuff makes your skin
look so freakin pretty it just literally
looks like skin that's kind of like the
finish of the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation and it has pretty good
coverage I did a whole shadow and
shmooze using this if you want to see
just this product alone with some Manic
Panic because it is super dark for my
skin tone mix these two to lighten it up
I like how it turned out I did try it
with the elf brush I think is just the
like stippling or foundation brush or
something for the first time and I
really like this brush since it is
pretty compact it gives pretty good
coverage for like 3 or 6 dollars
whatever this is I really like it does
anyone remember when elf used to be a
dollar so we're gonna do the rest of the
face I think I'm going to start out with
brows right now I have tons of all new
products in this little basket what is
this called container that I'm going to
use for the first time in this video so
this is the bulletproof brows by Too
Faced this looks like it's a gel kind of
situation and it comes with this little
spoolie and brush so lets spoolie it out
I've just been so just satisfied with my
shape the shape of my brows lately like
brows always going good faces and then
really bad phases definitely in the
water right now why it's on pretty easy
just to darken it up a little bit I'm
gonna go in with my normal Ulta brow 10
in deep this is my Holy Grail brow
product we're just gonna run this
through I just love the color of this
and just makes your brow shape stay in
place I have a few of these Sigma these
are their new highlight and contour
brushes from their face architect's line
and I love this brush this is the fo3
high cheekbone highlight I love this for
highlighting I've been using it every
single
it just like fits perfectly on your
cheekbone and it's easy to blend out
this one is super like flimsy so I'm
thinking it might be good for bronzing
if you just want like a light bronze and
then this one is definitely more for
packing on a contour I think I do have a
20 or 10 percent off code so I'll link
that in the downbar as always also all
the products I used on my face will be
linked down there too so oprah sent me a
giant box of things to try out so i'm
going to go ahead and use this egyptian
clay bronzer they're pretty pricey if
you don't have a coupon code but i think
Kathleen lights has a code I think is
Kathleen Forney that's the best code
I've been able to find which is 40% off
your whole order this looks so pretty I
might use this as a highlight later but
I think we're just gonna blend these top
shades and do like a little bit of
bronzing action with the f30 7 brush
let's just see what this is all about oh
it smells good this brush is actually
perfect if you have like a super deep or
pigmented color that you're putting on
your face because this would have
definitely been too much if I use my
normal bronzing brush I feel like I'm
going to take a little bit of just the
lighter shade right here and just put
this on the temples now that we are nice
and bronzed it's almost a little bit too
warm for my skin tone but I think once
we have everything on it'll work out
just fine I'm gonna go in with my new
child I think we're actually we're gonna
go back in bronzing powder and take that
shade this looks super pretty oh yeah oh
yeah do you guys see that I think this
one actually shows up on camera cuz it's
like freakin intense and then just on
the tip so Real Techniques has this new
kit that comes with this little clutch
thing and there's like five how many
brushes are in here sigh brushes I'm
going to use this powder brush if I can
get it out of here these brushes are
literally glued in here Real Techniques
brushes are supposed to be really good
affordable options for brushes from the
drugstore I can get them out altar or
the drugstore the only thing is that the
handles are pretty big so if you're
trying to put them in a brush holder
they do take up quite a bit of room go
for a blush in pink satin
this nice light pink shade I'm going to
do a really icy kind of like purpley eye
and lip so I want to light pink blush
I think this brush could be for powder
oh this is so soft yeah
or for blush whatever you're feeling
this one's out so easily I don't know
what this brush is supposed to be for
you could totally use this as a
highlight as well maybe like a giant eye
brush so I'm going to go in with the eye
primer from Ofra it says it's a gel
primer I'm usually not a fan of these
like super liquidy kind of see-through
primers if you know what I mean chip I
don't know I just like the more thick
kind of like the Mac Paint Pot I just
love that I'm gonna let that set and
just spray the face with my holy grail
setting spray l'oreal infallible pro
whatever this is okay so for eyes look
at what is coming out this comes out
December 11th I think yeah I retails for
$19 this is obviously it's supposed to
be a little bit similar to the Urban
Decay smoky palette this is the first
time I'm playing around with it I have
swatched it but I haven't actually put
it on my eyeballs yet so this will be
kind of a first impression situation I'm
gonna try and do like a matte cool toned
look and then some crazy eyeliner just
gonna go in with I think this light
shade right here this is a matte shade
okay on that Real Techniques brush and
this is pretty big but I'm just using
this as a base to set that primer then
go in with a mix of these two shades
right here this is like a lighter tan
shade and this matte gray put this in
the decrease I don't know when this
video will be up but I just posted my
day one of vlogmas log thank you guys
for all of your encouragement for doing
vlog acha I really appreciate the people
who said don't do
if it's gonna stress you out your health
comes first I know I'm gonna try with my
migraines I'm gonna do my best I don't
know what's gonna happen there really
isn't a lot I can vlog during the week
because I do work so I'm kind of like
pre recording a few bits and pieces
that'll probably just compile into a
couple I feel like that'll be more
entertaining for you guys and easier for
me I'm just blending this kind of all
over the crease leaving the center of
the lid blank and I was taking the
lightest shade in here and putting this
on the lid with that Real Techniques
brush
I'm going to go in with this silvery
kind of shade and put this on the lower
lash line I'm super excited to try this
this is the new color pop crybaby they
came out with tons of gel eyeliners and
I just watched it like right before this
video but I haven't actually used this
yet it's like this light
periwinkle no lavender there's the color
eyeliner and I think we're just gonna do
like a lavender wing with it so I'm
using the Real Techniques a little
eyeliner brush that comes with it gets a
little bit crumbly if you try and layer
on top of what you already put down let
me know down below if you guys like
music playing in the background of these
videos or if you just like it to be my
voice sometimes I feel like background
music can be nice but sometimes I also
feel like it gets really annoying yeah
this really doesn't layer well at all
kind of like you got one shot and you
gotta make it happen
here's what it's looking like if you
have a darker skin tone this would
probably show up a lot better I'm going
to take this Terina
Terina Tarantino eyeliner I got this off
of glambot and it's actually so freakin
crazy this is the shade glitter mist and
it's like a pearlescent your descent
there we go it's an iridescent kind of
color I think we're going to either put
this on the inner corner or just on top
of that line it's not really picking it
up as much as it is in real life but
next I'm going to take a white eyeliner
and we're just gonna put this on the
waterline since we have a light eyeliner
going on this look is gonna be all about
the lashes and whatever lashes use are
really gonna stand out since you don't
have like a dark line covering up your
lash line I'm gonna start out with a
light coat of mascara I'm just using my
pretty much dried up version of Too
Faced better than sex mascara even that
like you could go just mascara look how
bright it makes your eyes look this is
just like out to party today
well that dries before you put on
falsies I'm going to go in for lips and
use color pop brillz this is a purple
color no cold coffee
this is way too purple than I want it by
itself but I think once we
then we're gonna go in with the NYX
matte green lipstick and rose do you
guys remember when these came out and
everyone was all over these hey this is
still way more like bright and purple
than I want so I think I'm gonna go in
with and nude
I'm gonna try adding some color pop
skimpy on top yeah I think this is just
too dark to start okay we're gonna wipe
it off
that's a little bit more what I had in
mind I just kind of half wiped it off
and then put on skimpy over top so
lashes let's do this this is the 102
Demi's by Oradell these are like on
their last was the thing they've seen
better days but I think we have like one
more use out of these lash glue I've
been using lately is the ski tow
companion lash glue mostly just because
I love the packaging look at this rose
gold I'm gonna apply a tiny bit of
bottom mascara if you like the look of
only top then you could just leave it
like this but I feel like it looks weird
when you can see my like blond lashes
down here so I'm just gonna put on a
little bit of the falsies push-up I
don't really like this with bottom
lashes but I'm just trying to use this
up before I repurchase my wet wild mega
length alright so this is the final look
I hope you guys like this video if you
