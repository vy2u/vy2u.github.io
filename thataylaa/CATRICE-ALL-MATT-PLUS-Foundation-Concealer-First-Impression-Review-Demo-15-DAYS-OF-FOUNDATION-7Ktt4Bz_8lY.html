foundation if you're new here this is
going to trying out a new foundation
every single day for 15 days if you miss
the previous days you can check the
playlist down below it'll have
everything there but today we're trying
to have the Catrice all matte plus shine
control makeup along with their
concealer just thinking this is the
Catrice liquid camouflage high coverage
concealer so I haven't heard anyone talk
about this I've heard a little bit about
the concealer haven't seen any reviews
or heard anyone mention this foundation
you can get this at Ulta believe their
European brand volta now carries it it's
a drugstore foundation it retails for
$8.99 which is awesome
you get one fluid ounce of product in
here it has a glass bottle which is
classy and there's also a pump there's
only five shades of this foundation on
the Ulta website which is definitely a
downside this is a shade zero ten light
beige this is the lightest shade they
make and I do some shade swatches for
you guys so you can see how it compares
to some of my other pale foundations
okay so I just want to show you guys
some swatch comparison so you can see if
it's going to be light enough for you
this is the Catrice foundation this one
is Lancome 10 idol Ultra all these are
in the lightest shades by the way this
one is hard candy glamoflauge foundation
this is Marc Jacobs remarkable so well
 so these three are obviously quite
a bit lighter than this probably two
shades lighter it looks like to me keep
in mind that all three of these are too
light for me warm by themselves they
look a little bit ghostly I could do it
but it definitely looks like it's a
little bit light when I use these
foundations I typically mix in a darker
foundation with it but if these match
you this one definitely wouldn't so
let's read some of the claims they
actually have some on the bottle so it
says it's supposed to be mattifying
long-lasting it's oil-free says it lasts
up to 18 hours long-lasting shine
control makeup with light reflecting
pigments very satin matte and even
complexion hydrating oil free I'm going
on altas website see if they say
anything different on Ulta it says it
controls unwanted shine all day long
oil free with full coverage fall is
finished without a mask like effect
we'll see how it wears throughout the
day but since
an oil controlling makeup is probably
not geared towards people with dry skin
probably people more on the combo oily
side which is what I am I have
combination skin with cystic acne I like
full coverage foundation if it has some
kind of shine controlling properties
that's kind of always a bonus because I
do tend to get a little bit shiny on my
t-zone throughout the day but I don't
like a totally totally matte finish I'll
wear it but it's not my favorite like
always you can leave any foundation
requests down below and if you like this
series give it a thumbs up so I know if
you want to see how the Catrice all
matte plus foundation apply somewhere
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching
alright so I've washed as my voice
unfavorite just I've washed moisturize
and we're about to prime half of the
face this is Laura Mercier primer that
we used yesterday though I'm just gonna
apply this to the right side of my face
yesterday we don't really see a
difference I'm going to give this morphe
sponge another go since we didn't really
try yesterday with the Tarte foundation
this shape is like oddly appealing to me
like I could just sit here and squeeze
this all day then we're going to go in
with a brush on the other side of the
face wow this is a glass bottle that has
a pump that's super exciting for a
drugstore foundation or for any
foundation and when Dad this on and then
first go in with the sponge and try and
blend it out and smells like baby wipes
yeah actually smells exactly like baby
wipes I like how it's applying with this
bun and shade wise looks pretty good
just with one layer on this side of my
face it looks like we got about a high
medium coverage with a sponge down apply
the same amount to the left side of my
face with a brush
okay right off the bat we definitely got
better coverage with the brush and it
looks a little bit more matte with the
brush yeah that pretty much like covered
everything I think I like the way it
applied with a brush better if you like
we got more coverage and I just think it
looks better so I'm going with a tiny
bit more on this side of my face and
just anywhere else where we need a
little bit more coverage right now it's
looking like a really nice satin finish
we'll see once it sets and kind of dries
down but so far I'm liking it looks
really nice builds nicely doesn't look
kick here anything when you add more
product on top if you're lighter than me
I think this shade would be a tiny bit
too dark I don't think it's like a super
super pale foundation but for me it's
doable as long as it doesn't oxidize
looks really good right now looks really
healthy looks like a healthy kind of
satin finish I would say this is high
medium to full coverage sitting really
nice on the skin it's not clinging to
any of my dry patches on my forehead I'm
going to apply the concealer this is the
Catrice liquid camouflage high coverage
concealer and I haven't heard anything
about the foundation but I have heard
good things about concealer for your
pale princess I think we have hope with
this I think this might be like enough
says it's waterproof and I'm the shade
0:05 light natural which is the lightest
shade has a doe foot applicator oh yeah
this is definitely light enough heck
yeah
it always rocks when you find the light
enough drugstore concealer
looks really nice not as high coverage
as the Urban Decay Naked concealer or my
collection cosmetics concealer but looks
really nice definitely is brightening
definitely light enough if you have pale
skin this could be your jam before I
powder I set the under eyes inside the
face I'm gonna show you guys a close-up
so here's without setting the under-eye
concealer or anything finish looks
really nice right
look this is usually what my forehead
looks like after I said it like the
texture you can't really see as much of
the texture as usual right so right now
it's 1156 I'm gonna apply the rest my
makeup and I'll be right back I'm back
so I'm just setting my under eyes and I
noticed that it's actually starting to
set pretty mad I don't know if you guys
can see that but it looks a lot more
matte than I did five minutes ago still
has a tiny bit of a satin matte finish
but it's definitely way more math than
it was before still a tiny bit sticky so
I'm just going to set probably the
center of my face and where I'm going to
apply brush and bronzer brush a brush
and bronzer oh man so I'm just going to
put a tiny bit of the celebration
foundation illumination from a cosmetics
my forehead Navin sting and then just
whatever's left over on the brush here
just so I can blend out bronzer and
stuff all right now I will be right
alright so the rest of my makeups on I
use the new Milani like a rose gold it's
called chromatic addict zero one and I
use that with a tiny bit of the 24/7
urban decay naked liner so it looks
really good everything blended out
easily on top of it I like the finish
I like the coverage I feel like it was
just kind of effortless to apply now the
rest of my makeups on I feel like it
definitely looks a little bit dark it's
totally doable for me but I would
probably mix in a tiny bit of mana panic
or a lighter foundation when I wear this
I do like my foundations to be a little
bit lighter so it like totally matches
my neck I just did this shading
comparison so as you guys on the shade
swatches is quite a bit darker than all
my other pale foundations the concealer
is definitely a pale princess friendly
if you're super pale try out the
concealer so far I'm liking it we'll see
if it creases but just the way that my
powder applied on top of it and
everything I do like the concealer so
it's now 1225 getting a late start
because I woke up with a migraine this
morning so I'm going to wear this as
long as possible we'll probably till
like 8:00 or 9:00 at night and we will
see how it wears throughout the day it's
now 5 o'clock p.m. so the foundation has
been on for almost 5 hours let's take a
look so I'm getting a tiny bit of smile
lines right here around the nose area
looks good everything else looks good I
don't actually yeah like no oils coming
off on my finger blush bronzer highlight
still looks really good
I'm sure guys are close up so you can
see the mouth lines really quick okay so
I don't know if you guys can see that
but there's the mouth lines right there
everything else looks really nice here's
the forehead thank you zit I'm heading
to the farmers market right now so I'm
probably going to be wearing sunglasses
and I usually get like sunglass marks
right there we'll see Oh what is in my
eyeball we'll see if I get really bad
lines with this foundation now that it's
been on for a while I definitely think
it looks a tad dark next time I wear
this I'll definitely try mixing it in
with a lighter foundation what is in my
eye okay so it is almost 9 o'clock p.m.
at night I feel like I need to go to
sleep right now I'm so tired I think is
from being out in the Sun just took a
shot of what my face looks like in
natural lighting which I will insert it
right here but just almost drop my
camera on the hardwood floor so that was
fun
so foundations been on for almost nine
hours now about eight and a half and as
you can see in the natural lighting clip
I think it looks pretty good it is
looking a lot more reflective on my
forehead in this light than it did in
natural lighting I did wear sunglasses
earlier obviously and the lines aren't
nearly as bad as they usually are I
usually have to like free put makeup on
over because I get such bad sunglass
lines on my nose these ones aren't bad
at all and it was like hot outside it's
getting a little sweaty and they don't
want that at all I definitely think
I would use this again next time I use
it I'm going to mix it in with a lighter
foundation if they made this a shade
lighter that would be awesome
primer side versus not prime side looks
exactly the same to me and the concealer
I do like I'll be using the concealer
again not super full coverage but it is
light enough so if you struggle with
finding a drugstore concealer that's
light enough try this one this one is
super pale but it's eight bucks if
you're looking for a good coverage
long-lasting foundation I would try it
out if I were you return it if you don't
like it but that is it if you guys liked
this video give it a thumbs up so I know
if you guys are excited about this
series make sure you share it tell your
friends do what you got to do
love you guys thanks for watching and
see you in my next video fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
