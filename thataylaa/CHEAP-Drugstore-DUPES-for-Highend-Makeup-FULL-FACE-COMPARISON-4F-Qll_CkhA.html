on this look half of my face right now
is high-end half my face is all
drugstore affordable products so
basically went through my entire
collection and found a bunch of dupes
for high-end makeup I literally spent
hours going through my makeup stash to
try and find the closest dupes that I
could find this is a freaking project
you guys I decide to share some of these
with you though because I tried to find
not talked about dupes a couple things
are well-known dupes and then the other
things I really tried to find things
that I haven't heard a lot of people
talking about so I hope you guys enjoy
this video if you do any point make sure
you give it a thumbs up let's jump into
the makeup if you want to see how I got
this look you're in the right place just
keep watching hiccups okay so change up
the background a little bit we have some
greenery going on Thank You IKEA I
actually have a light behind my head
right now and I feel like it's making
the background a little bit more bright
and true to color so let me know what
you think
alright so hi inside of my face is going
to be this side and drugstore affordable
side is going to be this side of my face
let's do this I'm excited so for primer
on this side we're going to be using the
bodyshop all-in-one instable
is basically a blurring primer just has
a very silicone feel to it rub this in
like you normally would and I have
already washed and moisturized my face
like normal and on the other side of my
face and be using the la girl pro prep
HD high definition smoothing face primer
this has pretty much the exact same feel
to it clear silicone feel primer
okay so foundation for me I think was
the trickiest thing not because of the
formula but because of shades I feel
like every shade of foundation that I
own is so different that it was really
hard to find something that I could make
match both sides of my face so I do have
other foundation formula dupes in mind
but this one was the closest for formula
and shade let me know if you'd want to
see a separate video on just foundation
dupes but on the high-end side of my
face I'd be using the make up for ever
ultra HD foundation and on the other
side la girl pro coverage HD HD HD
foundation I just did a whole review on
this during 15 days of foundation I'll
link that video down below I think I
actually sat in the video this
foundation or
me of the makeup for everyone this one
is a little bit more illuminating I
think I have why 205 and are 210 here in
this foundation and then I have
porcelain in this foundation with the
white mixer so basically I'm going to
use two different palettes right now and
try and mix these two together and mix
these two together to get kind of the
same shade okay so let's go in on this
side I'm actually just using the shade
are 210 and I'm just adjusting the LA
girl foundation to hopefully match the
other side of my face I use my Real
Techniques sponge let's go in so for the
other side I'm just going to pounce my
sponge on a paper towel just make sure I
don't have any more product on there
let's go in for the LA girl side so if
you saw my review blue this one's kind
of peed bit later whoops I might need to
add some of the darker shade I have yet
let's do that also the shade fair here
and the LA girl foundation so I'm just
going to put a little bit of that on the
back of my hand this shade is way too
dark for me but I think mixed in it
might be perfect right now there we go
so if you saw the review video on this
this one doesn't hold up very well on me
throughout the day I definitely think
the makeup forever one lasts a little
bit better but formula wise these are
pretty similar to me this one is a
little bit more illuminating but
coverage and consistency and everything
it's pretty similar instead of doing a
second layer today I'm just going to
spot conceal to cover up a little bit
more of my scarring and freckles and
stuff concealer the closest dupes that I
could find where the NARS radiant creamy
concealer and the collection cosmetics
lasting perfection I love this concealer
very similar coverage and consistency I
actually prefer this one I have two
shades of the NARS here of Chantilly and
vanilla Chantilly is the lightest one
I'm probably going to mix these two
shades to match the shade on the side of
my face gently' is definitely one of the
lightest concealers I've ever found in
this pretty yellow tone this one has a
little bit more salmon tones to it I'm
going to go ahead and apply this side so
I can see how much of Chantilly you'll
need to mix in to match it today's a
weird day guys having like a super late
start feel a little out of it had like
four cups of coffee okay so now I'm
going to go in with colleges tiny bit
chantilly just to match to blend that
out going in with my favorite more Fiji
38 concealer brush Hana I use it for
concealer for under-eye powder I almost
always set my under eyes with a white
powder so my under eyes actually look
bright and not the same color as my skin
tone for the hide inside I'm gonna use
the it cosmetics
janessa quaff this shade right here it's
a white powder and on the other side my
Holy Grail under eye setting powder is
the stargazer powder it's like five
bucks off of Amazon I'm gonna put it
right here actually recommend that one
over this one but this is the Manic
Panic virgin pressed white powder this
one just doesn't have nearly as soft of
the consistency as the other one but I'm
totally out of stargazer and I ordered a
new one a couple weeks ago and it still
isn't here so today I'm using this one
but just know I definitely recommend
stargazer over the Manic Panic going in
with Manic Panic
Manic Panic is a little bit more
pigmented I think this eye looks a
little bit brighter so I'm just going to
go ahead and add a tiny bit more of the
cosmetics powder and see if we can get a
little bit more white under there powder
and the eyeballs oh definitely just
realize I was going to spot conceal what
happened to that don't go it back in and
spot conceal now so I'm taking that same
same concealer as I used under my eyes
amuse a spot conceal typically I would
use something a little bit darker to
spot conceal I don't have a dark enough
shade of this concealer so that's okay
it will make it work I'm just adding
concealer anywhere I need a tiny bit
more coverage we are onto face powder so
one of my all-time favorite setting
powders that I actually stopped using
because unfortunately this one I think
breaks me out is it cosmetics bye bye
pores press powder fun try this one
again and see if I still break out from
it because when I was using this my skin
was to begin with and then on the
other side of my face I'm going to be
using the NYX HD finishing powder this
one makes you look like freaking a
beautiful airbrush matte doll like skin
so going in with a cosmetics and then
going in with NYX
Oh duffer brows I have two very recently
discovered products one of them I have
fallen in love with the benefit
precisely my brow pencil I think I
mentioned this in a video a couple weeks
ago but I've been using this pretty much
every day every day during 15 days of
foundation I used this product on my
brows I love this I have the shade 4 and
it's kind of like a perfect match for my
hair and brows right now it's definitely
quite ashy
I just love how this has a super super
fine point waxy but it's not too waxy
where product doesn't come off it's just
a perfect amount of pigment where you
can actually like draw on hairs and then
on the other side I'm gonna use the LA
girl shady slim brow pencil in brunette
product is pretty similar the benefit
one I think it's a little bit waxy errs
is a little bit easier to control but
this is a new product from la girl and
very similar the color of these are
pretty dang identical let's prime the
eyes so I'm gonna use a Too Faced shadow
insurance on this half of my face and
the Milani eyeshadow primer on the other
side I feel like this is a very
well-known dupe the wet and wild eyes
shadow primer why am i using my left
chin right now great ideas Taylor the
wet and wild eyes shadow primer is
another option I also got that one this
one is actually kind of taking away some
of the coverage of my concealer right
now not if you guys can see that but
that's okay we're gonna just be putting
eyeshadow on top of it both of these
seem to be kind of rubbing away some
concealer on my eyes but the Milani one
definitely less so than the Too Faced
while that primer is setting we are
going to go in for the face so the
contour dupe I'm really excited to show
you guys because these are pretty much
almost exact dupes and I have been using
the drugstore version for a while and I
really like it so on the high-end side
using the Anastasia
Nastasia contour kit in light to medium
this is what it looks like and then on
the other side I'm using my Olay girls I
love makeup contour palette this one has
almost exact dupes for every shade in
this palette so I'm just going to go in
with this middle shade and then the
shade right here
my opinion I think this is one where you
can definitely just get away with the
drugstore version so the brand makeup
revolution is kind of known for doing
dupes of products so they pretty much
did an exact dupe of the Too Faced
sweethearts plush and candy glow they
made the blushing hearts blush in candy
queen of hearts so here they are next to
each other cute face one you have to
pick up quite a bit of product to get
any kind of color payoff you can
definitely use a lighter hand with the
makeup revolution one you don't need as
much product at all I'm having this
weird Hot Cheetos craving phase right
now where I literally crave hot cheetos
24 hours of the day it is 10:00 in the
morning right now and craving hot
cheetos so let's do highlight this one
was really hard for me to choose which
one I wanted to show because I feel like
I actually found a lot of highlight
dupes I think we're gonna do a Becca do
so this is the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector in pearl this shade is the
only shade of the Becca highlighters
that personally work on my skin tone
roll looks really pretty I just think
there is definitely a way cheaper dupe
essence eyeshadow and zero one snowflake
if you've seen any of my videos I talk
about this all the time this is an
eyeshadow but is freaking amazing as a
highlight if you have more fair skin
tone this is such a great dupe this is
literally a couple dollars it's super
soft and buttery not like a glittery
eyeshadow it just gives you a beautiful
beautiful Sheen to your face I am
actually not a huge fan of Becca
highlighters they just don't last very
well on me feel like they kind of wear
off throughout the day but that's just
me go in with our essence shadow right
here
oh I just picked up way too much all
right we're gonna have to make the other
side a little more intense Lorene does
not think I was going to need more of
the essence so I just like put my brush
in there go back in with Becca
I'm just running whatever's on my brush
down the center of my face both sides of
my eyes are feeling primed and ready to
go so this was no easy task you guys
some reason especially with eyeshadow
I'm like very particular about Dukes if
it's not the same shade I don't want to
call it a dupe you know I'm saying so
this took me a long time try and find a
shadow dupes for this going through my
entire collection and I found a few
different dupes for shades in the Anna
osya Modern Renaissance palette I love
this palette I love the shades in it
love the quality of it so I have three
shade dupes here wrote them all down a
couple of them are coming out of morphe
35o m palette which is another great
matte warm eyeshadow palette so we're
taking golden ochre on this side of my
face and then this morphe shadow that is
two down and three over in the morphe
35o M palette I'm gonna be using the
same brushes but I am wiping in between
shades just so we don't get any
crossover and I'm just gonna blown this
straight into the crease I really know
what look we're going for right now but
we'll find out soon now going on with
that morphe shade all the products
brushes everything I use are always
linked down below in the description box
so these look pretty dang identical Oh
in the modern Renaissance palette and
then take this corner shade right here
which is Cypress umber it's just a
really deep kind of chocolatey brown
shade and in the morphe palette I'm also
taking that corner shade right here even
though some of these shades in the
modern renaissance palette look pretty
basic when you actually look at
undertones they actually are pretty hard
to match so these are definitely like
the closest matches I could find putting
that right into the outer corner we
might do like a halo eye maybe we'll see
yeah I think we're actually gonna do
that so I'm just bringing whatever is
left over on the brush I'm going to put
that right on the first third of my eye
now we're basically gonna pop a lighter
shade right in the middle the morphe one
is a tiny bit more pigmented but a
little bit trickier to blend out the
thing I love about the Modern
Renaissance palette is that they just
blend out so easily I'm just going back
in with the modern era sense and just
kind of packing and blending I feel like
I gotta sneeze I'm just gonna take an
empty blending brush and go ahead and
blend those edges a little bit
Vermeer in the modern renaissance
palette was actually really tricky to
find a dupe for and I found one by
mixing where'd you go Jake a beauty
triple crown a baked shadow and cherry
fudge sundae if you mix these two light
shades right here there's a pinky shade
and then this like champagne colored
shade and if you mix those you get
pretty much an exact dupe for Vermeer
for the lid shade on both sides I think
I'm actually going to wet my brush so
I'm going to take Vermeer to start and I
was going to pop this right on the
center of my lid and then we're going to
go back and blend
so if the edges aren't blended with that
Brown is okay a lot of the shades in the
modern renaissance palette remind me of
like Bridal makeup I think a lot of the
shades in there could be really good for
wedding makeup just going to take that
same brush and go back and kind of blend
those edges now mixing the two shades
I'm kind of just mixing them on my brush
think this one what is actually even
more metallic than the modern songs this
is for good pretty so both those I think
are really pretty okay man down for the
bottom lash line I think I'm actually
going to go back in with our to contour
palettes to start I'm going to take that
same shade that we use to contour and
then I'll probably deepen it a little
bit with this other shade both palettes
notice gonna kind of smoke out the lower
lash line I actually don't think I need
the other shade on the lower lash line I
am going to go in for my inner corner
with the same highlights that we used on
my face so becca and then the essence
eye shadow i'm just going to pop that
right on the lower lower inner corner I
guess the lower lash line I want to do a
nudie color because that just helps to
open up your eyes a little bit so I'm
doing the cover effects perfect pencil
on one side and then the makeup geek
nude liner on the other side this cover
effects pencil you can actually use to
like carve out your brows and you can
use it for different purposes you're
someone like me who gets red eyes really
easily a lot of eye shadows irritate my
eyes and eyelash glue and everything
putting a new liner in your waterline
that doesn't irritate your eyes can help
to make you look a little bit more awake
unless red eyed I'm super excited about
this eyeliner dupe one side I'm going to
do my Stila stay all day waterproof
liquid liner and on the other side wet
and wild proline felt tip liner these
are literally almost identical except
this one is like under five bucks I
actually have the mini version here but
it weirdly matches this I love both of
these I've been using this one the past
few days and it is very similar it lasts
really well throughout the day next time
I probably just honestly wouldn't
repurchase this one and just go for the
wet wild I think I might actually prefer
the applicator on the wet and wild one a
little bit better it's a tiny bit
stiffer so it's just easier to flick and
get that wing without the brush kind of
like wiggling all over mascara is one of
those things that I feel like
just total personal preference but my
Holy Grail mascara is a Too Faced better
than sex mascara the key to this one for
me where you don't get it to transfer is
to open it and let it dry out for a
couple weeks and then use it and it
won't transfer when you first open a
tube of this it does transfer to the top
lashes at least for me the Rimmel
scandaleyes retro glam mascara is
supposed to be a dupe for this the wands
are very similar the retro glam actually
looks a tiny bit bigger to me but we're
gonna see how it goes today
I usually only put on one coat of the to
face mascara so we'll see if I can do
the same thing with this Rimmel mascara
the formula on this feels a little bit
more dry not as wet as the Too Faced I
mean they look pretty similar bottom
mascara if you seen any of my videos I
always use wet and wild mega length
mascaras my favorite mascara for the
bottom lashes it doesn't transfer has a
super tiny wand so you can just get in
your lashes really easily the high-end
sytem use the julep length matters
mascara this has a very similar tiny
rubbery wand my one wild mascara is
actually kind of running out right now
so hopefully I can get the same kind of
black going oh totally forgot to
set my face alright well I'm gonna wait
for my mascara to totally dry before we
go in with a setting spray I snapped
about this when this was going down but
lips loose another thing we're holy
I think I literally swatched over 100
liquid lipsticks lipsticks lip glasses
to try and find a dupe major props to
anyone who does full collection dupe
videos like the kylie kit dupe videos
holy duck femme liquid lipsticks
that are pretty close match and then
also normal lipsticks not sure which one
to go with I'm gonna tell you both of
them so if you like lipsticks over
liquid lipsticks you could just go with
that but this is NARS and nita I love
the formula of the NARS audacious
lipsticks and then this is color pops
new cami matte X lipstick NARS is on the
bottom camis on the top this one has a
little bit more pink tones in it for
sure I think they're on your lips I
don't know if you would really be able
to tell honestly you guys I just watched
so many of these that all the color
started to melt together and I feel like
I didn't even know what was going on in
the world anymore so on the bottom is
the bomb committed and then on the top
is la girl dreamy we doing a lot of la
girl I just realized pretty similar this
one looks a tiny tiny bit more pink rosy
to me I think I'm going to go in with
the
with lipsticks today I love the way that
these smell their super minty I kind of
get a little bit crusty throughout the
day and drying but the smell of these is
so amazing that I overlook it this is
where to never put lipstick on half I
live and I'm gonna do the LA girl side
and hope that these look similar on the
lips pretty similar I think this side is
a tiny tiny bit darker and I had all
over my teeth but I'm going to put a
gloss over top so hopefully that'll help
even everything out color wise these are
almost the exact same this is the Too
Faced lip injection gloss in the shade
spice girl and then this is the aimer
gloss in 800 rosy lips I love the Too
Faced injection glosses they do have
that burning sensation but I personally
enjoy that going in with all May on the
other side this one has a weird scent to
me it reminds me of like Halloween candy
from third grade kinda smells like stale
lollipops I've talked about this before
on my channel but dupe / even better
version in my opinion to the Tasha
luminous dewy skin mist is the hard
candy sheer and be hydrating primer mist
this is technically a primer spray but I
actually use this as a setting spray if
I want super dewy finish actually get
more intense do with this and this
doesn't do a whole lot or make my makeup
last longer in my opinion a key with
this is literally putting on one or two
sprays you get super intense do if you
put on more I think it can actually kind
of not break down your foundation
throughout the day but it just is too
much I actually really don't like this
Burger on this thing it's definitely
like a fine mist but it's almost too
fine where I feel like nothing's really
coming out right so well that's dry and
let's go in with hard candy boo what's
nice about - oh I think I switched the
crap I forgot this is a brand new bottle
I usually have my black top on here from
my other hard candy bottle for whatever
reason the white top has a weird
spritzer and you just changed it out
with a black hard candy bottle squirter
it is a lot more pleasurable of an
experience let me tell you we got my old
bottle out of my empties bin that I've
meant to film for like two hundred years
back in business you pretty much get the
same do with one spray that you do with
like 15 on this side alright this is the
final look if you liked this video make
sure you give it a thumbs up so I know
you can let me know down below any of
your dupes that you found I'm very
curious your
here you can join the burrito family and
subscribe I upload pretty much three
times a week Monday Wednesday Friday
usually foundation Friday is every
single Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time love
