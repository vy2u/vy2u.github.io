you're obligated to get things you don't
need at all
all right so today I'm doing a full face
this looks testing out all makeup from
Claire's Claire's to me is like my sixth
grade self your piercings the jewelry
that'll change your hands colors that
you never knew could change it in a few
videos where people try out like kids
makeup from Claire's but they actually
have a full-on makeup line so I wanted
to see if any of its good see my sauce
on it test it out when I was shopping
online it was buy three get three free
off of pretty much all cosmetics as soon
as I saw that I was like alright let's
load up the cart we're doing this video
so I hope you guys like this video idea
if you enjoy it while you're watching
don't forget to give it a thumbs up if
you're new here you can subscribe and
join the Buried as well be video family
to upload Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m.
6 times let's put some Claire's makeup
on my face I'm actually pretty excited
about this I thought it was going to be
plastic but it's a blast
top quality Claire's top quality
literally right as I just sat down to
film some dude just started singing like
lives throwbacks out there so hopefully
you guys can't hear him he's actually
pretty good kind of she could hear the
wash moisturize in prime my face I use
the elf prep in hydrate balm today
because my skin is feeling pretty dry
actually from being or just in the
mountains for like a week I think I'm
actually going to start out with eyes
today I don't know why I just kind of
want to use tape I'm going to tape mood
so I'm going to tape the corners of my
eyes just to make eye shadow easier you
think tape just kind of lets you have a
cleaner line so when you peel off the
tape your eye shadow is just like a
perfect line it doesn't get you know
places you don't want it to be oh and I
got new piercing eyes in San Francisco
before Tahoe and Stephanie Nicole and I
hung out you guys saw that if you follow
either of us on Instagram but we went to
get piercings so I got this little guy
which is so beautiful this is like a
real diamond and then this one and I
also got my tragus I didn't find an eye
primer on Claire so I'm just going to
use my makeup Forever aqua XL I've been
using this shade this is m-52 well this
is like exploded from the mountains but
I've been using this as an eye primer
and I've been really liking it so as you
can see the stuff is pretty opaque which
is also just going to help make the
eyeshadows I put on top of it kind of
pop got two different eyeshadow palettes
to try out the first one is the
beautiful romantic shadow palette this
kind of looks like the Naked 3 palette
well they got too protective sealants on
here here are the shades and I didn't
plan this with my shirt but
this is actually going to work out
pretty well I've distillate too which
has some like cool tone glittery shadows
in it but then I also have these glitter
liners and there's a gold one in here so
they be able to a silver and gold look
that might be fun so I got this palette
because online it looks like these were
matte but now that I'm looking at these
I think all of these are shimmery this
pella is $9.50 and this palette is $10
so pretty much drugstore prices this
packaging feels much more sturdy and
better quality than this one this one
was like on clearance in China this
packaging feels like the shittiest
cardboard packaging they could have
chosen but I think i'ma start out with
this shade right here just pop them out
into the crease these shadows are super
deep set in here so it's kind of hard to
actually get to the color there's like a
quarter of an inch of space between the
foam and the actual eyeshadow so your
brush kind of gets like frayed when you
go to put it in I'm going to take this
white cream shade this one actually
looks like it's matte right here so I'm
going to take that to put underneath my
brow bone I think whoa that one feels
super soft and that picked up a lot of
product super curious about these
glittery shades doesn't have a whole lot
of actual glitter in it yeah there's
definitely just a glitter overlay on
these when you actually get down into it
just kind of like a shimmer with a few
specks of glitter try this one ooh what
the actual heck is up that one just got
super talking this looks like those
fiber mascaras this is making me cringe
look at how that just watched you guys
can see this it's like friggin chunky
and chalky not putting that anywhere
near my eyeball I'm gonna go in with
this brown shade right here and I'm just
going to deepen up the crease did
anything just come off of there so I'm
gonna take the darkest brown shade right
here next to black see how this goes
these would seem to be blending nicely
not the most pigmented or anything but
not horrible then go and do cool tones
like on the outside and then do a
ton of gold glitter we're going to take
an eyeshadow break and do brows because
it's going to bother me okay so I got
this for our product this is the
two-in-one brow pencil looks like you
have a brow gel on one end and then a
pencil on the other and this was in the
darkest shade this one retails for
799 so I think I'm actually going to use
the brow gel first just to see how
pigmented is and then just kind of fill
in the shape a little bit more with the
pencil feels super dry like it feels
like nothing's coming off of there but
it is adding a little bit of color
because like I'm putting a dry mascara
wand on my eyebrows right now I think
the color is a little bit warm for what
I usually like feels like almost a
powder whoa this is super pigmented
really creamy feeling which I actually
don't like for brows because you can
really easily go overboard with it and
it just looks like you kind of crayon
your brows definitely going to be
cleaning these up with concealer the
color of the pencil is a lot closer to
what I usually like for my brows kind of
like a more cool toned deep brown I'm
gonna take a little bit of my BH
Cosmetics 102 concealer I didn't find a
concealer on Claire's so good she's
singing just besito yes he is might as
well go with the black let's try the
black glittery shade right here when I
dip my brush in there I got a ton of
Fallout on the outside of this palette
so I'm just tap it off it looks really
glittering in the palette but when you
blend this out I'm not saying any
glitter it kind of just looks like a
dark grey not super pigmented black so
these are technically liquid liners you
get seven in here for twelve fifty again
since everything was buy three get three
free all this was like way cheaper than
it normally would have been so I'm
thinking I want to put this gold glitter
all over my lids and just use it as like
a liquid eye shadow kind of thing kind
of like the Stila liquid metals oh it
looks like there's a lot of there there
we go
glitter on the actual one I much prefer
using liquid glitter over any kind of
powder glitter you just don't have to
deal with the fallout whoo look at that
this is totally working as eyeshadow
okay I'm going to see if this right side
is kind of dry it still shows a little
bit what the limpid dries I'm going to
go ahead and add a tiny bit more just on
the areas where it's not totally opaque
still wet yeah does take a bit to dry
which is kind of concerning since these
are supposed to be liners actually got a
separate liner that I'm going to try
this is a two-in-one felt tip liner I
was really curious about this because
the point looks really fine so I want to
try this one too but there is a liquid
liner in this set but since this is
taking forever to dry oh just be wary if
you try this as a liner you probably
want to keep your eyes closed for a
couple minutes so it doesn't transfer
when you
open your lids okay even though it's
still wet I'm just going to dab a little
bit more on certain spots looks really
nice a shadow I don't have a single
speck that I can see as fallout
everything is staying on my eyes
penetrates about this white shade and my
haze is on the inner corner but I think
I'm gonna do my face makeup first gonna
let this dry for an hour basically you
can still feel it what on my lips I
think I'm actually going to keep my tape
on for the liquid liner because why not
and then when I take it off I can always
go in and touch it up but if you leave
the tape on I mean you already have like
a line there for use so if eyeliner is
eight bucks which is really reasonably
priced for a liquid liner doesn't say
anything just says two and one so I'm
assuming there's two different kinds of
tips on the outside of here they
actually look exactly the same
I think they just copy pasted that image
you look pretty similar this one is a
little bit shorter than this side I'm
going to go in with a smaller one
because that's what I usually like so
it's been a few minutes and I swear it's
still wet kind of one does go in with
the liner and live my life because this
is a little ridiculous at this point
it's been like over five minutes let's
line these eyes very block feels a
little bit rough going on but it's super
black and super matte I'm just falling
against that tape is I'm going to take
it about halfway down and connect it
okay that was not bad I'm going to take
the other side and cover that glitter a
little bit more try to I have a feeling
this one might be one of those liners it
dries up super quickly because I'm
already having a harder time getting
product out on this side could just be
the angle to that I'm doing it at a
little bit tricky to get product out of
here now am I going to take this off now
I think I am good time oh look at that
look at that line I mean you can't beat
that that's your like the glitter has
dried down a bit but it's still a little
bit sticky when I touch it I think this
was the only foundation product I could
find on that this is the Claire's BB
cream and the shave light they had a few
different makeup sponges on there and
this one the colors just like intrigued
me so this is the size of this thing in
the Box I did already dampen this and it
stayed the exact same size
feels very firm and it didn't really
soak up any of the water at all when I
went to dampen it so let's try to sponge
out on this side it really feels like
I'm hitting myself with a rock whoo what
does that smell
that's a sponger the product I think
it's a sponge actually smells horrible
this sponge is an else this is going
straight in the trash you have a little
bit out of Tanner left over and trying
to get it all off second film foundation
videos tomorrow but it's like stayin put
so let's trade actually looks pretty
light which is nice I think this would
match me well with my normal skin color
and this isn't looking too hot
definitely is light coverage but the
cover just side it just looks pretty
horrible it's giving me like major weird
texture super matte but it's just
clinging weird try mixing this in with
foundation since I definitely don't like
how it what's on its own
every time icing this with the
Maybelline why did I just forget the
name of brand superstay better skin
foundation in the shade the lightest one
just going to ply it right over the side
and then just go in with the mixed on
the other side even mixed in with that
foundation it just looks super textured
and heavy and cakey on my skin it
actually almost looks exactly like the
Kat Von D lock-it tattoo foundation how
that one sits on my skin like I said
Brender my eyes and be using the BH
Studio Pro concealer since I couldn't
find a concealer in there I'm going to
do that set my under eyes and face and
I'll be right back is the maybelline set
me loose powder in the shade 20 I think
there were a couple bronzers on Claire's
website but I didn't actually pick me up
because I thought there was going to be
a bronzer in the palette called bronze
but there's not apparently these are all
highlighters so I just went ahead and
used my ELF st. Lucia bronzer and the
blush in here but I'm going to try out
the highlighter in this thing I got
super excited when I saw this online
because there's a white highlighting
shade in here you get for highlighter
shades this one looks way darker online
and it also looks kind of matte feels
nice and stop this highlighting palette
is $12.99 packaging feels again super
cheap but we'll see how the product is
I'm excited I'm just using the Sigma SOS
re brush to try us out that looks really
nice doesn't look super textured I'm
trying a little bit of this shade right
here which looks kind of like a light
banana shade almost woo that's also
pretty
kind of a champagne it's not blending
out the easiest I think that's the
foundation I have on right now because
even my powder blended out weird on top
of that I mean though it's pretty then
take that second lightest shade and just
highlight a little bit right here yeah
product is just clinging really weird on
top of this BB cream anything literally
just sticks I'm going to take that same
white highlight shade and put that
underneath my brow bone a little bit I'm
also going to pop that on the inner
corner yeah that was pretty on the inner
corner to where I still want to try that
white glittery shade I think too
something is making my eyes super red
right now
lower lashline time I'm going to go back
into that first shade I use from this
palette blend that down I think that's
all I want to do on the lower lash and I
kind of want the focus to be the top
we're going to put on bottom mascara so
it'll help let's try out this mascara
this is their this mascara is fergan
vacuum-sealed this was 750 this is their
two in one mascara there's a liquid
liner in here and a mascara so I guess I
actually got three liquid liners great
okay so here's the liquid liner on the
top and then I'm assuming you screw this
back on and then yep there's some
mascara looks like a bigger kind of
rubber one to putting on Claire's false
lashes too so I'm just going to do a
thin coat of this to coat my natural
lashes not doing a whole lot kind of
just giving me natural looking lashes if
you mat eyes burn so while that's drying
before I put on these false lashes
let's do lips I got two different lip
products depending on kind of what look
I was going to do this one will
definitely not go with this look so I'm
going to skip on this one but this is
the two and one lipstick and lip gloss
it's just like a twist up lipstick red
lip gloss this I'm so excited about look
at this packaging it's not the cutest
thing ever
this is a strawberry flavored pizza lip
gloss I mean this doesn't scream
Claire's I don't know what does so $5.99
dude look at this thing
feel like my ten-year-old self would be
screaming right now actually my 25 year
old self is internally screaming right
now I don't really know if this is a
pizza looks kind of like a snack well
wish it on top of it does this thing
open whoa okay just dug it in there I'm
actually going to cover my lips in
foundation to get that nude going and
then I think I'm just going to top it
off with that light pink color little
hack if you don't have a nude lipstick
so I'm taking my fingers take the
lightest one I think that's pretty clear
and I should let's take a little bit of
this purple one okay going off the dark
pink one but that has a little bit of
color there we go
actually I think I like that purpley
shade it has a little bit of like a blue
tint to it strawberry scent isn't too
strong like when it's on my lips not
really smelling it a whole lot okay well
maybe if you like deep breathing you can
smell it they had a bunch of different
lashes on there actually and they carry
a lure which I love I lower lashes 1:21
fox is sitting right here these are some
of my favorite lashes I didn't want to
get the I'll or brand nose since you can
get those at Ulta and I've tried those I
wanted to try out declares brand these
ones were six fifty which is actually I
feel like really pricey for these feel
like they should be like two or three
bucks like the elf false lashes
6:54 Claire's false eyelashes seems
definitely steep so everything they were
having a sale on this lash glue on the
Claire's website three four five dollars
this is the aisle or strip lash so I
picked up three hopefully they're good
definitely new trim piece where you add
so there's where you add so far so good
on the lash glue
okay so lashes are on my eyes are
definitely a little bit irritated from
something right now I don't know what it
is the band on those lashes feel nice
and light last step is lower lash line
mascara where did I put some mascara you
guys should see this desk right now okay
I would always just looking at this
thing
how does a giant-ass huge black tube go
missing oh here it is looking for a
black tube and there so I'm going to tie
this for my lower lash line I usually
like a much thinner one for that getting
a little bit clumpy down there I'm
actually still really curious about this
white one so I think I do want to add a
tiny bit of this to my inner corner this
probably won't dry for a year but okay
definitely a little bit less glitter
payoff in that one alright so this is
the final look testing out Claire's
makeup I think out of everything I'm
most into actually the liquid liner uses
eye shadow if you have time to let this
thing dry but it looks nice do like that
gold glitter this eye shadow palette is
a definite pass for me I think this is
the biggest reject as far as just like
the formula and quality of its eyes the
glitter I think the second runner-up
as things that I liked is this
highlighting palette this one looks
really nice right now I'm going to keep
trying this out I do think it didn't
blend quite as well because of the
products underneath my face right now
the liquid liner I was semi and press
buyer I do like the way it looks it
wasn't super difficult to work with it's
really black and matte like I said I
have feeling this is going to dry up
just the way that it feels
overall I kind of just feel like you can
make some of this stuff work but it's
just a bit overpriced for what it is
I find a lot of better things at the
drugstore for around a similar price if
not cheaper so those are my thoughts I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
