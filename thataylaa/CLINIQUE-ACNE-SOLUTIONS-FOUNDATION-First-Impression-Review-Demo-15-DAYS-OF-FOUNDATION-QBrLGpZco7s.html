right now
all right so today it's day 9 of 15 days
of foundation this is where I test out a
new foundation every single day for 15
days who's sick of hearing that feel I'm
sick of saying it there's new folks
watching every video so you got to do
what you got to do
well we're on this fields if you're new
here you can join the burrito family and
subscribe new video goes up every single
day 6 p.m. Pacific time during the
series days 1 through 8 are linked down
below in the season 4 playlist also if
you go on my thumbnails any thumbnail
that has the little purple day number
banner on it that's the season that I've
mall color coded by season so you can
separate them out so today when you're
trying out foundation I haven't heard
anything about this isn't a new product
it's actually pretty old I believe but
this is the Clinique acne solutions
liquid makeup can get this foundation on
Sephora it retails for $28 for 1 fluid
ounce of product this comes in 15 shades
I the lightest shade 0-1 fresh alabaster
why does the name of that make me crave
like clams or seafood fresh alabaster
fresh lobster that's where my mind just
went I'm gonna serve swatches right here
so you can see how the shade zero one
compares to some of my other foundations
alright swatch iron right here is a
Clinique acne solutions foundation in
the lightest shade is 0-1 fresh
alabaster next to its the Clinique
beyond perfecting foundation and 0.5
breeze Tom Ford foundation that I
reviewed yesterday this is in the shade
1.5 cream derma called to 0-8 Urban
Decay Naked Skin Foundation and 0.5
josie maran vibrancy foundation in RG 5
and pierre cosmetics bear doll in
porcelain this is the weirdest
description i've ever seen for a
foundation this is literally all this
has won Sephora an eight hour wear
liquid makeup that neutralizes redness
and blends away blemishes first of all
why would you want to say something only
has eight hours of wear eight hours
aware is like nothing that kind of
worries me because I have combination
skin I usually get pretty oily
throughout the day under the little
Sephora check marks it says this for all
skin types and the coverage is medium on
the bottle it says it has salicylic acid
acne treatment in it the active
ingredient is salicylic acid 0.5% so I
like that as you're wearing this in
theory it should be kind of helping your
skin so that is it folks on this one if
you want to see my thoughts on the
Clinique acne solutions makeup and how
it applies no worries there at the
you're in the right place just keep
watching why does this not want to focus
on my face right here bro
so I just checked this I'm gonna squeeze
some out Rd wash moisturize in prime my
face everything will be listed down
below I'm gonna start out with a brush
on this side of my face
it feels really lightweight blending
this out with the eyelash extensions I
don't like to bring foundation on top of
my eye like I usually do so I'm just
gonna go in with the concealer cover up
my eyelids looks a little bit dry in
certain parts
let's do forehead Oh looks pretty dry on
my forehead okay just matching me
perfectly right now if it doesn't
oxidize cleaning foundations usually
oxidize pretty badly on me like a couple
shades the finish looks a little bit
better on the sponge side but I'm not
getting as good of coverage so probably
the best way to apply this you want
coverage is use the brush and then go
back over it with this button just
smooth it out even going over the center
of my forehead with the sponge still
looks pretty dry and textured yeah it
kind of just clings to any dry patches
you have right now I'm at about medium
coverage low medium coverage I mean you
can still see everything I think I'm
gonna go back in with the sponge and
just see if we can build this up a
little bit mostly just down here to see
if we can cover the acne okay so that's
covering a lot better on the second
layer definitely already oxidizing I
would need to mix something in with this
because it's the right shade when it
goes on but when oxidizes it's already
too dark making my pores look huge oh my
nose area it's already starting to
crease in there since this says this is
only supposed to last eight hours which
is a little ridiculous one so right now
it's 753 a.m. I'm gonna do the rest of
the makeup and I'll be right back okay
so it's now 819 we're gonna call the
check-in time eight o'clock since that's
when I finished out my face so I ended
up setting my face with the Laura Geller
balance in Brighton powder and porcelain
this is one of my go-to setting powders
this does help to lighten up my face a
little bit so I feel like the shade
looks a little bit better now I mean you
can definitely still see its oxidized
but it looks nice right now with the
powder on it it looks like kind of a saw
- Matt kind of finish my forehead
started looking a lot better once I put
the powder on so right now I don't mind
how it looks there's definitely still
acne coming through I think it's kind of
interesting that since this is geared
towards acne you'd think they would make
it more full coverage and say no people
with acne are gonna be using this
product but something I like is that it
feels super lightweight on the skin when
you put it on and just wearing it I
don't feel like I have a heavy
foundation on at all it feels very oh
great no one people say foundation is
breathable and you're like what the heck
does that actually mean
this is one of those foundations to me
that actually feels breathable feels
like I can move my face my face doesn't
feel sticky doesn't feel heavy at all so
on the rest of my face as a bronzer I
use the pure anata medium matte contour
powder this is actually from Etsy I did
a full face using Etsy makeup blush is
makeup revolution blushing hearts I
tried out the BH spotlight palette again
as a highlight I use this J and vivid
today which I really like it looks a lot
darker in the pan it's actually like a
light pink kind of highlight super
pretty eye is literally all I did just
put that same contour powder in my
crease then my lipstick is maybelline
superstay matte ink in voyager I don't
think I've actually worn one of these
throughout the full day yet so we'll see
how this holds up - all right now it
feels kind of sticky which I don't
really like so I'll see you guys in a
few hours in natural lighting I have a
 ton of editing to do today wish me
luck all right so it's now 104 in the
afternoon so it's been on for five hours
so it looks a little bit masked like
right now it actually looks super smooth
on my cheek area but my forehead looks a
bit heavy and I'm major creasing going
on on my upper lip that is some major
creasing underneath the nose area to
move that highlight thing
overall doesn't look horrible right now
I just want to say I like how it looks
by any means and this is some intense
creasing still feels pretty lightweight
but I do have some like burning going on
on my acting down here I don't know if
that's the salicylic acid doing this
thing but it's kind of uncomfortable
don't feel it as much on this side
mostly just over here but I'll see you
guys at the end of the night it's now
it's super weird to go now 6:30 to so
it's been on for 10 and a half hours
I haven't oh what's that oh great it's
just like out to party right now I
haven't touched up my lipstick at all
ten and a half hours it actually looks I
think exactly the same as last check-in
at five hours which is actually pretty
good for only being marketed as a it
hour foundation I was leaning my head
over here and it kind of totally rubbed
off on that side so I wouldn't say this
is like transfer proof or anything do
exact thoughts his last check in the
main area was where it just looks bad
it's like my upper lip creasing same
exact thing so yeah around the nose
upper lip my forehead doesn't look bad
I still feel it burning a little bit I'm
assuming that's to sell soap acid I
don't know if I'd wear this again for
that reason I'm not usually a fan of
having my face burned throughout the day
it's not as bad as it was earlier I
almost thought I was gonna have to like
take it off early nothing with this one
really stands out to me out the powder I
definitely didn't like how this looks
with the powder doesn't look bad doesn't
look great probably wouldn't reach for
it again usually when I mix something
the product has something that another
foundation doesn't and this one I just
can't really think of what that is
besides it's also acid which is burning
my skin again for the 50th time so I
don't know this one just seems kind of
pointless for me man we need a freaking
winner this is like kind of a bust
serious so far we need some winners what
is tomorrow's tomorrow need a 10 but if
you guys are enjoying this series don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up
love you guys thanks for watching see
you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
