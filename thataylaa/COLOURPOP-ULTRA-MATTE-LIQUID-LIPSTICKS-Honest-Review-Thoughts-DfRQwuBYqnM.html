right so today we have a review slash
just sharing my thoughts on the
colour-pop ultra matte liquid lipsticks
I have like 5 billion right here it's
actually oh gosh like 3 rows of them
down there I'm pretty sure I have the
whole collection here if you've seen any
of my videos lately I might have used
these and/or mentioned that I have mixed
feelings on them I'm not going to be
swatching these because there are tons
of swatches out there and props
to people who swatch these they do not
budge there are tons of swatches videos
on these so if that's what you're
looking for
feel free to go find it this is just
gonna be my thoughts and what I think of
these guys so color cosmetics came out
with some ultra matte lipsticks when
they launched they had a really good
range of like nudes to super bright
colors they've now moved into the like
crazy blues and greens and blacks and
stuff I feel like the liquid lipstick
trend is spreading like freaking
wildfire right now it seems like every
week a new brand is coming out with some
form of a liquid lipstick which is
awesome I love liquid lipsticks long
lasting liquid lipsticks are kind of the
only lip product that i religiously wear
these guys retail for 6 dollars each
which is definitely the most affordable
liquid lipstick out on the market
besides the essence ones which aren't
very long-lasting so super affordable
you can get these online colour-pop and
that's it Flambeau does have color pop
sometimes I've watched a lot of reviews
on the I don't know maybe I'm just the
only one who isn't completely obsessed
with these but I feel like they're so
drying just so you have an idea of what
I think it's a good liquid lipstick
Stila cosmetics stay all day liquid
lipsticks are frickin amazing they're
pricey they're in the $20 range but they
are moisturizing they literally last all
day and I just love the way they smell
and they feel on my lips that is like my
ideal liquid lipstick for 6 dollars
these aren't horrible they're super
pigmented to things I am NOT a fan of
with these is that they're incredibly
drying I'm surprised more people don't
mention that in these videos these are
very very drying if you have chapped
lips or you just can't stand the feeling
of like dry lip products you'll hate
these these are definitely the most
drying liquid lipstick I've ever tried
the upside to that is that you put these
on and it dries superfast in about like
five seconds and they're completely
dried on your lips and you're good to go
the second thing I don't like is that as
these wear throughout the day might just
be on my lips but it totally fades on
the inner part like the outer portion of
my lip will be completely fine the inner
portion after I eat like oily food or
dressing or something will completely
wear off I hate that I'd rather it fully
come off everywhere rather than you have
like a ring of liquid lipstick around my
lips just not cute especially when I'm
at work and I don't want to go in the
bathroom and be like reapplying liquid
lipstick that's a huge downside for me I
really don't want to have to reapply
these they also don't reapply well so
when you put a second layer on top not
looking cute with that being said I have
been reaching for these almost every
single day just because I have three
shades that I am freakin in love with
they got the colors spot-on
I feel like color pop is really in tune
with like what's popular and what people
will want to buy they came out with
literally eight shades that are all very
similar which I really like because not
every color looks the same on every skin
tone and so to have a range like this is
actually really nice for people of all
different skin tones that's something I
appreciate their colors are great a plus
on the color range the Reds in this
collection are all beautiful succulent
is one of my favorite colors it's a
orangie red color I wore this in my
fabfitfun unboxing and post a few photos
on Instagram lax is beautiful this is
like a super deep red burgundy kind of
color the ones that I've been wearing
pretty much on the everyday basis is
MIDI and trap trap is what I'm wearing
right now it's like a mauve muted kind
of stone color if you're my skin tone
MIDI is a great everyday kind of color
without too much pink in it love mister
jellies this is one of their new colors
they recently launched a bunch of colors
for the fall which are like these crazy
fun colors which I'm all about koala is
a nice purple if you like liquid
lipsticks and you want something that's
affordable with tons of colors these are
worth a try I don't think they're
absolutely horrible I give these like a
B I feel like the fact that I still
reach for them every day it says
something but I think it's just because
I really love the colors I usually do
apply a gloss or like a
stick on top of these just because my
lips feel like they're gonna crack and
like fall off price out of consideration
I think that the Stila cosmetics liquid
lipsticks are amazing the la splash ones
are great those are definitely more
drying than the Stila ones but more
moisturizing than these guys I think
those retail for like thirteen to
fourteen dollars colour-pop just has
such an insane color range that I feel
like any look I'm going for it's just
easy to whip out one of these colors and
put it on you don't need a lip liner
with these if you mess up there's no
going back I have to be really careful
with my lip ring when I put these on
because as soon as you put these on your
lips it's stay in there if you mess up
you're kind of screwed I've posted a lot
of Instagram photos in these so if you
want to see more of what they look like
on my skin tone then you can check out
my Instagram again if you're curious
about these things I think it's worth
the $6 because it's only six dollars
they're not the best I've ever tried but
they're not horrible try it for yourself
you can always look up swatches on
Google or Instagram or whatever I hope
this was somewhat helpful for you guys
if you liked this video give it a thumbs
up so I know I love you guys thanks for
watching and see you in my next video
bye
