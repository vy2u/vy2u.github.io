long-sleeve shirt in a fuzzy ass jacket
in these lights I'm like dying alright
so today for a foundation Friday we're
actually gonna be talking about
concealer I just wrapped up 15 days of
foundation in the wrap-up video where
I'm gonna be ranking all the foundations
and everything is coming on Monday so
skipping the foundation related videos
today and we're gonna be doing that on
Monday and then next Friday we will be
back to normal foundation reviews every
single Friday on my channel by the way I
totally overlined my lips today so no I
did not get filler or anything I just
went a little cray so I wanted to talk
about concealer today because there have
been so freaking many new concealer
launches lately this is like the season
of concealers I have been trying these
things out I don't think I've used my
normal concealers like the ones I
usually reach for in weeks because new
concealers have just been coming in and
I've been trying them out so some of
these I've been trying for weeks now a
couple of them are a little bit newer
but we're gonna be going over eight
concealers today there are some
drugstore concealers in here some
high-end ones are kind of all over the
place and actually all of these
concealers are also cruelty free so
that's a win but I've gathered my
thoughts I have some notes here we're
gonna go over the price point the
formula coverage everything but I like
about them what I don't like about them
I'm also going to show you swatches I
have the lighter shades and each one
these concealers so here we go so if
you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the bay REO family
and subscribe I upload Monday Wednesday
Friday 6 p.m. sip time alright let's get
into it let me get my notebook out here
PS how exciting is this notebook so the
first new concealer ruin talked about is
a milk make up flex concealer this
product retails for $28 and you get zero
point two ounces of product it comes in
eight shades I kind of always compare
concealer sizes to the Tarte shape tape
because this guy is a beast of a
concealer you get 0.33 ounces of product
in the Tarte shape tape which I have
found comparing these and other
concealers that that is that's a lot of
concealer so Tarte shape tape retails
for $27 but you get a ton of
product into heart shape tape though
again milk makeups 28 and you get 0.2 so
looking at the packaging I thought this
was gonna be a squeeze tube but you
actually get a doe foot applicator on
here the lightest shade is fair which is
quite dark this one with a more be a
concealer shade if you have light to
medium skin tone
if you have a fair complexion this is
gonna be way too dark for you so most of
you have probably already seen me apply
concealer before you know what my under
eyes look like but I do have darkness
and I also have freckles underneath my
eyes so I get a pretty good idea of what
the coverage is like because of that if
it covers my freckles for the most part
I know it's full coverage and if it
covers my darkness if my freckles I
still totally coming through it and my
darkness is still coming through
obviously gives me kind of a gauge for
how the coverage is so this one I would
say is medium coverage I don't think
this is full coverage it is very creamy
very creamy and almost to the point
where it's too creamy for me because
it's really difficult to set down and it
almost just freezes instantly if you
don't have issues with your under eyes
creasing and you like medium coverage
and you have very dry under eyes I think
you might like this one but only for
that person this creased way too much on
me I do like some medium coverage
concealers one of which I'll talk about
but just the formula this I definitely
would reach for other ones over this one
just for myself so the second one is the
Laura Mercier Follis fusion ultra long
wear concealer
retails for $28 it has zero point to
three ounces of product so tiny bit more
than the milk one for the same price and
it comes in twelve shades this was one
of those concealers that as soon as I
put this on for the first time and I've
been testing this one the longest out of
all these concealers I felt like there
was something special about this formula
it feels so moisturizing but almost like
a gel concealer but it sets down it's
very moisturizing but in a gel concealer
type away this isn't a super creamy
concealer thing I loved about this one
is that it moisturizes my under eyes and
it helps out with creasing so much
whether this is used on its own or mixed
with other concealers I'll tell you how
I like to mix this in a second on its
own it is medium coverage this is not a
full coverage concealer by any means I
also like how this one has a little bit
of radiance to it not where it looks
dewy it just looks almost like a satin
finish has a really pretty look to it
this one looks great on its own if you
just want something super natural like
on a natural makeup day if I'm doing a
full face look this isn't quite enough
coverage for me so I do like to mix it
in and the best way I found to mix this
also the shades and these are both too
dark for me I both the shades one
and 1c but more often than not I'll
reach for one n if I'm mixing it in with
tarp shape tarp heart shape table I can
always brighten up my concealer with
under-eye powders which I'll talk about
in a second the way that works really
well for me applying this is putting
this concealer on first all underneath
my eyes and I'm just using a tiny dab of
tart shaped tape right towards the inner
corner where I need that extra coverage
and brightness and I'll just blend them
out together with my morphe G 38 brush
and this makes the tart shape tape looks
so much more hydrating and smooth and
less creasing underneath my eyes this is
just a bomb concealer if you have issues
with creasing I think this one would
also probably be great on more mature
skin I do have a lot of lines underneath
my eyes where I typically always get
creasing it isn't nearly impossible for
me to avoid complete under-eye creasing
because I have lines there so naturally
even when I'm not wearing makeup you can
see the lines there this concealer I
feel like definitely makes them look so
much better than a lot of other
concealers I've tried so the next
concealer is one that I actually had no
plans of purchasing at all the thing
that first caught my interest was the
brightening powder this is the k'kaw Kim
Kardashian's beauty line the brightening
powder that's what I first wanted to get
and then while I was on the site I was
like well while I'm here might as well
pick up the concealer so I bought these
with my own money I'm not on k'kaw para
list or anything so I picked up the
shade one in the concealer and then I
got the lighter shade one of the
brightening powder I'm gonna talk about
the brightening powder a little bit more
in a second bliss first hit on the
concealer this is actually too light for
me which is great for using as a mixing
concealer so k'kaw concealer retails for
$18 but you only get 0.16
ounces of product so if you're comparing
the price per ounce with these other
concealers this thing is friggin pricey
it seems like it's a better deal because
it's only 18 dollars but you're actually
getting so much less product this
concealer comes in 16 shades I've used
this for a few days in a row now mixed
in and on its own on its own you get it
pretty dang good coverage I would call
this full coverage it feels very thin
and it sets almost immediately this has
the totally matte finish this is one
that you want to do one eye at a time
because if you go in and put on both
eyes it's gonna be fully set before you
can even blend it out so definitely work
one eye at a time on this one but it
looks pretty good
my eyes I don't get a ton of creasing
with this one at school because it feels
pretty lightweight but it's also full
coverage don't fight a platonic I really
like it reminds me of the Urban Decay
Naked skin has that kind of flexible
oval-shaped tip have it on right now
mixed in with another one I'm going to
talk about the flower beauty light
illusion so I like this one
I'm gonna order actually a couple more
shades to try and match what my under
eye should be the only thing I don't
agree with on the claims on here is that
it says it's hydrating I wouldn't call
this a hydrating concealer at all
doesn't make my under eyes feel
especially hydrated or anything it
doesn't make my eyes look more dry and
it doesn't emphasize creasing so that's
good I just wouldn't describe this as
like a moisturizing hydrating concealer
it was good enough for me that I want to
order more shades so while we're on the
k'kaw topic I wanted to touch on the
brightening powder because that's why I
was shopping on there in the first place
by the way I own like I don't even know
I own Kylie lip kits but I'm pretty sure
that's the only thing I purchased from
Kim and Kylie's lines like I'm not a big
k'kaw or Kylie diehard person I just was
intrigued by these products so I
purchased them but this brightening
powder though this brightening powder
let's talk about it because I am so
pleasantly surprised by this if I can
get this open I hate this packaging
there's something about this container
that I struggle with every single time I
try to open it pan size is friggin tiny
on this so this retails for $18 and get
0.127 so about 0.1 3 ounces of product
in here I think the closest thing to
compare this to that this product kind
of reminds me of is the Mac emphasize
powder I have the pan and the pan alone
without the packaging just the pan
refill retails for $17 baby 0.21 ounces
of product so a little bit less than
double the product for a dollar cheaper
so you really do not get a whole lot of
product in here at all I kind of
understand but also like give me more
product no I'm saying I understand the
sense because it's an under-eye powder
and they think people are going to be
using like small brushes and stuff so
maybe that's why but it just looks like
an eyeshadow and it almost makes me not
want to use it because I'm I feel like
I'm gonna run out of this super quickly
but I want to talk about the formulas
and everything because I'm gonna be
talking about it used with other
concealers I am so pleasantly surprised
by this powder because
as you guys know I have a weird skin
issues with powder especially under eye
setting powder I have my asically 3
go-to powders 2 of them by Physicians
Formula one of them more recently
discovered on the wish app the may cheer
pres battery very tricky to find an
under-eye powder that works for my under
eyes and this one does and it looks for
again and beautiful I have it on right
now it almost gives you a satin like a
satin matte finish it looks very
softening well I just looked straight
into that ring light are we here what
your is it it friggin brightens I almost
feel like I want to get the shade up in
this too and kind of mix the two shades
but if you have fair skin and you like a
really bright under-eye this powder is
beautiful and their website says
translucent this is not translucent at
all I think this is why I like it so
much because as nowhere near translucent
it definitely has color to it oh there
we go a little swatch aru hears
emphasized right here and here's the
k'kaw one why do I keep looking straight
into the real eye it's like when you
know you can't look at some things they
just stare at it anyways moving on to
the model zone cover it full coverage
concealer I have the lightest shade zero
one this concealer only comes in four
shades this concealer retails for $7.99
on altas website and you get zero point
two eight ounces of product so this is
actually hella cheap you get a ton of
product in here for eight bucks not a
big fan of squeeze tube concealers
because then you have to squeeze it out
tap it on either blend it out with your
brush or blend out with your finger I
just prefer doffo applicators if there's
a concealer like this sitting on my
table and then one with the doe foot
applicator and 99% of the time I'll
reach for the one with the other
applicator you know saying so the shade
of this one for me is good I actually
tried this out in a first impressions
video but I used it on top of another
concealer I'm gonna mention the makeup
revolution one which I did not like but
we'll get into that that gave kind of a
different effect then when I started
using this on its own when I started
using this on this own what I found for
me with this one is that you need a tiny
bit a little bit goes a really long way
it's very odd when I first put it on it
looks like it's gonna be super full
coverage as soon as I start blending it
out and kind of tapping it into my skin
I've tried it with a brush and with my
finger
it almost gathers a little bit
and the coverage disappears a little bit
it goes down to like a medium coverage I
can still see a lot coming through and
it doesn't look nearly as full coverage
as when I first start blending it out
this one also creases like crazy on me
it's a little bit too creamy and I find
with concealers like that even if I wait
a couple minutes to kind of let them set
in a little bit before playing a powder
or if I try it just straightaway
applying powder it just is too emollient
almost and it just creases a shit-ton on
me so for those reasons this one is it
passed for me next one is the flower
beauty light illusion full coverage
concealer this concealer retails for $10
and it gets zero point to two ounces of
product in it so pretty good deal I
actually wore this and showed you guys
applying it in the flower beauty light
illusion foundation during 15 days of
foundation I've tried it a bunch more
since then and I want to share your
share my thoughts with you guys so this
one is one that is so freaking beautiful
the formula this it can just be very
tricky to find a good powder that goes
along with it
at least on my skin when you first put
this on it has this beautiful
lightweight but full coverage radiant
kind of look to it I would say this one
has kind of a satin matte finish when it
dries down when you first put it on it
looks really radiant and then once it
kind of sets a little bit and dries down
it looks a little bit more satin matte
it's just a beautiful formula the shade
situation needs some help there's also
only four shades in this concealer and I
have the lightest shade which is fair
just want to either have to lighten up
with the face powder or lighten it up
with another concealer undertone of this
I like it's very neutral so I don't find
it to be too difficult to work with for
that reason it's not like super yellow
or super pink or anything like I said
it's been kind of hit or miss with
powders for me with this one I can't use
my normal setting powders with this
concealer by the way I'll have those
linked down below what I usually use but
I don't use that with this one because
it just looks like heavy crease city and
it just ruins the concealer underneath
the best powder I found of set this one
is the flower beauty is not the flower
beauty what is this called the cake a
dopey powder that again I can't open
this one with the flower beauty
beautiful so if you can find a powder
combo that works well for you with this
one and if you can find a shade out of 4
shades that you can somehow make work
for your skintone then
think this one is worth giving a go but
flower beauty can I get some more shades
please four shades four shades so next
up is one that I think is the worst like
you're getting the lease for your money
with this one and it's a little bit
ridiculous this is the bareMinerals bear
pro concealer this is a stick concealer
so just twist up like a little lipstick
either shades fair cool zero one and
fair light warm zero - I'm definitely
the shade very cool zero one and that
shade can work for me this one costs $24
you get point zero nine ounce as a
product let's just twist this up and see
how much that looks like there that's it
so that's all the way up this is the
concealer that you get and if you're
using that on a regular basis I don't
know you probably go through that hella
fast so that is pricey for 24 dollars in
that amount of product this would have
to be like the best concealer I'm
playing at earth for me to want to
purchase it at that price this one comes
in 15 shades when I actually put it on
and I'm blending it out I like it it's
just the creasing that gets me on this
one this one gives me massive massive
creasing but for a stick concealer it
actually blends out really easily it
gives a pretty good coverage it is
supposed to be full coverage like it's
pretty close to full coverage probably
like a low full coverage it's supposed
to last 16 hours they say you know maybe
it's just my under eyes but this looks
crappy after about an hour on my under
eyes I've tried it on kind of more
natural makeup days - because I was like
maybe this is one that I just need to
apply literally the tiniest amount and
just like blend it out and not put on a
full-on under-eye but same thing
happened it just does not look good
underneath my eyes so hard pass on this
one for me especially for that price
point alright next up is one that people
seem to either be like head over heels
for or they absolutely hate this one
this is the makeup revolution conceal
and define full coverage concealer and
contour this product retails for seven
dollars and you get point one one ounces
of product so you don't get a whole lot
of product but it's also only 7 bucks
it comes in 18 shades which is the best
shade range out of all these that I'm
mentioning so props to them that's great
so I tried this in a first impressions
video I've tried to make it work since
then and I really did not like it in the
first impressions video and I
found a way that I can make it look
better at the point where it doesn't
look like total sees but it doesn't
still look good enough to where outreach
for this over other concealers I don't
think this is full coverage at all on my
undereyes it does not look like full
coverage I have also tried this just
straight up on my scarring to kind of
use as a spot concealer to see if it
would cover that and it didn't cover my
scarring so I don't think this one is
full coverage but the way that I like it
better than how I was initially applying
it is the only way this one can look
decent on my under eyes is if I actually
put on my foundation and then I kind of
clean off like with the makeup remover
underneath my eyes so that the concealer
is going on top of my skin instead of on
top of a foundation and I feel like that
has made the biggest difference if you
have any concealers that aren't working
for you try that because sometimes
there's just too many layers of product
that you're putting it on top of but
with this one that actually works better
for me but again it's not to the point
where it looks good enough where I want
to reach for this one so the last
concealer is by ex1 and I've done a
foundation review on one of their
foundations before a concealer that they
just came out with is the delete'
concealer full cover and it comes in
kind of like a Mac Pro Longwear
concealer it looks exactly like that and
you have a little pump this one I was
not a fan of this one retails for $17
and you get point to 7 ounces of product
so you do a lot of product in here for
only 17 bucks so that's great it comes
in 13 shades I have the lightest shade
which is 1.0 and the lightest shade is
not very light at all kind of a similar
thing happens to me with this one that
happens with the model zone one where
you put it on it spreads easily you
think it's gonna be good it's looking
like full coverage then you kind of
blend it out and then the same thing
kind of like just gathers weird and
doesn't look like as opaque of coverage
as I was expecting with the full
coverage concealer so it almost is like
medium coverage to me once you blend it
out it doesn't sit the best underneath
my eyes this one feels actually pretty
similar to the model Zone one two in the
sense that it is very creamy but this
one is a tiny bit less sticky I just
would definitely go with other ones over
this xx1 one so those were the eight
concealers I wanted to just to second
touch on these two products because
these are new shades while we're talking
about concealers and a bunch of you guys
have asked me what I think of the new
shades the new light shades of the
Maybelline fit me and also the
Maybelline instant age rewind concealer
two formulas are actually some of my
favorite concealer formulas so I was
stoked when they were announcing that
they were coming out with lighter shades
so I have the lightest shade five and
then I have the lightest shade and this
one which is ivory so they recently
launched more shades deeper and lighter
and both of these are very very yellow
so I actually can't use these ones on
their own the lightness is right it's
just the undertone and the yellow that
is so off for my skin tone if you have
more of a yellow undertone or you like
the look of bright kind of more yellow
under eyes then you would probably like
these shades but for me the shades don't
work at all I actually prefer having the
darker ones the old old shades and then
lightening it with the powder because
they just look way better they just
don't work on my skin tone which is
unfortunate so I'm gonna keep sticking
with the shade 15 in this one 15 is
lighter than 10 so I always use 15 and
Maybelline fit me and then I use the old
shade I think it was fair the old
lighter shade is called fair whatever it
was that when I still use over this one
the color pop concealer I'm super
excited to try I need to purchase those
I don't have those in my hands yet but
I'm really excited to try because they
just launched a ton more shades and
they have a white one so I'm definitely
gonna pick up a few shades of the color
pop concealer I'll let you guys know
what I think of that in a different
video but let me know if you've tried
the color pop concealer what you think
of it down below or if you've tried any
of these I think out of these eight new
releases that I focused on I'm most
excited about the Laura Mercier again
for mixing or if you like medium
coverage and then my second would
probably be the flower beauty and then
the k'kaw for mixing and the powder if
you wanted the makeup on the rest of my
face I'm gonna quickly tell you right
now I'm trying out a combo for 15 days
foundation so I mixed the Becca aqua
luminous foundation with cover FX custom
cover drops set my whole face with the
sephora micro smooth powder but
eyeshadows use a palette that I'm still
trying to figure out what the heck I
think of this thing because I as of
right now I'm pretty underwhelmed by it
does the busy are neutral matte palette
and then on my lid I actually used a
color pop highlighter this is the luster
dust in the shade just for us I just wet
it with some mac's fix+ and then put it
on my lids my lashes are the kiss gala
lashes one of my favorites right now my
bronzer oh I like this bronzer a la
laura geller sunrise fair beach matte
bronzer
I think I got this off of hot look Laura
was on there the other day and I picked
up this bronzer shade and so far I'm
feeling I've used this a few times so
far we just have an eyelash chillin on
fenty right now but for highlight I used
the chic freak girl next door this one
right here
such a pretty highlight I cannot find
the blush for the life of me right now
but I used the laura geller swirl blush
I want to say the shade was cantaloupe
but I'll have it linked down below once
I can find it I need to clean this desk
massively and then my lips are Mac burnt
spice so I hope you guys enjoyed this
