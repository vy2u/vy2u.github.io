because I feel like this is something
that I've been wanting to do for a while
I have a cystic acne I've had it for
years I also have pale skin hello if
you've seen any of my videos you know
that I'm a firm believer in skin
confidence loving your skin no matter
what color it is no matter what
condition that's in we have one body and
it's your choice whether you choose to
love it or not and it's taken me years
to get to the place where I can say that
I am confident in my skin has not been
an overnight saying this has been a
journey over years I'm gonna leave the
video over here where I talk about
learning to love your skin at the end of
the day we have one body no matter what
shape color or anything you are it's
your choice to choose to love your body
and love your skin once you find that
confidence that's something that can't
be taken away from you by other people
in their words or their thoughts and I
genuinely hope that my videos or just
reading the comments section and hearing
that other people are going through the
same thing that you have I hope that
that helps you in some way if you have
asked me you know that it can be
difficult to find a makeup routine on
days where maybe you don't want to put
on a full coverage foundation and you
don't want to be wearing a ton of makeup
where your acne is still covered and you
feel confident and happy with your skin
but you can still see and feel your skin
so I have tons of foundation videos
personally I love foundation it's my
favorite makeup product category
whatever you want to call it I love a
good full coverage foundation it's what
I reach for most often just because
that's what I personally want to put on
my face but I feel like I've kind of
struggled for years trying to find a
makeup routine where I can cover my acne
but on days when I don't want to be
wearing a foundation I can still see my
skin and I can feel my face so kind of
the final push for me to actually figure
out a routine like this that works was
actually when I was in London Burberry
did a masterclass where they showed kind
of the super natural glowy look was
doing a live demo on a model who had
perfect skin and she was gorgeous and
they did a really natural
beautiful kind of glowy look and I loved
it but I thought I could never do that
personally on my skin that could never
work and when I got home I was not
feeling wearing foundation that day and
I just kind of started playing around
with products we're going to figure this
out so if you have acne or any kind of
skin condition and you've ever felt like
you can't achieve that more natural look
for your face just looks like your skin
I hope this helps you out so this look
is going to be more of a dramatic eye
and then just focusing on skin and being
able to see it and feel it I'm not using
any foundation in this video just
concealer so I hope you guys like this
and I hope it helps you out if you do
while you're watching make sure you give
it a thumbs up let's stop talking and
jump into the makeup I feel like I
finally nailed down a look that I love
and that I'm comfortable in feel free to
adjust this however you want if you
don't want to do a dramatic I'd don't do
it do you so whenever I do more of a
natural skin kind of look I always wash
my face and then I go in with the
polished choice BHA liquid the reason
why I start with this is because it
gives you such a pretty healthy kind of
glow to your skin
I literally just put a little bit on a
cotton pad and rub it all over my face
and that's where I'm getting kind of
this glow from right now since I'm going
to be putting mostly powders on my face
I still want to prime my face I'm gonna
be using the hard candy shear and the
hydrating primer mist I love this thing
for under and over foundation it does
give you a little bit of a sticky finish
so if you don't like that then don't use
this but literally you just need a
couple spritzes of this it gives your
face a really nice glow and it's also
going to help prime for the rest of
stuff we're putting on so the key for me
is not going overboard on the concealer
I feel like what used to always happen
to me is I would try and put too much
concealer on to cover everything up and
then the rest of my face would just kind
of look discolored so I feel like I
would need to put a powder or foundation
on so I'm just going to do super simple
concealer literally just on my acne and
where I feel like I need a little bit of
help I'm use the Maybelline instant age
rewind concealer this is in the lightest
shade this is way too dark for under my
eyes on normal days when I want to
brightens but when I just want my skin
to kind of blend in this works for under
my eyes and also for spot concealing
since it is closer to my skin tone color
so I'm just applying this right on the
acne spots if you want to you can take
off the sponge but I'm just going to
blend this in with my finger I still
want the color of my cheeks to come
through I want it to look
nice and natural and glowy so I'm not
going to be putting any concealer on top
of my cheek area but on the brain was
down my neck to cover the acne down here
and just make sure the edges are blended
really well so you don't see a stark
difference between your concealer and
your skin I like to avoid putting it
literally anywhere where I don't need it
so I'm going to avoid the center of my
chin right here because I don't want it
to look like a concealer beard down here
so my forehead right now is breaking out
pretty bad I hair covers most of the
spots over here so I'm just blending a
little bit so if you don't have dark
under eyes that you want to cover up and
you can just skip this step but I'm just
going to put a really tiny tiny amount
right on the inner portion of my eye
just to brighten up that area a little
bit I'm not going to set this with
powder when I use this amount I don't
really need to so I'm actually going to
use this same concealer to prime my eyes
since I am doing a full on eyeshadow
look today I want to prime my eyelids
this concealer actually works awesome as
an eye primer
there's something about really
identified and natural skin that I just
love I think I'm going to start with the
face and then we're going to finish off
the eyes lash cuz I'm going to go into
hourglass ambient luminous bronze light
this one if you have pale skin you have
to use a really light hand with because
they can look Orange pretty fast where's
my brush so I'm gonna take the Sigma F
15 brush this is a duo fiber brush and
I'm just going to lightly tap in here
tap it off and then I'm going to use
this just to warm up my cheekbones I
want super sculpted cheekbones because
it's just going to help pull everything
together I guess so me zoom is all over
my cheeks with bronzer and then I'm
going to go in with a different product
and school to my cheekbones a little bit
more whatever is left over on the brush
I'm just going to bring up to my temples
and just to tone that down a little bit
I'm going in with this and B powder
brush
roughly shoulda pinned back my hair like
ten minutes ago
so to sculpt out my actual cheekbones a
little bit more just make them pop on my
face I'm going to use a contour product
I love the elf eyebrow kit in the shade
light to contour this is a few bucks it
rocks I did a whole video on contour
products for pale skin but I'm literally
just going to apply this right to my
cheekbones this is a cool tone shade
they're just going to create that shadow
I'm bringing this in a little bit
further than I normally would just
because when you look at my face
straight on I really want to be able to
see my cheekbones if you want to you
could contour your nose a little
right now I never really contour my nose
but we'll just use whatever is left over
because I want a lot of life to my face
right now I'm going to go in this peach
blush literally peach toned and peach
scent cannot stand the smell of this
thing but this is a two-faced peach trio
thing I'm going to go in with this
middle shade right here you can use any
peach tone shade you have I like this
one because it does have a little bit of
a glow to it but if you want a drugstore
option NYX make some nice blushes I also
really like the L'Oreal True Match blush
I'm focusing this more on the apples of
my cheeks so I'm feeling majorly glowy
highlighted cheekbones today I don't
want a super shimmery highlight I just
want it to look very glowy and almost
wet so I'm going to go with the
Maybelline master strobing liquid
seriously what's in my Bible this is
more of a pinky toned liquid highlight
I'm going to go in with the powder one
on top of this but this just adds a
really pretty look at that one of my
favorite highlighters for that kind of
wet look is the goddess of love triple
baked highlighter by makeup revolution
this is so pretty I believe they just
got this in stock on Ulta it was hard to
find for a while but I'm taking my Sigma
fo three brush and just lightly tap this
and apply right on top of that liquid
once we have the eye makeup on this will
all come together I also like putting
down the liquid highlight first because
when you don't have any kind of product
on your face like a liquid foundation
powders on my skin at least tend to not
stay as well throughout the day we put a
liquid highlight down first you can even
put a like cream contour down if you
wanted to for your pottery products that
would help it stay a little bit better
throughout the day like I said really
feeling the glow so I'm going to town
things are just falling into every
eyeball right now so onto brows I
personally really like the look of more
bold brows with natural skin I've
permanent brows so I don't do a whole
lot to my brows any more especially when
I don't put on foundation I'm just going
to use my benefit precisely my brow
pencil and super lightly just kind of
shape them a tiny bit more brows really
help to frame your whole face so if
you're not doing a whole lot of makeup
on your skin I would still try playing
around with shaping your brows if you've
never failed in your brows before or
you're trying to figure out a good shape
just do it at night before you go to bed
that's what I used to do when I started
getting into makeup is literally just
play around at night because you can
just wash it off and then go to bed
to add a bit more of a brown
I'm going to go in with my ultra brow
gel I only put this on the outer half of
my eyebrow I like to keep the front
without it just so it's a little bit
lighter then I'm just going to comb
through these bad boys especially in the
front I like to go upward so then what
are we doing I shadow and grody onto
eyeshadow so I want to do a really warm
kind of smoky Brown eyeshadow look so
I'm use my Anastacio and modern
renaissance palette I love this things
let me start with the shade burnt orange
right here and then mix in a little bit
of golden ochre using a morphe 27 brush
and I'm just going to put that right
into the crease these eye shadows just
blend so easily so pigmented so great if
you want a drugstore option you can try
out the elf mad formats palette - some
kind I'm just going to be mixing a ton
of different brown shades from this
palette and go in with a mix of warm
taupe and Cypress Umbra this darker
brown shade kind of blending this on the
outer half of my eye like I said I want
it to be really smoky if you have blue
or green eyes lose tones are just going
to really help to make them pop because
we have some orange in there color wheel
opposites
I've Reza mentioned but this is also
really great if you have a lot of
freckles and you don't want to cover
them up but you still want the part to
be concealed where you might have acne
or discoloration or whatever if you just
go in and spot them feel rather than
putting a foundation all over your face
and your freckles can still come to the
party doesn't need to wake up right now
put that same brush I'm going to going
with raw Sienna right here and just put
that kind of on the first half of my eye
blending it into the deeper Brown shades
with that first brush I'm going to go
back in and just blend the edges out and
I might add a tiny bit more of golden
ochre just get a tiny bit more warmth in
the crease I'm going to go back in with
that bronzer and there we go so with the
lashes I'm going to use I don't feel
like I really need to do eyeliner if you
want to you could totally do wing or you
could just put on mascara without
falsies right now so I'm going to first
coat my lashes with some mascara and
then I'm going to put on the Pierces
medic's bombshell lashes I've been
working in love with the youth these are
bombshell right yeah they have the
perfect amount of intensity but they're
so with
so I'm going to pop these guys on and I
will be right back alright so falses are
on well my lashes are drying down I'm
just going to go in with a nude eyeliner
for my waterline this is going to help
make you look a little bit more awake
and bright this is a nude colored one if
you want super bright you could go in
with the white eyeliner so going back in
with the eyeshadow palette I'm going to
take my sit on the lace in 9:04 brush
and I'm gonna go in with a combo of
burnt orange and golden ochre again I'm
not going to bring this all the way in I
kind of want to just focus this on like
the outer half I want a super pop in
inner corner highlight so I'm gonna go
back in with that Maybelline strobing
liquid and just pop that right on the
inner corner then on top of that I'm
going to go in with the shade Vermeer
from this palette I'm actually going to
wet my brush I'm just using that same
setting spray you could just use water
mac fix+ whatever just because I want
this super intense there we go the last
step for the eyes I'm going to go onto
my bottom mascara wet-and-wild mega
length is my favorite it doesn't
transfer down so for lists I want
something super natural and almost like
I don't have a whole lot on so this is
the hourglass in Futurists I'm not going
to totally fill in my lips with this I
kind of just want to get the edges so
that they look a little bit bigger but
I'm not going for like a super polished
kind of lip look
using smell balm so this is almost the
same color as my real lip it just has a
little bit of Sheen to it since I have
lots of powders and everything on right
now I'm going to set my face I set my
face everyday anyways but this is the
urban decay nighter setting spray keep
in mind that my filming lights also
bounced back in my face in real life
doesn't look quite as glowy on like the
center of my face and stuff right so
this is the final look I hope you guys
