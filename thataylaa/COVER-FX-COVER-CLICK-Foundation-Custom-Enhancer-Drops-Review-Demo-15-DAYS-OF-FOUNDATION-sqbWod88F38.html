of coffee today by the way how freaking
amazing is this Cup feel like this is my
new child alright so it is day two of
fifteen days of foundation if you're new
here we're testing out a new foundation
every single day for 15 days I'm really
the 15 days playlist down below in case
you want to go watch all the other
reviews but today we're doing the cover
FX cover click cover stick creme
foundation as you can see it's super
freaking tiny this is the smallest stick
foundation that I own I lost the stick
foundations I'm going to be doing the
old testing found a ssin coming up in
the 15 days this one is brand new I
haven't heard anyone talk about this yet
I saw Tom's for website and I was super
intrigued so this retails for $18 it
obviously appears that you get less
product in this than you would in a
stick foundation like this I'm going to
break down the cost in a second so you
can see how it actually pans out the
idea with this is that there's kind of
three sticks in this collection looking
online there's the correct click so kind
of color correcting there's the enhanced
click and then the cover click so this
is the cover click this is supposed to
be like the foundation click kind of
ironic that they call a click because
this actually doesn't click and we'll
just winds up I didn't get the correct
click or the enhance click the correct
click is basically color correcting I
don't really believe in color correcting
I think it's kind of an unnecessary step
the enhance click is kind of like a
illuminator glowy thing depending on
your skin tone so we're just going to be
talking about the cover click but this
does come in that set of three for $44
this one alone retails for $18 let's
talk about the actual price you get zero
point two ounces of product in here just
for comparison in the Make Up For Ever
stick foundation you get 0.44 in the
maybelline fitme stick you get 0.32 and
then the old testify nation you get 0.25
so if you break it down if this stick
foundation was the same ounces as this
stick foundation this one would actually
be cheaper this would be thirty nine
dollars and sixty cents and this is
forty four dollars so even though this
one looks super tiny and like you're
kind of getting ripped off this is
actually a better deal than the Make Up
For Ever stick foundation cover effects
is usually amazing and having a wide
variety of different shades for
different skin
moans which I love there's 36 shades in
this whole click line but there's 24
shades in the cover Foundation I'm
insert screenshot of the shade breakdown
right here but the majority of the
shades fall in the neutral range I have
the shade and 10 you'll see how that
shade applies and looks on my skin in
the demo part of this video but I like
the shade I think it matches pretty well
so I want to do a shade comparison of
the custom cover drops if you have those
this is in the shade and 10 of the drops
and this is n 10 in the cover stick
foundation they both pretty neutral that
this one is definitely a shade to two
shades lighter so if the drops are too
dark for you this would probably work so
it's not a whole lot of claims about
this product but let's read what it does
say it says it's a foundation and
concealer in one for contouring
highlighting concealing and covering so
you technically could get different
shades of this if you wanted to use it
as like a cream contour and highlight
says this cult favorite I love how it's
a cult favorite but it's like brand new
offers ultimate blend ability and leaves
a finish that mimics the look of natural
skin paraben and sulfate free the
product is vegan says it's supposed to
be an ultra creamy stick version of
cover FX is best selling total cover
cream foundation so I have combination
skin with cystic acne I like more full
coverage foundations so you can't see my
acne also in this video we tried out the
custom enhancer drops show you guys
these are brand new from cover FX and
they're supposed to be amazing
so we shall see while you're watching if
you like this video and you're excited
about 15 days of foundation don't forget
to give it a thumbs up so I know if you
want to see how this foundation applies
and wears throughout the day we're going
to be checking in throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching
alright so I've already washed
moisturize primed my face as my shadow
multi solution gel I use that every day
it's really good face and also
moisturizes the face this is out to
party between day one and day two there
was a couple days in between since these
are a little bit pre-recorded so this
guy has come up there's some down here
I definitely breakout from the Too Faced
Born This Way Foundation I now know that
for a fact so I'm excited to try out
this guy look at qqs my roommate is
still asleep right now so I'm like
trying to be semi quiet I've the shade n
10 oh my god
this is so done this is the first time
I'm taking out of the thing this is like
the go tiny so this is nice for
traveling because you can either apply
this with your fingers a brush or sponge
I don't really like applying foundation
with my fingers so I'm going to go in
with a sponge on one side of my face and
brush on the other here brush for
applying cream foundations is usually
this elf brush I'll link it down below
but this is what I use with all my stick
foundations it works awesome I was
expecting a click not going to like let
see how far it goes so that's all the
product you get right there alright
let's do this so I think I'm gonna use
the whoa this is not as like smooth as I
thought kind of tugs on the skin as you
glide it on we're gonna go in first with
that and I'm going to go in with the
brush okay first thoughts already this
doesn't blend out nearly as easily as
the makeup forever stick foundation
which I did a full review on if you want
to see that yeah this is like way harder
to blend out I might try and prime the
side of my face to see if a primer helps
yeah we're going to do that and just
from this is looking like medium
coverage doesn't feel like anything
really to the side of the forehead yeah
this is way harder to blend out shade
wise the shade looks good once we have
blush bronzer and everything on it'll
look good it definitely is light so
that's nice here's the difference
between this
in this side still looking like medium
coverage just with that one layer I'm
going to add a primer this side of my
face to see if it'll help light it on so
I'm going to add a little bit of makeup
forever step 1 smoothing primer why am I
doing this is my loved and my fingers
are like gliding I'm going to set my
face so I hope the stick will do already
this feels like it's gliding on easier
I'm gonna use the brush on part of it
just so we can compare really quick and
then I'll do sponge for the rest yeah
okay blimps out way easier with that
smoothing primer on some use this sponge
now just to see the kind of coverage we
can give this definitely harder to blend
out with a sponge and I feel like it's
actually giving less coverage I
typically don't like sponges for cream
foundations
I think brush works the best even what
the primary doesn't feel like it glides
on as easy or blends out as easy as any
of the other stick foundations I have
shade wise I think I could have actually
gone a shade up this looks a little bit
light I know it'll look fine once I have
everything else on but right now it's
looking a tad ghostly which if you're
lighter than me then it's good as far as
how it's sitting on the skin it looks
really nice it doesn't look foundation
II it looks a little bit dry on my
forehead it's kind of clinging onto some
dry patches on my forehead but let's go
in for a second layer see how it builds
and see if we can get more coverage of
this I also feel like I'm having to
apply it quite a bit like I want to run
out of this in like a day okay so now
that I have a second layer on it looks
like a solid medium coverage I don't
think it's totally full coverage you can
still see some of my scarring peeking
through the zip showing through the
finish from here down looks pretty good
it just looks like skin from here up it
looks like it's clinging to some dry
stuff I'm going to show you
close up in a second it feels nice it
doesn't feel sticky or anything feels
like it sets pretty quick I think once I
apply a setting spray and powder the
texture up here will kind of chill out I
also got the cover FX custom enhancer
dropsies just basically live magical so
might as well apply these on camera too
so I'm going to do the concealer and
stuff really quick and then show you
guys how the drops apply okay so before
I set my face with the powder I'm going
to go in with these drops typically if
you're applying any kind of liquid
highlighter you want to apply it before
your powder you put a liquid on a powder
weird shit happens I do set matter eyes
first typically I'm not going to be
putting like highlighter under my
eyeballs this is what the bottom looks
like how freakin pretty I have the shade
celestial this was the lightest shade
I'm going to shake them up okay take
back what I just said I think I'm going
to powder my forehead and leave this
part without powder just because I feel
like this is the only part that really
needs powder up here so I'm gonna use
the cover effects illuminating setting
powder this is my only loose setting
powder I use it's the only one that
doesn't make my skin look super funky
and this is on my favorite setting
powders to use period that definitely
helped to settle some of the texture on
the forehead alright we're going in
so these are supposed to be like super
metallic e I'm going to swatch it really
quick just so I see how much to put on
my face
oh hell yeah
look at that Sheen um sign me up
alright this is beautiful put tiny bit
of this on my nose oh that's a lot
Macy's has a Heather or mix them in with
foundation Plainmoor because why not so
right now it is 9:26 in the morning I'm
going to apply the rest of my makeup and
we'll be right back
alright so there are some eye makeups on
it is now 953 a.m. I don't even remember
what it what time I said last time 920
925 who knows it looks really nice right
now I did have a little bit of trouble
blending my bronzer and blush on top of
it as far as how it overall looks it
looks really nice looks like a satin
matte finish nothing to doing not too
matte where I didn't apply powder down
here
feels nice it feels fully set so I'm
excited to see how this way start the
day
all right so it's 119 foundations been
on for about four hours now well let's
take a look well I think it looks
literally exactly the same as four hours
old and we applied it which is awesome
there's no creasing around my mouth
around the nose area looks really good
which is usually where my finish and
starts breaking down
looks like I'm starting to get a tiny
bit shiny on the forehead but nothing
major at all looks really nice looks
just as good as when I first applied it
I don't think I really have anything
else to report right now looks good
we'll check back at the end of the night
all right so it's now six eleven so the
Foundation's been on for about nine
hours got my green smoothie so looking
at my face now it looks pretty damn good
it definitely looks more dewy than it
did this morning which I actually like I
don't think it's to the point where it
looks super oily it looks a little bit
more reflective because of this light I
don't think it looks super oily I
actually like the way it's kind of worn
throughout the day and I actually like
it better now than I did when I first
applied it I don't think it really
oxidized at all my blush bronzer
highlight is still run around the nose
area it's breaking down a tiny bit but
nothing like what I normally get so it
actually looks pretty good
I have no smile lines so it's awesome
and overall I like it we'll definitely
be wearing this again if you're going to
get this just be aware that it really
doesn't blend out easy that's a major
downside to me the makeup rubber stick
foundation literally just glides on and
blends out and you can't even feel it
this one you definitely have to like
work into your skin and blend out the
primer did help a lot so I'll probably
be playing around with different primers
and seeing which one works best the
other small downside just for me is the
coverage I would like a tiny bit more
coverage
it definitely has less coverage than the
mega for everyone but it built up nicely
I still feel like I totally have enough
coverage right now and you can always go
in and add coverage with concealer but
uh yeah by the way I did change my lip
color from the beginning this is the
Kylie cosmetics Dolce K which looks so
much darker on me than everyone else so
