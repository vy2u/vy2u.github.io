days of foundation it was a polka dots
and flamingo mugs ten a day Cheers days
one through three are linked down below
the description box if you missed any
but today we're going to be talking
about a new product this is the cover
effect total cover cream foundation I
was really intrigued by this because it
says it's supposed to be a full coverage
concealer and foundation in one I have
cystic acne so I typically like to lean
towards more full Gummidge foundation
niches are the best they typically lean
towards more full coverage products so
looking on Sephora let's read some of
the claims this product comes in 40
shades which is incredible I always
appreciate cover effects and shade range
they pretty much have a shade for anyone
they have a really great shade system as
well if you look on the product page on
Sephora they kind of break it down for
you they have different undertones I
actually went with the shade g10 and the
cover effects pigment drops I'm in the
shade n 10 the description G Chen says
porcelain - light skin with golden
undertones don't ask me why I went with
this I'm regretting not going with n 10
and 10 says porcelain - light skin with
neutral undertones they actually also
have an n0
Simon cert swatches of this shade g10
compared to some of the other
foundations that I own right now alright
so swatch time right here is the cover
FX total cream foundation in the shade G
10 next over is the Maybelline Dream
matte mousse foundation of course on
ivory yesterday's video then we have
Laura Geller cover lock foundation the
shade porcelain which was day - Natasha
jeez nona foundation X in the shade 10
derma called 2:08 which is really good
shade match for me tart rain forces of C
in the shade porcelain Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless in 110 and pur
cosmetics bear doll foundation in the
shade porcelain so this project retails
for
kriem solid product to give you some
comparison that cosmetics confidence in
a compact foundation which I also have a
review on that retails for $38 and get
0.63 ounces of product because it's an
antioxidant rich cream foundation and
concealer in one that provides radiant
full coverage it contains 32% pigment
for long wearing full coverage loaded
with emollients and antioxidants radiant
second skin finish creamy ultra
blendable texture that has also made the
foundation a cult favorite for
contouring this is a new product so I'm
not entirely sure how this is a cult
favorite self-proclaimed cult favorite
it says is supposed to be for dried to
normal skin on the cover effects website
I have oily combination skin so I'm
really curious to see how this is going
to hold up throughout the day they keep
getting sidetracked by the tight light
so that's pretty much all the claims on
this foundation if you are excited for
15 days of foundation make sure to give
this video a thumbs up if you're new
here you can join the bay radio family
and subscribe there's a new foundation
first impression video every single day
for 15 days 6 p.m. Pacific time is when
the videos go live okay it is freaking
toasty in here right now I don't know
what's happening it's 9:15 in the
morning the ready wash and moisturize my
face and primed I use the Laura Mercier
foundation primer packaging on this
feels pretty cheap doesn't feel like a
very thick or sturdy plastic packaging I
mean this is like elephants you probably
snap this in half so in one side of my
face and we tried to Sigma f80 - this is
the round kabuki brush on the other side
I'm going to go in with my sponge feels
pretty stiff when you put it in feels
like it's dragging no idea how much
product that just picked up doesn't
smell like anything yeah it literally
has no scent I'm gonna need a bit more
that's a bit of a tug - it's not gliding
on like the makeup forever stick
foundation blends out but it doesn't
feel super hard to blend out I've gone
in about four times so far just one drag
down and once that amount we're getting
good coverage but it's not totally
covering my acne probably will set this
with the powder I do have some dry
patches on my forehead though and this
is sitting pretty nice on it's not
clinging anywhere it does look like you
can see brush strokes so afterwards I'm
going
go ahead and just smooth it out with a
sponge looking a bit luminous right now
so I'm gonna try sponge on the other
side and just go to town I don't usually
like sponges for cream products because
I feel like it kind of eats up the
product and that's kind of what's
happening here mmm okay let's try one
more yeah do not like a sponge apply
this I'm going to go back in with the
brush yeah way better covered with the
brush and the product just goes a lot
farther okay why does it feel like it's
a sauna in here the shade is a little
bit off I think I could have gone with
n10 looking a bit yellow but once I warm
up my face with blush and bronzer and
stuff I think it'll be fine at my chest
my chest definitely has more pink in it
than my face right now so I'm going to
go ahead and actually just use my finger
to try and spot conceal it does say this
is a foundation and concealer in one and
just focus on some of my more pigmented
spots oh man my scarring is still coming
through you can spot concealing on a
second layer it is building but it's not
total total cover I don't say this is
like dermal call kind of coverage but it
is full coverage just to smooth out
those brush strokes I'm going to go in
with a sponge there's nothing on this I
definitely feel like this is one that I
need to set my pores don't look majorly
emphasized or anything center of my
forehead looks pretty good there's a
little bit of texture not the smoothest
I've seen but it's not horrible I think
it's safe to call this high coverage you
have acne I don't think this is total
total full coverage doesn't feel like
it's really setting at all I wouldn't
want to blend bronzer and stuff on top
of here it just feels a little bit too
tacky so I'm going to apply the rest of
my makeup figure out which setting
powder I want to use and I will be right
back right now what is it right now it's
9:27 it's now 954 so we're gonna call
the check-in time 10 o'clock I don't
know there's something about this I'm
not totally loving I'm like sitting on
my trip right now the shade aside it
just kind of looks like an average
medium to high coverage Foundation to me
more this on my skin if you have asked
me it's just not totally covering it did
powder my face by the way use the cover
effects illuminating setting powder
because this one typically has more of a
pink tone to it so I thought it would
help to kind of neutralize out the
yellow
my forehead now with the powder does
look a bit dry but around my pores it
looks good it looks smooth everywhere
else I also feel like I have a lot of
makeup on right now I don't know I'm
just not very well by this at this point
maybe as one of those it gets better as
it wears throughout the day and kind of
warms up to your skin it's on the rest
of my face as a bronzer I used to cover
effects using a lot of cover effects
today sunkissed bronzer actually just
got this this is the second time I'm
using this if you guys recommend to this
in my hoola bronzer video and so far I'm
really liking it is a really nice tone
to it
blush I use this shade from the L'Oreal
infallible paint 230 blush highlight I
was throwing it back and used this shade
from the cover know from the a cosmetics
my soul to face palette which is
stunning I feel like this highlight is
totally underrated I tried out the new
morphe 35o palette on my eyes i use this
shade right here and then this shimmery
light shade on lid lately for mascara
has been layering the Too Faced better
than sex mascara with the Catrice glam &amp;amp;
doll mascara and I feel like this takes
it to the next level like a tree's one
on top just add some major length in
separation I've been in love with this
combo lips are also morphe used to
liquid lipstick in suspect so like I
said the check-in time is 10 o'clock the
next reckon I do will be in natural
lighting I'm really hoping I like this
more as the day goes on okay so right
now it is 3 o'clock so foundations and
on for 5 hours now and my thoughts are
pretty much the same there is a little
bit of oil coming through I feel like on
my forehead I'm starting to look a bit
dewy and around my nose so getting up
close there's a tiny bit of creasing
starting to happen around the nose area
it just looks kind of heavy around there
and it starting to crease on my upper
lip a little bit as well so are my
forehead doesn't look bad right now it
are like redoing my neighbor's flooring
right now so hopefully you guys can hear
that drilling when you get really up
close there is some almost pilling
happening down here you can see that
like separating already on my chin and
over here so I think my thoughts on this
are pretty much the same as when I first
put it on right now you know when you
just put a product on and for whatever
reason you're not into it that's how I
feel with this one I can't really put my
finger on what it is about this but I'm
just not
kind of want to wash off my face right
now but we're not gonna we're going to
keep this on I'll see you guys at the
end of the night now 741 and so the
Foundation's been on for almost ten
hours I've been like counting down the
minutes until I can wash my face if I
could sell this to two times now but I
really don't know what it is about this
I just feel like I have lot on
I am also pillow oily at this point now
and this was what setting it with a
powder we're getting real close to right
now
but as you can see very oily around my
nose area my pores don't look great
kicking it up around my upper lip around
my nose on both sides there's definitely
some separation on my forehead but the
separation isn't the major issue on the
forehead I just feel like I'm very oily
I'm thinking this one might be better
for dry skin so for me this one overall
is a pass even if you have dry skin I
don't know I think there are probably
better foundations out there for you
hopefully day was today day for
hopefully day five will be better so if
you guys like this video and you're
excited for tomorrow's video make sure
you give it a thumbs up
love you guys thanks for watching see
you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
