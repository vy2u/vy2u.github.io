all right so today is foundation Friday
today we're trying out a product that
I've been talking about for way too long
on snapchat today's a day we're actually
trying to sky out this is the covergirl
clean matte BB cream if you're new here
I do a foundation Friday every single
Friday I'm gonna leave the playlist down
below if you've missed any other videos
you can go check them out watch the
reviews so I feel like this is gonna be
a fairly short intro because I think
this product has the least amount of
claims I've ever seen looked on Ulta and
CoverGirl's website and literally all it
says is that it's an oil-free formula
that provides the perfect amount of
coverage to even skin tone hide
blemishes doesn't clog pores and it will
keep you shine free all day long so
that's pretty much it it has one fluid
ounce of product and this retails for
about eight dollars I did see at Walmart
it was like six ninety something I think
six ninety four at Walmart products
comes in six shades which I feel like is
pretty good for a BB cream auto BB
creams only come in like two or three
shades so the fact that they have that
six shades is a step up I guess from
usual I have the shade 510 fair which is
the lightest shade I'm going to do some
swatch comparisons right now so you can
see how this shade compares to some of
the other foundations that I own swatch
time right here is the covergirl BB
cream in 5/10
this is Urban Decay Naked skin
foundation in 0.5 Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless in 110 Tarte
reinforced with C in the lightest shade
so we're just going to jump into this
video because there's no other claims on
here if you're excited about foundation
Friday make sure you give this video a
thumbs up you can always let me know
down below what foundations you want to
see in the coming weeks foundation
Friday's super helpful for me let me
know what you guys want to see so if you
want to see how this BB cream applies
and where is throughout the day you're
in the right place just keep watching
okay it is 9:15 in the morning it's my
mom's birthday today happy birthday mama
day Rideau I'm actually filming this on
the 11th I filmed last week's foundation
Friday yesterday in my time so today
we're doing this week's foundation
Friday because I'm going to be out of
town for forever so I've already washed
my eyes pride of my face today use the
jouer aunt
I'm a primer and I'm going to be using a
brush on one side of my face and then a
sponge on the other side here it is
start the show we're going to shake this
up I've heard good things about this I
actually haven't watched any of the
review videos on this yet this was on
those products that I definitely would
not have picked up if it wasn't for you
guys and for YouTube since I do have
cystic acne I have a lot to cover up I
typically do need a little bit more
coverage than a BB cream but we're going
to see how this goes did a completely
share foundation in 15 days of
foundation so I think we can do anything
at this point
so I squeeze them out right there and
has a pretty thick formula I think we're
gonna start out with a brush on this
side of my face has a funny scent kind
of smells like sunscreen but not
actually covering pretty well for a BB
cream you just use that whole pump on
just this bottom half of my face so I'm
going to go squeeze some more obviously
if you have pretty good skins you'll
need less product it feels like it is 90
degrees in here with this light I'm
actually liking the shade it has a nice
kind of beige you shade not too orange
you not too pink
so that was one layer on this side I
actually think it covered pretty dang
well we got about medium coverage
somebody's a Real Techniques sponge on
the other side of my face and just dab
this for sure getting a lighter coverage
with the sponge so if you're not someone
who wants a ton of coverage you just
want to like quickly apply it you might
like to sponge so I'm gonna go in for a
second layer just on the spot so I feel
like we need it to see how much we can
build it up but just with that one layer
I'm actually pretty impressed with the
coverage now we have someone hammering
upstairs all right let's see if this is
buildable and make sure you let me know
down below what foundations you want to
see in upcoming foundation Friday videos
okay this is really nice with that
second layer it's matte but right now
it's more of a satin matte finish and
it's just like sitting on my face really
nicely for a matte foundation or matte
BB cream
it's building really nicely I feel like
we're getting a lot more coverage on the
second layer but it's not looking too
cakey or anything
blend that dub chin ladies really hoping
that this doesn't oxidize throughout the
day because it will definitely be too
dark if it does and covergirl face
products tend to majorly oxidize on my
skin I have tried the covergirl
three-in-one foundation a long time ago
and how know if it's just because the
color was like way too dark for me or
what but I could just never get it to
work for me and it majorly oxidized
throughout the day okay first thought I
am liking this I would say we got it to
about a high high medium coverage I
don't know it looks pretty good like we
got a pretty good high medium low full
coverage with that second layer all of
the redness and stuff that you saw
earlier in acne is totally covered up so
I guy has a really natural matte finish
it's not too like dull on the skin look
at the coverage for a BB cream I'm
impressed
so right now it's 9:30 I'm gonna apply
dress my makeup drink some major coffee
and I will be right back okay so it's
now 948 let's just call it 10:00 a.m.
rest of my makeup is on told myself I
was going to do something simple and
then this happened I'm feeling the Blues
lately so I am very impressed at this
point I didn't set this product at all
it's set fully in about 5 minutes my
face felt fully set I could easily blend
out blush bronzer highlight on top
nothing was clinging or dragging I just
love how it feels totally set on its own
and it is supposed to help control oil
and stuff throughout the day so I just
wanted to see how this performs on its
own without a powder I did set my face
like always today use the NYX dewy
finish this doesn't actually make the
finish dewy at least on my face it
doesn't but I use a setting spray every
single day so put it on today right now
I have zero complaints it's sitting
really nicely on my face it's not
clinging anywhere looks really good on
my forehead there are pretty much no
lines around my nose or upper lip right
now everything just looks very nice and
very matte but in a good way I usually
don't like super matte foundations but I
feel like this one has still that like
skin
kind of look to it on my lips I used la
splash smitten Lipton mousse in serious
it's like this dark blue matte liquid
lipstick and then I put open it k
pandemonium over top which is this like
super pretty intense purple then I
topped it off this is like quite the
combo with my Luke see Beauty highlight
in Luna this is actually phase highlight
mine is totally broken or else I'd open
it but this is the best lip topper it
literally just transforms any kind of
lip color especially with like a blue or
black or something just looks amazing so
ten o'clock I'm going to wear this
throughout the day and I will check back
and if you are alright so it's now seven
twenty two day has been a little rough
pretty much right after stopped filming
how to migraine all day but I just want
to wrap up this video so I wasn't able
to check in but the foundation isn't on
for nine hours and it looks bomb it
looks pretty much the same as when I
first applied it my only criticism is
that it's definitely oxidized it's not
looking as dark on camera as it does in
real life but it's for sure oxidize and
I don't know if it's just because I was
laying on the hot pack which usually
tends to mess up my makeup a little bit
but there's some parts that look a
little bit dry mostly like right here I
could have totally just been like
rubbing my face or something
everywhere else looks really good a few
oily skin this one pretty much totally
controlled my oil without any kind of
powder or anything if you have dry skin
don't think this is the product for you
just because it is oil controlling
Anne's more on the matte side might
extend a tiny bit of foundation mixer
next time just so when it does oxidize
it's not too dark with the two layers
like I did I feel like I got really
great coverage especially for a BB cream
so I am liking this one thumbs up for me
for this product I love you guys thanks
for watching see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
