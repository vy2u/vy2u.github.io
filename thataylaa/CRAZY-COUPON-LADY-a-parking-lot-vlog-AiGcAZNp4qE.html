found the trick to parking lot logs find
Center Bayou that gets business once a
year in parked there look at this
there's no one there's no one there's
one car why do people buy those smart
cars so I thought I would try car vlog
round to see how it goes
since it's Sunday I went to Dollar Tree
got some if you follow me on
Instagram you know that Dollar Tree has
Dollar Sunday newspapers so if you don't
get the newspaper it delivered to your
house but you still want the coupons
then you should go to Dollar Tree so
this is going to be like a car couponing
session oh I forgot scissors
alright so whenever I push it on
Instagram about coupon you guys always
ask to do a video or something on that
so I'm just gonna give you some quick
tips Oh score I got two smart savers and
one so I'm just gonna give you some
quick tips like how I coupon and how I
stack them there's a whole world of
couponing out there guys I used to
follow a like crazy coupon lady blog and
now I just kind of learned how to do it
on my own it's pretty easy she do it
alright so what I do is I start out with
PNG and smart source which are the two
ones with like manufacturer's coupons we
have my chair back skip it ends okay so
basically what I do is go through Red
Lobster basically I go through and just
cut out whichever ones I think I'll use
I usually cut out only make up coupons
unless it's like food there's one red
one one in here and it says save one
dollar on
beauty tools I'm probably not gonna use
axe I don't need any like tweezers or
 like that but if you didn't need
that what was falling then you would
look on cbs.com or write a calm look
under their weekly ad section and just
go through and see which brands are on
sale for example last week Revlon was
40% off so that would be a good time to
take advantage of the 40% off sale and
use this coupon to save an extra dollar
and then what I do is I stack the coupon
so I have a like manufacturer's coupon
at like $1 off Revlon or something like
that so if I have an extra
manufacturer's coupon from last week's
paper or something like that with
another Revlon coupon then I'll stack
that and all you have $2 off or whatever
it is and the sale from Rite Aid alright
so this is the stuff I use the Revlon
color silk or whatever is called that's
a good look there's almost always
coupons for this hair color so the thing
is what you do with couponing is you
don't buy it when you need it you buy it
when it's on sale before you need it so
when you actually run out of it you have
it in your house and you got it on sale
for cheap you got to think ahead people
you got to think ahead alright so now
I'm going through a PNG France amber
they have a lot of crest oh by the way
speaking of crest if you have a I still
even know what this piercing is
called if you have this piercing like I
do mine got like not infected but I went
to the dentist and there was like I like
gum tissue around it and I was like what
in the hell like I clean it out with
salt rinse or whatever I do everything
I'm supposed to so I went to the
piercing place and the first thing guy
said was do you use crest whitening
mouthwash and I was like yeah I used
crest whitening mouthwash
I guess that had like the whitening
ingredient in it is like harmful for
your lip piercing so basically don't use
it your lip will get infected so now I
have to find a different mouthwash to
use they have random
fun fact my battery's gonna die so this
vlog might be cut short target has some
good coupons they have if you want to
try the new Neutrogena shine control if
I could talk they have one dollar off
coupon for that I tried that stuff if
you phone me on Instagram you saw that I
was not too fan there's like rice
complex in it which makes sense because
rice soaks up water like but it feels
like you're putting sand paper and like
yogurt mixed on your face by like vlogs
because they're kind of like impromptu
videos where I can just mention random
things and doesn't have to be like
structured not that my videos are
structured anyways I don't know I can
just tell you guys what I'm thinking you
know what I mean you should see my car
right now after I just like mildly
coupons feel like now I need a
jack-in-the-box huge a soda with me like
you know what I mean
battery's about to die so I hope you
guys liked this quick vlog I don't even
know if those couponing tips were of any
help but I am probably going to be
making a whole other video about how to
coupon and how to coupon online do you
guys think coupon or coupon coupon I my
stop holler if you like vlogs thumbs up
if you like this video my eyeball is
twitching right now stop thumbs up if
you seriously around 25 thumbs up if you
