is 25 degrees out together right now
that I copy three choices if you're new
here foundation Fridays where I do a new
first impression video and every single
Friday on my channel I have an entire
foundation Friday and 50 news foundation
playlist down below as much I got more
foundation reviews they are always
linked down below in the description box
for razón business the foundation I
know the audio is not the best right now
you guys had a lot to say about it and
be 2016 favors video but I'm glad you're
liking the lighting and everything this
is new space this is only the second
video I'm filming in here and the space
is pretty big and there is an echo so I
am working on soundproofing the room
getting a different mic for getting like
a Psicosis lucky thing to put around the
mice that is coming I needed to fill
this video today so we're dealing with
the same mic that it was last time but
just know I'm working on it they're with
me while I figure out that and
everything it's a new space so there's
going to be some things to work out so
there's actually planning on filming the
new Nick drops foundation but I ordered
that a week and a half ago and a first
came out online and I still have not
received it it just shipped yesterday so
that will probably be next week's
foundation Friday but don't worry I have
an entire package of foundations over
there filter review people always asked
when when you went around the
foundations to review I don't think
that's possible people so one of you
guys actually commented on a video
saying to check out this foundation that
it was like totally underrated you had
heard anything about it on YouTube so
that is what I did this is the base
there Tilly a I think is our silicate
ultra foundation Pro and this is a
professional makeup artist line I have a
ton of sample sizes at different shades
and everything that I'm going to show
you guys since they do offer samples on
there for a dollar you give you a little
sample cups for $1 on the basically a
website I don't want to commit to a full
bottle just to make sense but the actual
bottle looks like this it's pretty tiny
you only get 0.68 food ounces of product
in it and it retails for $35 yeah
$36 so it looks like it comes in 12
shades as far as actual like Kleenex
shades but the neat thing about this is
that since it is a professional line you
have white mixers your parts that add
warmth to it if you have deeper skin
tone they have a darker shade and then
there's also a yellow shade if you need
to make your foundation a little bit
more yellow coming you pretty much make
your own shades customize it however you
need to so including all those shades
there are 17 total shades in this
product I ended up getting the shades
one and two just to see which one would
work best so I'm going to swatch all
these do some mixing see what happened
so start that right now okay so these
are all of these sample sizes that I got
right here's the shade one which almost
is a exact match for me right here is
the shade to next over is heat to the
shade blaze which is obviously a yellow
mixer this is a shade zero plus plus
which you could use to darken your
foundation if you have a deeper skin
tone and then this is zero - which is
obviously a white mixer to lighten your
foundation someone go ahead and mix the
shade one right here with this yellow
mixer so you can see how it works
the cubes mixing is adding a tiny tiny
bit and just add in really small
increments until you get the shape that
you want so here's a little bit of one
now I'm going to take a tiny tiny dab
with yellow literally that much and go
ahead and mix it in so as you can see on
my skin tone that's obviously too yellow
but for someone who has yellow
undertones in their skin this could be a
lifesaver
so I'm going to try to shade 0 - with 0
+ + + makes this a little bit and just
see just kind of curious kind of feel
like we're in painting class right now
this deep shade is very pigmented so you
just need a tiny bit what got some gray
okay so this is a good experiment let's
try and warm it up by adding some that
warmth in let's try a little bit of
blaze this actually just totally spilled
all over my carpet so awesome
as you can see that just totally took
away the grayish tone I'm adding a bit
more warmth just to see look at that so
ideas that you can just play around with
it get your perfect shade undertone and
everything which is amazing once you
play around with it you'll get an idea
of how much you need to mix of each
color to match you exactly so I talked a
lot about white mixers on my channel
mixing in white products with your
foundation to lighten it and I'm going
to have like a white mixer showdown kind
of thing coming
it takes a long time to try out all them
thoroughly before hackable video on it
and if you have probably 15 to 20
different white mixes of this place but
that is coming let me know down below if
your codes that I but I know the problem
also sits on the other end of the
spectrum where if you have a deeper skin
tone a lot of times I've heard that can
be just as difficult if not more
difficult to find foundation that
matches your skin tone as well the thing
is great since it has a zero plus bust
shades of dark near foundation
foundation Leitner's and dark nerds in
the professional world are not a new
concept but for brands and Sephora and
drugstores and everything these haven't
totally hit the market yet in the last
few years there has been a major
improvement and foundation Leitner's for
example in mix white mixer it's only a
matter of time before more kind of
mainstream brands come out with light
nerds and dark nerds so looking on the
base or Chile a website let's read some
of the claims or it's actually a lot of
info on this so get ready so so this is
an innovative approach to foundation
that allows you to be in control it's
highly pigmented long-lasting innovative
foundation that provides buildable
coverage with the natural size finish it
is a silicon based foundation because
it's sheer enough for younger women yet
to meet the needs of anyone that
requires more coverage do young women
not
it's an outstanding performer I mature
troubled or sensitive skin it is very
acne prone skin I have combinations
going to get pretty oily throughout the
day on the t-zone it forms a delicate
lightweight and flexible second skin
with natural breathing ability no primer
needed it does the primer is built into
the foundation because of its silicon
based formula and it sets without a
powder so this sounds like a freaking
miracle product right now yesmy moisture
heat and sebum resistance
I think check above my women a BOGO word
so as Moses are so cool that is all the
claims on that foundation if you guys
like foundation ready and you're excited
to watch this video make sure to give it
a thumbs up you always let me know down
below give any other kind of not talked
about Phoenicians you want reviews let
me know down below so if you want to be
how to be spacer Tilley a ultra
foundation pro my caramel blending
applied where it starts day you're in
the right place
just keep watching so this foundation
actually says that since it has silicone
in it you do not need a primer so we're
not using a primer today so I think
we're going to start out with the shade
one and see how this is so if you don't
want to buy the mixer as well you can
see if one will be light enough for you
I really do need to get back up to my
favorite foundation brushes to have here
so today i'm using the morphe ey7
i might use this one or I might use the
e54 since I don't have my normal
foundation brushes here and on the other
side of my face like usually would go
with my Real Techniques miracle
complexion sponge so that looks pretty
good
okay I'm showing of course on the throw
on the back of my palette and it is
supposed to be very pigmented so I'm
gonna start out with just about today
I'm Laura Chang thanks for one try this
brush
bris hopefully the white balance is okay
right now I can't tell the monitor is a
little bit off so I'm trying to like
guesstimate basically right now it is
9:20 in the morning by the way I'm just
going to stipple like I normally do onto
my brush OOP keep giving good coverage
and shade it was pretty dang good so
that amount covered half of my face
really well I don't think I got totally
full coverage at one layer looks about
medium coverage with a brush super
pretty dewy finish I'm going to try it
about the same amount on the other side
sponge okay some have a lot of money
Sean that's what I was going to apply is
pretty much identical with the brush and
sponge this one was a little bit just
quicker and easier to blend out to me
but both of them are looking really nice
I am pulling this down my neck but
looking at my chest I think this is
really good much yeah one layer of a
solid medium coverage looking really
nice on my skin it literally just kind
of melted into my skin doesn't look
foundation a towel supposed to be
buildable so let's go in and see if I
can get more coverage of it kind of like
the sponge butters at home you can use
this bun for a second layer on both
sides
heck yeah really Kokomo's because I'm
breaks me out because right now I'm like
annoyance look yeah this is building
really nicely there are still a couple
areas where it looks like some acne is
peeking through so it isn't totally
cover everything but with two layers
that is pretty close to full coverage so
on their website says it sets without
powder preserving the youthful duty
finish it has all focus properties that
diminish the look of fine lines and
wrinkles so you do not have to set this
with a powder so we are not going to set
it with powder today not settling in
anywhere it looks really good around my
nose right now and on my dry patches on
my forehead you literally can't even see
them so right now it is nine at 28 I'm
gonna do the rest on makeup and I'll be
right back alright so it is now 10
o'clock
I think clasping this Birkin necklace
took me off in the DNR's my makeup so
the foundation said I was paying about
15 minutes it actually took a while to
set before I felt like I said blend
brought their heavy thing on top but
once it did it everything blended up
totally fine the only thing I'm noticing
right now is that I'm scratching my face
not doing my mascara or something
because they have a line right here with
the foundation kind of wrinkled so I was
going to go in with my sponge see if we
can blend together that worked hoping
about my settle around my nose there
anything where I usually get creasing so
on the rest of my face two bras visa
Maybelline fit me powder in 310 Sun
beige this is quite warm but it works
for blush I use the SS mosaic blush and
all you need is pink highlight is la
draw strobe light strobing powder in 120
watt and this is pretty intense it looks
good on camera but in real life it's a
little bit glittery and it kind of like
emphasizes your texture eyeshadow a
totally puzzling surprises of pure
trolls palette it is brand new about
your cosmetics and this is not expecting
to like as much as I do you blend it up
really nicely they're super pigmented
I love the warm tones
sounds good mix of cool tone shades and
I feel like the Browns as they put in
here can go either way so if I can keep
playing around with this the gold is
like super pretty wet kind of gold
actually use a different mascara I know
this is the benefit roller lash mascara
mine's like totally dried out what else
lips Milani sweetie this is I think this
is one of their new shades of the more
matte lip cream a little bit Pinker than
I was expecting and then I topped it
with the wet and wild color icon lip
gloss in the shade jackieo lamode like I
said applying the second time at 9:30
sometimes when I finish out my
foundation and I didn't set the powder
like I said I did use my settings way to
serve risque all nighter setting spray
thing I'm working here for a few hours
but the next thing I do will probably
still be here the Sun is literally about
to be bright my face in a few seconds
the whole thing is filled with interim
push it back with you guys in a few
hours all right so it is now 3:05 so the
Foundation's been on for five and a half
hours still here but I'm sitting right
in front of the window right now so this
is all natural lighting right now I
think it's looking good come this shiny
in the center of my face right now I'm
hoping I'm not gonna look super oily by
the end of the night but this is without
a powder and it's starting to look a
little bit heavy around my nose area but
not bad when I was on computer I noticed
that I really can't feel anything on my
face right now
like when I touch it you can feel it
feels like a foundation when you touch
it but it doesn't feel like you're
wearing a heavy foundation it really
does feel breathable like I say so
here's a poster you can see I think it
just fits really nicely on the skin it's
really nice and smooth still I do have a
little bit of shine on my forehead it
doesn't look super super oily right now
but I like that my texture doesn't look
emphasized it doesn't seem to be majorly
settling into any lines yet my upper lip
a little bit but nothing horrible right
now I'm still liking it no major
complaints I will check back in with you
guys
tonight alright so it is 8:25
so the Foundation's been on for almost
exactly 11 hours this is long check-in
where's my mirror so I do look oily but
keeping in mind that I didn't set this
with the powder it has broken down a bit
around my nose and forehead but I've
definitely seen worse after 11 hours
actually notes that first starting to
kind of break down a little bit around
my nose when I left the office around
4:30 when that happened I was kind of
expecting this to just majorly go
downhill but it hasn't died a whole lot
worse since then I looked in a couple
different lighting situations and I
think it's oxidized right a shade itself
so two new breakouts popping up so I'm
really hoping it's not from this
foundation I'm turning down the lights
and getting really a post so hopefully
you guys can see I don't know if you can
see so it's breaking down a little bit
right here on my forehead and then
around my nose fair hopefully you can
see and I am very shiny I think if I set
this with the powder I'd probably be
good right now so next time I wear this
I'll be mixing in a little bit of the
white mixer and then I'll also set it
with the powder usually update you guys
on snapchat when I do kind of foundation
updates or if I've done it by the time
this video goes up I'll put it in the
description box but pros to this one for
me I really like to finish the first
probably six or seven hours I don't
think it got too oily until about that
point feels really lightweight I don't
really feel like I have anything on my
face it looks like skin kind of helps to
just like smooth out your texture if you
have super textured skin you might like
this it settles a little bit into some
lines so if you have mature skin I think
this might be one that you'll just have
to try out for yourself dry skin I think
this would be great for oily skin you'll
probably have to set it with a really
good mattifying powder overall I like it
I'm excited to play around a bit more
this the white shade is the same formula
as the foundation that I'm wearing right
now I'm really excited to mix that in
with other products because I do really
like the formula with this and just a
coverage and everything I love that you
can make this whatever you want it to be
shade wise and I do think coverage wise
by it's a small amount you get lighter
coverage I did two full on layers and I
did get it too
good coverage but if you're someone who
likes lighter coverage I think you can
also easily get a lighter coverage with
this so I hope this video was helpful
for you guys if it was make sure you
give it a thumbs up so I know love you
guys thanks for watching see you my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
