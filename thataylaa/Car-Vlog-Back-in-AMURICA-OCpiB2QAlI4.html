now it feels absolutely bizarre should
be feeling right now because happen
filmed in nine months as you guys know I
thought since I literally have no time
to film a formal video I would do
somewhat of a car vlog because I figured
that it's better than no video I'm
sitting in the rite-aid parking lot
because I have to return got the new BB
cream I'm not even saying anything about
Jordan I probably should um I'm back
from the Middle East after nine months I
surprised my parents and friends and I'm
home for two weeks and then I am going
back to Israel for the summer which I'm
really excited about I'm basically just
getting on a plane and hoping that I
find a job that's pretty much what my
life is right now and so I've been home
for two weeks doing Mexican food
everyday and like going to drugstores
and that's pretty much what I've been
doing for two weeks I don't realize how
much you missed the small things the
first thing I wanted to do after I got
off the plane besides get a burrito was
go to Target that's me I guess anyways
so I got this the Revlon Photoready BB
cream and I instagrammed a picture of
this so if you're not following my
Instagram then you shed it's the Tayla
and it sucks ass it's very oily and I
don't know it just doesn't do anything
for me so I'm returning it the lady
probably thinks I'm psycho and writed
because I have been going in like every
day and trying out new foundations and
returning them the next day you know we
know each other on a first-name basis
now and random thought my extensions
which I have been getting a lot of
questions about from I instagrammed it
but they are from totally blanking on
the name I'll put it in the down bar but
90% of sugar it's called hair secrets
let me know if you guys want to review
on these but I'm basically just trying
them out
for at least know probably like couple
months and then I might do reveal like
them so far they do shed is my only
criticism I have the hundred twenty
grams a twenty inch which they're very
long and they don't really blend unless
I wear ponytail so I think I'm gonna
bring them into my hairdresser and have
her trim them up so that they blend this
is probably a very boring blog vlog blog
I can't speak anymore but I figured it's
better than nothing quick deep moment
thank you guys very very much that's
awkward thank you for sticking with me
through these nine months hopefully in
Israel I will be able to put out videos
I think I will because I'll be in an
apartment and I'll be able to film and
everything like that
my arm is literally killing me right now
because I've been doing Jillian Michaels
30 day shred shout to Jillian which holy
 that is a good workout is no joke
alright what am i doing I was actually
alright maybe I should have like planned
out what I was gonna say first I'm in
America alright I think there's a time
to say bye because I'm literally just
saying I'm at this point and staring at
the field in front of me thumbs up if
you like this video thumbs up if you
want more vlogs that will obviously be
more entertaining next time you follow
my Instagram because that's really where
I update the most I think that's about
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
