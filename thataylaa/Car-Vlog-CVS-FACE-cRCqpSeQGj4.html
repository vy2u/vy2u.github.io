non normal way whatever it is Wednesday
it's my last day in America I know I
like just put out a video the other day
about my being back in America but time
flies when you're having fun I'm off to
Canada I was gonna mention it in the
last vlog and then I just cut it all out
but basically we just take a minute and
look at this nail polish I am freaking
obsessed with it it reminds me of a neon
guacamole I'm showing up true to color
on camera it's from the summer brights
collection by writing which is really
random and I thought I was gonna be
crappy but it's actually freaking
amazing and I'm obsessed with it it's
literally a sauna in this car and I'm
waiting for grandma to get a root canal
but yeah so I'm going to Canada tomorrow
I'm actually going to Toronto or Toronto
my boy friend like not officially but
pretty much lives there and so I'm going
there for the week to see him and I'm
very excited that's life right now
they're like a vlog in the weirdest
parking lots right now I'm in like a
dental center I went to CVS like I told
you I've literally all I do is like see
people and go to drugstores and eat
Mexican food so oh by the way if I loved
Tanner I got a spray tan yesterday and I
really like I just went to like one of
the normal tanning places and they had a
special for like an airbrush tan it's
usually $60 and I would never pay $60
for an airbrush tan so I got it I had a
coupon for 20 and you guys can like kind
of see the lighting isn't the greatest
but it's it looks good like it looks
natural I had to shower this morning
because I looked like I just came back
from like a year in the Bahamas and my
face didn't match my body at all
so I had to shower and like kind of rub
it a little bit but anyways so I went to
CVS and I got the Revlon Colorstay
foundation which is one of my favorite
foundations in 2:54
Paige and this is the one for oily skin
I have refill and in love with this
since I've been back but my shade is
like way too light the one I have right
now so I got this one and I figured if
it was too dark I would just be able to
mix the two shades because it's better
than like not having my face match my
body at all I could feel like right now
I basically just like use bronzer as my
powder because I didn't have a dark
enough foundation cool then I also just
got any I'll polish remover really like
I'm exciting but it matches my nails
kind of and this is just 96% acetone
which if you don't know the ones that
haven't like high levels of acetone are
the best don't get a stone free those
one second but they're probably like
better for you but whatever they don't
work so now I'm just sitting in a hot
car let me know if you guys are enjoying
these car blogs because I I don't know
my guy or whatever doesn't know about
YouTube my YouTube
yet and I don't know if I want to tell
him yet but anyways let me know if you
enjoy these vlogs and I will try and
keep doing them while I'm in Israel and
places what else is new I have to pee so
bad right now I know why I'm literally
sitting in a 90 degree car and I'm about
to pee my pants</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
