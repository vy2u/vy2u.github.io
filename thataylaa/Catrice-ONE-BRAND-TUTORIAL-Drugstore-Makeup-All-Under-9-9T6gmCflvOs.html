one brand tutorial this is a fullface
look using all Catrice products I wanted
to do something for Thanksgiving slash
the holidays that wasn't like a warm you
know I mean Instagram kind of look you
guys are seeing this I'm actually going
to be on my way to San Diego for
Thanksgiving I asked my mom if we could
have tacos instead of turkey this year
for Thanksgiving didn't go over well I
hope wherever you are you're spending
Thanksgiving with people you love and
care about let's jump into the look if
you have not heard of Catrice before
have used some of their products and
videos before and I also did a full
foundation video on they're all matte
plus foundation but they're European
brand that's now available in the US you
can find them at Ulta in stores and
online and literally everything I'm
using this video is under $9 which rocks
thank you to Catrice for collaborating
with me on this video for agreeing to
this collaboration I made sure that they
were okay with me telling my complete
honest thoughts with you guys and they
were so we are here if not I wouldn't
have agreed to this video so if I'm not
a fan of something I'll tell you if I
love it I'll also tell you like usual
just know that I got you guys Treece is
also hosting a friendsgiving giveaway
for you guys you can basically win a
bundle of Catrice products of all their
Instagram actress u.s. and their social

there all the info for the giveaway will
be down below in the description box if
you are new here you can join the BAE
Rito family and subscribe it'll notify
you every single time put up a new video
let's get into the makeup if you want to
see how I got this look you're in the
right place just keep watching I
actually figured out how to work the
white balance for once in my life that
wall is usually like blue let's do this
where's my coffee
so I have a few different primer options
here we have the Catrice prime and fine
pore refining anti-shine base
beautifying primer and the anti shine
blur stick which I'm super curious about
this is an actual like cream stick that
you can rub onto the areas where you
want to mattify so I think I'm actually
going to use the beautifying primer and
then put this on my t-zone I do want
more of a luminous look underneath my
foundation since the foundation I will
be going in with is super super matte
I've combination skin
get pretty oily throughout the day so
this has light reflecting pearl pigments
and vitamin E that's supposed to give
you a luminous glow
let's get glowy I was kind of a rose
Rosa and it definitely is glowy but it's
not like sliding around it still has
that sticky primer feel which I
personally like so I want my foundation
to stick to something has this peachy
color but it says it's supposed to fit
all skin tones says it can be worn alone
under or over makeup that's interesting
you're supposed to have a mattifying
blurring effect so I'm going to go in
over my pores and also on my t-zone and
then my chin and just blend that in okay
I want to show you guys this a closed
hoping you can see this on camera but
this is the side that I have filled in
my pores and this is a site that I
haven't blended in yet am I just seeing
things or does that actually do
something you can definitely still see
my pores but this did help to minimize
them now that we are nice and primed so
for foundation of going with a Catrice
all matte plus shine control makeup I
did a full first impression video on
this foundation during the last 15 years
of foundation series you miss that I'm
gonna leave that video down below if you
want to know my full thoughts on this
foundation totally good mattifying
foundation I just personally like a
little bit more dewy and this also is
too dark for me so if you're pale this
one isn't quite light enough so you do
have to mix in a mixer I'm going to be
just putting in a tiny bit of the
bodyshop shade adjusting drops that
recess and make a foundation mixer or
else I would just mix that in I'm just
mixing that on the back of my Bath and
Body Works palette that I use palette
candlelit that I use as a palette mixing
totally fine with this product so I'm
gonna use my sponge my Real Techniques
sponge to blend this guy in I probably
should have spot concealed first just to
get a little bit more coverage but it's
okay I'm gonna do that after okay with
that primer underneath right now it's
looking like more of a satin finish
which I really like with that one layer
got about medium coverage so I've the
liquid camouflage concealer here in the
review video I also tried out this
concealer I'm going to take the shade 10
porcelain a spot conceal and then use
the lighter shade underneath my eyes
I've never used this two spot conceal so
we'll see
well it covers I kind of just put this
on any areas that I need a little bit
more coverage like scarring and acne and
fun things like that okay I seriously
heavens it like in my double chin right
now what the heck so for under-eye
concealer I'm going to go with that same
liquid camouflage high coverage
concealer in the shade zero zero five
light natural this is the lightest shade
what is pretty light a little bit more
yellowy peachy tone like I haven't tried
this concealer enough to know my full
thoughts on it but you'll see how it
wears right now I'm just gonna blend
that out with my morphe g 38 I love this
brush for under eye concealer it's bomb
my under eyes have been pretty funky
lately I think they're just super dry
right now I feel like I don't get a ton
of coverage from this concealer but it
could just be not light enough for me
and you just set my under eyes and I
don't have a powder here so I'm just
going to go in with my normal setting
powder that I use underneath my eyes now
that we're looking a little more awake
so set my face I have this priming fine
mattifying waterproof powder this is
transparent so it's just like a
transparent press setting powder okay
this actually has a little bit of color
and is actually kind of light which is
nice ooh my face feels very soft right
now it feels like I don't have any
makeup on right now like it's super soft
get a powder in my eyeballs I'm gonna go
in for brows what do we have here I
think I have a few different brow
products I have this eyebrow stylus it
just looks like a brow pencil pretty
standard it has a little comb thing on
the end I also have the long lasting
brow definer whoo this is like a pen I
think I'm gonna go in with the pencil
I've kind of switched over to using brow
pencils lately instead of like a gel or
pomade and I'm not just been liking it I
feel like I have more control a little
bit this is in the shade 20 date with
Ashton I just had a flashback to like
middle school having a giant-ass crush
and Ashton Kutcher like I haven't heard
anything about good old Ashton in a
while I think that shade is actually
pretty spot-on for me it's like an ashy
brown shade
I've been into carving out my brows
lately so I'm going to take that same
concealer 0:05 and attempt to carve out
my brows a little bit I usually only go
on the underneath part of my brow
because I feel like it looks a little
bit more natural the brows are on folks
I'm going to use oh there's an eyebrow
set here to it you see that oh you know
what
maybe we'll try using this as a contour
oh this almost looks too ashy
could work though maybe let's try we're
either gonna have a great face or a good
contour actually before you go in the
contour I was going to prime my eyes
really quick using the prime and fine
brightening eyeshadow base I've actually
tried this I think in a video I use this
and a shadow and schmooze or something
and this is one of those primers that I
feel like you kind of have to Pat in
instead of blend or else it'll take off
any concealer on your lids if you have
any I like that it has a little bit of
white tint to it because it just helps
your eyeshadow pop a little bit if you
put on some kind of lighter base does
set pretty quick like this isn't one of
those primers that feel sticky this one
is actually setting the shade right here
in the chocolate and nudes palette I
think could also work looks like it has
a tiny bit oh that one looks so nice I'm
try this for the contour I'm taking my
e48 buy more for you just because this
has a little tapered end so I can easily
get in this shadow right here oh heck
yeah like this is a perfect natural
contour shade not too dark and not too
grey yeah this is actually a bomb shade
for contour I like to kind of Pat on the
product before I go in and blend just so
I'm not blending away any of my
foundation or coverage so I have this
Sun glow matte bronzing powder in two
different shades the medium shade and
the darker skin shade that's what it
says medium skin darker skin and use the
medium brown shade before the texture of
these are really nice blend out super
easily but the shade at least a medium
brown shade on my skintone looks a
little bit orange II so I'm actually
going to try the darker skin one just
because it looks a little bit more
reddish
no we'll see so I'm just going to use a
little bit of this on my wet and wild
brush bring this up to the temples a
little bit I think I actually like this
shade better on my skintone this blends
out really easily if you followed me on
snapchat was in New York I wore this
bronzer and the other shade pretty much
every day with this product which I
should also show you this is the ashy
radiance contouring palette this is bomb
if you have pale skin I am still doing
the contour shades for pale skin video
but I bought this because a bunch of you
guys recommended this shade this contour
product is amazeballs I use that contour
product in the bronzing powder and the
other shade pretty much the entire New
York trip blush I'm going to take the
Lybian rose illuminating blush I think
I've also used this in a video actually
gonna put a tiny bit of this on my nose
just to make my face look a little bit
more natural I think I've used this in a
video too this is the Jon Snow's
favorite eyeshadow but I've actually
used this as a highlight before I think
I'm going to mix it in with this Catrice
highlighting powder in champagne
campaign actually I might mix it with
this I've never used this highlight
before this is the highlight that comes
in the bronzing or the contouring
palette I think I'm going to mix these
two highlight shades right here and see
what happens
oh heck yeah I love using eyeshadows as
highlights the thing you want to look
for is like a super soft kind of buttery
texture which is what these glam fusion
eyeshadows have they feel almost like
gel or like a cream shadow a little bit
I do not like using glittery shadows as
highlights I usually only do it if it's
something that has this kind of texture
I'm going to take a little bit of just
this shade and put it on the Haiku this
highlight it's pretty I'm just putting
it right on kind of I don't know above
my brows just to give my face a little
bit more glow okay so my eye primer has
totally set which is great and I think I
want to do kind of a cool toned look
because I feel like most Thanksgiving
tutorials are always like warm whatever
so I think we're actually going to do a
little bit more of a cool toned holiday
II look so three different eyeshadow
palettes here and then I also have some
of their
not lose single shadows the liquid metal
shadow where you gun the liquid metal
shadows and the fusion glam fusion
eyeshadows I like the glam fusion
eyeshadows a lot better again they have
like that creamy kind of texture start
I'm actually going to take this contour
shade from the palette to put my crease
and not take my highlight brush let's
take a blending brush I love using the
same shade that you use to contour in
your crease it's just super quick and
easy and jump to like reach for another
product this glow right now is so
intense and I'm so feeling it I think I
might actually add some purple I feel
like that'll make it look pretty fold
don't take this darkest shade from the
absolute rose palette I've never tried
these eyeshadow palettes before I'm just
blending this into the outer corner of
my eye I don't know if it's the primer
underneath or these eyeshadows but this
is blending out really easily this is
actually pretty pigmented and it's not
like blending away I think I'm going to
use that same glam fusion eyeshadow and
John snows favorite and what my brush
and then go in and put this on the lid
you can use water you can use any kind
of setting spray to do this and I
usually cover my brush in product first
and then go ahead and spray it just so
it doesn't change the texture of that
eyeshadow in the pan and you can see
this is like very cream almost it just
made an indent in there whoops and then
I just dug my nail in it actually since
this is like a cream I don't think you
really need to wet it I'm just going to
use my finger yeah okay you get way
better payoff with your finger super
pretty I'm kind of going for like an icy
look you know saying and bring this on
to the inner corner a little bit the
lower lash line I'm going to go back in
with the contour shade that we use in
the crease and just blend this down
there to smoke that out a little bit
more I'm going to go back in with that
dark shade and just put this on the very
outer like half basically think we're
onto eyeliner I have an liquid eyeliner
here says it's waterproof and is
a matte powder liner well that that is
interesting I feel like this would be
good for smudging boo maybe will smudge
I cannot remember if I've tried this or
not oh it has a really fine point okay I
kind of want to try this this is the
liquid liner waterproof and don't leave
me ten just black shade all right
let's pray to the eyeliner guides
okay not bad you guys at all I just got
a super fine point really quickly whoops
that one got a little vertical okay I'm
excited to use this again because that
took like two seconds and super easy to
get a wing because the point of this is
super super tiny yeah I'm into this a
few different mascara options here
luxury lush lock washes glam and dull
and lashes to kill someone else
totally judged mascara by its bottle
like this one just speaks to me on
multiple levels this has a curved one
with super tiny rubber bristles oh this
one looks like is that my alley this is
a bigger one this is the luxury lashes
dramatic volume am I going with this one
I think I am going to apply falsies
today but we'll go in with mascara first
I feel like this is more lengthening
than volumizing I don't have any Catrice
lashes so I'm going to go into my Cara
s4 I freaking love these lashes these
are a dollar
okay so lashes are on scarf is on bottom
lashes I use the Catrice glamour doll
mascara and I really like this it's like
super almost Twiggy lashes debating
doing a nude lip or I kind of want to do
a berry lip I have a few different
options I'm going to swatch for you guys
okay here are the different swatches I'm
definitely going to go in with this last
shade on the end right here cuz that's
like the most very toned one but this
right here is the luminous lips 170 this
is the ultimate stay don't worry be
berry next to it that middle shade and
then the one I'm going to go in with is
the ultimate stay zero seven zero plum
and what does this say plum in base plum
and base I think one of those smelled
really good it smelled like a matte
lipstick first I'm going with the
ultimate stay lip liner in the shade
love me the way you plum this is like a
retractable turn up turn up I like that
this is one that you can go over and it
doesn't get all weird and bunchy or
anything if you mess up a line or need
to go over it you can totally do that
and didn't drag anywhere you're nice and
smooth
but these are like a perfect match do
you smell so good I think I'm actually
going to top this off with one of the
volumizing lip boosters cuz I want it a
little bit less fuchsia and a little bit
more ma be so we'll see if this helps
this is nuts about Mary
oh it says this contains menthol so
supposed to have like a cooling effect I
love anything a mental mint mental minty
or mentally okay so this is the final
look I hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you did make sure you give it a
thumbs up so I know all the products I
use will be linked down below I'm going
to do like a top 5
what I recommend from this whole thing
definitely the Catrice contouring
palette like I said I've used this
before I love this the eyeshadow primer
I don't know if it was the eyeshadows or
this but they blend it out super easily
and I feel like when I use my Mac Paint
Pot you can kind of see it it's going to
sound weird but you can kind of see the
texture of your eyeshadows a little bit
better does that make sense like I feel
like the primer is actually making them
stick and kind of pop and I feel like
you get the same effect with this which
I really like so I'm definitely gonna
keep using this
I am very pleasantly surprised by the
liquid eyeliner definitely going to keep
continuing to use this it's not super
matte so if you like a matte liquid
liner you probably wouldn't like this
because it does have a little bit of
shine to it but I don't mind that and
the brush on this is just really easy to
flick and get that tiny winged glam
fusion eyeshadows super pretty
definitely use your finger when you
apply this you can also use it as a
highlight if you're fair the highlight
combo used today I really like if you
want more of like an intense highlight
if you want more of a toned down one
just go ahead and use the highlight in
this palette fifth product I would say
actually really like the shade of this
and texture of this one I think this
could work for a bunch of different skin
tones in 0 to 0 deep bronze when you
first put it on it looks super pigmented
and it looks like you're not gonna be
able to blend it and then when you
actually blend it just kind of like
effortlessly blends out so I would say
these are like my top 5 don't forget to
