KitKat bar more than a bar of gold
alright so today we're going to be
talking about a total impulse by the
Charlotte Tilbury bar of gold skin
gilding highlighter instagram made me do
it couldn't resist the packaging this is
just going to be a little mini review on
this product a lot of people on
instagram said they wanted to see a
review on this so I'm just going to tell
you guys my thoughts I did do a little
demo in this video so you can see how it
applies on the face and I also have a
full video on the rest of my makeup
right now so link that down below it was
the comparison video of the Naked
palette smokey thing and the reveal
smokey palette so when I was looking
online just to find out some information
on this I think the show that Tilbury
released this a year ago for the
holidays I think it was only in the UK
this year she released it in the u.s. so
it was available on Nordstrom's for $42
which is fricking pricey for a tiniest
highlight it's a limited edition I think
it's only going to be around for the
holiday season I'm not sure when I just
looked right now it was sold out on
Nordstrom but I'm not sure you can
probably find it on like eBay or
something if you really want it I have
never tried anything from Charlotte
Tilbury before this my first product
from their line and like I said what
drew me into this was the packaging when
I actually opened this I thought that
this was an outer box holding the actual
product so I actually tried to use
scissors and cut this cardboard right
here no this is actually the product it
is in a cardboard box which for $42 I
was honestly shocked I feel like you
would have better packaging at the
drugstore this was just so surprising to
me so I do have scissor marks right here
because that's why I tried to open it
even right here you can already see
we're starting to happen on the corners
of the box just from opening and closing
it the actual product is beautiful I
love the fine gold imprint in it I love
how it looks in it photographs really
well but yeah I'm just shocked you'll
see in the demo but I actually I don't
even know today anything I was opening
it and the actual product fell out so as
you can see it's not even glued in
anymore
um okay just want to take a close-up and
the entire thing literally just fell out
of the packaging how much was this I
don't know if I can like crazy
this or what I should do but it's
literally just sitting in this cardboard
copper box after this happened to me I
went online and looked up reviews it's
happened to a bunch of people so it's
just really really poorly packaged in my
opinion I think they easily could have
made this like a nice metal packaging it
is only a 0.1 nine ounces of product so
there isn't a whole lot of product but a
little bit goes a long way but just for
the price for $42 you do get a tiny
product and pretty cheap packaging
moving on to the actual product it's a
lot lighter gold than I was expecting
which I am super happy about if you have
pale skin it totally works on your skin
tone you can see it right here it
actually looks a lot lighter and whiter
than I thought it was going to so it
looks like a nice champagne gold right
there
and when you swatch it it gives a really
nice Sheen to the skin it doesn't feel
chalky but it doesn't feel super smooth
I do like the actual product I don't
think I would pay $42 for this if I knew
it came in cardboard packaging that
being said I feel like I would only
recommend you pick this up if you're
into limited-edition makeup or
collecting stuff if you guys like this
