Charlotte gotta love ya alright so today
we have first impression video on a
Charlotte Tilbury magic foundation I
feel like I haven't done a first
impression in forever I've been hearing
a lot about this foundation lately so I
wanted to give it a go all the reviews
that I've seen are on people with pretty
dang good skin I've cystic acne so a lot
of the foundations that look like full
coverage on someone else may look like
light coverage if you have acne so you
get one fluid ounce of product in here
which is pretty standard for foundation
and it retails for $44 so I ordered mine
off of Nordstrom it says there are 15
different shades and I got the lightest
shade which is one fair eye Charlotte
Tilbury website there's a pretty good
foundation finder so you can see your
undertone and see which shade will be
right for you shade one says natural
base shade for very fair skin tones with
cool undertones and I feel like the
shade of this is actually perfect for my
skin really dig in the shade of it if
you're a pale princess with a similar
skin tone to me the shade will be light
enough for you and you have a full pale
skin playlist that a link down below
with all my foundation reviews and
things for pale skin anyways let's get
onto the claim so this is a full
coverage Demi matte long lasting
foundation enriched with hyaluronic acid
mushroom extract that does not sound
very feeling to me and concentrated
power of vitamin C so basically
Charlotte was like chillin making this
foundation for five years you hold the
magic foundation because it's basically
it supposed to be a foundation for all
ages all skin types all skin tones is
supposed to work for anybody and give
you a flawless kind of look it has SPF
15 in it which I really like and the
applicator is a pump so let's just get
into it you guys are going to see how it
applies and wears throughout the day if
you guys like first impressions videos
and you want to see more give this video
a thumbs up and let me know down below
what foundation you want to see next if
you want to see my thoughts on the
Charlotte Tilbury magic foundation you
are in the right place just keep
watching all right so I've already
washed moisturized and priming my face
today I use the ultimate in prime this
is one of my favorite primer is just a
nice smoothing primer whew feel like I
need more caffeine right now alright so
I have the Charlotte Tilbury magic
foundation right here look at this
packaging so freaking pretty it's a
blast bottle which feels like
yes but not the best for traveling and
I'm going to give this a shake
doesn't sound super liquidy or anything
and I haven't opened this at all I don't
even know what kind of oh wait that
doesn't look great okay so there's a
pump you take this top off and there is
a pump that's exciting ooh the shade
looks like it could be really nice
pretty neutral doesn't want to yellow or
too pink it has a pretty thick
consistency it's not running at all so
I'm just going to take my finger and
first dab a little bit and then I'm
going to go in with a brush on one side
and then a makeup sponge on the other
side this is the morphe 31 one of my
favorite foundation brushes I do have a
10% off code for this if you're
interested so I'm just gonna go and
start to apply this bad boy so this is
supposed to be full coverage and she
says to apply a generous amount if I say
she like Charlotte Charlotte and I were
talking earlier I obviously have cystic
acne so we've got a lot to cover up I
feel like that just set really fat whoa
yeah that's set really fast like super
fast I feel like I put quite a bit on
and I definitely didn't get full
coverage you can still see redness
freckles covered up obviously some of
the acne but it definitely doesn't look
like a full-coverage flawless
application let's apply some to the
forehead it feels kind of like a gel
when you apply it it feels similar to
the I think it was Rimmel the 24-hour
foundation or whatever the one I really
like I do feel like it's sitting a
little funky on my forehead you
definitely see the foundation on my
forehead ton of textures coming through
the shade I feel like is perfect and I
have blush on and stuff this will be
perfect I really like the shade so now
on the other side we're going to go in
with a makeup sponge I'm putting another
pump on the back of here and this is the
pure cosmetic sponge I love this because
it has a flat side right here this is
super nice sponge and I do it sell this
by itself I could just sit here and like
squeezes Alden go in okay already
getting way less coverage yeah
not getting nearly as much coverage with
this one
I add a little bit more and see okay I'm
going to ixnay this bunch because that
is just not enough coverage I'm going to
try the Sigma f80 too instead this is a
round top kabuki brush one of my
favourite foundation brushes and I just
did a whole video on my favourite makeup
brushes so I will link that below if you
missed it but this one usually gives me
pretty good coverage that's definitely
more coverage but for some reason I feel
like this side looks a little bit better
okay first impressions I would not call
this full coverage I think this is a
medium coverage foundation I am going to
go in for a second layer to see if we
can maybe it's buildable to full
coverage right now I don't think it
looks like revolutionary or anything it
is sitting pretty funky on my forehead
this side of my cheek looks pretty good
so I'm going to go back in with the
morphe brush and put a little bit more
on so sponge is really helping to make
the forehead look better I feel like it
takes away some of the texture and like
excess product then you guys in so you
can see what I'm seeing I'm kind of
indifferent right now I think it kind of
just looks like a standard medium
coverage foundation still wouldn't call
it full coverage you can still see
redness and some acne and stuff showing
through and just the texture like the
way it sits on my skin you can see my to
Zips peeking through right here if you
like this might be one of those
foundations that looks better as the day
goes on hope so because I'm not totally
thrilled with it right now so I'm going
to apply the rest of my makeup and then
we will be right back alright so the
rest of my makeup is on I did set my
face with the cover effects setting
powder because they use this every
single day you like using a setting
powder is totally personal preference
for me since I've been using it every
day I feel like it's a good comparison
it doesn't look that great as far as the
finish before I use the setting powder
it was about a sad matte finish
definitely more on the matte side this
isn't like a glowy foundation at all so
it's no 1248 p.m. so this is kind of a
late first impression I was working this
morning and I'm just
getting around to filming Emily this on
as long as I can and check-in throughout
today so you guys can see how it wears
and if it looks better or if it looks
worse throughout the day by the way on
my lips right now is the kathleenlights
Miami fever by Ofra I freaking love this
color and then on my eyes is the Shan
EXO palette just random mix of a few of
these shades I think I'm going to do a
whole video using the Shan EXO palette
so let me know if you guys want to see
that down below so I'm just going to run
some errands go grocery shopping do work
and I'll check back in a bit so it is
now 406 p.m. so it's been on for about
three hours now last night I was reading
all the health benefits about being a
vegan runner 2 juicer online Amazon at
2:00 a.m. and today we got KFC so let's
check out this foundation situation a
little bit of creasing around my nose as
far as I can tell the rest of it still
looks pretty good it looks about the
same not really getting oily nope feels
good so far I do really like the color
of it I feel like the shade is perfect
but I just feel like I'm wearing a lot
probably because I am I'd like layered
on this contour this is the makeup geek
on door it looks really muddy now if I
just put too much on or what but it
definitely looks a little bit muddy
alright so it is now 8 o'clock p.m. and
I feel like in the last few hours it has
gotten like significantly oilier I want
to show you guys under this light and
then also go into the ring light so you
can see but I just don't think it's
looking too great my forehead looks
super shiny and gathers oil coming off
around my nose it's like totally broken
up it just doesn't look that good
alright so I just turn on the ring light
so you guys can see but super oily I've
only had this on for about 7 hours so I
can't even imagine how this would look
in a few more hours if it's already this
oily I don't have overly oily skin I've
pretty normal to combo skin usual get a
little bit around my nose area and tiny
bit on my forehead but nothing like this
shouldn't look like this after 7 hours
so that's just my thoughts on this I'll
try a different setting powder and I'm
also going to try mixing it in with
different foundations I do really like
the color that's like my one positive of
this
that I really like the shade of it I
think the shade is super nice really
appreciate that thank you Charlotte
gotta love you but for my skin type in
the amount of coverage I need I don't
think that I will be keeping this I'll
probably be returning this foundation I
have seen reviews that of other people
that absolutely love this foundation it
works really well for them so maybe try
and get a sample of it from Nordstrom's
if you can and see how you like it for
yourself so if this video is helpful for
you guys give it a thumbs up so I know
