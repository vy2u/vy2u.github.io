on the floor right now
keeping it classy alright so today we
have a shadow and shmoo style classic
makeup tutorial if you're new to my
channel don't know what shadow and
schmooze are it's basically where we put
stuff on our face and talk about life so
all the products I'm using this video
are either drugstore or are super
affordable when firm or matte foundation
kind of look today so if you don't like
all the dewy skin stuff this one's for
you this is a super quick and easy look
that looks a lot more intense and it
actually is literally the only hard part
about this it's applying false lashes
which you can skip if you're not feeling
it so I hope you guys like this if you
want to see how I got this look you're
in the right place just keep watching my
tripod just broke so my camera is
literally just balancing on a stick
right now for a little crooked that's
why all of the makeup that we're going
to be using today is super affordable
you can get it at the drugstore or
online I'm starting out with Foundation
and I'm going to be mixing Revlon
Colorstay with this noni creme creme
color prevails you can get this at
Walgreens Revlon Colorstay the finish by
itself it's a little bit too matte so
I'm just going to mix it in with this to
give it some more like satin finish I'm
just mixing this with my finger on the
back of a palette love this they are
super dirty and I've already washed
primed moisturized all that good stuff
today for primer I use the LA girl Pro
prep primer and I'm like bending down
right now so I'm in the frame is just
Neal does that work that's what's
happening I'm just gonna dab this all
over my face maybe we should get a hair
clip I'm going to take my favorite Sigma
f80 foundation brush the no need cream
foundation on its own is actually not
that bad I wasn't expecting much from it
just because the packaging is so
freaking hideous like I was straight-up
judging a book by it's cover but the
packaging on that line is hideous do you
guys know what I'm talking about that
foundation is too dark on its own for me
so I do have to mix it in with something
if they came out with a pale shade I'll
probably wear it so it's the weekend
right now it's a Saturday and I'm pre
filming three videos today for you guys
I'm gonna be out of town for a week for
work I'm going to Chicago Boston and
then Ohio to visit a friend I'm super
excited I've only been to Boston one
time and I've never been to Chicago or
Ohio so basically this whole weekend I'm
going to be
filming and editing to get those ready
and then I leave like 4 a.m. Monday so
yay I was going to go over any places we
need a little bit more coverage I talked
about this in I think my last video but
my skin has been breaking out horribly
right now because I started using the
Clarisonic tons of you guys have told me
that just keep using it and that's just
a purge phase other people say to stop
using it immediately because it's not
your skin purging it's your skin
freaking out and getting irritated I
have decided to stop using clear sonic
just because my skin has been perfect
for months so why it up now before
I start using Clarisonic my skin was
completely clear like didn't have a zit
for months I made my how I got rid of
acne video and now it's back I'm just
not feeling like I need to do something
to mess up my skin right now even if
it's like a temporary thing so I think
I'll be returning the Clarisonic to Ulta
and when take the Maybelline fit me
concealer for the under eyes I've been
really liking this it's a little bit too
dark for my skin tone so if you have
pale skin this will probably be
borderline too dark but I can make it
work with my Physicians Formula powder
over top what weird I just got my nails
done
I took the acrylics off and it feels so
sure I can actually get in my eyeball
and a nice chill on the floor what else
is new in life I'm gonna be having a few
Halloween makeup tutorials coming up I
just did some major Halloween shopping
on Amazon I'm going through this thing
right now where I am feeling very
inspired I guess that sounds cheesy like
to make videos I always am but I feel
extra I don't know I just want to sit
down and film like 24/7 but yeah if I
wasn't working full time right now I
would definitely be cranking out the
Halloween videos just at the under eye
we're going to take Physicians Formula
correcting powder like always and this
just helps to lighten it up if you have
pale skin and set your under eye
concealer think I want a little bit more
of a matte beige today I don't know why
I'm just feeling it so we're going to go
with the Maybelline fit me powder after
grab it I'm going to take the matte and
poreless powder in the shade 110 and
just applying this with the giant
cosmetics powder brush for some reason I
think a classic makeup I think of like a
more matte dull light kind of face but
if you like dewy skin or if you have dry
skin
definitely don't feel the need to powder
okay what are we doing
I'm going with my favorite brow Jill
there's the word just gonna run this
through this is by Ulta brand and it's
just amazing lasts all day fills in your
brows if you don't want more shape to
your brows you could literally just use
this and you're good
well that's drying I usually like to go
in with my contour I'm gonna take the
Ulta brand contour kit and it's
definitely more of like a bronzer kit
none of these shades are really cool
tone but we're going to bronze up the
face of hang a bit with the shade warmth
bronzer just gives the cheekbones a
little bit of definition what's new with
you guys has school how's work how's
life let me know down below I'm thinking
about doing like a periscope thing okay
so for blush and highlight I'm going to
be using the Physicians Formula shimmer
brick I used to use this all the time
and I just found it chilling at the
bottom of my drawer so we're gonna go
back with this this thing is amazing you
could do a whole face I look with this
you can use it as an eyeshadow or a
bronzer or a highlight or blush whatever
you feel like so we're gonna go in with
these pink shades first probably just
bring my brushes over here we're gonna
do highlight first just change them I'm
taking a small stippling brush and this
is by morphe this is 2m 436 brush I'm
just going to take this light white
shade right here and we're just going to
put this right on the tops of the
cheekbones the appeal skin this is a
great highlight because it's like almost
straight up white oh yeah this is like
one of those products I always forget
how much I love it until I use it again
I don't know if I'm going to run this
down the bridge of my nose yet we'll see
how I feel in kind of want to keep it
more matte go for blush I'm going to go
in with these pink shades we're going to
finish up the brows afterwards I just
realized the apples of the cheeks for
brows I'm going to try out the NYX
eyebrow gel I've used this like a couple
times before I don't really remember if
I like it or if I don't like it every
single day use my Anastasia dip brow so
we'll see you switching it up for this
video
remember this is like super crazy
pigmented so I'm just putting a tiny bit
on the back up here and I'm just going
to run my normal eye brow brush through
this is a Sedona lace EB 23 let's just
do this so far so good I think I want to
keep a more natural brow so I'm just
going to focus this on the tail end and
put a tiny bit
of this in the front and just go upwards
I'm having kind of like a brow crisis
lately like I don't know what's going on
with them I don't know what shape I want
I just kind of go for it I want the
Chiefs a little bit more pinky and da
leg so I'm going to go in with this
wet-and-wild Fergie blush I love this
blush this is in the shade Center no
around the clock and I'm literally just
gonna go like that one time because it's
super pigmented you'll probably use this
for both cheeks yup putting this on the
apples of my cheek so if you smile
that's where you want to go so the eyes
are going to be let's get all these
brushes out of here you guys should see
my desk area after I film it's a little
absurd for Prime the eyes I'm just going
to take a tiny bit of concealer just
like a DAB and blend this out with my
finger for the crease I'm going to go in
with color pop iSpy which is this like
light orange shade it actually blends
out a lot lighter
I'm keeping the eyes super simple so I'm
just blending this all in the crease
from V let's zoom in so I'm just
blending this only crease from the outer
portion of my eye all the way inwards
next I'm going to take this Milani white
eye shadow this is the shade Bella white
this has a little bit of a sheen to it
we're playing this all over the lid and
kind of into that crease color I usually
use my finger but I want this a little
bit less saturated so when you do more
like classic or pin-up kind of makeup I
like to get the lower lash line almost
completely blanked so I'm not going to
blend in the eye shadow on the bottom
today I'm just gonna go in with some
liquid eyeliner this is the Milani eye
tech extreme liquid eyeliner I actually
really like this Physicians Formula is
still my holy grail but this stuff isn't
too bad the only thing I find is that it
transfers to my crease throughout the
day which is a little unfortunate we're
just going to create kind of a winged
cat eye effect so I just start in the
middle of my eye this is a really matte
black liquid eyeliner it's a lot more
matte than the Physicians Formula and I
like how it has a super thin point so
we're just going to take that and start
at the corner where my top meets my
bottom and we're just going to flip this
out so you'll see that it creates kind
of a thick - a thin line and then we're
just going to start about halfway
through that
and just drag over you might see your
line kind of like what's the word
staggering no not completely smooth if
you need to you can pull your eye out a
little bit but I'm just gonna go over
that line so it's a smooth line and
there you go I'm going to go back in
with that white shimmery shade and just
put a tiny bit of this under the brow
boom rich and I are having a debate
right now how babies can survive without
water that's crazy so for the water line
I'm going to go in with this G brand
waterproof white eyeliner I believe you
can get this on I Kate house and mine
definitely needs to be sharpened so I'm
gonna go with some false lashes I'm
using the I'm emo NT ro 9 I've never
used these before they look nice and
wispy I just want a super natural
looking lashes look nothing super
dramatic I'm going to cut a little bit
off I want my eyes to kind of wisp out
at the end oh I totally just cut from
the wrong end great when you cut your
lashes you always want to cut off from
the end portion not the inner portion
I'm going to take that eyeliner again
and just go back over the lash line so
we don't have any glue showing I'm just
taking some mascara and blending the
false lashes with our natural lashes for
the bottom lash line I usually layer on
the wet and wild mega length so we're
just going to go in with a super thin
coat today so for lips the LA splash
what is this mitten lip tint mousse in
the shade inflamed is one of my favorite
like classic kind of red shades this one
is super long-lasting so if you're going
out or whatever it's all good
so much concentration right now
so when that dries it just mattifies
perfectly it doesn't feel heavy at all
on the lips it's not super drying like
the colour-pop ones I really like these
liquid lipsticks alright so that is
everything super quick in fairly easy
look for hair i use the bombay gold
collection curling wand i believe this
is the 3/4 inch wand i'll link it down
below I also have a discount code for
you guys I use this pretty much every
single day for my hair I am going to be
having that hair tutorial coming soon
today I literally just ran it through
straight hair and this is what happened
