doing a foundation review got a
sweatshirt on didn't change because my
room is two degrees right now it's all
good so today I have a review and demo
of the Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation and concealer this is not a
new foundation but I feel like for some
reason getting a ton of hype right now
in the last few weeks I've gotten a ton
of requests from you guys to review this
foundation so that is what we are doing
today this is a review not a first
impression video since I've been using
this for the last few weeks but I'm
still going to show you how I apply it
in all that good stuff
so let's just get into it if you follow
me on social and on snapchat you already
kind of know my thoughts on this but I'm
just going to get into some of the pros
and cons so stunned nation is one fluid
ounce pretty standard it comes in 20
shades I'm going to start off by talking
about the shades because that's like the
biggest con for me I feel like the fact
that they have 20 shades should be a
good sign their shade finder and their
whole descriptions and numbering and
everything is like the most bizarre
thing I've ever seen if you're trying to
find the lightest shade or shade perfect
to your skintone I would not recommend
buying this online go into the Clinique
counter even then they don't have all
the shades of the foundation the
lightest shade which is 0.5 is only sold
online and if you use their shade finder
online you drag little bar all the way
where it says to very fair skin tones it
says that like number 4 is the lightest
or number 3 that is totally off I have
two different shades here because the
first one I worked it online actually a
while ago and I just never used it
because it was like way way too dark
this is the shade to alabaster and then
the one I ended up finding which I
realized is actually the lightest is 0.5
Brie's even the lightest shade breeze is
still too dark for me you guys will see
in the video but I do have to mix it
with a foundation later I can pull it
off without a foundation mixer barely my
face definitely looks darker than my
neck but it doesn't look Orange which is
a good thing but I feel like it looks
best when I mix it with foundation liner
if you're paler than I am just keep in
mind that this is going to be still way
too dark for you
we have to mix it with the foundation
mixer if you're around my skintone I
would say give it a try I wouldn't call
it a pale foundation by any means it's
barely doable so I'm going to show you
guys swatches of the shades 0.5 into
alabaster so you can see the difference
I did a ton of research online trying to
figure out what the heck is the lightest
shade and what the best shade for me is
in the end I figured out that is 0.5 so
don't go by what the Clinique website
says even on Sephora like they're all
out of order so you can't actually tell
what's the lightest shade their
descriptions are super unhelpful so
again just go into the actual counter
okay so on to some of the claims is
supposed to be a foundation and
concealer in one and I think their
packaging is kind of goes along with
that because with this big-ass one like
this is the hugest most dre enormous
concealer one I've ever seen and you're
supposed to just directly brush this on
your face which is pretty unsanitary
because you're supposed to just stick it
back in the thing that's what I've been
doing because it does apply best that
way I've tried to put it on a pallet but
it doesn't work as well so I do just
stroke it directly onto my face and then
blend out with a brush okay thank you so
much so supposed to be a lightweight
moisturizing makeup that covers
thoroughly without clogging pores I
haven't noticed this broken me out at
all I have super acne prone cystic acne
skin nine out of ten foundations break
me out and this hasn't broken me out at
all which is really awesome cuz it has a
rich pigment level for flawless coverage
makeup and I would definitely say that
this is a full coverage foundation you
can see that it does a pretty dang good
job of covering up all of my acne all of
my redness and I feel like it gives a
really nice flawless even application as
far as primers from what I found it does
just about the same with or without a
primer card just got full but we are
back I feel like my is this super
crooked yeah so retails for $27 I forgot
to mention that at the beginning and you
get one fluid ounce of product so for a
high-end foundation that's a pretty good
price I feel like as far as lasting
power it has been like 80 degrees in
Seattle and it is lasted pretty well
throughout the day I definitely need to
set it with a powder like I said but by
the end of the night
I'm not looking horrible my foundation
is still fully covering everything it
hasn't broken down and it looks really
nice oh I'm going to go into the demo
now so you guys can see before and after
and how it applies and what products I
use and all that good stuff all right my
neighbor is going to town with the
hammer right now so hopefully you guys
can't hear that it's my only day to film
so we're doing this so the primer that I
found works best with this foundation
for me is the Smashbox photo finish
primer water so I'm just going to spray
some this on my face this gives my face
a little bit of a globe I just love
using this with thicker foundations like
the Marc Jacobs remarkable and this guy
so the shade I'm using is 0.5 breeze
this is the lightest shade they make
their shade range on line is super weird
I'm just going to start I just literally
apply this directly to my face which I
don't know isn't the most sanitary
because you're putting this back in the
bottle since I have a ton to cover up I
put quite a bit on if you don't have
acne a lot of problem areas on your face
you could probably just use half of this
amount then I go in with this Lightner
and this is new I've never mentioned
this on my channel this is the stargazer
white foundation I mentioned the
stargazer powder a ton recently it's
been my favorite under-eye powder so I
wanted to try out their liquid product
kind of like the Manic Panic dreamtone
and I am going to be having a full
foundation mixer video coming soon I've
tried like doing this foundation with
Manic Panic and the next foundation
mixer and a few others and this one is
just my favorite for this foundation for
some reason I feel like it lasts the
longest and it doesn't alter the
consistency that much isn't as like pure
white pigment and some of the other
mixers and I've only used it a few times
so I don't want to give my like full
thoughts on it yet but I do like mixing
it with this foundation so as you can
see the coverage is like insane full
coverage looks beautiful doesn't look
cakey oh it's getting all really pretty
glowy finish and I totally forgot to
take before photo dang it I have an
insta cart grocery delivery coming right
now
I need to like wrap this up I'm gonna
look really cute going downstairs to get
my groceries okay so I don't really know
how much white I put on I put on like a
couple stripes and then just blend it in
as it's on my face I usually mix in
Lightner beforehand but I feel like this
foundation applies a lot better directly
apply it to your face versus like on a
pallet first if you're concerned with
like putting the applicator back in the
bottle you could use the foundation
pallet Jade 0.5 N is a pretty neutral
color I have worn it by itself without
foundation mixer and it definitely looks
a little bit too dark for my skin like
you can see even when I blended on my
neck you can see the distinction so I
can't go with just the shade 0.5 but if
you're a tiny bit darker than you 0.5
would probably be good for you if you're
lighter than me you're going to have to
mix in a lot more foundation Lightner
because I definitely wouldn't call this
like a pale foundation it barely is
doable for me by the way I totally
forgot to mention this the brush I used
to apply it is the Sigma f80 I've tried
four different brushes I've tried a
sponge I've tried everything to apply
this and this is my favorite brush to
apply this foundation I'll link it down
below along with my favorite makeup
brush video so at this point I still
have a few spots where I could add a
little bit more coverage I typically go
in with my concealer but for the sake of
the video I'm going to just spot conceal
to show you guys because it does claim
to be a foundation and concealer so I'm
just going to use the one to dot on and
conceal so you guys can see how it works
and you can use your finger or brush to
blend this out typically this concealer
I just use my finger feel like it gives
me the best coverage that fully it works
as concealer - it smells a little bit
chemically yeah it definitely has like a
stronger chemical smell I actually
prefer that than like having a perfumed
scent I can't handle the Dior
foundations that literally smells like a
perfume so here's what the skin looks
like before applying powder and
concealer and bronzer and all of that
good stuff on days where I don't want to
put on a full face of makeup I've just
done this and put on some brow gel I
have combo skin so I do get a little bit
oily throughout the day if I don't
powder this foundation I do get a lot
more oily than when I apply a powder to
set it so if you have oily skin just
keep that in mind this is pretty
moisturizing and dewy I do think that
dry skin could pull this off
definitely normal skin dry skin like it
doesn't cling to any patches at all on
me so maybe it's worth a shot if you
have dry skin so I'm going to apply the
rest of my face makeup and then we'll be
right back alright so here's all my
makeup on if you can find the right
shade for you I definitely think this
foundation is worth a try
I've been loving it I've been using it
literally every single day for the last
like three weeks which I feel like says
something because I usually change up my
foundation every single day I feel like
if Clooney came out with two more shades
that were like two lighter than the
shade 0.5 it would be perfection and I
would use this every single day of my
life I'm still kind of playing around
with the best powders for this
foundation but the two I've been using
most often that I like the best are the
Maybelline fit me powder in the shade
100 this is the lightest shade and does
help to lighten everything up a little
bit I don't like the madness of this
powder so I usually use a ton of
highlight when I use this the other
powder is the NARS all day luminous
powder in Syberia the only reason why I
use this is because the color has a
little bit of a yellow tint to it this
just has a tiny bit of yellow tone to it
this is a no luminous powder I don't
really know why they call it that the
closet look a cosmetic powder I was
mentioned celebration foundation
illumination that is way more luminous
than this powder so if you're looking
for a luminous powder don't buy this I
just mostly use this because I have it
and it adds a little bit of yellow tone
so that's what I use today and then I
also set my face with the mac fix+ spray
I find that after a powder it can kind
of take away some of the nice doing this
so that just brings everything back to
life I know on my lips right now is a
brand new color pop matte X collection I
did a full swatch and review video on
that so letting it down below along with
the makeup deals deals details for the
rest of my face that was everything let
