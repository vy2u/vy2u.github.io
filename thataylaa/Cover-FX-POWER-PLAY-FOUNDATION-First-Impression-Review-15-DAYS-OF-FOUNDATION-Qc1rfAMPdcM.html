are over and it's March alright so today
it is day three of fifteen days of
foundation this is why I try out a new
foundation every single day for 15 days
today we're gonna be talking about a
brand new foundation from cover effects
this is the powerplay foundation you get
one point one eight fluid ounces in here
which is a little bit more than the
standard one fluid ounce and it retails
for forty four dollars the super
exciting thing about this foundation is
that it comes in forty shades I love the
cover effect shade range and most of
their product not only do they have a
good shade selection but they typically
have really good undertones they have P
N and G which is golden pink neutral
golden and the cover FX drops I have the
shade n 10 which if I use them just on
their own it's a little bit light for my
skin now they used to match me about a
year and a half ago now that my skin has
somehow changed a little bit I feel like
I've gotten darker about half shade to
shade so I just use them to mix I love
those drops one of my favorite products
but I got the shade P 20 in this one I
was debating between P 20 and n 20 but
the swatches on their site looked pretty
similar in those too so I don't know I
just went with P 20 and I figured I
could mix it if I need a little bit more
pink in a foundation so it says this has
buildable medium to full coverage with a
modern matte finish supposed to control
shine and visibly blur imperfections and
stay all day without drying or dulling
the complexion it's sweat proof
waterproof transfer proof it says it's
vegan cruelty-free and I'm just now
seeing on here that the skin types they
recommend for this hour combination to
oily skin so right now I have normal to
dry skin from accutane I'm on month 5
before I Q tain I was combo oily and
after accutane I'll probably be back to
combo oily which is what I've been
reading is that your skin kind of goes
back to oily when you're off it so we'll
see but right now I'm definitely more on
normal to dry side so I'm gonna serve
swatches right here so you can see what
the shade p20 looks like compared to
some of my other foundations
all right so swatches the third over is
actually the powerplay foundation I was
just doing some other swatches so right
here is the cover FX custom cover drops
in the shade and ten next over is the
Marc Jacobs remarkable in the lightest
shade ten again the cover affects power
play in P 20 NARS radiant foundation in
Mont Blanc CYO lifeproof in 101 derma

so I haven't actually posted the
announcement video I post it tonight
alright here we go if you want to see my
thoughts on the cover effects power play
foundation you're in the right place
just keep watching I just have this hair
sitting on my table right now
these are clip-on bangs that I got off
of wish would not recommend okay it's
8:07 in the morning March 1st has
actually been about I think about a week
since I filmed so I feel a little out of
it right now I actually got really sick
and now I have some kind of weird throat
thing that I'm on antibiotics for but
had to start filming so this shade p20
looks promising it might actually be a
little bit light we'll see looking
against my neck my face is a lot darker
and more red than my body so here's what
the packaging looks like it is just a
squeeze kind of tube right here I don't
mind a squeeze tube I actually kind of
like it because it's super easy I'm
gonna shake this because it seems pretty
liquidy I've already washed moisturize
prepped my skin the products I've been
using will be linked down below in the
description box half my face I'm gonna
use my la girl sponge which is dampen
the other half my Sigma f80 I'm gonna go
in oh I think this is gonna be too late
so it's supposed to be medium to full
coverage I think the shade will be fine
once I warm up my face and everything
mmm I don't know I feel like one shade
darker would almost be too dark maybe I
should have gone for the neutral because
this one's looking a tiny bit pink
it is the pee undertone oh that looks
nice on the forehead it looks pretty
matte but it looks very smooth it's
already majorly creasing right here holy
 cease so this bun just looking like
medium coverage it feels like a lot more
matte or something on this side like it
has this grip to it it's not hard to
blend out it's just drying super super
quick I definitely need that sponge just
smooth out around my nose I am getting
better coverage with a brush it's not
looking great but it's not looking bad
prefer this sponge on my forehead I'm
gonna smooth it out I feel like this one
is very matte and it dries super quickly
so I do like how you have a little bit
more time to work with it with a sponge
my forehead looks great everywhere else
I'm not loving how it looks have a few
dry patches right now around my mouth
right here and then also some under my
nose just from below my nose 5000 times
this side I got much lighter coverage on
this side but you can still see a lot
coming through so I'm gonna try and do a
thin kind of second layer just on the
areas I need it I'm not gonna do my
forehead I'm just gonna do right here
and right here to see if we can build it
up and I'm gonna do it with a sponge
because I definitely prefer the finish
with the sponge and like I said it dries
hella quick so sponge with a little bit
of moisture is definitely the way to go
that built but I still wouldn't say it's
full coverage now it just looks like
solid medium coverage like doing
something weird on my dry patches around
my mouth nor this lip peeling I know but
look at how frickin dry and crepey and
just how much it's creasing right there
and then also on this side the dryness
it is clinging right here forehead looks
pretty nice and it's not clinging
anywhere on my forehead I do feel like I
can really feel this on my face right
now I wouldn't say it feels really
lightweight or anything I don't know I'm
gonna do the rest of my makeup and then
I'll be right back okay so right now
it's 854 I'm gonna call the check-in
time 8:30 because I've just been forever
and a half
the rest of my makeup there's a lot of
fuss I'm done by Clint now looking at
the foundation so the one thing I like
at this point is that it is kind of self
setting I didn't have to use any kind of
a setting powder to blend out product on
top of here so I don't have any powder
on my face right now and this does say
it's supposed to be oil controlling to
so if you do have oily skin this might
be one that might help control oil
throughout the day I'm hoping this
doesn't make me super dry because of
that so I like that it was easy to blend
product on top I definitely don't feel
like I need a powder it doesn't feel
super tacky or anything it does feel
like it's set down so I do like that as
far as how it's looking I am getting
major friggin creases I mean around my
mouth this is bad like I rarely get this
bad of creasing around this area I
usually get my creasing right in here it
looks very makeup be it looks great on
my areas like right here where I don't
have a lot of texture and stuff but
anywhere where I have texture pores
where I usually get creasing like all
this whole area right here is not
looking great my forehead looks pretty
good it is starting to crease a little
bit up here it looks pretty nice from
far away it's just when I get up close
or I'm like yikes as of right now I
wouldn't put this on my face again alone
if I did use this again the thing with
mixing is I always try and mix two
products that I like something in one
that the other one might be missing but
I have to like both foundations it's
just they're better together if that
makes sense so with this foundation I
think the only thing I would kind of use
this for mixing is the pink tone if I
had a super yellow tone foundation that
I wanted to kind of lighten and add a
little pink I could use this but the
coverage isn't really something I would
mix it for and the finish is definitely
not something I would mix it for and it
is very matte so if I mix this with
something it would be something like the
Estee Lauder Double Wear nude that's
really the only way I see myself using
this as mixing it so on the rest of my
face for bronzer I use the bronze &amp;amp; Glow
by makeup revolution this looked a lot
warmer today than the first time I used
it I don't know it looked like very warm
I've been obsessed with this blush and
it was a limited edition so I need to
stop using it but is the Mac bareness
extra dimension blush I got this off of
glambot and it's just such a pretty like
glowy neutral color for a highlight I
tried out this new NARS hi
this is the Capri highlight it's like
this light pink shade this was beautiful
the packaging so nice on my lips I used
one of my favourites l'oreal infallible
tongue-tied it's like one of my go-to
colors i topped it off with the
maybelline vivid hot lacquer in the
shade tees and then my eye shadow i
actually tried the bad habit or a
palette my cousin used this in the 10
year old does my makeup video but I
actually haven't tried it until today
this is supposed to be an Anastasia dupe
I did a whole video comparing a hush
subculture dupe against another dupe and
that was a total fail but in the
comments a bunch of you guys said to try
out this palette because this one is
supposed to be really good and so far I
like this out of the shades I used this
was really pretty this is all of my
eyeshadows today except for the purple
I used this purple liner this is the
L'Oreal infallible and purple violet and
then just blended some bright purple
shadow from the BH Cosmetics zodiac
palette I'm gonna have to try this more
but definitely went much better than the
other hush palette and I think that's
everything
I'll give you guys a little update on
this brow product since I mentioned it
in the drugstore try on haul video I've
been using this almost every single day
and the thing with this is that the
applicator on this sucks
like the applicator is horrible you get
way too much product out on this little
wand thing what I've been doing is just
taking my eyebrow brush and just going
right in to either the tip or just even
right here and then going in and just
filling in my brows and it works amazing
it does last through water is a very
long-lasting I like how it just kind of
like stays there stays in place so I've
been really liking this if you use it in
a different way like don't use the
applicator just as like a menu review
session so I'm gonna show you guys what
this thing looks like in natural
lighting right now and then we're gonna
do a little flash test it's a crazy fact
we actually have Sun right now so I'm
standing in front of the window and
natural lighting right now so here's
that weird creasing and clinging also
you can see it clinging to my dryness
right here and are decreasing over here
it seems to be almost actually rubbing
off a little bit right here or something
I didn't see that before
but also a tiny bit on the center of my
forehead hopefully that doesn't get
worse throughout the day
but I've definitely seen my forehead
look worse especially with kind of matte
oil controlling foundation so it doesn't
look horrible but here it is in natural
lighting so let's go do a little flash
test
I always forget I need my phone for this
and got a photo with the wall oh look
and ghostly
why does flash make your teeth look so
yellow what's up with that flash I don't
see that this has SPF in it online so
check-in time is 8:30 I'll see you guys
in a few hours in natural lighting what
time is it 116 so it's been on for
almost 5 hours got my hot back on right
now so it's looking pretty crappy not
loving how it looks I look hella dry
like even drier than this morning and
crustier than this morning Oh like
that's dryness from like I said blowing
my nose and stuff so that's gonna be
there but my lip lines right here have
definitely gotten worse around here this
whole area looks really gross yeah I
definitely don't love how my forehead
looks now it looks super dry keep in
mind they do say this is more for combo
oily skin and it is supposed to have oil
controlling properties throughout the
day so I wasn't expecting it to really
like keep my skin moisturize and stuff
so I easily could look much better on
oily skin this is just my skin so we're
testing it don't really have a choice I
feel pretty cool if you could like
switch between skin types don't love it
right now
we'll see how it wears at the end of the
night well I think we will be testing
this waterproof claim because I just
posted the announcement video literally
20 minutes ago in my time today and I've
just been getting a little most reading
all of your comments I love you guys and
I so appreciate everyone who has already
bought a t-shirt just in the first like
20 minutes that the videos been up and
I'm just so excited to see what you guys
can do throughout this 15 days it's
actually now oh there's my alarm for
this it's now 6:40 so it's been on for
10 hours wow I am so dry over here and
now it is like totally peeling off ooh
that is like crusty it looks pretty much
the same as last check-in but I actually
feel like I'm even drier you can see my
skin
peeling in certain areas that could be
because of like the oil controlling
thing and my skin is already dry it is
supposed to be transfer proof so I'm
wearing a white sweater so don't want to
like hug myself but I am gonna use just
the back of my hand and kind of press
see this transfer proof feels like a
powder I don't really see anything on my
hand look in the mirror let's try my
nose I can't really tell just a tiny bit
on my hand not stayed on my nose pretty
well so I guess that's exciting if
you're looking for like a transfer proof
yeah it's really not it's not rubbing
off so that's exciting if that's the
only thing I like about this with like
the pink undertone that could be enough
incentive for me to mix this in with
something if we want to make something
last a little bit longer and be transfer
proof then I potentially might mix in
like a drop of this but this is so
freakin matte and dry that I feel like
on my skin right now it's just not the
best but I think in about a month when
I'm off accutane and my skin is a little
bit more normal
oily again probably I would try this out
again so if you have a very very oily
skin you might want to get a sample this
one if you can't ask for and try it out
because it does seem to be like very
second all the moisture out of my skin
which I know is something I probably
would have liked when I had oily skin
mature skin any kind of creasing texture
stay away from this one like I said I'm
getting creasing in places I normally
don't at all that's how I feel about
this one definitely I think made for
oily skin and would not call this full
coverage I think this is about medium
coverage that's that so don't forget the
link to vote one time a day is down
