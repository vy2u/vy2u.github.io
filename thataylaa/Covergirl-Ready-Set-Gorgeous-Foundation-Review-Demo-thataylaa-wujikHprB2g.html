does she ever not look good so today I
have a review slash demo for you guys on
the new covergirl Ready Set gorgeous
foundation saw my girl Katy Perry
staring at me and I just had to get it
marketing at its finest in the
collection there was also concealers
powders and makeup wipes I didn't want
to try out the new foundation because
they all know I'm a foundation hoarder
along with everything else makeup
related so the Ready Set gorgeous
foundations come in twelve shades which
is pretty great covergirl tends to do a
pretty good job about having a good
assortment of shades the lightest shade
is 105 and clearly I'm a little on the
pale side I show you in the demo what it
looks like by itself on my skin I think
you could get away with it but for me
it's just a little bit too dark I would
say like half a shade to a shade too
dark so what I do is mix it in with my
Manic Panic dreamtone if you're new to
my channel I have a whole video about
how to lighten your foundations using
this stuff so that is what I do in the
demo I show you both unless you're
extremely fair like me or very dark I'm
pretty sure this foundation would have
your shade but on the back it says that
it is oil-free won't clog pores and is
suitable for sensitive skin so I have
acne prone combination skin I do get a
little bit oily throughout the day and
this says that it is a flawless natural
look that lasts all day so I'm obviously
wearing this foundation right now I'm
wearing it for the past four days I've
gotta say I am thoroughly impressed with
covergirl I've never met a covergirl
foundation that I'm absolutely in love
with until this guy came along so let's
just start off by talking about the
packaging it comes in this squeeze tube
which when I first saw this I thought it
was going to be a pretty thick formula
because usually foundations that come in
squeeze tubes like NYX invincible tend
to be pretty thick if you want to see my
thoughts on this one I have a whole get
ready video mentioning this the formula
was not what I expected at all it
doesn't feel like a cream if anything it
applies more like a liquid foundation
rather than
a cream I do like the packaging though
because you don't have to deal with like
pouring it out on the back of your hand
you can just put a little squeeze and
you're good to go also can we just look
at the pink love it
who doesn't like pink so as far as the
application goes for this foundation my
favorite way to apply it is with either
the morphe brushes at foundation brush
or the Sigma f80 kabuki brush I just
find that these give the best coverage
and finish that I prefer it blends out
super easily the thing that I like most
about this foundation is that it really
does feel super natural on the skin it
doesn't feel like you're wearing a
foundation but it gives you that
coverage that I usually look for in a
foundation I feel like I'm out of breath
coverage I would say is medium coverage
because the consistency is pretty thin I
guess it is definitely easily built able
to a full coverage foundation which is
how I like to wear it because got a
cover-up on my acne scarring it sets
really nicely on the skin it dries
pretty fast it just feels like I'm not
really wearing a heavy foundation and
that is amazing for me because it like I
said I like a full coverage foundation
and really feel like I'm wearing full
coverage is like whole new territory for
me the finish of this foundation I don't
think it's dewy and I don't think it's
completely matte it's right in the
middle probably like a satin finish as
far as the lasting power goes I've been
wearing this everyday for pretty much 12
hours it doesn't break down throughout
the day like I said I've combination
oily skin and I don't find myself
getting oily I usually get really oily
around my nose and my forehead and this
has pretty much controlled my oil I
don't think it does as amazing job of
oil control as the Revlon Colorstay but
we have a combination skin it'll
definitely work for you I was actually
pleasantly surprised by the longevity of
this foundation I really have zero
complaints about this foundation I think
that if you're curious about it and
you're on the market for a new
foundation or you're just a makeup
addict like me I would definitely
recommend trying this foundation out
love the finish of it I love that it
doesn't feel like I'm wearing
rich foundation and I've just been
reaching for this every day so if you
like this review and it was helpful for
you be sure to give it a thumbs up so I
know if any of you have tried anything
else from the race that gorgeous line
comment down below and let me know what
I should get love you guys thanks for
watching see you in my next video bye
how long has my hair been like that
probably the whole video all I can smell
right now is my Old Spice deodorant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
