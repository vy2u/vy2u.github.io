doing an all drug store all cruelty free
video on the look I'm wearing right now
didn't really know what look I was going
for and then it turned into a full-blown
smokey vampy look story of my life the
main goal of this video is to show you
guys how many cruelty free brands and
products there are at the drugstore as
well as high-end before I started
researching for this video I had no idea
how many cruelty free brands there
really are I just want to say right now
that at this point in time I do not use
100% cruelty free products in all of my
videos feel like now that I know more
about it and know that there are so many
products widely available I'm going to
be more aware and conscious of the
products that I choose to feature in
videos I'm not saying that I'm going
100% cruelty free I think if I didn't do
YouTube it would be a no-brainer for me
but because my whole channel is based on
product reviews and foundation Friday
and 15 days of foundation I don't feel
like I'm at a place where I can 100% go
cruelty free on YouTube but when I am
repurchasing products and using products
in my everyday life I am going to be
more aware of how I shot everything is a
personal choice but at the end of the
day I do believe that your dollar in a
sense is your vote I very much believe
in harm reduction so if you can't fully
do something at some point anything that
you can do to consume less I think is a
step in the right direction so before we
get into the makeup I do want to talk to
you guys a little bit about cruelty free
because if you're like me and you're
coming into this video with very limited
knowledge about this I just want to
share some of the things I learned and
some of the resources so that you can
form your own opinions and make your own
decisions based on that if you're not
interested in hearing the whole spiel
you can just fast forward to this time
right here if you're wondering what
brands are aren't cruelty free there are
a few different ways to find out you can
check that blog that I linked down below
because she does upload it pretty
regularly you can google it a lot of the
times it'll pop up in Google whether it
is or not and just read other blog posts
PETA's website does list cruelty free
brands but I just want to say you have
to be careful with some of them because
we'll say products and sometimes certain
products are cruelty free but their
overall brand isn't cruelty free
anything that has the little bunny stamp
on it doesn't mean that every ingredient
used to make that product is cruelty
free so there could still be ingredients
used in a product that have been tested
on animals it just means that the end
result and the end product wasn't tested
on animals China is really the big thing
to look out for because any product
that's sold on the Chinese market has to
be tested on animals by law in China so
it's kind of an interesting mix of
culture and getting a little bit
international relations and the apology
major on you but it is interesting when
you look at the difference in cultures
so farm just a business perspective I
think it's really going to take a change
in the Chinese government to make any
kind of very significant change because
the Chinese market is so freaking huge
all of the huge companies like L'Oreal
Revlon estée lauder
all of these giant companies have such
an influence and if they're not selling
in China they're losing a huge chunk of
money so until the Chinese government
changes their laws about animal testing
I think all these huge companies are
going to continue to test on animals
with that being said they're a bunch of
cruelty-free brands that are actually
umbrella under non cruelty free
companies for example it cosmetics has
been cruelty free since they started but
they recently just got acquired by
L'Oreal urban decay which is cruelty
free is a subsidiary of L'Oreal NYX even
is owned by L'Oreal people kind of have
two different opinions on that there's
one opinion saying even if a brand is
cruelty free like urban decay if you're
purchasing urban decay in the end it
goes up to L'Oreal which isn't a
cruelty-free company on the other hand
you can say that even though you are in
the end supporting L'Oreal they do
massive research and can figure out why
one company is doing better for example
anything that you say on social media if
you love a brand and you love it they're
cruelty-free let them know if you love a
brand that isn't cruelty-free let them
know because social media teams do share
that information with the rest of the
team which goes to other teams which
goes to eventually people higher up you
have more of a voice and who can make
decisions on behalf of a company there's
people whose sole job is to analyze what
aspects of different companies are doing
better and why so that's something that
they would look at so
it's kind of the other side of the
argument in this video I just did brands
that are cruelty free so they might be
owned by L'Oreal like NYX but the actual
brand itself is cruelty free I found a
couple amazing resources one of them is
cruelty free Kitty I believe it's called
and she basically has updated list of
cruelty free brands drugstore high-end
vegan I think - I'm relieved her blog
post down below and then I also listen
to a podcast that was really good at
explaining the different perspectives
and it kind of explains the other side
of it which is if we don't test on
animals is it still safe for humans and
since it's 2016 should we be able to
find other things to test on other than
lives which my personal belief is we
should be able to do that scientifically
and companies might just not have enough
push to do that because it is likely a
lot more expensive than testing on
animals anyways I'm gonna leave that
podcast down below I believe it was from
either stuff you should know or a
Nerdist now that I've talked for what
feels like 20 minutes if you want to see
how I got this look you're in the right
place just keep watching alright feel a
little bit out of it because I took my
grandpa this morning this is all a heat
rash so we can just move on not a hickey
I'm going to start with this oil control
primer space spay by city color
cosmetics a lot of these products are
first impressions for me actually like
most of them so I haven't used this yet
but city color is cruelty free I'm not
gonna say that about every brand because
obviously if it's in this video it is
cruelty free it says fresh citrus scent
so this should be interesting and I'm
just going to use this as a primer I'm
not going to use any other primer today
on my face smells kind of like bathroom
spray I do have combination skin so I
get oily in my t-zone a little bit
throughout the day and I want to use a
dewy setting spray so I want to see how
it wears with an oil controlling product
underneath so for foundation you guys
know I love trying out new foundations I
do foundation Friday on my channel every
single Friday so today I'm trying out
this one I've never tried this as the
elf flawless finish foundation in the
shade porcelain the lightest shade of
elf foundations
usually tend to be pretty dark on me so
I'm going to try it without a mixer
first just to see and then if we do need
to mix it
both of these are cruelty free mixers
Manic Panic dreamtone which is probably
my favorite mixer and then ELF pro
foundation mixer I feel like this one
doesn't give as much coverage this one
I've used for years I've talked about on
my channel for years but first let's try
out this guy actually before we do
foundation I am in a spot conceal
because I've been doing that lately I
just feel like I have to use way less
foundation when I spot conceal typically
when I do my foundation Friday videos I
don't spot conceal with foundation
because I want to see how it performs on
its own the sense this isn't like a
dedicated first impression on a
foundation I'm going to spot conceal
today and I'm using the wet and wild
cracked celebrity concealer this is
freaking awesome you guys this is in the
shade fair it's very light has amazing
coverage I don't like it for under my
eyes because it is very thick but for
spot concealing it's great and for
brushes I'm using a mix of morphe
wet-and-wild and elf all these brushes
I'm using our cruelty free this is the
morphe g 38 i love this brush for
concealing under my eyes and for spot
concealing this is an awesome brush I
haven't tried mixing this concealer yet
with foundations but I kind of want it
because it has pretty damn good coverage
and is lighter so I feel like it could
be a good mixer if you have pretty good
skin to begin with you obviously
wouldn't need two spot conceal first so
now what's going with this foundation
and it does have a pump which is
exciting
I love how like $6 foundations can put a
pump on but some high-end foundations
still don't have a pump the elf acne
fighting foundation is one of my
favorite foundations mixed actually just
did a whole drugstore acne coverage
video where I use that foundation mix
with another one actually both of those
foundations that I used were cruelty
free oh here it comes I can feel it
there we go so I put about revenue now
large dime sized amount no more than
that probably a quarter I'm going in
with the elf brush that I love for
foundation all the exact brushes I'm
using and products are going to be
linked down below just going to start by
step on this all over my face
hopefully it's light enough well this is
very yellow toned I figured it out guys
I filmed how I did my makeup in high
school video yesterday and when I had on
the black
I looked super pale again so I think
it's just the hair like I feel like the
hair makes me look darker I don't know
and also I think it's how the camera and
the lighting with the hair works is when
you have black hair whether sound like
snapchat or a high quality camera it
blows out the rest of the image so it
just makes me look lighter on camera and
I feel like now with this hair I look
darker so I don't know this is blending
out really nicely
definitely don't need a second layer now
they how that kind of sealer on but even
on the spots I didn't put concealer like
my chin it's covering very well it feels
a tiny bit heavier than the elf acne
fighting foundation like I can I can
feel foundation on my face right now
I'm hoping this doesn't oxidize because
if this oxidizes it's definitely going
to be too dark so I did use that whole
amount and I would say it's about high
medium coverage looking at my forehead
it's not totally full coverage I think
once it sets it looks a little bit more
satin matte if you're a little bit
lighter than I am this will be too dark
so you'll have to mix in a mixer so free
concealer I'm going to use a Catrice
liquid camouflage high coverage
concealer I did a full review of this
and they're all matte plus foundation
during 15 days of foundation I don't
reach for this concealer a whole lot I
think it's good it's just not my
favorite Tarte shave tape which Tarte is
also cruelty free it's not drugstore is
amazeballs so I'm going to blend this
out with that same brush from morphe I'm
going to set the under eyes with my
favorite Physicians Formula translucent
light setting powder this is the morphe
e 7 brush setting powder I'm using the
elf perfect finish HD powder this is the
pressed powder version pretty sure I
just use this one in a video but I can't
remember if I like it or not yeah I
don't know why but I feel like
translucent powders with the exception
of a couple always take away some
coverage I am going to set my whole face
today because I'm going to be going in
with a dewy setting spray that will help
to bring back some of the dew I'm
probably not gonna be reaching for this
one again but that's just me personally
I don't really like translucent powders
a whole lot so now on to brows I'm gonna
be using the Ardell dark brown brow
pomade I like darker brows with my hair
because my roots are a little bit darker
this isn't
awesome brow pomade I feel like this is
totally underrated I think this is just
as good as the Anastasia brow pomade
this broad just got a little intense but
I'm going to be using product to carve
it out a little bit so it's all good to
set just the front of my brows because
this is a lighter shade I'm going to be
using the essence make me brow eyebrow
gel this isn't a shade blondie brow so
it is lighter never actually used this
shade ooh that might be a little too
late that's okay then to carve out my
brows and prime my eyes I'm using the
NYX eyeshadow base and I've taken the
morphe 43 brush since this is a flat
edge it's just really easy to carve out
your brows with this when you guys are
watching this I will still be in New
York so make sure you follow me on
snapchat Twitter instead if you want to
see what's going on my hair will have
also changed so if you want to see the
new hair putting in taping extensions
tomorrow in my time what is this brow
you're doing get back in line bro now
that that's on let's move on to bronzer
I am very excited to try this this is
pixi by petra Beauty bronzer in the
shade set Elise untouched and this looks
like a nice kind of reddish bronzer
which I've been all about lately pixie I
guess is considered drugstore because
it's carried at Target but is on the
pricier end of drugstore it actually
comes with a brush which feels kind of
nice mmm
I'm gonna use my favorite wet and wild
brush to contour slash bronze and this
has like a screw-off lid I really like
the green packaging on pixie I've never
actually tried any of their beauty
products so this is the first time I
don't know how pigmented this is ooh I
like that I feel like a lot of the
product is kicking up like it is a
little bit powdery but it almost makes
it easier to blend because of that I'm
gonna have that smell this is a really
nice more red toned bronzer yeah I like
this if you have pale skin I think this
one could be a winner because I'm really
swirling and like building it up to get
this kind of pigment so if you're
lighter than I am
you could probably just use a lighter
hand for blush I'm using the NYX baked
blush in the shade
chiffon I use this in my drugstore first
impressions video and I didn't like it
then because you had to seriously like
swirly brush to get any kind of product
off but I figured out there's just an
overlay over this product when you first
get it so when you first get it go get a
tissue and like wipe off that top layer
really well and then you'll actually get
the product underneath and once you make
it to the product it is way more
pigmented blends easily I actually
really like this blush and the shade
taking the e53 really pretty like
natural shade so now on to highlight I'm
using the wet and wild illuminating
palette in the shade catwalk pink this
is one of my favorite drugstore
highlighters it's amazeballs
and my brush that I used to highlight is
a sigma fo3 from what i can tell there
are two lines from sigma that are
cruelty free it says that they have
started the process of making all of
their brushes cruelty free this was a
year ago when this post was written back
then it says they're full sigma tech
line and sigmax line are all cruelty
free and vegan so this one is from the
sigmax line and i'm just whirling the
two lightest shades this is very
pigmented dishes formulas shimmer brick
it's another option that is my favorite
highlight from the drugstore natural
nude it's stunning also essence
snowflake eyeshadow it's actually an
eyeshadow I've mentioned this like 50
times on my channel but beautiful
highlight as you want to switch it up
and use this one cuz I haven't used this
for a while in a video now the
foundations been on for a little bit I
do feel like it's slightly dark it's not
showing up on camera but when I look in
this mirror looks a little dark before I
go on to eyeshadow I'm going to set my
face I have two different options here
both illuminating setting sprays hard
candy sheer nd hydrating primer this is
technically a primer by been using this
over my foundation it is beautiful if
you want something that is seriously
dewy talked about this on snapchat but
honestly this is 50 times better than
the talkshow luminous skin mist critius
is under 10 bucks this one is a little
bit more pricey this is the pixie glow
mist haven't tried this one yet because
I haven't tried the pixie I'm going to
go for this one but I just wanted to
show you guys this one if you want more
of an affordable option this looks like
there's some
oil yes it has argan oil hoping that
doesn't break me out
you can tell has argan oil because you
have to shake it or else oil will just
be sitting at the top kind of smells
like a hair product to me right off the
bat let me tell ya the hard candy one is
a lot more dewy we're trying use a
little bit more of this because I'm not
looking that dewy looking slightly dewy
expecting a little bit more do from that
I don't know I feel like my forehead
looks pretty matte still I take a couple
spritzes of the hard candy actually
changed the top on this because the top
mine came with it was like clogged for
some reason but it comes with a white
top I'm just gonna do a couple spritzes
because this stuff is intense this one
smells like melon II definitely prefer
the scent in this one better yeah this
is so much do I don't know if you guys
can see that on the forehead but check
out that do Hill yeah I love this stuff
now that we talked about settings berry
for five minutes I also wanted to
mention I forgot if you need a contour
shade and not a bronzer la colors is
cruelty free and I've been liking this
shade right here this is in the
light/medium palette I also have the
dark medium no the medium to deep
palette to show you one of my pans fill
out right there but these are the
differences in colors I'm actually gonna
be using some of these as eyeshadows
today because they have some really nice
like orange e Brown shades and you
actually got both of these for ten bucks
on Ike a house calm I'll leave a link to
IKEA house below but they have them
awesome cheap makeup on there so start
for the eyeshadow I'm going to go in
with that medium deep palette start out
with this peach shade right here and put
that into the crease and take the r39
brush think I'm going to go in with this
shade right here actually no I'm going
to use this one I'm just deepening up
that crease a little bit I think I'm
going to go in with this makeup
revolution unicorns unite salvation
palette very exciting purple metallic
box haven't used this before but makeup
revolution eye shadows are typically
pretty good you can get makeup
revolution at Ulta or online and they're
very affordable there's a couple rows of
shimmery shades in here and then a row
of matte shades so I'm actually gonna go
with that matte black take the e17 brush
and putting this just mostly on the
outer V and then kind of blending it
inwards
I'm gonna use an empty brush to blend
this more into the crease so for now I'm
just kind of packing on that color and
blending it inward
go back in with the 39 so it is our 39
brush and just blend that black very
lightly into the crease now for the fun
part I'm going to go in with this NYX
pigment this is the ultra pearl mania in
the shade silver I don't know if this is
more like a gunmetal or silver but we
will find out hooded lids man go to
blend like 50 times so I'm gonna put a
little bit of this out just in this
little plastic thing then I'm actually
going to mix in some of that pixie spray
just to get it super metallic and so
it's going to stay on really well
without fallout boo this looks pretty
I'm just going to put this right on oh
hell yeah
holy cease I'm just going to bring
this right into that black shade we're
gonna have to go back and blend don't
worry about it not blending into the
black right now may have just found my
new favorite shade this shadow for like
prom or something would be beautiful
good thing about wetting these is that
you don't get any fallout and they're
gonna stay on and you just get like
insane metallic or something to go back
with the r39 without any product on it
and just blend with whatever's left over
on the brush into that gray shade then
I'm just going to add a tiny dab of the
black to blend now if there was any part
where you feel like the silver faded
away a little bit you can just go back
in and add that I'm going to take this
essence smokey eye liner in gray to meet
you
never put this on my waterline never use
this so I'm not sure how it's going to
go on but we'll find out bring this a
little bit below the waterline because
we're going to blend shadow down there
doesn't go on the waterline the best I'm
actually going to use this sponge
applicator they come
with the makeup forever palette just to
smudge out the gray eyeliner with some
black eyeshadow I'm gonna go back in
with the LA Colors contour palette and
I'm going to take that same brown shade
that we put in the crease donuts and
fall out now that we are looking nice
and smoky brush away that fall out
baiting with or wanting to lose eyeliner
a lot today I kind of won't just put on
falsies but I want to show you
eyeliner option I've never tried this
one before but this is the wet and wild
on edge cream liner this is a gel liner
I think we're going to use it I'm just
cleaning off my eyebrow brush but I'm
actually going to use that same brush
for the eyeliner debating whether one do
a wing or not I just want to like smudge
it and then put on some lashes yeah I
think that's what we're going to do I'm
not really creating like a defined wing
I'm just smudging it out this isn't the
blackest black if you want a good
cruelty free eyeliner Physicians Formula
I booster in ultra black that's like my
Holy Grail eyeliner make sure you get
the ultra black shade though because
it's a black into an ultra black they
look identical except ultra black is 50
times better now we're going to go in
for falsies and I have to say lash glue
for me was the only thing that it was
really tricky to find any kind of
information about I tweeted you guys
asking if any of you could find
information about the kiss us a brand on
PETA's website it says that they're a
cruelty free brand but under products
that only lists nail products there have
been a few other blog posts saying that
kissed lash products are cruelty free
but there's no sources listed or
anything they tweeted kiss and I haven't
gotten a response yet so from what you
guys are tweeting me and from what I've
read this is cruelty free but please let
me know down below if you have any
insight onto whether or not the lash
products are cruelty free by kiss
another option is the duo lash adhesive
I actually really don't like this lash
glue which is why I'm going to use this
one today this is my favorite drugstore
lash glue I use this almost every time I
put on lashes duo lash products are
cruelty free they're brush on strip
adhesive is a lot better than the tube
one but I actually don't have that
because I ran out of it before we put on
falsies I'm just going to coat my upper
lashes really quick with Wet n Wild mega
length usually is this for the bottom
lashes but I don't really care what
lashes look like underneath falsies I
just want them to be black and for false
lashes today I'm using the I'll or
number 121 these are some of my favorite
false lashes they have such a nice like
cat-like effect love eye lower lashes
the band is a little bit thicker so some
people might not be about that but I
personally like it feel like it makes it
a lot easier to apply and get these at
Ulta and they usually have like a buy
one get one free kind of deal on aisle
or well these are drying I'm going to
put some wet and wild make a link
mascara on the bottom lashes favorite
bottom lash mascara lips I have a few
different options I want to show you
guys wet and wild just came out with new
matte liquid lipsticks which I kind of
want to try but I don't know I feel like
these colors might be kind of intense
I'm leaning towards this one but that'll
be like a very intense look also Jordana
modern matte lipsticks these are bomb
formulas I've used these for a couple
years now since they came out the shade
what is this this is totally worn off I
feel like it was called matte innocence
but that might be Milani I'll leave the
exact name down below to one of my
favorites but it's the shade right here
it's totally worn off or we could go for
more nude shade which is Catrice 380
nude tastic I haven't tried this one yet
kind of feeling this like tone down the
whole look a little bit yeah I might use
this this shade is kind of speaking to
me though okay I think I'm first gonna
do a nude lip just so you guys can see
how it looks and if you're not about
like dark vampy colors you could use
this I'm not going to use a lip liner do
you smell like straight-up grape candy
or something it's definitely more of a
peachy nude
so here's Catrice new tastic now I'm
going to go in for the liquid lips the
same way too excited I'm going to wet
this off and go in with this guy because
I feel like I can't say no to vampy
liquid lipsticks so this is in the shade
don't be a plum plum oh heck yeah
since the applicator of this is like a
little bit weirdly frayed it's a little
bit tricky to get a super crisp line
this applicator is a little rough first
layer it looks a little bit streaky I'll
definitely have to go in for the second
layer once this dries down a little bit
this is more of a liquidy formula so I'm
gonna let it dry a tiny bit and then
just cover up some of the patches I feel
like it looks most patchy on my upper
lip all right so this is the final look
