current foundation routine you guys know
I'm obsessed with my Maybelline Dream
wonder foundation but I do think that
that and my benefit Porefessional was
causing me to majorly breakout so since
I'm kind of been just experimenting with
different foundations and seeing what
works with my skin tone and just with
what I like I have finally found a
combination that I am super excited
about it's one of those things where I
feel like it actually looks better as
the day goes on I put on my makeup at
6:30 in the morning everyday for work
and when I get home around like 8
o'clock it is still looking good like I
could go out if I wanted to so this is a
super long lasting full coverage
foundation routine my foundation routine
will work for people who don't have fair
skin obviously in different shades but
if you have fair skin you know that the
struggle is real finding foundation that
actually matches your neck so that's why
this is directed towards pale skin
people if you do not have pale skin this
will also work for you just by a
different shape I am super excited that
this is a collab with my friend Joe here
on YouTube he is also going to be doing
a everyday foundation routine for fair
skin
Joe has some awesome awesome tutorials
he's insanely talented he does these
like crazy transformations that are just
incredible TIFF you want to learn a
thing or two from him I'll leave his
channel down below and you should go
check it out and subscribe if you want
to see what I've been putting on my face
you're in the right place just keep
watching
we're bringing back the leopard robe I'm
down below if you've been with me that
long I should use leopard robe blogs
leave them down below love this thing or
she was acceptable to just wear a
leopard robe every single day outside
okay so what I've been doing to prime my
face is obviously I've already washed it
and moisturize to moisturize I use the
what is even called the body shop tea
tree gel moisturizer I'll leave it down
below and then to prime have been using
the Revlon anti-shine prime balm thing
actually really like this stuff has a
super cool consistency this is new at
the drugstore I use this in previous
shadows moves and mention it in the
drugstore haul picked up the Mario
Badescu rose water a lot of you guys
recommended this as a makeup setting
spray I've actually been using it as a
primer before something about setting my
makeup with like water I don't know I
can't do it but I've been using this
after the bomb stuff to just kind of
like prime all over my face and I really
like it it leaves your face with like
really nice just feels ready for makeup
I don't know how I feel about rose scent
okay so I feel like this is my favorite
foundation combination that I've found
in a while the two products I'm going to
be using our Revlon Colorstay which you
guys know I I'm in love with I do have a
pump on this this is from PDMP and then
I've been mixing it in with the
covergirl Ready Set gorgeous foundation
in the shade 105 I hadn't use this stuff
and probably I don't even know like six
months I have a whole review or first
impression or something on this which
will link down below the finish of this
stuff is incredible it is too dark for
me and I think the 110 is like like it
matches my neck but it makes me look too
ghostly white so I do like to mix in
something a little bit darker and this
these together are just like the most
amazing combination so I just mix about
equal parts of this stuff on the back of
my hand
105 isn't that dark like I'm kind of
surprised this is definitely more of a
full coverage combination so if that's
not what you're about then don't do it
too bright to blend this in I'm just
using my morphe like a giant-ass kabuki
brush on your note this is called so you
can just see that literally covered
everything what I really like about
mixing in the covergirl Ready Set
gorgeous this is definitely more of a
satin finish and just may
the Revlon Colorstay look so much more
natural and just sit better on your face
Revlon Colorstay is super long-lasting
so that these together are just amazing
this is one of those foundation combos
that I feel like looks better after a
couple hours yeah I just need to
redirect it to the store that's close to
my house that lady had the most
interesting combination of accents I've
ever heard
okay anyways I'm just mixing some more
on the back of my hand
what was it even saying I don't remember
oh yeah I got a lot this primer leg
makes your face feel like a baby's butt
trying out the middle part today number
I see middle parts I think of that one
like harder case where the guy would
only murder people with Minar middle
parts my the only one where are you
concealer okay so for concealer I've
been obsessed with the NARS creamy and
it's this radiant creamy concealer in
the shade Chantilly this is amazing and
I'll probably never buy another
concealer the shade is perfect the
consistency is perfect I also mentioned
this in my last outer is let me know by
the way if you guys like the two-part
kind of thing are you just like one
longer video it's easier for me to do
two parts because editing on shadow in
schmoes videos literally takes me about
three or four hours just because there's
so much footage to cut down so if I can
split that into two different videos
it's super helpful because hey you guys
have two videos to watch and B I can
split up editing time but let me know
it's all about you guys I just loved how
much this brightens up the under eye and
it just sets like amazing too bad it's
like $30 it's like all these Physicians
Formula translucent correcting powder I
was using a giant like Ecotools powder
brush for this because I totally
up my ELF one I don't know what happened
where is this I think I threw it out
I've been having really weird brush luck
lately my computer it was apparently
touching one of my brushes and literally
burnt the out of this one like I
don't know
you guys can see that but it's literally
slanted how do I manage to do these
things do I refund and love with my
laura geller balance and brighten powder
and porcelain about a year ago I used
this stuff every day and this was when
my skin was like at its prime I'm just
at the point where I'm like trying to
switch up everything I'm using because I
don't know what's caused me to horribly
break out but I do feel like my skin is
getting better if you guys saw my I
think was the secret life of a youtuber
tag that was like my peak like my skin
not my peak what's worked my skin was
definitely at its worst in that video
and since then as you guys can see like
just everything has gone way down but
anyways this powder is amazing it was
the prettiest like natural finish but it
still gives you coverage yeah like I'm
if you guys can see that but just like
reflects the light beautifully alright
so just pop the brows on like always the
products will be listed down below if
you're curious what I use so on a daily
basis like when I go to work I do not
contour my face because it's just not a
necessary step for me at 6:00 in the
morning but for the sake of the video
I'm gonna come to her because I am gonna
do a whole I look after this so we gotta
get some cheekbones own obviously gonna
use my Holy Grail Sedona lace contour
highlight palette this thing is amazing
you guys have heard me talk about this
like ten thousand times now but I'm kind
of obsessed with it where's my brush so
I'm just gonna mix these two shades
together to create the perfect contour
color so I have also completely re
fallen in love with this this is the wet
and wild blush and pearlescent pink this
is like a dollar or two from the
drugstore I just love how like easily
this stuff blends in and then to set
everything I've been loving the L'Oreal
infallible makeup extender side no I
just remember that I totally had a dream
a couple nights ago that I won like five
hundred bottles of this reality I have
one I'm gonna spray this in my hair
apparently time to take a look we drove
off your head never okay so this is my
final face if you want to see the look
them did on my eyes today I'll have that
in a video
coming up next so make sure you're
subscribed so you don't miss out on that
I'm just super happy that I finally
found a routine that works for me and
stays on all day and looks good and
matches my skin to them so I'd highly
recommend that you guys check out the
products I mentioned in this video make
sure you go check out Joe's channel
because I'm sure he did an awesome
tutorial all of his info will be linked
down below yeah love you guys thanks for
watching and see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
