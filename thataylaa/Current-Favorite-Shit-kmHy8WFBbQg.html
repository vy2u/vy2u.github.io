because as you know I'm pre recording
all of my videos this summer when you're
watching this it won't be summer because
I'm studying abroad if you're confused
click the link down below what is this
hair doing lost my train I thought so
I'm not gonna be able to do monthly
favorites videos most likely unless I
can film over there as August when I'm
filming this and I already filmed my
August favorites I have so much stuff
this month that I have tried out that I
absolutely love I wanted to make a
current favorites video because it'll be
current when you're watching it this
stuff is amazing some of it won't be new
when you're watching it but you'll still
be able to get it so whatever I don't
have that much stuff I just have five or
so products that I'm seriously like
bowls to the walls over bowls to the
walls over my favorite product I've
tried out for my face I guess in a while
like I am amazed with this stuff is the
leo le I think that's how I say it
it's Korean so I don't speak Korean
beyond the solutions bbcream and I got
this because Shannon XO uses is like six
months ago or something I was gonna buy
it but I clicked on her link and it was
like $40.00 on that website and I was
like there's like I just can't justify
spending $40 so I looked on eBay and I
know a lot of eBay's makeup is knockoff
whatever it was eleven dollars holy tits
this stuff I'm like I don't even have
words for how amazing it is all of the
BB creams I've tried in America like
drugstore BB creams I have not been a
fan of on myself this stuff has the most
coverage out of any other BB cream I've
ever tried the consistency is so creamy
I would be comfortable wearing this by
itself just as I had to like run to the
store or something I would just throw
this off if you've seen my foundation
routine which I'll link right here I
have extremely shitty skin to be able to
put on one product and go out the door
for me on my face is huge
and I feel comfortable doing that with
this
stuff it is a BB cream so it's gonna be
good for your skin has all the benefits
that BB creams do ub creams in other
countries generally tend to be better
America hasn't quite got it down yet and
this is fifty milliliters it's a huge
tube I've already ordered my second
bottle because I'm like paranoid that
I'm gonna run out and not have it for a
day it just makes my face makeup like
look flawless I'm wearing it today I
don't know if you guys can like really
tell in there but it's just so smooth
and it feels soft too like my face feels
like a baby's what the next two things
kind of go together and I've mentioned
it in another video I can't remember
which one right now when I'm recording
this this product just came out but you
guys will have already heard about and
everything like that but whatever it's
the color tattoo of Maybelline 24-hour
thing in barely beige and this is I am
like amazed
I have swatches on my blog so I'm not
gonna swatch it right now but the link
will be down below where you can see the
swatches and review and everything this
is a perfect base for your eyeshadow if
you're going for like a nude and
champagne look doesn't crease and I'm
just so happy that they finally came out
with like a nude color he's no one
fucking wears a task blue color tattoos
on their eyes every day I'm surprised
this is limited edition I don't know why
you wouldn't need a permanent nude in
your collection the next thing that kind
of goes with that I'm like obsessed with
this combination
it's the L'Oreal Paris and valuable and
iced latte and it's just this really
pretty champagne shimmery colors what I
have on like the inner third of my eyes
and it just is the prettiest prettiest
champagne color this over top of this is
like dying go to heaven good when I
first wore this eyeshadow look I got
three complements in the same day on my
makeup and that never happens to me
first person that says something was my
dad I don't know that probably says
something if a guy is your eye makeup
and he's not gay next two things are
face products I guess the first one is
the
clean hélène mudpack mask I got this
at Sally's for like I don't know four
dollars or something just the mask that
you leave on in hard ends it turns white
and then when you wash it off your face
is so soft and you can tell that like
all of the oil husband like brought to
the surface definitely need to
moisturize after you use this whenever I
feel like my skin just needs like
starting starting over that didn't make
sense but I use this uh what am i doing
with my life then the next thing this is
kind of a random current favorite but
it's this loo scrubbing glove thing I
kind of forgot about these at my face it
felt like I just got a facial all like
the tiny like blackheads and stuff were
gone it just exfoliates your face super
well use it with any face wash I use it
with my normal like clean and clear deep
action one or whatever it's called the
blue bottle I don't use this every day
because you don't want to exfoliate your
skin every day you want your skin cells
to be able to grow back so I use it
about every four days I would say my
skin just feels amazing after I use use
these I got this at Target for like
three dollars could probably find these
anywhere
and my last oh no not my last second to
last current favorite is this this is
actually a sample size and it's from UM
shit I forget the seller
it's from Essie color pot something like
that no that's wrong I'll put the name
right here it's ladies you're super nice
she sent me all these samples to try out
and there's some stuff that I really
don't like to be honest but this is one
of the products I was like whoa this is
amazing this needs to be talked about
now damn thing open okay so this is a
color pot I think it's called this is
just going off the top of my head so
although information will be like right
here down below it is a cream eyeshadow
this is so gorgeous and pigmented it's
in the color velvet talker and I'm gonna
swatch it for you because it's that
gorgeous alright so
it is so gorgeous and okay this lighting
isn't even doing it justice but you can
kind of see when it shimmers it's like
this gorgeous purple plum color I don't
even know what you would call it but in
the light it has like pink tones in it
and I don't know it's just gorgeous and
it glides on so easy and it feels really
light like this it doesn't feel like a
thick cream or anything like that so
it'd be good for putting other
eyeshadows on top of it definitely this
will be in some tutorials in the future
because look at it why would you not
include it yeah put the Etsy seller down
there now I have purple shit on my hands
I don't know what you do to it the last
thing is this cargo blush and Catalina I
just totally spaced out this is such a
fail okay one two three the next product
is this blush which is by cargo and it's
in the shade Catalina and it's this
gorgeous like kind of bright pink bright
bubblegum pink I guess and it's matte
and it's what's on my cheeks today it
just gives you this really really pretty
like flushed to your face it looks like
healthy and summery without being like
holy shit that chick's wearing blush I
got this off of little black bag I have
an unboxing video I got this in a bag
and I ended up returning the bag but I
love this I only paid like eighteen
dollars for this and it's normally like
25 or 28 or something alright so that
was all of my current favorites it kind
of sucks that I can't do like monthly
favorites for the next nine months
because that's like one of my favorite
videos to make because I like having an
excuse to try out new shit but maybe
I'll try out like Middle Eastern makeup
not that you guys will be able to buy it
but maybe we'll do like a giveaway if
you guys saw this video without editing
right now it'd be all bad
anywho if you want to see where I am
stuff like that
then you can follow my blog which is WWE
telecom thumbs up if you like this and
I'll see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
