both of my feet are asleep
seriously hi girl white girl white girl
white girl you're following my Instagram
then you saw me rave about a few new
products that I found for people with
fair skin so in this video I'm just
going to be mentioning the products I've
been using on an everyday basis its
foundation routine that has been working
super well for me and I feel like I
finally found my foundation routine you
know what I mean I feel like I always
had this child somewhere and I didn't
know where he was but I really loved him
and now he's finally here was that like
socially okay to just compare a
foundation routine to a child this is
actually kind of a sentimental moment
this video is kind of like full circle
for me because back in the day I
actually started watching YouTube
because I couldn't find foundation or
makeup that matched my neck so it's kind
of weird that like now however many
years later I am on the other end you
know kind of weird eating my cheddar
broccoli pasta bowl which is currently
on a mirror as a tray since you needed
to them that so I'm going to be making a
whole other video with all of my
favorite products for fair-skinned
people but this is just going to be my
current routine and at the end of the
video there's going to be a demo of how
I apply this product so first off I just
wanted to get a little bit deep for a
second I might do a whole other Taylor
talks about this because it's something
that has really influenced my life when
I was younger especially but we have
this kind of societal belief about what
is beautiful and what your skin color
should be or what you should look like
and it took me a long time to really
love my fair skin and be proud of it and
own it and I think a lot of that was
that when I started wearing makeup I
couldn't find makeup that actually
matched my skin I went through an orange
stage a vampire stage I remember being
super frustrated and thinking like there
was something wrong with my skin tone
because companies don't make
products light enough for me it took me
a long time to get comfortable with my
fair skin and actually embrace it and
love it I actually preferred to be pale
now rather than being self tanned so if
you guys want to see a Taylor Talks
video about like loving your skin or how
I don't know something like that then
let me know down below because it's
something that I'm passionate about and
I think that it really did influence the
way I view myself and my self-confidence
and things like that anyways that was a
little deep so if you have fair skin or
pale skin I feel you
it is literally horrible trying fine
makeup that actually matches your skin
tone so I hope this is helpful for you
paper white ladies like myself when
finding good foundations for fair skin I
want something that matches my neck but
it's not going to make me look like
 Casper you also have to be
careful with products that oxidize which
means it changes color throughout the
day and turns a little bit darker
because it is no longer going to match
your neck
so what I've been using is these two
foundations maybelline superstay is my
all-time favorite drugstore foundation
if they made this in a light enough
shade I would only use this on my face
every day but because it's not light
enough I mix it in with a Kat Von D
locket tattoo foundation and this is in
the shade l42
few people are commenting saying that
this shade was discontinued if it is
discontinued you can also use the hard
candy glamoflauge concealer that is also
super pale and you can mix that in with
any foundation and it gives you a little
bit more coverage so the thing I like
about mixing these two foundations is
for my skin which is normal combination
at the moment I love the finish of the
maybelline superstay this one is
definitely a mattifying foundation it is
too matte for my personal liking so when
you mix these two together you get the
perfect formula it's also great about
mixing foundations for fair skin is that
you have control over how dark or how
light it is so depending on your skin
tone you can add a little bit more of
the lighter shade whatever floats your
boat
if you've watched any of my get ready
with me Zoar foundation videos which
will be linked down below then you
probably seem to use the covergirl and
Olay simply ages age simple simply
ageless concealer in a jar and this is
in the shade 205 this is the lightest
shade they make obviously I feel like I
don't need to state that anymore since
concealers are usually lighter than
foundation it hasn't been that difficult
to find a good light concealer for me
but I am very picky with the formula of
concealers this one doesn't crease which
is always a plus they don't sell this in
the store anymore which is awful but
there's eBay I get this off of ebay now
I just buy it in bulk I have like 4 in
my drawer and I go through these pretty
quick since I do use it every single day
both of these products I discovered
within the last week and I am completely
completely obsessed with them and they
have been a lifesaver if you have fair
skin you know that finding and powder is
probably harder than finding a good
light foundation just because how does
tend to oxidize on my face when I put a
powder on to set my foundation
it usually darkens the foundation so
even if the foundation matches my neck
when I put a powder on I usually
completely changes the color
I don't like translucent powders because
it doesn't give me the desired coverage
so I found these two powders the first
one is the Physicians Formula mineral
where talc free powder in translucent
and this is actually a correcting powder
which means that it's supposed to cancel
out the red tones in your face I
actually use this to set my foundation
because it is super super light if you
saw my February waves in rejects video
this bad boy was in there you've got
some different colors going on there
what i like to do is just swirl it with
my brush and there you get the perfect
shade what I love about this powder is
the way that it goes on it gives you a
flawless finish doesn't look too powdery
sets everything nicely because it is a
crushing powder it doesn't have oil
controlling property so I find that you
have to like touch up every five hours
when I use this but I don't care because
I'd rather have a powder light enough
for my skin so this has been an absolute
lifesaver to set in your under eye
concealer I always use a powder because
I like my under eye area to be a little
bit lighter than the rest of my face and
give that kind of highlighted look I do
like a powder that is lighter than my
foundation powder so for that I
discovered manic panics virgin pressed
powder and this is a completely
completely that sides better white face
powder there you go so if you are even
paler than I am then you could probably
use this all over your face it isn't a
like translucent white it is full-on
white I don't know how it took me this
long to discover Manic Panic
and their light shades because where
have I been all my life I don't know I
ordered some more of their products so
let me know if you guys want like a
first impressions when those come in the
mail super excited about this though
because now my under-eye area is
actually possible to be lighter than my
face what a concept I got the Manic
Panic powder off of Amazon you can also
get it off of the website it just turned
out to be cheaper on Amazon since I
bought way too much stuff and got free
shipping this does not look very good
okay so that is what I've been using
every day since I got those products
this combo has just been working super
well for me and I hope it helped you
guys so if this video is helpful for you
