routine video which is probably one of
my most requested videos like I always
tell you guys I change out my foundation
literally probably every day but this is
the routine that I go to most I'm
feeling really happy today guys I don't
know what it is I think it's because
I've been literally like on house arrest
sick for four or five days and this is
the first time I'm getting out of the
house in for five days I don't know what
to do with myself right now I'm so happy
that is where I've been not that I've
been away for a long time but I haven't
posted video in like four five days
should we say that again this foundation
routine is for people with difficult
skin to match I don't want to say
fair-skinned because I know other people
have difficult times finding rad
foundation but this is to show you that
you can mix foundations you can mix
drugstore with high-end you can make a
drugstore drugstore you can mix pretty
much anything your heart desires within
the last year I decided to start mixing
foundations and it has literally changed
my foundation world it's a great way to
find the perfect texture for your skin
as well as color for your skin so let me
know down below if you guys want a whole
other video of foundations for people
with fair skin because it has taken me
years to find good foundations that
actually match my neck yeah this is kind
of just walking you through the steps
what ideas should I do this some more
great if you've watched my videos for a
while you know that I have suffered from
acne and I feel so dramatic when I say
like suffered but that's the verb that
you did have acne for a while it is now
starting to clear up and get better
since I've been on Proactiv plus it has
worked pretty well for my skin I do
still have tons of acne scarring and
stuff like on the side of my face which
you'll see in a second but for the most
part my acne has gotten way better here
I still like a full coverage finish
because I have freckles and unevenness
and all of that fun stuff let's just get
into it I feel like I just were
still got the snowman mug still in
denial with the holidays are over I only
had one cup of coffee today and I feel
like I literally had eight I think I'm
just like caffeinated off of life right
now I feel like I started out every
video drinking coffee or hiccuping I
know I was getting some comments about
the sound this is my new camera they put
the microphone underneath the camera and
there's no input for mic plug so I don't
know let me know if you like the better
quality or better sound because my other
camera has better sound and this one has
better quality so let me know I always
start out by cleaning moisturizing my
face and then I do use a primer I use
the L'Oreal magic Lumi primer which is
currently my favorite primer I kind of
always switch them out but I don't know
I just feel like this one actually makes
your makeup stay on longer you know what
a primer is supposed to do basically
since I do have very fair skin it's
really hard to find a foundation that is
right like that actually matches my neck
what's up without making me whoa-ohh
making me look like a ghost or that has
the right consistency that isn't too mad
isn't too dewy so what I do is I mix
them so these are my two favorites to
mix the maybelline superstay in the Kat
Von D lock and touching foundation this
is in the shade L 42 if you're wondering
I'm pretty sure that's the lightest
shade duh and this is also whitening and
I believe this is porcelain ivory I also
have sand beige if they both work if
you're mixing them if you have fair skin
so this is just what I use so basically
I start out with the maybelline
superstay and I just put like a quarter
amount on the back of my hand keep in
mind that I do like a very very full
coverage face and I find that when I use
the maybelline superstay this is what
makes your skin look like skin not like
foundation and because the Kat Von D is
pretty matte I like to add a tiny bit of
like doing this in there and I'm just
putting like literally half a puff of
Kat
on the back of my hand and then what I
do is I just mix it with my fingers and
I can kind of tell now by looking if
it's going to be too dark or too light
so I can already tell this is too dark
for my skin so what I'm going to do is
add a tiny bit more of the Kat Von D
because that is lighter I don't know
it's just kind of practice you know your
skin color and when you do this every
day you if you don't know what you
figure it out
start by dabbing whatever was on my
finger from mixing onto my face and then
I take my flat top kabuki brush and I
just stipple it evenly on the back of my
hand and then kind of start working that
into my skin
and when I apply my foundation I do like
to kind of Pat it before blending it I
think that gets into the skin better and
gives you more coverage because the
maybelline superstay is in here you
don't have to work too fast this
foundation doesn't dry very quickly the
Kat Von D does so you get kind of I
don't know have this weird setup right
now because I just got a new tripod and
it is like ginormous and I don't know
why I bought it but I did and so now I'm
standing I kind of feel like whenever I
stand in film I have more energy does
that happen anyone else like I remember
I used to when I first started youtube I
used to always stand when I filmed my
videos this is turning into like a total
doing the same thing they're tiny bit
more mixing it is oh yeah so when I
first started youtube I used to always
stand when I filmed my videos because I
don't know why actually I started doing
that but I don't know I just feel like I
have more hey you know what I mean
people don't realize that you have to be
in a total mood when you film videos I
find when my videos turn out totally
different when I tell them first thing
in the morning before I have like human
interaction and then at the end of the
day so I kind of just like to go over
everything because I do like I said like
more coverage and I'm just taking
whatever is left on my hand and blending
that out okay so now that we have the
foundation on kind of our first layer I
like to go in with my concealer I've
been switching it up lately either use
the Maybelline instant age rewind
concealer or my all-time favorite which
is the covergirl and Olay concealer in a
jar and this is 205 the lightest shade
they did just continue this but I found
it on eBay gotta love you babe I'm going
to be using that today I like to apply
my concealer with my finger I think it
just applies best like that and I'm a
kind of what hair my same right now and
I like to make an upside down kind of
- she in triangle with my concealer and
then Pat it into the skin
you can just see it between this side
and this side how much of a difference
concealer makes on your face
sometimes if I want more of a
highlighted look I'll bring this down
the bridge of my nose and then a little
bit on my chin for it powder to set the
under-eye area is the Rimmel stay matte
powder this stuff breaks me out like no
other if I use it all over my face but I
like to set it just in the under eye
area and I'm using the elf flat top
kabuki brush for this you can get it at
Target or online and I'm literally just
patting this on top of the concealer and
this is going to prevent creasing and it
will make your concealer stay on that's
the rest of my face I kind of always
switch out my powder but the one I've
been loving lately because it doesn't
break me out and I feel like my skin has
actually improved while using this is
the Physicians Formula mineral where
telc free face powder and this is in
translucent light clearly I've hit pan
been using it a lot so it's exciting
when you hit can you apply this I just
use a big powder brush and this is from
the ebay brush set that I always talk
about literally probably my favorite
brushes that I have ever used ever super
affordable I'll leave the link down
below no I didn't get sent it no I don't
get paid
to say that I honestly really love this
brush then the only thing with this
powder is that it does oxidize a little
bit throughout the day which means that
it turns a little bit darker oh I'm
gonna do some bronzing and blushing
because look at this face we need a
little bit of blush in my life I'm using
the bronzer from Sephora I don't even
know what shade I think that says
Bahamas it's currently my favorite
bronzer line this in the contour of my
face so if you make a fish face this
line right there that's created that's
where you want to apply your bronzer
then I also like to bring it up to the
top of my forehead a little bit just to
give some more warmth to the face so
I've been reaching for pretty much every
day is the one-mile color icon blush in
pearlescent pink and I'm just going to
apply this to the apples of my cheeks a
little bit above where we just applied
that bronzer and then kind of blend
everything together and the brush I'm
using is by elf and it's the complexion
brush
okay then my favorite part of my
foundation routine lately I've been all
about the dewy skin highlighted look and
to achieve that my favorite product is
the mary lou manizer highlight by the
balm you can give this on Outlook
Outlook whatever the links down below
are sale site they have awesome deals on
makeup and some good brands on there and
you can get it for super cheap that is
where I got mine so the brush I use to
apply this is also in the ebay brush set
it is a tapered highlighter brush looks
exactly like the Sigma one but it's two
dollars instead of fifteen this is a
super pigmented highlighter so I
literally just lightly tap my brush once
and then we're going to apply it above
the blush on our cheekbones down the
center of her face in the Cupid's bow
and this just adds so much to your face
I feel like it makes everything look
more natural in a way because you don't
look one-dimensional in math
if you tend to get really oily
throughout the day I wouldn't put a
highlighter in your t-zone because it's
going to accentuate that but when you're
really dry like me and you need that
extra shine to make it look like you're
not wearing full caked face of makeup
then you'll love this then to set
everything in before I applied the rest
of my makeup I use the Urban Decay chill
makeup setting spray
I like the all-nighter better it's
basically the same thing
this isn't chilling at all I don't know
why they call it that I don't know how
many pumps that was I usually do about
six I feel like just I don't know
whatever covers my face I'm going to go
apply the rest of the makeup I'm getting
like a leg workout right now I'm
literally in like a mid squat position
right now I'm going to apply the rest of
my makeup and I will be back okay so I
now have the rest of my makeup on I'm
just going to class so sorry can give
you something more exciting but comment
