are over red and gold probably going to
watch someone tonight where the heck did
December go
all right so today we're going to be
talking about my current favorite
skincare product
the last few months have gotten lots of
questions from you guys about what I've
changed you've noticed my skin kind of
clearing up a little bit so today I'm
telling you everything this is what I've
been doing differently lately FS cystic
acne now for years it kind of goes on
and off clears up and then gets bad
again I'm gonna leave my acting related
videos down below I'm not going to go in
depth about my skin history or anything
like that in this video before we jump
into the products I didn't want to say
or obviously go to the dermatologist I
have considered going on accutane in the
past and it's still not off the table
for me just because my skin really goes
in major phases right now my skin is
pretty dang good for me but just a
couple weeks ago I had major Assisting
breakouts again on my chin area
so it does really fluctuate everyone in
the comments on these videos likes to be
a dermatologist and I always appreciate
your project recommendations and help
but just know that I have tried a lot of
different medications I've tried a lot
of different products I do go to the
dermatologist and this is just what I'm
currently doing this is what's working
for my skin everyone's skin is so
different and reacts differently to
different products so just keep that in
mind and I have changed two major things
in my lifestyle I guess the first one is
that I went off of birth control pills
I'm not telling you to go off of birth
control pills you and your doctor know
your body best I actually went off of
them for other health reasons and notice
that when I did my skin cleared up a lot
it could have just been the pills that I
was using in the hormone levels and
everything but for me I noticed a big
difference in my skin when I went off of
birth control pills and I was probably
want to say about six months ago
some people's skin totally cleared up
when they go on birth control pills mine
had kind of the reverse effect that is a
big change with my skin the other one
I've made a lot of dietary changes not
for my skin necessarily but for my
migraines and that is I've been gluten
free for two months now along with soda
kind of just being more aware of
inflammatory foods not getting into my
whole body neck migraine issues but
obviously what you put in your body does
affect your skin those are two main
things outside of the products that I'm
about to mention one of these products
I'm going to mention is my holy grail
skin care products lately that I do
played a big part in clearing out my
skin actually don't have a whole lot of
products here to talk about I've kind of
minimott minimalized great word choice
there kind of been trying to reduce the
amount of products I'm putting on my
skin and just finding ones that I feel
like really suit my skin in this video
I'm not mentioning face masks because I
just did an entire video on my favorite
pamper products face masks teeth
whitening all that kind of stuff but
planning on filming this video without
foundation on like I normally do in my
skincare videos but it is 4 o'clock
right now when I filming this and the
entire first half the day I was in bed
with the migraine and half of my face is
totally red and splotchy right now so
I'm going to insert some footage of my
skin in natural lighting so you can
really see the texture and acne and acne
scarring and everything unfortunately
today was my only day to film this video
but obviously since this is a skincare
video I want you to be able to see my
skin the first thing I do at night is
take off my makeup with makeup remover
wipes for years I've been using the blue
Neutrogena whites and I recently
discovered the CVS brand Beauty 360
these are the ones that are supposed to
be comparable to the Neutrogena wipes
and these are pretty much exactly the
same I almost like these a little bit
better and these are a few bucks cheaper
if you want to save some money I use
these all over my face and for removing
my waterproof eye makeup I really have
makeup this being stubborn or like
liquid lipstick that won't come up with
these I'll go in with my Neutrogena
oil cleansing oil everything I talked
about we linked down below in the
description box you take off everything
I really sensitive eyes and these don't
burn my eyes at all the next thing I do
is go in with my face wash and cleansing
tool so face wash I use is a polished
choice clear pore normalizing cleanser
it says this is for blemish prone skin
the best way I can describe this is the
most basic gel cleanser it's clear in
color it sends us 100% fragrance free
and has no added diet that has a really
faint scent to it doesn't smell bad at
all
and that night I literally just force
this right on to my brush and this brush
I've been using for a couple months now
and this is the vanity planet ultimate
skin spa system and it comes with box a
famous box because look at this Tiffany
blue color get the actual tool in here
obviously and then you get three
different brushes one day I love for my
skin and the worst the best is this
silicone brush head is great
it's supposed to be the daily cleansing
brush and then this one is the
exfoliating brush head out of the three
the silicon one is definitely the most
gentle and this is my favorite so daily
cleansing one for my skin was too harsh
some reason before I started using this
I thought it was going to hate the
silicone brush head just because I don't
know there's something about the
silicone that doesn't appeal to me at
all but when you actually use this and
put this on your skin it feels totally
different than I thought it was going to
you do get a deep clean with this it's
going to help take off your makeup
unclog your pores but it doesn't have
that super harsh feel to it
this is best if you have acne prone skin
because it doesn't build up any bacteria
like normal brush heads since it is
silicone it has a couple different
speeds on it I usually just go in with
the first one the second one is a little
bit faster and then it just turns it off
the only thing you got to watch out for
is your hair I either put on a headband
or like hold back all of my baby hairs
or else this thing will like totally
suck it up this skins bus system is
normally 125 bucks but I do have a 70
percent off coupon for you guys if you
click on the link download description
box it will knock down this product to
38 bucks which I feel like it's a pretty
good deal for three different brush
heads this video is in collaboration
with vanity planet so thank you to them
for working with me on this video and
also for hooking you guys up with the
discount code you guys know I only work
with brands and products that I actually
believe in and use and love or else we
won't be here and I want to be
mentioning this so after I cleanse my
face and when I use that thing I totally
notice the difference because the next
up is toner you're curious try half of
your face with the tool and half about
the edge of a sentence 15 times this is
going to be the winner when you go in
with your toner cotton pad you'll see
that decide they use the brush on has
less makeup on it left over then decide
that you didn't go on to toner I have
two different toners that I use kind of
just depending on what I feel like my
skin needs this one is totally empty I
just finished this off this is the body
shop tea tree skin clearing toner I
don't know if this really helped my ask
me at all but I do like this and I don't
think it makes my skin worse it does
take off any leftover residue that's on
my face and it likes to teach recent
because of the tea tree it has kind of
like a cooling effect to it I really
like to smell this and it is really
refreshing the other one that I switched
between which I feel like really helps
my skin texture if you have a lot of
little bumps on your skin that you just
can't get to get away
can't get to get away can't get away
this polish way skin perfecting
2% BHA liquid sell salt acid product is
great this gives you the prettiest flow
to your face I've mentioned this and the
cleanser in another skincare routine
video past one all the choices on this
brands that you can really trust the
ingredients I love this for putting on
underneath my makeup or if I'm having a
day where I just don't want to wear a
foundation or anything I'll put this on
because it gives your skin the prettiest
glow I don't use this one every night I
probably use this twice two to three
times a week in this the rest of the
night so this next product I swear by I
think this has made a huge difference in
my skin and my acne this is one of those
products that is pricey but we're
talking about your skin and for me if I
can find a product that works for me
it's worth the money so this is the Olay
Henriksen invigorating night treatment
this is a overnight resurfacer aah a
complex I'm down to like here in this
bottle right now I've been using this
for I don't even know now I want to say
six or seven months probably I think I
started using this right around the time
that it went off of birth control when I
get the day using this stuff I notice
the difference in my skin don't know
what magic is going on in this product
but it literally stops my breakouts
before they totally come to the surface
even with speed big underneath the skin
cystic acne they just never totally come
to the surface this was recommended by
one of you guys a while ago and I am so
happy to take the stuff because I really
feel like this has made the world of
difference for my skin after trying this
I've tried a few other Ola Hendrickson
products and I haven't been totally as
well by them as hoping that's going to
be one of those things where my skin
just loves everything by the brand but
unfortunately that is not the case but
this product really helps me out so
before going in with moisturizer I
usually let's just sit on my skin for
about 20 minutes to an hour sometimes
we'll just put this on and go finish up
things around the house and then come
back and put on a moisturizer so we like
a couple hours later so I definitely
like to let that totally sink into my
skin this product isn't drying at all
some nights if I forget to put on a
moisturizer and I wake up my skin feels
nice and plump and moisturize it doesn't
feel dry at all or anything so I do try
and go in with a moisturizer every night
since using up my bead nigma moisturizer
which I really do love it's like that
thick thick cream and my skin reacts
really well to that I don't have a
moisturizer that I am like totally in
love with right now because you have any
good night
I'm moisturizer recommendations like fit
creams I really like the super thick
ones let me know down below because that
is something that I'm still on the hunt
for this one I like it's not a thick
cream whatsoever but I can use this at
night and in the morning this is a
belief true cream aqua balm this really
does help moisturize the skin it has a
really nice pretty color to it as the
same like tiffany blue color to it I
don't know why I'm so drawn to this
color smells really nice and refreshing
the scent isn't too overpowering this is
a super super lightweight gel
moisturizer you can use this underneath
makeup you can use it at night by the
way I have combination skin and colleges
as beginning so most of you guys know if
you watch any of my foundation videos
even though the B enigma is super pricey
I think I might actually just repurchase
that because I do really love that
moisturizers like I said let me know
your favorites down below I actually
wanted to mention this because this
isn't technically like a skincare
product but if you have acne face
primers can be one of those things that
if you have acne or sensitive skin
certain face primers ingredients in them
can really irritate your skin and this
is one of the few base primers I found
that does not irritate my skin and I
actually really kind of helps my skin
this is the jouer anti blemish matte
primer as it says l still have acne in
it kind of like a treatment and a face
primer in one it's silicone free oil
free hypoallergenic and paraben free so
it doesn't have that silicon feel to it
like a lot of face for my food this is
more of like a moisturizing kind of
primer I want to throw this in since
I've gone through two two so this now
I'm almost out of this one so those are
all the products that I use on a regular
basis obviously now and then I'll try
different face oils and moisturizers and
kind of switch up certain products but
for the most part these are like the
ones that have stayed studies throughout
the last few months so I hope that was
helpful for you guys if you like this
video make sure you give it a thumbs up

radio family and subscribe I upload
