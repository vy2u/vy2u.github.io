feel confident I done
I feel confident because I'm not wearing
any of this crap how do you know it's
very do it so we're going to go check
out and then head back home and we're
doing a major makeover and miss let me
started you up started
patience is a virtue alright so we just
win the CVS we're back at home to my on
your on okay just went to CVS with my
young student the Tayla I'm turning it
over to her to let her use all the
products that I've selected from around
the world around the world around the
world make it up with the Taylor take it
thank you for that grand introduction
you guys I have no makeup on I have a
tiny bit of concealer so he did get a
foundation he didn't give me a face
primer but does okay that's not super
necessary
usually put on a primer before the
and there's no setting team ever I want
to use first of concealer and primer
eyes the same thing top lip if you
haven't seen we did a dad does my
voiceover video so I'm gonna link that
over here in a little eyes you missed
that you got me the Revlon color stay in
the shade 110 okay
that's a spray this yes this is a pump
there we go we have kind of a janky set
up right now but I have a travel light
so hopefully this has enough lighting
I'm in my parents bathroom right now in
San Diego by the way I actually have a
video comparing the new Revlon Colorstay
formula to the old one like so I'm
actually like this better than the old
formula see you yeah this is your
favorite what do you do after a
foundation does some kind of block out
the roost block out kinda see what set
concealer have you got the covergirl
clean invisible concealer in the shade
115 I actually think I might have used
this in the hidden drugstore products
video if this was a concealer so it was
pretty horrible yeah I think this was
the shitty one I think this dries really
quickly it's a bit dark not bad not good
okay she got a few am i pasted it was
good for it I don't feel like I didn't
actually get a whole lot of coverage of
that at all I think I would have got
more coverage just going in with the
foundation but I agree should I do that
yeah everything is my finger dab a
little bit under the eyes yeah this way
brighter look at that okay so then I'm
going to go in with powder you got me
the L'Oreal True Match powder in the
shade porcelain I think I actually have
this I'm going to use this to set my
under eyes and my face guess down below
in the comments how much you think all
this was and I'll tell you guys at the
end it is ridiculous as most of the
drugstore is now a good at you we can
never draw on Iraq are you hosting this
raffle I mean use a bigger brush and
just set my whole face and I'm Mac
sizzles down your neck just as I voice
over again let's do eyebrows so we got
me the Maybelline brow define and fill
duo actually have never tried this you
got the right shade you got deep brown
good job oh cool okay so we have one
retractable pencil and what is this so
there's actually a powder in here and I
have permanent brows on but I do usually
like to fill in my brows just because
when I put on foundation it usually
covers a little bit these over you're
like doing lunges or something actually
dad out of all the Foundation's you
could have picked you picked a really
good one that's like one of the best
drawer
store foundations so you actually picked
up a really good contour blush and when
you're going to put the angles of your
draw yes
mind you it is blending out really
easily go in with some Rouge here so
okay I'm gonna attempt to use the
highlight in this thing because it's the
only thing I have to highlight with that
looks pretty matte actually there's like
a tiny bit of a sheen to it might look
different once it's actually on the face
it's a dark highlight by my people to
actually use such a tiny bit of glitter
in this lightest shade in the eyeshadow
palette now that one's actually pretty
massive just a few specks of glitter in
there mix them oh that works better I'm
gonna go back in with the concealer and
a prime my eyes what kind of eye shadow
look are you feelin smoky or more
natural oh yeah that's a lot of garbage
is great this is the palette that he got
I think is actually new is on the end
cap thing this is the Rimmel magnifiers
shadow I haven't tried this and I
haven't heard anything about this so
it's kind of exciting we're spending on
with that peach shade popping this in
the crease I'm gonna go in with that
green shade of blue that looks pretty
somebody's eye finger just set that
right on the lid they have a nice matte
brown shade right here trying to put
that into the crease little bit rise in
the crease and all of us makeup artist
know sometimes we have to do it in
different situations under different
conditions and you have to deck
Oaksterdam you look at the lip colors
probably looked at what we're working
with first I don't think a one liner
thick because I'm space okay this green
isn't doing a whole lot for me on the
lid so I'm going to try and put that
actually has a little bit of this purple
I'm going to wet it to see if we can get
it a little bit more metallic I'm going
to go to that setting spray in the
purple shadow it's going to press that
on the lid I like the matte shades in
here the shimmery ones I'm not getting a
whole lot of pop from let's do a liner
first and then I'll do the lower lash
line to see what I need so this is the
eyeliner he picked out this is the
Maybelline master duo we got a
two-in-one
glossy liquid liner
- how'd you get the dual tip I'm very
confused I need to look at this
packaging I totally destroyed the
instructions on the back of here I have
no idea how this is supposed to be a
dual tip it just looks like kind of a
ball applicator on the end almost yeah I
don't know man
we're just going to go in whoa what is
happening why is he vacuuming right now
I'd be doing this totally wrong right
now but this is not the easiest to work
with this tip I'm in is a little bit
bizarre this is a dead burnt clip it
there's like a little ball thing on the
end yeah yeah yeah go control you want
to see that a little yeah fine - oh yeah
yes was cheating I don't know okay well
he's doing that let's do the lower
lashline I'm actually going to go back
in with that bronzer shade this warm
brown shade right here so for my inner
corner I'm going to take that lightest
shade how'd it go good had a little
court to look at why oh yeah so you just
cut off the end that was good for the
wing is not happening so I'm going to
take my eyeshadow brush and just smudge
this out a little bit we'll still let
Holly happy yes exactly
not fine that even on the first wife it
really doesn't go on take it all there's
a black eyeshadow in this palette right
here it has a bit of glitter in it but
I'm just going to smoke out that top
eyeliner
all right we're going for kind of a
grungy look what's going with mascara he
got the Revlon volume and length
magnified mascara I've actually never
tried this I like this packaging though
looks like it has a nice fluffy wand
just chick towards me
sighs I know heavy on the eyeshadows and
I got me a smoky palette this is the lip
palette that he got me just knew its
limit edition love is in the air it
actually looks exactly like one of those
things that you find out like Claire's
price was right he says I think you got
slim because there's a lot of different
options in here it's called there oh
good it actually comes with a brush so
I'm going to be using Mac's I don't have
a lip brush with me to apply these I
kind of do more of a nude I don't have a
lip liner actually first I'm going to
try out this darker nude right here wow
this is like a pink it's not expecting
that I'm gonna try those shade one over
it's like a little bit darker
okay and that one's even more pink meat
raspberry one I'm just going to mix them
all something I'm feeling this lip color
at all
little right I'm going to put some eye
shadow Evers I think yeah we got a
tongues down I'm going to go in with the
shade that we put in our transition
right here and see what happens
I'm going to take a little bit of the
brown shadow okay that was the wrong
choice remover now that we have the
darkness going and go back in with the
lip palette to kind of smooth everything
out all these pull very pink tones there
you go all right I think that's as good
as we're gonna get on lips right there
so I think that's everything I'm going
to set everything off with some setting
spray this stuff by the way is 18 bucks
at CVS now okay so this is a final look
thank you I think overall I give about
an eight and a half nine everything good
lips are a little cheesy eyeliners very
low-key yellow iron yeah that goes rad
you take that back not after we chopped
it happened during what we started with
and how we did it and how much should we
spend oh yeah so make sure your comments
are down below your guesses are in
expense I got a couple of her things
so without that stuff we spent about 90
95 bucks on all this so I hope you guys
