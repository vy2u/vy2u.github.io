artists is very temperamental is a no
like that what is the same change just
part of things to my nose get look I'm
getting a little light on me there your
face is not the focus with us you're
interesting since you get all that stuff
in there right you're not telling me
what I call us and all these brushes you
heard the video director throw that I'm
Rick Nolan are we recording yeah we're
over here we are in beautiful Lake Tahoe
man I gotta get anxious if it started
and I was cut it out
all right so today we're going to be
doing the dad does my makeup challenge
video here's dad he's made us debut and
a few other videos I'm gonna link them
down below if you guys missed it but
we're in Tahoe when you guys are seeing
this we just went to the lake
I got clogged by our dogs you're gonna
get to cover that up yep covering
everything up I'm wearing a swimsuit
haven't showered this is going to be a
disaster
yeah wind blowing in the background it's
a mountain day and won't let you know
right away if anything you see that I'm
wearing I'm going to have links at the
end of the video for all my outfit
everything I'm going to link it down
below like we always do he actually has
it really easy because I only have my
travel makeup bag here since I'm not at
home clearly so options are fairly
limited and then I have all the brushes
laid out right here you can go to town I
don't really have I have whatever I had
on some this morning leftover so okay
yeah she says that I'm looking at like
200 items in a bag I have no idea but
I'm going to start looking and here we
go I want 18,000 likes at the end we got
to beat my prior videos so let's keep it
going let me hear the man roll it I'm
looking at 50 can't do that yeah I want
to find base coat blush I remember that
from one of my prior videos on your
right the light is kind of better at
this okay oh we're still recording we
just suggested the light because we're
getting blinded for the window so this
is a finishing powder I know that's not
the one I know I want to start with what
I call a base or foundation something
that's going to be the block out this
has eyelashes stuck on it I'm going to
try some of these I very experienced
well how do you look at all your brush
options not definitely I don't have
backup brushes views for the next few
days so anything masculine no we're not
doing that oh I'm getting hot don't lie
you're looking at this is a little brush
that I remember she want me to dampen I
expected them to happen yeah or dampen
it ever
it says finishing powder but that I know
you I'm putting that on first because I
do I'm putting this in here and tap tap
deaf deaf guy trying a little bit my arm
ooh I like that
that's I
he's test first myself before I put on
any mic Oh excellent
okay here we go we're wrong now I got
accept that that decision set my foot
cramping turn the other way please
oh wait oh the dog scratches are gone
already if you're doing powder first
before anything oh yeah doing powder
about time this is a block outsider
please don't speak this way you put
around your eyes kind of make you look
like a clown I remember that so we did
the dad does my voiceover video and then
also dad's eyes my makeup so you have
like kind of a basic ideas oh no idea
whatsoever what I'm doing here a pretty
confident before you know I was better
when I look at the suitcase full of
perfect stuff with nothing on it that
says what it is not like your tester arm
yeah dude on my arm first and if it
works in my arm it's good on her okay
we're not going to go crazy on
everything here today oh there's a I
shadow needs a little more before we go
to the eyes I think is hilum ID mat 12
very good product but I'm not sure where
we could use that I don't know what this
is but it isn't a sponge again yeah okay
you're Shay go to the brush I think I
should use a brush on it that a good
brush I hear this one looks okay this
what's your strategy here like this is
an all-over face powder or this is a
cover-up with the the base the
foundation you get in with the
foundation and we add in layers is I
always we know in the makeup business
and as we add we block out we build up
and turn the other way please you've got
a lot of natural color underneath from
being out in the Sun and Lake Tahoe
that's that light stuff I don't know if
I want to go to that it's a pan stick
ooh this could be trouble
Oh a little red spot right there it
doesn't have yeah this is it's like put
a crane on where you for you mrs. hire
me all over face yeah I don't like that
at all that's too heavy
oh yeah get it I really like this this
so far has been my best product and I
don't know what it is but it's very good
I'm going right away to some lip stuff
