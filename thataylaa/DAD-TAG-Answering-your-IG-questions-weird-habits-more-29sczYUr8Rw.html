cherry Lee school says have you believed
in your daughter since she started
making YouTube videos are you afraid of
potential stalkers you might get through
YouTube no she handles herself pretty
well and I think she's doing a great job
on YouTube and they did not believe in
me since I started doing into well no I
had a very beginning in high school it
was a little questionable it's all good
good good Rihanna rock says does he
watch your videos yes I watch her videos
not every one of them he watches them my
mom doesn't watch him at all how does he
feel about your personal makeup style
interesting yes I give me so much for my
foundation being Orange I like the

of my soccer team saw her Nicole I ever
made was for the wrong team and I didn't
know how to play soccer okay how did
your dad think of the name Taylor yeah
we sat there her mom and I sat there and
dr. aunt most potential dog no
absolutely not no we just like Taylor

would watch every day when she was
little if so what was it absolutely I
love you Barney and our third and Arthur
yes what is the best memory you have
from being a dad deal 8:28 says well
that's a hard one
Taylor graduating high school college
are all good memories I never think of
best of anything because there's so many
good times that I think that we've
happened what makes you a most proud of
Taylor says Nicole and Miller to 590
definitely that Taylor's out on her own
living in the world doing everything on
our own whether it's money eating living
doing everything no it's good that
you're totally independent
Emily loved xxx three says did Taylor
enjoy burritos as a kid absolutely
probably a friend time she got her first
baby teeth did you always know it that
you wanted a burrito baby baby no baby I
have no idea what's a baby don't know
the very desert what does your dad think
about you doing YouTube videos I know
some parents are afraid of social media
I have no fear of it a turn like I say
handles herself really well yeah I think
it'd be also a lot different now than
when someone starting as like a teenager
when they're like younger a lot of
parents hate that people get so much to
get on YouTube yeah when I read a few
negative comments on years ago those
people don't know what they're talking
about boy and yeah Jamie Kirby says
weirdest thing he remembers you doing as
a child wearing headbands everyday oh
yeah
during high school yeah yes hay bale and
white had been fetish couldn't leave the
house with a friggin head
wasn't even on my hair it was like yeah
it was like a sweat gun she would not
leave that house this is gonna be good I
can tell already yeah I mean little
spoon says do you think Taylor looks
more like you or her mom she looks like
more like the mom's side of the family I
think really Kwami I looked at your
guys's photo yesterday and he was like
well you look exactly like your dad
really yeah yeah I feel like I get both
yeah both which do you think her
personality is more like mine yeah yeah
you do you've got humor and wit and
brains for me yeah my artistic
definitely way more emotional for Mom
when finding out your family was having
a girl me what future did you picture
her having is she doing beyond expected
I never I never anticipated or projected
I always wanting you to be successful
and happy and I think you're both so I
think that's really cool what's his
favorite dad joke favorite dad joke I
know you totally up that dress but
they're more stories he has his 10
stories that he tells to everyone and
very lengthly every bar that we don't he
has to tell them about his Tino
Martinez I may be a b a b c e r98 says
how does Taylor had a lot of boyfriends
did you like any of them
I like the majority of Taylor's
boyfriends but no her boyfriends have
all been very enjoyable down to earth I
had more boyfriends in high school and
like growing up than I have in the past
two years true in a slump
you'd be watching many times single
taser what is your biggest hope or fear
of your daughter's life well it's the
first your biggest hope biggest hope is
that she continues in your career meet
somebody and settles down has a family
and enjoys life which I think she's
doing well biggest fear I mean this is
real negative it would be something bad
happened an accident or something like
that we kind of already answered this
but how does he feel about the attention
you get from YouTube videos how does he
feel about the hate I don't like when
somebody writes a negative comment
especially when they really some of them
are very odd but also I ignore those I
don't even look at those anymore to tell
you the truth yeah I don't really either
I just delete it and kind of move on how
strict where the dating rules and
restrictions growing up says your girl
Jason I was I was able to like date
anyone it was middle of the road I don't
think it really was an issue for us or
for you yeah I think we both trusted
each other yeah if that's a good way to
put it
what is one thing that you and Taylor
did together growing up that you would
recommend other dads to do with their
daughters that's a good question that
was from Caitlin Michaela okay and I
forgot about this before though we did a
favorite times together and it's every
time mom would go away we'd go to
Disneyland spend the weekend and just
hang out with driving we talked about
remember yeah just hard
we have good times together just you and
I I think that's good what would you
recommend other dads do with their
daughters spend doing one-on-one time it
is be open and honest and yeah and time
and listen oh this is good one is there
anything that secretly annoys you about
your dad slash daughter so he says about
each other oh really yeah okay you do
first oh I know sometimes they don't let
me just speak for myself like if we're
in a restaurant or something always be
like oh yeah she's hungry she she needs
some bread only bothers me about tailors
and this the truth is her taking care of
herself with her body and exercise
eating things that she could be doing in
my opinion for herself that she doesn't
do does he have a nickname for you tase
tase tase what both my parents
I miss my family yeah what is something
you truly love about your dad / daughter
I love just how independent confident
she is in her life and her handling her
herself which at this age is an
incredible thing that's everything
