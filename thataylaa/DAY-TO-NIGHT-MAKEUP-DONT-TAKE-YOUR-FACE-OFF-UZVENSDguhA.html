to night kind of situation I don't think
I've ever done a day tonight look before
I just got home from work and this is
what my makeup looks like after like
nine hours of work I feel like it's
always kind of a struggle when you go
out after you have a full face sometimes
it can be tricky to figure out how to
make your face look good with the same
makeup on so these are just some things
that I do and some tips I have for you
guys all right so since I am looking a
little bit oily in my t-zone area I'm
just gonna take this Laura Mercier
setting powder I've only used this one
so far I can't tell if it broke me out
or not a little bit I've heard a ton of
people rave about this lately so I've
been trying it out it comes with a
little poof thing that actually looks
pretty nice we're just gonna put a
little bit the powder over top whew and
anywhere that we're looking a little bit
too shiny if you put a powder over top I
would make sure that it's one that's
super finely milled so it doesn't look
cakey a lot of times when you touch-up
foundation it can make it look almost
worse I'm just a little bit kicked up so
as you can see that just kind of
mattified everything a little bit it
went pretty hard on the contour today so
I think I'm going to leave the contour
if you didn't contour your face in the
morning you can definitely go in and
just sculpt out your cheekbones a little
bit I used my favorite it cosmetics my
sculptor face palette which is like Holy
Grail if you liked my blush faded a tiny
bit so I'm gonna go back in this morning
I used a Tarte adored blush and where's
my blush brush seriously are you wet
definitely not wearing a bra right now
and it feels fantastic Oh in the
bag where it's supposed to be so I'm
just gonna put a tiny bit more of this
on the cheeks if you've been following
my Instagram I attempted to dye my hair
blue black again and it's hard to tell
in this lighting by outside it
definitely looks more blue there's like
a little bit of a blue tone to it now
let me know if you guys would want a
video on how to go from black to blue
black no reasoning so I don't have
anything on my eyes right now except
mascara and I am wearing Maybelline
falsies which I've like
fallen in love with that mascara is
freaking amazing it just makes your
lashes look so nice and I don't feel
like I really have to wear eyeliner with
it so I'm just gonna put a tiny bit of
Mac's painterly paint-pot to prime the
eyes what's new with you guys how's life
I always want to know where you guys are
from I wish we could like talk leave a
comment down below and let me know where
you're from I feel like there's a lot of
people who watch from California is
actually a decent amount of people in
the Seattle area which is cool you
definitely want to put some kind of eye
primer or base on your eyes if you're
going out because we want our eye shadow
to be looking good all night long and
I'm gonna go in with this morphe palette
I haven't used this yet it's a 35u
palette it looks like this so there's
some fun colors in here but I don't
think I'm gonna use any of them I think
I'm just gonna go in with the neutral
boring ones this is just kind of what
I'm feeling right now
this shade right here it looks beautiful
so I'm just gonna go in with a fluffy
brush and we're gonna blend this into
the crease she assumed you guys in so I
feel like we haven't like talked in a
while so I'm just gonna give you guys a
little bit of a life update right now I
am moving apartments again I'm still
staying in Seattle I'm actually staying
in the same neighborhood because I
freaking love it three people in a
two-bedroom just wasn't gonna work out
for another year so my best friend is
actually moving closer to her work and
then me and my other roommate are
staying together it'll be weird because
it's the first time I haven't lived with
Rach in like four years
but I think it'll also be fun because
then we can like sleep over each others
house and it'll just be fun to like do
something different I guess no no that's
what I'm looking at it we did find a new
apartment which I'm really excited about
and I move in July 7 so it's super soon
and I'm gonna be out of town for work
for like every other weekend
so I basically have like a way to move
everything over and move into the new
place I'm going to be vlogging as much
as it as much as it I'm gonna try to
vlog as much as I can it's always hard
when you're like in the moment and
trying to get done to remember to
like whip out a camera there's some
super pretty popery red colors in here I
think I'm gonna go in with these too so
I'm just going to take my finger
oh my god this is beautiful hell yeah
this reminds me of like clay in a good
way
this feels super soft and it's like
blending out really nicely I haven't
used morphe shadows in probably like a
year I don't know why I just never go
for like the big palettes if you get
shadow on your lashes as you're doing
this don't worry about it because we're
gonna go in with mascara and falsies so
it's all good then I'm gonna go in with
that light shade that was right next to
it
I'm just gonna pop this right in the
center like it just almost put myself in
a ball this one isn't as pigmented just
giving it kind of like an orange II
thing so JK we're actually gonna go in
with this light gold shade right here
what there we go
just got to pile it on so the apartment
is two bedrooms it has hardwood floors
except in the bedrooms if the living
room is frickin huge
has a gym downstairs go to the gym with
a gym in my apartment building we have
an issue I'm just gonna pack on this
cool toned brown color it's not really
as dark as I want it and there's not
really any other deep brown matte colors
in this palette so I'm gonna go in with
the cosmetics palette and take the shade
Java right here then whatever is left
over on the brush I'm blending inwards
in the crease I'm gonna be painting all
of the walls white which I am freakin
stoked for because I literally can't
stand tan walls like they make me cringe
I really need to work on my desk area
and like make up organization because
right now it's just out of control
I do not have enough space this is just
a matte tan shade and we're gonna put
this under the brow bone if you bring
color too far in or something or you
just want to clean it up
you always go in with the lighter shade
and just kind of blend it out I'm gonna
go back in with that first shade we used
and just blend this on the bottom
lashline so I'm gonna go back into the
lighter gold shade and I'm just gonna
wet it see if we can get it right with
some setting spray and see if we can get
a little more shine out of it oh yeah so
I'm just putting this only on the center
of my eye now we're talking
this one looks like 50 billion times
better wet I'm also going to take that
wet gold
and just put a tiny bit on the lower
lashline just on the inner part so for
the waterline on the bottom we're gonna
use this Tarte inner rim liner I've
never used this before this is like
super tiny like my hand is ginormous
waterproof inner rim 12-hour liner I
don't know how I feel about this I feel
like it's not coming off super black and
the tiny nough sky no makes it harder to
get like a solid line in there which is
kind of weird not a fan of that we're
going with 24/7 by Urban Decay instead
like look at how much blacker that is
I'm gonna take my finger on the white
shimmery shade in this palette and just
kind of like rub a little bit off on my
other finger and then we're just gonna
put a tiny bit of this on the inner part
because I feel like I look a little bit
raccoon like right now so now we're
gonna go in with liner I think I'm gonna
try out the essence what is called
two-in-one eye liner pen I tried this
out like one or two times and I can't
remember what I thought of it so we're
gonna try it out again I'm so attached
to my Physicians Formula
eye booster that I never want to try out
new eye liners so we're just using a
different one today well I'm using the
thin side right now by the way I believe
yeah it is nice and black see how this
wing goes not too bad actually got a
nice little point go in there alright my
camera just overheated so I just did my
other wing while it was chill now I
understand that like her one job in life
is to turn on and even knew that anyways
so I just did the other wing and it was
like one of those days where this one
just kept getting bigger so this one
just kept getting bigger you know how it
goes first impression on that eyeliner
not too bad for being like a dollar
ninety-nine or something so I'm gonna go
in with the Ardell 102 Demi's these are
like my go-to lashes when I don't want
something super dramatic but I still
want my eyelashes to look more separated
these are looking pretty dirty let's see
if we can get one more use out of these
bad boys and we're just chilling while
this dries put on some setting spray
really quick just to set our face makeup
this is gonna help a lot to make your
makeup look not it as like caked on and
make it look more fresh I'm just using
my favorite L'Oreal infallible this
stuff is like one of my Holy Grail
products I just like to fan it off and
kind of keep my eyes closed as it dries
makes your skin look super nice and
fresh and like Dewey
I am going to go over the band
afterwards
don't fret the thick side of this is
actually really great for covering the
lash band you guys can see that's kind
of like angled so it just makes it easy
it's literally like a marker so it makes
it super easy to just draw over that
thing
I'm gonna take some mascara just to
blend the natural lashes in with the
plus ones now I'm just gonna apply some
of my bottom mascara to the bottom it's
kind of like faded a little bit
throughout the day and that's everything
for the eyes alright so the camera just
overheated again so I just went ahead
and put on like a nudie one cuz I wanted
to see what it looks like
and I think we're actually gonna stick
with this I just went in with my usual
color pop cookie and color pop skimpy
that has been my go-to nude combination
lately so this is the final look if you
guys liked this video give it a thumbs
up so I know I hope this was helpful for
some of you and yeah I love you guys
thanks for watching see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
