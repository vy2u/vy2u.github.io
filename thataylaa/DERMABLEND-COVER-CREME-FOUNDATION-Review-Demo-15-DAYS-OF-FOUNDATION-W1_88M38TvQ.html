of foundation if you're new here this is
where we're trying out a new foundation
every single day for 15 days I'm not
laying days 1 through 5 down below in
the 15 days of foundation playlist so
you can go watch them if you missed any
yesterday's was a little bit of a fail
so I'm hoping today goes better feeling
a pretty crappy right now woke up in the
middle of night with food poisoning last
night so feeling a little interesting
right now but let's do this so this is
one of the foundations that you guys
requested this is the dermablend cover
creme foundation this is supposed to be
really good for acne coverage or if you
have a lot of scarring or unevenness to
cover up this basically was supposed to
be a fun coverage long lasting it does
have SPF 30 in it I have the shade pale
ivory chroma zero which is the lightest
shade alright
so hello for my future self as I was
editing this I realized I forgot two
swatches so here we are so right here is
the dermablend cover creme next one is
cap on D locket tattoo foundation in
Elle 42 right here we have Maybelline
fit me matte and poreless and lighter
shade this is Mac and W 10 and this one
is two-faced Born This Way and snow it
comes in 20 shades which is awesome and
retails for $39 and you get one fluid
ounce of product in here so reading some
of the claims on ulties website says
it's lightweight cover creme delivers a
flawless complexion 12 hours of where
it's supposed to be smudge resistant
non-comedogenic blah blah blah blends
easily to cover facial imperfections
anything that says full coverage Samiha
if you guys are excited about 15 days of
foundation don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up and leave any requests
down below with foundations that you
want to see next I feel so out of it
right now so if you guys want to see how
the dermablend cover creme applies
inwards throughout the day you're in the
right place just keep watching
okay so it is 8:30 in the morning that's
actually throwing up all night had food
poisoning but we're doing this I
basically have to like record every
single day until I leave for San Diego
so that I have all the videos ready to
go for you guys so my skin is pretty
horrible right now still have some major
breakouts going on I did just moisturize
my face with the Shiseido who I said oh
right for once
multi solution gel it's my favorite base
so when you open the box there's a
little like instruction booklet in here
it does say to use a primer for best
makeup result so I'm gonna use the
makeup from step one smoothing primer
since they say to use a primer I'm just
going to put this all over my face if
you like smoothing primers with cream
products tend to go well together
usually I'm just going to put this all
over the face I have an appointment to
get my neck work done at 10:30 and when
I go there I'm like face down in the
thing in my foundation usually it gets a
little bit messed up but this is
supposed to be smudge proof so curious
to see if that is actually true I
definitely gone and had my neck work
done and come out in my foundation look
perfect with certain foundations so it
is possible well my stomach just feels
like raw right now so on one side of my
face I'm going to use this Sigma f80 -
foundation brush this is my favorite for
cream products it's pretty densely
packed so just blend it out really
nicely
this guy this is the new morphe sponge I
haven't found a foundation that I like
this with yet but I do feel like it has
potential because this is actually
really nice squishy soft sponge to be
like just all the foundations I've
tested so far or better with brushes you
get a little spatula which is pretty
exciting okay I feel like this is when
you open a new butter and you like don't
want to touch it okay how appealing that
is let's just have a moment of silence
so it says to remove it with the spatula
placed a little bit on the back of your
hand use circular motions to warm and
soften up the product until the texture
becomes creamier and it says to apply
directly over your imperfections and
blend out a word it's definitely like it
totally hard kind of formula I'm just
scraping some off the surface here just
as you need a little bit so I'm going to
start with that and see
you know goes the consistency right now
definitely is warming up really nicely
it definitely felt pretty thick at the
beginning but the warmth of your hand
does soften it pretty nicely okay so I'm
just going to use the brush on this side
of my face shade looks pretty light and
missed some spots so I'm just gonna
apply it tiny bit more not the easiest
foundation to blend but it's also not
difficult whatever is left over on my
hand which is not a lot I'm going to
wipe on the forehead that's pretty much
it so I'll probably have to go in with a
little bit more pink on this side I'm
going to try blending out with my finger
and see how it works
well this actually looks pretty light
now that I'm looking at it I feel like
blending out with the finger gave me
better coverage than the brush took a
lot longer and probably not something
that I would do every day here's the
coverage compared to this side of my
face
obviously covered pretty well just on
one layer I don't think it has as much
coverage as the Marc Jacobs remarkable
foundation and I've given it a head
start with my finger and then we're
going to go in with the sponge that is
way faster to blend out the sponge I
feel like I'm definitely not getting as
a bit of coverage is it still shown here
this isn't totally covered the shade is
definitely a pretty pale I'm gonna have
to warm this up with a powder for sure
looking pretty ghostly right now but if
you're lighter than me then this could
be good out of all these methods so far
I kind of like my fingers the best it
takes forever like I definitely wouldn't
sit here and blend out my whole face
with my finger so far not super
impressed I don't think the texture is
sitting very well my skin looks a little
bit dry
definitely clinging to areas around my
acne dry patches right here it's not
looking that good I'm use my finger to
apply a tiny bit more just on the areas
that I need it kind of as like spot
concealing going over for a second layer
in certain spots was totally fine it
build it build it built fine I'm gonna
show you guys it close that super quick
when I use the Marc Jacobs remarkable
all this is like totally flawless and I
do feel like it still doesn't want
totally blended you can see right here
it is clean to certain dry patches on my
face and over here in this area so I'm
going to apply the rest of my makeup so
I don't look like a total ghost and I
will be right back right now it's 853
okay so it is no 911 oh don't you hate
that you look at the clock at that time
let's say 9/10 rest of my makeup is on I
feel like it looks 50 times better now
that I put a powder on and set it and in
their little instruction book thing it
does say to set it so I use the
Physicians Formula mineral wear face
powder in the shade translucent I don't
know why they call this translucent and
stuff
has a ton of color to it as you can see
it helped warm up my face really nicely
I use this powder only when I need to
darken a foundation that I put on this
one has a little bit of coverage and
does just make your face look super
flawless kind of help to blend out some
of the unevenness that was going on
I'm the evenness the word just come out
our makeup isn't super exciting today
because I'm literally just going to that
appointment and working on my lips right
now is B hue natural nude liquid
lipstick I have quickly fallen in love
with these liquid lipsticks and the
highlight I'm wearing right now is Kat
Von D's thunderstruck eyeshadow right
now it looks good I'm going to check in
right after the appointment so you guys
can see how it held up kinda feel like a
dude right now
I haven't been applying any heat to my
hair to help with the damage hence why
it's been in a button every single day
alright so it is now almost 5 o'clock so
the foundations going on for about 8
hours I don't know where this day went
I literally was just on my computer
working all day and lost track of time
sorry didn't check in sooner but uh
we're here now after the appointment my
foundation definitely wore off right
here majorly and right here I usually
get a little bit of rub but this is like
looks like it's fully off it also looks
like it's worn off down here as waist
like down head down in like a face
cradle thing so it's worn off down here
as well a little bit on this side those
boats it doesn't want that great but
everywhere else it looks totally matte
pretty much no major creasing around my
nose there's a little bit of mouth lines
right here how I feel about it right now
I'm not super impressed I feel like I've
had matte foundations they give just as
good coverage that don't look this heavy
I'm going to show you guys a close-up so
you can see what's going on in the
forehead but I'm probably going to wear
this for a couple more hours since it's
only 5 o'clock right now I literally
just ate lunch at 4:30 this day is weird
ok it turned on the light so hopefully
you guys and see that it's totally worn
off right here and right here even in
the center of my face or didn't really
touch it does look like textured a
little bit cakey you can see down here
it also wore off nothing major around
the nose mouth area really all right so
it's now 704 p.m.
probably show you guys so foundations
been on for almost ten hours and I just
posted day one my time of 15 days of
foundation and I just wanna say thank
you guys so much for all the comments
and feedback I'm glad you guys like the
intro I hope it doesn't get repetitive
15 times but yeah I've just been in a
weird like YouTube community funk lately
which I talked about in the rant video
but this just makes all bit worth it
social and say thank you guys Avery
don't say I'm coming through love you
guys
so first off I want to say I feel like I
was really boring in this video I feel
like I was like half asleep we're not
feeling well through 80% of it but
that's kind of what comes with having to
film every single day I feel like not
everyday I'm like on and in filming mode
and feeling great I've pre-recorded as
much as I can I basically have to film
every single day to be on schedule when
I'm putting these up sorry this one
wasn't the most entertaining probably
but feeling reenergized and my like work
out right now I just feel like really
hyped on life after reading all of your
comments I feel like I'm majorly
breaking out like even worse I have
another huge one coming right here you
know those foundations and you can just
feel your skin not liking it it doesn't
look good I was trying to think of a
foundation this reminds me of and just
the way that it's sitting on my skin it
kinda reminds me of the Kat Von D
lock-it touchy foundation which a lot of
you guys asked me for full review on and
that's not going to be a part of 15 days
but I might do that eventually just
because l42 is a super pale shade I am
NOT a fan of the formula I'll just ruin
the surprise and tell you right now it
looks beautiful on some people on me it
looks like a cakey mess it looks so
heavy and so cakey and that's kind of
what this is remind me of just doesn't
look like skin it looks like I'm wearing
a ton of makeup I will say that it
stayed pretty matte for being on for
about 10 hours the areas that I usually
get super shiny I'm not that shiny right
now definitely don't think this is for
dry skin even just thinking about how
the supply and stuff I just feel like
it's way too much effort for the results
that I got I definitely wouldn't wear
this on an everyday basis having to
apply it like that and like blend it out
with my fingers so unfortunately this
one was kind of a bust - did we just
film
yesterday I think we did I can you
remember they're all I've learned
together now but I hope we don't have to
shitty ones in a row this one definitely
was not as bad as SOPA glory I just
don't think this worked for me as I was
hoping it would probably going to be
returning this I don't think it's worth
the $39 to me tomorrow's video is one
that has a ton of hype so I hope it's
good I hope we have a positive one in
here soon I'm going to link all the days
down below if you missed them but if you
guys like this video and you're excited
about 15 days of foundation give it a
thumbs up love you guys thanks for
watching see you my next video see you
tomorrow still not getting used to that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
