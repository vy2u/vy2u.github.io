I'm pretty sure there was no caffeine in
my first one all right so today it is
day 7 of 15 days of foundation whoa we
are almost halfway there so if you're
new here 15 days of foundation is a new
first impression video every single day
for 15 days links for the eBay sale and
the t-shirts are down below in the
description box 100% of the proceeds go
to project beauty share also wanted to
say since I haven't announced it in a
video yet is in my time they just went
live yesterday but I made heck yeah
versions of the t-shirts so for those of
you who don't want a shirt that says
hell yes you can go with the PG version
let's jump into the foundation so this
one has been requested for a while so
the dermablend smooth liquid camo medium
coverage foundation
I tried have a different dermablend
foundation and I think it was the first
series of 15 days of foundation and I
was not feeling that one but new day new
foundation so back in October Mallory
and I went to beauty Colin Mallory 17/12
one of the brands there was dermablend
and I got shade matched there we will
get to the shade in a second but I've
had this thing sitting in my drawer
since then so reading some of the claims
on Sephora this product retails for $37
and you get one fluid ounce of product
in here which is standard well they're
just got like way dry this only comes in
10 shades not great so I have the shade
cream which says for fair skin with
neutral undertones the only other shade
that says for fair skin is linen with
cool undertones so I'm not sure if that
one would match me better so it says
it's a liquid foundation that provides
medium coverage for minor to moderate
skin concerns providing seamless
coverage in an ultra smooth finish this
description is actually kind of
contradicting because if you keep
reading it says it delivers twice the
coverage of a classic foundation
camouflaging redness uneven skintone
blemishes hyperpigmentation and freckles
so to me double the coverage of a normal
foundation sounds like it should be very
high coverage on the packaging and
online it says medium coverage up to 16
hours of transfer-resistant we're never
cakey or masky boom Matthews now word it
provides all-day hydration and SPF 25 so
that's all the claims on here since this
does have SPF 25 I'm going to be doing
flash tests so I'm going to search
swatches right here so you can see how
the shade cream compares to some of the
other lighter Shemp what word was they
even going for their lightest foundation
shades that I own all right so swatch
time right here is the dermablend smooth
liquid camo foundation in cream next
over is Urban Decay Naked Skin
Foundation in 0.5 derma call to 0-8 pur
cosmetics paradol foundation laura
geller cover lock foundation in
porcelain which I reviewed and day 2 I
think it was and then Estee Lauder
Double Wear in 1c0 so if you're excited
for 15 days of foundation don't forget
to give this video a thumbs up if you
want to see my socks on the dermablend
smooth liquid camo foundation and how to
apply somewhere throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching
so it's 9:30 in the morning right now so
far do you wash moisturize and primed my
face we're gonna use the Real Techniques
sponge on one side of my face in the
morphe e31
foundation brush on the other just to
see if there's a difference in
application the packaging is just kind
of a standard squeeze tube packaging I
like that it has kind of a matte finish
though I didn't film yesterday in my
time because I was feeling pretty crappy
and I'm still not feeling super great on
top of my normal stuff I think I'm
actually getting sick right now
hopefully not I'm just going to drink a
 ton of vitamin C just put out about
a dime-size mal or less than that and
let's go in and stipple is looking a
little dark color is definitely off whoo
is a dewy finish right now and it's
looking really smooth and that just
would not super-quick shade is
definitely too dark a bit orange e
almost so you do not need a lot of
products for this I'm just going to
spread this out so I just got way too
much more forehead it's almost like
melting into my skin can't see any kind
of texture at all so we got pretty good
coverage I would say low full coverage
there's still some stuff coming through
down here but I think we can cover that
just on a thin second layer just on
those spots it's setting but it has that
kind of gel field
it looks really good on my skin right
now okay let's go into a sponge on the
other side so I'm getting a little bit
lighter coverage on the sponge side so
sponge it looks like about medium
coverage I can't get over how this is
sitting on my skin it looks super smooth
if you don't like gooey foundations you
would not like this because this
definitely has a do and it glow to it
but I think this looks really nice it
looks great on the center of my forehead
on my forehead just in general it's kind
of hiding all of my dryness up there
I've Foundation skin so I get oily
throughout the day but I do have some
dry patches and stuff on my forehead so
I want to see if this is buildable just
on the spots where I need it I'm going
to leave my forehead like that but I'm
just going to add a tiny bit down in
this area where I have more acne and I
do like the brush better to apply this
so I am getting more coverage it covered
all that now it looks like total full
coverage but it looks a little bit heavy
on the second layer actually yeah you
can kind of see the foundation on right
there so I don't know if I would
recommend building this up and try it
with the sponge on this side you think
it's a little bit less heavy looking for
the second layer a sponge is definitely
the way to go I'm just going to go over
that area with the sponge since I'm
wearing a turtleneck I'm just going to
pull us all the way down this area down
here and my chin looks much more matte
for some reason the only thing I'm not
liking right now is where I built it up
with the brush down here but everywhere
else looks great right now so time right
now is 937 I don't know if I'm going to
powder with this I really like the kind
of glowy look I have going on right now
but I'm afraid I'm going to get oily if
I don't I don't know we'll figure it out
so I'm going to go do the rest of my
makeup and I will be right back alright
so it's now 10:00 whoa 10:42 we're going
to call the check-in time ten o'clock
since that's when I finish up with my
face makeup and it got majorly
sidetracked ended up only setting the
very center of my face right here with a
cosmetic celebration foundation
illumination my under-eye concealer was
so light today that I actually had to
use this to set my under eyes that's how
dark this is on my skin if that gives
you any kind of perspective this is what
I usually use to set my entire face
overall I think it looks beautiful right
now
it just looks extremely smooth and plump
and healthy which I like if it doesn't
make me greaseball by the end of the
night here's the close-up what it looks
like damn like looking in the viewfinder
I think it looks amazing since this has
SPF 25 let's go ahead and do a flash
test so it looks like there's a little
bit of bounce back but nothing horrible
doesn't look like total gross face and I
think it looks pretty good on camera so
on the rest of my face to contour I use
the morphe 9c palette this shade right
here is one of my favorites all right
there blush is two-faced Papa don't
peach blush elf illuminating palette as
a highlight this light highlight shade
right here is totally underrated it is
gorgeous look at that eye shadow Urban
Decay ultimate basics I'm addicted to
this thing mascaras my normal mascara
will be down below and then pur
cosmetics addicted is a liquid lipstick
that's on my lips I think I use this in
a foundation Friday or something and I
said that it felt like the NYX soft
matte lip cream and I didn't like that
because it didn't feel like it dried
down and these do dry down it just takes
literally 5 to 10 minutes for it to
fully set I think that's everything
oh I tried out this new makeup forever
browsing this is interesting
it's a brow liner I did my normal brow
routine the precisely my brow pencil
with gimme brow but then just on the
center to get the like flicked up look I
use this brow liner by Makeup Forever
I literally just drew on the strokes so
oh so check-in time is 10 o'clock I will
see you guys in a few hours in natural
lighting alright so right now it is 3:10
so if foundations belong for 5 hours
I feel pretty shitty right now I'm
starting to feel a migraine coming on so
I'm going to make this super brief I'm
like nauseous right now so I pretty much
love the way everything looks except my
upper lip I'm just getting some minor
creasing it's not horrible right now but
it is there my forehead just looks
amazing I feel like my face just looks
very smoothed out and almost like
blurred a little bit I'm not getting
oily yet but I definitely still look
very dewy I think it just looks kind of
healthy right now though okay it's about
one shade too dark I think if I mix in a
little bit of a lighter foundation this
can definitely work it looks a bit
yellow to me too if you look at like my
shoulder in my hand but I'm going to go
late
and hopefully I will see you guys at the
end all right so it's now at 8:30 and
I've been in bed all night and I'm going
to make this super brief because I just
want to wrap this up but at the line run
hot pack on the side of my face it's
actually held up really well feel like
overall I definitely look a bit oily but
for ten hours it's not like horrific Lee
oily specifically we're dining now right
now but for not setting my entire
physically setting right here I think
actually looks really good at the thing
I like is I even though it's a bit oily
it's not breaking down anywhere around
my nose and right there even though it's
definitely oily he's not separating
which is promising so I think if I set
this with the powder in certain areas
next time and probably hold up pretty
well so I'll try that for the wrap-up
video and up to you guys but sorry this
is a brief I can top of the video having
a bad health day so I hope you guys like
this video if you did make sure you give
it a thumbs up love you guys thanks for
watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
