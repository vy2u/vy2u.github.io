and then Gothic Easter over here
happened all right so today it is day 13
of 15 days of foundation this is where I
try out a new foundation every single
day for 15 days
so during season 2 a 15 days of
foundation the last one I tried out
derma call makeup cover which is the
most full coverage foundation I've ever
tried seen used in my life
but where it still looks like skin it's
one of my favorite foundations when I
just want something for a few hours to
look amazing
and the last few months derma Col has
kind of blown up online i'm going to
leave my review over here if you missed
it that one is not super long-lasting on
my skin but i love it when I just want
my skin to look for gain flawless so I
wanted to try out something else from
derma Col this is the acne cover makeup
and corrector I love trying out a
foundation that I haven't seen anything
about or heard anything about so this is
actually foundation and concealer in one
there's a little nub down here I got
this on eBay for about eight bucks you
can find it online anywhere from like
7/10 you get 30 milliliters or 1.01
ounces of products the thing that drew
me to this is obviously I have acne I
like to cover it it doesn't matter fie
skin it's as it prevents acne and it has
tea tree oil in it which is supposed to
be good for acne so sign me up on their
website it says that this is a
two-in-one makeup and corrector for
problematic acne prone skin is supposed
to have medium coverage which is kind of
interesting because I feel like if it's
geared towards acne you probably want to
make it a little more full coverage it
says this light foundation with
perfecting corrector makes your
complexion uniform and gently covers
pimples and red skin this light
foundation cares for the skin all day
long provides it with a matte appearance
and does not clog pores tea tree oil
with antibacterial and antiseptic
effects support skin regeneration
supposed to
juice sebum formation or make you less
oily so this only comes in four shades
which is obviously pretty shitty as the
lightest shade which is the shade one so
I'm going to serve swatches right here
of this shade compared to the normal
dermal called foundation in the lightest
shade which is 208 that foundation is
perfect shade match for me I think
that's my closest shade match I've ever
found and also next to some other
foundations just so you can see how it
compares alright so swatch time right
here is the derma call acne cover
foundation in the shade one next to it
is the derma call makeup cover the full
coverage foundation in 2:08
as you can see huge shade difference
here Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless 110 Urban Decay Naked Skin
Foundation in 0.5 these are the Max
Factor pan stick foundations in that
review I told you guys that I bought two
shades fair and one swatch it next to
the shade true beige so here's the shade
25 fair here's the shade 12 true beige
this one is probably one of the more
salmon kind of pink tone foundations
I've ever seen this is super super pink
so update you guys in the wrap-up I wear
those but here they are so I think
that's all the claims on here derma call
is cruelty free since there's only two
days left is 15 days of foundation don't
forget to get your t-shirts and hoodies
down below in the description box 100%
of the proceeds go to project me to
share so if you want to see what I think
of the derma call acne cover and how it
applies somewhere throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching
you know it's day 13 when we're dry
shampoo the past five days sorry now
it's 8 o 8 in the morning I've already
washed moisturize and priming my face
using the Laura Mercier foundation
primer so it twists off what the whole
thing is coming off by the look of this
concealer on the end it looks pretty
dark foundation supposed to be medium
coverage so I think I'm first going to
spot concealer with their concealer on
the end of here and I just pushed it
back in since it did come out apply this
to the face and blend this out with my
finger feels pretty stiff definitely too
dark you can see like 4-inch concealer
down on my next okay that doesn't seem
to cover at all like at all and now
we're gonna not use that I don't even
know if that qualifies as a concealer
I'm going to squeeze some product out
onto my palette it's kind of like a
mousse a fake formula oh it smells good
it smells like
Petrey so here's my Sigma f80 brush on
one side of my face and the Real
Techniques makeup sponge on the other if
you don't like the teacher resent you
would not like this because you can
definitely smell the teacher in there I
personally like it I love the bodyshop
tea tree line the shade is too dark
about a shade too dark maybe two shades
but I'm thinking if this actually helps
modify throughout the day which is
supposed to this might be good to mix in
with derma call the makeup cover I'm
also not getting a whole lot of coverage
with this so if I wanted to amp up the
coverage so with the brush on one layer
I don't think this is quite medium
coverage it looks like I'm just a light
tinted moisturizer it has a really
pretty glowy look to it wonder if it's
going to modify as it sets a little bit
if your skin will have a natural and
matte appearance so right now it's not
looking mad at all I'm not liking how
this is applying with a sponge getting
kind of patchy and it looks a little bit
dry almost with the sponge the brush is
better with this one I'm going to switch
the brush to finish that off coverage
looked about the same with a sponge but
for getting a smooth even application a
brush is definitely the way to go the
consistency of this is kind of like a
gel and it does feel a little bit
cooling on the face probably from the
tea tree right now I have light coverage
going I wouldn't call this medium
coverage off of one layer it's sitting
nice on my skin it just looks kind of
glowy and very natural so I'm going to
try and build this up to see if we can
get a little bit more coverage see if I
can get it to medium coverage I like how
it's looking on my forehead it looks
really plump it's not settling in
anywhere on my dry patches or anything
I'm going to kind of just smooth it out
with a sponge a little bit yeah
something weird happens when you use a
sponge it gets really almost dry looking
so just kidding no sponge it almost
separates with a sponge oh you know what
maybe because there's tea tree oil in
here I wonder if the water and the
sponge kind of separates the oil that's
probably what's happening doesn't quite
look like the shade is showing up on
camera but it is definitely a couple
shades dark I hope this doesn't oxidize
I would call this low medium coverage on
two layers very low it's almost light
coverage but it does look very natural
and glowy
and I think if you like more light
coverage this looks really pretty right
now
it almost feels like when a sunscreen is
drying right now it's 823 if I'm into
the rest of my makeup and I'll be right
back okay so it's now 905 we're going to
call the check-in time 8:30 because
that's about when I finished up my face
makeup I wasn't planning on setting my
face with the powder because I kind of
wanted to see just how the foundation
controlled my oil throughout the day but
I was actually setting my under eyes
with the powder I usually use all over
my face because this foundation was so
dark and it looked flawless under there
and kind of where my concealer method
foundation so I decided to put this all
over my face this is the Laura Geller
double take baked powder foundation this
is one the powders I always used to set
my face and now I am loving it with this
powder on top it definitely added
coverage I mean it looks pretty much
full coverage now this powder usually
has a very matte finish but the thing I
like is that the radiance from the
foundation is still coming through you
can see on my forehead it looks pretty
dewy still and it looks like skin and I
don't feel like I have two layers of
foundation and a powder on right now it
almost just feels like I have a BB cream
on and this also helped to lighten my
face so now it's definitely more
wearable this shade as far as the claims
I don't know if I agree with them this
definitely isn't medium coverage off of
one layer and it's also not a matte
finish at all it actually say this is a
pretty dewy finish without the powder
and even with the mattifying powder on
top of it and then this concealer they
just need to get rid of this so on the
rest of my face to contour use the
Physicians Formula bronze booster this
middle shade for blushes wet-and-wild
might I buy you a drink
I just got that highlight is the makeup
forever profusion zero one highlight
pretty but I feel like it kind of
emphasizes my texture a bit it's like
this pinky
kind of shade for all the matte shadows
on my eyes and the black and everything
I use the Urban Decay Naked ultimate
basics palette and then for this
extremely obnoxiously pink shade I use
the pur cosmetics trolls palette and
this was very pigmented really nice I
also use these two shades out of here
actually I guess I only used a black and
matte palette lashes are pure bombshell
and then lifts I use Smashbox foiled
Bratz eyes already burnin so these
lashes will definitely be off in the
next check-in like I said we're calling
the check-in time 8:30 and extra can I
do will be in natural lighting so I'll
see you guys in okay so it's 223 so
foundations been on for almost six hours
I obviously
look a bit different right now so I
don't know what it was but my eyes were
50 times more scratchy and burning they
still are than they usually are I don't
think it was the lash glue I think it
was either a mascara I used underneath
the lashes or for one of the shadows I
have no idea that I almost had to wipe
off my whole face of makeup because my
eyes are just so intense right now it's
like I just need to take a shower but I
just put eyedrops in so it's all good
but anyways just looking at the
foundation I think it looks pretty good
there's some heaviness around my nose
and upper lips but that could just be
the powder even with that powder to
lighten it it does still look a bit dark
on my skin and I am really dewy I
wouldn't call this matte at all I don't
think I'm quite at the point where I
would say I'm oily yet maybe a little
bit actually around my nose area I'm
going to zoom you guys in right now I
don't think it looks amazing I'm not
like incredibly bad or anything but I
also don't hate it so I'm going to keep
wearing this one throughout the day I'm
about to have leftover Chipotle so it's
a good day I've already edited two
videos filled this one obviously I got
the triple shot of expressive this
morning I think that is the key to life
folks I'm going to hopefully wear this
throughout the day if my eyes are still
okay and I'll check back in with you
guys at the end of the night write this
now exactly eight o'clock so the
Foundation's on for 11 and a half hours
I look like a hot mess right now I feel
like a hot mess right now
I literally just stood here for 30
seconds trying to think about what
foundation is on my face right now
it's definitely oxidized I feel like
even more and I don't know why doesn't
show up that's a little better but still
not showing up quite as orange as in
real life my forehead doesn't look great
I wouldn't say this is oil controlling
at all or mattifying and pretty oily
right now and it is separating on my
forehead as well into a separation right
there around my nose area oily I think
for me I'm going to have to mix this in
with another product and that's really
when I'll be able to tell if I like it
or not so alone just for me this one's I
know there's a couple foundations that I
am really hoping gets here before the
end of the series so I did the model
zone matte foundations and also the
flower BB creams so fingers crossed that
those get here if not those will be
coming in Sunday
Friday videos so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video if you did make sure to give
it a thumbs up love you guys thanks for
watching see you tomorrow
