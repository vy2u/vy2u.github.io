talking about skin how to make it glow
I've been all about the dewy skin lately
the foundation stuff that I'm going to
show you guys in today's video I'm using
pretty much every day this month and I
freaking love this combination blog the
stuff that I got that I'm using this
video is from glambot which you guys
know that I'm freaking obsessed with it
just have the best deals if you haven't
read glambot you can get pre loved
makeup on there it's basically like an
online blog sale but a store and it's
amazing they do these like crazy 80% off
60% off markdown things make sure you're
signed up for their email that's where I
find out about them and as soon as I get
an email I hop on there and I start
shopping because things sell out
freaking fast I don't like spending full
price on high-end makeup so the glam box
basically where I go to try everything
out and it's great this video is gonna
be all focused on the skin I did just
film my how I got rid of acne video I
think that'll be up before this so hell
yeah finally got it up if you guys want
to see how I achieve healthy looking
dewy skin you're in the right place just
keep watching this just headband you up
I think I got this from Dollar Tree like
years ago so for this video I love
talking about skin and foundation so
I've already primed my face I mixed the
Too Faced hangover RX which I got off
plane bought with the Maybelline master
prime blur and illuminates is really
nice illuminating primer if you're
already planning on wearing a dewy
foundation this can be a little much
with that this I've been using for about
a week or two now and it hasn't broken
me out which is a bonus it's silicone
free which is what attracted me to this
I haven't been using any silicone
primers and I've been using my body shot
primer I'm surprised that more people
don't mention this but this smells like
a straight up coconut not even like
coconut lotion like you're rubbing a
coconut all over your face if you don't
like to smell coconut you won't like
this I kind of find it weirdly
refreshing has coconut water
electrolytes and probiotics in it I
think I got this for like 10 bucks or
something on glambot it is like halfway
empty but it's good if you just want to
try something else and ation I'm going
to be using today's what I've been
wearing for the last pretty much all of
August NARS sheer glow mixed with hard
candy glamoflauge and it's like a bubble
in my throat since I got this off of
glam bar I don't have it
lighter shade because they didn't have
it at the moment when I was shopping in
the shade light to Mont Blanc it isn't
the lightest shade I just ordered this
in Siberia because I freaking love this
foundation I don't know how I've waited
this long to try this I think it's
because it says shear in it and anything
that says shear turns me off oh I
just poured away too much oh I'm using
my laptop desk right now as like a
little makeup thing and fab working I
literally just got enough foundation for
all of America I think we rescued enough
I'm just going to put about a pump of
the hard candy and I'm just going to mix
with my finger I love the finish of this
combination it lasts all day I did not
think shear load was going to last just
because NARS Foundation's usually get
really oily on me has such a beautiful
finish it feels super lightweight when
you're putting it on but it actually has
good coverage I should have grabbed the
mirror properly I don't usually apply my
eye makeup first but I did just fill my
acne video today that's why that's
happening so I'm just gonna go in with
my Beauty Blender because my Real
Techniques sponge it is dirty never
applied lipstick before foundation
either I like don't understand how
people apply their makeup before their
foundation like I feel like I'm just
gonna rub off my eye makeup what do you
guys do do you do your eyeshadow first
to your foundation first all right so
just with one layer you can see how much
coverage we got this foundation lays so
nice on your skin I'm just turning the
Beauty Blender to get in the little
crevices of my eyeballs as you do about
one and a half layers of this and like
go over spots like this where I just
need a little more coverage my acne
scarring if you're going for a dewy
finish using a makeup sponge is really
great since you do have little water in
there it just helps to do up the skin a
little bit so this is what it looks like
you can see the light reflecting off my
skin which I love like it makes it look
like skin and just more natural I got
way too much foundation on here we have
like a whole other face concealer I've
been using is my Holy Grail Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer this stuff is
amazing
if you haven't bought it yet go buy it
it's worth it it is amazing I've been
using my Beauty Blender lately to
conceal I do think that it's so except
well just miss the bottle like three
times I do think that it soaks up some
of the product concealer in the hair
we're going to get that later I do think
it soaks up some of the products but
when I don't want to get my fingers like
covered in concealer I use it how do you
people do this like we're gonna have to
retouch the whole eye so since we're
going for a super dewy look before I set
my under eye I'm going to use this NYX
born to eliminate no.4 to glow liquid
illuminator you want to make sure you do
all of your liquids before you start
going in with powders because that is
not a pleasant combination so I'm just
dabbing this on with my finger a little
bit on the top of my cheekbone that's
where the light hits naturally and then
I'm going to go in with the Beauty
Blender and just pounce pounce it out
ladies I'm also going to run a tiny bit
of this down the bridge of my nose and
Cupid's bow without getting a little
lipstick I'm going to use a much smaller
brush than I usually do to powder my
under eye just because I don't want it
to be getting on that illuminator and
I'm just going to sweep this under the
eyes this is my Physicians Formula Holy
Grail just gonna set the under-eye
concealer when I usually wear this
foundation combo I don't set it with a
powder but I found the cover FX
emanating powder off of glambot and this
is like completely full this is in the
shade light it looks like it'll be light
enough it's basically a illuminating
loose setting powder it got good reviews
on Sephora I think just swirling my
brush in the cap this is the ax-cut
metics powder brush and it is
life-changing we're just gonna set the
face I'm going to use whatever is left
over on the brush and just do the sides
on my forehead I want to keep the middle
of superduty looking it doesn't look
super matte so that's good highlight I
have been loving this
later lately this is the pure minerals
afterglow powder
I literally have concealer everywhere
right now pretty much every day for the
last few weeks I've been wearing this
highlight it is beautiful it looks so
much prettier on your face and it does
in the pan to highlight I usually use
one of two brushes the Sedona lace FBO
one brush and this is a huge-ass fan
brush usually gives more of like a
diffused kind of thing so if I want a
super intense highlight actually going
with a foundation brush and I usually
just Pat it on top of my cheekbones and
then will go in and like blend it out
with this foundation brush that you get
in the vortex set patting product on
here tapping it off we're going to lay
this on top of that illuminator and look
at that ladies and gentlemen look at
that I'm also going to bring this down
the bridge of my nose and Cupid's bow
we're going with a bronzer which I
didn't bring think we're gonna go in
with Mac mineralize skinfinish in medium
deep this is what I use when I want a
super warm bronzer this is like very
warm it also has a really nice natural
finish to it I'm not going to bring this
up to my temples today just because I
want the whole pale thing going on for
blush pretty much every day I've been
using the becca blush from glambot and
this is gypsy super nice purpley pink
shimmery shade when you use blush with a
stippling brush make sure you top it off
I like this color because it's pink but
it's not like super overpowering and if
you have back to the foundation if you
have pale skin I would just say get in
our shared glow in the lightest shade
because you don't really need to mix it
with glamoflage that's just what I have
on the way that just came on my head
with a light so before we set the makeup
I'm gonna go in and touch up my eye
shadow for a sec
my eyes are mostly the Sephora Pantone
palette today I'm just going to blend
out bottom lashline again if you're
going to be setting your makeup make
sure that your mascara is completely dry
before you do so I usually set my makeup
before I do any of my eye makeup so for
setting sprays you can totally use just
a normal setting spray my favorite is
the
l'oreal infallible pro setting spray
this is like completely empty right now
but if you're looking for a dewy setting
spray I have a few different options
here that we're going to talk about the
first is the tatcha luminous dewy skin
mist
Jacqueline Hillman we do it I've used
this a few times now and this is just
the travel sized version I'll link it
down below but if you don't want to
spend like 40 bucks or whatever this is
on a full-size try out the travel size
it's like 15 I've used this a few times
and so far I'm not super super impressed
I don't know if I'm just not using
enough of it but I actually think this
does a lot better of a job this is the
Lancome in love setting spray the only
thing with this is it sprays out like a
freaking fire hose and it's super
scented you need to like plug your nose
when you spray this because it literally
feels like you're spraying perfume like
directly on your face not good smelling
perfume it does make your skin super
freaking dewy though I actually really
like the results of this stuff and then
I have the NYX dewy finish long-lasting
setting spray I've never actually tried
this so I think we're going to try it
today this is a good comment this is a
good drugstore option we're just going
to try this out okay the sprayer was
nice misting the smell isn't super
strong which is nice I'm just gonna fan
it off this is actually looking really
nice I feel like that did more than
tatra that's just me
I don't think I'm spraying enough chacha
I'm actually just going to take my pure
minerals illuminator again just put a
little bit on my finger and we're just
going to plop this on the inner corner
alright here's what the skin is looking
like let me know what your guys's
favorite products are for dewy skin if
you guys liked this video and it was
helpful for you give it a thumbs up so I
know love you guys thanks for watching
see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
