days of foundation this is where I test
out a new foundation every single day
for 15 days it is cloudy and rainy today
in Seattle and cold and I am so freaking
excited I'm gonna go put on a sweater so
excited so today we're gonna be talking
about a foundation that I have heard so
freaking much about over the years
mostly amazing things this is the dior
air flash spray foundation I tested out
the Sephora spray foundation and I think
it was season two I'll link that video
down below and in the little eye over
here but in this review I mentioned I
don't know if I'll ever be able to bring
myself to purchase a $60 dior foundation
the day has come I did it testing it out
for you guys this foundation I feel like
is one of the most loved kind of hyped
up foundations on YouTube this is a
spray foundation in the can
sounds like spray paint retails for $62
but you get 2.3 fluid ounces of product
I hope everything's okay there's been
like a siren every two minutes literally
I'm assuming they give you more product
than a standard fluid ounce and spray
foundations he's kind of to use more I
don't know how long that would last
compared to like the liquid foundation I
have the lightest shade in this which is
a hundred ivory on Sephora it says very
light neutral undertone I would not call
a shade very light I'm gonna serve
swatches right here so you can see how
the shade compares to the Sephora
airbrush foundation and also a few other
foundations that I own so since it's a
little bit tricky to swatch Spray
foundations and I'm just gonna spray
both the Dior and the Sephora on my arm
so you guys can see the shades alright
so there's the DR air flash in 100 I'm
gonna do the lightest shade of this
forest brave Foundation which is cream
okay that was a bizarre swatch so as you
see lightest shade it's for one is quite
a bit lighter than the Dior rating on
Sephora it says it's an ultra light
foundation that delivers an airbrushed
effect with precision and ease get a
runway run run run way runway ready look
with this innovative Miss Foundation
inspired by the airbrushing techniques
use backstage at fashion shows customize
your coverage by choosing to apply it
straight from the can for a lighter
finish or with a kabuki brush for fuller
coverage diminish the appearance of skin
irregular
and fine lines leaving our skin glowing
with optimal radiance so I solve the
claims obviously for 62 bucks again it's
gonna have to kind of blow my mind if
you've been enjoying 15 days of
foundation don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up if you're new here you
can join the BAE Rito family and
subscribe so if you want to see what I
think of the Dior skin air flash
foundation and how it applied somewheres
throughout the day and if it's worth it
62 bucks you're in the right place just
keep watching very exciting news the
chin reflector is back totally forgot
about this with the move but a lot of
the times when in my mirror it looks
like my foundation matches and you guys
think it's too light it's because
there's a major shadow being cast right
here from the lights
so this basically bounces the back do
you see the difference so chin reflector
general actor so right now it's 846 in
the morning like I said I reviewed the
Sephora airbrush foundation and that
video I tried spring it all over my face
tried it with the brush sponge and I
despised spring foundation on my face it
basically gets everywhere it gets on
your clothes gets on your hair it's not
something that I would do on a daily
basis or even for like special events
because it just gets everywhere I also
have lash extensions on right now so I
feel like spraying all over my face
would be not a great idea so I'm gonna
try just bring like a smaller area on my
cheek and blending it out with a brush
it says for fuller coverage use a brush
and that's what I'm going for taking it
out of the box here's what it looks like
let's shake this I feel like I'm about
to do some crafting oh that's just like
thickened up really quick okay I'm
scared if you are gonna try spring this
all over your face I would definitely
put on like a headband a towel around
your face around your face don't do that
I tell or something around your body
because you're gonna be covered in
foundation if you don't actually I
should probably do that even though I'm
just spraying like a small section on my
face I'm not gonna spray it from super
far away I'm just gonna spray it and
then like blend out with a book whereas
my boys going and then blend it out with
a brush Oh mmm just got that in my mouth
pretty sure
okay I'm gonna blend that out whoa
that's a lot of product whew off the bat
this has much better coverage than the
Sephora airbrush foundation whoa that
looks really nice and smooth shade is
definitely dark hopefully this doesn't
oxidize you like start oxidizing
actually did not just get way darker for
down here on my neck I'm gonna spray it
just directly on the brush by the way
I'm using my ELF 'el to my blending
brush don't say that I'm gonna spray it
right on the brush I'm probably just
gonna have to blend this really far down
my neck so it's not covering acne super
well like down here you can definitely
still see my acne with one layer but it
might build I'm gonna spray some on the
back of the palate and then dip my brush
into it it does kind of like fly up I'm
gonna dip my brush in it seems to go
pretty far ya know I do feel like it
gives you the best coverage and goes on
the bus if you spray it on and then
blend it out outside I'm not getting
wait it's good of coverage and doesn't
look quite as smooth as this side block
the eyelashes yeah for whatever reason
you get way better coverage just spring
it on your face it just looks better
that way I have a damp sponge here I
want to just try and smooth out my nose
add a little bit on the sponge the
finish looks really pretty very
smoothing and it does kind of look
almost airbrush I think for the forehead
I want to try spraying it on and then
blending it out with the sponge
my eyebrows are bad right now they're at
that point where they're like too short
to pluck and wax you know I'm saying
really don't like spring this on but got
to do what you gotta do let's attempt to
not get this all over my hairline
looks really good on the center of my
forehead yeah it looks pretty I could
see how if you didn't have acne or like
a lot to cover up how this would look
full coverage cuz on the areas of my
face where I don't it looks really
beautiful and it looks pretty full
coverage where I have all my stuff going
on it's not totally covering it I'm
gonna try and spray some down here and
see if we can build it up to cover my
acne but on areas like my forehead it
looks like really great coverage I'm
gonna do the sponge again I think it
goes really far like you can see the
product kind of spreading there it is
building still doesn't look like full
coverage so I think if you have acne
this is one that I would probably go in
with one layer and then just spot
conceal I don't typically like doing
that in foundation videos because then
you see concealer not the foundation but
for it today for testing it out I'm just
gonna leave it like that but if I was
wearing this I would put it on one layer
like this side and then just going in
spot conceal on those spots if I'm
remembering correctly this doesn't seem
to dry quite as fast as this for one
which I like cuz you have a little bit
more time to work with it before it
totally like sets down thank you good
about the same coverage with brush and
sponge on this one it's looking
beautiful the foundation is now like
down my neck to here finish looks like a
really pretty satin finish I am loving
the way my forehead looks my forehead
looks super smooth very like airbrush so
does the rest of my face it is getting a
little bit cakey or on my nose area like
my upper lip and nose already are
starting a crease and look a little bit
heavy but my chin looks good
cheeks look good it also feels pretty
lightweight like it's not one of those
foundations that you can feel like when
you talk and stuff it just feels like
air I don't think I'm gonna powder my
face with this one but we will see so
I'm gonna do the rest of makeup and I'll
be right back alright so now 9:40 we're
calling the check-in time nine o'clock
since that's when I left you guys last
and finish up my face I did not end up
setting my face I didn't really feel
like I needed to and I felt like it
might take away from the finish powder
products blend it out on top fine but I
do feel like when I was putting on my
contour it kind of took away some of the
coverage and like rubbed it off a little
bit I would not recommend wearing
earrings when spraying this on your face
I had to do like a deep clean of my
earrings
get the foundation out but everything
right now is looking great it does look
really dewy but I think it's just kind
of like a healthy glow which I like took
a little clip and natural lighting so
I'll put that in right here I think
everything looks good I'm a little bit
concerned about creasing just because
it's already starting around my nose a
little bit and also when I was doing my
makeup my forehead right here in my line
started creasing so I just kind of
smoothed it out with the sponge I'm
curious to see if this crease is more
throughout the day so on the rest of my
face it's been a few days since I filmed
day 9 and since then I've been using the
Smashbox contour palette which I've
mentioned in another video I don't know
if is one of these but this shade is so
freakin pretty I've been like addicted
to this as a contour shade then for
blush I used a makeup forever blush I
use this one right here the number will
be down below for my face highlight
which got a little intense today but I'm
kind of feeling it and for my eyeshadow
I use the BH Cosmetics Carli bybel
palette I talked about this five billion
times but I love this palette it's
beautiful I went in with this shade for
the highlight and then just some of the
purple kind of matte shades for my
eyeshadows lips I'm also obsessed with
this color this is the L'Oreal
infallible paint matte in the shade
tongue-tied I use this a couple days ago
in a video but then I topped it with the
la girl lip if I one swipe intense
creamy color this is in the shade
dreamer and just added like a little bit
of a glossy finish to this these are
really nice they're super pigmented and
that is it you can't even appreciate my
taco shirt right now there you go so
check-in time is 9 o'clock I have to go
clean my entire car because I spilled
sprite everywhere all over it yesterday
also a bird or some kind of animal did
the most massive on the side of my
car things you want to know but that's
what's happening this morning so I'll
see you guys in a few hours in natural
lighting ok so it's now 2 o'clock that's
been on for 5 hours and I just took a
look in the mirror it looks really nice
it looks like very almost natural and
soft it looks really nice and smooth
still on the skin doesn't look like it's
really breaking down anywhere it looks
pretty much like it did I feel like when
I first applied it I might be getting a
little bit oily on the center of my
forehead
it's definitely oxidized a couple shades
I feel like from when I first put it on
so it is way dark it looks normal
you find her I don't know how to show
you guys how it are she looks there
that's a little better right now I think
it looks like a nice medium coverage
foundation I'll see you guys at the end
of the night for the last check-in I
just got so freaking hot oh why did I
just start like having any blush
okay so it's now 6:15 so it's been on
for a little over 9 hours and it has
held up pretty dang well I'm clearly a
little bit oily but it's not actually
breaking down underneath the oil I still
don't think it's like overly oily it
just kind of looks like dewy foundation
it's been on my upper lip and around my
nose where I thought I was gonna have
some creasing for me this amount of
creasing around my nose and everything
is really good they made this in a shade
that actually matched me I would totally
wear this with just a little bit of spot
concealer on I don't even think I really
need a powder
I could put a powder on if I wanted it
to look more matte but I actually like
this amount of glow I feel like it just
looks like healthier skin I'm gonna try
somehow mixing this so I'll update you
guys in the wrap-up video what I mix it
with and how it went I take notes on all
the foundation combinations I try from
this series for the wrap-up video so you
guys will kind of hear my final thoughts
in that video but I think this one is
beautiful if you want a medium coverage
kind of natural-looking foundation we're
having combo skin myself I think if
you're on the oily side you could make
this work if you're dry I don't know I
think this one could work too because it
does have this nice kind of glow to it I
don't see it clinging to any of my dry
patches or anything I'm actually kind of
surprised it didn't settle any more
because right when I first applied it
like I said I had that crease kind of up
here which didn't get worse throughout
the day and around my nose so I'm
listing this one could be nice on more
mature skin as well but if you guys have
tried this foundation and let me know
what you think of it down below do you
use it with a powder do you like it on
its own let us all know down below if
you guys are excited for a day 11 to 15
days foundation tomorrow don't forget to
give this video a thumbs up
love you guys thanks for watching see
you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
