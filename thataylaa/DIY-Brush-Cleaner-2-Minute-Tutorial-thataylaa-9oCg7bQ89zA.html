make your own a spot treatment brush
cleaner with stuff that you can find
around the house because we all know how
much it sucks they have to deep clean
your brushes I use this pretty much
every day and it helps to keep all the
product out of your brushes and keep
everything clean so here's the
ingredients and the things that we're
going to be adding we start out with an
empty measuring cup and the first thing
I'm going to do is add 1/2 a cup of
water next we're going to add 1/8 of a
cup of rubbing alcohol this is what's
going to help sanitize your brushes and
kill all the germs and bacteria you
should have this lying around your house
but if you don't you can get it at the
drugstore next we're adding 1/4 of a
tablespoon of shampoo
aka barely any I just like to use baby
shampoo because it's going to be less
harsh on the brush bristles but you can
use any shampoo that you have or that
you like the smell of then we're taking
a fourth of a tablespoon of laundry
detergent this helps to really cut out
the smell of that rubbing alcohol
so take one that you like the smell of
and once yours is cool and blue looking
like mine then we're going to go in and
mix it up
so you can use any spray bottle that you
have or that you like I just took a used
urban decay makeup setting spray bottle
and I peeled off the label and that's
what I like to use I already had it
laying around the house it's super easy
I'm just going to pour that in and then
you're good to go
you can shake it up whatever you want I
like to spray it directly on my brush
bristles but you can also spray on the
towel and do circular motions to get the
product out I just like spraying it
directly on the bristles it's up to you
and look at that magic I just love how
quick and easy this is if you found this
