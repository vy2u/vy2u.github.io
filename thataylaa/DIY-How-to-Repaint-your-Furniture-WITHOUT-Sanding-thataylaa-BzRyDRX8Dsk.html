just what you got to do yeah so today's
video was extremely extremely extremely
requested if you follow my Instagram you
have seen all of my DIY furniture
reviews in the past month ish it has
become an addiction of mine it's very
satisfying basically what I've been
doing is going to thrift stores finding
cheap cheap furniture and then
repainting them and refinishing them and
making them look like Pottery
Barn so I've gotten tons of questions
and Instagram comments and everything
about how the hell to do this it's
really easy basically I just did my own
research and figured out which products
I liked and which products were the best
to use so now I will pass that
information on to you guys I have this
huge ask box of my crafting supplies in
here so the first thing you need is a
piece of furniture or something you want
to redo all of the pieces I found were
either free or under about 20 dollars so
that keeps the cost low especially when
you have to buy supplies like paint and
everything like that you're looking for
a piece to redo you have to kind of see
potential in it if that makes sense
envision what color you want it a vision
how you want it to look and see if that
piece is right for that look and I'm
specifically talking about wood
furniture because that's what most
furniture is made out of when you get a
piece that is made of wood
usually people tell you to sand it I was
too lazy so I found a way around
that so I'm going to go from the
beginning kind of how to start your
project once you find a piece of
furniture the first thing you want to do
is cover your workspace I used an old
curtain basically I just had this that I
was going to get rid of and it's a
canvas material so it's nice and thick
for paintings you can just take down the
corners and then you have something to
cover up your floor and it smells
horrible if not you can find just like
$2 plastic sheets at Walmart that are
made for painting but
use what you have right so I kind of did
a very trial and error system when I was
working there's things that are going to
work for some people that don't work for
others so first I picked up this bad boy
which looks like some kind of cooking
concoction it's a paint roller and you
just put the foam thing on here you
slide it on and you can paint your
furniture using this I did not like this
at all it didn't give a smooth finish on
mine I had to use too much paint it just
didn't work for me instead of suggest
using a foam brush you can get these at
Dollar Tree for $0.99 anywhere Lowe's
Walmart whatever I actually don't like
this size I like the one that is half
this size um this works for bigger
pieces but the smaller one I don't know
you can just get in the little crevices
easier I just like it better as far as
actual paint goes for your wood
furniture if you're not going to sand
your furniture which you don't need to
if you use this there you sand it or not
you need to prime your piece if you are
not planning on sanding your furniture I
would suggest getting these insert cover
stain primer and this is a primer where
you don't need to sand the furniture
first it has enough like adherence that
the paint is just going to stick to the
primer so you can skip the whole sanding
step this is a battle I want to say like
eight to nine dollars at Lowe's this is
a life saver basically you use a foam
brush put two to three coats of this on
before you paint you have to let it
fully dry in between every coat I would
wait usually about like oh no half hour
to an hour between each coat before you
apply your paint if you don't prime your
furniture your paint is not going to
stick it's going to literally peel off
or change colors the stain of the wood
is going to come through you have to
prime your furniture as far as paint
goes I'm you know not a pro at this but
brand that I used is the Valspar latex
enamel if you're wondering all the
furniture that you have seen on
Instagram is in satin white that is the
color I used it worked fine nothing
really special to say about this there
are a lot of small things that you
realize you don't know how to do in life
when you go to do them for example
opening a
paint can head to YouTube how to open a
paint can so if you're like me and don't
know how basically you use a screwdriver
and a screwdriver where this called you
know I'm talking about the flat headed
ones and you have to slowly like peel up
around in a circle formation and then
when you're done so your paint doesn't
dry out you have to lightly hammer the
ends things you learn who would have
thought it was so hard to open a paint
can you want to get two to three cans if
you're painting multiple pieces of
furniture I think I ended up using about
two oh yeah yep I returned the third one
but better safe than sorry you know what
I mean you want to use your paintbrush
in the same direction when you're
painting you don't want to cross over
because you're going to see those paint
strokes you want to do two to three
coats and you want to make sure it's
completely completely dry in between
coats I forgot to mention this but
before you start painting you want to
remove all of the hardware and you don't
know what hardware is like little things
that pull out the drawers or whatever
and remove that by sliding out the
drawer and using a screwdriver and
unscrew the screws and it'll just come
right off you don't want to be lazy and
try to paint around them I tried that it
didn't work out well just do it you also
if you're painting something like a desk
you want to take out all of the drawers
and paint those separately you don't
want to do it while it's in the desk
it's just harder and then the paint
might dry and stick to the desk so that
would be kind of unuseful so after you
paint your piece and let it fully dry I
like to let it dry overnight before you
put on a sealant let it dry then you
want to use something like this I got
the rust-oleum a satin interior sealant
this is a finishing thing this is to put
over once you're done you need to use
this if you're using something that is
going to you know be used like a desk
for example if you're pulling out
drawers and stuff you don't want your
paint to chip off and this is going to
help that from not happening if you're
painting something like a mirror where
it's not going to get like touched and
dinged and everything you don't really
need to use this but I don't know I just
feel better
when
you have a sealant it's kind of like a
makeup setting spray you know what I
mean you don't need it but it just makes
your life so much easier and you just
feel so secure or I do this also needs
to I would put two coats just to be safe
for things like the mirror or like
smaller things like when I painted my
shelves up there I use the Krylon finish
spray and this is in the color white so
be careful when you're doing that you're
painting you know a colored piece you
obviously don't want to put a white
finishing spray overtop you just don't
so if you're you doing like smaller
things or whatever with a lot of like
nooks and crannies in them you just want
to use a spray that is everything as far
as how to actually do them anyone can do
this it's super easy and it's also just
fun like I actually really enjoy doing
this and it's a new hobby of mine I will
show you quick clips of the projects I
have done you want to see more pictures
