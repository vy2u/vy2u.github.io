create your own lipstick out of crayon
which is really awesome because you can
literally create any color lipstick that
you want we're gonna start out with
coconut oil you can find this at Target
or Walmart any of the supermarket pretty
much then we need some crayons obviously
I got these from Target and you're going
to need a container to put your finished
product in I just got these sample cups
from Mac you can go to any beauty
counter and they'll give you them or if
you have a palette or some kind of pan
that you want to use you can always use
that this is just a palette from ebay
you can just mold it into the pan and
then stick it in your palette and then
you're gonna need a candle and some kind
of small glassware to put everything in
and then for crayons this is a fun part
you can literally mix and match any kind
of colors that you want so it's up to
you so the first one I went with a red
lip if you mix and match colors you
basically just want to put equal to one
crayon we're gonna start off by peeling
the paper off of the crayon and this was
honestly the hardest part of this whole
project taking the coconut oil we're
gonna take about 3/4 of a spoon to one
half of a spoonful of this and then
place it in the glass bowl
to heat up the coconut oil I'm gonna
hold this about an inch to an inch and a
half away from the flame and just wait
for this to get warm once it starts
moving around you can go in with the
spoon and kind of mix it up to help it
heat up faster once your coconut oil is
completely melted we can go ahead and
put the crayons in I would put all of
them in at the same time just so it
stays the same consistency and same
thing you're just gonna wait for it to
mill it takes about five minutes and
then again you can mix it up once it's
completely melted we're going to take
our container that we're placing it in
with a spoon and just carefully put the
product inside it is super hot wax so be
careful if you get a little on the side
wait for it to cool down and then you
can scrape it off and then we're going
to go to the refrigerator put that in
set the timer for 15 minutes let it cool
and then we're good to go
once it's cooled down it's gonna look
something like this you can take a lip
brush or any kind of brush you have and
apply it to your lips and then I also
showed you how I made the blue one I
just mix three separate colors did the
same exact thing and I really love how
the blue one turned out I think it's
really fun to literally make any kind of
color lipstick that you want so make
sure if you like this tutorial you give
it a thumbs up and let me know down
below if you try it out and how you like
it thanks for watching and I will see
you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
