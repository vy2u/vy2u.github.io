hombre die dark hair like this did you
see it
okay I like to think of hombre like I do
with many aspects of my life less of a
 you give the better it's gonna turn
out it just seems to work like that feel
like hombre has been trendy for like two
years now can just waiting for it to go
out I don't know not going out but I
finally caught on and um this is how I
decided to UM braid out my hair I just
got the flu shot battle wound
so before I start I am NOT obviously a
hair stylist I didn't go to beauty
school this is just after doing research
this is the way I did it to just what
works for me I did my research found the
products and then I did it I have dyed
black hair which if you know anything
about color it is extremely hard to
change the color of your hair when it's
dyed black but you definitely need to
bleach it before you do anything to it
and you might even need to bleach it
more than one time to strip the color um
luckily my hair only had to bleach once
for the color to come out but it is
extremely damaged now just a heads up
all of the stuff that I used I got at
Sally's for bleach I use the L'Oreal
quick blue and this is just obviously a
giant tub of this I don't know why I
thought this was a good idea but this
was $15 on sale and the little packets
are like five dollars so I don't know
maybe I will be bleaching other people's
hair I don't know I literally don't know
when I'm ever going to use this point
again so what you do is you mix bleach
with developer and I have the salon care
30 volume cream developer I'm like out
of breath right now trying to film this
fast as a 30 volume extra lift cream
developer and then you're going to need
gloves a bowl and a brush you're just
going to mix the bleach with the
developer into this little bowl follow
the directions basically you want to
make it so it's a good consistency not
too liquidy not too thick you just want
to you know mix it and go to town so
once you have your bleach done you're
going to need foil
and basically what I did is I started at
the very ends of my hair where you want
it to be the lightest you obviously want
to bleach to stay on the longest there
the bottom about inch and a half to two
inches of my hair I put in foils first
just put the bleach on it let it sit for
about 25 minutes ish and just kind of
kept track checking back and making sure
that it was working and that it wasn't
you know on there too long if you keep
it on too long it's gonna completely fry
your hair so then you're just going to
work in layers so the next inch and a
half however it depends how far you want
your own braid to go up I obviously
wanted it a little more natural-looking
and I wanted it to blend into my hair so
I did the next two inches basically so
if you take a look at my hair it's
lighter at the end and then what I did
was just kind of piece it like the
bleach and I would just piece it instead
of taking a whole chunk of hair if that
makes sense so if you want a more
natural ombre look I would definitely
recommend piecing it like giving it a
highlighted look so it blends into your
hair instead of just being like blocks
of color keep in mind that the bleach is
going to look darker when it's on your
hair then after you've washed it out and
blow-dried it in your hair to dry but I
applied heat to the foil so once your
hair is covered in foiled blow dry it
the he's just going to activate the
color after I bleached my hair in the
shower
I used this bad boy tensive repair
protein builder Reconstructor you can
get this at Sally's for 279 just left on
the shower for like 10 minutes and it's
just going to put the protein back in
your hair so it's not going to be as
damaged but yeah get that then it just
depends how your hair lifts the color
but mine was a little bit more brassy
than I wanted it had too much orange
tones in it so in order to counteract
that I got the mullet owner in t18 and
then the Wella developer I'm not sure if
you can use the same developer but this
is the 20 volume and it goes with this
so I got those hide it you're supposed
to apply it to towel-dried hair not dry
hair and it's just a toner so it looks
purple when you put on your hair once
you wash out your toner you're good to
go
it's super easy
I don't know if that helps but these are
just the products that I used and how I
did it it's all up to you use your
creativity have fun I also wanted to say
that I got a lavaca C account which is
really cool but the products I mentioned
