could get this sentence out that would
be fabulous any time I wear a middle
part I just think of that murderer who
only murdered women with middle parts am
I the only one I'm like 99% sure it was
Ted Bundy
I feel like Mallory might know the
answer this nothing like I talked about
murderers and a foundational video to
start off your day I'm all right
all right so today it is foundation fry
this is where we try out a new
foundation every single Friday on my
channel today's foundation is a product
that pretty much went viral and
Instagram I'm sure we've all seen a
video of this at one point or another
there was a video of a girl that had a
little bit of acne and she used this to
cover it up and you guys flooded the DMS
with that video saying that you wanted
to see this tested so this is by Wonder
2 which is the same brand that made
Wonder brow this is their cover proof
foundation I actually ordered this about
two months ago and was planning on
including this in 15 days of foundation
but the package literally disappeared in
the mail so I ended up ordering this off
of Amazon and said their website this
time so let's hop on and read some of
the claims I'm gonna have my foundation
Friday please listed down below in case
you want to go watch other ones
literally my Google search right now is
murderer middle hair part Mallory just
got back and confirmed yes it is Ted
Bundy I love you know that I would know
this okay let's go back to Linda brow
wonder whatever this is called so its
foundation retails for about $30 it only
comes in five shades which is obviously
a major downside I have the lightest
shade which is fair you guys will see
what I think of that shade you get a
standard one fluid ounce of product in
here this is what the packaging looks
like I actually think it's pretty ugly
feels a bit cheap it just reminds me of
like medical something I don't know or
like skincare I'm just not that into
packaging the description of this says
finally a long lasting foundation that
you can count on create the perfect
canvas and transform your skin for 24
hours 24 hours blah blah blah this
lightweight foundation remains ultra
comfortable and flexible on the skin
ensuring your base stays fresh and
nourished all day
glowy natural transfer proof an even
pillow proof after those late nights
basically the main points are high
coverage transfer proof 24-hour wear
natural glow apparently it has a polymer
called poly glow that leaves the skin
looking flawless i minister some
swatches right here of the lightest
shade fair compared to some of the other
foundations that I own alright swatch
time I just discovered that the pump on
this thing is way hard to get a tiny bit
amount out so I have a giant swatch
right here but first right here is the
Wonder to cover proof foundation in the
lightest shade and ten fair next over
Urban Decay Naked skin and
point-five maybelline fit me matte and
poreless in 110 derma called 2:08 milk
makeup blur liquid and fair pur
cosmetics bare at all in porcelain and
Marc Jacobs remarkable in 10 so I solved
the claims and everything on this
foundation if you guys are excited for
foundation Friday don't forget to give
this video a thumbs up if you're new
here you can join the baby doe family
and subscribe I upload Monday Wednesday
Fridays 6 p.m. Pacific time my accutane
disclaimer when you guys are seeing this
I'm currently on accutane so this is a
pre-recorded video let's jump into it if
you want to see what I think of the
cover proof foundation and how to apply
somewheres throughout the day you're in
the right place just keep watching ok so
it's actually 1 p.m. right now I usually
start these videos first thing in the
morning so we can do a full super long
wear test but I had a few things said to
do this morning so I'm gonna keep this
one on as long as possible so Friday
wash moisturize in prime my face I used
a primer on half of my face again the
right side why is it so hot in here
right now
I only primed this out of my face so
we'll see if there's the difference
again use my ELF ultimate blending brush
on one side and I my morphe sponge on
the other there's only 5 shades so
hoping the shade fair will match I'm
gonna shake this just in case it does
have a pump so I'm gonna pump a bit of
this out on the back of the palette so
that's the shade looks a bit dark but
we'll see I'm gonna dab some of this on
and start out with a brush on this out
of my face has a very orange tone to it
let's see how this covers feels pretty
thick
yeah it has like a tug to it almost so
the shade is definitely dark I don't
know if you guys can see that on camera
but probably at least a shade dark
hoping this doesn't oxidize not covering
all of this at all
looks like about medium covered with the
brush I do have my ring lay off right
now and I have the natural light coming
in again you should be able to see yeah
it feels pretty sticky like almost like
a gel a lot of texture a bit of dryness
up here on my forehead and it's
definitely clinging to everything ok
don't necessarily like how that looks
with the brush let's see this sponge
helps a little bit doesn't seem to be
covering my acne at all so this is the
not primed side even lighter coverage
with this bun
that didn't really cover anything but
the finish does look better with a
sponge someone needs to do an ASMR video
of just a meaty blender it smoothing
over my forehead with a sponge
definitely helps with the finish and the
texture yeah finished looks much better
with a sponge so my acne is out to party
right now I definitely would need to
spot conceal I'm gonna see if we can
build it up with a sponge definitely
building high medium coverage on this
side you can still see freckles and
stuff coming through but it's covering
my acne a lot better if I want to build
up a foundation I usually focus out only
on the spots where I have my acne like
I'm not bringing it right around my nose
or anything because I do get creasing
there so my upper lip nose area I
usually disavowed if I'm doing a second
layer so it's not too much product there
I think it's going on the same and looks
pretty much the same prime site versus
not prime side a sponge is definitely
the way to go with this one it looked
like a different foundation sponge
versus brush size much more smooth with
the sponge and the center of my forehead
now in my forehead looks pretty good
after smoothing it over with a sponge I
feel like it's already starting to
oxidize I don't know why but the shade
never shows up on camera as it is in
real life it's about a shade too dark
right now I still wouldn't say this like
covers acne even on two layers I mean
everything is like still coming in on my
neck down here I'm actually gonna just
put concealer on my neck I'm not gonna
put this on my face I just need to cover
that up on my neck I think I actually
like how it looks the most on my
forehead it looks nice and smooth air
around my nose area it already looks
like it's starting to crease on my upper
lip a bit a little bit my pores don't
look super great
doesn't look bad down here I just
wouldn't say I'm like in love with how
my skin looks right now right now it's
120 very tacky I'm gonna give this a few
minutes while I do my eye makeup and see
if it kind of sets down and if it
doesn't I'm gonna powder my face so I'll
be right back once I have the rest of my
makeup on and have drinks more coffee
okay so it's pretty much 2 o'clock we're
gonna call the check-in time 1:20 since
that's when I finished up with my face I
did not end up powdering my entire face
all I did was put a little bit of the
Laura Geller powder
just literally right here so I could
blend my powder products on top because
it is still tacky so I did the rest eye
makeup and then I went out and looked in
the mirror out there and in my bathroom
there and it looks good like I don't
know if it just warmed up to my face or
what just happened but my forehead looks
bomb I think mostly because I don't have
acne there so like it looks more full
coverage but the center of my forehead
looks amazing it just looks very smooth
and flattering up there there are some
areas down here where it doesn't look
the best kind of like clinging to my
acne and then around my notes I have a
feeling it's gonna not look so great
throughout the day right here because it
is already starting to crease and my
pores look pretty big okay so this is
right after I just applied it I just
want to show you guys what it looks like
out here and natural light and red
natural lighting for some reason I feel
like the only place the shade really
shows up accurate is when I do it in the
mirror so you can see right here that's
where the foundation ends definitely too
dark but for some reason I flip the
camera and I'm facing the other way it
looks like it matches but I think this
one off the bat I would probably mix in
something to lighten it and also add a
bit more coverage might try mixing it
with derma coal because right now I
really like the finish of it I feel like
it's one of those that just needs to
kind of warm up to your skin a little
bit but we'll see how it holds up
throughout the day so on the rest of my
face for contour and all the matte
shadows on my eyes I use the Tarte clay
play palette I need to like mentally
prepare to say those three words this is
just such a bomb neutral palette it is
great for blush I use the Make Up For
Ever blush I've been obsessed with this
one right here I'll have the exact
number listed down below highlight I
first attempted to use the Sephora
Golden Hour in the shade oh oh no in the
shade Twilight zero for this is like
straight up purple ended up going over
it with the J cat you blow girl to kind
of like light in it because I mean my
highlight looked like purple so I kind
of have a mix of these two as my
highlight right now this one I'm not
that into it all what else oh so on the
rest of my eyes for the lid shade I used
L'Oreal 2:07 this is so freaking pretty
this isn't even wet that was just used
with a brush even super pretty like cool
toned purplish gray and then for my
corner I used Milani Bella pink which is
super pretty this is the first time I
use the shade it's like a reflective
super light purple utter line eyeliner
has color pop honey Jude and then for
lips I use the 32 innocent liner by
Rimmel with the new Mac Nicki Minaj
lipstick this is in the shade the pink
print and this is a very pink so I kind
of had to tone it down with some lip
gloss so then I put on my favorite mu a
baby pink if you haven't tried this yet
this is like my go-to lip gloss I keep
this in my purse
I just put a couple of drops of tea tree
oil in it so it smells better I know it
smells amazing so check back in with you
guys in a few hours in natural lighting
okay not sure why I'm blue right now but
it is now it's now 6:30 so it's been on
for five hours I think it still looks
really good I'm gonna zoom you guys in I
feel like it looks a little bit more
oily than earlier on my forehead but
it's not to the point where I feel like
it's too oily I kind of like the dew
eNOS it's not separating so that's a
good sign
it's kicking up a little bit around my
nose area which is kind of typical for
me it doesn't look the best on my acne I
think that's my only thing with this is
that it does cling kind of weird yeah
you can kind of see it looks a little
bit clingy and dry and then around my
nose area on both sides primed and not
I'm gonna try and keep the Sun as late
as possible I'm gonna have a cup of
coffee to stay awake and I'll check back
in with you guys at the end of the night
okay so it's 11:10 I made it the full 10
hours I'm pretty proud of myself
so it's been on for 10 hours I'm
actually in front of the ring light
right now just dimmed it so as you can
see I am very oily also it's playing
back some of the footage because it's
started editing this video and I
realized I was wearing this exact
sweatshirt in the last foundation Friday
video I'm gonna do it right now so
anyways very very very oily I feel like
it didn't start though until about 8
hours in I think 7 hours I was still
like dewy now I'm just super oily but
it's not breaking down like a tiny tiny
bit right on the center of my forehead a
super tiny bit on the center of my
forehead and it still doesn't look great
around my nose area but even on my chin
with the oil like it doesn't seem to be
really breaking down I'm just i li i
don't know this one i'm kind of confused
why because i feel like if i put on a
powder it would have looked too heavy
because it didn't start looking skin
like until like an hour in when I liked
ah got a little bit dewy so I think if I
did powder my face I would have to like
put on the foundation wait a bit and
then powder also just be too heavy
looking let's go in this light because I
feel like this light for some reason
more accurately shows how dark yeah so
in here you can see I do think it's
oxidized about a shade throughout the
day I want to say I think if I mix this
one I would mix it with something that's
super long-lasting and too light
and add a little bit of coverage I kind
of porn thoughts on this one overall I
don't really think it's worth purchasing
I feel like I have foundations that give
the same kind of effect that lasts
longer on my skin that have a little bit
more coverage in the don't oxidize so
for me I don't think this one really
makes sense to buy but I don't think
it's a bad foundation if you have oily
skin probably not the one for you not
sure how it would work on
my skin but it didn't really cling to
any of my dryness on my forehead again
after that like hour I wouldn't say it's
like this revolutionary foundation or
anything it doesn't cover quite as much
as I expected feel like if you're gonna
call it cover proof it should probably
be like full coverage right it is late
and need to shower I need to go to bed
and I'm gonna film another friend Asian
video tomorrow I have two weeks
pre-recorded and I'm trying to get at
least eight weeks pre-recorded before I
start acting like I'm doing like 15 days
foundation again right now but you guys
can always let me know what foundations
you want to see next my skin type is
definitely gonna change after accutane
I'm guessing so I'm trying to do the
foundations that I already bought that I
think are more for like oily skin or
acne so I'm trying to get all of those
done but definitely let me know down
below if there are any specific ones you
want to see reviewed while my skin is
still this type if you enjoy foundation
