night hey you know I love you
I've already had three cups of coffee
today onto my fourth coffee makes the
world go around am i recording right now
yes so I am super curious about this
Clarisonic came out with a vibrating
foundation brush head that you can
basically attach to any of their
Clarisonic devices I have the Clarisonic
Mia fit which is obviously a bit bulkier
than the original Clarisonic with like
the handle actually use the vanity
planet cleansing tool more than I use my
Clarisonic firstly I'm not a fan of
holding this thing it just feels like
ridiculously bulky to me
so this brush head retails for $35 all
you do is twist off the brushes that you
currently have on so when you're
attaching the brush I do want to keep
this plastic thing on because it's going
to make your life way easier you
basically just push down and twist and
then pull up there we go
why am I losing my voice right now I
haven't felt this yet feels super soft
feel soft not quite as soft as I was
expecting for some reason but I wouldn't
say it's like scratchy or anything I'm
going to quickly read some of the claims
about this brush edge just so we can
know what it's supposed to do then I'm
going to put on my face so it says get
better foundation coverage while using
less foundation with the sonic
foundation brush head for an even
flawless finish
you can even contour and highlight with
this with cream products it says do not
use this with powder products utilizes
oscillation technology to generate more
than 18,000 micro blends per minute it
says they're supposed to provide a
flawless full foundation coverage look
in 60 seconds or less so to clean this
you could either spot clean it with like
a spray or you definitely want to do a
deep clean like you would with your
normal foundation brushes where you just
take this off and clean it does it has
non-porous bristles so the foundation
isn't supposed to sink in here I am
really curious about this because it
feels very flimsy typically for me I get
the best coverage stippling on my
foundation with a more dense brush I
love the Sigma f80 to the Sigma f80
morphe 31 those are kind of my go-to
foundation brushes to give you some
comparison this feels much more flimsy
than those it's not super densely packed
I'm going to try it with obviously
Foundation and also I'm going to try it
with cream contour blush and highlight
it says it covers imperfections such as
blemishes and acne scars better than
hands so it doesn't say necessarily
supposed to cover acne better than a
foundation brush I'm kind of debating
doing one half of my face with this and
one half with my little
coopering one half with my normal
foundation brush a foundation that I'm
going to be using is a lower Deller
cover lock foundation because when I'm
so
this I'm still testing out foundations
for the rapid video for 15 days of
foundation if you missed that syriza
link it down below in the description
box you guys will have already seen the
rapid video but this is definitely one
of my favorites from a series the
coverage is unreal and you don't have to
use a lot of projects so I'm curious to
see if I have to use even less product
with this it already wash moisturize and
pry my face so I'm using these two
products to prep my skin and I have been
in love this is the Urban Decay hot
springs hydration gel rehab makeup prep
this is awesome for underneath
foundation absorbs into your skin really
quickly and it just gives you a smooth
kind of finish and then I put the high
malade matte 12 primer just in my t-zone
area since I do get oily throughout the
day and I actually feel like this helps
my oil so my skin doesn't have any kind
of stick to it right now foundation
should blend fine on top of it what else
do I need to say visit I'm excited
so the me if it has two different speed
settings on it let's test this out this
sounds freaking intense if you have a
roommate you might want to warn them
that you're using a face brush not
another fun tool so I'm definitely going
to go with the first setting very
intense I'm going to show you guys a
close-up of this
let's get situated here need my mirror I
feel like maybe I should remove the
hoops this could be hazardous this is
about what I would use on this area
normally so if we do have too much I can
just bring it up to my forehead or the
other side of my face alright let's do
this so left okay so curious you're
supposed to use circular motions
whoa okay hair came out can you guys
even hear me with this vibration thing
oh no no it's not to go around your eye
area
it's probably just don't want you
nailing yourself in the eyeball okay so
the timer just went off so I'm gonna
have to hit go again so it is shedding
I've gotten three hairs coming out so
far for using circular motions I feel
like I'm getting really good coverage so
when I use circular motions with a brush
now actually like I'm screaming because
this vibration was it loves when I use
circular motions with a regular
foundation brush I don't typically get
good coverage I really have to stipple
it on to get the kind of coverage I like
but doing this I've actually gotten good
coverage I didn't put any down here so
it's not covering any of my acne down
here but just on this area I would say
I'm getting the same kind of coverage I
don't think I'm getting any higher
coverage and I did use about the same
amount of product but I'm going to go
ahead and put a little bit more just on
my neck to blow this down and maybe a
tiny bit more just on the acne right
here it doesn't look like it's sinking
into the bristles of a lot which is
promising yeah that blended out really
quick and got really good coverage so it
looks very smooth with this foundation I
don't think the product went any further
than it normally would well and it is
majorly shedding we got some more
stragglers I'm going to try it on my
forehead on this side and see I'm
debating if I want to do a normal brush
just so we can compare I don't know if I
think it looks that much better than
with a normal brush but maybe we'll just
do the other half because I am curious
it's gonna do a tiny amount and see how
far that goes on my forehead
it's easy to work with around the
hairline I don't feel like it's getting
caught in my hairline really blended out
really nicely on my forehead it looks I
mean it looks good I am going to do a
normal brush on the other half of my
face because I really want to see if
there's any kind of difference some use
my ELF brush is not technically for
foundation but it's one of my favorites
to blend out foundation I'll have the
exact one listed down below it's a few
bucks so this will be a good comparison
to see if $35 brush head is actually
worth it I'm going to go in with about
the same amount let's just see so this
is typically how I apply my foundation
in kind of stippling motions this is how
I get the best coverage with the least
amount of product it could just be with
this foundation but I did get better
coverage on this side this one is
complete full coverage I would say with
the brush head I would say it's high
coverage and you can still see my
freckles and stuff coming through on
this side now she looks a tiny bit
smoother to me on this side I'm going to
show you guys close-up so you can see
what I'm talking about all right so
here's the Clarisonic side and then
here's what the elf foundation brush it
looks nice it doesn't look bad at all
blend it out fine I just don't know if I
would pay $75 for it when I got better
coverage on this side it did a good job
blending it out on my forehead since I
didn't get quite the same amount of
coverage I'm going to go in for like a
tiny second layer just on areas where I
feel like I need it this summer thing
I'm actually going to try dip in the
Clarisonic into this foundation on the
palette so I just swirled it right there
let's just see how that goes why not
think I like that method better could
you see because it's a second layer so
obviously it's going to look like more
coverage feel like that applied it a
little bit better I've got to say it's
hard for me to like slow down like I
feel like I usually blend super fast and
with this you kind of have to just let
it do the work and just do slow motions
I kind of have a natural tendency to
want to blend but this thing is doing
the blending for us they just kinda have
to chill it looks really good now I
think I actually prefer dipping it
directly into the product I like that
you can do that and it doesn't like
spray the product everywhere it looks
really nice I don't think it looks bad
I'm just trying to debate in my head
whether I would pay $35 for this it does
look very flawless super smooth acted
it's rotating and I got this good of
coverage is good sign to me so I'm gonna
apply my concealer and I'll be right
back so we can test out other cream
products all right so I did concealer
brows and a little bit of eye makeup I'm
actually filming a winged liner tutorial
after this so didn't put any eyeliner on
I did not set my under eyes yet because
anytime you use cream products you don't
want to be putting it on top of the
powder so we using the Maybelline master
contour stick I rarely use cream
products cream products are not my
favorite I've just always preferred
powder products but we're testing this
out going to put it on level one again
that blended out really easily I feel
like this is very actually like that was
a lot quicker than using a sponge just
cream products I actually didn't really
take off a whole lot of the product
underneath it that's another one of my
issues with cream products when I blend
it sometimes it blends away the
foundation and coverage underneath but
this I feel like did not I'm going to
use this REM will stay blushed touch of
berry I remember doing a video on these
when they first came out years ago I
don't remember how much does you need
okay that does not look the best might
just be the product but I feel like that
did blend away some of my coverage I
don't really want to do that on the
other side my skin is always weird with
cream products like that part of the
reason why I don't use it I'm actually
not going to do the blush on this side
because I want to keep my foundation on
but let's go ahead and try this
highlight out I've been meaning to try
this this is the AL Jeunesse reveal
concentrated luminizing drops I think I
got this in the sephora play blocks or
something probably a lot let's do this
highlight
Oh a lot oh that's blending out really
nicely and you don't have to press hard
it all with this step blend it out
really nicely so I'm gonna apply the
rest of my makeup and then I'll be back
to tell you guys my final thoughts on
this thing alright so the rest of my
make was on I think I found my new
favorite bronzer I've been using this
past few days this is the new shade of
the hourglass ambient lighting bronzers
is diffused bronze light it looks super
bizarre in the pan like there's more
White's than brown in here but it is
such a beautiful color if you have a
similar complexion to mine all the
makeup on my face is always listed down
below but then I use the hourglass
incandescent Elektra blush super pretty
also the Casey Holmes Smashbox palette I
use this on my cheeks as a highlight and
on my eyes this is all that's on my lid
as eyeshadow and my inner corner and
then lips you're probably sick of seeing
this combination but I'm addicted to it
this is the Rimmel 32 innocent with
Sephora 32 it's released about 32 so
final thoughts on the foundation brush I
think it's a good product I think it
blends it out easily it doesn't
necessarily take away coverage I
wouldn't say I got more coverage with
it's in the brush for me personally I
don't know how much I'd actually use
this just because this device is pretty
bulky because I had the other clothes on
I put the handle but for traveling and
everything I mean the size and the
weight of this compared to a foundation
brush unless you were already taking or
Clarisonic is just a lot heavier and
bulkier so first it seems a little bit
weird to media is the same tool that
used to cleanse and get into your pores
to put product on that seems like your
doll mostly getting too deep into your
pores but it does say that this is
supposed to sit nicely on Tadas and have
that same kind of effect they use to
cleanse your face so it's the actual
product I think they did a great job I
think it works beautifully it blended
out easily for me $35 I don't know if
it's totally worth it for me this isn't
something that I would probably reach
for on a daily basis just because I got
better coverage with the brush and it's
just easy and quick if you've been
wanting to try out a rotating foundation
brush or something like this this is
definitely the best one I've tried I
have tried a few others this one does
work so if you're in the market for it
are you curious about it I do think this
one could be worth to go for you so hope
you guys enjoyed this video and found it
helpful if you did make sure you give it
a thumbs up I'm going to go film the
eyeliner video this technically is
foundation Friday but like I told you
guys in the wrap-up foundation Friday
first impressions are going to be
zooming in a couple weeks so next week
there still will be videos Monday
Wednesday Friday but there won't be a
foundation Friday video love you guys
thanks for watching see my next video
bye it's just going to make your life
way easier if you can just twist it on
so I can get it in the right crevice
there we go
so that okay I did not do that very well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
