been quite the week let me tell you it's
my first time filming in the new
apartment this is all going to change
you guys should see this room right now
there's literally cardboard boxes all
around me filming lights like stashed
between boxes and clothes kind of a
show so it's going to be fun the
lighting background everything is going
to be changing I did my best to get the
lighting as good as possible for today
but let's jump into foundation Friday
this weird Crowder thing so I wasn't
originally planning on doing a full
video on this because they actually
included this in the shadow and schmooze
I think like a month ago now right when
this first came out in the past couple
weeks I've gotten a ton of requests from
you guys to do a video on this so I
figured I would do a foundation Friday
on this and test it in a couple
different ways when I first try it out
in the shadow movies I didn't do a wear
test or anything if you ever want to
know if I've talked about a product in a
video all you have to do is search the
name of the product plus the Tayla and
youtube search and it'll come up magic
so if you have not heard of this thing
this is a new Urban Decay velvet Iser
powder this is basically a power that
you can mix in with your foundation it's
supposed to make it more match and add
more coverage or you can wear it on top
of your foundation just as like a
finishing powder
whenever you some of the claims on Urban
Decay's website it's 34 dollars and you
get 0.28 ounce of the product
it says mix in a dime sized amount of
this product to create an extra velvety
feel beautiful matte finish and added
coverage the result is silky airbrush
looking skin because it doesn't mess
with the color of your other products
and make Simpson shouldn't affect the
shade at all ultrafine addictively
luxurious luxurious spent a long weeks
luxurious feel and I think that's about
it so this morning I worked out did all
of my errands so I wouldn't have to
leave the house today because I'm going
to test this in kind of a weird way I'm
going to do like a half face test so if
it looks at the Tzar we're all good I'm
just staying in so what I'm going to do
is on half my face mix it in with
foundation and on the other half I am
NOT going to mix it in with foundation
I'm just going to apply the foundation
but then use it as a setting powder so
you can see how it wears throughout the
day which way might work better for you
I'm really here to see if the side that
I mix it in actually adds coverage
foundation I'm going to be mixing it in
with on both sides as elf acne fighting
foundation the reason I'm using this one
is because
as a I have self-tanner on right now
hence why I don't blend in with the wall
I put on for fourth of July when I'm
filming this it's the sixth I'm kind of
feeling it I feel like the shade is
pretty natural
but anyways foundation I think this
shade should work pretty well to match
my body I know this one is too dark on
its own for me usually I've already
prepped my skin with my Urban Decay
rehab makeup practice what I always used
and for about the past week I've been
using the number 7 airbrush away primer
and this thing is bomb I feel like I
actually kind of smooth out your skin
though I'm going to keep trying this one
out but I am going to be using it today
since I've been using it for like I said
a week let's do this and we'll be using
the elf brush to apply my foundation so
first I think I'm going to apply the
foundation on this side by itself so we
can see how much coverage it has on its
own and the finish without mixing in the
powder going on with foundation why do I
feel like I'm forgetting to do something
wash moisturizer primer face here we go
so I think this shade might actually be
too late with self-tanner on sees
yeah let me go digging for foundations
and see what we can do my makeup is not
unpacked at all so wish me luck ok so I
took that off and just read primed that
side of my face I'm going to try the
covergirl vitalist health elixir in 710
I did a full review on this product I
loved it actually like the main reason
why I picked up self-tanner because I
wanted just to match my body 7/10 I
think will work because I wore this the
other day and this foundation is very
dewy on its own super glowy so that'll
be good to see how it mattifies it and
then it's also not completely completely
full coverage off of one layer so we'll
see if this adds coverage to definitely
too light I think I'm just going to have
to use a ton of bronzer it's looking
even lighter on camera in real life it
doesn't look that off but it definitely
is about a shade too light suppose to
use a dime sized amount that's for a
full face so I'm going to use about same
amount of foundation and then mix in a
little bit less than a dime sized amount
just we're only doing half my face right
now so the actual powder in here is
super finely milled like I said I have
tried this before so I know how it feels
and everything so this is probably the
most finely milled powder I've ever felt
it does feel like not velvety but just
makes your skin feel super super super
soft has a bit of a yellow tint to it in
the container so I'm just going to dab
dab towards I don't know is that enough
that is how much powder I put out in
foundation
the cool thing when you mix this is that
it doesn't get like weird clumpy it just
mixes really well so off the bat just on
here it definitely looks more matte
weightless running than the foundation
on its own
whoo I forgot that this also oxidizes
which is good right now because I think
this will actually match my face in a
few minutes
whoa okay if you can see just trying to
get it off my finger definitely thicker
I feel like the color is different is
that just me it looks a little bit
darker and more yellow to me so I
already almost used up that amount so I
feel like that didn't go quite as far as
the other side but it is mattifying it
can't really tell uncovered yet okay
yeah I need to mix a little bit more how
to kind of like aid up some of the
liquids so I would mix a little bit more
than you usually use you could probably
kind of customize it depending on how
matte and everything you want it just
makes them less powder I'm assuming it's
looking a tiny bit cakey on the side of
my face basically on the areas of my
face where I don't have acne it's
looking really good but where I have
more texture and acne like around here
and up on my forehead
it's definitely clinging a little bit
and it's not looking the best I want to
say it looks horrible but I do like how
this side of my face is sitting better
on my acne I don't think it added any
coverage coverage to me looks the same
and try and build this up a little bit
and just see if it builds man it doesn't
look bad built up a little bit right
there but I'm not going to do the rest
of my face because I don't think it
looks any better this is oxidized and
it's definitely mashing me better okay
for some reason when I Pat this in with
my finger it's looking a lot better
what's the heck I don't know if like the
warmth of my hand is helping to kind of
melt it in or what but it looks way
better this is like finger magic right
now it's like taking away the texture
and now it looks really nice alright
looking in my mirror in real life this
side does look darker so I do think it
alters the shade a tiny bit now I'm
going to use this as a setting powder
only on this half of my face setting
powder I always use the furless cb4
brush it's just a really nice like dense
brush and I feel like this gives me the
best coverage with powders and it
doesn't cause any weird texture things
it's going to tap some this into the lid
I'm not a big fan of loose powders some
time's it takes the way the coverage of
my foundation it's very bizarre but it
happens to me with a lot of loose
powders which is why I usually stick
with pressed powders so I'm just going
to dip in here kind of swirl it around
tap off the excess there's a lot flying
off since it's superfine and when I
apply my powder I just like to pounce it
on I don't blend because if I have like
a sticky foundation in blend I just
blend away all of the coverage oops I
totally forgot under-eye concealer what
am i doing right now I'm just gonna rub
that powder off a little I didn't
totally like powder my whole eye so I
think it'll be okay
I'm using Maybelline instant age rewind
concealer it's super nice having this
tan because I can use products that I
can't usually use under my eyes
here's to see how concealer blends on
top of here since it does have the
powder mixed in on this half of my face
seems to be blending out totally fine on
top of there this side is okay seeing a
little texture but it's I'm not using
this to set my under eyes because there
is not a single loose powder on planet
earth that works underneath my eyes so
back to powdering this part of my face I
think I got that part pretty good let's
do the forehead touching my face it
feels super soft aside feels matte
enough to where I'll be able to blend
product on top of it but it doesn't have
the same like super soft feel I can't
like glide my finger across it this side
I would say a hundred percent looks
better than this side up close as I'm
editing the stack I noticed that huge
white stripes on the right side of my
face I'm not sure if it was just
lighting I couldn't see it or what or
just the HD camera was picking it up
more than I could see it in real life
but there's definitely like a white kind
of cast to this at least where i clunked
part of my face on top of the liquid
foundation it just looks like I have
kind of like a heavier foundation on now
that I put that powder on top I do think
on my skin it took away a little bit of
the coverage but again that usually
happens with me but it looks really
smooth as a setting powder it looks very
natural really smooth so I'm going to
the rest of my makeup off-camera but I
do want to show you guys putting on
bronzer just you can see how powder
blends on top of both so right now it's
1:20 in the afternoon that's and we're
going to call the check-in time I've
been freaking obsessed with this bronzer
this is the Kevin and Quan bronzing veil
and tropical night I got this in New
York I use this when I didn't have to
tanner on and I've also used it while I
have the Tanner on and I think this is
literally the perfect bronzer the exact
shade and everything that I've been
looking for so what I've been doing is
using my wet and wild brush and just
going in with that light shade to
contour and then using like a fluffier
brush to warm up my face can see the
products stuff more on the side and as
soon as I put it on I could feel that
this one wasn't going to blend out quite
as easily
it almost looks a little bit muddy on
this side this side is just like easily
blending on top of that powder the
check-in time is 1:20 like I said I'm
going to do the rest of my makeup and
I'll be right back so it's not 2:13 so
it's been on for almost an hour I'm
going to show you guys what it looks
like in natural lighting in a second but
on the rest of my face let me tell you
what's on it I'll show you this
positions formula butter blush and rosy
pink on what my buns doing focal point
for a highlight I tried out to cover
naquan matte to glow Neos setting powder
I just went in with like the more matte
side I guess but definitely not matte
all of my eyeshadows are from the jaclyn
hill morphe palette which I'm still
trying out this video was pre filmed so
I just want to let you guys know if you
want to know my thoughts on it head to
Instagram I posted a little summary of
what I think of it lashes are black
magic lashes and charm these are really
short but I like it if I just want like
volume at the base my lips rbuil is a
lipstick and natural nude which looks
totally different on me when I don't
have tanner on and I think that's
everything I'll give you guys a little
update on what I think of it when we're
in natural lighting here we go so my
vlog camera completely broke on me a
couple days ago so I'm just filming on
the iPhone need to get a replacement but
I wanted to show you guys in natural
lighting regardless because I walked out
here and my space on this side using it
as a setting powder looks frickin move
it doesn't look bad on this side but I'm
already starting to get creasing on my
upper lip on this side on this side I
don't at all it just looks very smooth
on this side I just think on my skin
it's working better as a setting powder
versus mixing it in
alright so snow 7:15 I can't show you
guys the time because
fill me on the phone but my face has
been on for six hours now see how
everything's looking so off the bat this
side still looks much better this side
I'm not getting really any creasing
around my nose is still looks really
smooth the forehead on the setting
powder side definitely still looks
better with a little bit less textured
so here's a close hopefully you can see
this but there's some creasing almost
like cakiness a little bit around my
nose on this side and then my lip is
creasing right here I'm getting a little
bit of lip creasing on this side but it
looks a lot better around my nose I
usually get pretty oily throughout the
day and right now I think oil wise my
skin on both sides looks pretty good it
looks about the same I think a little
bit more oily on this side around here
on my nose so I'll check back in with
you guys at the end of the night all
right so it's now 1124 like ten minutes
trying to find the best semi-decent
lighting to do the final check-in in I
think this is as good as we're going to
get without the ring light right now
definitely be better once I have my blog
camera back but also it'll probably just
take me a little bit to get everything
down with lighting and new space and all
that there we go okay so looking at my
face I definitely still think I like the
side using it as setting powder better
on my skin I think mixing in the powder
just made me look a little bit textured
and too much around my nose on this side
is kicking up more than on this side
this side looks actually pretty good I'm
a little tiny bit shiny but nothing bad
at all if anything it just kind of
rubbed off right here so swear I had my
hand as a working I don't think this
side looks bad but because it didn't add
any extra coverage or anything there's
not really a point to me to mix it in
because this side looks like I held up
just as well and it's just a little bit
less heavy looking to me I think this
one will just depend your skin and
texture and everything how it mixes in
with foundation overall for me I like it
best as a setting powder but I mean if
you're going to buy it you can try it
both ways so I think it's worth buying
it just as a setting powder I think it
looks really nice it feels super soft on
my skin it doesn't look quite as
flawless as I saw it on like Casey
Holmes it looked amazing on her
so might just depend on your skin I
don't know for me I would just
we buy it just because I feel like I
have other loose powders that do similar
things for me I won't be mixing it in
with foundations but if you guys have
tried the velvet Iser let me know what
you think of it down below do you like
it best mixed in do you wear it by
itself
do you wear underneath liquid foundation
I might actually try that let me know
your thoughts on it but I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did make sure
you give it a thumbs up love you guys
thanks for watching see you my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
