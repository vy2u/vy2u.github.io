makeup without looking so this is a no
mirror makeup challenge this video has
been around on YouTube for like a decade
at this point I've only done this one
time it was actually on a live stream a
couple years ago I've never done a
YouTube video don't ask me how I've been
on YouTube for 6 years now
I keep saying 6 years but I'm pretty
sure that number hasn't changed in like
two years however long I've been on
YouTube I've never done this video so
we're gonna try it out today so if
you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up
wish me luck if you're new here you can
join the baby toe family and subscribe I
upload every Monday Wednesday Friday 6
p.m. Pacific time I'm going to now cover
up my monitor so I'm gonna cover it up
with a sweater and I'm just gonna leave
out the little corner that has the
recording dot just so I can make sure
that we're still talking and on this is
so weird cuz I can't see myself at all
but I am now removing the mirror I have
no mirrors I'm also gonna obviously try
and not use any of the mirrors in any of
the pallets or not look at them this
already feels so bizarre ok let's start
out with my usual primer so I'm gonna
spray on some two base three and one I
think I'm just gonna go in with my NARS
mmm what do I always want to call it
ultra radiant what does NARS you guys
know it's this bottle right here we go
so I did the bad hand makeup challenge
where I used only my left hand I still
like that video down below you missed it
I'm just gonna tend not to get this all
in my hair I'm gonna need a little more
not sure when this video is gonna be
going up yet but I am gonna have a
shadow and schmooze coming I'm just
literally pre-filming out the wazoo
right now I've been filming like two or
three videos a day to get like three or
four weeks of videos done between
traveling and the move and everything so
I think once I am moved that's what I'm
gonna do the shadow is it my nose it's
good thing that was good
get that tip my upper lip feels like
there's a lot of foundation on it
maybe I'm just dry okay I'm gonna like
cover my hairline here okay I don't feel
like this is blended at all get the mask
in I'm use my usual combo which has been
these two lately
whoo oh this feels way weirder than the
foundation try not to poke your eyeball
out it's always a good time this one I
just usually put a DAB just to get it a
little bit lighter you guys saw this
room right now it's a joke there's like
piles of moving boxes makeup everywhere
things to get rid of everywhere random
plants blending this out feels a lot
easier to do then when I was putting it
on with that applicator --why is my
upper lip feels like there's so much
foundation on it
I always just mix these two I kind of
put on the first shade that I mix first
and then match it so it's gonna be
interesting and try and get the same
shade since I mix these two powders okay
okay this doesn't feel too weird this
one might be too white we'll see but we
I mean you not gonna set my forehead
especially with this foundation I
usually don't use the news you a bronzer
can't look at the mirror not looking at
the mirror I'm gonna go in with actually
the darker shade okay
it feels like it's in the race but maybe
gonna try and blend this out with this
brush okay now I'm going to use my Sigma
15 and will not out add a little bit
more
I'm uses a Oh a studio radiant liudmila
in the shade frantic pink there's no
mirror in this guy I can't remember how
she Marie this is this might be a bad
idea put it right on the apples
okay caramel apple actually sounds
bottom right now okay good I'm gonna
take my powder brush by the way the link
for this brush has been broken I don't
know if they I think they're just
redoing their whole site for this I
don't know but for a while now so I
don't know what's happening with that
but you can find this brush it's bomb
this is the fertile se before I'm gonna
go with cream puffs the AOA highlighter
both these are a dollar from shop miss a
again there's no near on this one either
also can't really remember I should
probably be doing this with products I
know how they perform so I know how much
to put on but living on the edge a
little bit more just in case I think the
eyes are gonna be the real hard part
it's good little nose I'm gonna find my
nose for a second I feel like I'm
putting this on not my nose right now
doesn't feel like it's all my buddy my
upper lip feels so funky right now what
is happening with my upper lip all right
 do we have to do a brows now first
we run do a little spooley action I can
find my brow hairs there's a couple it
feels kind of cool I feel like I'm
raking one of those sand gardens a brow
gel would probably be the safer option
here but this is what I usually use so
I'm gonna try it this is the Maybelline
tattoo studio how do I not get my Oh yep
oh where do you feel like I'm off oh I
think I'm way low hold on hold on we
need some more product on here okay that
feels like the right spot
I don't know where to go from here
let's curve this down I felt wrong and
come it up a little bit in the front one
down one to go
well I don't know why that one felt way
easier to find my actual brushers rep
brush hairs briars just like staring
deep into my neighbor's apartment right
now I think the tail is the hardest I
don't know where I'm going down right
now
especially because I don't have as many
hairs out there like right here I can
feel hair so I feel like I'm onto
something there like that one went
pretty well
he's my Mac Paint Pot wanna use the new
Hoodie Beauty rose goal to remaster it
palette haven't tried this yet there's a
huge-ass mirror though so I can't bend
this thing back I'm gonna cover the
mirror I have not seen anything alright
have a concoction here I have a Sephora
bag over the pellet so I cannot see the
mirror I'm gonna start out with the
shade sandalwood put that into the
crease do some good old windshield
wipers get it in there
we're gonna do false lashes ooh
gonna be rough oh it's kind of just
easier to close your eyes I'm gonna go
with this shade henna find my outer-v
here I almost feel like it's harder if
you try and like follow where your hand
is I think it's right here yeah build
that up a little bit in case I'm gonna
go back in and blend that out in a
second with the other brush for some
reason I feel like I need like
sunglasses right now
definitely no scent out but my eyes are
like I'm kidding hello strained I'm
basically just feeling where my eye
socket is right there and trying to like
semi do a v-shape okay now I'm gonna go
in and blend I think I want to use this
rose gold shade or trust fund or Dubai
Dubai looks really pretty
whew that looks pretty it's like a
duochrome kind of thing try and press
this on my eyelid there it is and like
pulling that into the Browns maybe
I'm gonna go back in with whatever is
left over on this brush and just add
that brown a little bit back in yep just
to make sure I didn't cover it up let's
go back in with the face highlight and
put this on the inner corner where's
that there she is
up and down so I'm gonna go in with my
waterline eyeliner this could be
disastrous oh there it is oh that didn't
feel right there we go there we go we're
on it
you missed the inner part of this one
maybe I need the angle it a different
angle here might blend some of this pink
man-eater it's like a deeper magenta
kind of shade down here hopefully it
doesn't make me look like I had pink I
was trying directly into the lights
maybe that's my problem
right so what I feel like I would
usually do is go in with my flat edge
brush and take the black in here since I
did a black waterline and just like
press this under my lashes wherever
those are there they are
Wow this takes so much concentration
right now this is a hard spot to find
there we go there we go did I did my
brush back-end do I have eye shadow on
this right now I don't even go and blend
that again okay I think we're good on
the eye shadow feel like I have half of
that in my eyeball right now my eyeliner
with my eyes open lately has been pretty
hit or miss so this is gonna be real
interesting um-hmm I'm gonna start with
my eyes closed maybe oh there we are
there we are all right I'm gonna start
to go in for the wing folks
well I should not have looked it up but
no idea where I left off well this feels
way too high uh I don't know what just
happened let's hope for the best for
this I okay
winging it winging it connecting that
one also felt a little bit out there
trying to fill it in I have about 1%
confidence and how that wing just turned
out I think it went farther in on that
one so I'm gonna bring this one I'm
gonna do a thin coat of mascara before
we try and put on false lashes why why
am I doing this gonna look down I'm
gonna try and use these AOA Scarlett
lashes these ones look a little bit more
natural wispy they kind of look like
ardell demi wispies and I found my glue
but where did I just put it with this
guy up look pretty small so I don't
think I'm gonna need to trim these at
all oh I forgot setting spray okay I'm
gonna go in with my Too Faced again just
overtop get this a nice glow that is the
one thing that I'm used to doing with my
eyes closed this is slightly terrifying
here we go going in for the landing what
the heck I can't even feel it
maybe I should have chose a heavier pair
so I could actually feel the band cuz I
literally can't feel anything right now
oh this feels hella far in kid dragging
it out I literally can't feel the band
on these heels a little bit weird and up
here I don't know what's happening right
here
I feel lashes that's a good sign hardest
part is just getting it to land on your
frigging eye I don't know where my hand
is in relation to my eye right now oh
we've landed
baggage claim number five that one I
might be a little too far out here let
me drag this one in who the others glue
is pretty dry already right bottom
mascara this this could be scary or on
him or on him
I think or just am on air I think we
just have lipstick left I'm gonna go
with this NARS liquid lipstick this is
in the shade American woman there's not
a whole lot of room for error here
this applicator is really stiff though
so I think it'll be may be easier to get
like the line oh I just ate some I think
would not recommend eating that I don't
know if I have any product on here but
that line felt promising all right top
lip is where we could potentially go
downhill I don't know if this lipstick
option was a good idea is when the
formula is almost like so lightweight
and dry that I can't tell if I'm getting
anything on here I think it's all filled
in okay I don't do everything setting
spray lashes this one I can tell is not
doing so hot I think we're good and I
look I'm a little terrified I'm gonna
use the palette that I have uncovered
here we go the reveal oh that was not
that bad I'm like kind of shocked whoa
whoa this is probably the most highlight
you've ever seen me on that lipstick
what the heck that was not terrible
totally shocked by this eyeliner I
haven't been doing eyeliner that good
with my eyes open lately
okay this eyeliner we went a little
downhill get closer for you guys I guess
I can take this off the monitor now but
this I I would wear this I outside I
think the brows um yeah the brows not my
not my best not my best bro this lash
felt like it was like out to here
overall I'm quite shocked right now
I think that went about 50 billion times
better than I was picturing in my head
this eyeliner literally felt so wrong I
have no idea how I actually ended up
semi-decent maybe I should do eyeliner
with my
clothes more often but let me know what
you guys think how it went down below
