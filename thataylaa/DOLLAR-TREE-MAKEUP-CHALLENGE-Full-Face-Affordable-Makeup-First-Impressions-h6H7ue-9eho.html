so today we're going to be doing the
dollar tree makeup challenge just
basically where you take a trip to
Dollar Tree load up on this much makeup
as you can find and then attempt to put
on your face here's a hot mess right now
I'm a hot mess right now I actually
filmed this entire video intro
everything earlier today and I just went
back to edit it and I was missing like
the first half so we're going to do this
again and mainly lost footage of my face
products and stuff so at least all the
eye makeup was there most of it was
there but let's do this so as far as
foundation I obviously don't have the
original packaging anymore because I was
from when I first opened it so I have
the sassy &amp;amp; chic makeup foundation this
is in the lightest shade anasazi achieve
BB cream so one looked a little bit dark
so I decided to pick up both and I'm
just gonna mix the two I couldn't find
any kind of foundation brush at Dollar
Tree so I'm just going to be applying
foundation with my fingers I think like
freshman year college or something I
would only apply it on Asia with my
hands so I don't mind doing that now
this BB cream is actually super pale so
if you're as light as I am I'll just
show you guys by itself like this is
pretty pale this is the BB cream alone
I'm going to mix in the two just to get
a little bit more coverage because this
is pretty sheer but just so you can see
like this is a duller pale product so
I'm gonna go ahead and mix these two
face products when I was shopping for
all these we're definitely most
challenging for me just because they
didn't have any concealer at all and
they also didn't have any whoops got way
too much face powders that match my skin
tone so I couldn't find a setting powder
and I also can't find concealer so we're
just going to try and load this up
especially under the eyes since they
don't have concealer I feel like this
challenge is extra challenging for me
because I usually have to cover up
I definitely will be mixing that BB
cream in with other stuff because I love
how light it is but these are extremely
dewy like almost oily doing my hair is
also different between this clip in the
next clip because nicely added some
darker words to my hair maybe something
about doing the drugs
or makeup under $20 kind of video let me
know if you guys would want to see that
okay so now I'm just going to go back in
and kind of stipple on some areas to get
a little bit more coverage hopefully so
now that I have that second layer on
definitely still on more like the light
coverage and you can still see all of my
acne and stuff coming through and I
couldn't find a setting powder like I
said so we're just going to go straight
in with bronzer / contour and I ended up
picking up this powder this is the LA
Colors powder in the shade beige now
this supposed to be like an all-over
face powder I couldn't find a match
contour shade or any kind of matte
bronzer there so I decided to just pick
up a powder a few shades too dark and
use that as a contour and this brush I
really like this is the wet and wild
brush this I got from Dollar Tree I just
already tried it out and shade wise in
the powder I think I actually could have
gone a shade up but I am getting a
really nice super natural kind of
contour this brush I am feeling it's
like super soft since I don't have any
concealer I'm just going to go back in
with that BB cream since this is pretty
light I'm just going to apply a tiny bit
this under my eyes so I found this LA
Colors blush in pink blush super
original name I really like these kind
of purpley pink shades so we're gonna
try this one out alright so I think
that's why I cut off the next clip you
see will be the original footage even
know why they waste their two cents
putting this in you should never try to
put blush on with this please don't I'm
going to keep this out because we might
be able to use it in the crease so this
is a blush looks like what's really
pretty okay feel like that gave a nice
natural kind of pink cheek not super
intense blending out easily especially
for not having any kind of powder
underneath and I like the shade it's a
very subtle pinky purple shade whoo we
are looking dewy so for a highlight I
got this which I'm hoping will work this
is the LA color shimmering eyeshadow
it's actually a loose eyeshadow in the
snow white I typically like using
eyeshadows as highlights anyways and
especially when I straight up white okay
this is looking pretty glittery I don't
know if you guys will be able to see
that but it's pretty much straight up
glitter so I'm going to actually try one
of the shades from one of the eyeshadow
palettes I got this is my backup plan
this white right here this is the LA
colored Lily soul hope but this one will
work who actually feels pretty soft oh
this will totally work alright let's do
this I'm excited so I'm actually going
to take this large eye shadow brush from
Wet n Wild if you really didn't have
brushes you probably could use this and
just like blend it out with your finger
but since they had this brush there I'm
going to use that okay not bad at all
the rest of my face was on right now I'm
kind of feeling this I'm gonna use my
finger a little bit just to blend it out
this brush though not the best to apply
it but that's okay we got our fingers
this actually looks very nice not that
we need any more glue right now but I
feel like life is not complete if I
don't highlight my nose they didn't have
any brow products there luckily I have
permanent eyebrows on right now not
right now for as long as they're
permanent so I'm just going to skip over
brows if you did need to do your brows
you try and find a matte brown shade in
one of the eyeshadow palettes and
totally just use that for your brows so
to start off with the eyes I'm just
going to go back in with this face
powder that we use and use this wet and
wild brush and I'm just going to blend
this straight into the crease since this
is just a little bit darker this will be
a nice transition shade hopefully this
brush is super soft I'm really liking
the wet and wild version so far you know
what I'm just gonna use this game with a
super crappy foam thing which I don't
know if that was supposed to be a sponge
or not but I'm going to use this as a
sponge and just even get a little more
coverage okay that's totally working
let's keep going probably gonna regret
this at some point I'm gonna keep the
forehead I think I'm gonna leave my
forehead I just don't want it to look
too all over the place
I have a few different I shadow palettes
that I picked up I have one with like
more funky colors this blue was like
kind of speaking to me and this one has
a bunch of neutrals then we have the one
I used as a highlighter this one I got
mostly for the white shade and the black
because I think we can do
a cool kind of I with this buy all of
the packaging on this one you would
think I was trying to steal a like $50 I
shadow palette I don't know where I'm
going to start I kind of just want to
put stuff on my eyes so these are a
little chalky I think I like this green
shade from this palette
let's do I'm going to start by using
this coppery shade right here and I'm
just going to place this on the outer
edge and I'm just using the sponge that
comes with because I don't have any kind
of small brushes to work with
okay just kidding we're putting this all
over the lid
apparently I think I'm just going to use
my finger for the edges the sponge I
feel like is best to kind of blend it
but if you actually want to get product
on your eyes you're going to need to use
your finger next I'm going to take this
black shade right here time to create a
smokey eye we'll see how it goes we're
going to use that same sponge just the
other end the black actually has more
color than I was expecting
so now that we have the color packed on
right there I'm going to flip over the
sponge just blend that into the brown
shade a little bit
now I'm going to go back in with the
brush and the face powder and just kind
of blend out the edges we can oh man
this black is like on there
okay well that's interesting this side
is kind of just blending away I'm
getting some major black fallout we're
just gonna have to take that off and
then go back in with my Oso great
concealer oh it's actually a good method
alright we're gonna clean up the edges
you know what let's get tape tape tape
at Dollar Tree alright sweet so this
will just create a sharper edge which
will hopefully make this look look a
little more put together these don't
have a whole lot of payoff but his green
gold one
does look doable I'm just going to put
this on the center of my eye using my
finger that's nice
and I'm just using my finger to blend
that into the black a little bit I'm
going to take a mix of the white shade
and this kind of beige shade right here
looks a little muddy but it'll do and
take the white on my sponge the only
thing I think we're really missing is
like a good transition color I'm really
debating using this lipstick that I have
I want to do it this could be a total
disaster this is like getting very
inventive
okay that is totally helping heck yeah
taking away all the lid shade but it is
blending
let's take off the tape see what we're
working with so I'm going back with a BB
cream just to cover up what we took off
I'm setting just a little bit with this
powder
it's definitely darkening it so I think
I'm going to keep that in our corner LA
Colors liquid eyeliner we're going to
attempt to wing it out these are goes oh
it's actually a super fine tip
so far so good got the bass on when they
need two hands for this
the Alamo was pretty good I think the
brush tip is definitely not something
that's easy to work with it's pretty
flimsy so you'd really have to take your
time trying to get that wing it's nice
and black went over the shimmer fine
well I'm waiting for the liner to dry a
little bit I'm gonna go back in with the
white shadow and just fix the highlight
since I feel like we lost a lot of it
I'm going to go in with this LA Colors
auto liners like retractable eyeliner
hopefully this goes on on the waterline
the answer is no I'm going to drag it a
tiny bit down to the bottom lashlines if
you just keep coding it like five
thousand times you do get some eyeliner
I'm going to take the sponge again and
go back in with the lipstick shade and
just blend a little bit under that black
this lipstick is like saving my life
this probably has like five thousand bad
ingredients that you're not supposed to
put on your eyes but yellow I'm adding a
tiny bit of that green gold shade tiny
bit more of the white right to the inner
corner all right mascara this is the LA
Colors mascara and I am going to be
putting on false lashes that I got there
so I'm just going to do a super thin
coat of mascara and then apply these to
the bottom lashes this one was
definitely more on the dry side it's
also probably just been sitting on a
Dollar Tree shelf for eight years
someone do falsies first and then go in
for bottom lashes these are the wet and
wild shredding the fringe I believe I've
tried these before if I'm remembering
correctly yeah they're cut so they're
basically all even so I'm actually going
to go in and trim some of these just to
make them look a little bit more natural
so you can do this to any pair of false
lashes that you have I'm just going to
go and kind of randomly snip some of the
pieces so they're not all totally even
it's kind of like layering your hair you
know I'm using their lashley Dollar Tree
didn't have any separate lash glue so
we're just going to use the one that
this comes with also I'm trying not to
put heat on my hair right now since it's
super damaged so hence the hairstyle
today this lash wants to do everything
except stick to my eyeball right now all
right we're just gonna have to move on
because this eyelash is like doing its
own thing right now
I bought this lipstick which I even say
what this is the LA color is natural
shine this is what we used in the crease
on the eyes too and then I also have
this bomb tint by elf and nude ooh I
like this color smells good feels really
nice on the lips and moisturizing yeah
film the lipstick I'm still going to
open the elf natural nude just to see if
it's a little bit lighter so I can tap
it on the center well this actually
looks way darker dang it probably could
use this as a contour I'm going to go
back in with the eye shadow palette and
take this light pink shimmery shade and
just put that
on the center and I just finished this
outro and you can do whatever you want
alright so this is the final dollar tree
look out of all the products that I
tried
I think the brushes are worth it I do
like the blush it's very very subtle and
you have to put quite a bit on but I
like this blush shade eyeshadows I would
definitely pass on both of these this I
really had to layer up to get color
payoff I do like this white shade as a
highlight though looks pretty good
for me this foundation is a pass just
because it doesn't give as much coverage
as I usually like and it does look
extremely dewy almost to the Gracy point
dewy this one I'm kind of excited about
mixing with other stuff though because
this was super light which is hard to
find anywhere if you guys liked this
