makeup drugstore random all are
kind of loving it today woke up wasn't
feeling too well so this is what's
happening can't tell if I'm in focus or
not hopefully I am so I went to bartels
Walgreens got some stuff from an
influencer box that I want to share with
you guys let's do it so the first thing
I picked up is the crest 3d white
Whitestrips I used to use like actual
teeth whitening things from the dentist
like trays
I lost my knee to whiten these babies up
you know I'm saying
I drink ridiculous amounts of coffee and
wine I wanted to get something just to
remove the coffee stains just make my
teeth look white again these were on
sale for $24 and they're usually like 35
or 40 so I figured now it'd be a good
time to pick them up while we're on the
teeth-whitening thing I just got my
crest 3d white radiant mint toothpaste I
always use this nothing new if you watch
my empties videos I mentioned this
before I just think this stuff works
really well and it's toothpaste like I
mentioned I was feeling pretty shitty
this morning I do get chronic migraines
which I don't think I've ever mentioned
before just because there hasn't really
been a need to but I do get deep tissue
massages for my neck I've like major
neck issues and the lady recommended
that I get epsom salt so I picked up a
bag of the dr. teals Epsom salt this
just has eucalyptus spearmint they had a
lavender one and that's one sheeny
suggest I get for like relaxing your
muscles but they were out of it so I
just picked up this one I need to try
and dedicate an hour a day just like to
myself taking a bath
chilling in some Epsom salt and relaxing
and like not thinking about anything
I feel like between my two jobs there's
not really a moment where I'm not
thinking about either work or YouTube
and I need to change that I have unreal
amounts of stress right now alright so
then I have some hair dye this is just
the Revlon color silk diet is this black
yeah this is just in ten black I usually
switch between this stuff and Garnier
I don't want to spend ten dollars for a
hair dye $3 Revlon option bottle of
color silk then I picked up some green
tea and cucumber wipe so these are just
like baby wipes that I keep up on my
makeup station I think so you see use to
take off the makeup from the back of my
hand when I do my foundation and just to
like wipe down my makeup area and just
keep things clean it has covered a whole
box of clearance at bartels and
everything was like $1 to $3 obviously
couldn't resist that I picked up two the
covergirl outlast stay all day liquid
lipsticks I have one of these that I
mentioned before it's like my all-time
favorite red color the link down below
cuz I can't remember the name but I just
got nude and wine to five nude is a
really great color if you literally want
to look like you just have like a little
bit of color to your natural lips why to
five I have not tried yet but it looks
like a nice muted red and you guys know
I'm all about the muted reds these are
both $2.99 which is crazy because they
usually retail for like nine to ten
dollars I think these are just really
awesome long lasting lipsticks if you're
someone that doesn't like to mess with
your lipstick you just like to put it on
and you're good to go and I definitely
check this out Physicians Formula was
40% off so obviously I had to pick up my
favorites
got another one of the physician's
formula of mineral we're refracting
powder
I like how I say this in pretty much
every video and I still don't know the
name by heart if you're new to my
channel this is what I set my under eye
concealer with it's light enough for my
skin and it's amazing and I love it
again another one of my Holy Grail
products this is the Physicians Formula
eye booster this is in the shade ultra
black make sure you get ultra black not
just black this one's amazeballs
it's a liquid eyeliner pen this is what
I use every day to make my wing it's not
felt if it has like a brush tip to it
which is why I really like
it lasts forever you need it then I
picked up these eye makeup remover pads
I've never tried these I thought I would
give these a go since they are 40% off I
think they were like 250 or $3 or
something and there's 60 pads in here
that's pretty good it says it's
hypoallergenic and fragrance free these
are also oil-free I don't do not oil
free makeup remover on my eyes that's a
really weird way to say that sentence I
don't like putting oil on my eyes I
think it feels weird and it bothers me
then I just got some toenail clippers
nothing exciting here I just lost mine
then I found the wet and wild sunset
stripped I think I actually got this at
Walgreens this was the Wet n Wild sunset
stripped it's a gold lipstick I haven't
opened this yet this is limited edition
let's just open it it's a gold lipstick
and you can't say no to bold lipsticks
am i right all right let's see this
thing maybe you should say no to gold
lipsticks from the drugstore yeah
there's not really too much color to it
you can kind of see it this might be
like it go on top of another lipstick
kind of lipstick nice start two items
which I thought I might Phil mentioned
because they're like beauty related I
got these a few weeks ago the first is
the glam glow mask this is the youth mud
tingle exfoliate exfoliate exfoliate Wow
treatment what is this a very sexy on a
mud mask anyways I got this off of
fragrance net because it was like 25 or
30 dollars instead of 60 it was like
insanely markdown I'll leave the link
down below if you guys want to check it
out I also have a 15% off coupon code if
you're interested I'm pretty sure if
you've ever watched a YouTube video in
your life you've heard of lamb glow it's
basically just a really expensive mud
mask I've used it a few times I don't
think it's like revolutionary yet I'm
going to continue to use it we'll see
what I think about it so far I really
don't understand what is so different
about this than any other run mask I
don't know I feel like I'm missing some
so I got the Burberry Brit perfume if
you saw my month it's a October race and
rejects video I mentioned this in there
I also got this from fragrance net this
is like my favorite perfume right now it
smells kind of like older woman but I
really like it then I've got some random
items that I got in a influenster voxbox
or whatever they're called you can take
serving surveys and qualify for certain
boxes and then they send you a box with
some free stuff I'm just going to show
you like the makeup related stuff
because there were some really random
 in there but the first thing is the
Rimmel scandaleyes rockin is a sim focus
rock'n curves mascara looks like a very
interesting brush I don't know if you
guys can see that on the packaging but
it's curved and very interesting shapes
not really sure how you're supposed to
like put that on your eyeball but I
guess we'll find out then they included
a Rimmel Moisture renew eyeliner and
this is white you always use a good
white eyeliner for the waterline and
this does look like it's roll-up and
retractable so I really like that so
don't have to sharpen it then they threw
in some Jerkins extra healing
moisturizer I've never tried the
dragon's moisturizer it smells like
babies then they threw in the lipstick
this is the Rimmel lipstick in five zero
five red alert looks like a nice bright
cherry red color
well almost go at it on the nose close
call this is kind of interesting this is
a new flare all hair food is a hair mask
with honey apricot not sure how I feel
about the honey
apricot thing that's going on but it
says it's paraben free mineral oil free
and it's just like a hair mask that's
supposed to wrap your hair and luscious
moisture and radiant shine they give you
a $3 off coupon if you buy this at
Target oh it actually smells really good
I don't think that smells like apricot
or honey at all it smells kind of
coconutty okay I would definitely try
this out now this kind of makes me want
to go wash my hair right now so that's
everything that I've been hoarding in
the corner of my room makeup wise for
the last couple weeks let me know down
below if you guys want to see a winter
clothing haul because I also have a pile
of clothes that I'm debating pulling or
not if you like this video and you want
more holes be sure to give it a thumbs

pre recorded a few videos but my time
