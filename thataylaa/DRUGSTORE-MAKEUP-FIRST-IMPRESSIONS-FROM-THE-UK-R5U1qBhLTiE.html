to Seattle was that I'm excited for
avvocato Jost
all right so today we have a very
exciting video if you don't know I was
just in London I documented everything
on snapchat and I have a whole vlog
actually showing my experience in London
with Burberry which was unreal
still feel like I need to pinch myself
that it actually happened I literally
just landed back in Seattle from London
last night it was like 4:00 a.m. London
time so I am hundred and twenty percent
jet-lagged right now don't know what day
it is don't know what time it is just
live in life and playing with makeup but
when I was in London I obviously had to
scope out the drugstores so I went to
boots and Superdrug actually found 99%
of the stuff at Superdrug I went to the
one on Oxford Street which was huge it
was pretty picked through so there were
some stuff that I wanted to get that was
just out of stock at the moment but it
still did pretty good so here's my super
drug bag this is just the first
impression style video I'm going to be
wearing this throughout the day so you
guys can see how it holds up if you're
excited for this video make sure you
give it a thumbs up so I know if you're
new here you can join the BAE reto
family and subscribe I upload Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. 5th time if you
want to see how I got this looks you're
in the right place just keep watching it
feels so good to be sitting down and
filming today I am stoked I should get a
hair clip it's literally the morning
after I got back from London
I am majorly jet-lagged right now but
I'm actually like I'm on a high right
now I think I'm gonna like hit a wall
soon and totally crashed I think I
mostly have energy because oh my goes
one we are trying out a ton of
makeup that I bought in London my lips
are actually super trap right now so I'm
going to try out this Carmex lip balm I
love Carmack's is what I use every
single night but they had this leopard
one there I've never seen this in the
States this is the same exact formula as
usual it's just leopard which makes it
20 times more exciting nothing like a
new lip balm to begin to have an insta
cart grocery delivery coming right now
so we're probably going to have to pause
in a second it's always nice when you
have a little bit of a break and then
can come back like re-energize and
that's how I feel right now so I picked
up two different primers one of them is
more of a serum but it says that you can
use this as a primer this is the soap &amp;amp;
Glory fab core three in one oil
controlling serum smooth shine free
complexion use on its own before your
moisturizer or under makeup as a primer
I kind of want to try this one but I
also got the maybelline superstay makeup
extending prime
I love Maybelline face products for the
most part so this won't seem promising
to me but I think wanted to ads us on
today so we have soap &amp;amp; Glory in
Walgreens now in the US but the
selection in London doesn't even compare
we have like a tiny ass little wall and
Walgreens at least one in Seattle and in
London they had two giant huge you know
like the long display things two giant
ones of those so I just had a ton more
products that comes in as little squeeze
tube things probably could just put this
on the center of your face but it
actually has more of like a lotion kind
of consistency smells a little bit
medicinal which I like and it dries down
very fast ooh I like this finish yeah
it's drying into almost like a powder
finish look how red my face just got my
skin by the way right now it's not
loving life I am breaking out all over
the place in my hairline down my chin so
I got two different foundations here to
try not sure if I'm going to do a
foundation Friday on one of these but I
have the collection cosmetics naturally
matte foundation and then the berry and
flawless matte finish oil-free
foundation I'm feeling this one today I
don't know why it's just kind of calling
my name
so I've never tried anything from Barry
M I got this foundation and also a
setting spray that we're going to be
using later and actually I got a few
other things from Barry M - I tweeted
you guys asking the best brands to try
out and products to get so some of this
stuff is from your recommendations as it
contains soothing moisturizers with skin
healing properties for a flawless matte
finish I have the lightest shade I'm
gonna try it with the Sigma f80 first on
this side of my face and then I'll
probably use a sponge on the other side
here you need to chill whew well okay
this is better coverage when I was
expecting and it feels very moisturizing
going on right now it doesn't have a
super matte finish looks more like a
satin matte but the finish looks really
nice I can't really see anything on my
face
I think the shade works it might be a
little bit dark it always looks
different on camera so I'm use my peer
cosmetics sponge on the other side of my
face so see if there's a difference I
would say with the sponge and a brush is
looking like high medium coverage I am
gonna do a wear test in this video keep
everything
on for not my soul ten hours but as long
as I can tonight I'm going out to a
dinner thing so I might have to take off
all my makeup and redo it because I kind
of want to do like an intense smoky eye
today so we're just going to play it by
ear but I do want to do some kind of
wear test so you can see what is this
reminding me of all most of the Make Up
For Ever Ultra HD foundation it has that
really light kind of feel to it the
shave looks a bit too yellow for my
skintone I'm going to see if this is
buildable just use a tiny bit go over
some of my acne I'm actually not getting
a whole lot more coverage in terms of
sundrian not going to take here anything
but I don't think I'm getting a whole
lot more coverage so I wouldn't say that
this one is buildable in the sense that
you're going to get more coverage if you
build it up yeah definitely not so I'm
just going to go in with concealer to
kind of spot conceal on those areas but
this looks very nice one of my all-time
favorite concealers is the collection
cosmetics lasting perfection concealer
in the lightest shade I've talked about
this for feel like at least a year now
maybe even a couple years before I got
on the Tarte shaped aid bandwagon this
was my like go-to concealer since this
is a UK brand I stocked up I got three
of these it's only a few pounds there
and I usually have to order it on eBay
in the US so I topped up on this stuff
because I love it it's light enough for
me it has really good coverage it's
moisturizing doesn't cake up or anything
blending this out with my usual
concealer brush the morphe 238 I'm
pretty sure my London vlog is going up
before this video so you guys will have
already seen some of the trip but
superdrug was unreal I was like in
heaven I'm gonna spread this concealer
down the center of my face and then also
use it to spot conceal on acne that's
the foundation in cover-up this
concealer doesn't set super fast so you
do have some time to work with it so
don't really get any kind of powder for
my under eyes so I'm just going to use
my normal stargazer pressed powder
so even brands that we have in the u.s.
like Revlon and Maybelline they carry
different kinds of products in other
countries sometimes is the same products
but they have different packaging but
I've never seen this powder in the US
this is the matte maker mattifying
powder in the lightest shade which is
classic ivory 10 this looked super light
which is what kind of Drew me
to us how does this open what's
happening here I don't know if my brain
is just not functioning right now I
cannot get this open now I'm actually
starting to get pissed what the heck
my hand is cramping I'm gonna turn this
off and literally go attempt to open
this with like a tool hallelujah I don't
even know how I got this open I was
literally digging to get some kind of
power tool to open this thing starting
to think I might just be delusional
right now and it does lose light hell
yeah it's definitely helping to lighten
it which is very exciting that this is
actually a light drugstore powder
curious to see how this holds up
throughout the day since I have a
mattifying primer and powder on right
now scared to put this lid back on so
let's do brows I didn't get any new brow
products so I'm just going to do my
normal brow routine lately using the
benefit precisely my brow pencil with
the Ulta brow gel I'm going to do this
off camera and then I'll be right back
if you want to see how I do this on
camera I showed it in my everyday makeup
routine video that just went up so I'll
put that in a little eye over here if
you missed that alright we've got the
brows on I didn't get any kind of eye
primer but I did pull my concealer up on
top of my lid so I think we should be
good oh wait don't do eyes first or face
let's finish off the face I have a few
different actually have a ton of face
products I want to try like contour and
bronzers and everything I got this Barry
M feelin cheeky sculpting palette it
looks like there's a contour brighten
that is not a brightening color for my
skin tone and then highlight over here
this is the Barry M illuminating
highlighter palette I'm definitely going
to be going in with this white shade
this is why I picked this up so I think
as a bronzer / contour I might route
this mu a bronze perfection matte this
thing is freaking huge this is like the
size of my face there just got a lot
doesn't look to oranjee I did get a lot
but it's blending out really really
easily an mu a brand you can get at CVS
now but again they had way more products
at Superdrug than what we have blush I
have two different options I got the Max
Factor cream puff blush intense nude
mauve this looks like a really nice
neutral color and that one looks like it
has kind of a sheen to it and I also
picked up the Rimmel santa Rose blush I
don't think we have this in the u.s. ooh
this looks pretty so this is more of
like a rose
um ah kind of color this one looks a bit
more peachy I think I'm going to go in
with this Max Factor one we're going to
do the blush really quick and then into
cars ooh oh hell yeah
very pretty almost has like a pink kind
of reflect to it blending out really
nicely ooh I like that
paws gonna get groceries okay we're good
on groceries I looked in the bathroom
mirror and yeah the foundation is
definitely a shade or two too dark don't
know why it will always look so
different in here like I said I want to
try this highlighting palette pretty but
I do feel like it's emphasizing some of
the texture yeah I can definitely see
all of my pores right now for eye primer
I'm just going to use my Revlon
Colorstay cream shadow and 7:15 I feel
like I could go without eyeprimer right
now because I pulled my concealer up but
why not the for my crease I'm actually
going to go in with the shade right here
from that feelin cheeky palette looks
like a warm kind of brown shade I can't
get over the finish of my face right now
for the amount of texture and acne I
have on my skin right now it looks
extremely smooth by the way let's look
at the time since I'm doing a check-in
and my whole face makeup is done it's
10:47 right now so I had like five
different eye shadow products and
palettes in my basket and then I
eliminated it down to one just cuz I
feel like I have so much eye shadow but
this is the MUA professional six shade
palette in rustic rested rested wonders
the cool thing about superdrug is that
they have testers out why doesn't our
drugstore do that I feel like you could
totally cut down on the whole returning
drugstore makeup thing in the u.s. if
you just had testers out go figure
you can actually swatch the shades so
when I was watching these they felt
super nice and pigmented I almost want
to do like a red smokey eye
why is my camera flashing right now I
start off by taking this shade I'm just
use my finger so this shade is pretty
but it's a little bit tricky to blend
like it's not really spreading just kind
of sticking to wherever I put it down
before I go in with more of the shades
from this thing I'm going to blend some
matte shades into the crease to kind of
smoke it out I didn't get any matte
eyeshadows so I'm just going to go in
with my pixie palette this is it
time pixee palette and the matte shades
in here are beautiful I've been really
liking this thing so I'm going to take
this shade right here and just kind of
blend this into the crease I'm pulling
this kind of far in because I think I
want to do more of a halo I'm going to
take this light pink shade right here
and put that right on the center ok
that's exciting and that crazy the thing
that some people don't get joy for my
eye shadow at all I mean this is like
making my day right now
I want a bit more depth in the outer
corners so I'm going with the darkest
brown shade right here I'm just blending
this in my outer V and then bringing it
inwards a little bit there was a
standalone pixie store on cannibal over
the called camber Street Canterbury it
was closed and I walked past it but when
I go back to London definitely want to
hit that up just to make sure that pop
is still going strong I'm just putting a
little bit more of that right on the
center that pink shade so I'm going to
blend some of those shadows on my lower
lash line but first I'm going to go in
with some liquid liner for my waterline
this is the Catrice liquid metal gel eye
pencil this I've been really liking for
my waterline it's what I wore when I was
in London it stays on and it doesn't
burn my eyes which is difficult to find
patrisse you can find that old too now
so to blend out that lower lash line I'm
just going to go back in with that dark
brown shade and just kind of smudge out
the black liner my first thought when I
was coming back to Seattle was that I'm
excited for avocados oast what am i
doing I want to bring some of that red
down below so even though it's more
shimmery it's all good I'm just going to
take that same red shade and blend it
with that brush this is the Sedona lace
904 brush by the way with that right
underneath the black to bring some of
the red down there then take the white
shade and just tell it oh yeah I think I
like how these apply butter with my
finger yes definitely I'm going to go
into my setting spray trying out the
berry M dewy finish mist in fix setting
spray see what kind of spritzer this
house woo oh you're just looking
handsome okay it looks like a nice mist
rather than like a fire hose I feel like
it gave a bit more of a do but not super
overpowering I don't think I want to do
top eyeliner today so I'm going to put
on some mascara and then pop on false
lashes I didn't
any false lashes when I was there but if
you want to stay with the UK drug store
theme you could go in with a lower
lashes I'm going to try out the pure 3d
silk cruelty free lashes these are in
the style bombshell itching your face
with foundation on is the worst all
right I'm gonna put this on then I'll be
right back okay so falsies are on and I
like these so dramatic but they're still
wispy and I don't have any eyeliner on
right now and I feel like it added a lot
of kind of volume to my top lash line
the band is really nice feeling I was
literally thinking when I was putting
these on for once how my eyes didn't
burn and then I straight-up jabbed this
eyeball with mascara so Pro tips don't
try and put on falsies when you don't
know what day it is so this I was super
intrigued by this is a liquid lipstick
by MUA it's the velvet color enhanced
lacquer and this is basically a primer
it says it's a matte lacquer to enhance
lip color apply prior to the lip shade
for increased color intensity so I'm not
sure if this has an actual white color
to it or if it's just more of a lip
primer like a clear lip primer but we're
going to find out okay so it looks
straight of white this is exciting this
is white this is crazy so this is kind
of a genius idea if this works because
if you think about it and the same
concept as applying concealer to your
lips to kind of cancel out your natural
lip color and then whatever color that
you put on top pops more it's just like
using white eye primer I don't think I'm
gonna put this right to the outside of
my lips just because I don't want to
have any kind of white on the outside
I'm going to try it with this gosh
liquid lipstick this is one of the
things that you guys tweeted me saying
to try out liquid matte lips in the
shade 0:07 and this has totally dried
down matte since I don't think I'm going
to be using this other lipstick I got
let me swatch it for you and this is by
gosh as well and it's in the shade zero
zero one matte baby lips actually looks
pretty pink I don't think it looks with
that pink in the store smells kind of
chemically okay feels like a gloss going
on super moisturizing really pretty kind
of muted wine color I like wild right
now with his top lip it says liquid
matte lip so this dries down Matt this
is going to be magical because right now
it's looking super glossy and it
literally feels like the most
moisturizing liquid lipstick of our
in my life I'm going to give this a
couple minutes to see if it dries down
because right now it's feeling very
sticky okay so if this one totally dries
down it takes a long-ass time because it
has been about four minutes since I put
this on and it's still not totally dry
down and it feels very sticky so I think
out of everything I tried the only thing
that I was a little bit disappointed by
is the highlighting palette by barium I
think if you like the more kind of
glittery there's just something about
this that totally emphasizes the texture
on my cheeks but if you like that more
intense kind of glittery look you might
like this we'll see how the face
products hold up throughout the day but
off of first impressions I liked how
pretty much all of my face products look
right now just off of first application
my skin looks extremely smooth and kind
of airbrushed right now I like the
Maybelline powder I like that it's light
enough and actually kind of helped to
lighten my face a bit the blush is super
pretty the eyeshadows obviously look
really nice I just think you have to
work with these a bit more than usual
they don't really blend out very easily
so yeah I think out of everything I'm
most excited about the face products I
used and this white liquid lipstick
which I'm definitely going to try out
with normal lipsticks alright I need to
not be functioning in the world right
now literally just tripped over a cord
in a knock down my ring light my mic the
light back there and all my makeup
brushes need to be in bed right now
so it's 405 in the afternoon I have hit
the wall the wall has been hit I am
still going out to dinner but my eyes
are burning so bad right now from the
lash glue that I need to wash off my
face and just redo my makeup really
quick everything's only been on for five
hours but I do want to wrap this up and
do kind of a five hour quick check-in I
figured it's better than no check-in you
can see how it wears after a few hours
so for the amount of mattifying products
I have on my face right now
I feel like I'm actually pretty oily
only five hours in keep in mind that the
lights definitely amplify it because
it's bouncing off my face cuz I was just
napping out in natural lighting and even
there my forehead looks pretty dewy the
thing I like is that my face makeup does
look very nice literally you can almost
see no texture on my skin right now
which is very rare it looks really good
on the center of my face texture wise I
just think I'm a bit oily for only big
on for five hours
I've eaten two meals and this lipstick
is holding up really well hasn't really
come off on the center of my
so it does feel sticky though it doesn't
dry down I feel like it's blood a tiny
bit but nothing bad so I hope you guys
