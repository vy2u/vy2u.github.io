have more energy all right so I have
been running around this first time I'm
sitting down in like three days it feels
like so major hair changes are going
down if you haven't been following me on
snapchat and Instagram and pretty much
any social media you should we are doing
the the journey from black to silver
hair right now which is a process so
basically I feel like all I've been
doing the past three days like dyeing
hair and working so I went shopping so
the hair place that I went to is out in
Bremerton which you have to like take a
ferry to if you're in Seattle so while I
was over there I went into some of their
drugstores because what else would you
do if you have an hour to kill you had a
brandon rite aid and they had a brand
new Walgreens so I got some stuff that
we don't have in the Seattle locations
art drugstores in Seattle are actually
pretty shitty I think because they're
pretty old so into Walgreens Rite Aid
Ulta and then target all the drugstore
stuff was pretty much makeup and then
target is like a ton of random
stuff but I figured I would show you
guys I got some clothes and cleaning
supplies I personally really enjoy
cygwin other people clean with that
might just be me but I'm showing you
guys anyways Before we jump into this
I'm gonna be having a whole video on
like the process and hair and what I'm
going for and all the hair so that
is coming okay so let's just start with
Walgreens I only got a couple things at
Walgreens cuz I found pretty much
everything at Rite Aid that I was
looking for I got the Wet n Wild come
correct
celebrity concealer I heard from someone
I can't remember who this is in the
shade fair but I heard from someone that
this is really nice like full coverage
concealer who was that I don't know so
let's see if this is gonna be light
enough has a little like squeezy tip
applicator and oh just got a bunch of
like oil whoa definitely feels very full
coverage super creamy whoo I'm excited
to use this now and I think the shade
might actually be light enough I think
I'm gonna do okay get ready looking you
a new drugstore stuff or just maybe this
stuff that I call let me know if you
guys want to see that I am a giant
sucker for free
and Mitchum completely rebranded and
came out with this whole new packaging
basically and I just think it's super
pretty with like the mint and light pink
because one is the clinical gel with no
white marks it's a clear gel I have such
a hard time finding deodorants I don't
stain on my clothes white like literally
after I wash them they'll stay in the
armpits white let's do this feel like I
found some unique things that I haven't
really seen before
so Rite Aid had basically a dupe for the
Beauty Blender and the Real Techniques
sponge which is awesome both of these
were $4.99 and I think they had buy one
get one half off so super curious to see
I can't say the word curious curious
really interested to see how these
compare to the actual video blender and
Real Techniques sponge I'm a big fan of
the Real Techniques sponge over the
Beauty Blender and I think it's a lot
better and cheaper I love wet and wild a
shadows I think they're some of the best
eyeshadows from the drugstore and I
haven't tried their whole palettes yet
so I got both of them there's like a
more neutral one and then a purpley dark
tone one this one looks like there's
some super pretty bold champagne tones
in here and then this this looks nice
too so we might be doing a look with
this who knows got a couple lashes I've
never seen before I'm pretty sure this
is the Julie G brron but it was sitting
was Jessie girl
so not really sure what was going on
there but oh yes it's totally Julie G so
here's Julie G she's a youtuber she made
the hole at nail polish line that I love
they carry it at rite-aid if you never
tried it it's pretty good and I guess
she came up with false lashes I don't
know if this has been out for a while or
what but she has her own lashes now
these ones look super nice and separated
this is 108 and then these are more
wispy and dramatic this is 101 and I
guess it comes with like a free lash
curler the band looks nice and thin
looks kind of like the Ardell band then
I also picked up some Revlon lash glue
because I haven't tried this yet it is
pretty much the last lash glue on planet
earth that I haven't tried I have such a
bizarre thing with lash glue even
latex-free lash glue majorly irritates
my eyes that can only leave false lashes
on for a couple of hours the house of
lashes lash glue of follow me on
snapchat
you saw my fun experience with that well
slide it off my pants it says that it's
latex-free mess-free dries clear it's
the last thing I got at Rite Aid is this
LA Colors matte palette 5 shades this is
in the shade natural linen it's kind of
hard to find cool toned eyeshadows from
the drugstore so I thought this would be
nice oh he's so soft yeah these are like
super buttery oh heck yeah feels a
little bit powdery but super nice
permutation and these are like pillows
off when I went to older so I originally
went into also to return stuff and I
ended up buying like 10 more things how
does that happen I wanted to try out the
l'oreal true match foundation again i
have the shade w1 this is the one i have
it's pretty light so if you have fair
skin this would probably work for you
see one is a little bit darker but it
actually matches me a little bit better
than w1w1 I need to like warm up with
bronzer and stuff I do really like the
formula and everything of this
foundation I just think it like majorly
breaks me out I'm trying it out again to
see if I notice anything but you won't I
worry yesterday I notice my neck
starting to break out but I do really
like that they have fair shades and I
like the formula of it looks really nice
on the skin
L'Oreal was a buy one get one half off I
think so I got the L'Oreal True Match
Lumi glow I haven't tried this before
but these corrector kind of shades are
usually pretty fair okay well it looks
light enough but there's not a whole lot
going on so it looks like before you
swatch it let's change over here I can
see a little like flecks of glitter what
you don't really like I don't know I
have to play around with this on my face
same kind of situation with this this is
the one wild geometric highlighting
powder this is limited edition I've seen
a few people rave about the brand-new
one my limit edition like what are they
called they have like the wave on it and
I couldn't find those those were all
sold out but I did find this one and it
was like the last one sitting there I
use this a couple times and honestly I'm
not a fan it doesn't have that great of
color payoff like I just rubbed my hand
in there a few times and even probably
use this as almost like an under-eye
finishing powder if you want like
super luminous under IR even like dust
overrides like a setting powder if you
want to make a matte foundation a little
bit more luminous because it doesn't
really have that like highlight effect
you almost can't even see it all right
this one kind of confused by I picked up
the aisle or 120 ones and I swear the
last time I got the 120 ones it was in
the orange packaging and they didn't
look like this I don't know if they
changed the lash or if I just picked up
the wrong number it might have been the
127 but whatever I really like I lower
lashes he almost look like mink lashes a
lot of them then I got this makeup
revolution salvation intense this isn't
a shade more than I could give says this
intense color high shine long-lasting
gloss and I tried this on and the colors
forget aful this is a perfect nude if
you want that pinky new but not where it
looks like too pink you know what I mean
this is just a perfect tone in my
opinion and it does have a glossy finish
so this isn't like a matte liquid
lipstick I haven't tried wearing this
all day yet I just as soon as I got this
I just put it on at night so I'm not
sure how long it lasts but the color is
beautiful and these are super reasonably
priced I really like essence lip glosses
and their couple bucks this is in the
shade glamour to go haven't tried this
yet but I have one of their other bosses
and it gives us super pretty like
reflective oh yeah this looks nice yeah
I like that
they smell not the best they smell like
lip smackers which I'm not a huge fan of
either like minty scented lip products
or no scent at all super quick before I
go into target I stopped at Sally beauty
and got that shimmer lights purple
shampoo this is why everyone says to use
for toning your hair I have an actual
toner that I'm going to be using on my
hair because there are some like super
again you can't really see in this light
there are some super brassy like blonde
tones in here and I hate warmth I'm
fighting with my hair being like a
medium brown as long as it's cool toned
so I'm going to be using the well a t18
and I think it is light ash toner and
then
we using the purple shampoo so pick this
up at Sally's because the drugstores
don't freaking sell us around here so it
was our target didn't have this either
now going on the target and when we have
three giant ass
targeted bags wasn't expecting to buy
any clothes at Target but it happened so
I've actually been looking for a new
jean jacket that isn't super tight the
one I have I think they've got in Jordan
and it's like super tight and it's kind
of cropped I don't know if it's like
shrunk in the wash or what but it's like
pretty much up to my bellybutton now I
wanted a baggy or one to wear with like
leggings and sneakers and I found the
perfect one at Target it's just this
light wash jean jacket nothing super
exciting but I like to roll up the
sleeves when I wear jean jackets and
this one is the most you mcgrann and it
was $30
I got a few super basic t-shirts my
wardrobe pretty much consists of wearing
a black white or grey teacher everyday
with some kind of like jacket over top
just got this black Moroni v-neck the
Moroni brand is super soft like all
their teachers feel like really nice
quality that I also got this one I think
this is the most amount yeah this is
most email and it's just a gray
racerback tank top and I got this wash
it's like an acid washed or whatever
they call this like corn gravy neck last
clothing item I got was that these
shorts that I'm still debating if I want
to return these or not but I really like
these and I don't really like shorts
that often these are like 12,000 not
really fashionable these are grey wait
between anyways they're like drawstring
and they're actually pretty semi long I
don't really like short shorts anymore
and I feel like these on are actually
possibly long enough to wear to work
with like wedges or something ibuprofen
and I drops because that's exciting two
kinds of different cake cups this is a
café Bustelo
these are dark roast expresso and this
is frickin a bomb if you like really
strong coffee and the K Cups don't
really do it for you try this these are
amazing why do I feel like I'm like
heckling right now I also got the donut
shop
coconut mocha
I don't usually like sweet coffee at all
I usually just have black coffee but if
I want something where I'm like thinking
about going to Starbucks I wanted to get
something where I can just pop in a
k-cup actually just made this though
well let's give it a taste so I actually
don't think this is any like added
sweetener or anything it just tastes
like flavored coffee
I'm not gonna lie I'm not really getting
the coconut in there right the mocha I'm
- my personal favorite thing at the
moment went a little wild with the
cleaning supplies when I was gone I got
really into watching clean with me
videos and like watching people's
favorite cleaning products I'm kind of
thinking about doing it clean with my
video there weirdly fun to watch if you
never watch one go YouTube it they're
pretty entertaining so this is the point
where if you're not into watching
cleaning the supplies you can just X out
don't forget to give this video a thumbs
up if you liked it up until we started
talking about fabric softener so about
this method fabric softener this is in
the scent beach sage and this is
actually on sale for like a few dollars
off it smells so freaking good I'm not
usually into this scent but there's
something about it that just smells
super fresh without smelling chemically
fresh and I've actually never used a
fabric softener I don't know it's just
never something that I grew up using
like my mom never used fabric softeners
I don't I still don't really know what
the point of them is Oh apparently it
reduces static makes ironing easier
don't iron muffins and floss fabrics
leaves a fresh scent so probably not a
whole lot but I'm gonna try it out and
you basically just put this in with your
detergent okay battery just died but we
are back folks
so this smells are freaking amazing this
is the UNSTOPABLES by Febreze fabric
refresher and I wanted something spray
on our like couch cushions and stuff you
can bend it's on fabric says it lasts up
to 7 days of fresh and I like this
because it's not super overpowering at
all it has actually like a not a huge
sin which is nice because we like
candles and everything so I didn't want
a ton of second going on
I'm just decided to spray this are
delicious braids let's try the bed
this is fun there's something so
satisfying about spring then I got the
Miss Myers hand soap in the peony scent
I can't believe they still have this
this was a limited edition like over a
year ago and they still have some of
these on the endcap thing and target so
if you have these by you get the spray I
use the multi-purpose cleaner it smells
so freakin amazing it smells like a
perfume I think I've included that in my
last target haul and I've been using it
ever since it is amazing so pick up the
hands hope you just can't go wrong I got
some reusable latex cleaning gloves
because I didn't have any and then also
the scotch-brite bathroom scrubber then
I got refills of the Clorox toilet wand
refills never thought a day would come
when I'm talking about toilet ones on my
channel these things are awesome because
I hate having a little scrubber sitting
there and just having like bacteria
built on it so basically you buy the
one-time handle thing you just insert
the refills on the end of it and you can
like scrub the toilet bowl and then you
don't literally just pop it in the
trashcan and that's it we're gonna end
off on a super exciting note clog
clearing gel all right if you liked this
video give it a thumbs up so I know let
me know down below if you want to see
more hauls and what your favorite
cleaning products are let me also know
if you want to see a clean with me video
because that's like multitasking at its
finest if I can clean my house and
filming YouTube video at the same time
let's do it love you guys thanks for
watching see ya my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
