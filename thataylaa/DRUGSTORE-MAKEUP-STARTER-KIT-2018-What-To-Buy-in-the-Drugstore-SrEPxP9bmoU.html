was good all right so today we're gonna
be talking about a drugstore makeup
starter kits the last one of these
videos I did was 2015 this is kind of
like an updated version so what I
recommend if you're in the drugstore you
have no idea where to start you're
overwhelmed I get it
there's a lot of things in there last
week I did what's in my everyday makeup
drawer so some of these products are the
same because they're things I
consistently reach for and use and
recommend this kind of geared more
towards beginners or if you're just not
super familiar with the drugstore but
also if you just need some new drugstore
makeup ideas here we go so if you're
excited for this video don't forget to
give it a thumbs up if you're new here
you can join the burrito family and
subscribe but upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. sip time when
you guys are seeing this video I'm
actually either in Chicago or I'm moving
this month is like freaking insane so
every video is majorly pre-recorded
right now so I can still get my three
week up alright so whether you're a
beginner at makeup or not I am a strong
believer in a good setting of spray any
kind of facial spray to either primary
face prep your face set your makeup I'm
a big fan of setting sprays I don't
necessarily just use it for longevity
but I also just feel like setting sprays
or any kind of facial mist can just prep
your skin so nicely and just make your
foundation and everything and your
powders kind of melt together one of my
favorite drugstore makeup prep sprays
like you would spray this on before you
start anything on your face after you
wash your face spray this on this is the
pixi hydrating milky mist so you can get
this at Target if you have dry skin I
would recommend this so this one's a
good hydrating option if you have large
pores that you need to fill in my
recommendation whether its high-end or
drugstore this is the best pore filling
primer I've ever found and wearing it
right now this is the Revlon Photoready
pore reducing primer this one does magic
for pores so many of you guys have tried
this and tweeted me saying that it's
worked wonders for you and that makes me
really happy because I do feel like this
is one of the few truly pore filling
primers out there I like this better
than benefit Porefessional like it
better than a lot of high-end ones I've
tried this one is balm is from the
drugstore by Revlon and what you do with
this is after you spray this on or after
you prep your skin with moisturizer I
just put a little bit on my fingers and
kind of just press it into my poor air
and make sure it's nice and blended out
and it's very like smooth and silky
feeling so kind of
melts into your skin right so I do a
series on my channel every single Friday
called foundation Friday where I test
out foundations so I have tons of
foundation reviews on drugstore
foundations so if you're in the
drugstore and you're curious you can
just search the tailor in the name of
any drugstore found any foundation in
general and a video should come up if I
have a video on it so I need to do a
whole other favorite drugstore
foundation video but I just wanted to
choose three which is a little excessive
in this video but for different reasons
mostly because I couldn't nail it down
Foundation is so tricky to recommend
just like blanket statement to everybody
because everyone has different skin
issues people like different kinds of
coverage finishes whether you have oily
skin or dry skin foundations are gonna
wear differently on you so right now my
skin is more on the dry side so these
foundations are based on my skin right
now I had oily skin for years so if you
want to know my favorite oily skin
foundations they just did a foundation
Friday on it but this foundation is
definitely my top like this is my go-to
number one drugstore foundation CYO long
lasting life proof foundation this is
such a beautiful dewy glowy smoothing
just makes your skin not look super
makeup yeah I'm wearing it right now I
have this shade 101 mixed in with a tiny
bit of 102 but the thing I also like
about this is that you really can kind
of make it work for whatever you're
looking for if you want more full
coverage you can build this up it covers
my scarring pretty dang well if you want
lighter coverage just use less product
and only go in with one layer you can
kind of customize this to how you want
it and it's just a all-over gorgeous
foundation this is one of my favorites
drugstore and high-end it's bomb it's
like 7 or 6 bucks from Walgreens you can
only get this on Walgreens some stores
carry it but it's been sold out a lot on
Walgreens comm so I'll link everything
I'm talking about down below this next
one I would recommend if the thought of
like a liquid foundation just totally
terrifies you I remember when I first
started wearing makeup there's something
about a liquid foundation that was like
whoa too much makeup intense then I
would recommend the Wet n Wild mega
cushion foundation this is such a
beautiful foundation again this more
glowy you can build up the coverage but
this is something that's just so quick
because the cushion foundation they
already give you the applicator in here
you just do a little that action and
then kind of dab it on your face a
sponge dries up pretty quick so make
sure you take it out and flip it over
because you're gonna get a ton more
product in there but I feel like this
could be a good beginner foundation
super affordable pretty easy to work
with and then the other one is the
flower beauty light illusion these are
all do your foundations so again way
this again check out the video but this
one I have a whole video I'm not gonna
go super in-depth about it but this one
I found during the last 15 days of
foundation series beautiful foundation
and only thing I don't like about this
is the shade I can't wear the shade on
its own so I always have to mix this one
glowy smooth flawless great so concealer
wanted to give two different options
mostly because I feel like a lot of
people probably won't be able to find
their shade in this one I do have to mix
this one this is the flower beauty of
light illusion full coverage concealer
beautiful concealer if you have drier
under eyes or you like just some more
moisturizing concealer that isn't too
creamy and it's not gonna crease it's
also great for spot concealing if I'm
just using this on no makeup kind of
days and I just want to kind of cover up
some of my acne scarring stuff I'll just
go in with this this one is just kind of
like an easy no fuss kind of concealer I
would still set it though still set your
under-eye concealer with powder I also
love the Maybelline fit me concealer
they just recently launched a lot more
shades of this concealer reminds me a
little bit of this but this one there's
something so like smooth and velvety
about the formula of this under my
all-time favorite drugstore face powders
is the Maybelline fit me loose finishing
powder this powder is beautiful it gives
you some coverage when I had oil a skin
this made my face look so smooth and so
almost like airbrush depending on what
foundation obviously you wear underneath
it shade 0-5 is actually pretty light so
it's hard to find a drugstore powder or
any powder that is fair enough I have
two bronzers I want to mention the first
one you guys can probably all guess the
Physicians Formula butter bronzer the
thing I think is great about this for
beginners is that it's a very no fuss
easy to work with kind of formula it
just blends into your skin you don't
really have to worry about doing a whole
lot of working with the brush or getting
too much product on here i associated
bronzer the lighter one looks orangie so
I like this shade my other one which I'm
wearing today I'm wearing a lot of this
on my face day by the way I say I'm
wearing to CY oh yeah - eoeo foundation
this other one I recently wished back
out again because this used to be one of
my favorites like years ago I'm pretty
sure I forgot how freaking beautiful the
tone of this bronzer is this is the MUA
bronzed perfection matte and get MUA at
CVS Ulta might also carry this online
but it's just the perfect tone it
doesn't look too
it doesn't want to oranjee on my skin
tone it's almost like kind of a milky
chocolate brown and you get a huge
frickin pan I mean look at that thing
and then for blush my top drugstore
recommendation for blush is the
physician formula butter blush same kind
of thing as the bronzer just super easy
to work with formula I'm wearing the
shade vintage Rouge right now on my face
I have I think all their blush shades in
this and I kind of just switch between
them all they're all super pretty they
all can work on my skintone I'm kind of
debating whether I should mention
contour products in this video because I
feel like if this is like a starter kit
and you're kind of more of a beginner
you probably won't be contouring but
maybe you want to so if you want a
little bit of contour in your life
totally depends with your skin tone but
if you're around my skin tone my to top
from the drugstore are the elf eyebrow
kit and light this is an eyebrow powder
I mentioned this in my everyday makeup
video but this shade right here or the
LA girl just blushing this one is a
really nice cool tone shade this is in
just because I love the packaging but
that's something it just reminds me like
a little chocolate bar or something the
shade if you use too heavy of a hand can
look very grey so you just have to be
careful with this just get a tiny amount
on your brush this one I would say is a
little bit more foolproof pretty sure I
mentioned this one in my last two
drugstore makeup starter kit videos but
I have to mention it because it's one of
my all-time favorite products Physicians
Formula natural nude shimmer brick such
a freaking beautiful face highlight it
doesn't look super textured face
highlights you can use on your
cheekbones right here you can use it on
your nose you could use a little bit on
your forehead if you want to glow you
could use this as a shadow as well these
ones can be eyeshadows I mean any
highlights I use kind of interchangeably
as eyeshadows - I like this too because
it can be used obviously on a variety of
different skin tones and then my other
one which I have to mention because you
guys know this is one of my all-time
favorite drugstore highlighter so this
one I would say is if you want an
intense highlight like if you just want
this kind of highlights what I'm wearing
right now this is the jcat you glow girl
in Bella Rose the other shades of this
highlight the jcat one I'm not a fan of
but Bella Rose is different it's not as
like glittery or chunky you get this
just super pretty intense kind of light
pinky Sheen eyeshadow palettes I just
did a video on my favorite eyeshadow
palettes under 20 bucks so a lot of
those products were drugstores if you
want to know just more in depth about
different eyeshadow palettes I recommend
and then you can kind of choose what you
want based
colors and everything check out that
video like I have to take up whoa that
was good but the reason that I picked
this one this is the monney bold
obsessions palette this one is a little
bit pricier for the drugstore it's
around 20 bucks you can get out Walmart
for 15 bucks but there are 12 shades in
here this one has a good mix of some
matte shades shimmer shades if you only
want to buy one eyeshadow palette you're
starting out you just want to kind of
play around with eyeshadows I think this
could be a really good option because
you have some smokier colors in here you
have some neutral ones you have some
shimmers some mats you can do a lot of
different looks with this I'm wearing
this on my eyes right now I'm wearing
this red shade and we're in this one
right here and it's the kind of palette
where I whenever I do it I find that I
somehow can do a totally different look
with it even though you you wouldn't
think so just by looking at it this is
what I would recommend for starters if
you want a more affordable option wet
and wild make some great palettes around
$4.99 and I talked about those in that
video can we guess this one Physicians
Formula I booster an ultra black is my
favorite liquid eyeliner from the
drugstore slash ever the so I use every
single day of my life wearing it right
now
lights on easy if you have trouble doing
a winged liner try this one out it has a
really unique kind of brush to it it's
not felt it just like glides on so easy
and this is the easiest liner I found to
get a wing with what I used to do when I
started out with makeup was at night
before I would shower I would just
practice doing a wing because even if it
looks totally shitty you just wash it
off and get in the shower just make sure
you're getting the ultra black shade big
difference between the ultra black and
the black shade black shades like gray
this makeup room is like mostly packed
so a couple of the items that I wanted
to mention this video we're actually
packed up but for a super easy brow
product if you're not someone who wants
to or feels like you can use something
like this which is my everyday one that
I use with the brush to kind of draw on
my brows if that just seems like too
much work and too overwhelming this by
the way is the Maybelline tattoo studio
it's awesome and you just want a brow
gel that's just gonna like fill in your
brows I would go in with the Ulta brow
gel
I love the Ulta brow gel I've used it
for years it was recently in my empties
video I'm gonna link it down below for a
water line eyeliner or just using if you
want not a liquid liner but you just
want to kind of smudge eyeliner on your
top lash line you can use the LA girl
glide gel liner this is a couple bucks
pretty sure this was in the last two
drugstore charter Kate videos because
this has been my favorite one
for years it stays on my waterline it's
super black it doesn't bleed into my
inner corner or anything it's just a
great all-around affordable option after
eyeliner
all right so lip products if you just
want to start out super basic and you
want a gloss as a little bit of color to
it but that's not super sticky and just
doesn't feel super high maintenance but
you want a little bit something on your
lips I'd go with the L'Oreal color what
is this called a things to color riche
it's in the shade nude ballet this one I
have but these feel so nice and smooth
and buttery I talked about things in the
everyday makeup video if you want
something with a little bit more color
payoff and that definitely feels like
you can feel it more but it's a really
great layering option so you can layer
this on top of pretty much any nude
lipstick maybelline vivid hot lacquer
and T's is one of my all-time favorite
shades I can layer it pretty much on any
nude shade and it just lightens it and
it gives it more of a cool tone look
adds a little bit of a gloss so I love
this one
liquid lipstick I feel like is not
really advanced but it just takes a tiny
bit more skill than something like a lip
gloss just because you kind of have to
get in the lines of your lips but if you
want a drugstore liquid lipstick I would
go with the L'Oreal infallible paint
mattes this is in the shade tongue-tied
I'm wearing it right now this is one of
my all-time favorite matte shades those
of you who have seen a bunch of my
videos it's probably gonna be like the
most repetitive video and playing area
so this I don't think I mentioned but
I've been trying out for a while now
since this collection launched and I
think it could be a cool thing for
beginners only because let me show it is
first so this is a white lip gloss this
is actually the Katy Perry covergirl
collection the formula this is okay it's
pretty sticky but the thing I like about
this is that it is just a straight up
it's a white lip gloss so what's cool is
you can lighten or dress pretty much any
lipstick or a lip liquid lipstick or lip
gloss shade to whatever your feelings so
if you're someone who's just starting
out with makeup and you don't have or
want twenty shades of lipstick and you
just want to be able to kind of adjust
and work with what you have this could
be a good option just to change the
shade basically my go-to mascara for
probably the last couple years is not a
drugstore on it's the Too Faced better
than sex but before that one of my go-to
is was the Maybelline falsies mascara
again all my mascara bin is totally
packed so I don't have that one to show
you but for bottom lashes I love the one
wild make a link it's a really nice
separating lengthening kind of bottom
lash mascara that's not going to
transferred if you're kind of just
curious and dabbling in the fall slash
world I have a couple options here for
you from the drugstore these ones I
would say are probably the easiest out
of any false lash I've tried to use as a
beginner and these are the aisle or
accents 0:05 the reason why these are
the easiest are because their corner
lashes so they're not gonna go if you
look at this slash it goes like pretty
far in and you can obviously trim down
lashes depending on where you want it to
start and stop
but corner lashes are great because they
basically just kind of start about here
so you don't really have to worry about
exactly placing it in the right spot it
doesn't slide around as much they're
just overall easier to work with these
ones give you a really pretty kind of
like cat eye look to if you do want
something a little bit more dramatic
outgoing with the kiss lash couture in
boudoir I still can't say this word even
after the video where I talked about
pronunciation of this word they're gonna
be linked down below but these lashes
are so nice and fluffy
the kiss slash Couture faux mink line
are in my opinion one the better
drugstore lash lines out there because
they're super fluffy but the band isn't
super thick this is just like if you
want to take it the next level but you
still want something not super super
dramatic these look kind of fluffier and
wispier if you need the lash glue which
you do don't use any of the lash glues
that come in strip lash things usually
pretty shitty use the kiss strip lash
adhesive this is lash glue I use make
sure you let these dry for about 45
seconds at least to really get it sticky
before you pop out in your eyes or
they're just gonna slide around and it
lasts kind of product category from the
drugstore is setting spray and that's
what you would spray after you finish
your entire face I like using setting
sprays even if I'm not wearing a
foundation that day just to kind of give
my face a glow make it look a little bit
more healthy but if you are wearing
foundation then I would definitely
suggest a setting spray again just kind
of melt everything together setting
sprays are pact right now the only ones
I have out right now are these two which
are both high-end but these are my most
used setting sprays if I was gonna
recommend drugstore ones though I would
say one of my favorites is the hard
candy black bottle setting spray or the
L'Oreal black bottle setting spray so
I'll have both of those down below if
you want to check them out that's what I
would recommend if you're starting out
at the drugstore of course you don't
need all of this if you are just total
overwhelmed with makeup just start slow
figure out what you like you don't need
to wear all of this you're not a
foundation person the thought of having
stuff on your face all the time
freaks you out just try a little bit of
spot concealer a little bit of blush but
makeup is fun don't be afraid of it and
I feel like it's it is very easy to get
kind of overwhelmed in the drugstore or
any makeup store because there's so much
stuff and when you don't know brands and
you don't know products it's like
starting from scratch it's almost how I
feel when I was in Europe and I was
going in the drugstore I had no idea
what brand was what what products were
known for what and it's really hard to
actually narrow down and pick something
out that's not gonna be shitty so I
totally get the feeling if you want to
follow along with Chicago and moving and
everything then make sure you're
following me on social media Instagram
snapchat my snapchat is the tail of
snaps it's not the tail about everything
else is the Tayla if you enjoyed this
video you can give it a thumbs up it
does help me out I appreciate it and I
love you guys thanks for watching see my
next video bye oh I'm back just correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
