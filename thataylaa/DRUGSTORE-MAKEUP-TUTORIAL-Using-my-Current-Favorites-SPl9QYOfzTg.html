your mom's makeup as a kid
all right so today we're doing a full
face of drugstore makeup I feel like
I've been doing so many friggin first
impressions lately because of 15 days of
foundation and just new product releases
and stuff I just wanted to sit down do a
full face and talk to you guys about my
current favorite drugstore products the
things I keep reaching for the products
I recommend and the things that you need
in your life
don't forget the 15 days of foundation
page is still up we're still shooting to
raise $20,000 by April 9th so link that
down below right at the top of the
description box if you haven't picked up
your t-shirt or my get 100% the proceeds
go to Project Beauty share and we're
getting close we're getting close
especially in the last few days you guys
have been killing it so I'm excited
let's keep it going on and up upwards
and onwards I feel like these kind of
videos are the most helpful because you
can actually see the products I'm
consistently reaching for that I
recommend and also how I use them so I
hope you guys enjoy this video if you do
while you're watching don't forget to
give it a thumbs up if you're new here
you can join the burrito family and
subscribe upload every Monday Wednesday
Friday 6:00 p.m. tip time alright I have
all of my projects in a handy little box
here so we're starting out with primer
my favorite pore filling primer whether
it's drugstore or high-end the one I
find that just works the best is the
Revlon Photoready pore reducing primer
this one is bomb I feel like this does
so much more than other pore filling
primers I've tried and I always use a
setting spray since I have dry skin
right now underneath my makeup some kind
of hydrating spray but before I do that
I'll go in with this primer if I want to
fill in kind of my pores a little bit
more that day I'll put this on my
forehead sometimes but typically I'll
just keep this around my nose area you
can see a friggin difference I think you
guys can see that I hope but it just
kind of blurs it out it really does it's
bizarre I don't know how they do it but
they did it and Revlon makes a few that
look like this so make sure you're
getting the pore reducing primer
sometimes if I have some left over I'll
just Pat some right on my pores on the
center so the spray I'll use underneath
my makeup most often are the ones I
talked about in my dry skin foundation
routine that is a routine that I still
stand by it works amazing for me if you
have dry skin check out that video but
since this is a fullface drugstore my
other kind of go-to one from the
drugstore is either the hard candy
hydrating which I cannot find right now
for the life of me
or the pixi hydrating milky mist I'm
almost like halfway done with this thing
this has hyaluronic acid in it which is
great for moisture and I'm just gonna
shake this up and then spritz them on my
face the mr. on this one is 10 out of 10
it reminds me of those things in like
hello hot places where they have the
misters outside restaurants and stuff
that's how fine the mr. on this thing
feels so my go-to foundation lately this
is like Holy Grail status for me so many
of you guys have told me you got this
and it works amazing on oily skin dry
skin normal skin depending obviously on
the products you use underneath and over
it but this is like one of those
products that I feel confident
recommending to any skin type CYO long
lasting life proof foundation if you
like dewy skin there is something so
beautiful about this foundation mixes in
well with other foundations you can get
pretty good coverage on its own
depending on how much you use but
because I'm currently trying foundations
for the wrap up video for 15 days of
foundation mixing foundations trying
them different ways today I'm gonna
actually mix the CYO long-lasting life
proof in 102 this isn't the lightest
shade usually if I use it on its own
I'll use 101 but I'm gonna try mixing
102 with la girl Pro matte foundation if
you guys saw my whole video on this you
know it was very patchy weird stuff was
happening but I feel like overall I
liked the finish of it it had this
really pretty light matte kind of finish
light as in it didn't look heavy or
cakey so I really want to try and make
this one work so CY go on its own is
perfection you can only get CYO at
Walgreens I've only been able to find it
online Walgreens I'm terrified that
they're gonna discontinue this so I
literally already have three backups of
the shade one and one I have a shade
dark for like in the options that I have
her self tan again I just mixed way too
much whoops oh man it makes this light
so the LA girl 1 oxidizes a lot and
actually the 102 shade of CYO oxidizes
but the 101 shade doesn't this is gonna
look light at first and then it should
kind of oxidize to the correct shade
alright basically this was me babbling
on about lighting for like 3 minutes so
I just fast forwarded everything long
story short I'm working on the lighting
whoo that does not look good on my
forehead actually really don't like this
combo dude I cannot
this one work I've been trying
everything I mix it with I have not
liked it with still is looking pretty
patchy and it actually looks pretty bad
on my forehead so I'm gonna take some of
CYO 101 just by itself and put that
right on the center just to hopefully
kind of smooth things out a bit make it
look a little bit better if not I'm
gonna be wiping all this off and we're
gonna redo this
okay that's helping still looking a
little tragic this is another way I use
CYO though is if I have a foundation
that's just totally not sitting well on
my face I'll just pop some of this on
the center and it just kind of makes the
rest of your face look better because
you still have this glowy smooth Center
at least so moving on to concealer I
actually have been trying so many
concealers pretty much throughout the 15
days actually when I test them with
foundation I don't pull it all the way
down I just keep it right under here so
it doesn't affect the foundation at all
but there's been so many new concealer
launches so I'm thinking for foundation
Friday this week before the wrap up
video goes up on Monday
I think this foundation Friday I'm gonna
do kind of like a concealer round up
what I've been thinking of all these new
concealer launches let me know if you
guys want to see that but there been a
few new drugstore concealer lunches the
first one I tried out during 15 days of
foundation during the light illusion
that I told you guys about this flower
beauty one I am gonna be using today but
it's too dark on its own it's actually
looking light on camera see what the
heck man it looks darker than my
foundation in real life right now so
because of the shade I'm gonna mix in a
little bit of the Maybelline fit me the
new lightest shade now this shade is
pretty yellow so I don't love this on
its own I actually prefer the shade 15
over this shade 5 same with the new
shade of the Maybelline instant age
rewind also doesn't work for my skintone
because it's just so yellow a couple of
the foundation videos you guys were
commenting how bright and yellow my
under eyes were and I know it's because
I was trying these out but I'm just
gonna blend this out with my morphe G 38
my favorite concealer combo lately is
not drugstore but I'll talk about it in
Friday's video the concealer video the
flower Beauty concealer is beautiful on
its own I just wish they came out with
more shades I found a lot of questions
from you guys on snapchat lately about
what I have been using to brighten up my
under eyes so much some days I feel like
it looks too bright like I'm like whoa
need to tone it down bright because this
prod
I'm gonna talk about can look a little
bit overpowering but I think if you have
fair skin this could be a lifesaver for
the under eyes because as we know it's
hard to find powders that are light
enough render there I've talked about my
physicians for me the correcting powder
for years but this one just the formula
of it has been kind of stepping stepping
above it a little bit this is actually
from the whish makeup video you can find
this brand on Amazon though it's not a
wish only thing not that makes it any
less sketchy I'm just saying but this
just says made sure pressed powder and
it is this soft soft light white it has
a little bit of a yellow tint which I
think it's why I can look a little bit
much on me I don't use this on its own
because it would be way too brightening
so I actually mix in my Physicians
Formula powder this is the same powder I
mix in with the correcting powder
normally this one's in the shade
translucent light so when I mix these
two together they just make a really
great shade as long as I don't get too
much of this white one because again you
can look very Casper very quick with
this one it gives you this almost like
airbrushed under-eye kind of look very
soft beautiful powder and it's a few
bucks which is why I'm including it in
this video
drugstore priced if not cheaper but if
you want a drugstore option I always use
the Physicians Formula correcting powder
too so the brush I've been using lately
is the BH Cosmetics 1:37 and then I'll
just press it under my eye and if I feel
like I got too much Physicians Formula
like this time I did like it just
darkened it a little bit I'll just go in
with some more of the white overtop and
you'll see it just brighten right up and
it just gives you this very flawless
soft kind of look under there I wish
they made kind of a more salmon toned
one because I do find sometimes a yellow
tone can be a little bit much on my skin
tone but for some people that would work
great
I don't like dragging this I just
pressed this on that's what gives me the
best coverage underneath my eyes and
using a brush like this it's a little
bit more dense instead of like a loose
fluffy brush just doesn't work for my
under eyes so this next product is one
that I've tried multiple times and I
still don't quite know what I think of
it this is the flower Beauty
illuminating was called satin miracle
glow satin finishing powders this is
supposed to be like a glowy setting
setting powder not setting spray so
today I kind of just wanted to give this
one another go I always use the for less
cb4 brush with any powders I apply and I
kind of Pat it on so I don't hopefully
remove any of the foundation underneath
and this one is so hit or miss for me I
feel like it really depends on the
foundation I have underneath it I feel
like I need a ton of bronzer right
now I'm not gonna powder my forehead I
like the dewy look and especially with
that combo that I didn't like today not
gonna mess it up more with powder not
quite as bad as some loose powders
actually did in Monday's video the Becca
better whoa definitely doesn't give me
as bad of results as a lot of loose
powders do if you saw Monday's video you
know I'm talking about I still want to
say I like this one I'm gonna actually
take a little bit of the Physicians
Formula one just to get that coverage
back there we go
Physicians Formula always comes through
so I have two drugstore brow products
that I have been really enjoying lately
the first one is the Maybelline tattoo
studio brow gel in the shade deep brown
now this product I love the finished
result of and I like the actual formula
I don't like anything about this but
when I have it on in the way that I'm
going to show you how I apply it I
really like it I don't think this is
gonna be for everyone because it's not
actually like a brow gel I feel like
this is more of remember that NYX
waterproof like this squeeze to brow
product it almost is more like that I
think they should have made it in that
kind of packaging where you just squeeze
them out depression and then go in and
apply it because this really does not
work brushing on to your brows you get
way too much product
it kind of just clumps on this
applicator and it just turns into a
total disaster so the way that I like to
apply this is by just dipping my brush
actually right onto there and then going
into my brow the other product I've been
like in this one is like a more recent
fine for me as the brow stylist boost
and set and this one I also don't think
it's gonna be for everyone if you don't
like the crunchy kind of brow where you
can feel it on you won't like this but I
really love the applicator of this like
finally someone is making a brow product
that has a small brow thing that you can
just brush on I like this for more
natural days if I'm doing a full-on brow
I'll usually go into the maybelline one
but if I want just a quick fill-in kind
of thing I'll go in with this one wish
they made a darker shade because this is
the darkest and it's not that dark but
today we're gonna use the Maybelline one
so I literally just dip my brush onto
this thing
before I do that I spoiling my brows but
I have no idea where my spoolie thing is
found him so I'm gonna pull this out
first
sudden I just just go in and fill it in
like I normally would with like a dip
brow or something and I love the shade
of this I find it hard to find a brown
that's not too warm but also that's not
too gray and this one is just like the
exact shade that I want in life so I'm
gonna be having a shadow and shmooze
coming I wanted to wait until after the
wrap-up video so I could kind of talk
about the series and everything and just
how everything went I cannot wait to get
my brows touched up once I'm off
accutane I'm just like so excited to do
a bunch of treatments I want to get
facials I want to do micro needling for
scarring let me know if you guys would
want me to document that kind of stuff
so my favorite drugstore eye primer is
actually the Maybelline instant age
rewind concealer I've talked about this
before it's a great eye primer just dab
it on blend it out okay so this product
is a totally unnecessary step but I just
wanted to show you this because I use
this in a different way than I think
it's intended for but I actually really
like how it looks when I use it like
this what I'm about to show you but this
is the Milani prep set and glow powder I
don't like this eyes and all of our face
powder but I really like this on natural
days actually as like an under eye
brightener it gives you a very like
lifted illuminated look without looking
like you have extra tip highlighter
underneath your eyes kind of just
brightens everything or even just as a
really subtle highlight like on the
cheekbone right here as you can see it
just gives you like a really pretty
subtle glow and it just kind of lifts in
brightens and I do like to bring it kind
of into my inner corner I like the look
of a little bit illuminated under eyes
it just makes you look not quite as dead
I'm just applying this where I normally
would a highlighter too that's kind of
weird though this smells like when you
go through your mom's makeup as a kid
feel like I need some major warmth to my
face right now so we're gonna use this
is one of my favorite drugstore bronzers
ever Physicians Formula butter bronzer
not the lightest shade if you have
around my skintone do not get the
lightest shade I find it to pull so much
more orange on my skin than the shade
bronzer which is the shade up
so because I feel like I needed to warm
up my skin a lot right now I am gonna
bring this up to my temples I kind of
just do whatever I'm feeling sometimes I
do with bronzer sometimes I feel like it
just makes me look like too muddy or
something almost this blush shade is so
freakin beautiful this is Rosa Romantica
by Milani this shade I recently picked
up and it just looks so beautiful it
gives you like a a warm but bronzy kind
of glow I feel like this is gonna be so
pretty in the summer I have a lot of
drugstore or favorite highlighters but
my probably all-time top for the longest
period and one that I'm still using to
this day is the natural nude shimmer
brick by Physicians Formula you can use
this on eyes face whatever you want I
think I want like a mix of these ones I
don't want a totally white highlight
today so I'm gonna do kind of like the
champagnes over here oh my gosh if you
have not picked this up yet go drive
yourself to Rite Aid CVS Walgreens
whatever you want and pick this guy up I
don't like to bring my highlighter all
the way up on my nose I usually just put
it on the tip and then my Cupid's bow
and then to kind of blend everything
together I just go back on with that
same brush and blend sometimes leave and
rub this over then it was a little bit
just add some color there so like I said
my favorite setting sprays right now
aren't drugstore but I kind of want to
try this one today the Mon you make it
last I feel like I've tried this
probably in a video before but I do not
remember what I think this i coat every
freaking inch of my face with setting
spray setting spray just really helps to
melt all those powders together and make
your skin look more like skin especially
if you have dry skin that smell very
perfumey we'll see if that kind of
mattifies a little bit as it dries but
right now it's giving me a really pretty
glow eyeshadow palette from the
drugstore that I'm completely completely
obsessed with right now is money bold
obsessions and also the Milani most
loved mattes these are the new Milani
palettes obviously I think there are 20
bucks if you look at like L'Oreal
pellets Maybelline pellets now they're
pellets that I'm pretty sure have left
shades in this are around like 15 16
bucks now the drugstore is not
what it used to be back in the day you
get twelve shades in each one these
palettes and they are one of the best if
not the best drugstore eyeshadow formula
I have ever felt they are so beautiful
to work with they blend out effortlessly
they're pigmented they're just
everything you want in an eyeshadow they
are a hundred seven or twenty bucks in
my opinion I've been trying out the visi
art palettes not impressed not impressed
and those things are freaking eighty
bucks I would spend 80 bucks on this
over that visi art palette for 80 bucks
here's the other one I have no idea what
kind of look I want to go for today I
kind of want to just do like a neutral
everyday kind of look since I feel like
that's kind of the theme of this video
just like the makeup I've been using and
everything and also I don't feel like
I've done just like a basic brown smokey
eye lately for like a talk-through
tutorial whatever this is just have not
that concealer a little bit I like this
setting spray did give me a glow and it
feels like kind of locked everything in
so I'm gonna start out with this shade
right here for the crease it feels weird
titling videos like this or calling
videos like tutorials because I
literally I'm just putting makeup on my
face I'm just gonna play with makeup and
however it turns out it turns out I'm
not a makeup artist I just I just like
makeup over here
I loved one of the comments on the ten
year old does my makeup video where
someone was saying it's so refreshing
seeing someone just have so much fun
with makeup and it almost like gives you
a reminder that that's what this is
makeup is fun you can do whatever the
heck you want it's just a creative
outlet you may be able to use this like
champagne shade yeah
maybe we won't do all matte I kinda want
to use that champagne shade I'm gonna go
back in with the matte spell at first so
I've been loving this japonesque brush
it's kind of just like the you know like
Mac 215 or Sigma makes wants more feet
they all make brushes like this but this
one is hello softest japonesque one I
got it on sale at Ulta I'm gonna take
this shade right here I'm kind of
lightly bringing it inwards
I'm gonna blend it out afterwards I'm
just kind of placing it down
I always do a step kind of messy because
I'm gonna be putting lid shades and
other shades down anyway so I'm just
gonna go in with my big fluffy blending
brush this is the morphe I'm five-eleven
just realized I had this electronic
sitting on a wet white lips I'm gonna
take this brown shade right here I don't
think I've used this one yet it doesn't
look like it I'm just placing this right
into the crease to deepen it up a bit
right there
and whenever I'm doing eyeshadow I have
to let my eyes drop because if you're
going like this
eyes look totally different than when
you're actually like resting in position
you know so let's try and drop it down
so I can see what it's actually gonna
look like now I'm gonna go into that
champagne shade I keep talking about
this one right here from the bold
obsessions palette I'm just gonna take
it on my finger these are so so soft and
press it onto my lid I'm just bringing
it into the other colors I'm gonna go
back in and blend some more Brown into
that shade but look at that this is not
what I am gonna wet it just to get an
extra extra pop so to wet that lid shade
I'm gonna dip my brush in there as
always dip it into the powder before I
spread my setting spray because if you
spray wet on the brush and then dip into
the powder it'll create like a weird
texture in the powder I'm just using the
same Milani one and then I'm gonna pop
this on the lid there kind of fuse those
together I'm going to take this shade in
the most loved mattes just kind of blend
this into the middle connecting that
deeper Brown with that champagne shade
I'm still gonna work on the lower lash
line but first I'm just gonna add a
black liner for the waterline my
favorite one is the LA girl glide on gel
pencil this one is by Maybelline because
I need to freakin get a pencil sharpener
and just spend a few minutes sharpening
all of my black liners they all need to
be sharpened besides this one I just
used like three different liners cuz
they all ran out now I'm gonna go in
with the black shade in here on a flat
edge liner brush and almost like stamp
it on under there and I don't bring this
all the way into my inner corner or else
it just totally kind of closes off my
eyes gonna look a little wild a little
off until I have my top lashline
finished with liner and lashes and
everything but I'm going to take a small
blending brush and just go back with
some of the shades we use
the top so I'm going to start out with
this one right here we're gonna do some
top liner now to even everything out I'm
taking my physicians formula eye booster
and ultra black make sure you get ultra
black not the regular black one I kind
of want to blur and like smoke this out
and putting on accent lashes in the
corner which I feel like has actually
really been helping with the whole
folded lid situation because anytime I
do a wing lately even if it's a small
wing it just looks so off because my
eyes fold right here so I've been doing
to kind of get around that is either
smoking out the line so it's like a
blurred line or putting on accent lashes
because it just totally hides up but
still gives you kind of the effect of
having bigger eyes I'm gonna take that
same black and just smoke out this liner
it's it kind of like a Messier smokier
look okay so the plan was to pop on
these accent lashes these are totally
goners these are dead they are destroyed
and used I've used these so many times
now so I need to stock up on these
because I love these ones so I just went
with my other favorites by Laura these
are the number 121 so I'm gonna go in
with my same eyeliner and make sure the
band is covered up for bottom lash
mascara I always used wet and wild make
Elaine so that's what I put on she want
to go back in with the physicians for me
thing and just use the whitest light
shade right here as an inner corner
highlight brighten everything up a
little bit look at the difference that
that makes as I was just pulling my lip
stuff out that box I totally forgot
about the contour shade I want to tell
you guys I've been loving this is the LA
girl just blushing and just because if
you have fair skin this is a great
contour that's like a few bucks so I'm
just gonna add a little bit of
definition gotta use a light hand with
this one so it doesn't look ashy but you
can get this online Ulta no I'm not sure
if they have it in stores too now we've
got a little more cheekbones so for lips
I think I did this combo during 15 days
of foundation but I've been really
liking both of these products on their
own this is the LA girl non-stop nude
liner and then I'm gonna top it off with
the Maybelline and vivid hot lacquer and
T's I love this shade I feel like use
this like ten times throughout the 15
days don't love the smell this this
liner is super smooth feeling just kind
of glides over
then I'm gonna go over this with the
Maybelline product and this feels like
buttery smooth going on this gloss and
as you can see this is just lightening
it way up this is the final look doing a
full face of some of my current favorite
drugstore products let me know if you
guys have tried any of these things what
you think of them if you do try anything
