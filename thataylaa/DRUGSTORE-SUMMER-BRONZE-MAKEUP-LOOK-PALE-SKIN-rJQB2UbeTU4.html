basically my two favorite things in life
all right so today we have is shadow
inch mousse and I look I'm wearing right
now this is a summer bronzy makeup
tutorial if you're a pale princess this
will work on you if you have pale skin
you know it's really hard to do a glowy
bronzy kind of look without looking like
your orange this computer is super
distracting okay so this is something
that works for my skintone I didn't do
foundation in this video because I'm
going to be doing a first impression on
this guy so make sure you're subscribed
so you don't miss out on that I'm also
going to be doing another unboxing of
the love with food box over here we're
going to be eating and putting on makeup
and it's going to be a good time if
you've never heard of love with food
they're basically an all-natural snack
box I've gotten to so far I've really
enjoyed both of them I'll have links and
coupon codes in the downbar if you guys
want to check them out I really like him
it's also awesome because every box that
you buy they donate a meal to a family
in need so I just think that's awesome
and I like how it's not a box it's an
actual meal so if you're curious the
meal that you buy for someone will be
going to food lifeline in shoreline
Washington so if you want to see how I
got this look you're in the right place
just keep watching alright so I already
have my face makeup on because I'm in
the middle of recording a first
impressions video on this foundation
this will be up after this video so I
have my love with food box right here
this is the deluxe box they also have a
tasting box and a gluten-free box so
Fiesta I'm actually starving right now
so this is perfect it looks like this is
all Fiesta themed this is awesome
if there's a burrito in here I might
 my pants kind of feeling the sweet
right now actually no sometimes opening
a bag of chips is like not even worth
the extra chips okay we're going to
taste the bean and rice pico de gallo
chips they smell amazing
user good I can't tell my foundation is
luminous or if I'm just sweating right
now because it's literally 90 degrees in
this room these are really good they're
gluten-free and they have four grams of
protein but they don't taste gluten-free
at all so I'm going to zoom you guys in
a tiny bit so you can see it my eyeballs
all the products I'm going to be using
today are drugstore so I'm starting out
with the Maybelline Color tattoo this is
in the shade barely beige this might
have been a limited edition but you can
use any other color tattoos they make
like a taupe one that's totally fine the
lighter the better because we're not
going to be putting super dark
eyeshadows on in mine is clearly a
little bit dried out I think I've had
this for like two years
this is the sun-baked two neutrals
palette from Maybelline this is one of
my favorite drugstore palettes I feel
like this product is completely
underrated I went through a phase like
sophomore year college where I wore this
every single day comment down below if
you've been with me for that long so I'm
going to start with this light topi
shade right here and just put this in
the crease and all of the eye brushes
I'm using today are from Sedona lace
like usual they are my fav pop chips
I love pop chips we're just working out
with gold scissors these are BBQ potato
flavored this taste is actually like the
Lay's barbecued chips I'm just putting a
little bit more in the crease just to
deepen it up a little bit alright next
we're gonna take this copper shade which
is frickin beautiful I'm going to take
my finger and just put a little bit of
the copper on my finger obviously look
at that like what the heck this is like
one of those products I always forget
how amazing it is until I pick it up
again I'm just bringing this as far up
into the crease as I can with my finger
don't worry if you can't get it all the
way up in there next I'm going to go in
with this dark brown matte shade in the
palette and take this like little round
C brush we're just going to place this
on like the outer third I'm going to
slightly bring this into the crease
mostly just focus it on the lid and
blend it into that copper color I'm just
blending whatever is left over a little
bit in these also just blend out super
easily on their own like I feel like
that was way easier than it usually is
then I'm going to take the lightest
curly white shade in this palette and
I'm going to put it on this little
pointed brush and then we're going to
spray it I usually just use setting
spray because it totally works fine use
whatever setting spray or water you have
this is the hard candy fast and fabulous
I actually don't like this setting spray
which is why I use it for things like
wedding an eye shadow we're just going
to put this on the inner corner of the
eye I think I got enough on there really
coat that thing I think I might have had
some yeah awesome
definitely had some leftover blue
eyeshadow on there we're going to go in
with the lighter gold shade in here and
I'm just going to take my finger and put
that on top of there in the inner corner
ah the shade is so frickin pretty it
just gives it like a light gold effect
I'm going to take that same C shaped
brush use this taupey color that we used
in the crease and I'm just going to
bring that down a little bit I'm just
going to focus this on the outer third
for an inner corner highlight I'm going
to go in with my Physicians Formula
shimmer brick I've talked about this
before and I freaking love this thing it
is gorgeous I love this for eyes for
face for whatever I'm going to go on the
lightest white pearly shade in here with
my finger and this is awesome for an
inner corner highlight and I'm just
going to bring that on the bottom a
little bit for the waterline I'm going
to go in with a Remmel London scandalize
this is just like a light creamy beige
color this will just help open up our
eyes if you don't want to do a white
eyeliner because it's too intense or
whatever go for a light creamy nude one
it'll still help open up your eyes but
it won't like be like holy the
girls wearing white eyeliner I just
literally sprayed my entire mirror
soaking wet with that setting spray now
your clean so with this look you could
totally wear eyeliner or skip the
eyeliner and just do falsies I think I'm
either gonna do eyeliner with the 1:02
demi whispies which were just kind of
like more natural lashes or I'm only
going to go in with the 205's fire
Verdell so I'm just going to see what
these look like
angles are too much for what I'm feeling
right now so I'm just going to go in
with my favorite Physicians Formula i
booster my eyeliner takes me two seconds
because of this thing
it's magical I always just like to start
with the base and do one straight line
across once that base is on there I
usually just like to start dragging from
a little bit in from where you want your
wing to end then just fill it in about
to sleep then all I do is literally lick
all right so that literally took me like
I don't know 45 seconds tops
whoa totally forgot to eat I don't think
I've ever said that sentence in my life
before so this looks really interesting
this is Montana Mex chili salt my
roommate is gonna love this I'm not a
big chili fan but she will love that
he's like Bom okay so these are
educational cookies you can learn
English and Spanish at the same time
that's kind of smart hmm love with food
always has their shortbread cookies down
mini lemon burst cookies and as I'm
eating these I'm just gonna go in with
I'm put my falsies on some use the 102
Demi's by our dill these are gluten free
whole grain and nut free they kind of
taste like ginger snap consistency like
they're super crispy we've got falsies
on I really freaking like these false
lashes I'm gonna go in with some mascara
just to blend the false lashes with my
natural lashes I have a shadow in this
video where I go like super in depth
about how I apply false lashes and
mascara afterwards and everything so I
will link that down below if you haven't
seen it yet well the lash gluing was
happening I ate these PD thins crackers
pretty much the entire bag these were
bombed they're super salty so hydrate
ladies
wow that Mir was just literally up my
nose these look amazing these are chili
pecan takes it's just like cornets I'm
gonna save these because I'm going to
put them in my purse for later creamed
honey with hibiscus I'm not sure if
you're supposed to put this in like
coffee where do you put honey oh
awesome we'll get that later you look
really good this is banana and
raspberries it's equal to one cup of
fruit freeze-dried fruit mix it's not
what like astronaut tea in space
it kind of tastes exactly like those
strawberries in like Special K it's a
little hard for me to tell in this
viewfinder when it's too bright or dark
so I apologize I'm going with
wet-and-wild Magelang for the bottom
watches those freeze dried raspberries
really getting the teeth if you get
mascara on your chin or anywhere else on
your body
you like I did wait for it to completely
dry and then you can just rub it away
the last couple things in here there's
some gluten-free pasta some coconut and
pink guava fruit ice they always have
like a thing that shaped in these boxes
since we're going for a warm bronzy
summery kind of look I'm going to take
this Physicians Formula City glow Paris
bronzer and this is definitely more of a
warm toned bronzer I'm just going to put
it on my cheekbones and blend it a
little bit up on there - not really
contouring I'm also going to put this on
my temples just whatever is left over on
the brush if you have pale skin you want
to be careful when you do this part
because it can easily look overdone I'm
also going to bring a tiny bit of this
on the side of my nose kind of
contouring kind of just evening out the
face so we don't have like all white in
the center you can also apply this on
the bottom just to sculpt out your chin
get away that double chin you know I'm
saying now we're going to go back in
with this guy what pressure want to use
this one I'm just gonna swirl it mostly
in like the pinky lighter shades
obviously if you have darker skin you
can go in with the darker shades and
this just gives you such a pretty glow
look at that I'm going to put a tiny bit
of this on my nose just because I want
it to look like not like we're sunburned
but we got a little bit of Sun whoa just
figure it out how to turn the brightness
down perfectly just go in with that
light highlight shade this is super
intense
so tap it off and we're just gonna put a
little bit on the cheekbones hell yeah
I'm also going to apply a tiny bit on
our Cupid's bow not that we need it so
I'm sweating and then down the bridge of
my nose there we go let's move on to
lips for lips I'm going to try out this
essence lipliner in 11 in the nude I've
never tried this before but I've tried
they're one of their other shoes and I
do really like their lip liners they're
like a dollar fifty we're just going to
line
these glide-on super easily who I really
like this color so I just lined my
entire lips with that and then I'm going
to go in with color pop skimpy or cookie
I don't know you might use both so when
I go in with the shade cookie by color
pop first and then go in with skimpy I
think it'll be yeah was like the exact
color is this that worked out well
I love how moisturizing these color pop
ones make your lips look they kind of
just cover up all of the fine lines and
cracks and stuff so we're going to go in
with Skippy and just put this and we'll
see everywhere all right so this is the
final look if you guys liked this video

I got freeze-dried raspberry my throat
