of cereal in it it's no Captain Crunch
all right so today we're gonna be doing
a drugstore try on haul first
impressions kind of video I've never
done a try on haul video but I like the
concept it's basically exactly what it
sounds like you haul stuff and you try
it on your face there are a ton of
new drugstore releases right now I hold
a lot of them in my last haul video and
I also have a bunch of new stuff in this
video to show you guys I'm kind of doing
a mix of those two trying out the new
wet and wild eyes shadow palettes the
makeup revolution concealer which is a
hot topic right now Hot Topic is that
video coming
oh that video will be coming I did a
full face of hot topic makeup for this
video I'm super excited because I got to
work with one of my favorite brands
again that I've worked with for years
now on my channel because I genuinely
use them every single time I shop online
I've gotten my whole family hooked on it
I've used Ebates for years over the
years I've literally gotten thousands of
dollars of cash back from Ebates because
you basically just get money for the
shopping that you are already gonna do
they have over two thousand retailers in
there so if you're shopping online they
probably have your store on there every
single time I'm ordering from Sephora
Ulta forever21 booking.com whether it's
makeup travel stuff I always go through
Ebates you literally just type in the
site so you just type in Sephora calm or
they have an app too or you can use like
the browser button type it in click
through it'll tell you what cashback it
is and then you just keep shopping super
easy to use if you're new to eBay is to
give you $10 welcome bonus on your first
$25 purchase and they do triple cashback
promotions all the time where they just
like switch out the retailers that are
triple or double cashback so I'll have
those listed down below which ones are
currently triple cashback but whenever
Sephora and all the make up sites are
double cashback or triple cashback I
always do my shop and then because save
more money okay
this lip gloss is like doing things in
the crease right here so all this stuff
I purchased online through Ebates
whether it was from Walgreens or Ulta
most of the stuff I got at Ulta but I'll
link everything down below along with
the link to Ebates right at the top of
the description box so if you're excited
for this video and you enjoy while
you're watching don't forget to give
this a thumbs up if you're new here you
can join the BAE radio family and
subscribe I upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time
this week schedule it's a little bit
different there's a really exciting
video coming tomorrow but I talked more
about that in the video so if you want
to see how I got this full face a
drugstore look you're in the right place
just keep watching okay
my bun and my face in the same shot here
while still being closed up so I'm just
gonna look like this so Washington
moisturize my face we have like 10,000
primers here this is the wet and wild
dewy face primer then I also have these
three products covergirl one is the
vitalist go glow luminizing lotion so
you could probably use this mixed in and
I have two shades of the L'Oreal True
Match Lumi the lotion like what you did
their natural glow enhancer I was
thinking this one I could mix in to
darken a to light foundation and give it
some glow and this one could be like a
lightning one or just if this doesn't
have a lot of pigment in it just give it
a glow I think I kind of just want to
use those shade 9:01 as like a base
this looks pretty glowy in my hands it
feels like a khaki kind of lotion not
too tacky but once it sets down it does
have kind of a little stick to it okay
can these baby hairs get out of here
definitely glowing has a nice stick to
it I probably stay away from my pores
next time because it's definitely
accentuating those I picked up essences
new foundation which is the freshened
fit awake makeup healthy glow but I'm
going to be saving this for 15 days of
foundation speaking of 15 days of
foundation exciting news the 50 days of
foundation announcement video is
actually coming tomorrow Thursday I know
I usually upload Monday Wednesday Friday
but I wanted to post it on March 1st
there won't be a video on Friday this
week because it'll be Thursday the
announcement video instead so you guys
are gonna be learning everything about
what I've been working on for forever
now with Project Beauty share the 15
days of foundation series everything is
gonna be talked about in that video
that's what's coming tomorrow 6 p.m.
Pacific time don't forget to come back
turn on your notifications because it
probably won't show up in the feed
anymore I hope you're as excited as I am
okay I feel like I really need the
button frame kind of look like a what's
this
pee-wee Herman so I'm gonna actually do
a redo a repeat of the L'Oreal
infallible Pro glow I have a review on
this this foundation really did not work
for me when I had oily skin so I'm gonna
try actually mixing it with a little bit
of the covergirl clean matte 510
I haven't mixed these two together yet
so we'll see how does this covergirl
clean matte BB cream 510 if you have
oily skin one of my all-time favorite
products this thing is amazeballs for
controlling oil even just mixing in with
other foundations to control the oil go
down with my Sigma
old-time favorite so both of those
foundations I find our about medium
coverage
L'Oreal like light to medium the
covergirl one you can build up though
see it's great here what is this this is
25 mmm doesn't look bad doesn't look
good definitely need some setting spray
or something up in here I do like the
shade of these to mix together though it
has a nice light beige tone which is
what my favorite undertone I can make is
speaking of mixing foundations I did a
whole mixing all two hundred-plus of my
foundations together video it was quite
the experience let me tell you feeling
really energetic right now and it's like
a DM what the heck I had tea
I had one cup of coffee but then I had
tea cuz my throat like slightly sick
right now
do I need to drink tea more often yeah
not looking good on my forehead I have a
 ton of concealers to try out so I
think I'm just gonna try and smooth out
my forehead with some concealer and do
like a little highlight action because
not loving this combo so I picked up
four different concealers here at the
first one I'm definitely enough in try
out because I know I love this concealer
it's just a lighter shade which is so
exciting this is the maybelline instant
age rewind they came out a lighter shade
100 so excited to try this because this
concealer is one of my all-time favorite
concealers I think I just said that I
also came out with a new shade of the
fit me which I got picked up the
covergirl vitalists healthy concealer I
love the covergirl vitalist foundation
but it's way too dark so I have to mix
it and this concealer definitely looks
too dark too so I think I'm gonna skip
this one for this video model zone cover
it I hold this in the last haul I did
the full coverage concealer in the shade
light one I want to try this but I
definitely want to try it this guy I'm
so curious about this this is the makeup
revolution conceal and define I got the
lightest shades c1 so we're gonna try
this thing today okay Wow
giant friggin applicator on this thing
this is almost like the Clinique
foundation wand like it's that large and
in charge so let's do this definitely
quite yellow I'm gonna blend this out
with my brush that I always use might do
my finger on the other side just to see
I'm not getting very good coverage seems
to be setting down nicely doesn't feel
super tacky drying pretty quick so I'm
gonna go in with my finger on this side
I'm getting better coverage on the
finger side a little bit still not full
coverage just not covering my darkness
at all and I can still see my freckles
coming through right there I don't love
this I don't think it's making my under
eyes look extra dry particularly I just
don't like the cover it's not really
covering so I'm actually gonna build
this up a little bit with should we try
this one let's try it I'm filming 15
days of foundation videos almost every
single day so I haven't been able to
like try out new concealers because I
don't want it to affect the foundation
so I'm gonna try as many as I can in
this one
this looks pretty thick oh well okay
little bit one way I'm gonna spread this
over to this side little goes a very
long way this almost reminds me of the a
cosmetics one that shade is nice and
brightening okay now we're getting some
coverage folks I think I'm gonna bring a
little bit of that one to highlight the
center of my face
to do a brush now let's do a sponge this
is dry now let's do a brush that's like
totally taking away my foundation right
there product is not wanting to stick
right to the center of my forehead you
know what let's go in with concealer
number three only thing is when you get
a new one of these you have to like
twist this for a freaking hour there we
go I'm just gonna quit while we're ahead
might just be my skin right now it's
like not wanted to stick right there I
do have new powders to try so hopefully
that'll bring it together for my under
eyes I'm gonna use powders that I know
work well because my under eyes are
weird so I've actually been using my
normal Physicians Formula powder mixed
with the may cheer pressed powder which
was from the wish makeup video this is
like a couple bucks ingredients probably
not the best in here but it really
smooths and brightens the under eyes if
you have fair skin super super soft
powder it's way too light if I go in
with just that which is why I add some
this Physicians Formula powder so I'm
just going to stamp this on that model
zone concealer is looking pretty nice I
typically kind of stay away from where'd
it go packaging like this just because
it's a pain in the ass to use I would
try that models own one again not a fan
of this one that's a bummer I kind of
had high hopes for this one so picked up
two loose powders but I'm very
to try these because they're both kind
of like glowy finishing powders which if
I'm gonna be using a powder on my skin
as it is the only powders I use our like
glowy ones this is a flower beauty satin
finishing powder miracle glow just add
that totally backwards
oh cool packaging it's like flat on this
side and then round then I also picked
up the NYX holographic halo it says this
is a finishing powder it looks like it
has like a blue kind of tint to it so
I'm really curious about this might
first try this just on this area so in
case it does have more like a highlight
look I like this on my cheekbones so
both of these are loose powders there
are very few loose powders that work for
my skin I find that they typically take
away any coverage that I have underneath
and they just don't sit well on my skin
at all there are a couple that I love
the Maybelline fit me loose powder that
one's amazeballs also the cover FX one I
might do a video on my favorite powders
I mean if you guys want to see that I
actually have them sitting on the corner
of my desk so I was gonna film that a
while ago so curious about this okay I'm
just gonna take some on my finger this
looks for again purple feel like it
looks white on camera but in real life
it has this like purple reflect to it
that totally looks purple I'm gonna try
that just on this area first like I said
and then I might use the flower beauty
one on the rest of my face what the heck
I hope that's showing up on camera it
looks purple friggin blue I'm turning
down lights what is this
no no way I'm brushing this off the
brush so I don't keep putting more
purple crap on my face maybe for a
highlight if you like a purple blue
highlight but as a finishing powder no
way Jose I'm using a bigger fluffy brush
to try and blend this in and it's just
kind of stuck there alright flower
Beauty come to the rescue please Oh
interesting this one has a little color
to it so that's good we can cancel out
some of this purple are you supposed to
tap this in here that would be a genius
if so hard to see the depth so I'm
sticking my fingers in here but this
looks like a little Bowl which is really
nice if you're supposed to tap that in
there which I'm assuming you are here's
where the powder comes out oh I'm
excited for this one when I use a loose
powder I do like using a stiffer big
brush just again so it doesn't take away
as much coverage I like to Pat it on
first and then kind of blend it out
slowly so this is the furless see before
it's what I always use for any kind of
powder loose powder or pressed powder
I'm gonna try it first on this cheek
just so it doesn't mess with the purple
I think that's giving a very slight glow
see how it looks on the center of my
forehead I'm gonna switch brushes to my
under eye brush just for right on the
center and then switch back to the
bigger one okay it definitely gives it
glow you can see there on my forehead
that looks pretty nice for a loose
powder on my skin this is going pretty
well it usually looks a lot worse than
this my forehead has a nice glow to it
it looks a little bit like the cover
effects illuminating setting powder
which I love that one definitely adds a
little bit more coverage purple is still
full on showing through with a different
foundation on underneath since I already
don't like my base right now but with a
different base I think this powder might
work for my skin I also really like this
packaging this is genius why has no one
else done this yet because it's always a
pain to tap it into your lid and then it
like spills over the edge you get a
friggin Bowl here so then to put it back
on this is the top so you just flip it
Wow good job flower beauty great product
design here this I am a little confused
by this is by Maybelline it's a brow gel
but it says tattoo studio waterproof
brow gel that supposed to last up to two
friggin days so I hope you like this cuz
it's gonna be on for a couple days maybe
this isn't a shade deep brown oh it
looks like very fiber e this is
interesting I'm gonna come out my brows
with this thing since they give it to me
it's nice that this wand is pretty small
I hate when brow products put giant-ass
wands on there so let's see oh wow wow
we're getting a lot of pigment here I'm
gonna wipe off some of this product as I
think I've way too much on here
see why they gave you a spoolie I'm
gonna spoil this out it's making me look
like I have a lot of brow hair wow I
almost need like an eyebrow brush cuz
there's so much product on there but I
need something to shape it with that
looks pretty nice oh I like the shade of
that I like what it did to the front of
my brows it made it look like I have a
ton of hair right there
the only thing is it dispenses a ton of
products so you have to wipe off that
applicator first and then I mean on my
brows it's kind of difficult to fill in
the shape with this wand if this stays
on two days I'll be a happy camper I am
filming this a few days in advance so
I'll take you guys in the description
box how this thing lasted okay even if
this thing doesn't last two days I would
use that again that was very quick easy
I don't have to go in with multiple
products I like that boo I'm excited all
right let's move on to a contour I'm
gonna try the LA girl just blush and
just because I hold this in the last
video there's something about the
packaging of this I really like the
shape and it just has a nice weight to
it
ooh this bends back nicely to love a
good packaging this looks like a very a
she kind of contour shade so just gonna
place this in the cheekbones heck yeah I
could see how this could easily look too
gray if you use too much product I'm
gonna try and use a lighter hand on this
side just dip in once see how it looks
oh yeah I have a whole video on my
favorite pale skin contours I like that
really nice cool tone shade if you have
fair skin I picked up a couple of new
bronzers mention this in the last haul
this is the makeup revolution bronze &amp;amp;
Glow has a highlighter and a bronzer
shade in there this one I picked up I
actually tried this yesterday this is
the luminous matte bronzing powder by
essence this is straight-up
orange on my skin tone even if you have
like a medium skin tone I mean this
thing looked friggin orange is looking a
lot better on my finger right now so out
pass on this for sure I'm gonna try this
makeup revolution guy this shade right
here it looks like a nice shade so I'm
use this as more like a bronzer might
bring this up on the temples we'll see
what I'm feeling
ooh feelin that not too warm not too
cool I like that you can also kind of
build this up don't want to bring this
up to the temples
hmm yeah let's do a little bit my eczema
right now it's like going all the way up
my arms I used the lawsuit lawsuit on
Locke suit on Locke seat on because I
said shea butter and that caused me to
like majorly flare-up so not gonna be
isn't that again
I like that bronzer just to kind of
blend everything together I've been
really liking doing this lately I'm
gonna take my same powder Physicians
Formula powder it's just kind of blends
and like fuses everything together just
go right over top and also like using it
right underneath just to kind of clean
up that line I feel like this shade
looked a lot different online this is
the metal chrome blush I was curious
about this because I really like a super
glowy luminous kind of blush but this
looks like gold dude this is like a gold
highlighter literally so maybe I was
like a blush topper if you have a deeper
skin tone or as a highlight if you have
a deeper skin tone but as a blush this
is definitely not gonna fly on my skin
have the new lumi glow nude palette by
l'oreal this is a highlighting palette
but there's a pink shade in here i kind
of want to see just what this looks like
that could work more as a glowy blush
I'm gonna use that I'm gonna try that it
might be too gluey but I'll just blend
some bronzer over top if it is that's
okay as a blush don't love it as a blush
don't hate it I'm just gonna dab a tiny
bit more of the bronzer shade I made an
espresso this espresso is supposed to
have notes of cereal in it it's no
Captain Crunch
okay now highlighters I have a lot of
highlighter options something I am so
excited about is essence brought back
there snowflake eyeshadow if you've been
watching my channel for a while you know
that the essence snowflake eyeshadow
single was one of my favorite
highlighters it is beautiful as a face
highlight and it's a couple bucks they
discontinued it and now they brought it
back to Ulta in different packaging I
think what essence did is you can
actually like pop these into one of
their palettes or something I kind of
want to try this because I'm curious if
this is the same as the other essence
one so I can continue to recommend it to
you guys or not I haven't like tweeted
or anything this is back because I
wanted to try it before I tell you guys
in case it is different still feels
really nice and soft it's such a pretty
pearly highlight but then I also have
like 5000
highlighters I really want to try the
elf heart coffee and cream highlighter
duo and then I also have this one which
I don't really feel like trying today
this is the Wet n Wild make a glow and
golden flower crown but then there's
also highlight and this thing do you
really want to use essence just so I
know if it to go or not so let's try
that
I might layer it with something else oh
yeah look and the same to me this is
such a pretty white pearly highlight if
you have fair skin love it good to know
is highly lately do you want to layer it
with the elf ones this one looks like
kind of a light pearly pink this might
be highlight overload today but ooh that
looks really pretty though it's pretty
similar actually maybe a tiny bit more
pink tone to it I keep looking at this
brow shade though I'm kind of in love
what does this feel like it's not sticky
nothing is coming off on my finger by
the way it almost does feel like those
things that you like lay down and then
peel off you're not supposed to peel
this off or you know it just says it
here's to browse for no hassle where
alright now that I have all the base on
I'm gonna share out this covergirl look
lock up
look lock up all day setting spray mmm
oh it smells like Jolly Ranchers in
perfume mixed wait this totally smells
like a perfume I have the smells almost
exactly like DKNY apple let's give him
my hand a really nice glow okay I'm
excited you could literally use this as
a body spray I wonder if it would give
them like my neck and shoulders a glow
let's try it's giving my neck a little
bit of a glow is this like a two-in-one
body spray and setting spray and glowing
spray let's try it on the face it feels
like it has a fine mister but mine is
like a little bit clogged or something
cuz there's one spot where I'm getting a
little bit more I feel like that just
did something I just want to keep spring
this on my face that might be the best
smelling setting spray that totally gave
me a glow hopefully that doesn't break
me out with the fragrance in there I
haven't used this in a while as a lid
primer but this is actually one of the
best eye shadow primers Maybelline is
2hr wine it's great because it gives you
some coverage on your lids and also
serves as a primer oh yeah a little
dizzy that's from all that perfume so
excited to try these these are the new
wet and wild eyes shadow palettes this
one is supposed to be like modern
renaissance kind of dupe and this one I
think they just did whatever they wanted
I kind of want to use both these
palettes and do like a warm red
cranberry kind of eye the wet wild color
icon palettes the eight pan ones are
great if you've never tried those those
are like one of those OG drugstore
products that I still recommend I still
use it's great I don't know if this is a
different formula but I really like the
layout of these and are nice and small
too if you want to travel with these if
you're wondering the back of the Kat Von
D brushes can also double as scissors
apparently wow this thing is on there
maybe not means if there's it's like
surgery I feel like I'm on Grey's
Anatomy right now well that was an
experience
they're both now open this bottom shade
right here there's some nice like
transition shades in here I'm gonna
actually start out with this light
purple shade right here and put that
into the crease now I'm gonna take this
shade because I cannot not on a little
bit smaller of a blending brush and put
that right below the purple shade into
the crease that shade is beautiful
blending out nicely so now in a flat
shader brush I'm gonna go with this like
magenta shade right here I'm just gonna
place this with the brush first and then
blend it out with my finger this is
pretty good color payoff for using with
a brush it's just hard to get colors
like this exactly where you want them
with your finger which is why I do this
step first okay and I'm gonna use my
finger this one feels a little bit
scratchy in the pan but it is pigmented
I'm not getting any fallout I need to
use a good blending brush with this one
so I'm gonna take the same shade on a br
250 Coastal Scents and just blend that
out those edges that shade when you
first put on and looks a little bit
patchy but it blends out easily so now
I'm gonna do the same thing on the other
eye I want to take this orange shade
right here just add that into the crease
those blend out a hella nice want a
little bit more
like warm Browns I'm gonna go with that
camel kind of transition shade again
right in there I'm getting no fallout
right now I'm going to take this deep
brown shade right here and we're gonna
blend that kind of into the outer third
bring it into the magenta well that's a
pretty brown and it out there's just
like melt together I might be in love
I'm gonna take a black waterline
eyeliner this is just the Maybelline
Gigi Hadid it works fine I like my la
girl glide on gel pencil the best that's
like my favorite waterline eyeliner I've
been able to find my la girl won lately
so I've just been using this flat edge
brush I'm gonna go back in with the dark
brown shade and run that along my lower
lash line I'm gonna push this right into
that black now to blend that out I think
I'm gonna take the orange shade actually
then we go back in with the brown since
some of I got lost I think I want to
keep the inner corner matte so I'm just
gonna take this light transition shade
right here oh wait there's a lighter
shade in this one I'm going to take this
matte shade wipe top that same brush I'm
just gonna put this right on inner
corner a little bit I'm thoroughly
impressed with these with the matte
shades that I used I think it's worth it
just for the matte shades I obviously
haven't tried the shimmers yet and I
think these around five or six bucks you
want these in your life I wanted to just
mascara just so I can give you guys a
little update since I mentioned this in
thing was a shadow inch mousse or
something this is a Maybelline total
temptation I don't love this one I find
that it makes my lashes very kind of not
clumpy just too much and they just kind
of like stick together but I'm just
gonna use a little bit to coat my lashes
I just wiped off a ton of product so it
doesn't clump but I just like to do this
before I apply false lashes like look at
that I didn't even use a lot and they're
clumping I don't know what happened I
went a little crazy with false lashes
but these are the new kiss lash Couture
faux mink lashes this one is in the
shade gala and these are like woah real
intense and then this one's in the style
I can never say this word
the doir and then this I'm pretty sure
as a blue that you guys have been
telling me to try for forever this is
the kiss latex-free strip lash adhesive
and clear so I'm going to try out this
glue to
- is one of those things I just kept
forgetting to pick up cannot remember
which side I found these on but these
are the new are Dell magnetic lashes I
think I want to do a whole other video
testing these filming is so crazy dude
I've been filming this video for three
hours so far and you guys are probably
at like the 15 minute mark if I'm doing
a good job editing this down so I think
I'm gonna go in with the food wah food
wah these lashes
boudoir isn't it French
no if I believe that let's try another
one
goood wah it's actually look pretty like
natural and wispy maybe I do want a
little bit more dramatic for this look
I'm gonna try the other ones I'm gonna
trim these I can see what they actually
might look like those are definitely
intense but I kind of want to do okay I
am loving these lashes for like a
dramatic lash obviously I like that
they're still tapered a little bit on
the inside and they don't feel - oh they
don't feel too like thick and heavy
first impressions of the lash glue works
fine my eyes aren't super Burney or
anything I didn't pick up a new lip
product but I want to give these things
a go again because some of the shades
look so nice I just haven't been into
the formula these in the past but I
think I'm going to layer the shade 62
charmer with a little bit of sixty tees
I love the applicator on here I just
found that these transfer to my teeth so
easily okay let's add a little bit of
that lighter shade ooh that actually
looks pretty I really like that shade I
hope this doesn't transfer like crazy
onto my teeth I love the shade of that
alright so this is the final look I feel
like we had some major winners I really
love these palettes I'm so excited to
use these some more for the price and
the quality these are bomb don't know
where the cap of this one but I'm
excited to use this again it's a nice
fair brightening shade under there
I like the coverage of it probably won't
reach for this again it just didn't do a
whole lot for Mandor eyes at all I am in
love with the shade of this thing and
everything even if this just washes off
tonight even if it doesn't last the two
days like they say I would definitely
use this again I like how it's kind of
like a two and one for me really like
the shade should I say that again I
really like the shade I don't feel like
this necessarily showed through my
foundation a lot so I might try mixing
this in with the foundation rather than
using it as a base and if I did use it
as a base I
keep it away from my poor area I would
use the settings breagan super excited
about the lighter shade of the instant
age rewind excited to use the flower
beauty powder again I love the packaging
of this I think it's genius and I do
like the glow that it gave I would use
this bronzer shade again really pretty I
would use the LA girl contour again both
of the highlights I have on the lashes I
like we had a lot of winners
what video today just film that we had a
 ton of duds oh the Amazon ads video
I did a full face using products that
Amazon recommended that I buy and like
the sponsor to add things on Amazon that
was a total they owe those products so
glad we have a lot of winners in this
one these definitely feel pretty sticky
to me so if you're not into that you
wouldn't like the formula of these they
are like a locker but I really like this
lighter shade so that is that I'm gonna
have everything link down below in the
