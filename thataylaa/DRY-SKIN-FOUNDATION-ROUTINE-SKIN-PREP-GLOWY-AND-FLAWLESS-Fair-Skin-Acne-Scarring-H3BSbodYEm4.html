talking about my dry skin foundation
routine that is a sentence I never
thought I was gonna be saying in my life
I've had an oily skin for about five
years at least more than that kinda was
normal before that then got super oily
and now that I'm on accutane I have dry
skin so it took me at least a few weeks
probably about a month to really nail
down a foundation routine that I love on
my skin right now for this video is for
dry skin folks if you have normal skin
you could also probably do this if you
have oily skin not for you have a bunch
of videos for you though
so this routine lasts really well for me
throughout the day it doesn't break down
it doesn't cling onto any of my dry
patches
it makes my forehead and everything look
great nice and plump doesn't settle into
my lines it's just an all over good
routine for me keep in mind that
everyone's skin is different so some
foundations that work for me might look
really bad on your skin and vice versa
this is just what I've been doing what's
been working really great for my skin if
you're new here I do foundation Friday
every single Friday on my channel I also
do a series called 15 days of foundation
I have tons like hundreds of foundation
videos at this point so I'll leave those
playlists linked down below in the
description box you can want to go and
watch any if you're excited for this
video don't forget to give it a thumbs
up so here we go here's what I've been
putting on my face in a routine that I
found just works great for my dry skin
alright so what I have found these past
few months having dry skin has been that
the way I prep my skin is literally
equally as important as the actual
foundation and products I'm using on top
of my skin your skin is super dry and
scaly and peely and just not plump and
moisturize enough than any product that
you put on top of it is probably not
gonna look the best I'm gonna be having
my full dry skin skin care routine
coming soon I don't know if this video
will be up first or that video I think
this video will be up first but I'm
gonna go in-depth about the actual
products I've been using so I'm just
gonna talk about a couple that I use to
prep my skin before makeup like it said
in this long sleeve so the first thing I
do after I wash my face with the CeraVe
hydrating cleanser I'll go in with
sometimes an aloe toner the Mario
Badescu one probably like half the time
I'll use that and then the other half
the time we'll just go straight in with
my moisturizer so to that I love for the
morning and for underneath makeup or the
CeraVe
moisturizing lotion I use this one most
often this one doesn't have SPF in it so
I'll use this if I'm using a foundation
that does have SPF in it this one just
absorbs really well into your skin I
applied this about 15 minutes ago and I
can feel it on my skin but it definitely
doesn't feel too slick or anything like
it feels like it's nicely absorbed in
there and I can put makeup on top of it
I really like that one and then if I
have a foundation that doesn't have an
SPF in it I'll go in with the elta MD
SPF 45 UV shield this is really nice and
lightweight for underneath makeup they
actually make a tinted version I always
kind of stay away from 10 and stuff
because usually the tint is way too dark
for my skin this is just a plain old
white version but I actually like it
because it kind of cancels out some of
the redness on my face this one I really
like can get this off Amazon my
dermatologist office also carries this
one so after I moisturize like I said
I'll let that kind of sit in for about
15 minutes ten to fifteen minutes I'll
drink some coffee do whatever but under
eyes have been drier than usual lately
so then I'll just put on this Sunday
Riley auto-correct brightening eye
contour cream whatever this is called I
really like this I mentioned this in the
new at Sephora video I really like this
because it has this light reflecting
thing in it that just really brightens
up your under eyes I'm just gonna tap it
in I know I'm not ring fingering it just
use a finger I don't know if I just went
in straight away with foundation right
now I don't think my skin would be quite
moisturize enough it looks way better
when I do this next step that's putting
some kind of hydrating mist or setting
spray on my face so the two that I've
been using you can see this one is
almost halfway down I've been using this
for about a month now I want to say a
month and a half maybe even two months
so the two that I'll kind of switch
between I've talked about this one for
forever but it's a two phase hangover 3
and one setting spray and primer spray
and then also the pixie hydrating milk
you missed this one has hyaluronic acid
in it one was basically exactly what it
says it's just a hydrating mist it's not
really gonna help with the longevity or
anything of your makeup this one I
definitely feel like is more of a
setting spray in that sense that it's
actually gonna set my help your makeup
stay on so I kind of just switch between
the two depending on what my skin feels
like that day and how long I want my
makeup last and everything but I'm gonna
use the Too Faced
hangover one today because this is what
I would do if I want my
to last longer so this spray gives you a
really pretty dewy glowy kind of look
again even if I'm not wearing makeup
I'll spray one of these on my face so
I'll give this thing a couple minutes to
kind of set down by the way I forgot to
mention if you're washing your face in
the morning or what I bring you do find
that you have certain dry patches you
can just use like a little exfoliant I
don't use it while I'm on accutane
because you're supposed to use like
gentle stuff on your skin but if you're
not on accutane you just have dry skin
then you can just use a little bit of an
exfoliant and try and get some of that
dead skin off also if I do have some dry
patches like I've been getting it a
little bit around this area I'll just
put a little bit of the jae-won jelly
pack on this is like glue so it almost
like presses the dry flakiness into your
skin just not quite as raised so when
you put makeup on top of it it's just
not as noticeable so I feel like this
has been helping in that situation so
with my skin right now I don't get oily
at all throughout the day it has been
pretty great going from having oily skin
and being like a total butter slick
stick stick of butter by the end of the
night you guys know even when I had oily
skin I really prefer the look of dewy
foundations because they just don't
emphasize the texture they look more
smoothing they just sit way better on my
skin personally they look less heavy
they look less cakey just tend to sit
better on the skin I find I did a whole
video on extreme coverage foundations
and most of those were dewy so if you
want to see kind of what my favourites
are in that category put it an eye over
here and down below I've heard from a
lot of you guys that is really hard to
find foundations for dry skin let me
know if you want to see a separate video
on the top foundations that I've found
so far because I do have a handful of
foundations and I'm not gonna mention
them all in this video this one that I'm
using today is just the one that I've
found works really well for me right now
and I've been reaching for it most but I
do have a handful of other foundations
that I think are really bomb on dry skin
but basically something that I look for
is a smoothing foundation dewy something
that's not going to cling to the dry
patches or anything so the best
foundation that I've found for that is
the dermablend smooth liquid camo so I
did a full review on this during one of
the 15 days Foundation series cream and
linen are the two lightest shades and
they're really similar there's like
barely any difference and both of them
are too dark and they have this weird
kind of orange yellow tint to it so I do
have to mix this solely because of the
shade if the shade was right I would
just wear this on its own this is such a
gorgeous foundation I feel like this is
totally underrated it is very
lightweight smoothing plumping even when
I had oily skin it didn't break down on
my skin throughout the day before head
did get oily by the end of the night but
you guys don't care about that you have
dry skin but with my skin now this just
looks stunning the whole day it lasts
amazing so this on its own I get about
light full coverage you can build this
up to full coverage just depending on
how much products you use and how you
apply it I would say it's a medium to
full coverage foundation on its own but
because of the shade I mix it with one
of three things and I'm gonna show you
guys the three foundations that I mix it
with actually at 4:33 I have four
foundations here the first two I would
use solely if I want to lighten it and
add more coverage so that's the laura
geller cover lock and then derma call
208 these two both have great coverage
they mix great with this one they just
add a lot more coverage to this and
lighten it if I just want to lighten it
and I'm not going for like an extreme
full coverage kind of look mix it with
either the lorac natural performance
foundation this I love I've been using
this ever since that first video I think
was the shadow in schmoozer first
impressions I use this in I really like
this it's bomb these two are actually
pretty similar so either mix it with
this one or the CYO lifeproof I've
mentioned 5000 times both of these are
great for dry skin on their own or mixed
in with stuff and they just have that
same kind of very skin-like plumping
look to them really flattering on any
dryness or texture I find so you totally
could use these two on its own as well
I'm giving away like a ton of the
foundations that I would mention in that
video so the combo that I love and the
one that we're gonna use today is the
dermablend mixed with the CYO if you
want to know how any of the four five
foundations I'm talking about perform
and look on their own have videos using
all of them you can always just search
the name of the product plus the Tayla
in the search bar on YouTube and any
videos I have using it will come up so
it makes my foundations I just use the
lid of the Bath and Body Works candle
works perfectly great and I just do
about one-third CYO two thirds
dermablend just to get the shade right
as far as brush versus sponge for
applications so far I'm finding that I
really prefer a spun
just because you're adding more moisture
back into your skin I'm gonna go ahead
and use the Eco tool sponge this thing
is so great did a whole video on it
I think I couldn't mix this one a little
bit lighter I ran out of my concoction
so I'm mixing a little bit more
so this is what the combo looks like on
its own right here I love the way it
sits on my forehead doesn't emphasize
any of my dryness around here or around
my nose so now I'm gonna go in for
concealer I found that the Maybelline
fit me works best for me right now
I use this shade 15 which is the
lightest not technically there's a shade
10 but 15 is lighter than 10 and like I
said in the sponge video I kind of just
let it chill there for about 30 seconds
before I go in and blend it out so now
I'm gonna go in and blend this out a
little bit if I'm feeling really lazy
I'll just go in with the same sponge I
use for my face but usually I like to
use a brush or or my finger I still use
the same under-eye powders that I always
use the two Physicians Formula One's I
just mixed these to get the right shade
and then I just press this under my eyes
just set everything so with the dry scan
the only place I like to set my face is
this area right here because that's
where I'm gonna be blending bronzer
blush and highlight on top of and if you
put that directly on foundation that
still has some tackiness to it it'll
just be really hard to blend out it'll
kind of stick it won't look totally
blended and good have tried various
powders on my skin when it's been dry
and it just does not look that it looks
so much better with just foundation on
if you can I would just avoid powder if
you're gonna use it just use it in
certain areas of your face all I do is
take the Laura Geller balance in
Brighton powder and I just put this
right on that area and I just Pat this
in I don't like blending because it kind
of blends away some of the foundation if
you do that this powder gives a really
really subtle glow but it's so beautiful
it doesn't look heavy on this skin
alright so I just quickly did my bronzer
blush and highlight for bronzer actually
all these are from Physicians formal I
use the butter bronzer in the shade
bronzer this is the darker shade like
way better than the lighter one then I
use the butter blush in rosy pink and
then for highlight I used the butter
highlighter this is the butter day in
pink so that's what's on my face so now
I'm gonna go in for setting spray I
usually do it after my eye shadow and
everything in brows too but just for the
sake of this video I'm gonna do it right
now so I'm gonna use the mist and fix
today I just found a new bottle so
that's exciting I'm gonna use this one
little test spray
oh it smells so bad but it works so good
so I lost a little clip of me talking
about this so I just wanted to add VIN
but this is one of my favorite settings
phrase I feel like it actually does
something great for dry skin great for
oily skin if you like a dewy finish but
I just really feel like this helps to
kind of settle everything and make your
face just look like skin so I'm gonna
let this dry down do the rest of my
makeup and I'll be right back alright so
the rest of my makeup is on I just did
basic use the dream Street tell it by
Kathleen lights I just went in with this
shade and then this tan shade this is
all I did for eye shadow for lashes I
use the pure jetsedder lashes one of my
favorites and then what else lipstick I
tried out the physician's form a healthy
lip velvet finished this is in the shade
red storeit 'iv effects and I kind of
wish I knew about this shade before I
just did the red lipsticks video because
this is such a beautiful wintery red
it's almost showing a brighter on camera
but it has that deep wintery look to it
the first time I'm wearing this formula
it takes a while to dry down it has a
little bit of not stick to it you can
just kind of feel it it's not
transferring on my teeth or anything it
does feel like it dried down it just
took a while to do that but this shade
is beautiful so I think I covered
everything this is pretty much what I've
been doing this is what my skin has been
looking like and I feel like this
routine just works really well for me so
