testing out this bad boy this is the
revealed smoky pellet launches December
11th and we're gonna be seeing if it's a
dupe for the urban decay naked smoky
palette which I did a whole review and
tutorial on as well I'll link it below
this is kind of an all-in-one video
comparison we did some swatch action I
kind of like this I feel like it's like
a tattoo or something I also showed you
guys this look half of my face is the
revealed palette and half of my face is
the naked smoky palette comment down
below right now and let me know which
side do you think is the urban decay
palette I'll give you a look let's get
into it shall we so I'm not gonna go in
too much depth about the urban decay
naked smoky palette because I do have a
whole review on this but this has 12
shades in it and it retails for $54 this
is the most expensive Naked palette so
far the packaging is on freakin point I
think the best thing about this palette
honestly is the packaging I think it's
beautiful it's super sturdy good for
traveling it has a magnetic closure on
the front this is the revealed smoky
palette by Coastal Scents they're
revealed 2 palette is one of my all-time
favorite eyeshadow palettes rate quality
super buttery formula super pigmented
and extremely reasonably priced for what
it is in my opinion I wasn't a fan of
the revealed 3 palette at all it was
chalky it was not my cup of tea this is
the revealed smoky palette so this is
their newest revealed palette this has
20 shades in it and it retails for 1995
but way more reasonably priced than the
Naked palette and you get almost double
the amount of shades every shade that
comes in the smoky palette they did a
dupe for in this palette so there's
dupes for every single shade and then
there's obviously some extra shades that
you don't get in the naked smoky palette
I'm just gonna go into the swatches now
so you guys can kind of see a comparison
of each shade in these swatches the left
shade is the Naked palette and then the
right shade is the revealed palette on
every single swatch you can see how
similar a lot of these are a couple of
shades the revealed palette is actually
a lot more pigmented and you just get
better color payoff
I do like the dark matte shades a lot
better in the reveal palette there a lot
more pigmented the only shades that I
think are better in the Naked palette
are the two light shades right here the
shade combat and 13 they're just a
little bit more pigmented in the Naked
palette packaging on the two I think
they did a pretty good job of making
this look beautiful as far as quality
The Naked palette is obviously a better
quality this one is cardboard there's no
mirror on the inside it's just the
revealed smoky design which I really
love I love the smoky like marbled
effect the stars quality the urban decay
definitely it takes the cake on that
category so I'm gonna go in and show you
guys how I did this look make sure you
cast your votes down below for which
side you think is which I think they
look pretty frickin identical so if you
want to see how I got this look very
pleased if you watch
all right so we're gonna do one side
revealed palette one side naked smoky
palette so the right side of my face is
gonna be the revealed palette and then
the left side is gonna be naked smoky
I've only put a couple of these shades
on my eyes so far and i've swatched them
and they feel beautiful
I'm just priming the eyes with Mac's
painterly paint-pot or no what is this
soft ochre we're also gonna run it on
the bottom lash line a little bit
because we're gonna be putting eyeshadow
there so I'm going to start out with a
transition shade to put in the crease
both of these have a nice topi kind of
light tan color that we're gonna use so
going in with the revealed smoky palette
my right eye I'm going in with combust
from the Urban Decay palette combust
it's definitely a little more pigmented
she's gonna go in a little bit more to
see if we can deepen it up a little
there reveals smoky palette actually has
two different shades of dark purples
they look pretty freakin similar this
one looks like it has a little bit more
like red tone warm tones in it this
one's a little bit more cool toned i
swatched the two purple shades next to
each other from both palettes and they
look almost identical so that's good
news I'm gonna go in with this Real
Techniques little eye brush that I
actually really like this is from their
holiday set base shadow brush let's just
blend up we're gonna be blending all the
edges so don't worry looks a lot less
purple when it's actually on your eye
which I feel like usually happens with
purple shadows alright going in with
naked smokey smolder this one definitely
has a little bit more like reflective
mist to it when they're on your eye they
look pretty dang similar I'm just gonna
go in with an empty blending brush and
kind of blend those edges a little bit
same brush and go in with the black
shades in each palette is to define the
crease a little bit these are all
blending out really easily so far on
both eye both eyes we have two
I'm going to go in with the dark matte
gray shade in each palette there's no
names on the revealed palette I'm just
blaming this on the outer third I don't
want to bring this all the way in there
we go now going in with password from
The Naked palette I'm gonna put some
like light shiny color on the lid but
I'm debating whether I want to do this
topi glittery shade or the like rose
gold shade right here so I'm gonna take
a lip brush that we can wet I think
first I just want to see what it looks
like dry and then we'll probably add a
little bit of setting spray to make it
more intense I'm just packing in the
revealed shade on the brush and I'm just
gonna place this right on the center of
the eye this will just help give a
little bit of dimension it's actually
really appreciate I'm getting a lot of
fallout with that one this one looks
like it has a little bit more glitter in
it super similar do you want a little
bit more of a metallic look so I'm gonna
go in with my setting spray and just do
that again but wet the brush I actually
think I like the way that this one
applies wet better I'm gonna wet the
brush again and go in with that light
rose gold shade I'm just gonna put this
on the very inner corner on the bottom
those look identical both the shades
look exactly the same as far as fallout
it looks like the right side of my face
the reveal palette has a little bit more
fallout I think that was just from that
silvery gray shade it's not really any
fallout on the urban decay side right so
that's everything for shadows I'm gonna
apply the rest of my makeup and I will
be right back alright so this is what it
looks like with my full face on I think
they look pretty identical what do you
guys think I like to the revealed
palette just as much as the Urban Decay
Naked if not more after watching the
revealed palette there are definitely a
few shades in here that I
like better than the naked palette for
$20 vs. 54 I think you guys could
definitely just go with the revealed
smokey palette I love my revealed 2
palette and I think this one is gonna be
a new favorite I'm not sure when this
video will be going up but I'll leave a
link to the palette down below if you
want to purchase it yourself if you guys
like this and you like the kind of
comparison swatch videos give it a
thumbs up so I know love you guys thanks
for watching and see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
