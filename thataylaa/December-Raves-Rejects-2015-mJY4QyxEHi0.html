hope you guys noticed a difference right
now because we are on a new camera this
is the Canon 70d autofocus hallelujah I
also got a new mic but I didn't want to
put it on today because this is the
first time I'm using this camera and
baby steps you know I'm saying the
camera is very far away for me because I
have a that's 1.8 lens it's what you
call it you actually have to be like
three or four feet away from the camera
so I hope you guys can hear me okay for
this video I will get the mic figured
out after this let me know what you guys
think the color looks so much better
than my old camera already in the
viewfinder it looks like the white
balance is right watch this there's
autofocus look at that amazing I do have
one other video that was filmed on my
old camera scheduled to go up so the
quality might be going back and forth
for a little bit but soon all of my
videos will be filmed on this bad boy so
today we have December raves and rejects
we're not going to talk about how fast
December went by because I'm going to be
having a 2015 favorites video and we can
talk about how fast time flies in that
video so I'm just going to get into it
if you're new to my channel I do race
and rejects videos every single month so
the first thing I wanna mention is this
elf foundation brush this has been my
favorite brush this month I've pretty
much been using this what would that
sentence just didn't happen I've pretty
much been using this every single day
this one with the foundation I'm about
to mention next for six dollars or
whatever this is you can't go wrong this
is such a great foundation brush has
just the right amount of stiffness to it
and the bristles are really compact so
you do get really full coverage when
using this brush Sigma f80 is still my
holy grail foundation brush but for 6
bucks this is a really good second place
I just want to show you guys everything
up close now because I can there we go
whoa that's never gonna get old hope you
have enough battery left and then you've
charged the battery all the way because
I got too excited and wanted to film the
foundation I've been using this with and
I was hesitant to mention this in
video just because I don't know when my
review on this is going up it should be
up before this video a 99% sure of my
review on the Marc Jacobs remarkable
foundation will be up before this I'll
link it in the description box below
I've been wearing this for about three
weeks now every single day with this
brush it is amazing this is the shade 10
I mix this with the shade 12 which
you'll see in that video I'm not gonna
go in too much depth about this because
like I said it you have a whole video on
it but if you're looking for a good full
coverage long-lasting foundation that is
in a beautiful bottle look no further by
the way I'm not wearing the remarkable
foundation right now because I'm testing
out the Maybelline and dream velvet
foundation to review how do you guys
think it looks it's a little less
coverage than I like but its hold enough
pretty well looking a little bit oily
okay my favorite highlight this month
has been this combination this is the
Sigma fo3 high cheekbone brush and this
is the city color highlight trio in the
lightest shade collection one very
original name this is like six bucks for
three shades of highlight this is one of
the new Sigma brushes and it is the
perfect size for a cheekbone highlight
I've been using this every single day I
can't get enough of it it just places
the product so well you don't have to
think about it if you're looking for a
good highlight brush this is your guy I
do have a 10% off the sigma code which
I'll link in the description box down
below but onto this bad boy this is the
city color highlight thing like I said
trio there we go
this basically has a gold champagne
white shade and then a light pink shade
right here let's see how this works is
the brightness too much it might be bare
with me while I figure out this camera
so I haven't been using the gold shade
too much just because it doesn't work
very well for my skin tone but these two
shades right here oh no the batteries
lodging I've been using these two
shades mostly the middle shade these are
so freakin pretty but they reflect the
light beautifully they're not chalky and
for six dollars these are a steal I
tried out some julep maven products this
month this tan polish which I posted on
my Instagram with like the Milani silver
sparkles on it
has been my favorite polish this month
it's so hard to find a tan color that
doesn't look really off on pale skin
this one I think works does it make you
look like you have jaundice or anything
this is in the shade Florence and I love
the formula of jewel it polishes I'm
wearing another one right now this is
it's like a really DNA what is the name
it's like Darrell or something I'll
leave it down below and then also the
julep glycolic like glycolic glycolic
hand scrub I have never been into hand
scrubs this is basically a combo of
exfoliating apricot seeds plus glycolic
acid it's gentle enough that you can use
it every single day on your hands it's
not gonna like strip your hands the
glycolic acid it has such a nice scent
and it just makes your hands feel so
soft it's not even like using a lotion
or a hand soap your hands just feel like
baby soft the scent is really nice it's
like a floral scent with a little bit of
citrus in there think this is on sale
for like seven dollars right now on
their website and it's normally in the
$20 range so and now is the time to try
it if you're interested my favorite
blush and brush this month has been the
Real Techniques multitask brush with the
Oprah cosmetics pink satin blush use
this in my New Year's Eve tutorial I've
been wearing this every single day
except today because I'm trying out the
Maybelline master contour or whatever
this is that's what I'm wearing if
you're wondering on my bronzer blush and
highlight today it's this which I really
like but anyways back to Ofra pink side
perfect pink blush thing I love about
their blushes is that they blend out so
easily have the perfect amount of
pigment where it's really difficult to
over blush your face but you're not
gonna be spending forever applying blush
I literally just dip my brush in here
twice and go to town and this brush with
it is like my new favorite blush brush
this was in their holiday collection I'm
not sure if they sell this brush by
itself I'll link it down below if they
do on Amazon I asked you guys in the New
Year's Eve video if you want to see a
favorite brush video a lot of you said
you did so we're going to be doing that
coming up soon I have a new favorite
eyebrow product in my life if you saw my
Korean beauty haul video this was
there this is the etude house called
drawing eyebrow
this isn't shade zero six black it's not
actually black it's a dark brown shade
and it's actually the perfect shade for
my eyebrows it has it's fully on one end
and then it has this planted thing on
the other end better you just died I
charged it for about 20 minutes so
hopefully we're good and that time I
also ordered a spare battery on the
Amazon if you do YouTube you know that
waiting for a battery to charge is like
watching paint dry
um I think we were talking about this I
can do my brows in about one minute now
during the day just when I'm going to
work or doing whatever I go in with this
first and create the shape it has this
angled point right here so it's really
easy to make the shape that you want I
go in with this and then my ultra brow
gel and it's just the perfect amount of
shape but still looks natural here's a
close-up because I can this is just like
a whole new world what else so I have
totally been on a face mask kick lately
I'm gonna few guys want to see a whole
video dedicated to my favorite face mask
but I have a very bad addiction right
now I think I'm about 30 face mass in
our closet right now these are two of my
favorites this month the first one is
the Fremen mint and lemon clay mask
this is gonna be mentioned in a
drugstore haul actually going up after
this video but I filmed that video
almost three or four weeks ago it just
hasn't gone up yet so if you see that in
this in that video
I've already been trying it out for a
few weeks this is supposed to control
oil and breakouts I love the smell of
this it smells lemony but super
refreshing not too sweet when you put it
on it has this really pretty like
tiffany blue color which you've probably
seen if you follow me on snapchat so
this is for people who have acne prone
or oily skin I don't know if it's
necessarily helping my acne I do feel
like it helps to control my oil my skin
feels super clean afterwards it dries
fairly fast in about 10 minutes it
doesn't tell you how long to leave it on
but I usually try and leave my face mask
on as long as possible as you do it
while I'm editing or something so I
usually leave it on for about 45 minutes
I put a dent in this already for even
masks are super affordable I think this
is around $4 from CBS next mask is the
derma e purifying two-in-one charcoal
mask
this has marine algae with activated
charcoal purges pores of deeply-rooted
stalks
this is just a really nice fast drying
charcoal mask is this a good mask if
you're in a rush or you're traveling and
your skin is not doing so hot dry super
fast
it definitely it feels like it's an oil
controlling mask a good way it doesn't
feel like it's stripping your skin of
anything but it feels very what's the
right word
just like dries up the right spots I
guess I wouldn't use this if you have
dry skin next product you also see in
that same haul video that I've been
using for a few weeks now this is the
Mario Badescu drying lotion I don't know
why I haven't picked this up until now
I've heard everyone rave about this
product I have their buffering lotion I
think it's called this is specifically
for acne
you basically just dip a q-tip in there
get some of the pink sediment at the
bottom and then you put it directly on
your acne and sleep with it on overnight
this stuff freakin works if you're
breaking out and you need something to
help control the acne and just dry it
out this is great I think it's around
$17 you can get out Ulta my acne has
been majorly going in and out this month
had a couple good weeks than a couple
horrible breakout weeks I think it's a
mix of my hormones and then just trying
out tons of new foundations and my skin
is kind of freaking out next day for the
month is the sweet eyelash by lip fly
this is a asian beauty product you're
not sure if it's Korean or Japanese was
in the hall as well if you like
seperated doll-like lashes I'm wearing
them right now these are perfect I'll
show you a close-up look at you can see
things so that's these lashes these are
super reasonable I think this was about
under $7 for 5 pairs like it him okay my
last rave of the month is the Lanisha
lip sleeping mask I've never tried a lip
mask before it basically functions
exactly the same as a thick lip balm at
least this one does the packaging of
this is beautiful look at this pink
hombre I think it's so pretty it's
basically a thick lip balm I've been
using it every single night when I go to
sleep this is what the consistency looks
like I noticed a difference in my lips
when I wake up and I'm not using this
stuff now it is very moisturizing my
favorite thing about this is the smell I
really like minty smelling lip balms I'm
not used
like a sweet candy scented kind of
person but this has like the faintest
smell of strawberry or bubblegum or
something you actually have to like
sniff in kind of when you're putting it
on to smell it
it's super faint which I like it's not
overpowering I actually have a decent
amount of rejects this month I've been
collecting these in a drawer because it
was like the month of rejects like I
said I've been on a mass kick this month
I have two that i am not a fan of at all
versus this beauty 360 detoxifying
purifying a facial mask this is by far
the shittiest mask I've ever put on my
face I feel like they literally packaged
colored gel and just called it a face
mask it does nothing absolutely nothing
it doesn't really dry literally just
wipe on a gel chill there for 20 minutes
wash it off and your face feels exactly
the same definitely gonna be returning
this this was horrible I do not
recommend it next is the nip and fab
glycolic instant fix skin mask this was
pretty pricey I think this was around
$13 it says it has like colic acid
reduce the look of pores blah blah this
just didn't do anything for me either
for such a tiny amount of product and
for it being so expensive it's just not
worth it to me a formula is also very
gel like next reject is this Sonia
Kashuk chic luminosity glow powder I was
so excited to find a white powder that
claims it's a glow powder I was thinking
this was kind of gonna kind of be like
the math crap what is this called
basically like an under-eye powder that
has a little bit of luminosity to it I
can tell by the finish this wasn't gonna
be like a highlighter I thought this
could be good for pale skin it is chalky
it doesn't do anything so it has this
like snake kind of finish on it and when
you swatch it look at that like
literally barely anything comes off it
is super chalky just literally it
disappears next to have proof 10 eye
primer this was from etude house I think
it doesn't say I'm here it might be it
might not be
the thing I really didn't like about
this is that it actually wiped off my
concealer on my eyes super weird
I thought it was just a weird thing that
happened the first time I tried it with
a different concealer it did the same
thing basically like completely wipes
off all product on your eye
I like the coverage that my concealer
gets on my eyelid before I put on a
shadow I feel like it's a nice base
so to completely wipe it off just
doesn't doesn't do it for me next is
this Bobbi Brown brush don't ask me why
I bought this like do I need another
eyebrow brush no I got this from Sephora
I don't have any Bobby Brown brushes and
I figured I would try it out this was
pretty horrible this is our eyebrow
brush the bristles are feel like horse
hair first of all super not soft the
thing I really don't like is that
there's way too many bristles at the tip
where it just kind of starts fraying out
so if you guys can see that I've only
used it about two times and it's already
starting to fray out right here look
they're right there it's way too thick
for brows you can't get any kind of
shape going and for being an expensive
brush that's just did not make the cut
alright so that was everything I think
we're actually gonna make it through on
this battery like always all the
products I mentioned will be listed in
description box below if you want to
shop if you are shopping online go
through eBay so you can save money every
single time this is not sponsored by you
mates I just use it every time I shop
online I save a ton of money I'll
leave a link for e-base down below I
think they give you like a free $10 gift
card or $15 gift card when you sign up
you guys like rates and rejects videos

you give this a thumbs up so I know if
you're excited for end-of-the-year
