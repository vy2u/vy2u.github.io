today we have December race and rejects
don't ask me how December is over
because have no clue I have a
decent amount of products this month and
I'm super stoked about December I like
nailed down a good foundation routine so
what's on my face right now I have a
whole video on it so I'll link it over
here I also have an eye tutorial on the
look I'm wearing right now everything's
in the downbar so let's just start off
with face products I'm not gonna mention
all of the products I'm using on my face
since there is a whole video on that but
all those products are favorites this
month combined they're just amazing I'm
gonna start out with two face products
the first is the NARS radiant creamy
concealer I feel like I've heard about
this thing for like years but I just
never picked it up because I think it's
like thirty dollars it's pretty freakin
pricey for a concealer I finally picked
this up because I was tired of mixing
products in to make the concealer
lighter for my skin tone asked you guys
on Twitter what your favorite concealers
are for pale skin and a bunch of you
said artist Chantilly this stuff is
amazeballs I feel like this is literally
the perfect concealer and just be clear
I put this only under my eyes I don't
normally like spot conceal because I
normally wear a full coverage foundation
and that just covers it I do use this
for under my eyes it does increase it
looks amazing all day long super
brightening everything about this
concealer is perfect and it's worth the
money and you need to buy it so next
face product has been a favor is the
Laura Geller balance and brightening
powder in porcelain this powder gives
the prettiest finish ever it makes your
skin look so much more natural it gives
you like the prettiest glow and it still
has coverage which is what I really like
about it I've also had this powder for a
solid year and I'm just now starting to
like dent the dome I got this off of hot
look they put it on hot like I feel like
every couple months be on the lookout my
favorite powder brush lately has been
the Eco tools huge ass brush I'm not
sure what this is technically called but
I will find it and I will put
down below this is just a super-dense
kabuki powder brush
I totally somehow messed up my ELF
powder brush when I washed it was weird
things going on on it so I found this in
my drawer and I decided to give it a go
and I've been using it every single day
Ecotools brushes are super affordable
you can get them at Ulta and I think
Walgreens carries them my next makeup
item is super random this is I don't
even know how you say this oh Sh I glow
on shimmer light this is a liquid
illuminator this came in one of the Mimi
boxes and I was not expecting this to be
that pretty but it totally looks like
benefit high beam I know if you guys can
see it a little bit better that way I
love this stuff for just running a tiny
bit down the bridge of my nose and on my
cheekbones just gonna do a super pretty
glow it is kind of weird though because
this came but really half empty which is
kind of odd I don't know my last kind of
makeup item this month is the L'Oreal
infallible spray if you've seen any of
my videos lately you probably knew this
was coming this is a makeup setting
spray from the drugstore I first
mentioned this in my drugstore haul
video and said this is the first
drugstore setting spray and a bunch of
you guys freaked out is that there's NYX
and there's ELF and there's all these
things I don't know why but NYX in my
mind isn't really a drugstore brand they
just recently came in the drugstores I
don't know personally I consider this
the first like actual true drugstore
makeup setting spray it is pretty pricey
this retails for $16 surround me I got
on sale for 12 and I wish I stocked up
because now it's on sale helps your
makeup stay on way longer just sets the
powder and the foundation and everything
into your face I think this works just
as well as my skin maybe a setting spray
and you save 10 plus dollars next I have
a few skincare items I think I'm going
to be making like an acne update video
just what I've been using he's on my
deeper life of youtuber tag my skin was
horrible in that video that was like a
few weeks ago now my time like when I'm
filming this and as you can see I still
have like a couple zits here and there
but they are starting to majorly go down
my chin is like pretty clear right now
which is rare I don't think my chin has
been clear for months
I honestly think that's due to a
combination of things
using a couple face products which I'll
mention later switched up my foundation
routine to products that I know do not
break me out and I've added a couple
really awesome products into my skincare
routine that I think have tremendously
helped so Mario Badescu sent me a bunch
of acne stuff to try out and see if it
worked I'm not getting paid to mention
any of these like always I do not have
to come on here and say anything about
these products and mentioning them
because they're kick-ass these two are
amazing so this is the Mario Badescu
buffering lotion I've heard a lot of
people talk about the drying lotion it's
interesting that they call it lotion
because it's like a full and liquid like
you put on your face and like drips down
this is a spot treatment says it's
supposed to target deep cystic blemishes
and large clusters of acne so that is
exactly what I have
it smells like straight-up alcohol like
I'm pretty sure I looked at this and
there was yeah the second ingredient is
alcohol and you can smell that so if
you're really sensitive to smells either
suck it up or don't put this on your
face but basically after I do my entire
face routine at night this is my last
step and I basically just like put my
head back and drop a few drops and then
kind of rub it in with my finger on all
of my acne spots I put it mostly on my
chin and then down my neck because I do
have a couple spots down here this does
such an amazing job of drying out your
acne I've been using this for probably
three weeks now and when I wake up in
the morning my acne it just is so much
better this is amazing the second
product from them that I wanted to
mention is the hyaluronic I cream
hyaluronic acid is really good for anti
aging a lot of the Polish choice
products have that in it this is just an
eye cream I have never found an eye
cream that I felt like was actually did
the things that I wanted to I cream is
something that I've kind of been trying
to find a good one for a while I don't
really have dark under eyes I just want
to keep my under eyes moisturize to
prevent wrinkles and all that good stuff
this stuff does the job when I wake up
in the morning my under eyes feel so
much more moisturize and I just feel
like it's actually doing something
smells good just smells fresh so let's
kinda like c2fo liking this stuff my
last face kind of product is super
random this is a Sephora brand brush
which looks kind of fun
right now and the pain is like chipping
off I was like walking out of Sephora
when I saw this thing and you know those
brushes that you just feel like you have
to touch this was literally the softest
brush that I had ever felt in my life I
think this was only like nine between
nine and twelve dollars and at first I
thought it was a powder brush and then I
read the package and it's actually an
exfoliating brush like for the shower I
think you could totally use this wet or
just as a powder brush I've been using
this in the shower time interesting that
the paint's coming off because I feel
like if you're supposed to use it in the
shower then they would have made like
kind a better situation going on right
here but basically I just use my bar of
like antibacterial soap stuff and then
I'll just rub it around in circular
motions all over my face I don't know
why they call it exfoliating because
it's like the most gentle brush you
could ever use on your face it literally
just feels so good I really like this
thing again I'm sure you could use this
as a powder brush as well I just thought
this was unique and I've never seen
anyone talk about this and I didn't even
know this thing existed so my last rave
of the month is the Clairol hair food
honey
apricot hair mask this came and I think
the fabfitfun box and first like the
packaging like packaging to me is really
phidias like this does not make me want
to put it on it almost looks like too
organic and for me and I'm usually
not about the apricot smell at all but
this smells so good just smells like a
really good hair product kind of has
some like Pantene and coconut going on
in here this is a paraben free and
mineral oil free hair mask so basically
I just put this on in the shower after
my conditioner as I'm like shaving my
legs or whatever like that happens that
maybe happens like once every two week I
just let it sit in my hair I forgot
three to five minutes and then I rinse
it out and my hair just smells so good
and feels so good I think that you can
get this at Target right so you have a
few rejects this month
I know shocker I actually remember it
rejects some months I just don't have
any products I really didn't like but
this was not one of those months so the
first reject is the sunset stripped gold
lipstick by wet miles I think I
mentioned this in a drugstore haul video
alike as you can see this is just like
the shittiest gold I've ever seen in my
life
I wouldn't even layer this on top of
something because it's so sheer and just
reminds me of like gold mixed with like
diarrhea throw that in the trash the
next reject of the month which is so
hard for me to say because I love this
product it is the benefit Porefessional
and this is a reject because like I
mentioned earlier I am pretty sure that
this caused my skin like my skin was bad
before I started using this but this I
feel like took it to the next level I
don't really think this was always
causing my breakouts until my roommate
who I also got to use this stopped using
it and her skin was starting to clearing
up too I've heard from a lot of you guys
that this broke you out as well if you
bought this because of me and it broke
you out I apologize again if you don't
have sensitive skin and you don't have
acne prone skin this should be fine for
you but this is an amazing product and
amazing primer and I wish I could keep
using it because it actually works but
yeah my skin just really doesn't like
this at all this is the Neutrogena
ageless intensives deep wrinkle eye
cream I just feel like this literally
does nothing
I ordered this off of Amazon back when I
was doing like the eye cream search
there's nothing like extremely horrible
about it and there's nothing good about
it either not worth your money and I
would not recommend buying this the end
all right so that was all of my December
raves and rejects for the month let me
know down below what your favorite
products for this month so I can try
them out if you liked this video and you

heck is it 2015 I wish you all a Happy
New Year let me know down below what
