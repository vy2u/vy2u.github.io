happy late bladed Hanukkah to all you
fellow Jews out there how do you do that
wink I'm not quite sure it's a lot of
freaking coordination I know it's been a
while for a race and rejects video don't
kill me
we're doing it now these are all the
products that I liked and didn't like in
the month of December / November because
it didn't do a video for that month I'm
going to start out with foundation I've
been getting a lot of questions on my
Instagram about the foundation and
powder I've been wearing I can't give
you an answer for that because honestly
I switch it up everyday but there is one
foundation that I always reach for and
that is the Kat Von D lock-it tattoo
foundation and this is in the shade l42
maybe it's the lightest shade they make
go figure but it actually is a little
bit too light for me I find that it
makes me look like a freaking ghost if I
wear it alone and I'm not a huge fan of
the completely matte finish so I usually
will mix this with the maybelline
superstay foundation and that is my like
go-to foundation combo lately absolutely
love this it's super long-lasting
mattifying great if you have oily skin
super super full coverage or a super
full coverage love it it's totally worth
the money oh the powder I've been using
is the Mac Studio Fix powder to be
completely honest I was never really a
fan of this because I remember this was
my first like Mac face product I tried
when I was in like eighth grade or
freshman year of high school or
something and the lady completely
color-matched me wrong and you know when
you just like associate bad memories
with things even though it's probably
not even a thing it's just like the
situation does that make sense
anyways I finally got my right color in
this which is nw15 and I've been using
this powder lately with the Kat Von D
foundation and the maybelline superstay
I love it I gotta say
it does apply way better whoa where to
go with a sponge like this don't use the
sponge that it comes with it's not going
to work as well this is the NYX
professional powder puff or something
like that when you apply it with the
powder it just gives you a much more
flawless finish and wearing all the face
products I mentioned right now next
product I have been obsessing over I
don't know why but I've been on this
like highlighter kick lately I just love
the look of dewy highlighted kind of
skin I'm wearing it right now I don't
know if the light is showing it as well
as it does in real life but it is the
mary lou manizer highlighter by the balm
I've had this for a while now and it
doesn't even look like it but I use it
pretty much every day trying to figure
out the whole focus zoom thing on this
camera but it is just a gorgeous
highlighter you can get the balm on
HauteLook out look hot look whatever
it's called did this every time it's a
flash sale site the link will be down
below and I think I got it for like $14
on there and it's normally like
20-something so check it out last face
product that has been a rave for me it
is the L'Oreal magic Lumi light infusing
primer holy balls can't say enough
amazing stuff about this primer I've
always been a Maybelline instant age
rewind girl as far as primers go and
then I tried this in the world was
changed I think part of the reason why I
love it is the packaging it's got some
rose gold going on it has a pump I
always love a pump since it's a light
infusing primer it does give you a kind
of glow when you put it on I can't say
that I noticed a difference in like the
doing this once I apply a foundation
over it but I've got to say it
definitely helps my foundation lasts
longer the only thing is this smells
like absolute it smells like a
mixture of carrots and chemicals in a
bottle not a fan of the smell at all but
it makes up for it in the product so the
next two raves are eye products the
first is kind of in general right here
morphe brushes eyeshadows leave their
link down below but I found them from
Instagram and not heard really good
things about them and I decided to order
some of their pan i shadow z' which are
right here these four and there are $2
like what the just as good if not
better than the mac eyeshadows they're
so pigmented this one looks dark in the
pan but when you put it on your eyes
it's definitely comparable to mac soft
brows gorgeous colors
I have other colors from them but these
are just my most used so I keep them in
my mini Z palette the colors will be
down below because I have to double
check on the website don't know it off
the top of my head no killings eye
product is the next pearl ultra mania
was that right ultra pearl mania and it
doesn't say the color but it is the
white pearl shade is very comparable to
the Mac vanilla pigment which I
absolutely love for under the brow bone
and even on the cheek bone as a
highlight you can use these wet or dry I
think they're like 2 or 3 dollars you
can get it off
cherry culture calm or next website so
super good for highlighting the inner
corner of the eye love it the last
couple things are lip products the first
is the Rimmel Kate Moss lipstick in 0-8
is a neutral berry color so freaking
pretty if you follow my Instagram you've
definitely seen me wearing it it's just
one of those colors that you can put on
your lips wherever you're going it looks
like your lips but better just looking
at the lipstick in the case it's
probably not a shade that I would ever
pick out for myself I don't know what
prompted me to buy it but I did it is
just gorgeous on the lips especially for
fall and winter so give that a try you
can get it at CVS or rite-aid yeah just
about like Harry Potter birthday the
last two raves for the month is the Mac
current lip pencil which is like a berry
color and you compare this with rebel
and it's gorgeous
or when whoa it's like rolling all over
the place or when while
9:08 see lipstick which is like a deep
berry color can't go wrong with like a
dollar ninety-nine lipstick you know
it's a winner these are a little bit
drying though so be careful with that
definitely put them moisturized
chopstick something underneath your lips
or primer so it doesn't look dress so
now on for the rejects of the bunch
so unfortunately both of these are NYX
products
I love NYX but these two just aren't
cutting it I ordered a shipment of NYX
on their Cyber Monday sale and
everything was 50% off and free shipping
so I was like even if I don't like
something then it won't really be a
waste of money I don't know that was my
justification let's start out with the
next a matte but not flat liquid
foundation it is like a cream foundation
I'm just not a fan of the finish at all
I like it a little bit if I mix it in
with my maybelline superstay I've got
some like you know Sahara desert regions
going on on my face right now during the
winter time and this just clings to all
those like no other I know it is a
mattifying foundation so I might like it
better in the summer and I am going to
keep it for the summer time because it
also is a little bit too dark this is
the shade 0-3 natural it's definitely
about three shades darker than my skin
tone which is also why I mix it with the
maybelline superstay but reading the
description on the website they made it
seem they called this ivory with pink
undertones which to me is ivory for
people with pink undertones my mind I
was picturing like an nw15 which is
ivory with pink undertones but no this
is color is literally like an NC
25 Mac if that gives you a picture of
how damn dark this foundation is so I
may keep it to wear with self-tanner
but right now it's making me look like
someone from jersey shore class reject
is the NYX
above-and-beyond full coverage concealer
and this is
the concealer in a jar and zero one
porcelain of super-excited Titus because
I feel like I've heard good things about
this and the NYX HD concealer but for
some reason the concealer with like a
wand is like the most unappealing
concealer to me in the world I usually
love the potted kind not this one feels
like a Paint Pot after it's been drying
for like two years
it is not creamy at all once you do kind
of warm it up with your fingers and get
it to the consistency where it's ready
to be put on your face once you put it
on your face
there's no blending whatsoever it's like
you have to literally Pat it on and it
looks weird and like strokey it looks so
bad I were to work the other day had a
concealer crisis mid-shift
literally had to like take off and redo
my whole concealer because it looks so
horrible it was settling in all the fine
lines I had the mascara lens underneath
it looked like I put it on like blind at
4:00 in the morning comment down below
if you have tried this concealer and you
like it and there's a better way to
apply it that I'm just missing out on
because this is a giant reject so that
was my no member December NYX of the
Raven reject video thumbs up if you like
