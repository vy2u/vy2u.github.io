foundation application alright so today
it's foundation Friday so I try out a
new foundation every single Friday on my
channel what are my hands doing right
now I feel like I'm like holding staples
ready to go on some moguls playlist is
linked down below in the description box
if you're new here you can go back and
watch other foundation videos this is
the brand-new huda beauty faux filter
foundation they've been teasing this for
a while like this has been a long time
coming for this foundation retails for
$40 you get one point one eight fluid
ounces of product which is a little bit
more than the standard one fluid ounce
the thing that is amazeballs about this
foundation is the shade range this comes
in 30 shades I do want to give major
props to who do Beauty I tweeted this
the other day but check out this picture
of their shade range can we get a hell
yeah for this photo even though I
absolutely despise the fenty Beauty
foundation between that lunch and this
it has been freaking refreshing that
there are a couple brands that have come
out in the last few months with balm
shade ranges even though there's still a
long way to go and other brands
definitely need to still step it up in
the shade range game things are changing
for the better if you have very deep
skin or very fair skin at least there
are some options now so I picked up two
shades on Sephora which I'll talk more
about that process in a minute but I
picked up vanilla 120-b and shortbread
200 B I had absolutely no idea what
shade I was gonna be typically I am the
lightest or second to lightest shade of
foundation but under the fair category
for this foundation there were six
shades which is amazing that never
happens now I know how old the medium
tone people feel when you have like ten
shades every time you choose for him
listen folks that is a good problem to
have but then I came across this chart
which was on the hooter Beauty website
and based on this comparison the second
two lightest shade is the elf 41 in Kat
Von D which elf 42 is way too light for
me it looks like Ghostly on my skin they
ordered this online because they didn't
have this foundation in store by me but
I really wanted to get 100 be just to
swatch for you guys because from what
I've seen from swatches and everything
it looks very very fair which is amazing
if I ended up picking up the shades
vanilla and shortbread because I felt
like vanilla might be too light
shortbread might be too dark so maybe I
could mix them or one of them might work
who knows as far as the packaging it
feels a little bit cheap
it's definitely plastic you don't get a
glass bottle I definitely think for
forty dollars they could have invested a
little bit more in the packaging so
let's read some of the claims on this
foundation I'm on hooter biddies website
it says it's a by the way can you say
who do beauty slow because I feel like
you just have to like roll your tongue
let me say it the full-coverage velvety
foundation available in 30 shades
supposed to hide blemishes conceal
imperfections camouflage dark circles
has ultra fine blah blah dries to a
radiant matte powder finish that looks
luminous not dry or cakey so those are
some words that you don't usually see in
the same sentence
radiant matte powder that looks luminous
I will say this is heavily scented I'm
talking heavily scented almost more than
like Dior foundations so if you're
sensitive to scents or you don't want to
be putting fragrance on your skin which
isn't the best for it I think this is
the most perfumed foundation I've ever
smelled doesn't smell necessarily bad it
just smells like a friggin candle so I'm
gonna search swatches right here of
these two shades compared to some of the
other foundations I own I'm gonna
include a few from her comparison chart
just so you guys can see how these
shades compare with those
alright so swatch time right here is the
Hoodoo Beauty foundation in 1:20 vanilla
next over is the hooter beauty in two
hundred shortbread Estee Lauder Double
Wear in one C one Marc Jacobs remarkable
in the shade ten and remarkable in
twelve NARS sheer glow in Siberia Kat
Von D tattoo foundation and l42 derma
called 2:08 which is like my perfect
shade match and then Fenty beauty
foundation in 100 all right so I think
that's everything if you're excited for
this video and you enjoy foundation
Friday don't forget to give this a
thumbs up if you're new here you can
join the baby radio family and subscribe
I upload Monday Wednesday Friday at 6
p.m. Pacific time let's get into it if
you want to see what I think of the huda
beauty folk filter foundation how to
apply somewhere throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching alright what's up good morning
good evening I guess when you guys are
watching this I
I'm so excited to try this one I've
already wash my eyes and primed half my
face using a Smashbox photo finish
primer Iser
I primed this side I'm actually on day
11 of accutane right now and I'm filming
this I'm going to try and get this one
up in the same week that I'm filming
this so this isn't like months
pre-recorded like the other ones why did
I just get like so much bit in my mouth
they couldn't talk anyways this video
I'm gonna try and get up in the same
week so it's Wednesday October 25th
right now when I'm filming this and I'm
gonna try and get this one up this
Friday since this is a foundation that
you guys have been asking about my point
being this has hyaluronic acid in it
which is really good for moisture so I
haven't watched these yet I haven't
taken them out of the box I really hope
I picked a shade I was so overwhelmed
there were so many options on there
I'm totally destroys box boxes friggin
like glued together
I'm just ripping it so here's vanilla
120-b oh that looks promising
shortbread 200b why was that one way
easier that one I think might be too
dark yeah I'm gonna first try vanilla
right here there's actually no
comparison for vanilla 1:20 beyond her
chart I don't know how accurate this
chart is because this is saying that 200
beef is similar to Marc Jacobs
remarkable in 10 you guys will have
already seen the swatches but I can tell
just from looking in this this is way
darker than Marc 10 I think I would
actually be like a mix of these two
shades almost I don't know which one to
use I think 200 B might be too dark but
I like the undertone of that butter okay
let's just first try vanilla and see how
that goes on exciting news have a new
foundation pellet candle lid it's like
usual language you have my face with the
brush this is a sigma f80 flat top
kabuki and the other way this button is
just going with vanilla I think I'm
gonna try the other one that one looks a
bit yellow just worry priming that spot
so while that side of my face dries and
everything that's going with shortbread
somebody's ass bun just start out whoa
it smells very heavily perfumed wooo get
in balm coverage this smells like a hair
product I guess smells like straight-up
hairspray which isn't the best if you
have sensitive skin like I do even with
a sponge that just covered everything
it's looking very
smooth really nice on the skin I'm gonna
go back in with the brush and get right
around my nose ring even covered my acne
on my neck really well ooh okay I have
hair root spray on right now and
sometimes it like transfers onto my
forehead so if you're new here I've
combination skin my problem areas are
usually at the center of my forehead
around my nose area have a lot of
texture on my face so sometimes
foundations emphasize it right there and
this one is looking really nice and
smooth everywhere it does seem to be
mattifying yeah it's definitely getting
less dewy let's see how this does with
the brush on the other side if I got
this much coverage with a sponge I am
really curious to see how this looks
here's before and after I did use a
decent why does this look like a
different color Oh was there still
someone the brush Fitzy's oh my god
wiping this off again there was
definitely still some of the other shade
on that brush so I'm gonna get a new
brush we're starting over third time's
the charm I switched brushes this is the
elf ultimate blending brush why do I
feel like it's still totally looking
lighter did this just already darken a
little bit I'm using 200 yeah whoa okay
so I feel like this is a bit more
difficult to blend out with a brush and
it's drying really quickly which I
didn't notice with the sponge a hundred
percent prefer how it looks with the
sponge and I feel like I'm getting the
same coverage it's looking a bit heavier
on this side I'm gonna switch back to
the sponge and just kind of smooth that
out it's drying really quickly yeah I
would say sponge is the way to go on
this one especially if you have texture
turtleneck and hoops are not ideal for a
foundation application so fish a does
not oxidize I think this is gonna be the
perfect shade I really like the kind of
beige undertone to it it might be a tiny
bit dark I could probably mix in a dab
of that other shade but I don't really
like the yellow and the other shade it
looks a tiny tiny bit heavy I feel like
this one would look really nice with the
Smashbox primer water underneath
because if I have a foundation that's
looking like this this usually helps to
just make it look a little bit more
radiant and skin like and everything I
like using this under the marc jacobs
remarkable but doesn't look overly heavy
right now there's just certain areas
where i feel like it looks a tiny tiny
bit heavy when you're really up close
but from far away it looks bomb it
covered all of my acne this is
definitely full coverage you could blend
powder products on top so i'm not gonna
set my face with this one also because i
do think this is one that would just get
way too heavy if i set my face just
knowing my skin and i was feeling this
would kind of Kate got more but so far
I'm feeling this one this looks really
nice I love that I only had to do one
layer to get complete coverage I also
feel like I almost don't really need
under-eye concealer I mean it covered my
under eyes pretty well right now it's
1048 we're gonna call the check-in time
10:45 I'm gonna do the rest of my makeup
and I'll be right back alright so right
now it's 11 26 I gotta film this fast at
the call at 12 so the rest of my makeup
is on I feel like when I was reading the
description of this foundation as I was
like eating breakfast this morning
before filming this the radiant matte
there's like four contradicting words in
there finish that they were talking
about was kind of confusing I wasn't
quite understanding how that was
possible now that is on my face I get it
it really is somehow like a radiant
matte kind like just a comfortable matte
it doesn't look too Matt it's not
accentuated in any of my texture
anything but it still is matte and I
still have a tiny bit of glow like
especially on my forehead which I
personally like I like a little bit more
dewy how long did that take me that took
me how long to do like nothing I do
definitely think this shade is not my
shade I walked out in the natural
lighting and it looks like it's my shade
when it's just on like this probably cuz
I'm wearing a turtleneck but compared to
my chest and then also just my arm and
everything's not quite my shade think
what I'm gonna do is return both these
shades actually and try and find a shade
that's closer to me because I don't
think I'm quite either of these and
there are a few shades in between those
four might actually try vanilla I think
I'm gonna wear this tomorrow Thursday
and I'll update you guys in the
description box how the shade vanilla
went this one I think is wearable but
since there are so many options I might
as well try and find one that works
better so so far so good on the rest of
my face I use it cosmetics my sculpted
face palette when I'm at this shade to
contour and then all of my eyeshadows
are also this palette I just
with like a mix of all these blushes the
BH Cosmetics floral blush in the shade
Fiji fun it's like this purpley mod one
lip smack burnt spice liquid lipstick
lashes are I lower accent 0:05 I like
these
they're just like the half lashes you
can pop on the outside and my highlight
is Burberry fresh glow 0-3 so pretty I
love this highlight that's it I think
right yep so check-in time is 10:45 I'll
see you guys in a few hours and natural
lighting okay so it's just like two
minutes after I just stopped filming but
I came out here and I was doing some
snaps and stuff and I just want to show
you guys what it looks like it's this
eyelash on sure what it looks like in
natural lighting right now because it
looks pretty damn good I feel like it
looks better and not for lighting than
it does under the studio lights right
now you're zoomed in like I love the way
my forehead looks right now I hope I
don't get super oily the rest of my face
is looking really nice I like it even
better now that I've seen it under this
light okay so right now it's 437 so it's
been on for almost 6 hours
shout out to Costco because this is my
new favorite sweatshirt of life and it
was like 15 bucks this thing is like
living in a blanket I've been sleeping
in it it looks good I'm getting a tiny
tiny bit of creasing on my upper lip and
it's separating a little bit on my
forehead I'm gonna zoom it goes in also
corner lashes don't seem to irritate my
eyes quite as much like I still have
them on six hours later get real up
close so I think you guys can see a tiny
bit of separating right there and then a
little bit of creasing not bad for me I
mean this is pretty normal I feel like
it looks pretty similar on both sides
maybe a tiny bit worse on this side but
overall I think it looks pretty good
right now I do feel like it's one of
those foundations that is oxidizing in
weird spots like on my chin which
happens very rarely with certain
foundations but it does happen and it
has oxidized a little bit I think I
would say about half a shade I don't
know I feel like my upper lip and chin
area look a little bit orangie or
something overall still really liking it
I think it looks really nice and smooth
I like the kind of doing us coming
through also as I was just working I
realized my first video to ever hit a
million views just happened which is
very exciting
six years on YouTube just hit a million
views and it actually wasn't the how to
paint furniture without sanding video
that was my most popular video for years
literally but dermatologist one can I
keep working I'll check back in with you
guys at the end of the night okay so
it's now 9:15 p.m. so it's been on oh my
alarm is gonna go off 10 hours have a
constant debate in my head about whether
this lighting during last check-in looks
better or the bathroom neither one is
ideal so let's just go with this one for
now so I'm gonna zoom in I can't put my
camera there it'll be a shadow
as you can see oh man I am hello oily
whoa keep in mind lights do always
bounce it back so it's not quite this
oily but I can tell you I was looking
out in the living room and it was pretty
damn close hold on I think we're gonna
go back out here because I feel like you
can never see this shade right I hope
you guys can tell but I feel like it has
continued to oxidize throughout the day
like now it definitely looks about the
reshapes too dark and it's looking more
orange in real life and what looks more
like beige brown on camera but in real
life it looks pretty orange I feel like
this one in the last couple hours like
on our 8 and 9 is when it really started
deepening the color aside I'm clearly
quite oily right now you still have that
separation happening right here and also
over there now it seemed to kind of rub
off down here uncle my chin right there
and then also over here I wasn't leaning
my hand or anything so I definitely
think I'm gonna try the shade vanilla if
it does oxidize this much I think that
one could work throughout the day the
foundations like this where it's not
super long-lasting on my oily skin but I
love the finish of it on its own and I
feel like if I did out of powder it
would get too heavy cakey because I had
that kind of look and feel to it this is
one that are mixed in
foundation that was longer-lasting so
maybe something like the covergirl clean
Mac BB cream that lasts amazing on my
skin controls oil really well so I would
mix the lighter shade with that one and
I think a combo like that could work
because I do really love how this looked
on my skin for the first pretty much
like seven eight hours I think really at
the eight nine hour point is when it
started not looking so great overall I
really liked how it looked I think this
is foundation that a lot of people will
love I say try it out get a sample up or
if you can so I think that is that I did
edit the video tonight this video that
you guys are watching right now
everything except this end clip right
here so this will be going up this week
which is cool because I rarely upload
like the same week so I feel like I'm
kind of talking to you guys in life time
so what's up hope you guys are having a
good week happy Friday
so tomorrow I'm gonna try the lighter
shade I won't be able to add in a club a
bit because I need to edit this video
tonight and wrap it up but I will do any
updates in the description box and also
kind of comment so if you guys enjoyed
this video don't forget to give this a
thumbs up I'm schvitzing in this jacket
right now holy crap
love you guys thanks for watching see
you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
