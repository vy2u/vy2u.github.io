alright so today it is foundation Friday
I am super excited for this one because
this is a different kind of situation
this is the covergirl custom blend
foundation the whole idea with this is
that there's actually an app that's
basically supposed to scan your face
tell you your custom shade ship it out
to you and it's supposed to be basically
an exact match to your skin tone so I
have lots of thoughts on this app to
start out with so we're going to start
out with the actual app in the process
and then go into some of the claims what
the foundation is supposed to do and
then the demo and you guys will see me
wearing it throughout the day like usual
so in the app store the app is called
covergirl custom blend you download the
app once you actually download the app
you have to sign up give them your email
all that kind of stuff and then they ask
you to describe the skin of your comment
your cone ask you to describe the tone
of your skin
I put very light they ask you to select
your ethnicity how would you categorize
your undertone which I put neutral in
the middle and then I ask what your age
is I do all that and then it gets to the
part where you're actually supposed to
scan your face using the app it actually
tells you to go and even indoor lighting
which I thought was a little bit strange
I tried it in both natural lighting and
indoor lighting under one of my studio
lights
I feel like natural lighting gives the
most true to color look of your skin so
not sure why they would have you stand
in indoor lighting I can also see a lot
of people who don't have studio lights
just going into a bathroom or something
which generally isn't the most accurate
lighting the actual scanning process was
bizarre to me so you're supposed
obviously do it without makeup on so I
didn't have makeup on I was wearing a
shirt that kind of went down so you
could still see my neck there's a circle
around your face that you're supposed to
line up it doesn't look like it actually
scans your neck which was a bit
concerning to me I don't know how
they're supposed to match your face to
your neck if they're not actually
scanning your neck you know I'm saying a
lot of times people's faces are actually
a bit darker than their neck but when
you're putting on a full face of makeup
you want your face to match the rest of
your body so I tried to scan four
different times because I was just
totally shocked at the result I was
getting the actual process it says to
keep turning towards your right until
scan is complete those words
felt very broad to me I try just a
couple different ways I first just kept
turning my head like this to the right
and it didn't look like a whole lot was
happening there's a bar that tells you
it's scanning and I kid you not every
single time I tried this I had to do it
from anywhere from three to five minutes
literally just turning my head it took
forever and a half to actually scan my
face certain points when you would turn
a yellow circle would light up so I felt
like that was a good sign it doesn't
tell you if that's the right thing that
you want or if that means that you're
out of frame or something so who knows
honestly if I wasn't doing this for a
video as I was scanning my face at the
consumer I probably would have pieced
the heck out it took way too long and
you didn't know if anything was actually
happening at one point I thought my app
froze so once the scanning is complete
they give you kind of a half face
breakdown where it says do you want to
match or enhance your look choose your
preferred look then customize your
bottle again super broad what the heck
does enhance foundation versus match
Foundation mean the only thing I could
distinguish was that the enhanced
foundation to me looked a little bit
darker and it also looked like a little
bit more coverage they kind of had my
face blurred out a bit more the match
foundation that looks more like my color
but it looks super light coverage and
you can see my acne on that side a lot
more than the enhanced side so like I
said I did this for time one of the
times I chose the enhanced foundation
the other time I chose the match
foundation I got the exact same numbers
so once you make it to the next page
they tell you your custom ID which is
basically your skin color your skin
intensity and your undertone and they
kind of rank it on the scale every
single time I got either 41 or 42 as
soon as I saw the bar was that far over
for this skin as a little concerned I am
typically the lightest or second to
lightest shade and pretty much any
foundation so the fact that they ranked
my skin color 41 yeah big flaw in the
app to me is that you can't go back from
this page so if I wanted to go back and
actually choose the Enhanced foundation
or the match foundation and see if the
numbers were different you can't do it
you have to do the entire process over
again I wish they would explain more on
here what these things actually mean I
think it would have been helpful too
be able to click on your skin color your
skin intensity and actually see what the
heck is skin intensity supposed to mean
I also wish you could drag it I know the
whole thing is that they're supposed to
customize it for you but for example if
I know 41 is going to be way too dark
for my skin tone I don't want to pay $25
product retails for $25 by the way and
you get one fluid ounce of product I
don't want to pay 25 bucks or something
if I know that it's going to be way off
I get that part of the experience is
them customizing it for you but what if
I want to adjust that you can't do it
you can try and try again to get a
lighter color or darker color if you
know you're actually deeper than what
they're giving you but every single time
that I did it I got within 41 or 42 so
the final color that I ended up getting
was 42 21 36 the reason why I tried two
more times was that I tried to get back
to that 41 number and I couldn't do it
that is what I went with so as soon as I
was tweeting about this I got tons of
tweets from you guys saying that you got
the exact same numbers that I did and
some of you were even saying that you're
a three or four shades darker than I am
so that is concerning to me you
literally think they might just pull
numbers from when they have you select
your tone and under tone of your skin
before hand depending on how you choose
your ethnicity they might add more
yellow undertones to it or pink
undertones or red undertones the only
thing that I enjoyed during this process
was actually getting to personalize your
label that was the best part that you
can type in whatever the heck you want
there you can choose the color of the
label and you can choose the font as
well obviously went with white and black
story my life and they give you a
description and ingredients so the only
claims that you can find about this
foundation are actually on the app I
don't know if the page is just down
right now but when I went on my computer
and on my phone both pages were
completely blank on covergirl so on the
app it says medium coverage formula with
a lightweight feel blends easily and
adapts to your skin for a natural no
makeup look this oil-free formula does
not clog pores and is suitable for
sensitive skin like I said this retails
for 25 bucks let's just let that sink in
this is covergirl covergirl a drugstore
brand and this is $25 so after that you
submit your shipping information and
then I
get a confirmation email that day it
shipped out pretty quick so what that
tells me is that there's not a whole lot
of customization going into this
logistically I'm guessing that they have
about ten shade combinations ready to go
and they just ship those out with those
three numbers and the range within those
I'm not going to do the math but there's
probably thousands of combinations that
you could actually get and I don't think
that's really happening she's not very
practical so when you get it in the mail
it comes in this box you get your
foundation on one side and then it
actually comes with a free mascara I
would rather pay a few dollars less and
not get a mascara in here but they do
give you a lash blast volume mascara
yes and they also give you a two dollar
fifty off coupon so I just realized on
the card that comes in the foundation
Epiphanes cards that comes in the box
tells you what the color intensity and
undertone is so that's helpful wish they
did that on the app before you're
purchasing it so the color measures the
lightness or darkness of your skin is
what you have in mind when you think of
skin tone we use a scale of twenty-five
to fifty and the higher the higher the
number what higher the number the
lighter your shade this is helpful to
note so fifty is technically lightest
shade so I'm a 42 so that means that
there are eight shades lighter than the
one that they gave me intensity tells us
how bright your skin is based on the
level of color saturation in your skin
our scale spans from fifteen to thirty
the higher your number the brighter your
skin so I got a twenty-one so thirty is
technically the highest undertone
determines the subtle hues of your
complexion cool skin has a pink or red
hue while warm skin has a yellow or
golden hue the scale ranges from thirty
to forty five and the higher your
undertone the warmer your complexion so
I got a thirty six forty five is the
highest I think I am more neutral kind
of warm so that actually I think is
pretty close color bar I think is the
most off and again you can't address it
yourself so this is very helpful I
really think they should have put this
on the actual app if I could look at
those numbers and know what they mean
before I actually gave covergirl my
credit card I think that would probably
help people purchase so as far as the
packaging how this comes I think it's
better than just throwing this in like a
bubble wrap but it doesn't seem super
custom it would have been really cool if
they could print your name
or something on part of the packaging
that would help make it feel a little
bit more custom some insert swatches
here of this custom foundation compared
to some of my other lightest shades of
foundation I am going to go run out
today and get the three-in-one
foundation so you guys can see how the
lightest shade of that compares to what
I was ranked with for this okay so
swatch gem here is my bow so custom
shade and the covergirl custom blend
foundation right here next to it I just
went and picked up the covergirl
three-in-one foundation so this is it in
the lightest shade 810 next over is the
pur cosmetics bear doll foundation of
porcelain this is a pretty good shade
match for me then next over is dermal
called 2:08
this one also works really well for me
these two look totally different but
they both work
here's maybelline fit me matte and
poreless in 110 and then last is the
covergirl clean matte BB and the
lightest shade which is way too dark for
me but I love this product and I usually
mix it with other foundations so as long
as definitely the pinkest out of all of
you pink and quite dark so I think as
all the claims and information I have on
this thing my nose is itching you guys
will see what I think of the shade and
how this applies in the demo but if
you're excited for this video and you
like foundation Friday videos make sure
you give this video a thumbs up if you
are new here you can join the baby doe
family and subscribe I upload Monday
Wednesday Fridays foundation Friday
every single Friday let's jump into the
video all right it is 751 a.m. on a
Saturday by the way this is marble
background my screen is not correct half
asleep right now but we are going to
wake up real quick to meet coffee Cheers
so I've already washed moisturized and
primed my face use my Joey anti blemish
matte primer like usual so I am very
curious about this because as you've
probably already heard in the intro
never been a shade 41 in my life let
alone in the middle category this in the
bottle looks very dark covergirl
foundations already tend to pull pretty
dark and they do oxidize a lot on my
skin tone so I'm actually going to pick
up my mom right after I film this so
might be looking like an oompa loompa
today so it looks like this is their
normal kind of pump Foundation bottle so
I'm coming out about a dime-size to
start so like usual I'm going to do half
my face over my sponge Cisco I'm gonna
do half my face with my Sigma f80 brush
and then on the other half of these my
dear cosmetic sponge
I kind of thought when you are going to
be customizing it you're going to be
able to kind of customize your coverage
that would kind of make sense for a
custom foundation it has a very pink
undertone it's always a little bit
difficult to see the true shade under
the lights but you can see a distinction
my neck looks a bit more yellow than
this foundation so I'm just going to
pull this all the way down basically to
the top of my shorts thing roll it so it
looks nice I mean it looks nice and
smooth so the covergirl three and on
foundation I have tried a couple times I
don't think I have an actual video on it
but it was just way too dark and it
oxidized shit-ton from what I'm
remembering from it this looks much more
dewy to me which I like this looks like
it has a nice satin kind of finish I
felt pretty good coverage this looks
like high medium coverage off of one
layer through my acne and everything
pretty well I'm gonna squeeze a bit more
out onto the palette and let's try
sponge on this side everyone's favorite
part - bouncing sound I just can't do it
slower I don't understand how you like
slowly Pat not trying to sit here for 10
minutes bouncing foundation oh my geez
okay I'm getting much lighter coverage
with a sponge
yeah the sponge this looks like about
low medium coverage I also feel like the
product isn't going as far with the
sponge and it's not looking textured on
my skin at all it looks very nice and
just kind of skin like my center of my
forehead looks really good you want to
see if this is buildable Simon squeezed
a tiny bit out and just go in on some of
the spots to see if it covers okay
totally buildable
now we're getting yeah full coverage
sweet I'm not going to bring this into
my nose area just focusing this one
where I need more coverage the
three-in-one didn't fit on my skin is
nice this one is totally just kind of
melting into my skin definitely too dark
so I would have to mix this next time I
wore it as far as I'm actually matching
this to my skin tone the I give that
about a zero point five out of ten I'm
going to get up close and show you guys
because this does look very nice so
lights are turned down look at the
finish of this I mean it looks really
nice it doesn't look cakey anywhere it's
just sitting on my skin really nicely
literally just kind of melt it in and
look at that coverage and we got full
average down here center of my forehead
doesn't look textured at all
so right now the coverage in the formula
I'm liking so it's now 802 I'm going to
do the rest of makeup not sure I think I
might set this one with the powder I
don't know I'm really liking the finish
of it and stuff right now I need to do
something with this hair what is
happening okay so it's now 826 8:30 a.m.
we're going to call the check-in time 8
o'clock because that's pretty much when
I finish my face I did end up setting my
face I use the Mac's lecturer press
pattern nc5 just to try and match my
face a little bit better to my body I
just use a super light kind of dusting
of powder I didn't really put a ton on
today and it looks really nice my skin
looks just like skin it doesn't look
like there's a ton of makeup sitting on
top of it the radiance is still coming
through or if you guys can see on my
forehead but my skin just looks really
nice and healthy right now pretty much
liking everything except the shade right
now so I'm going tell you guys what's on
the rest of my face so to contour slash
bronze I use the Burberry earthy blush
in number 7 light glow this is in shadow
image video I'm not sure if that's going
to be going up before this or what but
there it is the blush I used is Max
Factor nude Moz blush this is so pretty
love this color gives you a really nice
glow too and then my highlight is the
hourglass ambient light ethereal light
this is their lightest ambient lighting
powder I've been using the other shade
which I thought was the lightest but
they actually have one lighter totally
forgot
also my eye shadows the makeup
revolution I love makeup fast love
palette these were a bit patchy I just
went in with the matches over here and
let's say use a combo of the lip color
contour February in medium 0-3 and then
their nude beige 500 lipstick looks like
this this one is super pretty this is
one of those ones that you can layer on
top of anything and it looks good so
that's everything that's on my face
right now the next check and I do will
be in natural lighting I'll probably be
with my mom if you haven't seen it I'm
going to link the mom tag over here if
you want to get to know Mom Bay Rito's
alright so it is a one o'clock I'm here
with Mama buried over there we went to
Discovery Park and now we're going to go
eat some lunch but I wanted to do a
check-in hope I'm not covering
right now it's been five hours and I
feel like in the car lighting you can
really tell how much darker this is it's
oxidized but it also just looks way too
pink and darks but as far as the actual
formula and how it's looking it still
looks really smooth I think you think
yes the colors way off yeah but as far
as how it looks I do think it looks
pretty natural to finish up it if it was
the right shade and I'm getting a tiny
bit of creasing on my upper lip but
around my nose it looks pretty good on
my pores some of my forehead and really
look like how it looks I'm actually
getting a little bit of separation over
here which is a little odd yeah way dark
not now you can definitely tell but
we're going to go do Seattle things run
to target and why are you guys and I'll
check back in at the end of the night
okay so it's now 602 p.m. so the
Foundation's been on for eight No ten
hours we have been running errands
grocery shopping all that good stuff
have changed like 10 times today but
let's talk about the foundation so it
has majorly majorly oxidized hopefully
you guys saw it in the car lighting
because again in here you can't really
even tell the shade but it's definitely
about three shades to dark now
she just looks super off in real life
but it's held up really nicely for being
on for 10 hours it looks really good it
doesn't look heavy anywhere I do feel
like it has kind of a natural skin like
look to it it's starting to separate a
bit on my forehead something is
noticeable unless you were literally
staring like an inch away in the mirror
there I think you can see a little bit
of the separation happening doesn't look
super great but I am super close to the
camera right now in real life someone
probably wouldn't get that close to your
face do examine your foundation like I
said in the check-in is separating a
little bit on the side of my face my try
using a different primer with this
here's kind of the separation over here
so here's what it looks like up close
again I think for ten hours which is
hard to stay in focus right now there we
go like my pores for me look pretty good
they look pretty nice and smooth since I
like how it gives kind of a more skin
like look but it is too dark I think
mix this with something like the Marc
Jacobs remarkable in the lightest shade
because that one's a bit too light and
it can look a tiny bit heavy so
something like this I feel like would
help make it look a little bit more
natural ball so lighten it what I paid
$25 for this definitely not this reminds
me actually a lot of the Ready Set
gorgeous foundation by covergirl the
feel and look of it feels very
lightweight and it just looks and feels
like skin so if you want a similar look
I would say just go with the covergirl
Ready Set gorgeous foundation 25 bucks
to me for this foundation is ridiculous
especially considering the technology I
feel like was not that great with the
whole face scan and shade matching and
everything but it's fun and it's
something different I do commend them
for doing something kind of
out-of-the-box and different for a
drugstore product just fell a little
short in my opinion so if you guys liked
this video make sure you give it a
thumbs up you can always let me know
down below what foundations you want to
see next in foundation Friday love you
guys thanks for watching see you my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
