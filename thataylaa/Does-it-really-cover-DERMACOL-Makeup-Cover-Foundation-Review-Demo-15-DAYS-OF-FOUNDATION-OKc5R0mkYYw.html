all right so today it is day 8 of 15
days of foundation this is where I'm
trying out a new foundation every single
day for 15 days in my time when I'm
filming this I just posted the t-shirt
announcement video yesterday so I just
wanted to say a huge thank you to you
guys for all your support already and
just all the kind messages and thoughts
I love seeing that much positivity in
the comments section and just with each
other too if you miss that video I will
link it down below but it talks all
about the fifty news foundation t-shirts
and project Beauty share I forgot to
mention this in that video but
unfortunately Amazon merch doesn't ship
outside the US a fairly new program and
they have said that they're trying to
ship outside of the US soon so if that
doesn't change soon I'll look into other
platforms to put the t-shirts on because
I want everyone be able to contribute
and get a t-shirt so today's foundation
I am super excited for because this is
supposed to be intense intense extreme
coverage this is the derma call film
studio makeup cover lots of you guys
have asked me to do this one this kind
of blew up from tachi Glee and life guru
but this has been around for years
there's a bunch of other foundation
videos on it not a whole lot from the
u.s. because this is a European brand
but you can get it on Amazon or Ebay
depending on where you get it now it's
about twelve to seventeen dollars I know
about a year ago it was around like
eight bucks so it has gone up beauty of
Amazon and eBay if there's demand they
jack up the price so this is waterproof
has an SPF of 30 in it and this is
supposed to be able to cover tattoos
cover literally anything you actually
get a little over one ounce of product
in this tiny tube even though it looks
small you're getting still an ounce of
product which is pretty standard and
retails for about fifteen dollars so I
think that's a pretty dang good deal the
packaging is nice simple it's just a
squeeze tube gold packaging I'm actually
pretty sure I saw this in Jordan when I
was living there I feel like this was
one of those foundations and then when I
looked on the instructions there's a ton
of Arabic on here since this is a
European foundation I'm pretty sure I've
seen this in like a market in Jordan so
let's go on and read some of the claims
so it comes in 13 shades I actually have
two shades here to show you I bought the
shade 207 as well as 208 because on line
two
Oh eight looked a little bit lighter I'm
going to search some swatches right now
so you can see how this foundation
compares to some of the other
foundations that I go on alright swatch
time so here's the derma call and 207
right next to it is 208 as you can see
208 is a little bit lighter and
definitely more beige Kat Von D lock-it
tattoo and l4d2 Maybelline fit me matte
and poreless 110 Urban Decay Naked skin
foundation in 0.5 so it says that this
was created as the first of his kind in
Europe and one of the first in the world
the license was sold to Hollywood
it contains 50% pigments which makes it
a weapon against skin imperfections it's
supposed to be able to correct dark
under-eye as well
unpleasant spots and skin blemishes
completely covers acne loss of
pigmentation post-surgical bruising
tattoos it can be used on the entire
face or body and it's widely used as a
professional makeup for photo or film
modeling and for festive occasions so
this is supposed to be like heavy duty
all you ever need full-coverage Fitness
derma call does not test on animals glow
is that like really lightheaded
probably breakfast that is all the
claims I have a combination skin I
usually get pretty oily throughout the
day on my t-zone and I have a lot of
acne scarring and stuff to cover up if
you're new here you can join the Bay
radio family and subscribe it'll notify
you every single time put up a new video
we can be friends it'll be fun if you're
enjoying 15 days of foundation don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up
and if you want to see how this
foundation applies somewheres throughout
the day you're in the right place just
keep watching all right so I've already
wash my eyes prime of my face I'm going
to take the tape Tate I'm going to take
the shape 208 because this actually
swatched lighter than 207 I might end up
mixing the two if this one's to offer
too pink so we'll see a little bit of
this is supposed to go super far so I'm
literally just going to take some bows
on my finger let's just dab on here I
have no idea how much we're going to
need I might start with that and I'm
going to take my Sigma f80 two on one
side of my face this is the round top
kabuki brush I feel like the round table
sense is a little more compact it just
blends out stiffer friend
a little bit better so let's see if this
is enough whoa whoa
holy cease so that amount is
definitely enough might actually need a
little bit more for my forehead but that
just totally covered everything so the
light shade looks good this looks pretty
light which is exciting and this has a
super pretty like satin almost dewy
finish we'll see if it kind of mattifies
when it sets if someone try the sponge
on the other side of my face like normal
not sure how this is going to go and I'm
literally taking like not even a pee
what is this this is like a tenth of a
peanut see how it works with sponge oh
my gosh this has such good coverage
blend out totally fine with a sponge and
finish looks pretty much the same I
think you could go with either one I
kind of like the brush a little bit
better for some reason with this so for
my forehead I'm just going to dab whoa
that just shot out of there this tiny
amount of product that just shot out
that would be like 10 faces worth the
fact that this is super affordable and
this goes a really long way is very
exciting these are like minuscule drops
you guys I am impressed right now this
looks really good do not need a second
layer for this for sure for the amount
of product that I just put on my face
this is unreal even though it has insane
coverage it feels very lightweight like
I don't really feel it on my skin at all
looks so nice on the skin doesn't look
heavy or anything alright so I'm going
to apply the rest of my makeup what time
is it right now we're calling the
check-in time it's 8 o 7 so let's just
call it 8:10 I'm gonna play the rest of
our makeup and I'll be right back
alright just kidding I'm back so I just
tried this as under eye concealer
because I had so much squirted out of
here and that just covered everything
with a
even kidding like such a miniscule
amount so I'm just going to dab this so
you guys can see I just got really good
coverage under there and I don't have a
lot of product under my eyes at all so
I'm going to set this with the powder I
think I am going to set my whole face
with the powder today and I will be
right back alright so it's now eight
twenty six I did end up setting the rest
my face with the powder I used the Laura
Geller double take baked versatile
powder foundation in porcelain and
modified things a little bit but as I
was doing the rest of my makeup you can
see the dew is still coming through
which I love I hate when powders totally
modify a foundation so I love that this
one still has a really nice finish
coming through I have no complaints
right now this looks absolutely
beautiful since you have to use such a
small amount to get complete full
coverage it just sits on my skin really
nice it's not settling in anywhere my
forehead looks frickin flawless right
now like it's not settling in any of the
lines or anything everything blended out
fine on top so as of right now I'm into
this I hope this wears well throughout
the day let's take a flash photo right
now to see this is supposed to be good
for weddings and special men all that
good stuff so let's see how it looks it
looks like there's a little bit but
nothing horrible it doesn't look like I
have total ghost face or anything but
there does look like there's a tiny bit
of bounce back on flash I don't know
what to do with this because this is
literally like gold to me right now
I might go put it in like a little jar
or something so I can use this so to
bronze I used hourglass ambient luminous
bronze light I've been really liking
this and then I also mixed a little bit
of pixi by petra subtly suntouch blushes
from this tarte holiday palette and it's
the ironic blush highlight hourglass
diffused light eyeshadow I just put that
same bronzer into my crease use the
color pop eyeshadow in Brady and then
essence eyeshadow in apricot a
positioners formula eye booster Too
Faced better than sex maybelline smooth
taupe lipstick with Anastasia Beverly
Hills butterscotch lip gloss over top so
I'd be out of the house a lot today I'm
going to
and check in between things so I will be
back check in in a few hours in natural
lighting it is now 1:30 so the
Foundation's been on for a little over 5
hours it looks good it just looks really
smooth and like natural finish wise but
I have insane coverage it looks slightly
do here but I personally like that I
love the shade of this it looks great
around my nose and upper lip I'm not
really getting any creasing around there
yeah it just looks really good around my
nose upper lip forehead
I have zero complaints right now I think
it looks great this will probably be a
longer check-in because I'm going out to
happy hour here in a little bit and I'll
be coming back not sure what time so we
shall see how it holds up I really like
it right now alright so it is now 8
o'clock so the Foundation's been on for
almost exactly 12 hours let's take a
look
change the shirt so overall I think it
looks pretty damn good obviously I'm a
little bit oily but the lights again
bounce off and reflect off your face so
I never look as oily in real life as
it's showing up on camera I didn't get
any creasing on my upper lip my around
my nose area looks really good as far as
it under my eyes I do have some major
under-eye creasing I probably wouldn't
wear this as under-eye concealer I do
look oily like on my forehead I might
try it with a different powder next time
but it doesn't look horrible or anything
alarm to film this nothing major
actually got complimented on my skin
today which is rare I just love the
coverage of this I love the way that it
went on I would 100% wear this again
really like this one I don't think that
this is one of those foundations that
you can kind of like shear down really
easily like the Marc Jacobs remarkable I
think you should only get this if you
want very very intense coverage because
that's what it's intended for for 1517
bucks I think this is totally worth it
if that's what you're going for dry skin
this could work I think more mature skin
it hasn't settled into any lines or
anything anywhere and it
on kind of Dewey so I think that this
one could work or the skin you might
have to blot or set with a really good
mattifying powder so this one I give two
thumbs up if you guys liked this video
and are enjoying 15 days foundation
don't forget to give this a thumbs up by
the way I forgot to mention since I'm
pre recording days 1 through like 9 I
