went back to Fred Meyer which is the
fricken most amazing store on planet
earth and also went to Rite Aid and it
got way too much stuff so now I'm going
to show you guys if you saw in my last
drugstore haul you guys likes that kind
of like review video so I did try out a
few of these things beforehand and some
of them I haven't opened yet so it'll be
a surprise for all of us yeah
at this point I feel like I just need to
get a tent and camp out in fred meyer
because it is basically the greatest
place on planet earth let's just start
so if you saw that last haul you know
that the fred meyer is a freaking
god-sent makeup section they have pretty
much everything that is new and limit
edition it is amazing also still sick
sorry about the nasally voice hope you
can't hear the shower right now first
thing is the covergirl Ready Set
gorgeous foundation they had a whole
display of the covergirl Ready Set
gorgeous line which is brand new
they have concealers powders makeup
wipes I think which is kind of random
the lightest shade was 105 and that's
what I got I have a feeling this is
still gonna be too dark so mix it in
with my Manic Panic
dreamtone to lighten it I've heard good
things about this foundation let me know
if you guys want to see a karate with me
video using this foundation the thing is
if I do a first impression video on
foundations that are too dark for me I
would have to mix in the Manic Panic and
I don't know
how much that would alter the original
formula and kind of skew the review so I
don't know let me know what your guys
thoughts are on that if not we can just
use didn't get ready with me and move on
with life so then I picked up two of the
new Fergie wet-and-wild
lipsticks can we just look at the
packaging of this I feel like this looks
so classy it's actually wet and wild
Fergie and wet and wild have been
working together to make some makeup and
these two lipsticks I picked up from
their limited edition lipstick line so
the first one I got is in the shade
Ferguson Crest Cabernet
interesting name it looks deeper purple
than it really is I'm wearing it on my
lips right now in the center mixed with
the Palladio lip liner in blackberry
that you can get off of Amazon so I'll
just swatch it for you guys Lok sale so
here's a swatch you can see how frickin
pigmented these are they are so creamy
the formula of these is way better than
the original wet-and-wild lipsticks it
looks like a satin finish to me it's
definitely not matte goes on so smooth
so pigmented I literally had to put one
swipe on my lips and that's the color
that you're seeing right now second
shader guys old-school glam and it is
this like morons color red orange if you
didn't catch that look at this freakin
color so beautiful feel like this will
be a really fun like summery kind of
read since it is on the brighter orange
side these were super affordable they
retail from like 350 to $5 depending on
the store you get it I I would
definitely recommend going and trying
these if you're interested because they
are limited edition and they're amazing
for the price
go get them you know I love my essence
had to get something so essence has a
new Viva Brasil limited edition
collection which is all these like crazy
bright colors and nail polishes and
things like that if you follow my
Instagram then you saw a picture of the
display the only thing that really
caught my eye from the collection is
this blush and this is in the shade 0-1
I love Brazil I posted a picture on
Instagram wearing this world the story
is just go follow my Instagram super
pigmented easy to blend out I love these
kind of like bright pink colors so if
you don't then you probably wouldn't
like this but it's just like a muted
kind of fuchsia
and it's just super soft and easy to
blend out like I said I was really cute
wording on it which is the name of
cities in Brazil I've just had really
good experiences with essence lately I
think this was around 350 so super good
price then I got to nail products I
guess you would call them the first is
this kiss watch calling really
lightheaded okay
the first is this kiss gel dress gel
polish whatever you want to call these
they're basically nail plucking stickers
these come with 4d gel strips which I
thought was really good you don't need
an LED light to cure these it says you
can smooth on and file them and apply a
topcoat for one week of wear if you want
two weeks aware then you can use the gel
topcoat I just really love the whole
galaxy nail thing and I'm not about to
do that myself that would be an epic
failure so I got these and there's 40 of
them which is cool they have a full and
half one so you could use these for like
tips which I'll probably use because my
nails are frickin super long right now
so then I got a wet n Wild mega last
nail polish which is this brightest
yellow color it's called a Venice day I
pretty sure this was from their summer
collection I want to say I really like
this line of wet wild nail polish it has
a really huge brush which I like because
you literally just have to go over your
nails like two times yeah I just wanted
to you know branch out and try yellow
nail polish then I got some really
exciting deodorant
the first is Old Spice pure sport I know
this is a man deodorant I don't care I
just got this to put in my purse that's
getting a little hot and fitzy out you
know so gotta stay fresh then I got the
secret clinical strength deodorant in
sport fresh and I have never tried this
stuff but my roommate is is it and the
sport fresh scent smells like man you
know I'm all about the man sense the
last thing I got from Fred Meyer was
Garnier olia hair color in soft black
I've tried this stuff one time before it
makes your hair so soft so silky I'm not
kidding you get out of the shower and it
feels like you've just got like a
keratin treatment also Fred Meyer was
doing like a two dollar off coupon thing
with
so I thought why not and my roots are
getting a little bit ratchet so it's
time
so I also went to Rite Aid and thought I
would show you guys the stuff because I
haven't really instagrammed it or
anything like that nothing too exciting
but why not show you what we're doing a
haul anyway free whoa what is going on
with my hair awesome how long has that
been like that this is like fifth day
hair right now
gotta love dry shampoo Rite Aid was
doing a buy one get one free off all
right aid brand products I got both of
these products for a total of like six
dollars which is crazy so the first one
is the acne wash daily scrubs House of
acne treatment did I just was that
English salicylic acne treatment this
was sitting next to the Neutrogena one
that I usually the rapid clear I think
it is that I usually go for or so well
this was like two dollars cheaper but
also I looked at the back on the
ingredients and they were the exact same
ingredients as a Neutrogena one so I
thought why am I paying two dollars more
for the exact same thing you're
basically just paying for the brand
thought I'd try this one and see how it
is compared to the Neutrogena one so
Vaseline came out with this new like
spray on lotion thing and I've heard
good things about it I wanted to try the
Rite Aid one to see if it compares this
is the Coco brilliant spray lotion
it's a non-greasy formula and I have
been using this for like a week now and
what I do is just spray it on when I get
out of the shower it's really nice it
doesn't feel greasy at all it's kind of
expecting it to feel like a sunscreen
because also I think of when I see this
frickin can it feels like lotion when
you rub it into your skin and then it
just dries a few seconds later and
completely like goes into your skin
which I thought was really cool also if
you're like in a rush and have to get
dressed right after and you don't want
to wait for your like lotion to drag
freakin hate putting on jeans when you
have like lotion tea legs that just mean
but this stuff is great because it dries
super fast and it also smells really
good I mean a cocoa butter usually
smells like so then I got the Loreal
power volume 24h powered up lashes
waterproof formula says no one here I
redid this or instagrammed it someone
said that this isn't new it's been out
for a while so I don't know I've never
tried it I do like the L'Oreal
voluminous
a lot I've been really branching out
with my mascara game lately if you saw
my last get ready with me video kind of
obsessed with the Maybelline falsies
lately just going all out and trying
some new ones last thing I got at Rite
Aid is this freaking thing right here
these are the cone air heat rollers it's
Judy's time or Judy always it uses these
to get ready and it's super nice because
you can just put them in your hair while
you're doing your makeup and then once
you're done with your makeup you just
take them out and your hair is already
done so you don't even have to like fuss
with it I've been eyeing these for
forever at Rite Aid but they are $30
when I was at Rite Aid they had a $15 up
reward when you bought this so basically
turned out to be $15 so I thought you
know this is sign I gotta get him gotta
try him out that's what I told myself
I'm really curious to try them out
haven't tried to my old yeah I got this
bad boy so that was everything that I
got at Rite Aid and Fred Meyer again
went a little crazy if you like this
video and you like these kind of haul

a thumbs up so I know be sure to let me
know down below if you guys want to see
a review or whatever video using the
Ready Set gorgeous foundation super
