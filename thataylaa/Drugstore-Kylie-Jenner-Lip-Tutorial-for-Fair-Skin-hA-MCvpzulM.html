intro inspired alright I think we're
good so today I have a super quick and
easy tutorial there's only two products
involved both of them can be found at
the drugstore and I think you could
still hear that siren if you're on
Instagram or YouTube or anywhere you've
probably seen the Kylie Jenner lip trend
going around I wasn't gonna make a video
about it because I feel like there's
been thousands of videos about it but I
was searching for one for fair skin and
I couldn't find it so here we are so if
you want to see how I got this lip look
then you're in the right place just keep
watching
ignore the boy hair right now was it
happening alright so we are gonna start
out with the NYX liner and mob this is a
perfect kind of neutral shade that isn't
too dark to wear out on a daily basis
but isn't light enough that it looks
nude so I'm just going to completely
fill in my lips with this stuff you can
get this at Ulta or some drugstores this
one America Enix
these Knicks liners are a little weird
in the sense that if you draw over the
same spot too many times it kind of gets
like stuck on the line so I try and draw
the shape as best as you can the first
time around I am going to be slightly
over drawing my bottom lip I don't like
to over draw my top lip because I look
like not cute so after I've created that
shape I'm just going to go ahead and
fill everything in
so if you have a bit of a darker
complexion than I do
just some off lipliner would probably do
just fine for you but since we're a
little long tale princess I'd the step
is for you so then I'm gonna take the
Maybelline lipstick and this is in the
shade 860 smooth taupe this is an oldie
but a goodie this is a good nude
lipstick on its own for fair skin I do
prefer to put it on top of liner because
it can make you look a little bit dead
so we're just going to go over top of
that next liner and let's do it
what is on my hand I don't know what
this is
all right so you can see that that just
helped to lighten everything up a little
bit I'm gonna go back in with the NYX
liner and just blend it on the corner
edges just so we don't have liner and
then lipstick everything is just blended
you know what I mean
I want to leave this inner part of your
lip the lightest because that's what's
gonna make your lips look bigger so
there you go
like I said both of these products can
be found at the drugstore they're super
affordable if you have fair skin and
you're looking for more tutorials for
your skin tone I'll leave a playlist
below I have a bunch of videos for
people with fair skin you can also check
out my shadow and schmooze videos
because all those I do foundation and
face products and all that kind of stuff
so obviously it's all stuff that works
for fair skin if you liked this video
and it was helpful for you be sure to
give it a thumbs up so I know love you
guys thanks for watching see you next
video bye oh my god so much brighter
seriously after I filmed the entire
video isn't it amazing how one human
being can start this whole frickin lip
trend going on why do we even care about
Kylie I don't know but I do like her
lipstick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
