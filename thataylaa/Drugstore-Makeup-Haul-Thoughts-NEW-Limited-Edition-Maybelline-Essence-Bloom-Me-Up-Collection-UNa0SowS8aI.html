an hour and I'm sitting here filming a
makeup video instead welcome to senior
year of college so if you're following
my Instagram you know that I found this
frickin godson drugstore I felt like I
was in Disneyland but better I think we
literally spent three hours in that
store pictures here of what we did I
can't say the name of the place because
I'm pretty sure it's only in my state
but it was unreal it kind of felt like
it was more like an Ulta than a
drugstore they had essence Milani NYX I
was in freaking heaven I posted a
picture of the essence counter on
Instagram do you see this probably could
have stood in front of that and just
stared at it for an hour in addition to
having different brands and stuff they
had huge displays of all the new
limited-edition collections new
collections for summer the bleach neons
Maybelline collection it was dangerous
I've been really into this whole like
limited edition collection thing lately
I feel like if it says limited edition
on it I have to get my hands on it even
if it's not something that I would
normally pick up that's probably what
they intended to happen so naturally I
picked up some stuff I just wanted to
see kind of like a review breakdown haul
thing of what I got I kind of like these
just like informal videos because I can
kind of just talk about whatever the
heck I want to talk about is that kind
of the point of YouTube anyways that was
side note I feel like I do a lot of
frickin drugstore makeup shopping and I
usually post on Instagram but I never
really do haul videos because they never
feel like it's enough to do a haul but
let me know if you guys like these kind
of like smaller review type of fall
videos because I can actually go like
more in depth about the product and
things like that and I can just talk
about whatever you know let's get into
it so I'm gonna start with essence stuff
like I said the homeless people across
the street right now are like tripping
out so if we hear some yelling you know
who it is the first thing I got is from
the limited edition essence blew me up
collection and this is
shimmer powder has super pretty flower
detailing on the front
I wasn't expecting too much from this
because first off I found very few good
drugstore highlighters so I don't know I
never really have high expectations for
them but this is freaking beautiful you
can't really tell when it's washed why
don't we just put it on let's do it as
you can see it just gives you the
prettiest light pink glow it doesn't
look chocky or anything like that for a
drugstore highlighter I am super
impressed I think that was like 3 or 4
dollars - so hello I also picked up this
essence superheros nail polish this is
also I think part of some limited
edition collection it says it's a
holographic effect very curious to try
out this you'll probably see an
Instagram picture on this - next is this
gelatin which I am super excited about
this is also by essence it's in the
shade zero - deep red I have it on my
lips right now so this is supposed to be
a gelatin for long-lasting color this is
just with one layer on right now and
I've got to say I am pretty impressed
with this and I'm trying to get it out
of the box also on the nails is sepg
because I know I'm gonna get questions
seriously okay that's you so it comes in
this packaging I like it looks pretty
sleek kind of writes me up the hourglass
lip colors has like a doe foot
applicator it smells like straight-up
cherry pie
when it goes on it definitely feels like
a water-based formula you kind of have
to let it dry for a second to like soak
into your lips I love the color I think
this would be a great kind of summertime
red because it is a gelatin so you don't
have to worry about like messing with
your red lipstick all day feel like it's
a wearable red and it doesn't look like
I just like tried super hard it feels a
nice on the lips a little bit tacky
we'll see by the end of this video how
it's feeling I definitely want to try
other shades of these let me know if you
guys have tried this and what colors you
like I don't know why I didn't get more
essence stuff I guess the drugstores not
going anywhere when I got there I felt
like it was gonna disappear then they
had the Maybelline bleach neons
collection and they also had the summer
2014 collection I only picked up one
thing from the bleach neons collection
because I'm not usually a fan of like
cream blushes and bronzers because it's
always weird to me how I have to put it
on before my face powder and then I just
feel like I need to put like powder
blush or bronzer on top of it and I just
feel like it's kind of like an
unnecessary step that I don't really
need to take so the only thing I picked
up is this limited edition
bronzer and this is in the shade that
sucks subtle bronze 210 what drew me to
this was how a light of bronzer it was
clearly don't really have a tan going on
right now so whenever I find a brown
that would I feel like would be good for
fair skin gotta get it so I've never
watched this or anything before so let's
just do it it looks like it has a little
bit of shimmer in it whoa hard to swatch
that way ooh let's see how blends up
whoa it feels super silky doesn't even
feel like anything actually that's
really pretty
I'll probably be using this in my next
get ready with me video so be on the
lookout for that if you want to see how
it applies I think that was like eight
bucks which I feel like it's kind of
expensive
I don't know comment down below if you
have any things from the bleach neons
collection that you think is a must in
that I should try out because I don't
know I wasn't really drawn to anything
else that much so the last thing I
picked up they also had Kardashian
beauty which I think that's the only
store by me that actually carries that I
know most CVS is carry Korea
Beauty but I don't have a CVS so welcome
to living in bumfuck nowhere Kardashian
beauty it was all everything was 50% off
can tell how successful their makeup
line is I picked up these lashes because
they kind of reminded me of like more
dramatic Mac 35 I really love like the
PC kind of lashes I just feel like those
have the most flattering on my eyeball
and I really like the packaging of these
with the rose gold and everything it's
kind of drawn to it I can't get over
this bronzer it's really pretty so after
I died and went to heaven in that store
I went to Rite Aid because I thought
let's just keep the drugstore shopping
spree going why stop now you know so I
wanted to pick up a couple of the revlon
colorburst matte bombs because one of
you guys mentioned it I love matte
lipsticks I'm always down for a good
matte lipstick so I want to try these
out and I've tried the Revlon bombs
before and I really like how they're
like minty I don't usually like scents
and lipsticks like right now I kind of
feel like I'm slowly eating a popsicle
my favorite Kate Moss lipstick is this
kind of color I'll swatch it for you
guys this is in the shade 225 sultry
what is that word never seen that word
in my life let's just watch it there it
is super pretty kind of muted red color
smells like I have tried and gum on my
hand the formula of these is really
great they're super smooth easy to apply
then I picked up this random like orange
a shade and this is 235 mischievious
okay I'm starting to think this I can
wear it is just in another language
because or they just decided to like
make up a whole new vocab or should we
put this put it here I think I just
wanted to get this to like try something
new not really my thing
no I learned that I don't do orange
lipsticks I think I wouldn't be
returning this one because yeah I just
really doesn't work for me might look
good on someone who's a little bit
tanner or has some all of these stuff
going on but mm-hmm
no essence update a little bit tacky
just feels like a gel I'm kind of
curious to see if the gel filling goes
away and if it kind of like mattifies or
if it stays like this I don't know but I
like it I love the color
and so that was just kind of a quick
little chitchat of all the new drugstore
stuff I got if you like this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up so I know
but yeah let me know if you guys like
these type of videos and I can do more
of them love you guys thanks for
watching and see you in my next video
