right now I'm to feel like I need to put
sunglasses on so if I'm squinting that's
why I'm super excited for this video
today is actually requested by my friend
in real life she commented on an
Instagram picture saying that do you
like really wants to get more into mega
but she doesn't really know where to
start and then I was like you're totally
right that would be a good idea to do
kind of a drugstore makeup starter kit I
workout Mac and there's people all the
time you come in with their parents like
younger girls who want to start wearing
makeup and it kind of kills me in a way
because you don't need to spend hundreds
and hundreds of dollars on your first
makeup or makeup at all
99% of the makeup I wear on a daily
basis is drugstore makeup so this is
kind of to help people who are just
getting into makeup all of this stuff is
super reasonable you don't need to buy
all of it it's just kind of like my
suggestions for what I would get if I
was just getting into makeup and wanted
to experiment and learn more have a get
ready with me kind of shadow and
schmooze video on the look I'm wearing
right now so if you want to see that I
will link right here and it will open
new video it is pretty much all
drugstore makeup okay so let's just
start out with primer which in my
opinion is a must
primer is what you put on before your
makeup is going to help smooth your
pores make you have a clean canvas for
what you're going to put on your face it
makes me cringe when people don't use
primers this is the maybelline instant
age rewind primer I've used this for
probably two years and whenever I'm kind
of like sick of trying out a new primer
I always seem to go back to this this
retails for about I want to say eight to
ten dollars at the drugstore
it's a silicone based primer doesn't
have a strong smell this is just my
go-to primer so drugstores is kind of
tricky for me to just pick one because
it kind of really depends on what you're
going for comment down below if you guys
want a whole like favorite drugstore
foundations video because I have way too
many to just choose one but if I had to
choose one liquid foundation from the
drugstore I would go with maybelline
superstay this is my baby I've again use
this for probably four years I use this
in high school and I still use it to the
day I just love the coverage this gives
it lasts for forever you won't get oily
this is just amazing so as far as
drugstore concealers go
I'm also mentioning stuff that you can
get at Ulta and Walmart which is still
in like the drugstore range so my
favorite drugstore concealers I have two
the first one is a NYX HD photogenic
concealer this is definitely more of a
full coverage concealer I use this
pretty much every day
my other favorite concealer is the
maybelline instant age rewind concealer
this doesn't have as good of coverage
and it does have a sponge applicator
which is questionably unsanitary so
that's kind of a downside but I do like
the formula of this I use under my eyes
as well as all over my face but if
you're just looking for a concealer for
spot treatment then I would go with the
next HD concealer when you're applying
under-eye concealer or liquid foundation
you definitely want to set that with a
powder I have two powder foundations
that I love the first is Rimmel stay
matte unfortunately this breaks me out
like crazy but I know a lot of people it
doesn't so if you don't have sensitive
acne prone skin then I would definitely
suggest this one and this is great
because it gives you that coverage gives
you a flawless finish and it'll keep you
matte which means you're not gonna get
shiny throughout the day or oily or
anything like that and this is like $5
from Rimmel my second favorite is the
Physicians Formula mineral wear powder
foundation I'm obsessed with this stuff
if you've seen any of my recent videos
I'm probably using this this is great
for acne prone skin gives you good
coverage gives you an amazing finish
Physicians Formula is a little bit
pricier so I definitely recommend
waiting until they do buy one get one
free or buy one get one half off
that's just like a drugstore rule in
general never buy something completely
full price at the drugstore they rotate
around brands and it'll always go on
sale so just wait until these brands are
on sale and then stock up who feel like
I'm talking really fast right now powder
foundations what's next let's do blush
and bronzer for my favorite drugstore
bronzer it would be the NYC smooth skin
bronzing face powder I want to say this
retails for about three dollars it has
at finish it is perfect I wouldn't say a
bronzer is like a must in your drugstore
makeup starter kit but if you want to
get some contouring going on or you know
move up in the world go with the bronzer
wet-and-wild blushes are for sure my
favorite drugstore blushes they are
super pigmented they are amazing I'm
wearing it right now I wear it every
single day this is in pearlescent pink
pink
Heather silk is also amazeballs
whatever get it now that we got our face
done oh wait we don't have our face done
for a highlighter and if you don't want
to buy a separate bronzer blush and
highlight I would recommend the
Physicians Formula shimmer brick shimmer
strips in warm nude this is a fairly new
product I have a couple videos
mentioning it it is amazing because you
can use it on your eyes or face it has
shades for bronzing it has some middle
blush shades and then this shade up here
is a perfect highlight which means you
can put it down the bridge of your nose
on your cheekbones wherever you want to
highlight your face this is really great
if you don't want to spend you know
money on separate things kind of like an
all-in-one product right here and look
at the freakin packaging we got our face
done right yeah let's move on to eyes so
before you put any eyeshadow on your
eyes ladies please use an eye primer my
favorite drugstore eye primer is the why
did I just do that so awkwardly hard
candy eyeshadow primer you can get from
Walmart pretty much reminds me exactly
of the Urban Decay primer potion except
it's like five dollars instead of twenty
put this on before your eyeshadow is
going to help your eyeshadow stay
throughout the day it's going to make
the colors look more vibrant and
pigmented you need this then for
eyeshadows this was really tricky for me
to pick because I have a couple favorite
drugstore eyeshadow palettes but I think
this one takes the cake
this is the wet and wild oh god what
color is this even in it appears that
the color has been removed but this is
the wet and wild color icon collection I
mean just look for these colors you can
find it I want to say this retails for
like $4.99 but again you can get wet and
wild on sale they do a lot of 40% offs
this has eight shades in it which is
amazing
that price they're super pigmented
there's some really good shades in here
for everyday wear or definitely suggest
Maybelline or wet and wild eyes shadows
as far as eyeliner I have two options
one is a liquid and one is a pencil I
just do it the liquid eyeliner is the
Physicians Formula eye booster two and
one eyelash boosting serum my roommate
can't do a wing for I made her buy
this now she looks like a pro this is
super easy for creating a winged liner
or whatever kind of eyeliner you want it
stays all day it doesn't smudge it's
super black as far as a pencil liner
goes mine's looking a little bit ratchet
at the moment don't know where the cap
is this has been my go-to drugstore eye
liner for as long as I can remember this
is the L'Oreal carbon black extra
intense liquid pencil liner super black
doesn't move you can put on your
waterline for mascara I have to my first
is my go-to L'Oreal voluminous carbon
black mascara this is the best drugstore
mascara I've ever used it has more of a
wet formula
I like the waterproof just because I
live where it rains a lot and I you know
don't really want to deal with that I
don't think I'll ever use a different
drugstore mascara I know that sounds
dramatic but it's so true this one I use
for my bottom lashes it's the wet and
wild waterproof mega length mascara the
bristles are super small so it's easy to
get your bottom lashes you don't really
want to be going in with a brush like
this because it can get on your cheek
and it's just a mess that we want to
avoid again for lips I have way too many
drugstore lipsticks that I'm obsessed
with so let me know down below if you
want a separate video on that but I just
went with one this is for the person
that doesn't really wear makeup yet you
might be a teenager just starting to
wear makeup or you just don't like to
wear a lot of makeup so I went with the
Maybelline Baby Lips for this these have
pretty good color payoff this is from
the new limited edition collection I
will link it right here if you want to
see swatches of that but Maybelline has
a bunch of different baby lip shades
they're basically just like a tinted
chapstick they're super moisturizing so
I would go with this
for lips so that is it that is
everything that I would suggest if
you're just beginning with makeup
clearly you don't need to spend a
ton of money to create your makeup
collection or start out with makeup like
