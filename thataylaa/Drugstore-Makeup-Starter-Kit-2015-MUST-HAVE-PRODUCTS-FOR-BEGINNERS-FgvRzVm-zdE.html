my camera was charging I wish I were
joking Oh
kneeling on the floor right now I bet
half asleep we're just gonna get started
all right so today we have my drugstore
makeup starter kit 2015 edition I did
this video a year ago and it was one of
my most popular videos to date and you
guys seem to really like it so if you're
a beginner or just getting into makeup
or a teenager or whatever you are this
video is just intended to help with what
you need to get started kind of like the
basic drugstore items that I think you
need I would definitely suggest checking
out last year's video because I'm not
going to mention the stuff in that video
again but all those favorites are still
favorites and I still love those
products so these are kind of just more
products the D that came out this year
or that I didn't mention in last year's
video I have a whole box here before we
get started I did film a tutorial on
look I'm wearing right now this is a
fullface drugstore look so if you want
to know how to actually use the products
that you buy you can watch the tutorial
I'll link everything down below along
with all the products and all that good
stuff right so let's start out with
primers and primers are basically what
you put on your face before foundation
or any face products right after you
wash your face and moisturize I can't go
without wearing a primer on my face I
feel like it just creates a really nice
base for your makeup and helps to
minimize your pores and all that good
stuff and my favorite primer from the
drugstore has changed since last year my
new favorite is maybelline master prime
this is the blur and illuminate one I
think they have a redness correcting one
and another one I don't remember what it
is but these are great primers if you
like dewy skin you'll love this this
like radiates through your makeup
somehow and this has SPF 30 in it so
that's also a bonus another more recent
favorite is the LA girl Pro prep HD
primer this is a silicone based primer
so I don't like to wear this everyday
because I do feel like silicone based
primers break me out but I'm wearing it
right now and I just love the way that
it makes your foundation glide over top
most oh stuff can be found at Rite Aid
or CVS or Walgreens but some of the
stuff is it's exclude exclusive to Ulta
there we go so after your primer you're
going to go in with foundation which is
like all over kind of coverage they have
different kinds of coverage light/medium
of full coverage foundations and then
there's also things called BB Creams my
favorite drugstore BB cream by far is
illuminae by B cream this is SPF 20 I'm
the shade light I guess they make a fair
shade in Europe but I can't find it
anywhere in the US if you have this by
you oka sister oh this stuff is amazing
I do have to mix it with my Manic Panic
dreamtone this has great coverage the
finish is beautiful it's like a super
natural satiny kind of finish it stays
on all day it's a great option if you
don't want to wear a full-on foundation
as far as foundation goes from the
drugstore this is ridiculously hard for
me to choose I did just film a top pale
foundations video and a lot of those are
my favorite drugstore foundation picks
so I'll link that down below as well if
you want to watch that but I'm just
going to mention too in this video first
is Rimmel lasting finish 25 hour with
comfort serum I'm wearing it right now I
love the finish that this gives I am
pretty sure this breaks me out so I
don't use it on an everyday basis
anymore I don't use it on an everyday
basis anymore but this is an amazing
long lasting beautiful finish foundation
from the drugstore my other Holy Grail
foundation is Revlon Colorstay I've
talked about this 5 billion times as I
feel like every other Beauty person on
YouTube has but it's for a reason this
is definitely more of a full coverage
foundation I just have a pump on it from
BD MP looking for something with more
coverage and that's on the more matte
side check out this guy you won't be
disappointed brushes from the drugstore
I feel like are a whole other video but
I did want to mention that the Real
Techniques miracle complexion sponge is
amazing it's like 6 bucks from Ulta and
you can use it to apply your foundation
you just put this under water squeeze it
out and you're good to go
if you're just starting out and you
don't want to invest an expensive brush
or anything yet try out this thing and
it's like really addicting to squeeze
favorite drugstore powders haven't
changed too much in last year but this
one is a good option Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless that was cool this is
a powder foundation you can use it to
set your makeup so basically after you
put on your liquid foundation if you get
oily throughout the day you can
your foundation with the powder
something like this is great to control
the oil I typically don't set my
foundation with a powder just because I
use a setting spray this is the L'Oreal
infallible pro setting spray this came
out this year and it is freaking amazing
I think I've gone through like four or
five bottles of this already this is
hands-down my favorite setting spray
I've ever tried it keeps a makeup
looking good throughout the day adds
like a tiny bit of do to your face but
not where you look like super overly
shiny even if you do set your foundation
with a powder I would still recommend
using a setting spray it just kind of
helps to like sink the powder into your
face that did not sound appealing settle
the layers you know what I'm saying pour
blush bronzer and highlight there is one
trio that just does it all for me this
is the makeup revolution Ultra
brightening contour kit in the shade
ultra fair this just has a beautiful
bronzer highlight and blush literally
all three are great I'm wearing it on my
face today you'll see how to use these
if you watch that tutorial makeup
revolution as a super recently can be
found in Ulta stores I love this thing
this is great and if you don't want to
buy a separate blush bronzer and
highlight if you're just starting out
three and one another favorite blush is
the Milani rose powder blush this isn't
the shade TIROS these are just super
nice blushes not much to say about it
they are matte they have a good shade
range if you're new to drugstore makeup
trial Milani because they have a lot of
great stuff that's super affordable I'm
wearing their lip product right now oh
 forgot concealer alright we're
backtracking to concealer and they're my
new favorite drugstore concealer is the
Maybelline fit me concealer this
concealer is amazing super full coverage
blends out really nicely it isn't too
thick but it's also not like super thin
perfect consistencies is in the shade 15
which isn't the lightest shade but 15 is
actually lighter than 10 it's still a
little bit dark and when you first put
it on it looks super dark but once you
blend it out it somehow looks lighter
after I use my correcting powder by
Physicians Formula that I use in every
single video that lines up anything so
the color doesn't really matter to me as
much but if you want to lighten it up
you can use the NYX HD photogenic
concealer this is the lavender concealer
crap my battery's dying basically mix
this with any concealer or wear by
itself if you're super pale so before
you put on your eye
shadow you definitely want to put down
some kind of base whether it's a primer
or concealer or something I typically
like using my Mac painterly paint-pot
that a good drugstore option is the
color tattoo 24 hour if you can find a
light cream ish one that would be ideal
mine is like completely dried out but if
you don't have a primer you don't want
to spend the money on it you can always
use a concealer to start out a lot of
concealers do just as good of a job
drugstore eyeshadows are a little bit
trickier for me I have like a bunch of
single eyeshadows that I like from
random brands but not as many like full
palettes I do really like the chocolate
bar palette
I mean Naked chocolate palette by makeup
revolution I think these are like six to
nine dollars or something ridiculous
like that and they're beautiful to what
I'm wearing on my eyes right now makeup
revolution has some really awesome I
shadow my other favorite drugstore
eyeshadows are by L'Oreal and these are
just single shadows they're the
infallible line amber rush is beautiful
I have like ten shades of the super
pigmented have some nice shimmery
neutrals if you're just starting out
that can be a good thing to start with
if you just pop it on your lid with your
finger alright we're back seventeen
percent we're going to make this happen
we're just super zoom in had a one break
I do not remember what we were talking
about as far as mascara goes my favorite
drugstore mascara this year has been the
Maybelline lash sensational if you like
your lashes nice and curled this will do
it has a really nice comb kind of curved
brush another good one is Maybelline
falsies as well bottom lash mascara
hasn't changed
shocker if you've seen any of my videos
you probably saw me use this this is the
Wet n Wild mega length mascara is
perfect for getting the bottom lashes
you want to make sure you don't use a
brush like this on your bottom lashes
because it can transfer to your
concealer really easily especially if
you use a really wet formula this one
dries fairly fast it doesn't transfer
and it's great I'm going to pass through
my favorite liquid eyeliner really quick
because I mention it in every single
video and in the last video this is a
Physicians Formula
eye booster great for creating a super
quick wing if you're a beginner
amazeballs that's all I can say my
favorite eyeliner for the waterline is
the LA girl glide on gel liner this is
super black it actually stays on your
waterline
I think this is two or three dollars and
it's a really great Islander probably my
favorite I've ever tried from a
drugstore for lip products you don't
really need a lip liner there are
definitely lipstick so you can wear
without lip liners but if you're having
the issue where it's like feathering you
just can't get in the lines of your lips
try to lip liner
these are one or two dollars by essence
and they're great I get mine at Fred
Meyer but you can also get them at Alta
for just your basic lipstick my go-to is
the Milani I think these are color
sensational these are like the newer
ones the matte line from this year and
my favorite shade is matte naked I've
gone through two of these it's beautiful
 the camera batteries already
flashing their matte they stay on pretty
well for not being a long-lasting
lipstick and they're just a really great
basic kind of lipstick if you're looking
for one from the drugstore alright so
that was everything I hope I actually
remembered everything because my camera
is about to die in like two seconds
