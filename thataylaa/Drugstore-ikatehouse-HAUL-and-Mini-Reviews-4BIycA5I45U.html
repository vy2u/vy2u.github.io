energy right now so today I have a
massive massive haul for you guys went a
little crazy at the drugstore also got
some stuff from IKEA house combo if you
want to see what I got and you want to
hear my thoughts and many reviews on the
products that I've tried out then you
can keep watching if you wanna see a
video on the look I'm wearing right now
I have a whole get ready with me video
all I did for this video was switch up
the shirt and lip color right now I'm
wearing NYX lavender youtube tricks so
I'm gonna start out with the stuff from
my Kate house if you don't know what I
can't houses are basically an online
retailer for makeup they had a ton of
NYX LA girls stuff like that and they
contacted me and we're like hey do you
want to try out some stuff and I was
like yeah why not so all this stuff I
picked out on my own if you spend over
$39 you get free shipping which is
really cool so all this stuff will be
linked down below if you want to check
out any of it anyways let's do it so the
first thing I got is this NYX radiant
finishing powder I was thinking this was
kind of going to be comparable hopefully
to my physician's formula correcting
powder
unfortunately I don't think it is it
just doesn't and give the same effect as
the Physicians Formula one when you
blend it together you get kind of this
like pale correcting color powder like
you usually get but I don't know it
doesn't give the same finish and
coverage with the Physicians Formula one
Gibbs next I got the NYX liquid
illuminator if you follow my Instagram I
have been obsessed with this stuff this
is in the shade 0-1 Sunbeam this is just
a liquid highlighter basically I have it
on right now I used it in that get ready
with me video so if you want to see it
in action you can watch it there but
I've been really really loving this
stuff I talk more about it in that video
not gonna go too in depth about it that
video will be up after this by the way I
don't know if I said that next I picked
out this I don't really know why I did
it really appealed to me it kind of
remind me of the EOS lip-balm but in
Apple form kind of feel like it's no
white with it the smell is like a
mixture of apple and Grandma I don't
think I would put this on my lips but it
looks really cute and I'm gonna keep it
with my EOS lip balms in my little jar
thing over there I kind of want to get
the rest of them just so I can have a
collection of like mini plastic fruits
and next your thing is I got our lash
glue because you can never have enough
lash glue right they have tons of lashes
and stuff on there really cool brands
that I haven't heard of before so the
two lash glue is I got are just the
normal duo strip lash adhesive the
normal squeeze out kind and then the
brush on lash glue I use the brush on
lash glue today and I'm really liking it
it's kind of strange it brushes on a
blue color like literally the color of
my nails blue then it dries black and
it's just so much easier to apply just
brush it on your lashes it just makes
the whole lash process a lot easier next
two things I got our book from la girl
the first is this pro primer it appealed
to me because it was in stick form so
you literally just can you know pencil
this on your lids rub it in and you're
good to go
this was a very interesting product to
me I have never tried a primer quite
like this I can't even describe it it's
not even that it's sat on top it was
like it was two separate layers very
weird I'll probably be throwing this out
it was like a dollar wouldn't recommend
this this will probably be in my next
rejects video so then I got these two
pencils from she makeup I got a white
one and a black one their eye and lip
pencils I'm wearing the white one on my
eyes right now and I got the black one
because I didn't on the lookout for good
black lip liner really fill in the black
lips lately just very spring festive I
think these were like a dollar so super
affordable so far I really like the
white one stayed on my waterline haven't
had issues with it coming off the LA
girl Pro conceal concealer heard a lot
of makeup artist talk about this on
Instagram so I wanted to try it out I
don't like how it has a brush applicator
but you might be able to take it off
this is the
look at this this is literally like I
don't even know six shades too dark for
my skin it kind of shocked that this is
the lightest shade this is classic ivory
a little ridiculous this might be light
on like Snooki but not for this girl so
I've been mixing it in with NYX HD
concealer in lavender and I'm wearing it
right now so obviously I could make it
work I don't know how much you still get
out of this but the consistency and
coverage and everything was really nice
so the lashes I got from them are the
are gel natural Lucky's and also the
Ardell double-up lashes which I'm
wearing right now these were three note
to 0-5 and then the last two things I
got from there I feel like I'm
forgetting something I got this makeup
sponge I don't know why I haven't had
good luck with makeup sponges other than
my Real Techniques sponge which I have a
whole comparison video on which I'll
link down below if you want to see it
but I wanted to try this out because it
was pink and cute and then I got this a
neon ass pink nail polish looks like it
had a little spillage on the way I don't
know but it looked super neon and
appealing to me called
absolute with an exclamation point feel
like I'm on a caffeine high right now so
then I got a ton of stuff from Rite
Aid
I got makeup stuff and then a bunch of
just random stuffs thing is this Nair
shower power base spa I can't miss that
spot clay there we go with mango butter
and mineral rich clay
I thought the marketing this is kind of
deceiving it says this for the shower
but literally the only difference is
that you stand in the shower when
applying it you can't have water or
anything running across you it must be
dried before application the first time
I use this I waited like two minutes
because it says wait up at least a
minute and it didn't take off anything
second time I did it I waited like five
minutes and it took stuff off but I
don't think this works nearly as well as
the feet spray on stuff the only thing
is this smells good like this does not
smell like in there at all it has a tiny
bit of hair removal scent if you note
I'm talking about but it's not like holy
 smells like rotten eggs so when I
went to Rite Aid all L'Oreal stuff was
40% off so exciting had to stock up on
stuff the first thing I got is my
L'Oreal magic Lumi primer I used this a
while ago then I
out and I didn't get around to
repurchasing it I think I was kind of
just waiting for it to go on sale again
I love this primer it's great for making
your makeup stay on longer
not so much minimizing pores that
definitely helps the lasting power and
if you like a dewy kind of luminous glow
then you would definitely like this
primary the only thing is the smell it
smells a little bit chemically but I can
live with it
next I got the new miss manga L'Oreal
mascara comment down below if you guys
want to see a get ready with me or
something first impression type of video
using this stuff I know a lot of people
are talking about it right now haven't
tried it out yet obviously but look at
the packaging a plus on packaging I
guess we'll just stick with L'Oreal
stuff while we're on a roll I got two
more of the L'Oreal infallible
eyeshadows these are great pigmented
eyeshadows some probably some of my
favorite eyeshadows from the drugstore
so the first color I got is 892 amber
rush I haven't tried it out yet so I'll
swatch it for you guys it looks like
this whoa super pigmented you literally
don't even have to rub your finger in it
there you go
super pretty like rose gold shade I was
thinking that this would go good with
the revealed 2 palette the other Shana
got is 755 gilded Envy I don't think
I've ever seen a shade quite like this
that's a little bit of all of the green
undertones in it look at that so unique
there's that shade right there feel like
this would go good with the Naked 2
palette colors so then I had to try out
the new Maybelline Dream pure BB cream
this says it has 2% salicylic acid in it
and it's supposed to be a skin clearing
Perfector I've used this a few times now
it has majorly broken me out you guys
can't tell right now because I'm wearing
full coverage foundation but I do have
some major cystic acne going on on my
chin and it was definitely from this
stuff because this was the only thing
different that I've been using skin has
been clear for like a month now so this
definitely broke me out which I was not
expecting since it is supposed to be a
clearing treatment has salicylic acid
don't ask me how it broke me out I think
there's something in BB Creams
doesn't agree with my skin because
literally every single BB cream I've
ever tried has broken me out if you want
to see a whole review on it let me know
down below and we can do that next I got
this Ecotools mini essentials set comes
with a powder brush kind of small
eyeshadow brush and then an angled brush
that you can use for liner or your brows
I've been really liking it for my brows
let's see if I can find it so here's the
brow brush this is what I've been using
for my brows every day I think this was
like five dollars that's a super good
deal for three brushes and I actually
like the small handed brushes small
handed brushes so my trying to say small
handles on brushes because it's easier
to travel with so then I got another one
of my suave keratin infusion dry shampoo
they came out with a new one for colored
hair but I just wanted to stick with
this one because I like the scent and
formula and everything of this this has
been my lifesaver I can literally go
five days without washing my hair which
I know is gross to some of you but I
don't care my hair doesn't really get
that oily until like the fourth day why
I wash it when you can have volume and
dry shampoo my roommate has super
 oily hair and this completely
controls it for her the key with this is
you have to really work it into your
hair so if you've tried this before and
you didn't like it try it and I like
section it off spray it and then really
work it into my roots and I get volume
and it completely controls the oil so I
really like this stuff the last thing I
got is some axe excite from vitalizing
shower gel I don't know I just ran out
of my shower gel I'm using right now and
this smells so good it smells like a
combo of man and vanilla or something
kind of a little bit ambry it doesn't
smell like overpowering man yeah not
much to say about this but it smells
damn good so that is everything that I
got all the links will be down below
