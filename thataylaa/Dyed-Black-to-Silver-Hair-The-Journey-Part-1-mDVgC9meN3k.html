its thing what are you doing up there
man who knows all right so today we're
going to be talking about the process of
going from black to silver I kind of
just randomly had this idea one I was
like looking at photos of hair when I
get an idea that I want to do something
I get like addicted to it and I have to
do it like the next day so basically I
did a ton of research that night I was
up till like 3:00 a.m. I did ton of
research myself figured out what I
wanted to do and then that next day
called this lawn and started the process
want to basically be like a platinum
silver and in order to achieve that you
have to literally get your hair to white
before you can reap it on a dye so
basically I decided to do the first part
at home and then I went to the salon to
start the actual like hardship I've
gotten a ton of requests from you guys
to document this whole process not just
like the end result couldn't find a
video that really took you through all
the steps if you want to do it in like a
safe healthy way for your hair so I
figured I would document this whole
process so you guys can follow along
this is a journey this isn't going to
happen overnight if you're expecting it
to happen overnight good luck you might
not have hair just need to throw it out
there I'm not a hair stylist I do not
have extensive knowledge about hair this
is just what I've learned after
researching myself and experimenting and
going to a salon and just things that
I've learned so this is the way I'm
doing it you've gone through this before
if you have any recommendations or
knowledge in this area definitely feel
free to leave a comment down below so I
hope this helps them you guys are either
debating dyeing your hair lighter from
Black Bloc is the hardest dye to remove
especially if you have years and years
and years of it built up on your hair so
if you're new here I've had dyed black
hair for as long as I've been on YouTube
there was like a break in-between where
I had red hairs left purplish hair for a
little bit but for the most part I've
had dyed black hair for almost ten years
now my natural hair color is strawberry
blonde I don't know if you'll be able to
see in this lighting but you can see my
roots coming in right now this is
actually my natural hair
color it's a lot lighter than this I
haven't had it that color for years I
don't know remember what it looks like
to be honest so basically I have years
of box black dye on my hair and if
you've had hair on your hair on your dye
if you've had diner hair and you're
playing going from dark to light
aka you'll need to bleach your hair most
likely I found a best use a color
remover at home first
most ones don't typically use Movers
because you have to do it a few times
and it smells horrible
so what haircolor removers do is
basically remove the hair color from
your hair if you've only dyed your hair
a few times it'll probably take it close
to your natural color if you have years
of box Dioner hair like I did it'll help
take out some of it but it's obviously
not going to strip out all of that color
so I use two different color removers
and I did it twice obviously the first
one I used was the color fix I believe
it's called and that when I don't have
the box for anymore but that one I
forgot to share about a year and a half
ago I wanted to do a dark blue color and
so I used a color remover on my hair and
it literally got my hair to about this
color so I was kind of expecting it to
get back to this color when I used a
color remover at this time this time
when I use that color remover it did not
get nearly as light as what it was
before it basically made my roots fiery
because you have the least amount of
hair dye up here and then the ends were
basically still totally dark
there is no bleach in color remover so I
decided after reading online to go in
with another color remover and this is
the color oops
extra-strength and if you're going to
choose a color remover I would go this
one this time this one worked way better
on my hair it still didn't get it to
this color at all it basically got it to
like dark brown shade so it did strip
some of the black but it didn't get it
as light as it did previously but this
is ammonia free and bleach free leave it
on for 20 minutes with color removers
you want to make sure that you read all
the directions go on Amazon read people
suggestions you basically want to make
sure that you get all of it out like
wash your hair literally for like 20
minutes afterwards because if you don't
the color can come back in a couple days
when it like oxidizes so I read that you
want to
a few days or a week if you can between
using color remover and using any kind
of dye or bleach or anything on your
hair so if you're booking an appointment
for going to a hair salon make sure they
book it out a few days to a week I think
I waited three days between the time
when I had color remover on my hair and
went to the salon so basically I had
like super fiery roots for a couple days
I just wore a hat not a big deal so then
on to the salon so the salon I'm going
to is Ross Michael salon in Bremerton if
you look at their Instagram which I'll
link down below because it's amazing
they specialize in like silver and
fantasy hair and it's actually like I
have to take a freaking ferry to this
place it's a process but it's worth it
because they do such amazing work and
just looking at their Instagram I
instantly knew like that's where I
wanted to go if you're doing any kind of
major color correction which is
basically what it is like so on charge
you for color correction make sure
you're going somewhere that has
experience doing that that uses olaplex
that's a big tip I have find this long
that uses old Plex if they don't what
are they doing olaplex basically helps
to make your hair less damaged when
you're using bleach they like mix it in
also just be aware that it's a freaking
pricey process since they bill you per
hour most salons for color correction
that can be anywhere from seventy sixty
dollars to like $150 an hour and I was
in there for I think five hours so just
be aware that if you're going to have to
do that a few times is going to be
pricey in my opinion is worth it if you
really want it because you don't want to
fry your hair off at home that they know
what they're doing and you could do it
at home but I've tried that like when I
went red and stuff before and it's just
not worth the stress and then like
having to go to a salon to have them
correct it and worrying about frying
your hair off to me it's just not worth
it obviously it's a process you're not
going to do this overnight any of the
videos that say you can do this
overnight just be cautious you want to
keep your hair intact because I'll show
you what happens when you over bleach
your piece hair
it's not pretty it's not just that your
hair is dry it's like
hair is literally unmanageable and like
spaghetti noodle basically what they did
at the salon is bleached it with olaplex
did some belly aaj and then toned it and
I used a few different shades of toner
my hair pulls super brassy every single
time I try to bleach it or lighten it so
I kind of had a feeling that was going
to happen I personally hate brassy tones
but I know it's like part of the process
so in this light it's a little bit hard
to see what the hair actually looks like
I'm going to insert a clip right here of
filming and natural lighting for my
Jaclyn hill collection video tutorial
thing that I did that's what it looks
like in natural lighting I'm also going
to insert a clip right now of what it
looks like literally outside as you can
see in the Sun and then like totally
natural lighting outside it is super red
but for going for pretty much years of
died box black dye to this I was super
happy I didn't think it was going to get
that light especially the back section
got super light which I'm going to talk
about neck underneath we actually got
full-on blonde as you can see right here
it is pretty much blonde and I have been
using a blue shampoo to help tone out
some of the orange miss thanks to your
guys recommendations I've been using the
joy code blue shampoo which I'm gonna
link everything I'm talking about
okay just had to change my memory card
but we are back so basically what I
think happened is I had a lot less dye
on the back of my hair because that's an
area that I can't easily reach myself
and I just didn't dye that much when I
would dye my hair myself I mostly did it
on the roots and then like the front
area because that's where you see so
basically this whole top part of my hair
feels totally healthy and it's just like
a lighter shade of brown underneath got
pretty fried so it's not just dry
basically what happens when your hair is
like totally over bleached it gets gummy
and that has been a challenge when I
shower when I wet my hair it literally
turns into like spaghetti turns into
this gum
material you can't brush through it you
can't style it you're supposed to
basically just like leave it there so
what I did after that at home was used a
protein treatment the apogee I think
that's a safe OG to set protein
treatment has the best reviews I've used
it in the past before right after dying
so what it does is protein it's like
straight-up protein so your hair gets
super crispy and it basically helps to
like restore the protein molecules in
your hair so as far as I could tell from
what I learned if you put that on
healthy pieces of hair you can kind of
have like reverse effects your hair
basically has too much protein in it it
can break easier and protein build up is
really hard to get rid of what happened
with that is that I put it mostly on the
underneath section of my hair and this
part felt a little bit dry so I like
added some into this part and I left it
on for about an hour and a half I don't
know if that was too long or what but it
basically made this part of my hair got
me so this part feels totally healthy
but like when it's wet this part is now
gummy basically be careful if you use a
protein treatment you're going through
this process you basically want to like
leave your hair be the try not to use
heat use coconut oil and hair masks I'm
using the old plex number three once a
week but try and wash your hair as
little as possible please let me know
down below if you have any suggestions
for getting rid of the gummy hair mmm
yeah that's what's been going on with my
hair if you want to follow along with
the process make sure you're following
