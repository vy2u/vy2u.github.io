real
all right so today we are going to be
talking all about wings one of the
hardest things in my opinion to do
especially if you have closed lids if
you don't have hooded lids this
technique will definitely still work for
you it'll probably just look 50 times
better must be nice so I feel like over
the years how I do my winged liner has
been one of my most asked questions and
I finally wanted to sit down do a video
on it and just do a very basic talk
through explanation basically what I do
with hooded lids the goal is to get them
as even as possible the reality is that
they're never going to be perfect I'm
not perfect that winged liner by any
means I'm just sitting in a room talking
to myself showing you guys what I do I
feel like I've found a technique that
works really well once you practice all
this makeup is practice life is practice
that just got deep I look exactly the
same right now because I just did a
video on Clarisonic brush head so if you
want to see me test out this foundation
brush rotating thing it's a good time
that video will be linked down below in
the description box pre filming for
while I'm in China I'll be there when
you guys are seeing this the two videos
in one day kind of week so hope this was
helpful for you let's just jump into it
I feel like add something else will tell
you guys the two products that I'm using
this video our drugstore I've been using
this product for years I prefer it over
high-end eyeliners have tried this
eyeliner is just my child so if you've
seen any of my videos you know that my
Holy Grail eyeliner is a Physicians
Formula
eye booster eyeliner in the shade ultra
black if your going to pick this up make
sure you get the ultra black shade
because just the black shade is pretty
shitty have a new one in box right here
to show you here's the one I usually use
they look the same so when you're
picking it up just double check the
shade right here says ultra black if you
can tell I have lash extensions right
now hence what my lashes are already
done in my time when I'm filming this I
just got them done a few days ago so I
actually haven't applied eyeliner with
them on yet so we'll see how this goes
I'm just going to do my normal technique
it's pretty much the same as applying
eyeliner if you have mascara on already
or like false lashes if you just have
your normal lashes on no lash extensions
or anything you want to put on your
eyeliner after your eye shadow and
before your mascara so everything except
my eyeliner right now is basically done
I'm going to be putting some bottom lash
mascara on but I always do that after
eyeliner as well so I'm gonna actually
use the new one today
why not obviously depending on how much
you wear liquid liner I usually wear it
a few times a week and these pens last
me a while for liquid liner I would say
a a couple months before you start to
see the pigment kind of go away so it's
kind of when you know you're getting to
the end for me when it starts fraying a
little bit I usually get this just right
on the end like right before I toss it
so it shouldn't get annoying and fray
right when you first start using it this
one isn't a super matte black but it is
very black it stays on it's quick it
rains a shit-ton in Seattle and I never
have my eyeline or anything running all
over my face I find that it applies
pretty well over shimmer eyeshadows
sometimes that can be an issue with
eyeliner you don't get like the full
pigment when you put it over shimmer do
you find that with the certain eyeshadow
you're not getting the blackest black I
like to create the shape with this and
then you can even go over it with a
different eyeliner just on the parts
where it might not be covering the
shimmer but for basic everyday quick
easy wings this is definitely my
favorite liner I found so I first get it
I like to shake it just to make sure all
the products getting down there so the
applicator on this is brush tip it's
super smooth it's not going to have that
drag that some eyeliners do it says that
it's long wearing water-resistant and
smudge resistant which I agree with
it also says this is supposed to help
grow your lashes I've been using this
for years and my natural lashes are
pretty long I don't know if this has had
something to do with it I don't think
it's dramatically growing my lashes but
it could be helping who knows so the
best tip I have for you if you're just
starting out with the winged liner is to
practice at night before you get in the
shower or wash your face when I first
start getting into makeup that's what I
used to do you can look a little wild
because you're just going to wash it off
like anything practice can never hurt so
something to consider before you go in
for your wing is definitely your eye
shape we all have different eye shapes
winged liner is one of those things that
looks totally different depending on
your eye shape you're going to need to
do something different if you have
hooded lids versus if you have more lid
space or if you have mono lids I
personally have hooded lids which means
that my lids right here kind of overhang
so even if I'm creating a straight line
when my eyes are closed it looks totally
straight if I open my eyes it'll look a
bit different I also have two different
eye shapes which most of us do were not
perfectly symmetrical but I do have to
do my wings a little bit different on
each eye to get the same kind of look
when my eyes are open it can be really
frustrating to kind of figure out that
right shape and I'm still not perfect on
it sometimes my eyeliner looks great
sometimes it looks like total you
have a lot of lid space and you don't
have hooded lids trying to think of
someone who nikkietutorials for example
she has great lid space if you have
those kind of eyes I'm jealous because I
shadow eyeliner automatically looks 50
times better because you don't have
anything causing it to change shape
basically when I do winged liner I
typically find it easiest to be really
close to a mirror so I'm just going to
bring this forward sorry sand frame but
we're just gonna have to deal with it I
have a standing mirror on my wall that
I'll usually stand right up against I
feel like I get the best wing doing that
for some reason versus like sitting
let's pray to the winged liner gods hope
we have a good day so I would say
there's like three main steps to doing
the wing that I do which is first
creating the base I'm basically going to
draw a line from depending on how
dramatic you want your eye you can start
all the way on the inner corner or you
can start about halfway I typically like
Mike's listen you guys off I typically
like to start about here so what we're
going to do is create the base then I'm
going to draw a line out and then
basically connect a triangle so let's do
this I'm probably not gonna be able to
talk as I do it I also have not tried
this with the lash extensions so fingers
crossed when you get a new one you might
want to just do a few strokes just to
get all the color out with this base
line right here I'm literally just
putting it right against my lash line so
you don't want there to be any kind of
gap between your lashes and the line if
you have a really wobbly hand you can
stabilize it by putting your elbow on a
desk the great thing about this liner is
that you don't get that weird drag where
it causes it to almost be like jaggedy
this just is a really smooth line you're
gonna have to figure out how far on your
eye you want to pull this out wherever
you end that line is where you're going
to start the wings to make your eyes
look bigger you can pull it out farther
and kind of create the illusion of
having a bigger eye than you do if you
have hooded lids you want to be careful
because when I do that it can basically
make the line look not straight because
it starts to Sag a little bit so I'm
just going to pull down right to where
my bottom lash line meets the top
another thing to be careful of is you
don't want to pull it down too far
that's going to make your eyes look a
little bit more droopy you just kind of
want to keep it in line and if anything
a little bit more out than down so the
other awesome thing about this eyeliner
is that it obviously has a super fine
point which is awesome for creating the
wing now on to the actual wing part
which can be the trickier part for me
the key with this is applying pressure
at the base and then lightly kind of
flicking it out so if you think about
almost like painting if you want to fade
something you're going to apply the most
pressure at the bottom and then just
fade it out and you
less pressure if you've never done this
before you can practice on your hand so
just practice applying pressure and then
letting go goal is to get it to be the
blacks at the bottom and then a
centerline at the top that's essentially
what I'm going to be doing on my eye so
what I just did is started right at the
base where that first line ended it does
to you how far you want to pull up this
line this is going to be the end of your
wing so if you want more of a natural
smaller wing you're not going to want to
pull it up this far but keep in mind
wherever the halfway point is that's
basically where I'm going to be
connecting the line to create kind of a
triangle and that's what's actually
going to create the wing so now that I
have this fairly straight line right
here to create the actual wing I'm not
starting right at the end because that's
going to create a really thick triangle
you want the end of your wing to be that
nice thin line so basically I'm going to
start about halfway in this line and I'm
literally just going to drag it down in
one motion for me I find that that's
what creates the easiest wing if you
start and stop and start and stop it's
just going to be really hard to get that
smooth wing you can always go back in
clean it up adjust it if you mess up
it's actually really hard for me to see
with these lashes so I hope it's going
to turn out okay
can't really see the line right now I
can only see my lashes as you can see
there's a triangle kind of shape that
isn't filled in yet so this is going to
be the top of the wing now that I have
the basic kind of triangle shape just
going to go in and fill it in I just
ended that about halfway in the reason
why I do that and not all the way into
where we started is that then I have one
more time to kind of go over it and make
sure the line is smooth from where I
started if you pull it all the way in
and you need to build it up more you're
going to have to think of a wing if that
makes sense so I'm just going to go
ahead and fill this in you can go either
direction whatever is easiest for you
it's just like coloring you just want to
fill in between the lines so now that I
have that filled in you can see when I
have my eyebrows up and my lids aren't
hooded the line is a lot straighter
right here then when I let my eye sag
you can kind of see it like droops right
there sewing is also a little bit more
droopy that's just my eye shape that's
what happens so now what I'm going to do
is create the final kind of smooth over
where I go back and right where we first
started right about here and I'm just
going to try and do one swift line to
kind of
smooth out that top and make sure it's
really nice and even this is definitely
a lot easier to do if you don't have
lashes and that's pretty much all I do
when I'm not talking through they can do
it a lot quicker it usually takes me
about 30 seconds you can always go in
with a q-tip or a little makeup wipe and
just clean up the edges or even use some
concealer to I'm going to show you guys
how to do that with some concealer my
outside line right now isn't horrible
but it definitely could be a little bit
straighter best drugstore concealer I've
found to do this is the wet and wild
come correct just because it's very
pigmented and it has a little bit more
of a stiff formula what it uses for
underneath your eyes I basically just
like to use this to spot conceal and to
clean up certain areas so this is
actually a super old brush this is a six
plus I got this from eBay years ago I've
just always used it more if you make
similar brushes to this so don't Elise
make similar brushes so I'll leave a few
options down below so you don't want to
go concealer overload I just have a tiny
bit and I was going to basically clean
up this outer line just so it's super
sharp just so you can see where you're
starting you can keep your eye open and
then as you drag it up you can just
close your eye and do that in one kind
of motion again and then I just like to
feather this out so there's not a stark
line right there and just blend it out
with your finger a little bit alright so
I'm going to attempt to do the same
exact thing on the other eye
wish me luck since my eyes are different
shapes this line I kind of just have to
eyeball it how far to pull it out that's
going to make it look even I almost
always like the way that this eye looks
better than this side just because I do
have more lid space right here oh and an
entire lash just came off sweet
typically only is the concealer if I
have to to clean it up but just to even
out both sides also an with concealer as
well do my bottom lashes on camera I
just use the Wet n Wild mega link
mascara it's my favorite for the bottom
lashes doesn't transfer onto concealer
has really easy one just for getting in
there since it's smaller so that's
pretty much all I do like I said when
I'm not filming this takes me way less
time I feel like this eyeliner makes
life 5,000 times easier if you haven't
tried it give it a try
