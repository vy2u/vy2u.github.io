today it's a problem
all right so today we're gonna be doing
a sponge comparison video I have two
drugstore sponges here one of them has
been around for a long time like years
now this is the Real Techniques miracle
complexion sponge I've gone through lots
of these over the years this is just a
new one just for the sake of the video
and this has a little carrying case
which I thought was pretty sweet we can
also use an Easter egg
I've seen people do that I do think this
is a great sponge I'm not someone who is
a die-hard Beauty Blender person or
anything I actually prefer this sponge
over the Beauty Blender whoa almost fell
off the chair but I wanted to try out
this fairly new sponge I think it's out
within the last couple months from
Ecotools I have their perfection blender
duo because I wanted to also try out
this one for concealer but if you didn't
want to get the duo this is their face
bunch that they sell on its own too you
can get both these Ulta or most
drugstores they're super minimal claims
on both of these because I mean they're
sponges but I'm going to read a couple
things off the Voltas website tell you
the prices and everything just so we can
compare and then I'm gonna use these to
put foundation on my face and concealer
by the way I have a giant bowl of water
here which is slightly frightening with
like ten electronics on this desk so I
start out with the ecotools blending duo
you can get this for $9.99 on ulties
website to get this sponge only it's
$5.99 on Ulta it says the larger base
blender which is the darker green is
soft and flexible to create light
buildable makeup application the mini
detailed Blender is firmer for more
precise and detailed coverage so I might
use that to spot conceal to well think
about this is that it's made of 70%
plant-based materials it's cruelty free
so the Real Techniques sponge if you get
this case with it is $6.99 and if you
get the sponge only it's $5.99 sometimes
Target and Ulta does like the double
sponge deals where it's a little bit
cheaper could get two sponges so sponges
latex for you I'm gonna talk more about
the shapes when I'm actually going
through the application sponges you can
typically use damp and dry I definitely
prefer them damp for a liquid foundation
application I only like using sponges
dry for powder if I'm like using it to
powder my under eyes or to really pack
on face powder I like doing that
technique with the Maybelline loose fit
me matte poreless powder I have a whole
video a bunch of videos using that
powder actually so I'm taking these out
it's cool that these sponges alone are
the same price both $5.99
in this case this feels fancy whoa and
it says you want to let your sponge dry
before you put it in the case if you're
traveling obviously you don't want it to
get like moldy and stuff in there it's
got a really really great visual image
of a moldy sponge we're gonna talk about
this one afterwards but for liquid
foundation I'm gonna use these two
sponges one on each half my face to
apply I feel like most people have seen
the Real Techniques sponge but it
basically just has this pointed tip and
then you have a flat edge right here you
could also use this part to apply your
foundation but whenever I use this bunch
I definitely prefer to use this flat
edge for the Ecotools sponge you have
kind of a longer flat side right here
and then you have a shorter flat side on
the other end that's pretty cool because
you could use that flat side if you
wanted and also instead of a point right
here like the Real Techniques you have
this flat edge so that is kind of like
the Sephora cake and baked sponge you
could use that to get right underneath
your eye or clean up your concealer or
something and then you have a round
bottom so Real Techniques doesn't really
have a round bottom at all you have the
round side this one has almost like a
Beautyblender round bottom to it so I
really like that they have so many
different edges to this so squeezing
them without dampening it they feel
almost exactly the same as far as like
squishiness and the outer material feels
really similar this one might be a tiny
bit softer
I don't know I'm smelling these right
now but neither of them has a scent all
right should we take a dip I'm getting
flashbacks to the damn sue John sue
video where I dunked my whole face in a
bowl of water this large of a bowl
probably wasn't necessary for this video
so I've already washed moisturize and
prepped both of my skins both sides of
my face
I think I might ride the Ecotools on
this side Real Techniques on this side
whenever I dampen my sponges I kind of
give them a few squeezes they actually
seem to get big right at the same time
they feel almost identical so once I let
them totally soak up the water
I completely trying not to get water on
my Mike right now I completely squeezed
them out like that and then I use a
towel to get the rest of the water out
you definitely don't want any water
dripping on your face because it'll just
mix with the foundation weird it looks
like there's more water coming out of
the Real Techniques Ecotools kind of dun
dripping and Real Techniques right here
is still going I'm just going to take a
towel let's kind of squeeze out the
this water so now that these are
dampened here are the sizes both of them
got quite a bit bigger I feel like the
Ecotools got a little bit more plump I'm
gonna do a squeeze with equal pressure
on both sides trying to see how you guys
can see this okay so in my hands they
feel equally squishy Ecotools might be a
tiny bit squishier actually whoops both
of them feel soft for foundation I've
been in love with the way that this
makes my skin look lately this is the
dermablend smooth liquid camo foundation
I have a whole video on this during one
of the 15 days foundation I think it was
fly to shade is too dark and very yellow
so I do have to mix it so I'm gonna mix
in just a tiny bit of dermal called 208
but this foundation if your dry skin is
bomb I think I want to start out with
this flat edge because that's typically
how I use the Real Techniques so let's
see Oh feels super soft that flat edge
right there is really nice for getting
in the crease of your nose like I just
did let's use it to go right under the
eye take a look at that combo I feel
like this kind of smells like carrots it
might be the foundation no I think it's
a sponge having a little trouble getting
right there so I'm gonna put just a tiny
bit of foundation right on the flat edge
there we go
well look at that that looks beautiful
that took about 15 seconds tops so for
this half of my forehead I want to try
this round bottom like I said typically
I don't like the round kind of sponges I
mean that worked great - I just got a
foundation in my hair that looks
beautiful I really like that I could use
that to get in like the crevice of my
nose and I could see this being awesome
if you are someone who applies your
eyeshadow first and then you like to
kind of clean it up with concealer this
flat edge I mean you could just glide it
right under there in this smaller sponge
which we're gonna try for concealer also
has that it's just smaller let's do the
real techniques I have a ton of videos
using this sponge kind of older ones
because
I really liked the morphe sponge that
got discontinued don't buy all of their
sponges because the one that I used to
use with the super pointy tip is the
only one that I recommended it's
different than the other ones lately
I've been really liking this la girl
sponge which is shaped exactly like the
Real Techniques one but I don't know
I've just kind of been wanting to find
another easily accessible kind of
drugstore one like the Real Techniques
one I feel like I'm getting lighter
coverage on this side I'm still going
from the same amount of foundation so I
didn't remix it or anything yeah it does
look a little bit lighter coverage I
think I got a little bit more full
coverage on that side
this sponge sounds very spongy they both
look super smooth and I feel like this
site actually looks a little bit more
dewy could be because this one didn't
retain quite as much water this one does
feel a little bit drier but this one
doesn't feel too wet it just feels nice
and damp right now off of this use I
like this one a little bit more but
let's see how the small sponge does so
I'm gonna dampen this right now this one
just feels really nice like I want to
keep using it
I want another face oh that almost just
landed on my blog camera but here's the
small sponge damp compared to the big
one it's actually not that much smaller
I mean it's smaller but it's not like
the mini Beauty Blender small or
anything this one you could honestly use
for your face too if you wanted to so
I'm gonna go ahead and apply under-eye
concealer I'm gonna use the Tarte shape
tape and then add a little bit of the
Maybelline fit me just to add some
moisture in there and we're gonna try
blending it out with the sponge I don't
usually use a sponge to blend out my
concealer because I find that it just
gives me not as much coverage as using
my fingers or a brush but there are
times where I'm just feeling lazy and I
just use the same sponge to blend out my
concealer so it's the same kind of thing
like I said since we have this smaller
edge I'm going to try this one and then
I might try the other edge for the other
side super easy to get right underneath
your lash line yeah if you were cleaning
up I shadow or something you can get
that line again easy to get right in the
corner I actually feel like I got better
coverage than I you
really do when I tried to do that with a
sponge I'm gonna try just for shits and
giggles the round side I don't know why
you would use the round side if there's
a flat side but we got this bunch here
so definitely harder to get right
underneath there so I'm gonna switch to
now this side that we haven't used yet
which is basically the same as the first
one just longer I definitely like the
way this small flat edge side applied it
the best I would use that again to blend
that out
that looks pretty pretty great right now
both the concealer and the foundation
I'm liking the Ecotools side better I
talked about this before 50 million
times but I've weird under eyes
I don't bake baking doesn't work for me
I don't like using loose powders under
there so I'm not gonna be using a loose
powder under there but I do want to try
it with the powder because I'm sure a
lot of you guys will want to use this
for powder if you are someone who likes
to apply your powder that way so this is
slightly damp ideally this would be dry
if you're gonna use it with powder but
this side especially really isn't that
damp at all right now do we find so I'm
just gonna go in with my usual under-eye
setting powders which will be linked
down below and I'm gonna use the smaller
side
he's our pressed powder so I'm kind of
just like swirling in both of them and I
was gonna press this in let's see how it
goes I really like this small flat side
if this totally works if you're someone
who likes using a sponge I mean the
shape of this and everything definitely
works alright so I'm gonna wrap up the
rest of my makeup real quick and I'll be
back to tell you guys my final thoughts
okay so the rest of my makeup is on I'm
gonna tell you super quick what I used
for bronzer I use the elf bronzing
palette this shade right here for blush
I use the H&amp;amp;M why did I put all this way
cantaloupe which I've been really diggin
lately or a face highlight and then also
for my inner corner I used hourglass
metallic strobe lighting palette my
obsession it's just super basic eyes
buddies the hooded Beauty desert dust
palette I just used desert sand and musk
which are these first two shades right
here my usual mascaras which will be
linked down below and then for lips I
use the AR del matte whipped and
smokin'-hot I mentioned this in my
favorite red liquid lipsticks video and
that's that my shirt and jewelry like
always will be linked down below
alright so my quick final thoughts on
both these sponges I'm really leaning
towards the
the Eco tools I really like how it has
the two different edges and the bottom
if you're like a Beautyblender kind of
person and you're into that it feels
almost exactly like the Real Techniques
sponge you basically just get more sides
to work with so if you like the Real
Techniques sponge you might really like
this Bunge I also do think like I said I
got a bit better coverage with this
sponge I feel like it just retained the
water a little bit better which sounds
like it could be a bad thing because
it's wetter but it just soaks up less of
your foundation I feel like so I don't
know I'm really feeling this one I'm
gonna keep using this you'll probably
see this in upcoming foundation Friday's
and everything so if you're in the
market for a new sponge or if you're
Real Techniques or one of your other
sponges is on its last limbs I think
it's worth giving this one a go so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
did make sure you give it a thumbs up I
realized I didn't do really any kind of
intro like I usually do but if you're a
new here you can join the baby toe
family and subscribe I upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday at 6 p.m.
Pacific time I'll pop in my social media
