all right so today is the first day of
15 days of foundation it's going to be
series where every single day for 15
days I test out a new foundation and do
a new first impression to show you guys
foundations I'm trying out in the next
15 days are ones that are either super
requested by you guys we're hyped up on
YouTube or ones that you guys have
tweeted me or commented that you want to
be a part of this series I am completely
a foundation a hoarder I have an entire
drawer dedicated only to foundations
I love testing out new foundations it's
really difficult to find a good coverage
pale skin foundation so if you also have
pale skin I feel you the struggle is
real I have a whole playlist for pale
skin so I hope this series and my
channel help some of you guys who are
also going through that the foundation
game is a lot stronger than it was four
years ago when I started all this there
is hope 15 days the foundation is going
to be July 5th to the 20th
I am pre recording a few of these videos
because I'm going to be gone in San
Diego during right smack during the
middle of this so whoa this was totally
just unscrewed so the first foundation
that we're starting out with is the LC
micro silk foundation this is one of
those foundations that I've always been
super curious about but I've never
gotten around to trying just because
it's not available on Sephora a
Nordstrom anything like that you can get
it on Namie's or you can get it on the
LC website dropped in he'll mention this
foundation in a video like a year ago
and it blew the up so I'm excited
to see how this works for me if you're
excited about this areas make sure you
use the hashtag 15 AIDS Foundation on
social give this video a thumbs up cause
this whole series I'm going to leave my
skin type and everything like that in
the description box I'm also going to
leave the foundation that I'm trying out
that day and the link to previous days
in this series so this foundation
retails for $45 so definitely a pricier
foundation it does have a glass bottle
in its one fluid ounce there are twelve
different shades the lightest shade is
porcelain which I have and just reading
the description on their website it says
it's a lightweight yet buildable HD
coverage liquid foundation made for
every skin type leaving the face to feel
flawless smooth and hydrate
long lasting water-resistant and a mild
transfer-resistant so basically not
transfer-resistant I know how you can be
mildly transfer resistant either you
transfer Udo it's non-comedogenic vegan
paraben free gluten free cruelty free
it's like in any of my foundation videos
we're gonna put this bad boy on wear it
throughout the day do a few check-ins I
typically like to leave my foundation on
for at least eight or nine hours to give
it a good wear test if you want to see
what I think of the LC microcell
foundation you're in the right place
just watchin I am pumped I just whipped
out a new Real Techniques sponge look
how freakin big this thing is I feel
like this one's bigger than my old one
it's nothing like a new sponge I also
have the morphe g36 brush right here
that I'm going to try on one side of my
face for all these videos we're going to
be doing a Beauty Blender on one side
and brush on the other side just so we
can see which applies better so I have
combination oily skin with acne loving
the rose gold packaging I am super
excited to try this out because this has
been a major Lehigh duck and it has a
glass bottle classy AF and it adds a
pump so I'm gonna use my foundation
palette it kao back and Body Works
candle pump a little bit on here and
we're going to apply to the face my skin
is pretty good right now this is mostly
scarring there's a couple like active
ones but this is mostly all scarring so
we're gonna see how well this covers up
I'm going to start out with the sponge
on the right side of my face and let's
just dip this in they say it has
lightweight buildable coverage looks
like a light coverage with the sponge
I'm going to do a second layer but first
we're going to go in on the other side
with this brush I have a feeling that a
brush will apply this better just boy it
feels on my face I think the sponge
soaked up a lot of that so I'm going in
with a couple more pumps I'm actually
going to switch brushes and we'll see if
we can get a little bit more coverage
with my Sigma f80 to this brush
typically gives you a little bit more
coverage so far even with the brush is
looking like pretty light coverage then
we'll get some more coverage of this
because this is like way too light for
my liking shade wise it looks nice okay
I'm going to go in for a second layer on
this side you
see everything and like even on my skin
tone you can still see redness freckles
acne pretty much everything it is a
super thin formula trying to think what
foundation this reminds we have has a
nice dewy satin finish and we definitely
got a little bit more coverage this
still looks super natural I personally
like my face to look kind of flawless I
like a more full coverage foundation but
for people I just want to even out their
skin tone and want their kind of some of
their imperfections to still be peeking
through and just look a little bit more
even I can see this working for when you
build it up after it's starting to set
it actually gives you a lot more
coverage I've used a ton of foundation
so far a little bit of this definitely
does not go a long way I just tried to
put some more over my nose and it looks
pretty bad it looks like it just totally
brushed away yeah my nose looks totally
scaly textured right now much better I
feel like I'm having to use way too much
product right now okay so I feel like
finish wise it looks best to get the
coverage that you can out of the brush
and then go in with the makeup sponge to
make the finish look super flawless and
like blended to get the kind of coverage
that I personally like I just had to
apply pretty much three layers of
foundation which I wouldn't do on an
everyday basis but the fact that we have
pretty much three layers on my face
right now it looks really nice Verity
skin like it's kind of like melting into
my skin and what would actually set well
okay this site is like fully set when it
actually sets it looks like it gets to a
lot more of a satin finish versus like a
full-on dewy finish so it's pretty satin
matte down here I wanted to try out the
Born This Way by Too Faced concealer
today I haven't used this yet this is a
shade very fair so figured I would show
you guys on camera this has gotten a ton
of freaking height this is supposed to
be comparable to the Naked skin by urban
decay concealer which is like one of my
favorite concealers of all time okay it
smells like coconut I don't think I've
ever had a scented concealer the
applicator feels super cheap to me feels
very moist
raising for sure feels a lot less creamy
to me than the Urban Decay Naked my
under eyes look super moisturized right
now I don't you guys can see that but
they're like dewy not as much coverage
as Urban Decay Naked not sure if I
understand the comparison there I don't
think I'm gonna use concealer on the
center of my face like I usually do
today just because I've never used this
concealer before I don't want to alter
the foundation going in with my
stargazer powder like always to set the
under-eye I'm just going to take a tiny
bit of that powder and put it on my
t-zone not a whole lot I don't think I'm
going to set the rest of my face yeah
the foundation feels totally set which I
like I like not having to put a powder
overtop you could definitely go straight
in with your bronzer which is what I'm
about to do so it is now 11:40 getting a
late start I was working this morning
and then worked out so we are here let's
do the rest of my makeup and I will be
right back all right so it's now twelve
fourteen and the foundation everything
blended out really nicely on top it
basically feels like you're putting
product on top of powder which is really
nice amazing the color now that
everything's on my face ends kind of set
in the color looks a tad bit too dark
but nothing horrible let's take a
close-up look no creasing anywhere yet
it looks pretty good just looks kind of
like skin it definitely has more of a
matte finish we are going to keep
checking back throughout the night if I
keep this on pretty late since we did
start this super late so it's now 444 so
the foundations been on for about five
hours and it looks good my nose area
looks really good which is something
that I always look for I typically get
major creasing around my nose area with
certain foundations I have a tiny bit of
mouth lines right here downside it
definitely oxidized I've hard to tell
with this light but in real life there's
definitely a difference between my face
in my neck now as far as overall wear it
looks really good right now it looks
like all my blush bronzer highlight is
still fully on my forehead looks a
little bit more shiny but not oily it
just looks kind of dewy at this point
about to go pick up rage and we're going
to go to Sephora because I've literally
called
six different Sephora's to try and find
Josie Maran Argan bye
see lexical vibrancy argan oil
foundation lightest shade rg5 is sold
out online is sold out in every single
store and I found a one store 45 minutes
away that has one of my shades in stock
so I'm going to go pick that up
dedication this is what I do for you
guys
update on the concealer and definitely
see some creasing under there not loving
the way that looks right now my next
check in will probably be pretty late so
I will be back with lash chicken
so it is now 11 where's the time it's
11:30 at night I am ready to take this
off so Rach and I went to dinner and
Ross and the lighting and Ross whoo
lighting in Ross tells all so first of
all for being on for 12 hours I think it
looks pretty good the shade is
definitely too dark for me I think it
oxidized quite a bit throughout the day
but also I think it was just a tad dark
to start with I definitely feel like I
have new breakouts forming so I don't
know if it's from this foundation but
notice that I'm a lot more oily but
again this is after 12 hours of where
you compared to what a lot of
foundations look like after 12 hours on
me this looks pretty good overall
thoughts I'm not super in love with this
foundation if I have a super high
thicker consistency a foundation that I
want to kind of shear out I might mix it
in but for $45 doesn't really seem worth
it to me if you like light coverage
foundations that are pretty long-lasting
I think it might be worth giving it a
shot I do like that it mattifies I like
that it sets and I like that it was
pretty long-lasting considering I don't
think it's horrible but it's definitely
not like my favorite thing I've ever
tried so that wraps up day one of 15
days of foundation make sure you
subscribe to don't miss out on day two
I'm gonna kind of be switching between
high-end and drugstores just to switch
it up and get a good variety in there
love you guys thanks for watching see in
my next video bye see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
