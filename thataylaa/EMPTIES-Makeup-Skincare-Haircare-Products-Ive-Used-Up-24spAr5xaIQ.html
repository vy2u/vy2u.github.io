for the last two months and now I'm
gonna show it to you you get a
surprising feeling of achievement
staring at all of these trash kinda
don't want to throw it away so this is
the first empties video that I have ever
done on my channel and I think it's kind
of a cool concept because I don't know
about you but I'm one of those people at
the drugstore who's like checking out
the person next to me is cart to see
what they got and some of stuff I would
have never thought to pick up so I think
this is kind of a cool way to see what
I've used and the stuff that I might not
have mentioned in previous videos and
then you can kind of hear my thoughts
about it and all of that good stuff
so I don't even know where to start so
first I have a couple makeup products I
used up the L'Oreal magic Lumi primer
this is not silicone based and has a
little bit of a strong smell but I like
the way that it makes my foundation
apply on top of it gives you a really
nice Lumi finish I love this stuff I'll
probably repurchase it I wish they made
it where it doesn't smell like ass but
what are you gonna do the red cherry
number 43 it lashes people always rave
about these and for my eye shape they
were way too long I actually ordered a
bunch of these on eBay and I ended up
giving them away to my coworker next we
have Neutrogena makeup remover cleansing
towelettes I have like four of these I
think I just spaced out and threw away
the other ones that I've used up but
these have been my favorite makeup
remover wipes for as long as I can
remember I probably am using these for
like I don't even know three years now
I use these for all over my face as well
as for anything my eye makeup I don't
use like an oil-based eye makeup remover
these take off literally everything I
just go in with this all over my face
and eyes and then I use my face wash
then I have Herbal Essence long-term
relationship shampoo this has been
sitting in my shower since I moved in in
like August
I have shampoo ad D OCD I have like 10
different bottles of shampoo in my
shower
and when I finally use one up it's like
a freaking miracle I don't think this is
like extraordinarily amazing it smells
really good and I'm always a fan of her
blessings then for body wash we have
suave men refreshing body wash this
smells like man could you guess by the
name of it smells so good it leaves your
skin smelling like that who doesn't want
to smell like a man well we're on the
man scent themed mahogany teak wood
candle by Bath &amp;amp; Body Works I have like
four of these stocked up ready to go
smell so good I have a whole bath &amp;amp;
Bodyworks candle hall you can hear me
dissect all of the Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
scents into what kind of man they smell
like I'll link it right here I have two
Physicians Formula powders which are
completely gone if you've seen any of my
videos you've heard me talking about
these but these are the mineral where
tell free foundation and the another one
they are pretty powdery so I tend to go
through them superfast
I love these give you great coverage
used it every single day wearing it
right now actually have a lot of in
here I did not realize I kept like
almost filming this and then I'd be
almost out of another thing so I just
wait and then it was like this
never-ending cycle then I have two
Neutrogena face products the first is
the acne stress control toner I've been
using this stuff for a couple years now
I love it I use it after I get a shower
just to remove any extra stuff on my
face Mel this is like really interesting
and really appealing to me then the
Neutrogena rapid clear foaming scrub
this has the exfoliating beads in it I
don't think I've ever met a Neutrogena
face wash that I didn't like I would
definitely repurchase this I just really
like their whole rapid clear line in
general then we have another Neutrogena
facial face wash this is the fresh
foaming cleanser it says it's a makeup
remover and cleanser in one and you can
put this on your eyes it doesn't burn I
have super sensitive eyes and this is
totally fine on it it literally removes
all of your makeup I will use this in
the shower if I have any left over like
mascara or anything on my eyes and this
takes everything away next I have two
things from Proactiv the first is the
pore targeting treatment and this is a
benzoyl peroxide treatment has 2.5%
benzoyl peroxide and you put this on
before the moisturizer
and these are like mini sizes I don't
know why they send you this the first
time you order you pay the same amount
but they give you tiny ass bottles but
this is the complexion perfecting
hydrator I really like this moisturizer
I do think that this really helped clear
up my skin if you've seen videos from
like four months ago I had like pretty
intense cystic acne and this really
helped to clear up my skin now I'm using
more of the polished choice line and I
really like that for like maintaining my
develop clean skin acne for your skin I
do think that this definitely helps a
few suffer from acne I would definitely
recommend trying Proactiv but fair
warning there customer service
sucks then I have two of the L'Oreal
waterproof luminous carbon black
mascaras these are like so worn that you
can't even see the name I mentioned
these in my drugstore makeup starter kit
which I will link over here but these
are my all-time favorite Holy Grail
mascaras
these are super wet formula so if you
like that then buy another one of my
everyday mascara is wet and wild make
links I use these on my bottom lashes
every single day it has really small
bristles so it's good for getting in
there then I have Urban Decay chill
makeup setting spray this feels exactly
the same as the frickin all nighter
setting spray which I'm using right now
I don't know why this is chilling it's
not chilling at all but it does a really
good job of keeping your makeup looking
good all day I really go through the
body wash apparently I have two more
body washes the first is simply Olay
coconut milk this smells amazing I don't
know how much you can say about a body
wash this is April brand from Dollar
Tree because apparently I was getting a
little cheap this is the tropical scent
it smells really good I find that this
one 8 I don't know I go through this
super fast this one lasts me like
probably a month and this one lasts me
like a couple weeks literally in this
bottle is freaking huge then I have a
conditioner Pantene pro-v
nature fusion future friendly I wash my
hair probably every like 3 to 4 days
because I have super thick hair that
doesn't get oily so whenever I actually
finish a shampoo or conditioner it's
like
exciting thing that happened to full
year then I have a deodorant this is
what I use if you want to know it's from
Dollar Tree it's lady speed stick powder
fresh it works good then we have a
toothpaste I'm just chillin holding all
these because there's nowhere else to
put them
you guys are you put them back in bag my
favorite toothpaste which is crest 3d
white this one is in glamorous white I
swear by this stuff this stuff just
helps take away the surface stains I'm a
coffee drinker and a red wine drinker so
without this stuff my teeth are not
looking good I have a new via kiss of
smoothness chapstick not that
interesting I think I got this in Israel
my last two things are both makeup
products my all-time favorite maybelline
superstay this was also in my it doesn't
look like it's empty of us where it is
in my drugstore makeup starter kit video
love this stuff if you want to know more
about this you can watch that video my
covergirl and Olay simply ageless eye
concealer this is the concealer in a pot
that was discontinued but don't worry I
found a new go-to concealer which is the
NYX HD photogenic for a while I didn't
know what I was gonna do I felt like the
world was ending you can still find this
stuff on eBay if you're interested in
trying it out but yeah they don't make
it in the drugstore anymore so thanks
