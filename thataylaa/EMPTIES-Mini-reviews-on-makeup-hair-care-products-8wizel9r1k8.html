like my vibe is a little off because I'm
in a different background obviously
wearing some pinup makeup if you want to
see a tutorial in this I will link it
over here I can't tell you how excited I
am to finally be filming this video
because I've literally had this bag of
trash sitting in my room for like a
month and a half now I really like I'm
do is videotape and some products that I
might not mention in like a tutorial or
shout out interviews or something so
these are all just kind of random stuff
that I use a lot I do have I think two
other empties videos so if you want to
see those I will link them in the down
bar we have a lot of to get
through so the first thing is this axe
excite body wash yes this is for men
technically but who cares this smells so
good it's like a good combo of man so
smells kind of girly I feel like I'm
pretty picky with my body wash and I
really liked this one
I definitely repurchase this and I think
it smells heavenly next is this joy Co
color under conditioner I wasn't a huge
fan of this I don't think it really made
my hair feel soft afterwards at all if
anything I would use this once a week
and then use my other conditioners just
to use this up
it smells like the hair salon smell is
about the only thing I like about it I
feel like whenever I try like
professional brand shampoos and
conditioners they don't amaze me as much
as drugstore ones do while we're on the
shower theme let's just keep going this
is the Pantene expert keratin repair
conditioner this stuff is usually pretty
pricey for the drugstore I think every
tails for about nine dollars I actually
found this on clearance at Walgreens for
like two bucks I decided to try it out I
really really like this stuff I like
this better than the normal Pantene
conditioner made my hair feels super
stocked it smells amazing smells like
argan oil but a little more suwanee no
complaints with this I also like the
black sleek packaging I would probably
for sure repurchase this probably for
sure next I used up an entire bottle of
my Urban Decay just like makeup setting
spray this is pretty nasty I don't know
if you
see this bottle but there's like makeup
and unknown substances all over it this
is just an awesome makeup setting spray
I literally can't go a day without
setting my makeup feels wrong I decided
to switch it up and when this one ran
out I purchased the Scandinavia makeup
finishing spray these are both made by
Scandinavia this just has an urban decay
name on it I really like the black
bottle because it won't get the Groves
like makeup things all over it this is
also an oil control formula so if I
really like this I don't know if I
noticed a huge difference between the
two pretty shook this same product just
in different bottles and I have the
Maybelline Dream wonder fluid touch
Foundation I've mentioned this multiple
times and videos I have a whole first
impressions video on this I mentioned it
in a favorites video I love this stuff a
repurchased it this is in the shade 10
porcelain ivory make sure if you have
fair skin you get 10 not 15 because no
set on the lot of the display is a
lighter shape that they have is 15 so I
just picked that up thinking that was
the lightest one and I got home and I
realized that it's not so make sure you
get 10 if you have fair skin I haven't
been using it lately because I have some
more acne going on they need to cover up
when I have a better skin day I
definitely reach for this stuff then I
have a baby bottle of the Maybelline no
benefit Porefessional I did repurchases
I got the big guy I really really like
this I don't know if I noticed a huge
difference with it minimizing my pores
but if you're looking for a primer that
makes your makeup last longer I
definitely definitely think this helps I
totally think it's worth the money if
you're on the fence about it get the
tiny size like I did I think it's like
10 bucks try it out I have to do a rinse
this is how long my empties have been
sitting there I've gone through two
things of deodorant versus the shower
fresh then in this one is powder fresh I
like them both I always get this brand
and works really well for me this is
from Dollar Tree I always try and like
switch up my deodorants and get the
binnacle straightened stuff and it never
does as it is the job as these do I
don't know I have another face primer
this is the Maybelline instant age
rewind primer this is a good option if
you want a drugstore primer and
something that's a little more
affordable I've used this for a couple
years now then I have NYX HD photogenic
in lavender if you watch any of my
shadow news videos I love me some nyx
concealer lavender concealer is really
great if you have fair skin and you need
to lighten your concealer this is how i
lighten it i just mix in a little bit of
this with whatever product I'm using
it's like 5 bucks from Ulta another
shampoo I feel like I really went for
the shampoos this is the upside down
Herbal Essence touchably smooth
straightening shampoo I don't know why I
got the straightening one I think they
just liked the scent of it you can't go
wrong with Herbal Essence I'm not really
crazy about the smell the more I use it
the more I like didn't wanna use it did
the job I just realized that I have
another one of the NYX HD concealers I
wish I could like open this up somehow
because I feel like there's still some
product like down at the weight bottom
that you can't get out so people say
that they've gone through these really
fast I also feel like that this one in
particular I feel like lasted me
literally a couple weeks
the lavender ones lasts me a little bit
longer I don't know what's going on then
I have two of the Neutrogena makeup
remover white packet things I've used
these for years I love them they take
off all of my makeup I use them on my
face and my eyes literally gets off
everything I've never been one to use
like the separate pads on my eyeballs I
just like one product that's gonna do it
all the Neutrogena oil-free acne stress
control power players grow up it's quite
the name
I love Neutrogena face wash this has
some salicylic acid in it so it's good
for acne I need to go back to Neutrogena
face wash because I feel like my skin
has gotten worse since I stopped using
this this one smells good it smells kind
of like cucumber I would repurchase this
and I need to repurchase this Kim's
going crazy right now
then I have a bunch of mascaras first I
have the Mac prep and prime eyelash
primer you guys know I use this every
single day I can't live without this
stuff when I don't use this stuff I feel
like the mascara doesn't go on as easy I
don't know how to describe it but I
can't not use this stuff now I've
already purchased it and I use it
everyday and I have the L'Oreal miss
manga mascara I've used this in a few
shadow n schmooze videos I really liked
the formula of this I was not a fan of
the brush at all the brush bends which i
think is so dumb like
I don't want to have to move my eyes and
the brush and everything why can't we
just have a brush that stays still and
it's supposed to be easier for you to
get in your lashes but it just makes
everything more difficult in my opinion
I do like the formula though so what I
would do to finish this off is I use the
Maybelline falsies brush with this
formula I love Maybelline falsies this
is one of my favorite mascaras I still
use this every single day I do like the
non waterproof version better than the
waterproof version I just think it goes
on easier it's also weight easier to
take off this is like completely worn
off this is the wet and wild make a
length mascara this is my favorite
mascara for bottom lashes it doesn't
leave the little dots on the bottom if
you have long lashes it dries fast the
brush is great for bottom lashes because
it's so tiny and stiff type of is baby
wipes I use baby wipes to take off the
foundation from the back of my hand and
just clean up my makeup area and
whatever I need they're a lot cheaper
than the Neutrogena makeup wipe so
whenever I can I used baby wipes instead
a Crest toothpaste this is the luxe 3d
white I love the crest whitening
toothpaste line I stopped using this for
a few months and I literally saw a
difference in my teeth might have been
psychological but I think it actually
makes difference I also really like
their mouthwash but it messed up my lip
piercing so I can't use it anymore
then I have the Sally Hansen mega shine
topcoat this is my favorite top coat
I've already repurchased this if you're
someone who always ends up denting their
nails after you paint them this is
awesome it's super shiny and it dries
really fast I don't have an issue with
denting my nail polish anymore I'm
wearing it right now enough that you can
tell I also really like the bottle last
thing is Carmex lip balm I found this at
Dollar Tree and I decided no try it out
I love this stuff I've been using the
lip sille lip balm every night since I
ran out of this and I do really like
this but I don't think it does as great
of a job and moisturizing as Carmex does
doesn't really love like the menthol
minty scent it kind of like doesn't
tingle on your lips but you can
definitely feel the menthol I will for
sure be repurchasing this once I use up
my lips ole
check out Dollar Tree if you want to try
this out
is I think they pretty much always
happens that was all of my empties I'm
so excited to put this stuff in trash if
you like empties videos and you want to
see more of them give a thumbs up so I
know to keep collecting my trash be sure
to check the down bar for the other
envies videos and if you want to see the
pinup makeup tutorial on this look it's
all down there love you guys thanks for
watching and see you in my next video
