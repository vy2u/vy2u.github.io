days of foundation this is where I test
out a new foundation every single day
for 15 days if you're new here all the
information for 15 days of foundation is
down below sorry for those of you have
to hear this feel 5,000 times today is a
weird day I got three hours of sleep
last night and then I worked out this
morning which never happens so during
the last season and 15 days of
foundation I tried out the Kat Von D
lock-it tattoo Foundation and a couple
older foundations that I had worn before
I just hadn't ever done a full video on
so I'm doing that again in this series
this foundation is one that is obviously
quite old it's kind of a cult favorite
foundation for high coverage and for
oily skin
I've combination skin when acne so in
theory this should be right up my alley
Drive and say what this is I don't think
I did this is the Estee Lauder Double
Wear foundation I have one that's quite
a bit I actually went back to look at
old videos to see what I thought of this
and in one of my razón rejects videos a
couple years ago I mentioned this
foundation mixed in with the Revlon
Colorstay and that's been kind of my
experience with this this has been a
foundation that on my skin looks pretty
heavy and pretty cakey when it's not
mixed in with something so in the past I
have like this mixed in with products
just not in love with it by itself but
today we're going to be trying it out on
its own so you guys can see what I think
of it when I went back and watched the
two videos that I mentioned this in
apparently this was my first ever
high-end foundation purchase which is
just wild that videos from 2014 and now
we are here over the years I'd probably
run this foundation alone about five to
ten times and I've worn it mixed for
probably I don't even know over a month
but I don't think I've worn this very
recently probably the last time was
about six to eight months ago so this is
kind of like a first impression again
for me too so let's hop on to store and
read some of the claims as such a janky
set up right now my mirror
on top of my laptop which is on top of
makeup so it's retails for 3950 why
couldn't they just make this 40 bucks
and you get one fluid ounce of product
in here which is standard if I'm
counting correctly on Sephora this comes
in 36 shades on Estee Lauder's UK
website it comes in a wider range it
comes in 44 shades the lightest shade on
Sephora is one c1 cool bone which is
this shade right here back in the day I
actually had to order this thing on eBay
for a absurd amount literally think I
paid about 80 bucks for this this is in
the shade one c0 shell this is the
lightest shade that they make in this
foundation even though one c0 is listed
on the UK Estee Lauder website you can't
actually order it from there if you're
in the u.s. if you're in the US and you
want to participate 1c0 I found it on a
site called feel unique free shipping in
the US and it retails for 39 68 on there
so pretty much the exact same prices for
us so I'll leave a link to the product
don't feel unique down below along with
Sephora that's awesome that they have it
because I don't even know why I spent
this much money on this I have a ton of
shades
I'm insert swatches right here of one C
0 and one C one compared to some of the
other foundations that I own
alright so swatch time right here's
Estee Lauder Double Wear and a shade one
C zero next over is double wear and one
C one as you can see there's a huge
difference between these two shades
this is derma called 2:08 next overs
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless in
110 Urban Decay Naked skin foundation in
0.5 and pur cosmetics parallel
foundation in porcelain wouldn't say 1 2
0 is a super pale foundation for me and
matches me now my skin has been changing
I've definitely gotten more color in the
last year I don't know I don't know
what's going on because I haven't been
out in the Sun the fish shade used to be
too dark for me still and right now it's
looking like it matches pretty well
packaging is just a glass bottle with
this gold top I got the pump on
PDMP while ago years ago so let's say
some of the claims it says is a 24 hour
flawless foundation that stays looking
fresh and natural throughout heat
humidity and non-stop activity
I don't know how active my day is going
to be today on Estee Lauder's website it
says 15 hours staying power as far as
website it says 24 hours staying power
natural looking and carefree coverage a
lightweight oil-free and buildable
formula that's all the claims it does
have SPF 10 which isn't super
significant so you probably still want
to use a moisturizer with
yes underneath if you guys are excited
for 50 News Foundation they should give
this video a thumbs up
I am pre recording these I'm recording
this right now I haven't even posted the
announcement video yet if there's any
live time updates like when this video
is going up I will put it down below in
the comments and just pin the comment
you can also follow along on all of my
social media there over here so if you
want to see what I think of the estee
lauder double wear foundation and how it
applies somewhere throughout the day and
i replace just keep watching
extremely sleep-deprived right now but
I've had like four cups of coffee so I
think we're good to go
I've already washed moisturize and
primed my face for newsom morphe 31
brush on one half of my face in my Real
Techniques sponge on the other since I
have used this before I know for a fact
that one c1 is too dark for me one c0
shell is definitely closer in the video
where I mentioned mixing this with the
Revlon Colorstay I use the Real
Techniques sponge to apply it and I said
that I liked it best with a sponge but
we're going to try out both one thing
I've always felt with this is that for
some reason on my skin it doesn't look
quite as completely opaque as on other
people I would still call this full
coverage but you can still see my dark
kind of acne scars coming through and
when I used to wear this I kind of had
to put on again just watch
I had to either spot conceal or put on a
tiny bit more for a second layer just on
those spots with a brush on this half of
my face it looks fine eyebrow down but
on my forehead it's not looking super
great looks pretty heavy on the center
of my face and it's also picking up on
some dry patches up here so let's go in
with a sponge on this side literally
holding my watch as I do this right now
yeah I definitely prefer how this
applies with a sponge better I feel like
a sponge helps that make it look a
little bit less heavy and on my forehead
it definitely looks better on the sponge
side on any spots that are still coming
through like down here some acne and
over here I'm just going to go back in
with a sponge and do a thin second layer
this foundation in the past has kicked
up pretty easily on me and looked pretty
heavy so I'm going to use as little
product as possible it does build it is
covering but again just be careful that
you don't use too much product on the
part that looks dry on my forehead
before going over it with a sponge
definitely helped to bring some life
back into my skin the center of my
forehead looks a lot better now
bending over my table right now but
here's what
Foundation looks like up close
definitely looks better once I went over
it with the sponge less textured so nice
to mix this with the Revlon Colorstay I
didn't powder my face and apparently it
stayed on all day this one is supposed
to be a stay in place long wear makeup
so I'm not going to powder my face and
in the past and I have tried to powder
my face with this it looks way too heavy
and it kind of makes my foundation
settle into any crease lines that I have
right now it is 11:15 I'm going to do
the rest of my makeup and I will be
right back okay so it's now 11:50 that
one took me a while I'm going to call
the check-in time 11:20 since that's
about when I finished up my face makeup
I did not set my face with a powder
everything blended out really easily on
top it didn't feel like it had any kind
of drag or stick to it
my concealer though went on a little
weird I use my normal Tarte shape tape I
got a little bit of weird texture under
there it might just be because my under
eyes are dry right now it's looking much
more luminous under these lights than it
is when I'm out of the lights and I went
in the bathroom mirror and looked in
this mirror it looked totally matte it
just looks like I'm wearing foundation
it looks a little bit heavy right now
it's not really kicking up or creasing
anywhere yet it just looks heavy it
looks like I have makeup on but we'll
see how it wears throughout today maybe
I'll sink differently of it now so on
the rest of my face I had to wear this
again because I use the cover FX bronzer
in Sunkist again with the Sigma F 15
brush and I love it with this this is
beautiful if you have fair skin
I like this 50 times better than the
hoola light bronzer which I have a whole
video on suits of Physicians Formula
butter blush in plum rose and then I
used hourglass ethereal light ambient
lighting powder as a highlight I just
wanted something that was going to make
my skin look a bit more natural and skin
light so I use to make up forever liquid
lipstick in 1:03 and then on top of that
I put my favorite wet and wild nudie
patootie and then all of my eyeshadows
right now are the Coastal Scents
revealed 2 palette this is also from
back in the day this used to be one of
my favourite eyeshadow palettes so all
of my eyeshadows are this palette I
still like it I'm not quite as obsessed
with it as it used to be and my
eyelashes are black magic lashes in
alpha girl let's set the alarms for
check-ins
I'm going to go attempt to get my life
together right now next year can I do
will be a natural lighting and I will
see you guys in a few hours my eyelashes
are all up in me right now
alright so it's now for 30 years of
foundations long
five hours I took an impromptu trip to
home goods with Christi we just did some
major damage how we did the Foundation's
on for five hours I feel like I just
feel like it is something my foundation
I guess one of those foundations it's
just a foundation that you can see on
race yeah it is starting to crease a
little bit around my nose and around my
mouth nothing major on my upper lip yet
I don't have my blog camera but we're in
the cars I'm on my song can see like all
my peach fuzz right here I'm not getting
any oil or anything coming through yet
so that's good I didn't powder my face
so I'm going to keep wearing this and I
will check in with you guys at the end
of the night I don't keep doing this
I'll try better nice like 45 minute guys
okay so it is No 9:30 p.m. so the
Foundation's been on for 10 hours and
today actually turned into a really good
day these are happy tears I just posted
the announcement video today in my time
and I've been reading through your
comments for the last two hours and I'm
just so I have no words
it feels so grateful that I have this
community and okay we're here we got it
just know that it means so much to me
and I appreciate everything and all of
your support and the t-shirts have been
up for literally two hours now a little
over two hours and we've already raised
over a thousand dollars so thank you
guys so much I don't even know where
we'll be out by the time this video goes
up put it in the comments and I'll pin
it and I'll be updating guys on social
media to with how much we've raised few
of you guys were asking if I can make
heck yeah
t-shirt versions so I started looking
into that and do that so hopefully I
mean you guys worry about what types of
video goes up but those should be up
when you're seeing this video I think
I'm gonna try doing on black t-shirts so
anyways on to the foundation the oil has
held up very well I must say like after
ten hours I'm barely oily on my forehead
is separating a tiny tiny bit on the
center I'm not getting as much creasing
as I normally do when I only wear this
product I don't feel like my blush and
bronzer have held up very well I feel
like they've kind of totally rubbed off
like I can't even see my blush right now
around my nose area and stuff it doesn't
look as bad as it has
and I only use this the thing that I'm
not totally in love with about this is
that it just looks like makeup what
you're thinking said ten times by now if
you like this one you should not so and
let me know what kind of if you use a
powder if you use a different primer or
what it just looks and feels a bit heavy
to me wearing it today I definitely
don't hate this one zone at all you
still prefer mixing this in with other
foundations but this has kind of
inspired me to bring this out again and
see which foundations I like mixing it
with and if there's a good combo because
it has held up really well so whenever I
find products like this that hold up
well and that help control my oil those
are always products that I like to mix
in with other foundations so here's what
it looks like zoomed in I mean after 10
hours yeah I think this looks pretty
good you could still see some stuff
coming through and Target like it
doesn't look totally totally
full-coverage to me rubbed off in
certain places like where I've been
rubbing my nose which is kind of
expected but without a powder and then I
think it looks pretty good right now so
for the wrap up video I'll definitely
try mixing this in foundations and I'll
let you guys know if I find a combo that
I really like but I hope you guys liked
this video it's not too helpful if you
did make sure you give this a thumbs up
I love you guys thanks for watching see
you tomorrow right
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
