all right so today it is day 15 of 15
days of foundation this is where I've
been testing out a new foundation every
single day for 15 days today is the last
day but if you are new here you're just
stumbling across this video all days 1
through 14 are linked down below in a
playlist you can go catch up watch them
all if you found my channel through this
series this time around let me know down
below I like getting to see you guys I
recognize your pictures on YouTube and
on social so say hi down below welcome
to the big Reno family it's a good time
I'm not gonna make this intro super long
but it is last day so if you like I need
to tell you guys some stuff so I told
you guys last time around that I'm doing
this series on my channel every 4 months
which is still true please don't start
hammering so this is not the end of 15
days of foundation it's coming around
again those of you who don't know I do
foundation Friday on my channel as well
every single Friday there's a new
foundation video so the foundation
videos are not disappearing
I love Foundation too much for that to
happen thank you guys so much for all
your support throughout this series
especially to those of you who have
purchased 15 days of foundation t-shirts
I'm texting with the lady from Project
Beauty share and they're just thrilled
I'm really happy with the turnout from
the t-shirts as well so thank you guys
so much I love seeing all of your photos
wearing them I haven't decided when I'm
taking down the t-shirts yet but I think
they're only going to be up for a couple
weeks after this series so if you
haven't gotten one and you want to
support Project Beauty share half the
proceeds go to them the link is in the
description box of every 15 days of
foundation video I'm giving myself about
a week and a half to try out the
foundations again for the wrap up video
wrap up videos basically where I rank
all of the foundations 1 to 15 tell you
how wearing them different ways worked
out what I think of them kind of my
final thoughts that will be coming up
after Thanksgiving I typically upload
Monday Wednesday Fridays the next couple
weeks are going to be weird upload wise
I'm still going to be having other
videos coming out I'm gonna be in
California for Thanksgiving and I feel
like I need to also kind of take a break
after this whole thing make sure you're
following me on social that is where I
update you guys with anything related to
my channel snapchat Twitter Facebook
Instagram I'm on them all ok now that we
have a 20 minute long intro so today
we're going to be trying out the Estee
Lauder Double Wear maximum
I'm a cover foundation this was one that
a few guys told me to check out I hadn't
actually heard of this before I did not
know this existed
the estee lauder double wear I should
get that I do have the original estee
lauder double wear foundation this is
the maximum cover version this one is
supposed to cover tattoos scarring
pretty much anything this is like this
one on crack I'm not a huge fan of this
one I don't actually have a dedicated
review to this so let me know if you'd
want to see that for a foundation Friday
or something but this one's just a
little bit too heavy for me I do like
this for mixing in with other
foundations if I want to give a ton of
coverage I've never been super impressed
by this one so we're going to see this
one is any different the bone on just
forward to read some of the claims this
retails for 3950 you get one fluid ounce
of product in here which is very
standard you also get one fluid ounce in
the original double where it only comes
in eight shades the lightest shade is
one and three creamy vanilla which is
what I have you guys will see in the
demo but I'm looking pretty freakin
bronzed today throwback to my 16 year
old self so it says it's a soothing
natural-looking liquid cream makeup
designed to camouflage the appearance of
skin imperfections they actually have a
typo on here
does anyone else find like extreme
satisfaction from finding typos provides
maximum coverage including surgical
scars tattoos birthmarks sunspots and
veins it does have an SPF 15 I'm going
to search some swatches of this shade
compared to Estee Lauder Double Wear and
also some of the other foundations I own
just so you can get kind of a comparison
okay swatch times right here is the
Estee Lauder Double Wear maximum cover
and 1 &amp;amp; 3 this is STR double wear and 1
C 0 &amp;amp; 1 C 1 so obviously this is quite
dark the 1 C 0 is a pretty good shade
match for me so you can see how much
darker this one is this is Kat Von D
lock-it l4d2 derma called 2:08 which I
did a review on will have reviews on all
these etude house BB concealer
foundation in the lightest shade which
is a pretty good match for me just so
you know once you one is the lightest
shade you can get in this foundation in
the u.s. I do have one c0 which I paid
out the butt for on eBay but in the u.s.
the lightest it goes as one c1 so I
think that's all
one here a combination skin I usually
get pretty oily throughout the day on my
t-zone if you want to see how the Estee
Lauder Double Wear maximum cover applies
and wears throughout the day you're in
the right place just keep watching I've
already washed moisturize primed my face
juhi anti blemish matte primer we are
really going to see how well this covers
because not only do I have scarring and
stuff right now but I have a bunch of
heat rashes to cover up welcome not
feeling too hot this morning hence why
it's 11 o'clock right now when I'm
starting to film this so like usual I'm
gonna use my Sigma f80 on one side of my
face and then my Real Techniques sponge
on the other see how it applies with
both I like the matte dark blue I'm
weirdly into dark blue right now so
squeeze to bottle this is supposed to be
extreme maximum coverage so I'm gonna
just put out a tiny bit on the back of
the palette to start no idea how much of
this I'm going to need this looks a
little dark whew feel out of it right
now okay so I'm gonna just start by
dabbing this on oh yeah this looks dark
I think I'm just going to start with
that super small amount and see how far
this goes
let's do actual stars and brush I'm
gonna set my face oh this is hella dark
okay I think I need a little more this
is probably like an NC 30 we are gonna
be looking very bronzed today folks it
definitely feels much more lightweight
than the normal Double Wear foundation
and I am getting really good coverage
I'm gonna blend this like all the way
down my neck I think it's hard for you
guys to see the shade sometimes because
of the lights but also like the frame
when I'm just like this you can only see
here up I'm having a totally different
filming set up soon and there is going
to be natural light so I'm super excited
for you to actually be able to see huh
okay I have some thoughts but let's do
the sponge side it almost feels like
you're not really blending anything
feels super super lightweightt this is
weird the sponge is like I don't know if
it's just soaking it all up right now
this is a damp sponge by the way like
normal I did not get nearly as good
coverage with a sponge and it looks
pretty patchy too with a sponge I'm
going to try just dipping the sponge
directly onto the pallet and see if I
can like disperse it on here and then go
okay so that's way better that way my
ears are like straight of white right
now compared in my face I can get a tiny
bit more down here it didn't totally
cover all that yeah I actually think I
like it best just dipping directly into
product it is matte full and matte
finish not set in matte I would say this
is definitely a matte matte finish it
feels really really lightweight like I
almost don't feel anything on my face
and that's how it feels when you blend
it out I think it looks definitely more
flawless and less cakey than the normal
double wear on me I don't like the
normal double wear by itself I usually
make something into that to kind of give
it a more skin like look that one looks
really heavy on me but it is kicking up
and looking a little bit heavy around my
lip and on certain drier areas like the
center of my forehead this is like my
high school self foundation ten shades
to dark I did it how I did my makeup in
high school video I like it a little I
wherever it is J decide just looking at
the formula and how it looks right now I
think it looks good it doesn't look
great it doesn't look horrible there are
certain areas where I don't like how it
looks
it's 1108 so let's just call the
check-in time 11 o'clock I don't think I
want to powder this one because anytime
I powder the Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation it looks like cake city and
also so extremely matte and do the rest
of it makeup and I will be right back
alright so it is now 11:40 went ham on
the makeup today because day 15 gotta go
Ella so the foundation I did not apply a
powder on top blush runs or highlight
blended out totally fine it completely
sets to like a matte almost powdery
finish and it's not really transferring
when I touch my face at all it almost
looks like it got a little bit more of a
satin matte finish on my forehead which
I really like it's kind of fun putting
on makeup today because since I'm like
ten shades darker right now if these old
stuff I can't normally use on my face so
the makeup on the rest of my face is the
nikah kay contour kit I use this shade
like no way in hell would that normally
fly it's actually like a nice reddish
bronze I also use this shade in the
crease of my eyes this brand you can get
from either eye Kate House or shot miss
oh one of the two and it's like a couple
dollars I think it was from my Kate
house I'll link it down below
I always list everything I use on my
face and what I'm wearing down below in
the description box /a is a tiny bit of
the Bom Bom Beach like this neutral kind
of shade highlight holy this looks
totally different on when I have fair
skin this is the makeup forever
profusion light zero - this is the gold
shade of the new makeup forever
highlight which is freaking intense I
was not ready for that eyes I tried out
the Urban Decay
full spectrum palette which I'm now it
was pretty underwhelmed by I use the
shade delirious alchemy and a little bit
of warning this topper right here the
matte shades were like pretty patchy and
chalky and I'll have to keep playing
around on this but right now not that
impressed
Physicians Formula I booster and my
lashes were socialized
siren lashes this is curse' Chris's
brand lips color pop Dux liner with
color pop - - let me stick so check-in
time 11 o'clock next check and I do will
be at natural lighting these lashes will
probably be off these lips will probably
be off because I'm trying to eat right
now see you guys in a few hours I can't
even do this bows because this is a joke
alright so it is now four o'clock I've
already peeled off the lashes took off
the lipstick it is super darker right
now so I'm hoping guys can kind of see
in natural lighting I have our overhead
kitchen on light right now as well okay
so let's get really up close right now
and take a look I think my forehead
pretty much everywhere looks pretty good
set my upper lip there's some creasing
around here in my nose a little bit
nothing bad although certain parts look
a little bit heavy and textured if you
like look around my lip and chin five
hours in I'm not looking super oily or
anything it's holding up pretty dang
well since I started this one pretty
late I'm going to keep this on to like 9
o'clock tonight so we can see 10 hours
so I will check back in
happy in the night alright so it is now
9:15 so it's been on for a little over
ten hours let me make sure that you can
actually see this I'm going to turn it
down a little so ignoring the shade
because I look like an oompa loompa
right now just looking at the actual
foundation I am shocked
wasn't totally loving it the first like
five hours just because it was way too
dark and it was super matte it just
didn't look very much like skin to me I
wished the way it looked in the last
four hours it looked when you first
applied it because right now I mean for
being on for ten freaking hours and not
using a powder it looks great I am not
breaking down anywhere it's fully still
on my forehead
I definitely look dewy now it's not
matte by any means but for someone who
gets pretty oily by this point usually I
think it looks really good if you're
someone who gets oily throughout the day
and you like really matte foundations
you'll probably love this because it'll
make you Matt for the majority of the
day but you won't get probably super
oily at the end of the day for me I
would not be able to wear this shade
outside I wish it came in the normal
shade range that Estee Lauder does but
since this is super long-lasting and it
looks really nice as it wears it almost
like wears better throughout the day I
think I might keep this one to mix in
with something else it is so dark though
trying to think of what I could mix this
in with and I really think the only
thing that might work is a white mixer
just because of how dark this product is
downside for me shade I also didn't
totally love the way it looked the first
five hours I really like how it looks
now I don't know I'm kind of conflicted
because when I looked at my face after
that second check-in I was just kind of
expected to not like this one at all so
maybe mixing in like a super light
weight maybe the Make Up For Ever Ultra
HD or something with this might work I'm
gonna try doing something like that and
I will update you guys in the wrap-up
video if you didn't know I'm going to be
ranking I just talked about this I
talked about this this morning yep
