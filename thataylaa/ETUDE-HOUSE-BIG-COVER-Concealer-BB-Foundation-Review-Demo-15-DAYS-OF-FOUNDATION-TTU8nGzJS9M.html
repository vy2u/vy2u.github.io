I think this may be my new favorite mug
alright so today it is day three of 15
days of foundation this is where I'm
testing out a new foundation every
single day for 15 days days 1 &amp;amp; 2 are
linked down below in a playlist if
you've missed that you can go watch it
I'm pre recording these first two videos
to give myself a little bit of jump
start time so there has been a few days
between day two and now I'm feeling a
lot better with the whole situation
thank you guys so much for all of your
support on everywhere
feeling good hopefully we won't have a
migraine today positive vibes and videos
from here on out I'm excited so today
I'm trying out the etude house big cover
concealer BB foundation so this is a
Korean brand you can get this off of yes
style that's usually where I get you to
- house or you can get on Amazon
sometimes I'm gonna like it down below
where you can find it like always but
this retails for around fifteen to
eighteen dollars depending on where you
get it and you get one point zero five
fluid ounces of product since this is a
Korean brand unfortunately this only
comes in three shades this is actually
catered more towards pale skin which is
awesome if you have pale skin but if you
don't unfortunately this one probably
won't work for you unless you use it as
like a mixer to lighten a foundation
that you already own this has been
really requested so I wanted to throw it
in here and try it out but I apologize
that this obviously only caters to three
skin tones about so I have the lightest
shade which is vanilla I'm just going to
read some of the claims there's
literally two sentences of information
online so it just says it's a concealer
BB cream that covers flaws with this
excellent coverage power and easy
absorption just a small amount delivers
full coverage skin so you are supposed
to be able to get full coverage with
this it kind of reminds me of the
Clinique beyond perfecting foundation
both of these have this huge applicator
and are kind of like a foundation and
concealer in one situation I love this
foundation I have a whole review on this
which I'll link down below - that is
literally all it says online about this
product I'm going to insert some
swatches right now so you can see how
this shade compares to some of the other
foundations I own all right swatch time
right here we have the etude house
foundation in the shade vanilla I also
forgot to mention that this
has an SPF of 50 in it this is that
Clinique foundation in the shade 0.5
breeze right here is Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless and 110 the semi
Kashyap foundation and bisque and Urban
Decay Naked and 0.5 if you guys are
excited about 15 days of foundation
don't forget to give this video a thumbs
up I didn't want to mention it I totally
spaced
since I'm pre recording these videos
probably like I'm hoping to have like
eight or nine days pre-recorded by the
time the first day stars I realized you
can't really send me your pictures and I
can't include them the next day so if
you're sending me your pictures I'm
still screenshotting them and retweeting
you and all that kind of stuff but
they're going to be like delayed a few
days linked for the 15 days of
foundation t-shirts are down below so if
you want to rock your 15 days of
foundation t-shirt down below if you
want to see how this foundation applies
and wears throughout the day you're in
the right place just keep watching
alright so it is 8:35 there are two
dudes scaling the side of my building
right now hopefully you can't hear that
okay so I've already primed my face the
jouer anti blemish matte primer I have
this bunch here on one side I'm going to
use and then we're going to use my Sigma
f80 on the other side by the Shea
vanilla which is the lightest shade I'm
just going to give it a little shake it
looks really similar to the Clinique
bottle key with this applicator yes this
has a giant-ass one just like the clinic
applicator does so has this like curved
applicator and it's supposed to move
back and forth I'm not exactly sure what
the purpose of that is but I guess we'll
find out blonde is giant so I'm going to
start out on this side with a brush
since you wouldn't apply the entire face
with this thing I don't really see the
point of this curved thing it's supposed
to be full coverage so I'm just going to
start with that amount and go in and
blend
it feels a lot thicker than the Clinic
Foundation the clinic one kind of like
just blends really easily this one feels
like a thicker product shade looks
really good looks light enough it's
actually matching my neck like perfectly
covering well I would say just got about
medium coverage high medium maybe well
that was too much I'm going to dab some
butt over here because I was way too
much it's weird it feels thick but once
you actually blend it into your skin it
doesn't have like a super heavy look to
it so let's go in with a sponge on this
side so I have dampened my sponge
someone commented that I was using a dry
sponge
no I dampen my sponge every time before
use it I think they're like this angle
side a little bit better than the flat
side to blend looks and feels a lot less
heavy with the sponge side for sure I
think I got about the same amount of
coverage with the sponge and it just
feels a lot nicer it feels a little bit
lighter so I feel like I used a pretty
decent sized amount and I didn't get
totally full coverage I'm gonna show you
up close
it doesn't look totally full coverage to
me but it has good coverage but I still
feel like you can see my skin underneath
if that makes sense like it's covering
everything I want covered but it still
looks like skin with this amount of
coverage this is supposed to be like a
concealer - I'm going to add a tiny bit
just on a few areas that I feel like I
need a little bit more coverage I'm not
going to do fold two layers
totally got that in my hair okay there
we go
that is totally covering up everything
else I wanted covered I like that you
can use this as a concealer - I didn't
have to do a full two layers to get the
kind of coverage I like it looks like a
satin matte finish we're definitely more
on the matte side it feels like it's
totally setting I don't think I'm going
to set this one with the powders it
looks and feels pretty mattifying I
think if I put a powder on it might look
a little bit heavy so I'm going to apply
the rest of my makeup and I'll be right
back so I forgot to look at the time
right when I left you guys but I just
did this super fast so it's not away
right now let's call the check-in time
nine o'clock for not setting this with
the powder everything blended out
beautifully on top it feels like you
have a powder on top
it completely sets I feel like it's
warmed up to my face a little bit on my
forehead it looks less matte it does
look a little bit heavier on my nose I'm
hoping that doesn't cake up throughout
the day but right now I'm really liking
it I think this shade is like one of the
closer exact shade matches I've ever
found looks pretty much identical to my
neck which rocks so right now around my
nose is the only thing that doesn't look
like perfect everything else looks
really nice so what I put on the rest of
my face on my eyes for the first time I
tried out the Anastasia Beverly Hills
Modern Renaissance palette I finally
caved and got this because people have
been raving about this thing you guys
I'm starting to understand the hype
contour I use the Catrice Prime in fine
annachi radiance and it's like 5 bucks
from Ulta or less than that what I use
for blush blush I use the same thing
I've been kind of rationed for this
everyday I use the shade concept from
this palette start palette and then
highlight I used hourglass diffused
light ambient thing lips are Kylie
cosmetics Dolce K so I'm going to get
some work done I'm actually picking up
Kendall today Kendall Rae from the
airport super excited she's gonna be
staying with me for a few days so this
is why I'm pre filming there's gonna be
like 4 days where I can't film my time
this video goes up this will have
already happened 9 o'clock let's see how
this thing hold ok so it's now a 250 so
the foundations been on for almost 6
hours
Kendall's flight got delayed a little
bit so I'm just getting some more work
done here and then I'll probably do a
check in later later in the night so
this is the only decent lighting spot
can't get all in one frame with this
lens but here is what it looks like in
natural lighting so you have an idea so
I think it's wearing really nicely my
forehead looks great it's not oily it
just looks like skin feel my area that's
a little funky I'm gonna get really up
close there we go can you guys see that
it's like pebbled I've never had that
happen I'm not sure what's going on
there but it's really not noticeable
unless you're like super up-close
looking in a mirror or something I feel
like it's also doing it a little bit
around my nose though right there it's
weird it kind of looks like whiteheads
but
it's not other than that it's looking
really nice so see how is looking at the
end of the night alright so it is 11:15
on the next day actually Kendall came
last night I got super excited totally
took off half of my face and makeup so
today I did the exact same thing with my
makeup that I did yesterday as far as
like my face products so I could redo
this and film this final check-in for
you guys and I'm actually glad I did it
because I noticed some weird things with
the foundation yesterday and I was able
to wear it again today and confirm that
it happened again so I'm going to get a
post in a second and show you but the
foundations went on for a long-ass time
today I put it on at 9 a.m. it's now
11:15 so it's been on for 14 hours which
is a super long check-in most of my
check-ins are around 9:00 or 10:00 so
keep in mind that this has been on
longer than usual so if I look extra oil
that's why but the things I'm going to
show you definitely happened at about
the seven or eight hour point what you
guys saw in the last check-in where it
gets this weird like pile is upward
where it's like tiny little dots like
little pile II weird looking dots on
certain parts of my face that then
continue to break down throughout the
day it is very bizarre I've never had
this happen with the foundation
especially in certain spots where in
both days it's happened in the same
spots I'm gonna get really close you can
see okay so I have turned down the light
so hopefully you guys can see this this
is completely broken down around my nose
and also on the center of my face it did
it throughout the day I feel like this
is kind of understandable because it's
super oily and it's been on for so long
but both days on my chin too and
especially around my nose the major area
was around my nose super weird about six
or seven hours in just completely almost
like seperated and repelled off of my
skin here not sure if there's an
ingredient in this foundation that
doesn't go well with oil let me know if
any of you guys have tried this and had
the same experience I'm kind of bummed
about it because it does look good like
until that point and even then it's not
super noticeable until you get really up
close I've been coming into the
apartment today I was talking to Kendall
about it and she said it looked good
from like far away still keep in mind I
have my ring light on so it's like
reflecting the oil
more but throughout the day we are
walking around we are walking a lot I
was sweating and I do feel like it looks
good throughout the day it just has this
weird thing around my nose so I'm
definitely try it with different primers
it might be with the primer I'm using
underneath it and I will try it with a
different primer and update you in the
wrap-up video for this series but kind
of concluding thoughts I love the
coverage of it I love the shade doesn't
blend out super easily feels a little
bit heavier don't like how it breaks
down throughout the day don't think it's
super super long-lasting but considering
the fact that I didn't put any powder on
my face at all I think if you only have
to wear it for about 7 or 8 hours you
should be ok I'm probably going to keep
wearing this and just try it with
different primers and powders because I
feel like the shade for me is spot-on
I like the coverage it's kind of just
quick to apply since I get enough
coverage off of that one layer and then
just some spot concealing if you have
dry skin I don't think this one will be
for you more mature skin again since it
goes on a little bit heavier and has a
thicker formula I think this might
settle in some lines I would say if you
have normal to combo skin if you have
oily skin you might want to set it with
a powder I did not look this oily
throughout the day this has been on for
14 hours so overall I like it enough to
continue to wear it for sure if you
liked this video and you're excited
about 15 days foundation make sure you
give this video a thumbs up
love you guys thanks for watching see
you tomorrow
