all right so today I've got some stuff
to show you guys some clothes some
makeup and every single thing I'm gonna
be showing you guys today is under 15
bucks so I thought it'd be fun to do a
whole buy like price point I don't think
I've ever done that so let's get into it
if you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the baby doe
family and subscribe upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time so
the makeup I got was all from Ulta just
because drugstore makeup in Seattle I've
just totally given up on at this point
we have nothing even the Oulton Seattle
has nothing so I just order everything
online that I need from the drugstore
lately Ulta has a ton of new drugstore
price items on there so picked up a
bunch of stuff and the clothes I'm gonna
show you guys is all from thread up
thread it'd be sponsoring today's videos
thank you to them for collaborating with
me again thread up is like heaven to me
it's basically like an online
consignment shop and the pieces on there
pretty much like new which I feel like
is part of the struggle when you go to
the thrift store is having to sort
through everything half the stuff is
like faded or has rips or stains on it
and thread up basically does that for
you so when you're shopping everything
that I've gotten so far has looked
pretty much like new it's not super
faded it's not like bawling and the
fabrics not super worn out looking you
can shop on their website or they also
have an app and you can put in kind of
your preset so like sizes any price
limits you want so I just have that
saved so every time I go in there it
knows that I'm only looking for shirts
and certain sizes and dresses in certain
sizes so it just makes it super quick so
for this time I just set the price limit
to 15 bucks so it was only showing me
items under $15 all right so here we go
everything comes in this super cute
polka dot box he got the cute tissue
paper I feel like I scored this time for
what I got for under 15 bucks first
thing I got is this kind of chiffon
dress it has super cute beading on here
little diamond things and it's kind of
like sparkly too this was from Old Navy
and as you can see the tag is still on
here from Old Navy so this is brand-new
this one I think in this summer with
like a jean jacket would be super cute
or a leather jacket even I like the
length of it too it's past my knee
probably not meant to be it's probably
meant to be like up here but on me it's
past my knee but I like it super comfy -
and just flowy this one was originally
35 bucks from Old Navy and I got it for
$13.99 I tried on a few of these for you
guys this one fits super cute I feel
like I'm losing my voice
this is it what this is the second video
I'm filming today and by the way if you
want to know my makeup right now this
eye look is coming in Friday's video but
I did change my lipstick I'm wearing
smashbox always on liquid lipstick and
True Grit love this next one so this is
kind of like a guy style t-shirt dress
kind of looks like you're just wearing
dude shirt okay this one I am in love
with this is right up my alley this
dress this is from forever 21 it was
originally $23 and I got it for $7.99 I
just prayed this with some booties and
then a leather jacket but it's super
cute without the jacket to fuckin get
this off with one hand it's button-up
and it has this pocket right here this
will be super cute in the fall or winter
too with like tights and boots or even
over the knee boots I kind of feel like
I'm wearing pajamas right now with a
dark lip - hell yeah
I kind of just took a chance on these
jeans and actually it worked out in my
favor I've never tried PacSun denim but
these are the PAC's ton jeggings I got a
size 25 and I thought they're gonna be
too small just looking at him but
they're super stretchy and they're
high-waisted so these actually fit
really cute these PacSun jeans are so
stretchy so comfy they're a little bit
long so I'll probably have to get them
hemmed or I can just roll them up I have
to get most of my jeans hemmed but
they're a little bit high waisted so if
I wanted to I could like tuck a shirt in
they're just super comfy and stretchy
these were originally 36 and I got them
for $10.99 $10.99 jeans I was tempted to
get American Eagle because they had tons
of American Eagle on there and I know
how American Eagle fit on me and they
fit really well that's like the majority
of my jeans are American Eagle that's
another good thing if you already know
what size you are and you know a certain
brand fits you really well just go in
there and search by the brand and then
everything that they have will come up
and these look like new I mean you can't
even tell that anyone's worn these they
also had higher-end jeans like they had
seven for all mankind True Religion
brands like that on there too but I'm
glad I tried this out because now I feel
like I want to try more packs on jeans
and then paired with those jeans I tried
on this blazer from forever 21 which
doesn't look like it would be like
Express or something tan blazer but it
has this satin black collar that runs
all the way down which I thought was a
cool touch the blades are super cute too
with this outfit I feel
I probably wouldn't wear a black shirt
under it just because it has this black
trim right here I feel like it kind of
like bleeds into it but with I don't
know what color I'd wear under this
actually maybe like a maroon like a
maroon tank top that would be cute from
forever 21 35 bucks and I got it for
$11.99 I love dressing down a blazer so
just wearing it with this outfit like
with jeans little booties and stuff I
think is a cute look this I was so
freaking excited to see on there because
I had no idea that thredUP carried
fashion OVA in fashion OVA is actually
pretty decent quality I kind of thought
it was gonna be more like a romwe thing
I purchased a few dresses from there and
they're pretty great like that green
velvet one or an Instagram that was from
fashion Nova I also have a red one from
there and there's something about the
way that their products fit that's just
really flattering everything that I
purchased so I was excited when I saw
that they were on thread up this one I
didn't try on because it's a little bit
more risque you know I also love how
they always put the thread up tag on
here because just a nice little touch
and it feels like you're getting
something new in the mail when you open
it this is hella cute it has this lacing
all the way down the front with little
gold rings on it I thought this would be
a cute filming shirt honestly or paired
with a high-waisted skirt or something I
like that this is long-sleeve too if I'm
wearing something like a crop top I
typically like to cover a little bit
more skin somewhere else that's just my
personal preference so either put on
like a jean jacket over it or a little
kimono kind of thing or something but
this was in the size small it was
originally 18 bucks and I got it for
$5.99 and again this looks like it has
barely been worn if at all just love
their packaging and their little
stickers and stuff these are the shoes
these are kid shoes I can fit into a kid
size 2.5 over three usually so believe
these are size yeah these are size three
four they do look a little bit big these
are brand new to still has this TV's tag
on it so the shoes were originally
$14.99 and I got em for $7.99 okay
almost done with the clothes I got some
Victoria's Secret shorts these are just
like workout shorts working out is now a
thing in my life I've been going strong
for about the past five weeks now it's
something that I look forward to now
which I never thought I would say I
think just because I watch blood line
one and they're like we'll put on an
episode but I have been enjoying it
kind of branching out getting some
workout clothes you know really getting
into it so I just got these shorts super
cute blue on the front back up black
black on the back the shorts are
originally $15 and I got them for $4.99
all right it's the last clothing piece I
got is this how am I gonna show this
this dress couldn't try song because I
think it's gonna fit but I think it's
the kind of thing where I'm gonna have
to like full-on pull it over my head and
I didn't want it to mess up all the
makeup you know super cute summer kind
of dress I feel like this is gonna be
flattering because it ties around the
boobage area and it just flows all the
way down I think this was a good brand
yeah this one is Band of Gypsys this was
normally $60 and I got it for 1199
that's what I'm talking about I'm
excited I feel like I got some good
pieces so if you guys want to check out
thredUP I'll have a link in the
description down below but they're
giving you guys 30% off your first order
on thredUP and the code the code is my
favorite part
the code is burrito 30 I think that's my
favorite code I've ever been given they
came up with that not me
so they know you guys alright so now
onto the old two goods I actually placed
a second order but I think that's gonna
be coming in another haul because they
said it was gonna take two weeks to ship
so when wild finally launched new
eyeshadow palettes I feel like it's been
a while since they've launched them
these are their new color icon palettes
I'm a big fan of their old color icon
palettes that they've had for years like
the eight pan I think there's eight in
there so this first one is not a basic
peach and then this one is rosy in the
air does this look familiar so this one
looks very similar to the modern
Renaissance palette by Anastasia Beverly
Hills let me know if you guys want to
see these in like a drugstore first
impressions video or shadow inch movies
or something if they put the prices on
here why do they never put the prices on
the order form well I'll check the
prices and put them on the screen for
you guys this eyelash popping huh so a
lot of you guys have asked to see this
in a foundation Friday so I picked this
up it's the Wet n Wild mega cushion
foundation says it contains natural
coconut derivative has SPF 15 says its
luminous lightweight and buildable
hydrating formulas that sounds exactly
what I need for my skin right now so you
guys will probably be seeing this coming
and the next 15 days the foundation
which is coming up trying my best to do
a half drugstore half high-end about
that
in our last series there was a little
bit more high-end than drugstores just
the way it happened with the new
releases
I heard the feedback from you guys in
this time I'm really trying to make it
half half so let me know what other
drugstore foundations you guys want to
see I did just order the new essence
foundation I have this one I have about
two others right now so I definitely
still need about three or four more
drugstore ones that I haven't reviewed
yet if you leave a suggestion down below
type in the Tayla and the name of the
foundation into the youtube search bar
and see if a review video already pops
up because I've reviewed a shit ton of
drugstore foundations and they don't pop
out releases quite as much as high-end
which is why it's easier to find
high-end releases so let me know down
below more of the story
that was a long foolish feel there oh
I'm hella excited to try this
this is elfs collaboration with heart
it's the coffee and cream highlighter
duo and when I was at their event thing
in LA a couple months ago they were
talking about how quickly this sold out
and how just how much people loved it so
I wanted to give it a go I hadn't tried
it yet and it comes in this really
pretty rose gold packaging there's like
a light white kind of pink shade in here
oh heck yeah I'm excited try this okay
this I am so curious about this is a
brand new makeup revolution conceal and
define full coverage conceal and contour
aka just concealer makeup revolution
typically does kind of do products I'm
not sure if this was supposed to be a
shape tape dupe or why people are
comparing it to that exactly but it says
it's a full coverage concealer so I'm
curious how much product does this have
this has 0.1 one fluid ounces shaped
tape has a shit-ton shape tape has 0.33
so essentially multiply this price by
three and that's what you're paying what
and wild is just popping out the new
releases right now this is the do a face
primer photo focus primer very basic
just like wipe squeeze packaging nothing
super exciting oh it looks like it has a
little bit of color to it has like a
nude tint I don't think it has a scent
any kind of dewy
primer dewy setting spray right now sign
me up another one wild product I went
ham on the wet and wild this is the make
a glow highlighting powder in the shade
golden flower crown I'm not sure if this
is a new shade or if I just never pick
this up I do really like this highlight
in the Pinker shade I don't have a whole
lot of gold highlighters because it's
not usually what I gravitate towards and
they tend to be too dark on my skin tone
this one looks like it might be too
but you can always use it as eyeshadow
or something if it is I've been meaning
to try this for forever like since this
launch this is the LA girl just blushing
blush but it's in the shade just because
and this is a few bucks I want to say
and I want to try this as a contour
shade it looks like it's gonna be a
really nice ashy topi contour shade so
we will see I like the packaging of this
I think they just recently repackaged
these and it has a nice weight to it
feels a lot heavier than I thought it
was going to if you have fair skin this
could potentially be a good contour
shade I do have a video all about my
favorite contour shades for pale skin
this next product is another one that
I've just been meaning to try the NYX
hydro touch powder I got the lighter
shade 0-1 porcelain like I said my skin
is on the drier side normal to dry from
a keychain any kind of hydrating powder
dewy powder those are the ones that I
find typically look better on my skin
right now so I wanted to give this one a
go alright just a couple things left we
have the model's own cover it full
coverage concealer I totally forgot this
is a concealer definitely thought this
is an eye primer this is in the lightest
shade 0-1 light maybe I'll do this
against some makeup revolution one how
much is in this one oh shit this one has
0.28 fluid ounces so quite a bit of
product this one's more of like a
squeeze tube applicator this looks like
it has a wand I'm assuming super cute
packaging on this guy this is the makeup
revolution bronze &amp;amp; Glow powder bronzer
and highlighter duo looks like the
bronzer shade possibly has potential
looks a little bit warm but we'll try it
out I love how they have that imprint on
there like the Kylie products let me
know if there are certain products from
Kylie cosmetics that you think are worth
trying or you want to see in a video I'm
not opposed to buying them I just I
don't know I just always go on there and
then when I'm actually checking out I'm
like I don't want to spend $85 on two
things but congrats Kylie she has a baby
hey I'm kind of curious about her
concealers though alright so that was
everything in my Ulta haul so like I
said I have some more stuff coming from
Ulta a second order there are some
really interesting products in that
order I ordered the Catrice waterproof
drops which is supposed to make like any
foundation waterproof keep an eye out if
