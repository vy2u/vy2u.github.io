all right so today it is day 7 of 15
days of foundation I can't believe or
pretty much halfway there no we are
we're halfway there so where I'm trying
out a new foundation every single day
for 15 days days 1 through 6 link down
below which you could see my outfit
right now I'm wearing a turtleneck a
necklace a leopard robe on my lap pajama
pants
stylin today we're going to be talking
about the ex1 invisi wear liquid
foundation this is a very loved
foundation I hadn't been able to try
this for a while because previously
their lightest shade looked extremely
dark they recently came out with I think
7 new shades they now have 13 shades
total they now have the shade 1.0 which
is what I have if you're pale this one
is light enough hallelujah Thank You ex1
so I'm going to search some swatches of
this foundation compared to some of the
other foundations that I own alright
swatch time I don't know what's going on
with my swatches right now but we're
going to roll with it
right here's the ex1 foundation in 1.0
next one over is Maybelline fit me in
110 Kat Von D lock-it tattoo and l4d2
Revlon Colorstay in 110 and then this is
Urban Decay Naked and 0.5 you get one
fluid ounce of product in here and this
retails for $16 which is really good
pretty much drugstore pricing
I ordered mine awful look fantastic you
can get free shipping on there at 16
bucks super good deal love the packaging
of this rose gold I'm feeling it some
reason this reminds me of like a pumpkin
spice latte I hadn't previously heard of
the brandy x1 so I read a little bit
about their brand and basically it was
founded by a biochemist who wanted to
make foundations for yellow undertones
because obviously that's a little bit
harder to come by a lot of foundation
brands don't have super great yellow
undertone foundations so I think it's
awesome that someone saw that problem
went out and solved it it was developed
in Italy es1 is cruelty free it also is
vegan it says all of their products
except their concealer is vegan this
product doesn't contain animal
derivatives so I'm going to read a
little bit about this actual product it
says it's a lightweight aluminum advise
formulated with light diffusers which
unifies skin tone and cover
imperfections effort
it doesn't say what kind of coverage
this is supposed to have it also doesn't
say if this is supposed to be long
wearing so we'll see how it holds up
throughout the day that's pretty much it
sighs all the claims on here I very
combination acne prone skin if you're
like in 15 days of foundation don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up
the link for your 15 days of foundation
t-shirts are down below half of all
proceeds are being donated to project
beauty share so if you want to see how
the ex1 foundation applies and wears
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching all right I
feel a little out of it right now
because I took a pill this morning but I
am very excited
try the Sun dation I've already washed
moisturize primed my face I have my
dampened Real Techniques sponge right
here and then I'm also going to do the
Sigma f80 on the other side of my face
carpe the diem the dudes were out there
drilling on the window again this
morning which is why it is ten o'clock
right now usually a film at like 7:00
well pretty thick I'm going to start
with that amount about a dime sized
amount and I'm going to go in with the
brush on the side of my face oh the
shade is looking nice super pretty like
luminous finish to this it feels weird
it's thick but it doesn't feel heavy
when you blend it on your face it's like
are you set okay back or is that right
no idea what's going on up there
I use that whole dime sized amount on
half my face and I'm going to go in with
the Real Techniques sponge on the other
side whoa okay off the bat like how it
applies a lot better with a sponge and
the product is going way farther with
the sponge I still have like half that
amount out on the palette sponge was
definitely way quicker application and I
think we got about the same coverage
still looks like coverage but it's
sitting really nicely on my skin so you
just whoops so it didn't really cover
anything down here like I didn't get
good coverage from this but II evened
out my skin tone really well you can
still see the freckles and everything
coming through down here I don't know
why my hair looks Brown in the thing
right now so I am going to go in with a
second layer with this one because I
want to see if it builds and how much
coverage I can get I'm going to use a
sponge for this because I like the spa
application a little bit better with
that second layer I think I'm at about
medium coverage now it did build totally
fine doesn't look heavier anything but I
didn't get a ton of coverage and still
see all the stuff down here so next time
I use this I'd probably spot concealed
first and then go in with just one layer
of the foundation but I really like the
way it's looking on my skin right now
looks very smooth so we're gonna call
the check-in time 10:30 it's 10:25 I'm
going to apply the rest of my makeup and
I'll be right back all right so it is
now 10:50 rest my makeup is on so this
totally totally set like it almost
turned into a satin matte finish is
pretty dewy when it first went on as you
guys saw and as it sets within about 5
to 10 minutes it completely sets you can
blend powder totally fine on top which I
really like everything now it just kind
of looks like satin matte finish not
creasing anywhere not looking weird
anywhere I feel like I've to sneeze I
love the shade of this the only thing
I'm not totally loving is the coverage
just for me it's not enough coverage but
that can be easily fixed with some
concealer next time a zit I'm telling
you guys super quickly what's on the
rest of the face so for eyeshadow I used
a mix of my caridy shadows I really like
these I used what does this one actually
might be makeup geek I throw a few
makeup geek ones in here while I was
traveling so the red shade I used like
in my outer corner is yeah makeup geek
cherry cola my transition shade is cara
de nod and then my lid color is a morphe
press pigment in make a statement this
like dark teal kind of color contour the
shade from the LA Colors palette my
blush was makeup real look look what my
blush was makeup revolution blushing
hearts candy of hearts highlight essence
eyeshadow on snowflake my favorite
Maybelline nude nuance this is one of
the Maybelline matte lipsticks so that
is everything on my face right now I'm
going to check back in a few hours in
natural lighting all right so it's now
338 so the foundation has been on for a
little over 5 hours
kneeling on hardwood floor right now so
I think it still looks pretty good it's
breaking down a tiny bit right on the
center of my forehead
zoom you
and just a little bit right there I
don't know if you guys can see that
looks a little bit heavy right there the
rest of my forehead looks really good my
upper lip does have some creasing right
here and around my nose everywhere else
looks pretty good it looks a little bit
dry my face might just be dry but like
around here a little bit looks kind of
heavy
it doesn't look horrible or anything
there's just certain spots that look a
little bit dry but I'm going to leave
this on and now we'll check back in at
the end of the night all right so it is
now worth the time go it is now 8:30 so
if foundations been on for 10 hours I'm
wrapping up some editing back there so I
hadn't looked at my face since the last
check-in until I just went to put on
lipstick ooh okay so we are extremely
oily pretty much in the entire center of
my face it separated it's breaking down
and it looks super oily it's totally
broken down around here which I usually
don't get I might start setting them
with powder just to see but it's always
so hard because half the time in real
life I don't set my face with a powder I
try and keep these as consistent as
possible so you can see what factors are
kind of going into it but I don't know I
feel like the last four foundations or
five foundations needed to be set with
the powder at the end of the night so I
might start setting them with the powder
I don't know I do have foundations that
I wear that I don't need to so I
definitely would wear this again with
the powder and try it out because I like
the shade of it the shade is like
perfect for me it didn't oxidize
throughout the day I'm definitely gonna
try this out more I think I would spot
conceal first next time and then apply a
setting powder I don't think this is
enough coverage for me off of even two
layers here's the one who likes lighter
coverage you like to medium coverage you
might like this I think this is one of
those I just need to play around with
more I don't hate it I don't love it so
I'll definitely try this out different
ways and up to you guys in the best and
worst a 15 days foundation video that
will come and be out the will coming be
out they'll be coming out after this
series I cannot wait to put on a face
mask right now I need to finish editing
if you like this video in your side
about 15 days Foundation don't forget to
give this a thumbs up band 8 is now
coming off love you guys thanks for
