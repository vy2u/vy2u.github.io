routine which I've been meaning to film
for literally months now I'm kind of
glad I held off because I recently found
a product that I'm freaking obsessed
with and I mention it in this video I've
gotten a lot of questions from you guys
on Instagram to do a brow routine so
we're here and we're doing it I wasn't
planning on filming today but I figured
out how to change the brightness on my
sony and x5t and i got really excited
and i wanted to film so now we're
filming I like it I like it a lot better
than the first time I dried it thumbs up
if you liked the whole video being in
focus for once so if you want to see how
I get my brows you're in the right place
just keep watching I'm like so close to
this ring lame I know so as far as
grooming my brows go I usually just
pluck them using these tweezers I don't
know what brand they are but they're
leopard by default they're amazing I
have like an at-home waxing that I
probably use every two months but
normally I just pluck them and I've been
kind of in the process of reshaping my
brows and I feel like they're finally
getting to how I wanted them if you're
also trying to reshape your brows I
would just let them over grow and then
what I did was drew on my brows the
shape that I would want them and then
plucked around those areas if that makes
sense that's the easiest way to see
because sometimes if you just go in and
pluck without any product on your brows
like I would right now it's kind of
difficult to see the end sheet that you
want so I just go ahead and comb through
this also takes out any powder or
foundation that got on there I know a
lot of people do their brows first but I
always do my brows after my face makeup
is on I know just how to do it
so the first step in my brow routine is
going in with a brow gel this is the
Ulta brow tint how freaking great is
this you can actually see what I'm
talking about so this is the ultra brow
tint as you can see it's a super tiny
brush I also have the benefit gimme brow
here and the brush on this one is
actually a tiny bit bigger I've tried
both of these products and I think I'm
going to do a whole review comparison of
them but I do like the ultra brow in it
a little bit more and it's like six
bucks versus like twenty something I
have the shaded deep and it is literally
the perfect shade for me I'm obsessed
with this thing I like to put it on
first because I feel like I have to use
less brow product afterwards and it just
super naturally fills in your brows I
print the NYX brow gel is also
so I just like to usually start about
right here I don't like to start at the
front and my brows because we don't want
tons of product to be placed right at
the front so I just kind of go in and
follow the natural shape of my brows I
usually don't go too far down on the
tail because I like a sharper tail which
is what we're going to do after this so
then whatever is left over I just put a
tiny bit on the front and brush upwards
if you leave your friend kind of
untouched your brows just look a lot
more natural and less like penciled in
so as you can see it does a pretty good
job of filling everything in some days
when I'm just running out to do errands
and I don't want to like put my whole
bra on I'll just use the brow gel and
it's doable I'll just extend it a little
bit more I feel like I look green right
now I love this Ulta one because it
dries fast so I can go in directly
afterwards with product so if you get a
little splotch like that sometimes
happens I'll just go back in with my
spoolie huerta just with it I'll just go
back in with this fully and just blend
that out all right so then what I do is
go in with anastasia dipbrow pomade and
this is in the shade dark brown I have
one shade up from this and it's just a
little bit too dark for me I find that
this shade is perfect and it doesn't
have too much red in it my Holy Grail
eyebrow brush you need this in your life
if you're looking for a good eyebrow
brush is the Sedona lace 561 it just
looks like this it has a really nice
fine point at the end it just makes
doing your brows super easy I always
like to go ahead and clean it offer so I
just take a baby wipe and kind of rub
the product off of there I think the
trick with the like I'm yelling right
now I think the trick with the brow is
kind of the way that you get the product
on the brush I used to get way too much
on the brush and it just makes your
brows look completely penciled in and
fake so what I like to do now is get my
brush in here and I kind of like to only
coat the tip and then what I do is go
into the lid and just kind of go like
that and get some of it off and then run
it through one time I don't know why
that works for me but that system just
like gets the perfect amount
product on the brush so since we have
like 90% of our brows have done right
now
all i use anastasia dipbrow for is just
the tail end and i feel like that just
really cleans everything up so i just
like to get the kind of shape that i
like sometimes it turns out sometimes it
doesn't you never really know when
you're going to have a good bra day so I
usually start right at the arch of the
brow and just only underline the bottom
I'm just taking a little bit more
product and it's okay if it's not as
sharp as a point that you want it to be
where that's why we're going to go in
with concealer afterwards once I have
the tail kind of filled in how I like it
I just take a tiny bit of whatever is
left over in the lid and then follow
your natural hairs and I just like to do
super light strokes to fill this part in
so the shape might be a little bit off
or not exactly how you like it I just
like to overdo it and then I go back in
and clean it up with concealer
so again just kind of doing short light
strokes following the hair I usually
like to fill in a little bit more arch
on the top so I usually look straight on
at the mirror and see kind of what
adjustments I need to make so once we're
done with the dipbrow stage I like to
take a concealer my favorite one to
carve out my brows is the NARS vanilla
concealer this is perfect for carving
out your brows is super full coverage
the shade is perfect matched my skin
tone it's not too light and it's not too
dark it's just easy to work with it
covers up all the brow product so I
usually just take the doe foot
applicator I just put a little bit on my
palette which is dirty right now because
I just did my foundation you don't need
a lot of this at all it's pretty
freaking full coverage and then the
brush I use is the Sedona lace EB 11
brush it's basically just a round tip
concealer brush coat both sides of the
brush like this and get the tip really
good in there go ahead and kind of clean
up the edges I usually like to start on
the under side
and I'll go in with a little bit for the
top I don't usually like to spring it
all the way in I kind of just do the end
all right so that's basically what I do
sometimes if I like overdid a little bit
with the concealer I'll just go back in
with the brush and just add a tiny bit
more color it is like 50 times harder to
do this on camera than when I do it on a
daily basis like I'm gonna
something up alright so this is
basically how my brows look when they're
done you have your good broad days and
you have your not-so-good brow days so
sometimes I feel like they turn out
really great and sometimes it's just not
your day you know this is what the brows
look like with the rest of my makeup on
my makeup details for the rest of my
face and eyes and everything will be
listed down below in case you want to
