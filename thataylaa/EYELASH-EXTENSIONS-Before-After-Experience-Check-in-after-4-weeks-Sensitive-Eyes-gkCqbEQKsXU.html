about to get lash extensions I'm very
excited it's my first time ever getting
lash extensions I have super sensitive
eyes lash glue usually irritates the
crap out of my eyes so I've been kind of
hesitant to try lash extensions but a
lady that I found says that she has a
technique that's good for sensitive eyes
I'm helping them I don't get irritated
and we're all good so I'm gonna vlog the
process and by time you guys are seeing
this video I love actually already had
them for a month because I want a
document as the time goes on so you can
see how they fall out and just how they
wear one of my main reasons for getting
these right now is that I'm going to be
traveling pretty much all of May so I
just don't want to fuss with makeup and
I figured since I'm not filming as much
in May all the videos you guys have been
seeing are pre-recorded it's just a good
time to try them out so place I'm going
to is called lash lounge North West
there in Lynwood which is like 25
minutes away from Seattle and her
Instagram looked really good I just
liked their style I'm going to show you
guys before of my lashes are now I'm not
wearing any makeup unsub's concealed on
my acne I filmed a shadow and schmooze
this morning and I did wear false lashes
so I tried to get all the lash glue off
really well I need to pluck my eyebrows
what's new we can just ignore that but
here's what my life should look like
before do a side shut so I'm going to
last check-ins every couple weeks and
then at the end of this I'll show you
what my lashes look like and if I decide
to get a fill or not I'm here a little
early and I'm starving
kind of want to go get Taco Bell so I'm
really willing to the place I'm getting
it done out down below with their
contact info and Instagram and
everything if you want to check them out
this shouldn't be a chilled log style
video documenting my process and
experience
you know your face is kind of crooked go
home oh yeah when you do a sale do you
redo like the whole everything basically
I just like filling the gap I'm just um
the ones that have basically grown out
more than two millimeters the ones that
are kind of closer to your lash line I
leave them and they just all blend in
together to ruin that gotten eyelash
extensions absolutely love them and I
feel like I'm going to be addicted yeah
there is such an addiction or some type
of list that we're doing I always start
out with those longer links first or
names the suitable link that you'd like
and then gonna start a little blueprint
and I'm gonna work my way down with both
sizes - these are called volume lashes
the style that we're doing is more like
a staggered volumes like wispy to
Porsche why does it take the Rushford a
couple seconds and safety three seconds
Oh
we're in it for
so hope right
Jason is kill Adela notice right bones
let me go okay ready
oh my gosh throw cool I'm gonna so good
I'm chill it's like a new factory with a
dictionary yeah it's weird they feel
like super-lightweight yeah
doesn't feel like yeah okay so I just
got done and I love them it is so crazy
it doesn't feel anything like having
false lashes on it feels way more
lightweight it feels like nothing I can
feel them it's like sitting my brows and
I look up but you can't actually feel
anything and my eyes actually didn't
burn it all they're not red right now so
that's a good sign
this one hurt a little bit right when I
opened my eyes just cuz there was still
some glue here's a close-up right I
really got to put my brows sorry guys
Pauline did amazing thank you I totally
fell asleep during the middle of it it's
like super therapeutic and relaxing and
she's had good jams going I love this
separated this and I feel like they're a
nice mix not too much you know I'm
saying I got the volume lashes but
volume wispy so they're more separated
you set me back with this little package
thing that has instructions about
aftercare basically just as you can't
get them wet for 24 hours obviously no
like oil makeup remover and stuff like
that cute little mascara once they're so
cute so I will update you guys how they
wear and what I think of them and just
how it goes like wearing makeup and
everything so I'll check in with you
soon alright so the next day and I just
want to do a quick check-in so you guys
can see how lashes are doing with the
full face of makeup on I am loving them
when I found my foundation I usually
blend over my eyes so with the lashes I
didn't do that I was just more careful
to put it like on my eyelid just in my
face is the same color but here's what
they look like I love them it was so
nice not having to put all my scare or
anything I didn't put any on the bottom
lashes just because I wanted to give my
eyes a little break
my eyes feel totally fine right now last
night they felt a little bit irritated I
think I had some glue like on the corner
of my eye right here but they weren't
red or bloodshot or anything right now
they feel totally fine and don't feel
anything
so if you guys to give you another
update all right so I want to do a
little lash update since the lashes have
officially been on for almost
exactly four weeks about three and a
half weeks and I wore them throughout my
two-week trip I just got back yesterday
that's when it was the same as the
ending clip in the Taiwan vlog actually
you guys might be seeing this video
first I think you will be but I wanted
to do a check-in because tomorrow I
actually get my lashes filled so the
only time that Pauline could get me in
before I leave again
so I actually feel like I don't really
need to get them filled right now I feel
like I could go another like week or two
even because they're holding up really
well I'm going to zoom you guys in my
face looks ratchet right now because I'm
majorly jet-lagged but here you go as
you can see they are still totally on
and going strong this is after like I
said almost four weeks which i think is
great I do feel like they've send out a
little bit especially on like the outer
portions but for the most part maybe it
was because when I was traveling I
literally was wearing super minimal
makeup like no eye makeup and a lot of
days no foundation so I wasn't really
like tugging out my eyes at all I wasn't
really washing them at all a couple
things I'm assuming out like couple
things that I noticed I wanted to
mention to you guys one I noticed that
with my eyes particularly like I said I
have sensitive eyes the glue has been
totally fine I haven't notice any kind
of reaction to the glue except when I
fully wet my face I briefly avoid
getting my eyes totally wet even when
I'm like I was watching an emotional
vlog last night and I started tearing up
it someone's wedding video started
tearing up and even then I noticed my
eyes burning but I definitely noticed
when I full-on wash my face and wet my
eye area my eyes made really burned the
other thing I wanted to point out is
that if you're someone who likes to wear
a lot of eyeshadow and eyeliner and
everything they are a tiny bit hard to
work with with the lashes you definitely
have to be careful because you can't put
mascara anything on over them so if
you're getting shadow on top of the
lashes or foundation on top of them
you'll just have to go in and like clean
them off with like a q-tip or something
which probably will be more of an issue
for me when I start filming and stuff
again since all the videos were
pre-recorded I really like them I love
that I can just get up and go especially
with the permanent brows plus with
mascara or anything like that I'm
getting them filled like I said tomorrow
so I'll definitely have them on for at
least another four weeks some people say
that your lash just completely fall out
with the extensions I haven't noticed
that but again I still have them on so I
don't really know what that will look
like
until they do flour until I get them
removed but right now I'm super happy
with them I'm loving them I will show
you guys one more clip tomorrow after I
get them filled just so you can see what
they look like I think I want to do a
little bit shorter and length right it's
the next day and I want to show you guys
what my lashes look like now that I just
got them filled literally just walked in
the door leaving for Portland in like
two minutes here's what they look like I
told Pauline I wanted them a tiny bit
shorter and I think she nailed it I love
them
I'm going to start a photo right here
that Pauline posted on her Instagram
that shows what my lashes looked like
before she did the spell she said that
it was like amazing retention probably
because I wasn't using literally
anything on my eyes or face I got only
Pauline's Instagram down below if you
guys are in the Washington area and you
want to go I don't think I mentioned to
beginning this I can't remember but she
did give me a coupon if you guys
mentioned my name you'll get a discount
we were happy with them I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and found it helpful
if you did make sure you give it a
thumbs up love you guys thanks for
watching to my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
