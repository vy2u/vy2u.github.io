getting my lash extensions filled I
thought it would do kind of an update
video on what I think the lash
extensions now that I've had them for a
while or like gotten them again after
the first time I got them and just let
you know my thoughts on it and also do
you like a Q&amp;amp;A kind of thing so I'm
gonna be answering a bunch of your
questions from Twitter and snapchat I'm
reeling my original video down below
because that really documents everything
like the actual process I did a
four-week check-in so you can see how
they actually where this video is gonna
be more like how I feel about them now
what products I use how I get the best
for attention with them a zoomed you in
so you can see my lashes as we're
talking about this so just to catch you
guys up back in May I got lash
extensions for the first time because I
was gonna be traveling so I got a full
set and then I got one fill and then
after that I did not get them again
because just with filming and stuff and
doing makeup all the time it's just not
very practical which is why I haven't
gotten them again until now and I wanted
to get them again because again I'm
gonna be traveling I don't know it's
just really nice when you're traveling
because I'm you have to worry about
makeup as much and my eyes get really
irritated with false lashes so if I'm
going to be going to like an event or
something I don't know just I don't do
wear false lashes the whole day they're
just really nice to have on I got the
full set done about three weeks ago and
I just got the fill today because I
leave for the trip tomorrow so I just
wanted to get them like fresh you know
but I probably could have gone about
another week I'm gonna insert footage
right here as you guys can see before
from this morning and then what they
look like now okay so I'm about to go in
and get my lashes filled to have a
cooler after drop off at friends but I
want to show you guys before I get the
fill what they look like this was after
three weeks I want to say I didn't take
that good of care of them this time
because I was doing a ton of pre
recording and stuff so I was like
wearing eye shadow everyday so here's
what they look like before I'm getting
them filled I did kind of a curly thing
last time I think I want to go back to
the other style you guys will have
already seen them but I like them a
little bit more like separated and wispy
and stuff here's the before you can see
a little side wait maybe you can't there
we go side profile curl going on here's
what the lashes look like after I told
her I wanted a little bit more length
and like separated then the first time I
got them going so one of the questions
that a bunch of you guys asked is what
style do I get so the style that I
get I think the best way is just to show
your lash technician a photo of what you
want your lashes to look like so that's
what I do by the way I go to lash lounge
Northwest I'll have that Instagram link
down below holiness who owns a that's
how I usually go to but she's actually
having a baby Congrats Pauline so she's
gonna be gone but Roseann is the new
girl and she is really good as far as
what I can tell from Instagram like her
photos look a bomb of the lashes so I'll
have their info listed down below but
that's where I go so if you're in
Seattle Lynwood is like 20 minutes away
so not bad at all so before we go into
the specific questions that you guys
have
I love lash extensions I think if I
wasn't filming and stuff I would just
keep them on all the time they are
pretty high maintenance and they're not
cheap so those are two things to keep in
mind if you're thinking about getting
them I think it's worth it to get even
just for one time or to get them one
time and then I feel like for a special
event or traveling or whatever just if
you want your lashes to be a little
something extra but they are super
expensive if you're gonna keep them up
regularly because you do have to get
fills like every three to four weeks I'm
gonna have like a price range on the
screen for how much fills are in full
sets typically like on average the whole
process takes about two to three hours
for the full set the fill takes about an
hour and a half I think yeah I think it
was there for about an hour and a half
maybe a little over an hour so it is
time consuming and you can't like work
or anything while you're doing it like
when you get your hair done because your
eyes have to be closed so you kind of
just have to like chill I usually take a
nap I actually sleep really good in
there because she has like good music
going and a really comfy bed and I just
like pass the out so let's hop on
to Twitter and answer some of your
questions my twitter is the Tayla I'm
going to put my social handles right
here so if the next time I do something
like this you can ask questions if you
want to okay so Erin walk me says do you
suggest them for someone who has very
very sensitive eyes like I touched on in
the first video I have super sensitive
eyes I usually can't keep strip lashes
on for more than like an hour too
they've just never been comfortable my
eyes they always burn and I just get
super red and like irritated with lashes
pulling mixes and pretty sure the normal
lash glue with a lash glue for sensitive
eyes so personally it doesn't affect me
at all the only time I noticed like I
said in the other videos when I
shower like if I'm gonna fully wet my
face my eyes do burn when I like fully
get the lashes wet but I don't do that
every time I shower we'll talk about
that don't for me as someone who has
sensitive eyes it's been totally fine
for the most part the glue isn't on your
skin like it is with the strip lash so I
think that might have something to do
with it because you're putting the lash
glue on your lash not on your skin so
probably the most asked question was
have you noticed a difference in your
natural lashes like more falling out so
something I didn't realize when you get
a fill I was thinking like when you get
a fill it's never gonna be as full as
your original set and that might be true
because you probably do have a few less
lashes but pulling you know saying that
your lashes cycle through so like you
have new ones coming out as your other
ones are falling out so I will say since
I didn't get to touch on this in the
last video I kind of let them fall out
towards the end because I wanted I
didn't want to get them again I did
definitely notice for about a week or
two my eyelashes were way shorter than
before I got false lashes but they grew
back literally within a week keep in
mind my hair grows super fast like I
have very fast growing body hair maybe
that had something to do with it but if
you're fine with having like a little
bit of a period where your lashes are
shorter before your new ones grow back
in personally doesn't bother me that
much but I definitely did notice that my
natural lashes for a period of time were
way shorter Oh calamity excess how do
you go wearing glasses with lash
extensions so I don't wear glasses so
I'm not sure but I have sunglasses and
for me when I have my glasses on my
sunglasses they don't touch at all
especially this set because this time
around I got like more curled ones the
first time I got more lengthy ones but
that's the cool thing with lash
extensions is that it's pretty much
totally customizable for what you want
so if you wear glasses just tell them
that and they'll probably be able to do
a shorter length so they don't hit the
glasses Katie says what kind of
application do you get I see a lot of
stuff about classic 2d 3d Russian etc
well I heard about Russian so I get
staggered volume wispy is what I usually
get except last time so like this set
the previous full set that make any
sense so the first time I got them I got
staggered rolling must be I loved that
style the second time I got the full set
which was just a few weeks ago I told
her I wanted them
just like shorter and more curled on my
eye shape I feel like that wasn't the
most flattering so I think I'm gonna go
back when I do next time I'll go back to
the stack or volume wispy so right now I
have kind of a combo of the two Kathryn
says do you just let them go and get it
done all over again or can you fill the
ones that fall out certain areas like
and upkeep yeah so there's full set and
then a fill so you could technically let
all of them fall out it's kind of like
acrylic nails if you wanted to get a
fresh set you could just let them all
like you know take them off or lemon
grout whatever and then get a full fresh
set or you could keep up with the fill
so you don't have to get a full set a
full set for lash extensions is way more
expensive than getting fills so
financially it probably makes sense to
just keep up with it if you're gonna be
doing it for a long period of time but
again like I do I'll probably just do
full set fill break full set fill this
is a good question
meg says what's the worst thing about
having the extensions in for me I think
the most annoying thing is that well two
things one if you're someone who does a
full glam like eye shadow liner all that
you definitely can get them just keep in
mind that they're probably gonna fall
out faster and it's also just a little
bit hard doing makeup because you can't
really see as well like when you're
actually doing your eye shadow and stuff
because you look straight on and you see
like lashes you don't actually see the
shadow that makes em so the worst thing
for me I think is like washing my face I
love that feeling of like wiping off
your eye makeup and using like an oil or
like just really like cleaning your face
and with lash extensions it's just a
little bit tricky I still obviously wash
my face I just kind of go around you
know my eyes completely and I can't like
full-on splash water on it you could but
for me the last loop and it burns when I
do that I definitely clean my eyes I'm
gonna get to that next also I shadow can
kind of get in them it's kind of hard to
get eyeshadow out so that leads us into
the next question
the maintenance what do I use to clean
them and what makeup remover that was
asked a lot so I use my normal makeup
remover which is the Neutrogena oil-free
makeup remover wipes I really like those
with the lash extensions because I can
just kind of like push down the lash
with one hand and then I'll just wrap
the wipe around my finger and I just get
like really close to the lash line
without actually getting the lashes and
just kind of like slowly really gently
like wipe off my eye makeup and also
things
you can't be like super rough you kind
of just have to be slow everything takes
longer and then Pauline actually gives
me this cleaner I'm not actually sure
what the cleaner is I'm not sure if most
places have that or give you it but it
has like her own label on it so I
actually don't know what it is but it
kind of bounces the pH in your eyes it
removes makeup it's just what she gives
people to take care of them so I use
that I don't use it every day I probably
use it like every couple days bridgett
says when you pick lash extensions over
applying strip lashes I think again it's
totally dependent on you and your
lifestyle how much makeup you wear if
lash glue irritates you Julien says what
does it feel like to get the extension
so I'm assuming like the actual process
what does it feel like I'm like passed
out for most of it but it just feels
like someone is like lightly touching
your lashes it's literally all it feels
like Caitlin Lloyd asked a bunch of good
questions and I think this is the last
one that we're going to answer she said
do they look weird once they start
falling out I feel like they can
definitely look a little bit sparse like
a little bit weird of course everyone's
are gonna fall out differently but I
think if you're letting them fall out
and you're not gonna get a fill you
could probably just wear like strip
lashes while they fall out just put on
like liner or something so it's not as
noticeable does it make your eye heavy
no that's one of the things that I hate
about false lashes I feel like it just
makes my eyes feel like strained almost
and with lash extensions they feel super
lightweight again since there's no band
on there I don't really notice them on
my face at all only when I like look up
sometimes and if it'll like touch my
brow or something other than that I like
forget that they're on alright so I
think that's all the questions school
bus if you guys have any other questions
you can leave them down below in the
comments I've had really positive
experiences with lash extensions both
times so it is something that I would
keep doing for special occasions or
whatever if you guys enjoyed this video
