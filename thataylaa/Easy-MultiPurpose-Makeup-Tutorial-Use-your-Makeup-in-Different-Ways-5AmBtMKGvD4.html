the look I'm wearing right now and like
sliding off this chair right now the
hairs different we'll get into that so
I've never really seen one of these
videos before and I figured it might be
fun you don't need to spend a ton of
money buying 50 different makeup
products you can use the same product
for a lot of different things so I'm
just going to show you guys how I use
the same product for multiple different
purposes we're going to do this look
this is a talk-through shadow and
schmoozed style video so if you guys
like shadow and schmooze and you want to
see more let me know by giving this
video a thumbs up my arms are so sore
from Jillian Michaels it literally hurts
to like lift up an eyeshadow brush right
now if you want to see how I got this
look you're in the right place just keep
watching all right this is fun I'm
excited this is my first video filming
back from Iceland and Norway and be
having a whole travel blog coming soon I
 ton of footage till I go through an
edit so that is coming but different
hair this is not my real hair
unfortunately this is the wig I am
thinking of adding like silver and gray
to my hair so I'm just playing around
it's makeup it's hair it's fun who cares
I'm a little shoebox with makeup to use
today this is what life's coming to so
this is kind of like a how to use
products multiple ways video I think a
lot of people think you need twenty five
thousand different things of makeup if
you're on a budget or you're running out
the door or you need like a quick makeup
routine using the same product for
multiple things can be super helpful so
I'm just going to put makeup on my face
and share with you guys how I use
products in different ways did already
do my face and I'm glad I didn't film it
because not a fan of this combo I
started out with mixing the L'Oreal
infallible Pro with this new este edit
flash illuminator
I thought it would be good because it
was darker and this is a little bit too
light for me but it just like didn't mix
well all and I think this foundation is
like I just need to trash this it's like
way cool and so then I ended up adding
some of the Tarte Double Wear double
duty whatever this is gel foundation
over top which kind of worked but I just
feel like I have 10,000 layers of makeup
on my face I'm not sure this video will
be up first but if it is I'll leave it
down below I did a whole first
impression review
on this foundation not gonna lies what
is Perdue toasty so I clearly have my
brows on right now I'm going to go ahead
and shape them a little bit by adding
this cover effects a perfect pencil
crayon this is new from them it comes in
ten different shades which is pretty
cool and I have the shade nnx light and
this is pelo princess friendly I was
super happy that this shade is actually
light enough for me I've been using this
on my waterline you can use this to
carve out your brows which is what we're
going to do today and also around your
lips to shape it up like your lipstick
or whatever it's waterproof so it stays
on your waterline really nicely and I'm
just a fan of this shade this is only 20
bucks on Sephora or you can get on the
cover FX website which I thought is
pretty good considering that you can use
it for like three or four different
things so I'm going to go ahead and just
outline my brow to give it some more
definition and it feels really nice and
creamy but not like too creamy where
it's sliding all over the place you know
I mean now you can just go ahead and
blend it out with your finger BAM
we have brows I'm not going to add it to
the top because I think this shade is a
tiny bit too light for the foundation
I'm wearing right now and we can ignore
my nails I haven't fixed him since I got
back from a trip yet I've literally been
running around like a crazy person this
is Saturday today and I'm filming three
videos and I have four videos to edit
welcome to the weekend so I'm going to
use concealer for a eye primer concealer
a lot of times but seriously just as
good as using eye primer on your eyelids
and my favorite concealer to use for
this is the maybelline instant age
rewind for while I was using this as my
concealer like every day and it just
preps the eyes really nicely it doesn't
crease and I think that's what you have
to be careful about if you use a
concealer to prime your eyes just make
sure that it's not a concealer that will
crease on you so for eyes and to contour
my face and use the it cosmetics my
sculpture face palette they just came
out with a new version of this which I
haven't tried yet I still have a lot of
product in here so I'm just going to
keep using this one this is my fave
Condor shade of life if you have pale
skin you seriously need this this
highlighter and this are beautiful I'm
going to go ahead and contour my face
first maybe here let's do the eyes and
see how let's do the eyes so to start
out I'm going to put probably this color
in the crease taking the morphe 27 in
the whole elite collection I'm not sure
if it'll still be on sale in the city of
Gazette but it was on sale for a 40% off
so you can get all these brushes for
like $4 which is like awesome I have a
video on my favorite makeup brushes so I
shall link that down below and using a
contour shade or a bronzer in your
crease is literally what I do every
single day for work if I am wearing eye
shadow it's just so easy and a lot of
times they blend out easier than eye
shadows in my opinion if you don't have
time to go digging through your drawers
for likes eyeshadow colors just use the
same thing that you put on your face so
this guy is one of my favorite products
of life this is a Physicians Formula
warm nude shimmer strip brick and over
my brow it's actually called you can use
this as an eye shadow a bronzer a blush
highlight literally whatever you want
this is such an amazing product I took
this on my trip with me and it was
literally the only eye shadow I brought
like I didn't bring my eyeshadow palette
at all
I didn't bring a highlight I use this
every single day
do you actually look beautiful on the
lid they want to go in with this if one
of these shades are here let's just
blend gonna put some lid when I go back
into the my scope to face palette and
take this dark brown shade right here
this is great for adding some dimension
to your eyeballs and I'm just putting
this straight into the crease so I was
traveling by myself I did a lot of like
thinking a long time thinking and I did
a ton of brainstorming for YouTube and
just should I want to do and I'm super
excited I'm feeling like very
re-energized and inspired and excited
about YouTube which is always good
because it is really easy to kind of get
in a creative rut I'm going to take the
highlighter in this palette and
you're just gonna pop this right on the
center of the eyeball yeah off bringing
this all the way inwards but mostly just
putting it on the center for the lower
lash line I'm going to take this warmer
brown shade right here and blend this on
the lower lash line so now I'm going to
go back in with the coverfx pencil and
put this on the waterline if you put a
nude color or white color on your
waterline it really helps to open up
your eyes and make them look super break
break and like I said this stays on the
waterline really well my eyes also get
red super easily so I feel like putting
a nude eyeliner on the waterline helps
make me look not so like sleepy and
bloodshot I'm going to be putting lashes
on today so I'm just gonna be blending a
little bit of eyeliner on my top lash
line and to do this you can just use any
kind of route product you have I'm just
taking the dip brow and granted today
colour-pop makes a really cheap brow
pomade I just couldn't get mine open
because their lids are freaking glued on
there but I'm just going to dip into the
shade it's like a dark black ish brown
color and i'm using the morphe m51 5
brush is just super tiny brush and I'm
just smudging this onto the lash line
like I said I'm gonna be putting on
pretty dramatic lashes so I don't need a
whole lot of eyeliner I'm putting this
mostly on the outer half of my eye okay
I'm going to put a coat of mascara on
super quick I feel like I'm forgetting
something oh actually first I want to
put something on the inner corner of my
eyes I think where to use the Physicians
Formula thing again and where's my brush
this doesn't have black on it this brush
is just like stain so I'm just going to
go in with the super white shade right
here and this is a perfect highlight for
the face we might use it today and just
put that right on the inner corner look
at how pretty that is can you guys see
that
so anyone else freaking hate that
periscope sound while I'm waiting for
the eyelashes to dried before I put in
falsies I'm going to go in to contour my
face back with this bad boy I'm gonna
try out this brush I've never used the
m5 30 with this and I think
we use this like one time to contour so
let's try it out
my sisters are so dang close okay I'm
kind of really feeling this hair color
what do you guys think this shut down my
hair its color or not I like going in
with this shade this highlight is so
underrated this is like one of the
prettiest highlight highlighters ever
like look are we seeing that people I'm
also going to take that down the bridge
of my nose just whatever is left over
and then on the Cupid's bow for blush
you can take this in here the shade in
here if you wanted to but I feel like
that might be too much shimmer so I'm
going to take a matte blush I'm using
the makeup revolution trip blush palette
in the shade sugar and spice this has
some really nice blush shades there's
also a couple highlights or like blush
Stoppers I feel like I mean my skin tone
I probably want to use that as a
highlight but it's nice to just put over
blush you're going to use this shade
right here and these are pretty
pigmented so you just need a little bit
this is a really nice just like neutral
shade there's like getting stuck in my
armpit alright I think the lashes are
dry for lashes today I'm using the
eyelash e seducer I've never tried this
for him before I think I got these off
of pot look which is Northshore / tail
side I'll leave it down below basically
I go in there every single day and you
can find like really good deals on
makeup and home stuff and clothes even
how to trim these because they look
pretty wide so I'm going to trim them
and we'll be right back okay so lashes
are on I am feeling these lashes I feel
like they're nice and fluttery but not
too much and I just put some mascara on
my bottom lashes so Urban Decay came out
these new vice lipsticks so I figured
that I would try this guy out this isn't
a shade naked the liner and lipstick
definitely a little bit more coral than
I thought yeah this is a pretty orange e
nude not sure about this color let's see
how the lipstick is I might want to add
like a pinky lip gloss or something over
top woo the formula looks really nice
it's like a nice Sun okay I'm gonna
add something over the top of this
definitely want more of an ood so I'm
going to add some of this maybelline 860
smooth taupe over the top and I just
enjoy light this out oh there we go I'm
going to go back in with the coverfx
pencil and outline lipstick on the deep
I'll line my lips with this this is
really nice because I have kind of like
a double lip which I usually line over
but if there's still some redness or
something peeking through I can conceal
it with this and it's really nice I do
lip piercing or a lip ring this is great
because I can actually clean up around
there and also conceal blemishes with
this let's just try it out actually
still want my lips a little bit more
nude okay I just dab that a little bit
and I'm going to go back and with this
smooth taupe and see if we didn't get it
lighter now that I don't have that other
thing underneath it go in with the
makeup revolution palette again and use
this shade right here and just put this
right on the center of my lips this will
help your list look a little bit more
full and plump also helps to mattify
your lipstick a little bit if you have
kind of a glossy lip or satin lipstick
that you're wearing and you want to just
make it stay a little bit longer and
mattify it you can just add an eyeshadow
or blush or whatever overtop alright so
