mating and egg mcmuffin right now all
right so today we have a shadow moves on
the look I'm wearing right now did a
emerald green kind of Goldy smoky eye
you send me stuff in this video try not
to L'Oreal brand-new eyeshadows also
trying out the julep beauty box this is
freaking awesome
most people know Jolla for their nail
polishes which I love I post on
Instagram about but they also have some
really good makeup which I feel like is
totally underrated basically the jewel
beauty box is a good way to try out
their makeup you get three products
every month you can customize it you can
choose which products you want and you
basically save a ton of money
you're getting three products for $24.99
I do have a 50% off your first box code
which means you'll get three products
for $12 which is insane for 12 bucks I
think it's totally worth giving it a
shot the three products that were in my
box I use today the lip mousse which I'm
wearing right now they're gel eyeliner
and then the eye shadow 101 stick so I'm
wearing all those on my face right now
you'll see how they go on and apply I've
mentioned some jewel products in
favorites before I really like their
glycolic and scrub it is amazing if you
can throw that in there do it obsessed
with these lip news's definitely we're
throwing these in so again if you want
to check it out I'll leave it in the
description box along with a 50% off
code so if you want to see how I got
this look you're in the right place just
keep watching all right it is Saturday
feeling good
got the coffee probably need some more
coffee right now so I've already
moisturized my face I'm going to go in
with the Nivea post shave balm and this
is a men's aftershave balm that is like
blowing up on YouTube right now from
nikkietutorials and I've been using this
everyday for about almost two weeks now
and it's legit you guys it has a
different in it so it basically acts as
an adhesive for your makeup smells so
good
smells like a dude under $200 from the
drugstore from Target I actually feel
like this helps keep my makeup on longer
you want to wait until it gets really
sticky like this and then you can go in
with your foundation so I think today
I'm gonna mix these two foundations this
is the Lancome teint Idole ultra with
Too Faced Born This Way
I'll have the shades and everything
listed down below I haven't done a full
review on this but I've used it multiple
videos and I have a full review on this
foundation I haven't actually makes
these two together before so hopefully
it's a good combo this one is a little
bit too yellow for me and then this one
is super light in pink so let's see if
we can get a nice neutral shade going
and I'm trying out the morphe eg-6 brush
I got these from a hot look and they
were like eight dollars or something I
got a couple of them so hopefully like
it they look really small but I know
this will see I think we're gonna do
like an emerald pennant smokey eye today
L'Oreal if you watched my strobe which
is the live streaming thing yeah this
brushed field is very small got some
major acne going on it it's not to start
little you guys it's like one week it'll
start clearing up and then the next week
it's horrible again okay
I kind of feel like that's just like a
lot of work like this is a really small
brush yeah I'm gonna switch brushes I'm
gonna switch to my ELF selfie brush this
is actually a powder brush but it's
amazing for liquid foundation and it's
like three dollars so you can't go wrong
what were you just talking about feeling
great talking cause I'm good oh yeah
strobe so I did I've been doing a couple
live streams on strobe which is a new
platform if you guys didn't tune in you
can still watch the like re-run of it I
guess on strobe so I'll link it in the
description box I've just been really
enjoying it like it's so cool getting
tonight you guys people like in the chat
or becoming friends with each other
which i thought was really cool so I
feel like I've been talking you guys
even had a lot of you guys didn't watch
the stream so if you want to know what's
going on in life and just I answered a
ton of questions and everything so you
can go watch that if you missed it if
you like this color is actually perfect
like it matches my neck exactly like a
lot of this stuff I already talked about
so I talked about row but this is my
favorite concealer lately one of them
this is the Rimmel lasting perfection
16-hour
concealer in the lightest shade and
Shannon EXO mention this and heard
to our favorites you can't get it in the
US or I haven't been able to find it in
u.s. so I had to order it off of ebay
like Australia or something it is so
bomb I love the color of it perfect for
my skin tone because it has like
definitely more of a pinky tone to it
which I just feel like is super
flattering for underneath my eyes for
some reason it's really nicely good
coverage a side note don't know why this
just popped in my head but I watched my
arms last night because ever since I'm
living in Jordan and my host mom waxed
my arms like the first day I got there
I'm thinking whoever told you guys this
it was good time here she told me my arm
hair looked like a garden loved her and
ever since then I've been like waxing or
shaving my arms but I haven't waxed them
in a really long time and I just really
like it like I like having no hair on my
body waxing your arms is like super
normal in other countries so I don't
know why it's so weird here but anyways
I'm thinking about doing a more in-depth
like hair removal video because I do
remove hair everywhere on my body would
you guys be interested in seeing that
let me know I am studying the under eye
with this stargazer powder super and we
found this online it's basically a white
powder but I like it because it's not
super chalky like every other white
powder I found and it has just enough
color where as you can see it like
brightens the under eye and sets
everything but it doesn't like stark
white so I'm actually really liking this
if I can find the website a link below
not sure if I want to set the rest of my
face kind of feeling like the glowy look
there's like my lashes vertical browser
on I've been using a combo of the etude
house drawing eye pencil I've mentioned
before this is super affordable and it's
amazing with the Ardell dark brown brow
pomade and then I top it off with ultra
brow shadow I plucked my brows before
this video because last video the for
kidding brow police were out to party
you don't always have time to pluck your
brows people I think my foundation is
starting to set let's prime the eyes
first and then I'll go on to face or
maybe we'll do eyes and then yeah let's
do eyes first and then we'll do the rest
of the face today
so I'm trying out this Oprah eye primer
for the first time ever I'm usually not
a fan of these like liquidy kind of
primaries like
okay I feel like it just takes away from
coverage on my eyes sometimes
so think I'm gonna try a bunch of morphe
brushes that I have right now let's
resume in what is this this is an m5 11
brush and it's basically just a huge
blending brush so I'm gonna go in with
mix of coconut cream which is this white
shade and peanut butter from the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette and let's
just pull off this in the crease brush
just a little bit scratchy not gonna lie
I think like five minutes ago I started
telling you that we're gonna be doing an
emerald smokey eye today mostly because
if you guys saw the strobe L'Oreal
actually did like a secret strobe
giveaway too with L'Oreal stuff but they
basically sent a huge asked package a
bunch of their new products and in it
they had these eyeshadows that look
beautiful and I feel like I've never
done an emerald green eye look
so today is the day now me taking the
more m5o to brush and this Sigma palette
this is brilliant and spellbinding in
the shade sensational in here which is
not what I would title the shade this is
like literally a brown color but it
is amazing look at that Brown it is like
the ugliest but most appealing brown
shade ever so I'm just taking that
blending brush I'm putting a little bit
on here it is super powdery so it has a
little bit of fallout so you want to top
off your brush first but we're just
gonna blend this on the outer like oh
man look at that brown perfect crap
Brown this on the outer third and then
probably yeah taking whatever is left
over and just blending it in the crease
a little bit much feels a lot softer the
shade blends out really easily to which
I really like next I'm gonna take this
super tiny blending brush and 5:06 we're
gonna go back out the chocolate bar
palette and I'm gonna take don't a brown
or a liquid what is that
so let's take liquorice I'm just gonna
start blending this in the outer corner
of my eye so life what is it going on I
think this video will be up actually
like a few days after its filmed for
once usually a pre-recorded couple weeks
in advance but I'm gonna be going to San
Diego March 4th or 3rd that weekend let
me know if you guys would want to do
some kind of Meetup
I'm going there to visit family but I
think I'm also going to be getting
eyebrows tattooed which I'm super
excited about I found this lady on Yelp
whom I'm going to over photos look
amazing the brush hairs look like
supernatural I'll probably be
documenting that whole process and
making a video on it if you guys want to
see that why did I not eat breakfast
right now so thing I'm actually gonna
put down a base underneath I'm gonna use
gold because I have this thing and it
looks freaking beautiful and I feel like
green on top of gold might look really
cool so this is the julep eyeshadow 101
eyeshadow stick I've heard really good
things about these and put they're super
long-lasting I have this gold shade
right here which is warm gold shimmer so
I'm just gonna put this all over the lid
oh man
you could just use this okay well
there's a gold smokey eye if you want to
stop there and you don't even need to
blend that out like I would just
literally stop there I take the L'Oreal
shadow in 213 teal couture I've been
really liking the Coastal Scents fresh
s20 and it's just a super flat really
good brush for packing shadow on top of
your lid this is like a really
interesting formula it's kind of gel to
powder we're just gonna pull up this on
top so I'm bringing this right up to
that tan color I feel like you can
definitely see some of the gold
underneath and it looks really cool
because of this formula I'm not getting
any fodder at all which is really nice
because it's kind of like a cream that
color is super pretty I think we need a
brown shade to blend into the crease so
I'm gonna go back up the chocolate bar
call it stick hot fudge so I'm gonna
take my Coastal Scents br-2 50 brush
which has been one of my favorites
lately and we're gonna go in with hot
fudge and basically blend this straight
into the crease mostly focusing it on
the outer 1/3 okay so now that we've
spent now we're blending and go back in
with a fluffy brush and take that poop
brown shade again by Sigma and just warm
up the crease a little bit more
with a little bit more of this on the
lid because we've blended so much next
I'm gonna take an eyeliner for my
waterline this is the drool gel eye
glider this is in blackest black I've
never used this before but apparently
this is like one of their bestsellers
did you guys see that that just went on
so easily so I'm going to take this
super tiny brush by morpheus as the M
508 brush and I'm going to take
liquorice again which is a black shadow
from tooth paste and just blend this on
the outer third I'm gonna take two-faced
peanut butter on here and blend
underneath that black I've been on a Mad
Men marathon lately have you guys seen
that show if not you need to it kind of
makes me question my grandparents a lot
but it's really interesting one season
three and I started it last week no
shame I'm gonna take our favorite again
and I'm gonna go back in with that gold
oh yeah this is super pretty I feel like
that in our corner never quite picks up
on camera
I'm gonna use my Physicians Formula eye
booster like always not sure if we're
gonna do a wing or just wine
okay I think we're gonna skip the wing
today I think once we have falsies on we
won't even need it so I'm gonna put on
some s gara and put on a super thin coat
of mascara before falsies anyways life
super excited to go home for a little
bit I think it'll be really nice I've
had an interesting last couple months
okay I would never use this mascara by
itself this is pretty awful
well that is drying let's do contour my
lips our hello dry right now nobody
going with my favorite it cosmetics my
sculpted face palette I actually
returned the Kat Von D shade and light
palette it was just too dark for my skin
tone I don't know I didn't I don't quite
get that height it was almost too
powdery for me this one is just perfect
to me I love this contour palette in
this highlight which I mentioned five
thousand times is beautiful so I'm
taking the M 501 brush for a highlight
which I do really like abused this a
couple times now and this you guys will
see in my I'm probably just gonna do a
January and February waves and rejects
now because January raids and rejects
just didn't happen but I've been using
this every day for over a month now that
this white light Goldy shade right here
is perfect if you have pale skin you can
make it look like a really intense
highlight or you can just make it look
like kind of a highlighting powder if
that makes sense like just bringing
brightness to your cheekbones I'm just
gonna apply this right here just gives a
really nice glow and I just love the
shade of it on my skin tone I've also
used this these two shades as like a
contour and it totally works I'm
actually gonna let's try wetting the
brush this time so I'm gonna spray this
with some fix+
I kind of want like a really intense I
deleted a look at that glow people with
the emerald shade I feel like we need a
little bit more of a like berry tone
blush so I'm going in with this Too
Faced heart but blush in your love is
king sometimes is very light like
actually blinds me think it is a false
key time so I'm gonna take these violet
Vox lashes I got these at IMATS and I
wore these in the strobe makeup tutorial
that I did these are just laying and
they're so freakin pretty
all the top lashes are drying going to
be putting on bottom mascara this is wet
marled megali my favorite I'm just gonna
blend those falsies into my natural
lashes with this I'm gonna blend in that
lash band by putting some eyeliner over
top okay what so I'm gonna be using the
julep lip mousse and these are totally
freakin underrated these are the matte
lip mousse they're pretty new they came
out in December I think they have like
six or seven shades maybe they're gonna
take a lot which is kind of like color
pop trap or B sue thing we're going to
do Lola the formula of these is
beautiful they're long lasting the
breads are interesting I've never seen
the liquid lipstick brush like this but
it kind of curves the shape of your lips
if that makes sense I do like to use
just kind of like the ball end to get in
the line Zoila its first look at that
shade they feel moisturizing they don't
feel what they feel moisturizing but
they do dry down that you're getting the
box make sure you put one of these in it
because I don't think you'll be
disappointed alright so this is the
final look if you guys liked this video
give it a thumbs up so I know make sure
you're following me on social because

videos I usually ask you guys what you
want to see if you want to check out the
julep box I'll leave a 50% off code in
