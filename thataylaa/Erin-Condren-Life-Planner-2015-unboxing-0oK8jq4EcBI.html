is the third video I'm filming today
totally was not planning whoa why'd it
just get so bright the Sun is completely
out right now I totally wasn't planning
on filming a third video today but I
went down to check the mail and my baby
has arrived so today I'm going to be
unboxing my Erin Condren I am so excited
for this thing if I didn't film today I
don't think I have enough willpower to
not witness my colleague at work
actually introduced me to Erin Condren I
had no idea this whole planner world
existed at all and now I'm like addicted
there's a whole group of people who have
an entire Instagram or YouTube dedicated
to planner decorating and feel effects
and all this I had no idea existed
if you look up the hashtag and Condren
or feel oh addict or feel effects addict
on instagram you'll just find a ton
of people a list of my favorites down
below but lately I've been like really
into watching planner decorating videos
let me know down below what your guys's
favorite people are to watch or look at
on Instagram and YouTube for this okay
so there's this card on top that says
enjoy and it basically has I don't even
know if this is catalogue or something a
bunch of random in here let's get
to the good stuff wearing my purple
lipstick and honor of Erin Condren yes
that was planned let's do this so I got
a planner obviously and I got a few
random things as well so the cool thing
about Eric Andre and if you're not
familiar it's basically like you can
completely customize your planner and
your covers and whatever you want oh my
gosh this is so pretty okay so here's my
cover I'm not going to show you the
second name because I don't want to so
you can choose whatever cover you want
you can also buy additional covers for
like five or ten dollars I think has
completely come off you just can remove
it by pulling off a little spiral thing
so mine I had starting with the end of
2014 and then the whole year of 2015 if
you do it that way it's like five extra
dollars but I want to use it before
your first page looks like this and
there's some random inspirational quotes
and things and then it begins so looks
like you have the monthly calendar and
then also weekly calendars and I like
how they break it down by morning day
and night I like that because then I can
kind of separate my work with YouTube
and then other once you get past
the calendar pages there's a note
section I've seen a lot of people do
really cool things with the notes
section I've also seen people do like
pocket inserts and like people get
really creative I've never done this
before so I have no idea how mine's
gonna turn out it'll be fun pervy
stickers just a bunch of random things
that you can decorate your planner with
and also some tabs that you can use
here's the pocket what is this really
like how they give you like a ziploc
pouch right here there's a spot right
here where you could use either like dry
erase markers or whatever you want on
the inside back cover and then again on
the back I have the red roses you can
easily put this in your purse and take
it with you if you want to these are
pretty pricey I think I said how much is
retail for but I think they're around
fifty or fifty-five dollars and then I
have a $10 off coupon code for you guys
so if you're interested it's a good gift
for you to ask for for Christmas or the
holidays whatever you celebrate so I
also ordered a different cover in case I
wanted to switch it up this one is just
mint green black and white you can
choose the colors and pattern and
everything and I just like this in case
I get sick of the roses I can just like
pull it off and put this thing on I also
got some pens from their site I don't
even know why I spent money on this I
probably could have just bought pens and
I also got some holiday sheets if I
remember correctly let's see these are
all just like different themed papers I
just screenshot whenever I see a cool
idea and then I have a whole album on my
phone where I just look through for like
planner inspiration let me know if you
guys would be interested in seeing like
a watch me decorate my planner kind of
video getting real into this love you
guys thanks for watching and see you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
