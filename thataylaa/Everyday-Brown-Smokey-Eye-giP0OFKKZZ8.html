tutorial for you guys so if you want to
see this look then keep watching we're
gonna start off by applying a primer I'm
using Mac's painterly paint-pot
and applying that all over the lid and
brow bone then I'm taking the lorac
crock palette and applying the lightest
color all over my lid if you guys follow
me on Twitter I tweeted about this the
other day and it was on hot look for $12
next I'm taking that next lightest color
and just placing that over the other
color I applied that with the darkest
color we're going to deepen up the holy
 my mouth looks weird outer-v
and just blend that inwards and I'm just
using the elf angled brush for this and
I'm taking that same color with my
finger and placing it over the lid again
just to make it a little more vibrant
I'm also going to place it on my inner
tear duct and then bring it to the
bottom lash line just to make your eyes
look a little more open and then I'm
taking my highlight shade this is from
Physicians Formula and I'm just applying
that under the brow bone with a blending
brush and just blend out those harsh
lines with the brown for eyeliner I'm
using covergirl liquid line blast in
brown and I'm just applying it a little
bit winged but just to the top lash you
wanted to look a little more dramatic
you can also bring that down to the
bottom lash line I'm taking NYX jumbo
eye pencil in milk and applying that to
my waterline like always I do this every
single day just makes your eyes look
brighter then I applied the Wet n Wild
mega plump mascara and the L'Oreal and a
black tube it doesn't have a name and
then I'm going back in with that dark
brown color just to deepen it up and if
you're wondering what I used on my face
was the Milani baked bronzer in the
color Glo and for blush L'Oreal True
Match in innocent flesh and this is like
the perfect peach shade and then lips I
use Mac Smith um just a nudie color and
that's the finished look I hope you guys
liked it if you did thumbs up this video
and I'll see you guys later
cheesy smile</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
