right so today we have a hair tutorial
I've never done a hair video I don't
think ever maybe one time hair is not
typically my thing hair and I usually
don't get along I'm just not that into
hair I feel like people kind of assume
that if you're into makeup you're into
hair that is not the case with me but I
have been wearing this look a lot lately
and I've gotten a lot of questions on it
on Instagram and on YouTube so I figured
I would do a like tutorial or just show
you guys how I do it takes me about ten
minutes total now now that I have like a
routine down and I can wear this for
like 3 to 4 days my hair doesn't really
get oily so leave it in until I have to
wash it again get the dry shampoo going
I did just film a makeup look on this
look so I'll link it down below if you
guys want to see how I got this look
you're in the right place just keep
watching got the coffee we're ready to
go so the night before I want to wear
curly hair the next day I wash my hair
put it in a towel to dry and when it's
still damp I take it out of the towel I
run some Sally Hershberger glam waves
style shaper and this is basically a
foam product and I just basically run it
through my hair and then scrunch it up
with my hands I let that sit for about
10 minutes and then I just put my hair
in a braid and then I wake up I got my
best friend to use this and she said
this is like a miracle worker for her
hair she has naturally like straight ish
wavy hair and she does the same thing
and it works really well for her so
don't think you have to have like super
naturally curly hair to do this at all
once it's in a braid we're just gonna
take it out my hair it doesn't fully dry
overnight so sometimes when I'm doing
this it's like a little bit damp so I
just let it dry for like 15 minutes
while I'm doing my makeup or whatever
but I think we're good today and I kind
of just dries different every single
night but we have body now and we have
like a little something to work with
it's hard to see my hair on camera
because it's so dark but this is kind of
what we're working well you can see from
here down is straight from that grade
don't worry about that we're gonna be
curling that so before we apply any heat
I always apply a heat protectant this is
the CBS brand defend and it just has
thermal protection spray this actually
makes your hair
we're shiny which is nice and it smells
really good this is just my
favorite one at the moment and I like
that it has a good aerosol spray you can
just get your hair more even still
getting over my cold right now I would
be filming a shadow and schmooze after
this which is why I'm not wearing makeup
right now all right so my hands down
favorite hair product what am I saying
styling company is Bombay hair they have
the best hot tools usually just get sent
a ton of hot tools I have a whole box of
them and I've tried out I usually end up
donating them or giving them to friends
or whatever but Bombay is my favorite by
far I use their straightener every
single day I also use this curling iron
and there's a bigger one too I think
this is a 3/4 so the 1 inch
I'll leave the exact one down below I
also have a coupon code for you guys you
can use the code Taylor - and get 20%
off your whole order so if you want to
get the straightener and you want to get
the whole shebang now it's the time I
usually start from the underneath part
of my hair like closest to my neck you
can literally start from where you can
clip back your hair if it's easier for
you I don't actually curl every single
strand of hair so I just like to let it
lay how it's gonna lay and then
basically what I do is curl it away from
my face so you're gonna put it behind
your piece of hair I hope I shave my
armpits and I don't start all the way up
at the hair shaft is that what it's
called
hairs like not my thing this is just
what I've been doing lately you guys
said you wanted to see this so we're
here this curls really fast oh I
can put it on the heat oh good it's off
alright so I usually put on 450 just
because my hair is like really tough and
thick and now we're gonna chill well
that hits up my hair literally stays for
like three days styled with these things
totally worth the investment to me so
when it's ready to go it turns green
which is really nice and that took about
a minute and a half heats up super
quickly which I like for the morning I
don't use a glove when I curl my hair
but I probably should because I have
like three curling burns on my arm right
here so there you go right now I just
kind of let it hang we're gonna like
roughing it up a little bit and it's
gonna fall but right now I'm just gonna
let it chill there I basically just put
over my hair for it and see like which
piece I want
do next I usually start by curling just
the bottom sections so it looks a little
bit more normal so just where my hair is
straight right here it's gonna take that
and curl it backwards away from the face
again just holding this for I don't even
know probably like 10 seconds this one
makes your hair look really shiny it has
some kind of let's read about it
negative ions seal the cuticle for frizz
free results and it uses negative ion
technology this is look it's pretty
messy natural curls you can basically
just do whatever you want and it's going
to look okay sometimes I take big
sections on the bottom sometimes I like
take little sections as long as you're
curling away from your face that's what
we're going for so you can see the
difference just by curling the ends from
this side to this side will last a
couple inches so now I'm just going to
go through and take pieces to make it
look a little bit more done I deal with
the bangs last so I'm just clipping
those over and I usually like to just
start with a section right above my ear
the key with this look is to just not
curl every single piece Similac super
tight when you first have it done but
we're gonna like play with it afterwards
I'm never bringing the curling one above
my ear with these curls for me that just
doesn't work it makes my hair look like
I am a lion
if you have a piece like this that you
curled a little bit too far up what I
like to do is just take the curling iron
and kind of basically straighten it on
the other side and just kind of redo the
curl there you go so here's what the two
sides are looking like in comparison
this took me literally about four
minutes to do when I do my whole head it
takes me ten minutes in the morning and
that's faster than straightening it's
faster than doing anything else that I
usually do to my hair this is my bangs
though that aways I like to deal with
them before I do the other side usually
so I'm just gonna kind of let it fall
where it usually parts itself today they
set good I like when it sets with the
little volume here because I cannot
tease my hair it's way too thick it
doesn't hold a tease
so when it naturally sets with some
volume it's gonna be a good day ladies
I'm gonna leave that little portion for
now and pin it back and we're just gonna
go in and curl this front section so
it's my bangs I basically do the same
thing where I kind of straighten it
first so I take the underneath side and
just run it down and this just helps to
like get any of the frizz ease out and
then what I like to do to give it some
volume is actually press the wand the
opposite direction and just kind of hold
it there for a second so it creates this
little kind of bump right there again if
you have thin hair you can just tease
your hair you don't have to do this and
see how it just gives some volume right
there curl the ends away from the face
again I'm basically just gonna be
curling the ends because I like the way
the rest of it looks alright so once the
banks are curled back I kind of just
like play with them and get them to stay
away from my face when you first try and
curl away from your face it just gets
kind of confusing once you get the hang
of the direction you can do it superfast
so again on the top I'm just running
that curling iron underneath in the
opposite direction so I pretty much have
the back from just pulling it in front
and curling it but I just like to throw
it back and then basically just kind of
play with the top and grab a couple
pieces to curl
the top so then I just kind of run my
hands through it loosen it up a little
bit
tape the bangs how I want them to be
twist them back into the curl hairspray
I love is Dove style and care this is a
flexible hold hairspray so it doesn't
feel crunching your hair at all Spray
kind of smooth it out as I go
curls are gonna fall out a little bit
throughout the day so they're not gonna
look this tight the whole day all right
so I just filmed a shadow much mousse on
the look I'm wearing right now it'll be
up it's already up when you're watching
this I'll link that down below or if
you're on mobile you can click the
little eye and watch that video here's
what my situation is looking like once I
have everything on it looks natural but

it I get the most compliments on my hair
