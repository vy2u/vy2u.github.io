this has been super highly requested so
I hope it lives up to all of your
expectations I'm gonna start out by
combing out my brows you can use any
kind of brows bully for this this just
makes them easier to see and see where
you want to pencil in so for the brush I
like to use a brush by NYX Cosmetics and
it's VP 18 I bra brush actual only use
one product when I fill in my brows and
that is the Mac fluidline in the shade
passed by light and this is a gel liner
you can use any of Mac's fluid line
projects or Paint Pots for your brows
depending on your shade so I just like
to start by naturally kind of following
that shape of my eyebrow and it's all
about pressure because we want more of a
faded effect the front part of our brows
were barely gonna apply any pressure - I
like the outer half of my brow to be at
the darkest so that's where we're going
to apply the most product and this is me
showing you this is where your brow
technically should end so if you make a
diagonal line out from your outer corner
of your eye this is where your eyebrow
should end and then you want your arrow
to begin straight up from your inner
corner so filling in your brows is kind
of all about practice in finding the
right shape and kind of arch that works
for your face shape so this is just how
I filled them in I always start at the
bottom and then I'll go to the top of
the brow and then fill it in last if
your arch gets a little intense like it
just did there don't worry we're going
to clean it up with concealer this is a
good trick if you mess up or put on too
much your brow gets a little crazy we've
got stuff to fix that so now I'm just
filling it in completely again you
really like here I'm barely touching my
eyebrow we just kind of want to fade it
into that deeper brown color the biggest
tip I can give for not looking like you
just sharp it in your brows is leave the
front part of your brows alone or like I
do turn the brush and just lightly
feather that
if there isn't enough hair naturally
there at the front of the brow you can
always use a super light shade like
naked or buck from The Naked palette if
you do that turn your brush upwards and
make sure you're stroking in the natural
direction of your hair now I'm going to
go back in with the spoolie and just
comb through my brows because I do use a
full coverage foundation I'll usually go
in with whatever foundation I use that
day carving out your brows with
foundation or concealer is a really easy
step that makes it look a lot more clean
and precise and it'll also help to fix
any of the mistakes that you make
to make the concealer or foundation
better blend into my face I just turned
the brow and blend that in like this so
this is just how I do my brows on a
pretty much everyday basis if it's
difficult for you you really just have
to practice a good trick is before you
shower at night put on some brows girl
just do it if you like this three-minute
brow routine be sure to give it a thumbs
up so I know and click the little box up
here if you want to see this tutorial
this is what I did the same days I feel
my brow routine so the brows you're
seeing are the ones I just recorded by E</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
