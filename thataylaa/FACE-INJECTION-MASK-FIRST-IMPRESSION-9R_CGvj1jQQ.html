the night but I had an urge to put this
thing on my face so we are doing this
right now this is the yuzu base
injection mask illumination now this
comes in I believe three different types
they have a hydro left illumination and
a nutrient mask not gonna lie when I
first saw this I thought it was kind of
gimmicky but once I actually started
doing research into this brand this is
actually a super interesting they're
kind of leading in the skincare science
department if you will the way that this
works is this is a sheet mask but it's a
little bit different than a typical
sheet mask they have this section right
here which contains a little thing to
inject what does that call it syringe
there we go and it basically has
concentrated ingredients in it kind of
like a concentrated serum that you
actually inject into this guy and this
is a sheet mask in here so instead of
having a sheet mask that has been
sitting in the ingredients for months or
years until you open it this one
literally has the fresh ingredients that
haven't been exposed or mixed yet so you
really get a super fresh face mask so I
think that's kind of interesting so
we're gonna try it today I am a face
mask hoarder I still need to do a face
mask collection but I have done a first
impression video on another face mask
the 24 karat gold one so I will link
that down below if you missed that face
masks are my jam I'm all about them let
me know your favorite face masks down
below I have a bowl here because I have
a feeling this is gonna get messy
obviously have Foundation and stuff on
right now so we are going to take this
off and then I'm gonna wash my face if
you're new to my channel I do have
combination skin with cystic acne my
skin is pretty sensitive to certain and
foundations and mass and skin care
products so we'll see how it reacts to
this I was not planning on filming right
now but I sat down to watch goth girl
and I was like you know what I feel like
filming right now alright so now that my
makeups off I'm gonna go wash my face
because I typically like to do that
before applying a face master so it's
not like putting any of that deeper into
my skin so I'm gonna go do that and I'll
be right back
faces washed let's do this I'm excited
just kind of feel
like a science project so we're just
gonna disconnect our little syringe here
it is sealed and I believe you have to
kind of like break the little stopper
thing somehow by the way you can get
this mask off of me me box for five
bucks I'll leave a link down below okay
so I think I'm supposed to start by
pushing down on here to like release
something oh there we go okay so it just
shot out something like goop I don't
know if you guys will be able to see
that but there's a little white thing
right there it just like shot that out
so it says now you're supposed to shake
it oh this is fun okay it's getting like
pretty milky so I think we're all shaken
up it looks pretty milky now this is the
packet I'm putting it into so there's a
little cap right here that we're gonna
open there we go nails feel like this is
gonna be so satisfying going to take the
cap off running out and I'm gonna put
this thing in here let's syringe this
bad boy is something I really feel like
I'm doing one of those kit things did
you ever do those when you're growing up
there's like overpriced kids to
entertain kids for like five hours press
that down and we're just gonna mix this
around basically to cover the entire
sheet mask with the board on this is
cool this is also very therapeutic
so I think we're all mixed up let's go
for this smells kind of like a rose or
something just super wet so is this one
of those masks that has kind of a gauze
that you take off after you put it on
it's just supposed to make it easier to
apply so it's not like bending on itself
which I like sometimes she masks are
really hard to apply so anyone else feel
like they can't breathe sometimes when
they put you masks on
like I kind of feel like I'm scuba
diving well okay a major drip edge we
have a ton of liquid coming out so much
locally I'm gonna take this guy's off
it's just
maybe not oh here we go
hmm this is super what like I need a
towel right now think I'm eating half of
this get that nose good so I'm gonna
leave this on for 15 to 20 minutes and I
will be back to check in just try and
take a thumbnail over here okay so this
haven't now been on for 20 minutes did a
few snapchat filters livin it up so
let's take this off oh that sounds good
so the actual mass feels very cooling
when it's on your face it is pretty
relaxing like it genuinely feel pretty
relaxed right now super wet I'm gonna
try and like rub some of this in my face
I can't tell if you're supposed to wash
this off or not but generally speaking
with sheet masks you kind of just want
to like rub it into your skin and let it
sit there it does still feel really nice
and cooling it almost feels like when
you put like an aloe gel moisturizer on
that's how my face is feeling I honestly
don't feel like right after masses when
I see the biggest difference is usually
in the morning but I really like the way
this one feels especially for a sheet
mask I just want to like keep rubbing my
face cuz it feels so good and like
almost feels kind of plump really
repurchase it and use it again I think
it felt very relaxing and I usually
don't like sheet masks so a lot just
because I feel like it can't move around
and live my life while they're on but if
you are just like chillin i just sat and
watched youtube videos on my phone for
20 minutes so if you just want to like
sit there and not move and have stuff to
do shoot masks are nice and relaxing so
it's been about 5 minutes since I filmed
that last clip and it definitely feels
like it's starting to actually absorb
into my skin and it does look very nice
and moisturized and illuminating and
plump so if you guys liked this video
