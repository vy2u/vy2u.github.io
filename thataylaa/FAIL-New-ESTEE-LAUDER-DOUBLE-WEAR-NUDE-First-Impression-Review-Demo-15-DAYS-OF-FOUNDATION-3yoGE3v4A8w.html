literally can't focus on what I'm saying
all right so today it's day 11 of 15
days of foundation days one through ten
are linked down below in a playlist if
you missed any today is an interesting
day so today's video started out as a
review on the Lottie London all about
that base full coverage matte foundation
stick I'm gonna give you the quick
rundown on this thing and what ended up
happening and then we'll go into today's
actual video which turned into this so
Lottie London is a new drugstore brand
that's carried out alta this retails for
$8.99 and get 0.31 ounces of product in
here this comes in ten shades I've
lightest shade ivory supposed to be a
full coverage matte foundation stick
effortlessly blends out seamless
undetectable full coverage finish I
asked you guys on snapchat what I should
do about this as I was in the midst of
filming because I put this on my face
you guys will see I'm gonna start the
footage it looked freakin horrendous one
of the worst foundations I've ever put
on my face to the point where I would
never put this on again I wouldn't
recommend that you guys try it out I
think it's a pretty all over horrible
foundation so I ended up scrapping this
thing but I wanted to still include it
in this video to show you guys what I
think of it and to show you the
application so you guys will see me
putting this on my thoughts on this and
then I'm gonna go into the second
foundation which I ended up wearing
today which is the sa lauder double wear
nude water fresh makeup this is new by
Estee Lauder so this is the replacement
foundation for today
so the Estee Lauder Double Wear original
foundation is kind of like their hero
double wear product they've come out
with a few different foundations under
this line this one retails for $42.99
kin Follis 24 hours staying power water
light it actually says 12 hours staying
powered on the box just a few hours
difference there that says this fluid
long wear makeup feels like you have
nothing on moves comfortably with your
skin looks fresh natural healthy even
toned with SPF 30 and antioxidants it's
your invisible defence or mole bla
constantly hydrates but it does say that
it's oil controlling so even though it's
hydrating one of their claims is that it
is oil controlling I have combination
skin I get oily throughout the day I'm
gonna serve swatches here Double Wear
nude and one see one compared to
the other double war products I have and
also some other foundations just so you
can see how the shade compares alright
we are gonna do some swatches so right
here's estee lauder double wear nude
foundation in 1c one cool bone next to
it right here is the original double
wear formula and the exact same shade 1c
one cool bone as you can see there's
quite a difference between these two one
c1 shades and then this is the one c0
shade in the original double wear which
you can only get on eBay if you're in
the u.s. so next over is the milk makeup
blur liquid and the lightest shade fair
Urban Decay Naked Skin Foundation and
0.5 derma Club to 0-8 and pure cosmetics
bare at all in porcelain if you've been
enjoying 15 days of foundation so far
don't forget to give this video a thumbs
up we only have 4 more days woah so if
you want to see how it went with good
old Lottie London stick foundation and
then also the Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation nude and how it applies
somewheres throughout the day you're in
the right place just keep watching all
right guys it is 10:45 I woke up at 7
o'clock to start filming today day 11
man feels like day 11 I'm having one of
those days where it's just hard to get
going hard to start filming no broth
sleep shirt I just got a triple shot and
I feel like I literally took nyquil but
we are putting foundation on my face
today another stick foundation for most
stick foundations like Tuesday Sigma f80
- I might try the sponge on the other
side just to see my eyebrows are
horrendous right now I'm trying to grow
them out so I can wax them right before
the trip already wash moisturize primed
my face let's go in on this side first
feels a little bit stiff to blend out
that is not full coverage yes I put a
decent amount of product on there it's
almost like blending away okay I Jim did
the ring light a little bit so hopefully
you can see this this is bizarre when
you blend it out that is not looking
good on my dryness up here who else bad
before I do this side I'm gonna try and
build this up and just see what it looks
like at this point this is not something
that I even want to wear throughout the
day I'm gonna add some more and see if
this is buildable what the heck do you
guys see this it's like when you blend
it out it wipes away everything and I'm
not like blending or wiping I'm just
trying to stipple this in not only is
this not covering anything on the second
layer it just is sitting on my skin very
bizarre man I don't think I've had a
foundation look this shitty in a while
mm-hmm okay let's try a damp sponge on
the other side just to see maybe this
just needs some moisture put into it so
we'll see if this sponge is better so
the finish looks slightly better with
this sponge but it's pretty much not
covering anything okay let's try and
build it up do a second layer with a
sponge the finish of this and the way
it's sitting on my skin just looks
horrible like coverage aside just the
finish of it
emphasizing everything looks very dry I
wouldn't go outside in this if someone
paid me is this one worth even wearing
throughout the day because off the bat I
would never recommend this to you guys I
would never put this on my face again
this might be one of the worst
foundations I've ever tried I'm gonna go
on snapchat and see what you guys think
I should do if I should just take this
off film the intro and wrap this one up
or if I should attempt to wear it
throughout the day because I don't
really know what to do right now alright
so I asked you guys on the snapchats now
Pam has spoken what we're gonna do is
totally scrap this one because there's
no point why do you exist I don't know
so what we're gonna do instead so that
this isn't just a super short video and
kind of like a cop-out is test out a
different foundation today so I'm gonna
do the estee lauder double wear nude
water fresh makeup attempt number two
we're now starting this at 11:15 so I
wiped that off my face wash my face
moisturize primed again Sony's my ELF
ultimate blending brush on one side of
my face and then the dampened sponge why
is my eyeball still twitching I'm gonna
shake whoo it sounds very watery let's
get some of this out this is like water
so in one of the other 15 dates of
foundation series I don't can't remember
if it was the last one or the one before
that but I tested out the Estee Lauder
Double Wear the Double Wear foundation
does not work for me at all it looks so
heavy so cakey on my skin does not give
me full coverage I know it looks amazing
on some people it's just one of those
products up for whatever reason on my
skin doesn't work so this one says real
skin finish supposed to be more like
lightweight move with your skin moisture
complex so I like that I like those
claims so I'm just gonna go in with the
brush first on this side of my face I
don't think this is gonna be super hike
coverage ooh
this shade is nice the shade is
definitely different than the one c1 in
the double wear oh I really like the
shade of this all right now it's looking
like medium coverage you can still see
my acne and stuff coming through I'm not
expecting this one to be full coverage
sitting on this skin really nice looks
really pretty I'm just kind of like
moisturizing and luminous true test is
always how it foundation looks on my
forehead especially right in the center
and this one looks really pretty it's
not clinging to anything up here like
Lahti and right on the center it looks
pretty good looks moisturized try the
other side with the sponge I'm curious
how this is gonna go since this is so
liquidy hoping this bunch doesn't just
absorb all this up maybe a little bit
lighter coverage than the brush side but
not by much I like the finish on both
the sponge might look a little bit
smoother do you want to see if I can
build this one up since unknown
right now it's not quite enough coverage
for me I feel like I'm using a lot of
product especially because this is so
liquidy and it's like running down the
side here and use a sponge to see if
this builds the way that this is sitting
on my skin right now I like five billion
times better than the original double
where it really does look very natural
skin like I'm gonna try the brush on the
other side actually to see if it builds
better with the brush okay I am getting
better coverage with the brush I can
tell off the bat I definitely would need
to set my face with this one just
because of how luminous and moisturizing
it is right now since I have oily skin
yeah I'm gonna need to set my face ooh
that looks good on my forehead looks
super smooth and almost like plumping
which I love I think we're at solid
medium coverage with those kind of two
layers
it doesn't look cakey at all it looks
very thin still feels pretty lightweight
too but since it didn't add a whole lot
more coverage on the second layer I
think next time what I would do is put
on just one layer of this and then spot
conceal just to cover up my acne and
stuff I'm gonna powder my face with this
one I'm thinking I want to use my laura
geller balance and brighten just because
I I love the luminosity of this but I
need to set my face yeah this definitely
feels like one of those foundations that
you need to set it feels very sticky
tacky right now it is 11:23 it's
probably time to change out of my sleep
shirt do I have to I'll be right back
okay I did it I'm really human being
changed out of my pajamas it's now
almost 12 o'clock we're gonna call the
check-in time eleven thirty since that's
when I finished up with my face so I did
set my face like I said with the Laura
Geller balance in Brighton powder and it
looks great I was kind of hesitant to
put this on my forehead because I love
the way my forehead looks it looked
super nice and moisturized and just
plump and healthy when I put the powder
on it did take that away a little bit
but it still looks really nice and glowy
you can see the glow still kind of
coming through from underneath the
finish just looks beautiful I could
almost see this being one of those
foundations that I wear when I'm not
wearing any other makeup just to kind of
even out my skin tone a bit or if you
just don't have a lot to cover up and
you like more light to medium coverage
right now it's looking for can beautiful
I also love the shade of it the shade of
this is definitely different you guys
will have already seen swatches but one
see one and the double wear does not
look like
this one to me looks a bit more pink
tone I think the shade is really
flattering so we'll see how this holds
up but it says it's supposed to last 12
hours right yeah 12 hour wear so on the
rest of my face I use la colors I love
makeup contour palette I went in with
that shade I also use this on my eyes
slush I really like this I try it out
this blush again this is a by H&amp;amp;M I have
an older video testing out H&amp;amp;M makeup
but this isn't a shade to cantaloupe and
this is a really pretty like natural
peachy pink kind of color this highlight
I tried out for the first time I've
heard so much about these this is the
artist Couture what shade is this
diamond glow powder in Illuminati and I
thought this was gonna be too gold on my
skintone but as a face highlight it is
beautiful you just kinda have to tap off
the brush and get rid of some of the
glitter and then I wet my brush and went
in with this as eyeshadow so that's like
the gold shadow this on my lid right now
which is obviously very pretty I think
my eyeshadow looks wonky I can never
tell on like the viewfinder and in the
mirror until I'm editing back this
footage because of the lashes it's
really freaking hard to do eyeshadow
with largest engines and then for lips I
use the makeup forever liquid lipstick
in 107 and I topped it off with
colour-pop ultra satin lip in little
stitches so we'll see you guys in a few
hours
alright this is a new angle but I feel
like right now this has the best
lighting it's 3:30 in the afternoon my
phone is plugged in because it's like
about today so foundations been on for
four hours and I think it's looking
really nice everywhere except right
around my nose it seems to be kind of
settling in right there but my forehead
looks really nice it just looks very
fresh and like glowy to me and it feels
lightweight so clearly I'm pretty due
right now I don't feel like I look too
oily like I like this amount of do but
as you can see around my nose right here
it's not looking too hot
ignore my eyebrows but I think my
forehead looks pretty good it's still
settling a little bit into my line right
there but the center of my forehead
looks nice very glowy so if you don't
like do be our glowy you wouldn't like
this I personally like that I feel like
it hides my texture a bit more so I'll
see you guys at the end of the night I'm
gonna try and keep this on from my usual
10 hours see in a few okay so it's now
10 to
I've been laying down and that was like
about to fall asleep my alarm went off
so it's actually a lot less oily than I
was anticipating just to get some how do
we I've been all day so I'm pleasantly
surprised this Lake does like bounce
back a little bit so that's shine you're
seeing like gonna go like that it's been
on for almost 11 hours and I see that my
forehead looks pretty good I'm getting a
little bit of separation right there but
I've definitely seen worse the rest of
my face press my face looks pretty good
it looks like it has rubbed off a little
bit right here where I was kind of
resting my head it looks like it's
oxidized a tiny bit this one has worn a
lot better than I was anticipating love
how moisturizing and just glowy and
beautiful what makes your skin look if
you have more dry skin and you like
medium coverage you probably love this
once my acne issues get solved after
accutane I can see myself using
something light coverage like this
because it does look really pretty on
the skin so started off on a bad note
with Lodi wine Nathan attempting to fix
my hair right now but this one
pleasantly surprised me so I'm excited
to mix us in try it different ways and
see what I think out so just want to try
it with like a spot concealer one layer
on the spot concealer but I hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you did make
sure to give it a thumbs up I'm so tired
right now like I'm fall asleep right now
love you guys thanks for watching see
you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
