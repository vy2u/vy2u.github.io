all right I'm feeling festive I did some
shopping I am ready for fall when you
guys are seeing this I'm gonna be in
London I went shopping initially to try
and find some outfits for London that's
what a lot of this is for and then the
other stuff is just it happened so let's
get into it I tried on everything for
you guys you can just see how it
actually looks on and everything and I
shopped on forever 21 boohoo
which I've never actually shopped on
before I paid for all this myself but I
saw some lookbook of like petite
clothing and boo who was one of the
brand's I wanted to give their petite
line a try so I got a bunch of jackets
and stuff from them and then just a few
random clothing things from Target and
some other places so let's get started
if you saw my last haul I'll put it in
the eye over here I mentioned these
pants that I got at Macy's in black and
they fit perfectly there the comfiest
things on planet earth I can't remember
how much these originally where I think
I mentioned it in that video but I got
these on sale for like 20 bucks this
time I love the color of these I don't
feel like they're quite as flattering as
the black I feel like the black just
like hides your stomach and everything a
little bit better I think they're so
cute and comfortable and I'm still gonna
wear them so forever 21 I got a few
different tops this first one was five
dollars and 80 cents it's what I tried
on those army green pants with and this
is just like an off-the-shoulder cute
kind of scrunchie crop top thing it's
not super short like you could wear this
probably with jeans or something if
you're short I just love how this sits
on my chest in my arms and you can also
wear it kind of straps up here and it
still excuse you could wear it like a
shoulder or whatever this is I also
thought for filming this would be nice
since it's like an off-the-shoulder it
would look cute with chokers and
different necklaces and things next I
got this black and white striped blouse
I guess you could call it from forever
21
this was 1490 I feel like it's a little
bit big but once I put on black jeans
which I'll show you guys that I also got
it once I talked it into the jeans I
feel like it looks cute I think would
look really cute with like a leather
jacket over that outfit but I like this
one it's a little bit too long if I just
leave it tucked out it looks a little
bit too big on me oh where did I put
those jeans
I somehow put these on my kitchen table
I still have a few things from forever21
to show you guys but since I'm trying
them all on with these pair of jeans
I'll show you this for
so these are from Free People I never go
into Free People I rarely find things I
like in Free People I found a few things
that I like from them but I usually get
them like way markdown on clearance for
Macy's cuz Macy's has a ton of sale Free
People stuff but I went in there with my
friend the other day and we went into a
store so I could actually try on pants
there for the first time and end up
finding this super cute pair of black
jeans love the button-up right here I
feel like they'll look really cute
tucking a shirt into it so you can see
that and I think they just fit really
cute they're super soft and comfy by the
way I'm a size 27 in three people they
run super super small I'm usually like a
24 or 25 so if you're gonna be ordering
these online just keep that in mind you
might want to go up a couple sizes and
these were 78 dollars back to the
forever 21 stuff I got this sweater I'm
not sure how I feel about this I think
it's a little bit too long for me and I
was wearing heels when I tried these on
so I feel like if it looks too long even
though the heels on I don't know let me
know what you guys think of the length
is nineteen ninety that's not cheap like
I might just return this one do you like
the color of it and I think this would
look really cute with black jeans and
like a white scarf or something in the
winter maybe this would even look cute
with like a black dress underneath one
of those like sweater dress situations
like knee-high boots or something okay I
don't know if it's just me but I feel
like certain pieces at forever 21 feel
like there's so much better quality than
other ones even though they're the same
price for like cheaper this is one of
those shirts that feels like it's a
really nice quality like I feel like
this is something you find out like
Banana Republic or something it just
fits really cute it obviously needs to
be ironed all this stuff does they're
steamed I'm a big fan of the steamer it
was 1990 and it just fits my arms really
cute I feel like I think it's flattering
I think it would look really cute with a
gold necklace I might wear this with
like leather leggings a material this is
nice and stretchy it's comfortable and
it also has the little sticky thing
right here on the sleeves so they're not
gonna keep like falling down your arms
all night which is nice so moving on to
boohoo like I said they have a whole
petite range of clothes I'm 411 so if I
can find like petite pants or jackets or
whatever those usually fit me better
because they're just a little bit
shorter this is probably my favorite
thing the color looks totally different
in real life than it did online it looks
like it was gonna be like a deep
burgundy kind of
this is a super-cute jacket it fits me
great it doesn't feel like high quality
oh by the way
boohoo when I was on there was half off
everything can't remember what kind of
sale they were having but I got all this
half off which is insane so I ended up
getting this jacket this one was 20
bucks you know it's not thick suede or
anything it's definitely more light but
I think that can be nice for fall
because you're nothing like sweating it
just doesn't feel like top quality so if
that's what you're expecting don't butt
for size reference I got the size 6
petite and this fits me perfectly
I would definitely order more jackets
like this from them because it's really
difficult for me to find jackets that
fit me in the shoulders and in the
sleeves I got two of the same style
because I think these were only $15 oh
by the way it's UK size 6 so that's us
too I got two of the same style so I got
a black sweater wrap thing and then also
a tan one I think I like these again I
think they're a bit too long I think I'd
have to take off a couple inches when I
was trying these on I had on like a
white tank top underneath I was also
flowy and once I talked that in you guys
will see I feel like they do look a lot
better I feel like I have a little bit
more shape the material is kind of like
that it's like a little bit cringy you
know what I mean it's not like the super
static fabric but it just has that feel
to it you know where you just want to
like then I got another black jacket
sweater thing from there this one is
more like a long blazer and I really
like the look of these when I've seen
them like styled I think the arms are a
little bit weird it's like a
three-quarter sleeve they're a little
bit baggy in the arm like I think I'd be
cuter if they made it just tie it down
the arm but I think this one looks cute
I think I would wear this again petite
size 6 and this one was $20 this I got
for only 5 bucks and I freaking love
this necklace whoops it just got all
tangled
this isn't like sterling silver or
anything so this will definitely change
colors but I figured if I can get a few
uses out of it
that's ok here we go we're making
progress this is what the necklace looks
like how freaking cute is this it's like
a layered choker situation I just feel
like this will look really cute with
like a leather jacket and white tank top
or something I think I'm gonna bring
this to London because I really like
this before it starts turning colors on
me I
I don't know if I was just having a
spaced out moment when I ordered these
or what but I swear it said size 3 these
are like a size 6 these are too big for
me but they're super cute and I think I
want to get used to my mom and just keep
them I don't know if it's worth sending
us back because these were only 15 bucks
they're super cute for only 15 bucks I
mean they look like adidas or something
the last thing I got from boohoo is this
little drawstring thing you can like
pull it in right here I think yeah you
get the idea so you can do that as far
as just like looking at the leather and
stuff it looks nice like it doesn't look
super cheap or anything to me
smells like salmon whoa gonna need a
perfume this thing this was only 14
bucks all right we only have a few
things left from Target first thing I
got at Target is this flannel which I am
in love with I love this like puke
colored Brown I'm all about it mustard
whatever you want to call this I love my
flannels clearly this is like all I wear
in the winter and fall plaid shirt or
flannel paired with the leather jacket
and jeans is like my go-to outfit I love
the colors in here I get the size small
and this is our boyfriend fit this was
$19.99 at Target is not cheap anymore I
don't get it what happened I feel like
we blinked and everything was like 10
dollars more expensive I got so many
snaps from you guys of this shirt that I
had to go get it go walk this way and it
has avocado x' but the cutest thing is
that the avocados have little hearts as
the pit so I'll probably just wear this
with like sweats or yoga pants or
whatever if I'm going to run errands but
I couldn't not get this this isn't a
size small and it was $12.99 the last
thing I got from Target I was totally
shocked when I saw these look at these
shoes do these not look like adidas or
Nike like to the teeth so these around
the kids section they're the size three
and they were $24.99 25 bucks gotta love
the kids section if you're a size 6 you
can actually wear kid size for size
threes are usually like asides 4 or 5
sometimes I'm a two and a half I think
my flip-flops from Target the kids
section wear size two and a half oh
they're right here two to three I
probably won't wear these for working
out which I actually have been doing
I've been doing Jillian Michaels like
every day I don't think I would wear
these for working out working out but I
think this looks super cute just with
leggings for running errand
and wearing around town you know what
I'm saying that is everything I picked
up I'm actually filming day 14 today 15
days of foundation the two-faced peach
perfect so if you want to know the make
up on the rest of my face it's exactly
what was in that video I just added a
little bit more gold to like warm up the
look and then I changed my lip color on
my lips right now so I don't forget and
I could put it in the description box is
pur cosmetics addicted liquid lipstick
with a little bit of the always on bang
bang by Smashbox on top but if you want
to check anything out that I showed
everything is linked down below in the
