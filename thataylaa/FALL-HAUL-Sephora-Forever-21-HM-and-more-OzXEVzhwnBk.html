or a beer stress ball maybe some yoga
who knows can't believe that just came
out of my mouth yoga all right we are
filming another fall haul because this
month has been mmm just a little
stressful retail therapy has been
next-level some major changes happening
at work and just a bunch of stuff going
on yeah I just spent too much money
that's the moral the story I'll leave my
last fall haul down below or you can
click the I on the screen I think it's
over here I don't know you can click the
I on the screen if you're on mobile and
that will open up that video for you but
yeah that was just a couple weeks ago so
we're back so I have some makeup stuff
and clothes stuff in here so I think
we're gonna start with forever 21 I
placed an online order forever 21 if you
guys have seen any of my other hauls
before you know that I absolutely dread
shopping at forever 21 I think it is the
most not relaxing shopping experience
you could possibly have and so the only
time I buy stuff from there is if it's
online so the first thing I got is this
colored jacket I love these kind of
slouchy jackets and it has this like
nylon front which kind of looks like a
rain jacket but then the back is just
cotton I just think this will look
really cute with jeans or leggings or
whatever I think this just like 22 yeah
22 90 and I got the size small if you're
wondering ended up picking up just a
black scarf this is an infinity scarf
and it's not the softest thing in the
world I'm thinking about returning this
it's like a little on the itchy side I
feel like when scarves are like that I
just don't wear them so I might return
this that this was 1090 from forever 21
and I don't actually own a not huge
black infinity scarf you know what I
mean like the ones that you could
actually keep on indoors by the way my
apartment is like Antarctica right now
which is why I'm dressed like this I
don't actually know how to turn on her
heat in this new building so that'll be
fun
I should probably figure that out what
else I got two pairs of over the knee
socks actually got three but the black
ones I've already worn and these were
each six ninety I got a burgundy one and
then this like marbled black and white
one and these just look super cute to
wear over leggings or tights with
over-the-knee boots which I got and I'll
show you next I picked up a pair of
knee-high over-the-knee boots and these
are from Nordstrom's these were that's
cheap but I've been kind of in this like
splurging on shoes mood which I've never
never been in before in my life
basically I discovered the brand Franco
Sarto Franco Sardo no idea how to say
his name they put his shoes on hot look
Ally I didn't get these on hot luck but
I really like his brand I have two other
pairs of issues if you have petite size
shoes aka like a midget size shoe I'm a
size four and his size fours fit me
perfectly I just love these I like that
they're flat because I feel like I'll
actually wear them kind of tempted to
get me high-heeled boots but I just feel
like I'll wear those like once a year
the thing I really liked about these is
that they have a zipper down the side a
lot of over the knee boots don't do that
so there's literally no way to get them
on and off unless you want to spend like
a half-hour putting on your boots which
I do not we run these with tights and
then the over-the-knee black socks and
they look really cute I'll leave a link
everything that I can find down below
okay weren't you something so then I
went to H&amp;amp;M and I got a few things that
you know the first thing is this top
which some people are gonna think is
absolutely hideous but I personally love
and it's just one of those tops that if
you're feeling it you got to go for it I
just think this will look really cute
with like a statement necklace and some
dark black jeans this is like a top that
I would wear to work and I love the gold
and black zipper in the back
$24.99 from hmm super nice silky
material oh no I'm just kind of feeling
this next to got another shirt for work
slash it just reminds me of the holidays
this color this is an emerald green and
Kuwaitis note that I've gotten to things
of color this is like rare I don't
really know what's wrong with me that
day but I got two shirts in not black
this is an emerald green silky kind of
v-neck top and I like it how it has a
little cap sleeves
this was $17.99 which is really
reasonable I should have got this in a
couple other colors I feel like just a
low enough v-neck that I can wear it to
work but it's not like inappropriate and
I could also wear it going out to dinner
or something with like a necklace like
that also got this gray Heather good
skirt is just one of those high-waisted
skirts that is actually tight around the
legs that's my pet peeve with these
skirts is when is not tight around your
knees if there's that little awkward gap
you know I'm talking about this one is
actually really tight against your whole
body this was really cheap I think yeah
this was $12.99 and I got the size extra
small just because I wanted it super
tight this army green wow I got so much
color army green laser looks like that
it's like one of the super super slouchy
and baggy in the front and it has this
gold zipper on the side which I thought
was really cute fits really cute hmmm
Blazers always fit great this was $24.99
which is really reasonable probably just
wear it with like a black or white tank
top underneath okay I went a little
crazy on the knee-high socks apparently
I got another great one and these ones
are super soft from H&amp;amp;M these were $9.99
apparently I got two more black ones I
think I forgot I bought these when I
ordered them on forever 21 now I have
enough knee-high socks for the rest of
my life to pack for $9.99 steel also got
some tights from H&amp;amp;M which I've already
upside down already worn one of these
that this comes with two pairs and they
feel really nice they're like the tummy
talking kind of ones I don't think
they're actually supposed to be like
that but they actually help suck
everything in if you know what I'm
saying
and these were 595 for two pairs which
is really good there's like 30 different
kinds of tights at H&amp;amp;M so make sure you
look the most sheer ones if that's what
you're going for these tights with the
over the knee socks look super cute and
it still looks like you can kind of see
your skin through all right so then I
placed a few online orders of beauty
stuff in my what video was that in my
Too Faced Born This Way Foundation
review a link down below I asked you
guys which foundation you want to see a
first impression on next a lot of people
said the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation stick this is a new product
from Make Up For Ever I got the shade
115 and I haven't watched it or anything
but just looking at it in the tube it
looks a little bit dark I think this is
yeah this looks pretty dark but we'll
see so I will be doing a first
impression video on this since you guys
want to see it make sure you leave your
suggestions whether it's like makeup
tutorials or first impression videos or
reviews make sure you leave them in the
comments down below because I do sit
down
every night and read my comments and
respond to you guys and I do take your
suggestions to heart so if there's
something you want to see I'll see the
comment and purchase it next I got the
Kat Von D shade + light eye palette and
this is like a totally impulsive
decision I just felt like spending money
and I thought what product have I heard
a lot of good things about that won't
let me down this is it so I'm sure you
guys have all seen this bad boy by now
super excited to try it out the
packaging is very heavy it feels like a
brick and look at these matte shadows
you just look beautiful
haven't swatch any of these yet because
I think I'm gonna do my first impression
or a tutorial using this so I kind of
want to just be surprised looks really
pretty there's some nice cool tones in
here and then some warmer ones over here
I'm all about that orange brown shade
right there alright get in there I got a
sample of Viktor &amp;amp; Rolf Rolf Rolf spiced
bomb perfume I don't think I've smelled
this before but this is like a deluxe
sample size is this a guy's club major
cinnamon hmm not sure how I feel about
that then I got the Mac painterly
paint-pot weirded this off with
Nordstrom that's usually where I get my
Mac stuff because they have free
shipping no minimum and this is soft
ochre I think I've mentioned it in a
couple videos now but my painterly
paint-pot is like completely dried up if
you're gonna have a try out soft ochre
which is a little bit lighter and yellow
toned so if you have lighter skin this
might work better for you I don't know I
haven't tried it yes then I picked up
the Ophir Cosmetics highlighter and this
is you glow girl
so dupe that the Instagram account who
does like makeup dupes watches they
collaborated with Oprah for two
different highlighters you glow girl I
forget what the other one was called but
it's like a Goldie Irwin this one looks
beautiful i swatched this on my hand and
it is like this oh my god do you see
that oh yeah it is a pink highlight it
looks freaking beautiful got it for like
$14 with kathleenlights code and then I
also picked up their makeup fixer makeup
setting spray I'm curious to see how
this is gonna spray out at the top and
this is how it came in the package which
I'm glad because it's already leaked in
there it says it holds blush eyeshadows
foundation and concealer so it's
basically just
upsetting us Brady got good reviews so I
wanted to try it out all right that is
everything I feel like I'm forgetting
something but that was everything that
was in my bag to show you guys if you
guys like haul videos and you want to
see more make sure you give this video a
thumbs up so I know I have tons of
exciting videos coming out in the next
couple months so I'm super stoked make
sure you're following me on snapchat and
Twitter and Instagram they're all the
