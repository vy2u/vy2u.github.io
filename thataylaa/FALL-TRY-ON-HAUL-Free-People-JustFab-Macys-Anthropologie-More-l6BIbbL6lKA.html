you put your everything I wanna
all right so it is fall in my book which
means it's time to about the bathroom
bodyworksball candles got to get those
Starbucks fall pay cups and a good book
I've been obsessed with Colleen Hoover
lately November 9 is amazing and I'm
currently reading it ends with us
all clothes dark colors are my Jam's so
I did some damage shopping I'm just
gonna do kind of a try on haul situation
so if you guys like this video while
you're watching make sure you give it a
thumbs up and let's jump into it if you
ever need so starting with this military
green jacket I picked this up on like
super sales from Anthropologie and it is
water resistant which is great for
Seattle and it's button-up and then it
has these big pockets on the side which
I just think are a nice touch there you
go for you that's on sale from
Anthropologie this is originally like
100 if do you want to say so if you go
to the lash champ section in Macy's they
have some awesome deals I got this zip
up shirt which I'm obsessed with I feel
like you could zip this down and wear a
bra or just wear it like this with some
baggy jeans tight jeans whatever this
was on clearance for 19 bucks and the
jeans I'm wearing throughout this video
by the way are from Express they're not
new they're like my favorite boyfriend
jeans these shoes are from JustFab I am
in love with them the quality is on
point I got these because they don't
have any boots with cutouts on the side
yet and these you can literally dress up
dress down wear with anything I
typically wear women's size 4 like I
have small freaking feet but they're 5.5
the smallest size fit me for some reason
these run a little bit small each month
for 3995 on JustFab you get a new pair
of shoes in the mail and on the first of
each month all the new styles will show
up in your online boutique and you can
choose a shopper skip by the 5th of each
month so if you're not feeling it that
month you can just opt out this video is
sponsored by JustFab so I'm really the
link in the description box down below
where you can get a VIP member deal wear
your first style is 20 bucks or less and
you get free shipping and exchanges this
next dress is just something that was
telling myself I needed I don't know
when the heck I'm gonna wear this
probably on like New Year's Eve or
something but I just love the beading on
it I got this event Macy's and again it
was on like super clearance I think goes
originally 220 marked down to 35 by 38 I
just love the beading and the way it
sits on my body and you can dress this
up or down I'm wearing boots right now
and then I'm gonna pair this with a
leather jacket leather jackets are my
life you can literally just throw it on
top of yoga pants and a baseball tee and
it just makes it look so much more put
together my favorite leather jacket
right here is from H&amp;amp;M and even though
this is like a fancy dress pairing it
with these boots and the jacket I feel
like just toned it down
I can definitely wear this out in
Seattle
this next sweater is probably one of the
more comfy things I own this is by three
people I got it on sale at Macy's this
is one of the things that I was like
it's this ugly is this too who really
knows but I ended up loving it
fun fact I've lived in Seattle for two
years and throughout this whole time
I've never owned those this is my
official first raincoat this is good
when it's not cold but it's just raining
outside and I need something to not get
wet and things I love the gold buttons
and zipper on here here more on the
petite side sometimes it's really hard
to find jackets that fit right
especially things that rain jackets
I think this super light pink mauve
color is really in this year because I'm
seeing it for game everywhere I love
this blazer the material of it is super
stretchy so it's comfortable one of the
things I hate about wearing Blazers is
they're usually really stiff this one
you can like move around in it's comfy
and it is cropped a little bit in the
back it has a gold zipper and a little
zipper pocket on the side and this I got
from papaya I'm not usually a crop top
person but this one just makes the girls
look good there's something about the
way that it shadows with the kind of
crisscross in the front that just is
really flattering
personally I probably wouldn't wear
that's cropped it'd probably hurt with
like a high-waisted skirt or something
next I got some accessories starting
with Topshop they're having a buy one
get one already markdown sale this
necklace I've actually been looking
online forever and it was marked down to
seven bucks I like that the letter has
more meaning beyond like an initial or
something and then I got these earrings
basically for free since if I only get
one get triangle with the earrings then
I went to Claire's which I don't think
I've walked into Claire's in like five
years but they have these bracelets
which I love for like stacking and
layering then I had a weird urge for
these glasses don't ask
I oddly like them I think they work who
really knows so that is it for the hall
if you guys like this make sure you give
it a thumbs up you can check the
description box down below for anything
that I talked about that I can find I
also have a makeup tutorial on the look
that I'm wearing in this video that will
also be linked down below love you guys
