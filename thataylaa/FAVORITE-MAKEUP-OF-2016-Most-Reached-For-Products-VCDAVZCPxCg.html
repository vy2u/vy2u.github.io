all right I cannot believe the day is
here first video of 2017 is in the new
office I hope you guys can hear that I
think I'm going to need to get a
different mic because this one does pick
up all the sound but let me know what
you think of lighting and background and
everything I have another background
that I might feel that or just switch
between the two
I ask you to come into drizzles it feels
different like it feels different to be
building not crammed between the bed I'm
not going to go on a lot of thing about
2016 I just want to say thank you to you
guys for making this year incredible
2016 was good here so I have a giant bag
of my favorite products of the year
right here I didn't want to do product
releases in 2016 these are just my most
used products in 2016 it didn't
necessarily come out this year these are
just kind of my all-time favorites from
the year I'm thinking about doing a
totally separate video on foundations I
did throw a few foundations in here but
these are just kind of the ones that
stuck out to me this year as you have a
bunch of other foundations that I love
as you finder is now on a giant screen
over here so I can actually see myself
which is great they have to look there
alright let's jump into the products and
Hopkins go in any order my thing about
my most used powder it is definitely the
a cosmetic celebration Sunday Chanel
nomination as a shape there it is a
little bit dark but I feel like that
because it kind of warms up my face a
little bit I love but the finish of this
by the way I'm wearing all everything
that I'm talking about on my face right
now so I am wearing this tottering out
on top of the next foundation that a lot
about this is a powder foundation so it
has a really good coverage on its own
I've worn out a zone before I personally
don't love powder foundations by
themself I like to set my foundation
with powder foundations just because it
gives a little bit more coverage the
finish on this is stunning it gives you
a super pretty skin like
dewy finish I just feel like this is
linen powders that doesn't look like a
powder at all I repurchase this a few
times and most community purchases
I love it so Foundation I have a few
other thrown in here but this one you
guys would probably be able to get this
was quickly climb to the top of my
favorites list this is the derma called
makeup cover foundation holy there
are no words to describe how amazing
this is at escape - Oh AF full review on
this video someone link it down below
you on this video I've had tons of you
guys not anything that you got this and
this is like renewable as Grail vacation
it is unreal
you need the tiniest bit I literally
didn't even squeeze and wearing it right
now into the powder
I didn't even squeeze any out I
literally just used whatever was on the
cabinet completely covered literally
everything I didn't know was possible
but I think this actually has a little
bit more coverage to the market that's a
markable this will literally cover
anything and the thing I love about this
is that it has such a pretty skin like
finish it does not look like you're
wearing a maximum cover foundation at
all I will say I think this breaks me
out which is a major bummer obviously so
I've only been wearing it on special
occasions today when I showing this is
actually New Year's Eve so emma is you
wearing this product tonight but as a
daily foundation something in this I
think breaks me out Amazon sellers have
been jacking up the price of this thing
so you can get it on eBay for cheaper
and I'll leave both of the links down
below kids prices have change - they
always fluctuate but freaking houses so
the next product which I have to mention
because it is my child this is my
lipstick with me - beauty is 1548 what's
on my list right now I explain the full
story behind the name 1548 and why this
is so special to me in the announcement
video it has been so surreal seeing all
of your photos wearing 1548 I'm so happy
you guys love the formula this will
literally stay on like I said and I show
you guys the first impression like a
wear test too but this will literally
stay on anywhere from 7-10 hours with
eating and drinking obviously if you're
eating oily skin this is going to come
off I'm going just about this is a
simple video on it that is definitely
made 2016 special and just seeing all
your guys and support and comments on
that video I'm like tearing up thinking
about it
whenever I'm having a bad day I go back
and read those comments because you guys
just left some unstoppable comments on
that video so thank you for all their
support even if you weren't a little
purchase one by the way these are still
up for sale mtv.com slash 1548 you can't
get free shipping on 225 it up so if you
order to doing a free shipping we're
signalling with that so even if you
weren't able to purchase lunch for
whatever reason thank you for all of
your comments and support and messages
because those are easily as special
thanks to highlighters that I'm going to
bring through because I talked about
both of these five thousand times the
Physicians Formula shimmer brick strip
whatever this is called a natural nude
and SS eyeshadow and zero one snowflake
these are my ride-or-die highlighters
right here this one is two dollars and
eye shadow but it doesn't have that
glittering look to it at all gives your
face a pretty oisin obviously this white
shade will be best if you have more fair
skin if you don't then make a shade
called apricot oh that's really pretty
as well the formulas is so soft and
buttery this I talked about for years
and this remains one my favorite
products of all times drugstore or pans
if you haven't picked this up yet what
the heck are you waiting for
basically I just go in with these few
lighter shades or if you just want to
trade up white champagne kind of
highlights go in here if you have deeper
skin tone you can go and see shades you
can use you just I see shadows so
feeling eyeshadows is something that I
don't talk a lot about my favorite most
war and eyeshadows and they're kind of
just all over the board and that's
because most days when I'm not filming I
literally just use whatever bronzer I
have and put it into the crease but when
I'm doing a full-on
eyeshadow I look these have been my
go-to by shadows this past year this is
the Kerr di shadow palette where you can
basically put any of your own eye
shadows in here - super dirty kids use
it but this case is actually really neat
because it's a super sturdy hard case
Natura it doesn't feel cheap like the
morphe palette this is actually a really
good quality it feels nice and heavy
which is really good for traveling with
and basically I have a mix of everything
to backwards on here so I feel like it
though pretty sure that's a makeup ds1
alright we'll fix that later basically
any of your eyeshadow pants will fit
into this palette of a combo of carrier
shadows in here makeup geek and if it
might be a masculine in here all the
shadows that I'm wearing right now are
from this palette I'm not going to name
up all the individual names I'll just
have them all scription box
I feel like charity shadows are totally
underrated they're almost identical to
matte shadows I did a full video
comparing them and doing dupes
so if you missed that I'll put it in the
eye which is on my lips eyes right there
beautiful affordable same with makeup
geek so not reaching for that policy go
to you might have few months have been
anastagia questioning everything
anastacio Modern Renaissance palette
this has been very high def like most of
her products are and I haven't had a
whole lot of great experience with the
rest of on associate product
I like the dip brow and that's pretty
much it but this eyeshadow palette I
love I go to kind of everyday colors are
usually the six down here this is
stunning if you need to polish a wedding
makeup the shade
primavera and Vermeer are beautiful
these are super pigmented but when you
blend them they don't just blend away
which is what I love about them you're
looking for a warm eyeshadow palette I
think these are totally worth it my
three no-brainer
used almost everyday products for me are
the physicians for my license during
altar block make sure you get the OSHA
black one to get the other one not that
black at all this has the perfect amount
of stiffness to the tip it's what I use
in almost every video
so stays on me super blackett isnt matts
if you like a matte liquid liner you
probably won't like this if you're
beginner with winged liner get this just
put it on at night before you wash your
face and just practice that's what I
used to do when I first got into makeup
is just put on makeup and play around it
nice because if they're looking a little
funky who cares
wash it off my second one is the Wet n
Wild mega length class garrus what I use
on my bottom lashes every single day the
third is the Too Faced present best
mascara I don't have it because there
accidentally left it at home and you
could get a double four here but that is
my go-to mascara if I'm ever only
wearing mascara and video it'll be the
Tuesday's presence next mascara if
you've tried it and you proud that it
transferred or you don't quibble II love
it let it dry out for a couple weeks
open the cap a little bit and screw it
back on and just let it sit there for a
couple weeks I don't like it when I
first get it I have to let it dry out a
little bit right this is going to be how
long video by the way if you haven't
already go pods grab a snack get some
coffee
beer whatever you want wouldn't eat it
2016 favors video without mentioning
tart shape shape this is amazing full
coverage doesn't crease this is
hands-down my favorite concealer close
second is urban decay naked skin
concealer but this one definitely pulled
ahead this year I have to chase Barron
it works really well for me you guys
have probably heard 5,000 things about
the concealer if you watch YouTube or on
Instagram so let's move us in that
product favorite under-eye powder this
year has definitely been the stargazer
powder I only recommend this if you have
fair skin this is my straight up white
powder a lot of white powders tend to be
very chalky this one is super soft to
give you beautiful highlight under the
eyes what I'm wearing right now we're
pretty much everyday does not look too
stark white but it also doesn't not add
any color that makes it so this is five
bucks can get off of Amazon gosh they're
like another more recent eye that I've
totally fallen in love with is the
benefit Kris I
my brow brow pencil I have to shade for
but that's when I had the gray hair so I
need to go up a couple shades now that
my hair is back to dark this is great
now I was not sent any of the benefit
products I know they did a huge youtuber
launch with that collection this is the
only product that I have from that brow
line I purchased it myself since it is
so fun actually brush on hair strokes
stays on really well I'm going to be
having a whole video coming out about my
favorite contour product but the
standout product is here for me with the
elf eyebrow kit in the shade light I not
find it for the life of me right now
between moving and 9907 eye makeup here
and some of it at home couldn't find it
at home that I was in the office it's
not here either so I'm gonna have to
order any ones I will insert a photo
right here as you can see what it is I
use the lighter shade if your peel skin
is perfect for contour it's not too warm
it's not too actually but it was out
really well base and it's a few books I
was in my most reach for runs of
appearance and the hourglass ambient
luminous bronze light this one you have
to be careful with is your similar to my
skin tones because it can look really
warm and a little bit orange II really
fast to be used too much I literally
barely tap my brush in here to have it
on today so you can't get it to look
really nice and subtle which they made
this in like one lighter shade because I
love the formula of this it just blend
out so easily you're not going to get
some weird drag and you try and pour
them on top of foundation it gives you a
super super subtle I don't take blow
because it's not like a shimmering
product but this makes you look really
healthy just the cover of X illuminating
setting powder I mentioned this the time
my foundation videos but I'm not using a
cosmetic powder I will likely use this
product my skin does not do well with
loose setting powders baking
no way in hell I tried to bake probably
30 times every time it looks absolutely
horrendous on my skin I tried to clear
some powder a kiss Laura Mercier try
them all something with loose powders
that allow the
as it just takes away the coverage of my
foundation it gives me this weird and a
texture to my skin this is one of the
only powders that doesn't do that it
adds coverage it is light enough and it
does give you a really pretty kind of
flow the thing I most least less severe
with the covergirl trublend blush in the
shade medium rose this one you just
can't go wrong with gives you a really
nice rosy cheek not to attend has a
little bit of a glow to it this one just
goes with any look pretty much what all
yours
Accu other foundation products that i
want to mention this is technically not
a foundation but it is I don't know why
they call it a BB cream but this is the
covergirl clean matte fini in the shade
510 affair and a whole review on this
product that was an urgent coffee break
this is too dark for my skin that I have
to mix it in with something but if you
have oily skin this will stay on your
face literally all day I don't get oily
at all when I wear this has a really
nice kind smoothing finish to it it is
very hot so for me I like to mix this in
with the doer and lighter product to lay
in it and give it a little bit less of a
matte finish some pretty good coverage
is about medium coverage not a second
layer I can get this full coverage on
its own if you have oily skin try this
out it is amazing last foundation I'm
going to talk about in this video you
can probably get this is the target
force of the sea foundation they
recently came out with this shade which
is porcelain thank you tart because fair
neutral was not filled princess friendly
I've watched these two next to each
other in my the wet and wild new
foundations I just reviewed the monastic
swatches of these two shades can go
watch that video again have a full
review on this so I'm not going guest
about it but it just is stunning it
looks like skin I can build this up like
a high medium all the full coverage I
love mixing this in with other
and last clearly well throughout the day
on the if I said it was a powder this
foundation with this powder is on my
favorite combos and a few lip products
to mention I don't want to go crazy list
as I just did a whole favorite drugstore
in new lipsticks video a lot of products
pretty frequently but these are my other
most grease for lip products essays so
this is color pop cookie this one goes
with anything it's hard to find a new
champ it's not too peachy especially
from colour-pop if you like some of
their news pull really teach the
amortize the lippie stix are really nice
moisturizing formula smell like vanilla
cake also by color top is the fairy
floss gloss this is this beautiful the
formula these are great they're not
sticky at all fairies gloss is a really
nice kind of like nudie pink this looks
beautiful on top of any new lipstick
this I love wearing it by itself or on
top of lip products this is the wet and
wild color icon lip gloss in the shade
Jack yellow mode I'm pretty sure this
was going to be with an addition I still
seen it in drugstores not sure if
they're just having it till it's totally
filled out or what but this is a
beautiful light pink lip gloss if you're
really pretty Sheen to your lips I would
say one of my most reach for liquid
lipsticks this year has been the Too
Faced melted matte in the shade a cool
girl
great yes I was not banned the Too Faced
melted lipsticks I hate those get all
over your face all your teeth I do not
like those at all but the milton mass
are totally different if you didn't like
the melted lipsticks
don't let that interfere with trying
these out because this is a straight up
liquid lipstick
drive down Matt where it's really well
throughout the day doesn't smell the
greatest smells like straight a pimple
this color is he working for a lot of
different skin tones I've seen it look
like a light nude on more deeper skin
tones on me this is a pretty new
this is almost like borderline Brown
dude pretty dark on me but I feel like I
can still wear it out like for a few
store on errands and it doesn't look
like I'm wearing fancy lipstick no I
mean so you don't really talk about my
favorite islands I wanted to throw this
innocence in my favorite for a couple
years now and use this in a kind of shot
of whose videos this is the LA girl
glide gel liner I use this for my
waterline stays on all day doesn't burn
my eyes
it is super black you can get this on
ITA house I believe everything will be
linked down below that I'm talking about
but I got this for a couple bucks it's
great I just have a single lashes that
literally just finished why did you pick
these inside the other month okay so
favorite lashes this year are definitely
the carrot f-4s and want more of a
natural lash you still looks like soft
lashes like they're going to give you a
little bit of volume and everything but
they don't look over the top these are
dollar lashes you can get these on I
Kate house or shop today I think Thomas
day actually the care grand are pretty
much identical it's like ardell lashes
it's a really nice size band that all
their lashes are dollar F fours are my
favorite ones they're already sold out
on there so if you find them get like
ten pairs to get this sell out really
quickly as the most reach your lashes
here are the aisle or number 121 what I
have one right now these have more
volume and lashes on the outer half so
it gives you that really nice kind of
cat eyes look where I'm literally only
wearing eyeliner to cover up the band
right now I don't have on a ton of
liquid liner so all of the blacks
volume that you're seeing are front
lashes you have a thicker band
I don't mind it because a I don't keep
my lashes on all day I'll ask you
totally irritate my eyes hood usually
only wear out for a few hours so I'm not
super bothered by the stick band helpful
I just love the shape of these that I
overlooked it alright so we are coming
down to the last two products so this is
the Make Up For Ever mission six setting
spray feel like I've talked about this a
whole lot but I love this this isn't the
second bottle
and halfway down this one if you have
tried a bunch of different setting
sprays you don't really feel like
they're doing anything this is one that
you will notice a difference this would
be perfect for like special events
dangerous really new your makeup to stay
on all day it gives you a dewy finish I
ran out of my cards handy setting spray
but that was also a favorite this year
that black bottles part Kenya setting
spray if you don't want to spend just
like 30 bucks or whatever it is for this
setting spray get the hard candy one it
also rough so with last product is that
I love makeup goddess of love triple
baked highlighter God is a safe place
the name lots of goddesses so this is my
makeup revolution I believe they just
switched to tan beauty and accessor new
names this thing is hard to get your
hands on now it's a disease and meshing
this because of that but this really is
one of the most stunning highlighters
you can still buy this on eBay it's more
than it was but I'm pretty sure it still
under 15 bucks but I've used this in
multiple videos if you want to see an
action only two shadows down below very
first try it out this I love because you
can really make it look more natural or
super intense depending on how much you
use coming on right now and I just use a
light hand space because I wanted it
just look kind of more natural but it
gives you that what kind of highlight
look it doesn't look shocking or
glittery or anything just gives you a
really nice Sheen looks looking that
wearing shirt right now so those were my
