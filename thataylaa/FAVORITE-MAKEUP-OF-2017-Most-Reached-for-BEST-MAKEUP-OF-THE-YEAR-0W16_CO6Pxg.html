it is 2018 I remember that year used to
sound so futuristic
and now we're almost a 2020 I think 2017
was a pretty intense year for a lot of
people hope that we can all come
together in 2018 and you know move
forward in the right direction here the
best that we can we're just talking
about makeup today so I'm gonna keep it
at that I just wanted to thank you guys
for being a huge part of 2017 for me and
being with me through the last six years
which is crazy I've almost been on
YouTube for seven years now they
actually have a whole video on this look
it's the New Year's Eve makeup look so
I'll link that in the I over here and
down below in the description box but
we're gonna be talking about the best
products of 2017 these are kind of my
most reach for most used products
they're not products that necessarily
came out okay my hair is stuck in my
armpit they're not products that
necessarily came out this year they're
just ones that I found myself using most
often this year
you guys have heard me talk about all
these at some point because they really
are products that have stood out that I
continuously reach for and that I love
and 110% recommend to you guys so I did
this exact video last year so if you
want to see what my favorites were then
I'm not mentioning any repeat products
it just so happens that I actually have
almost the exact amount of high-end and
drugstore products in this video it's
pretty half half I have about 24
products here so I'm gonna try and power
through this or else we're gonna be
sitting here for two hours if you're
excited for this video don't forget to
give it a thumbs up everything I'm
talking about will be linked down below
in the description box so all of my
products are in a Marshalls bag right
now I'm just gonna dig in I'm not going
in any order right now I'm just gonna
pull stuff out so here we go
Maybelline fit me loose powder and 0-5
this is a bomb if you have oily skin for
setting the milk makeup blur liquid
which is also a 2017 favorite this
foundation with this powder I did a
whole video showing you this routine at
some makeup for photography video this
combo is bomb let me know if you've
tried this combo down below I love this
foundation talked about a 50,000 times
great coverage you can search the Taylor
in the name of any product if you want
to see me talk more in depth about it
this loose powder actually has some
coverage and pigment to it which is what
I love about it any kind of translucent
powders just don't set the best on my
skin so I like this one has some color
to it gives you such a beautiful
flawless smooth
to finish another powder they've been
using for years now but especially in
the last year is the laura geller
balance in Brighton powder this is in
the shade porcelain and I use this now
still when I have dry skin just on my
cheek area to set my foundation so that
when I blend powder products on top like
bronzer and highlight and everything
they just glide over smoothly but this
powder I loved when I set my entire face
because it gives you this subtle glow
the glow isn't as intense as like the a
cosmetic celebration foundation
illumination doesn't look like you're
wearing a heavy powder anything and I
just love the finished shade everything
of this powder I feel like this whole
year was a blur so I can't quite
remember what products released when but
I'm pretty sure this deal of magnificent
metals launched this year right I think
it was this year if so I feel like this
is one of the best launches of the year
the thing I love about this is that
there's been liquid glitter kind of
formulas out before but not ones that
are so jam-packed with glitter like the
steel of my nificent metal is my
favorite shade is diamond dust it kind
of shifts to whatever color is
underneath it so if you put it on top of
a pink shadow it looks a little bit more
pink and like rose gold and you put on a
silver it looks more silver don't get
the glitter fall out since it is like a
liquid glitter I mean I'm sure you've
all seen this at some point but just put
it right on top as like a last step I
wouldn't really blend shadows on top of
this afterwards use this as your last
eyeshadow step actually kind of matches
my nail polish right now if you are into
glitter and you didn't pick this up this
year get this it is worth it so this
product launched in the last few months
this is the hourglass ambient strobe
light palette looks like this on the
inside you get three shades I've used
this in a ton of videos at this point it
gives you that intense strobe it really
is like a strobe highlight but you don't
get glitter you don't get texture it
just gives you that bang intense
highlight out emphasizing texture
without doing gross things on your face
when I wear this I actually just mix all
three shades beautiful that's an inner
corner highlight as well this is nothing
like the previous hourglass highlighters
this is the best one hands-down in my
opinion I have a few different nude
lipsticks in here and you guys probably
guess all of them this is the l'oreal
infallible paints matte liquid lipstick
so balm i love the shade of this this is
just a very wearable nude lipstick on my
skintone
then fallible I can't read it was called
pose more like the wet didn't really dry
down it was like the wet sticky kind of
formula I was really turned off but he's
been really glad I'd tried this because
the form is totally different this one
is like just a liquid lipstick a matte
liquid lipstick that dries down
beautiful nude shade if you're around my
skin tone became news here's another one
that I've worn a shit-ton this is the
Sephora
it's the lip why can't I speak right now
lip stain cream lip stain in the shade
32 this one is much lighter than the
L'Oreal one I like to layer this on
other things or I'll wear by itself but
it does give you that kind of dead nude
look which sometimes I'm really
intuitions formula butter blushes this
was such a great release this year the
formula of these are spot-on they blend
out easily have just the right amount of
color in my opinion then you just get
that really pretty kind of flawless
flush I haven't found a shade that I
didn't like but these two shades are
rosy pink and plum rose I wear both of
these this one gives you that really
pretty kind of pink flush this one
definitely looks more natural smell like
coconut / sunscreen my most worn lashes
of the year were by pure cosmetics I
love the pure lashes the fans are on the
thicker side so if you're someone who
likes to really thin Ardell kind of band
you won't like these these are more like
the Isle or lash bands but these last so
many friggin uses I literally wear each
pair of these about 15 times and just
kind of wear them till they totally die
or they have like too many colors of
eyeshadow on the band so my favorite
styles are jet setter I'll try and find
pictures wearing each one and include it
on here these ones give you that really
pretty separated doll light kind of eye
which I'm a big fan of trend setter is
my other favorite one which I don't have
a pair of right now have gone through
all them and then diva are my other
favorite so you can just search again to
see what each style looks like on my eye
but I just love these lashes I find that
they last forever they're cruelty free
okay can I just say I still feel like
this is one of the most underrated
products out there right now this is the
BH Studio Pro total coverage concealer I
hope this catches on on youtube-land
because this is a balm concealer it is
beautiful it's full coverage it sets
down it is right up there with
heart-shape tape for me the only thing I
don't like about this and the only
reason why I
reach for this every single day is
because of the applicator by the way I
wear the shade 101 they did come out
with lighter shades but 101 is pretty
good for me I hate the applicator on
this I wish it was just a doe foot
applicator it would be so much more
pleasant to apply some people might
really like this applicator for me I
just find it to be a little bit messy
and it just kind of pain the ass but the
formula of this concealer if you haven't
tried it any like full coverage
concealers you need to this concealer is
also literally a few bucks it's like
under five bucks BH Cosmetics has some
great stuff this is one of their best
products that they've ever come out with
in my opinion this primer so many of you
guys have snapped me saying that you
tried this and you loved it and that
makes me really happy because I find
it's really hard to find a good primer
that actually does what it says this is
the Revlon Photoready pore reducing
primer this one will not necessarily
make your makeup last any longer it's
just really great for filling in your
pores and I do use this you can visibly
see it filling in your pores I don't
find that it breaks me out I feel like
this actually does something and you've
been looking for a pore reducing primer
try this I have tried benefit
Porefessional
a lot of the pore filling primers and I
find that this drugstore one does the
job this is one of my favorite priming
sprays for that dewy look this is a Too
Faced hangover 3 and one rx mentioned
this is a ton lately it silicone
free alcohol-free oil free it's bomb it
smells like coconut gives you that dewy
really fresh-faced kind of look even if
I'm not wearing makeup that day I'll
still spray this on if I'm gonna go run
errands or whatever because it just
gives you a really pretty glow I love
using this over my makeup too it makes
your highlight pop it really makes it
stand out and gives it like a little
extra something it says you can use this
a prime set or refresh so literally use
it for whatever you want if I actually
liked using when I was a and now that
I'm dry so I feel like this will work
across all skin types this really helps
to settle the powder with your liquid
foundation and just make it look like
your face but it will give you a super
dewy finish so don't get it if you don't
like that so next up is a total splurge
item this is literally if you just want
to splurge because this highlighter is
like in the $60 range which is very
pricey clearly but this is the Burberry
fresh glow highlighter and pink pearl it
is so pretty so pretty not only is it
packaging beautiful you get this
design on here I have a lot of videos
wearing this if you want to see what it
looks like gives you a light pink kind
of pearl highlight that just never looks
bad one that's actually pretty similar
to it and gives you a similar effect is
the one I'm wearing actually right now
and this is by JK is the you glow girl
Bella Rose highlighter these are pretty
similar this one has been another
favorite of the year I only recommend
this shade in this formula I don't
recommend any of the other J cap
highlighters I've tried the other shades
and there's something different about
the formula they're a little bit more
chalky and glittery this one is
beautiful JK is now created on Ulta so
if you like that light pink intense
highlight look might like this this one
I was debating mentioning because it is
definitely more recent find but I am in
love with this thing I haven't wanted to
use a different blush since I got this
this is the CIPA summer love I talked
about this in my November raves and
rejects the formula this is spot on
easy to blend out gives you the most
airbrush kind of blush look it's
beautiful I've already ordered a second
shade haven't tried this one yet but I
got the shade into deep which looks like
kind of a lavender color which I don't
really have a blush like this so I'm
excited to try this I know I'm gonna end
up getting every shade in this blush
because it's just that good it's
definitely one of the more hard to mess
up blush formulas if you know what I
mean you don't really have to try so and
I was thinking about eyeshadow palettes
that I use the most this year only two
popped into my head
the Anastacio Beverly Hills modern
renaissance palette which I actually
included in last year's favorites so
that's how long that one has been a
favorite so I didn't want to talk about
that one again and the only other
palette that really stuck out to me that
I absolutely ended up loving is the
morphe jacqueline hill palette we all
know what this one looks like I've
talked about this a lot so I'm not going
to go in depth about this but there's
something about the form of these
especially the Browns that just look
amazing every single time they don't
blend away they're super pigmented the
light champagne shades are beautiful as
a face highlight and on the inner corner
or just all over the lid I do still want
to do a bridal makeup look I've
literally been talking about that for
like two years I just don't want to do
it I feel like the light champagne
shades in here would be perfect for that
if you've been debating getting this one
I think
is worth it it's a great palette it's
what I travel with every single time I
travel if I'm only bringing one
eyeshadow palette I'll just bring this
because there are so many different
looks you can do with this standout kind
of contour slash bronzer you can kind of
use this for both shade for me this year
was the Kevin Kwan celestial bronzing
veil tropical nights every time I hear
Kevin Taquan now I just think of Kylie
cosmetics comparing herself to him lol
if you have fair skin this light shade
right here is perfection for a
cool-toned
contour shade I love mixing all three of
these if I want more of a bronzer look
I'll going with like the middle right
here I just love that you get basically
multiple shades in one it is pricey but
I think it's worth it because I've reach
for this a shit-ton and it has a little
bit of like a glow in it to the point
where it just looks flattering it
doesn't look shimmery I don't find but I
don't really mind that like this this
blush is an illuminating blush I like
that look on my face I don't find it to
be you know overly shimmery or anything
but there it is right there my go-to
brow products since I tried this has
been the benefit cabro gel this is great
I like this better than the Anastacio
dip brow really similar to the anastacio
dip brow there's just something I like a
little bit more about this one and it
does come with a brush up here and ever
really use the brush but if you're
traveling or whatever you could
definitely use the brush it's just a
little bit too stiff I kind of go back
and forth between pencil and gel eye
brow products just depending on what my
brows are looking like you guys know how
I feel about brows they're not my thing
I don't I don't enjoy doing my brows I
kind of just do whatever's easiest
in the moment and will get the job done
and this gets the job done you know so
this foundation is one that I found
during the last 15 days of foundation
series and it is beautiful if you like
medium coverage dewy and you want
something that just looks really natural
and plumping and beautiful the estee
lauder double wear a nude water fresh
makeup is is that even when I had oily
skin it lasts surprisingly well on my
skin I would wear this way more often on
its own if the shade was right at the
lighter shade one see one cool bone and
it's a little bit dark so I do have to
mix this and it just looks so smooth so
plumping
fresh it really does look fresh I wish
they came out with more shades in this
but it's a really beautiful foundation
all right we are down to the final two
products both of which are lipsticks
liquid lipsticks this is the wet and
wild liquid katsu in nudi patootie I've
talked about this five billion times I
just love the shade it's a beautiful
light cool tone shade again similar to
the 32 by Sephora I would wear it with a
lip liner I do wear it sometimes without
a lip liner without layering on
something but it is pretty light it's a
very cool tone nude so it can make you
look a little bit dead this is a few
bucks from the drugstore totally dries
down to a matte liquid lipstick not the
most moisturizing definitely feels a
little bit drying on the lips but not to
the point where I find it to be super
uncomfortable to wear and it's hard to
find a drugstore lipstick that is this
light which I feel like is what's kind
of special about this the last product
is one I mentioned in my top 10 red
liquid lipsticks video which I'll link
in the eye and down below if you missed
that this is Smashbox bang bang they're
always on liquid lipstick formula by
Smashbox is beautiful such a great
formula doesn't feel super drying on the
lips comfortable to wear lasts amazing
throughout the day I love the applicator
on here it has like a little triangle
pointed applicator that just makes it
easy to get that line the shade bang
bang is a nice bright red so flattering
if you have fair skin if you haven't
tried the always on liquid lipstick
formula they are bomb so obviously that
wasn't all of my favorite makeup from
the year you can go back and watch the
race and rejects playlist if you want to
see my top products from each month
these were just kind of the ones when I
was looking back and looking through my
makeup collection everything these are
the products I felt like I use the most
that really stood out and I have a whole
other video and all my favorite high
coverage foundations and things like
that I'm gonna be trying to break down
and do top foundation videos by like
category so those will be coming let me
know down below what your favorite
products of 2017 were because I am
always on the lookout for new good
products if you enjoyed this video don't
