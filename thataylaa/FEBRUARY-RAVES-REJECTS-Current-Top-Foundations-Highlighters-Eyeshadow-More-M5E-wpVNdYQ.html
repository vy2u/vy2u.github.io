someone's like staring right at you or
not I know she's looking at the wall
all right so today we have a little
raves and rejects action it's been a
while since we've been here doing the
raisin rejects mostly because I don't
know where the heck the last three
months have gone I do have a one
shoulder sleeve shirt on whatever this
is called but it kind of looks like a
more my birthday suit so some of these
things I've been using for the last two
three months some of them are newer
things that I've just fallen in love
with when I'm filming this I actually
just landed back in Seattle from San
Diego last night and woke up this
morning feeling pretty sick my throat
doesn't feel great right now we are
gonna make it through this video with a
voice hopefully so let's get into it if
you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the baby doe
family and subscribe I upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific
time the announcement video is now live
for 15 days of foundation I'm gonna
leave that video down below don't forget
t-shirts are up right now 100% of the
proceeds go to project beauty share and
there's a whole other thing going on for
the next series of 15 days of
foundations so make sure you've watched
that announcement video down below
alright I want to start out with
something that I am so pleasantly
surprised by because I just didn't think
I was gonna like this product as much as
I loved it I typically don't like loose
kind of powders especially with
highlighters but this is the jcat pearl
Luminizer luxe pearl powder this is like
six or seven bucks somewhere around
there you can get on altos website raved
about this in videos on Instagram on
snapchat I'm in love this is such a
beautiful highlighter I'm wearing it
right now but I did my makeup without
the lights on and I feel like now that
the lights are on you can't really see
it let's just apply some more shall we
my favorite highlight brush Sigma fo3
the thing I love about this powder
there's multiple things first thing I
love is that you can completely build
this up and customize it so if you want
a super natural look and highlight one
day you can achieve that if you want to
build it up and have a super intense
reflective highlight you can do that
with this you can also use a big fluffy
brush and use that as kind of an
all-over
face powder and when you first put it on
you can see like the stripe there and it
looks scary and once you actually blend
it out it just melts into your skin and
blends in so freakin beautifully I just
love how it sits on the skin it doesn't
overly emphasized my texture when the
Sun is out this is like one of those
beaming highlighters it is so freaking
stunning I don't even know if I finished
my train of thought about the big fluffy
brush but basically you can use it
if you want it all over kind of glow
just use it with a super big brush like
this this is the morphe one but it's
basically just a huge bendy flimsy kind
of fluffy brush so you can just super
lightly dust this all over your face as
an all-over kind of glow powder all
right so let's move on to foundations
I'm having a lot of fun trying out
foundations that I already own just to
see if they work differently for my skin
now that I'm more normal to dry that
didn't work out for me when I was I
leave before a keychain and there's been
a few products that have worked totally
different for my skin now and also a few
products that I used to love for my oily
skin that just look like trash on my
skin right now so that just goes to show
what I always say foundations work
differently for different people
depending on your skin depending on your
needs and a foundation and what you like
in a foundation so it's been really fun
for me to experiment with that I think
I'm gonna do a video on foundations that
didn't used to work for me that work for
me now but I have a lot to try out so
that video probably won't be coming for
a while but point being I have a few
foundations that are just my go-to s
right now it looked great on dry skin
that I can pretty much mix with anything
and they look phenomenal
so the first foundation which is looking
not as cleanest is the dermablend smooth
liquid camo foundation I have the shades
linen and cream I think is the other one
they're both way too dark and yellow for
my skin tone so I do have to mix these
but this foundation is one of the few
foundations that I feel like looks
beautiful across all skin types it
looked great when I had oily skin it
looks beautiful on dry skin I say this
about medium to full coverage depending
on how much you use and how you build it
up the thing I love about this is that
it is so thin and weightless and the
finish of it is like skin it sits on the
skin so beautifully and it's one of
those that is just great to mix in with
foundations I think it was in a shadow
and shmooze where someone asked what
foundation I would recommend for
weddings and this is one of the few
foundations that I feel like I can
recommend across all skin types that is
just beautiful on texture on top of acne
when I had it on top of dry skin
patchiness whatever it is this
foundation looks beautiful I wish they
came out with like four lighter shades
in this shade because I would just wear
this on its own if they had that but I
do mix this in and the thing I really
like mix it in with is my CYO life proof
foundation which I raved about in
November rays and rejects this is still
one of my goat
Foundations actually picked up a shade
darker this is this is 102 I've been
using 101 if I have a foundation that I
need to lighten I'll use 101 if I just
wear it on its own I'll mix these two
shades because 102 for whatever reason
oxidizes like crazy one on one doesn't
oxidize that all this is a freaking
beautiful six or seven dollar foundation
from Walgreens you need to try this out
it is the most smoothing plumping
beautiful finish if you like dewy
foundations or even if you don't and you
have a really matte foundation that you
just want to add a little bit of life to
it which is the next one I'm going to be
talking about also great for that
purpose if you want to know my full
thoughts on this foundation and check
out November rays and rejects as I went
into it there I do have a handful of
videos using that foundation you can
always just search the Tayla CYO
foundation or whatever foundation you
want to see and a video will pop up if I
have it so the matte foundation I was
talking about that I've been mixing CYO
in with is the Catrice HD liquid
coverage foundation I'm wearing this
combo on my skin right now and this is
what I've been doing if I want a matte
look but I don't want it to basically
look like total on my dry skin
again this foundation is so friggin dark
for this being the light shade I have a
whole review on this I think it was
during the last 15 days the foundation
is ranked in the top during my last
series ranking video this is such a
beautiful matte matte full coverage
foundation where it doesn't look too
heavy doesn't look too cakey it gives
you this like very airbrushed smooth
matte look cannot wear this along to the
lightest shade as hell dark so I mix it
in with the CYO and 101 and what this
does mixed in is it lightens it but it
also just adds a little tiny bit more
like a satin finish to it
this thing is so mad that it'll pretty
much mattify out any dewy product that
you mix in that's how math this thing is
the formulas beautiful Catrice please
expand the shade range I think this is a
completely underrated foundation I know
whenever I talk about this there's some
comments saying that this has the same
ingredients as a Fenton foundation I
don't know man for whatever reason Fenty
looks like pure C's on my skin
this looks entirely different it is a
totally different foundation they look
nothing like on my skin when I had oily
skin and now so I don't know but this is
great thing goes around the end of
January early February was like the time
of blush releases for whatever reason
and I have two three I guess that I am
just obsessed with that I've been
reaching for almost every
single day versus the Jew a blush duos I
feel like you guys are probably gonna be
seeing these in a ton of people's
favorites videos because they're one of
those formulas that it's just hard to
find something wrong with them they are
beautiful they blend out easily they're
not too pigmented they're not too sheer
my first favorite is this duo the adore
blush duo these ones are the perfect
natural blush if you're someone who
doesn't like wearing a lot of blush or
if you're doing a really intense eye
look and just want something super
natural this to give your cheeks like a
little bit of color to them where it's
not pink it's not too mob it's not too
cool toned warm tone just very neutral
this one is beautiful especially this
shade this one has like a tiny bit of a
sheen to it almost as you can see if you
have fair skin this could almost be used
as like a bronzer that's how it looks on
my skin tone a little bit but the other
shade is definitely more peachy and this
one warms up your face quite a bit if
you want something more neutral mix the
two shades I have a mix of those two
shades on my cheeks right now let's add
a little bit of the peach one in here
I'm just gonna go in with this guy wow
that mirrors looking great just so you
can see the color that you can get with
this shade so pretty
they friggin nailed the formulas on
these man the other shade that I really
love is Coquette and you get two pink
shades in here I usually go for this one
this one is definitely too dark for my
skin tone but this light pink shade is
really beautiful the other blush which
is just right up my alley for what I
usually go for with blushes this is the
NARS free soul blush oh man I've used
this in a few videos recently it's
almost like a blush topper in a way it's
basically this shimmery super light pink
blush I personally love a glowy blush if
there's no glitter in it and if it
doesn't emphasize my like cheek texture
and this one I don't find does do I like
it better to them my ciate glow blushes
probably not those are still like my
number one but this shade in just the
way it makes your skin glow it's so
pretty I love using this on days when
I'm just using like a tinted moisturizer
it really just gives you that super
natural kind of flush you don't like
glowy blushes do not get this this is a
very glowy blush I had to mention this
guy because Maybelline answered our
prayers and finally after what how long
is this concealer been out like ten
years at this point the Maybelline fit
me concealer they finally launched new
shades of this they launched deeper
shades they launched lighter shades the
shade range before was pretty
obviously I've been using the shade 15
in this concealer because 15 is lighter
than the shape 10 was now I'm using the
shade 5 shade 5 is definitely more
yellow if I like the lightness of it so
I've been just mixing these two shades
now quite a big difference there which
is awesome there's the shade 5 and
there's 15 so when I mix these together
it's kind of like my perfect concealer
shade and it works really well I'm
pretty sure this is sold out everywhere
right now maybe it's restocked by time
this video goes up but this is the
ordinary rosehip oil I have to mention
this because I think this has done
wonders for my acne scarring I'm
currently on accutane I recently did a
four month update video so I'll link
that video down below to if you missed
it but this is what I've been using for
my scarring almost every single night I
would say use this yeah probably every
single night maybe like five times a
week
all it is is a hundred percent organic
cold-pressed rosehip oil so if this is
holdout you can probably find something
similar on Amazon or something but I've
actually seen a difference in the
scarring since I started using this
stuff so it's a bomb it's super
affordable I think this is like around
10 bucks or under so another highlighter
here this first one is what I brought on
my Europe trip is the only highlighter
that I brought this is the cover FX
moonlight and I went to check Sephora
because this was a travel size and
apparently it was limited ition so I
don't think they're making this exact
size anymore this thing was only ten
bucks so I feel like that was the steal
I hope they still keep the travel size
of this but you can get it into full
size to this cover FX highlighter is so
beautiful I've won this in a few videos
so you can search it but if you like
that really reflective highlight that
just sits beautifully on top of the skin
doesn't emphasize texture this one has a
light gold kind of shade to it so
watches some highlighters I feel like a
kind of pointless cuz it doesn't even do
it justice when it hits the light it
almost has this white champagne look to
it that is just it's gorgeous
all right last highlighter I feel like
this is a month of blushes and
highlighters but God I mentioned this
bad boy because oh my gosh this is the
XO Beauty Aurora powder radiant glow
highlight powder this one looks like
nothing in the pan like nothing exciting
it looks almost like a face powder in
the pan but when you put it on your skin
it's one of those powders that just
totally gives you the most subtle it's
not even uh okay how do I explain this
in the right way it's one of those
highlighters that really is like a glow
from within look which
sounds ridiculous but it isn't a
reflective beaming highlighter like
something like the cover effects one
it's nothing like that this is one if
you like a really natural glowy
radiant look you need this powder in
your life even again with a brush like
this as like a finishing powder it looks
beautiful
I've just been reaching for this more on
a daily basis I'm getting like weird
reflective things out of the corner of
my eye this packaging right now like I
can't see can also see this working
really well on more mature skin if
you're someone who enjoys the really
frosty beaming highlight whether you're
my age younger or you have more mature
skin then by all means go for it I mean
it's makeup you can do whatever you want
but I feel like this would sit really
nicely I'm more mature skin and just add
a little bit of something where it
doesn't look like too much should we
just add this on - let's do it I'm gonna
add a little bit this to my forehead I
really like highlighting my forehead
with this - just the high points right
here because it just adds a little bit
of something and a little bit of glow so
pretty next product I mentioned about 50
dozen times on my channel but it's a
Catrice prime and fine contouring
palette I had to give this one another
mention I'm sure I've mentioned this in
a raisin Rejects at some point but I've
been reaching for this almost every
single day it's just one of those
products that I know is gonna look good
no matter what look I do it's not too
cool toned it's not too warm toned it
blends out easily it's from the
drugstore I'm wearing it on my face
right now this one really depends how
you apply it if you apply it with a
really light hand you can get kind of a
more contour look if you apply it with
just a bronzer brush or a brush like
this you're gonna get more pigment and
more of like a warm tone to it which is
how I applied it today highlight in here
is also beautiful I brought this I guess
I had two highlights because I brought
this one to Europe - super pretty light
white pink shade when I first used this
highlight I was not impressed at all but
I think it's one that you got to really
rub off the top layer and then you get
into it and it is like finding gold I
have three eyeshadow palettes here that
I find myself reaching for most often
these palettes are pretty hard to have a
bad eye shadow look in my opinion just
the way that they blend everything about
them I just love the way my makeup turns
out every time I use them the first is
the BH Cosmetics zodiac palette I think
I have two or three videos using this a
couple different looks you have this
ring of mattes on the middle and then
you have shimmer shades on the outside
and
a super shimmery white shade this ring
of Matt's on the inside are so soft
pigmented blendable everything you want
in eyeshadow I used the pinks in a video
I've used I think the Blues what else of
use I love doing a really basic just
matte Brown kind of look with this
palette because look at those friggin
brown shades they blend out so
beautifully I feel like if you're a
beginner with eyeshadow there goes both
palettes cool I think if you're a
beginner with eyeshadow and you want to
just experiment with more color this is
a great palette to start with because
they are very easy to work with and this
palette is super affordable BH Cosmetics
always goes on sale but I think the
cheapest I've seen this is about $11 $11
folks $11 I'm going to swatch some
shimmer shades for you by the way I'm
wearing Gemini that silver shade on my
lid a little bit right now and then the
other shades I'm wearing are from the
other two palettes I'm gonna talk about
but here are some of the shimmers so yo
I think is one of my favorites it's like
this icy white pink shade
okay I just tried to swatch one on my
knuckle that didn't work out very well
so the other two palettes I've been
reaching for most often are 2 by morphe
the 24 G and the 39a
I thought the 39a was gonna be like a
limited edition holiday thing but then I
saw that they still had it in stock I
think was on old tubs on there the other
day they still had it in stock I don't
know if they're making that permanent or
what but this is one of the most
beautiful laid out palettes color wise I
mean I don't know maybe it's just me but
I find this so satisfying to look at the
color assortment here is beautiful I
could be totally making this up but I
feel like there was once a Crayola set
or like a crayon set that had these kind
of gem tones in it and that's exactly
what this palette reminds me of like a
classy Crayola set probably my favorite
row in here is this second one with all
these army greens and browns this whole
corner actually I literally have no
words I have a couple different videos
using this palette the first one there
it goes again
the way this shade looks on your eyes if
you have green eyes holy-shit sees it
just makes them pop even on the lower
lashline it looks really pretty I like
doing that for just kind of everyday
looks where if I'm just putting like a
bronzer into my crease or something I'll
just pop this shade or this
on my lower lashline with a flat edged
brush and it really just makes your eyes
pop 24g is the other one I've been
reaching for a ton most of my shadows on
my eyes right now are from this palette
the kind of rose gold shade I have
underneath the silver from zodiac is
this shade and then I have just kind of
like a mix of different Browns and stuff
this shimmery white shade I have on my
inner corner these are so freakin
buttery and soft I love this camel Brown
shades the shimmer shades in here are
super soft gorgeous shades there's
something about these new palettes it
changes the packaging
by the way it's now this like soft
cardboard actually much prefer this
packaging to the old cheap plasticky
ones those ones did not feel good to use
like they didn't feel like great quality
these palettes have a nice weight to
them I like the bigger pan size I like
the packaging on the outside I feel like
they're just kind of stepping it up in
the formula has been spot-on whatever
they're doing with the new formula these
pallets is working they're beautiful
shadows alright I just have a few more
raves and we're gonna move on to rejects
to super quick red lip mentions that
I've been wearing pretty much any time
we want a red lip is the Ardell smoking
hot liquid lipstick I feel like I have
two cup and then the Physicians Formula
healthy lip in the shade red story of
effects I could add these two to my red
lipsticks top red lipsticks video that I
recently made I would because these are
both gorgeous formula wise and shade
wise this Ardell one is pretty close to
like the perfect red shade in my opinion
I get deep red and then the Physicians
Formula one is brighter but it has this
almost rosy tone to it the both these
take a minute to dry down they're not
instantly dry matte formulas which is
nice because they don't have that super
dry seal to them once they do dry down
on the bottom is our Dell on the top is
Physicians Formula the unique thing
about this physicians for a minute to me
is that it almost has a little bit of
rose in it it's like a bright red with a
hint of Rose both of these eventually
dry down matte they don't have a lot of
transfer to them they wear well
throughout the day with food and
everything they feel very comfortable on
the lips I love the applicator of the
Physicians Formula it has the triangle
applicator which I'm all about and it
almost feels like a thin gloss going on
is that moisturizing but then it does
dry down and lasts drive for the month
is shocking to me and probably to you
it's actually from the wish app this is
the focal or eyebrow dip brow type of
product
I have the shade zero for ash brown I'm
wearing it right now and if I just want
to use something like a gel brow product
like a pomade there's the word I've been
reaching for this I really like the
shade of it I like that it doesn't have
too much it glide to it I like my
eyebrow products to have a tiny bit of
tug just so you don't get too bold of a
brow really quickly you have a little
bit of room to work with it and that's
what this has it lasts all day I really
like it and it's kind of grown on me the
more I've used it and for a couple bucks
you can't go wrong let's now move on to
the rejects I have a whole bin here
number one is the L'Oreal infallible
glow lock illuminating base I did not
find this to be illuminating whatsoever
it just doesn't do a whole lot it looks
like a very sheer gel kind of
moisturizer almost it doesn't give you
that glow that you would expect from an
illuminating primer so don't think this
one is worth the money next up I have a
Physicians Formula reject and I actually
first tried this months ago maybe even
like a year ago because when I was in
the old office space is when I first
tried this in first impressions video
and the more I use this the more I
really don't like this it has this very
odd formula for a setting spray where
you spray it and it dries almost
instantly not in a good way it almost
like makes my skin more dry and every
single time I try it the more I don't
like it there's something very odd about
the formula this I don't know if there's
like a shit-ton of alcohol in this or
something but that's the way it feels it
almost feels like that drying alcohol
kind of situation
this is the new Becca under eye primer I
think this is new they say like a hard
bomb it almost feels like a lip balm it
just really does a whole lot of nothing
it doesn't feel quite hydrating enough
for the under eyes it almost feels like
a bomb primer that you would use on like
your t-zone it feels and looks pretty
cheap to me I don't feel like this makes
my under eye concealer crease any less I
don't feel like it really adds a whole
lot of moisture under there I just
really don't think this is worth the
money I just concealer works really well
for some people on my skin it looks not
great don't think it's worth the money
this is the Estee Lauder Double Wear
stay in place concealer at the lightest
shade which is one n it is very yellow I
find that it just kind of like slides
around
give me the coverage that I like under
my eyes I don't think this is a
full-coverage concealer it doesn't
really cover my darkness all the way
doesn't cover my freckles under there it
just feels a little bit too creamy to
the point where it's almost kind of hard
to set and when I do put a powder on top
of it it just kind of looks too heavy
and cakey because of the consistency of
the concealer underneath the powder so
this one I'm not feeling at all
so hourglass came out with two new brow
products one of them I absolutely love
and I've been using almost every day
when I'm not using the focal or product
but I didn't want to mention this
because I don't feel like it's something
that you particularly need to buy for
the price I just feel like there are
other options so I do like this but the
product that I don't like is the arch
brow illuminizer
gel when our brands gonna stop making
brow gel applicators giant it doesn't
make sense the wand on here is pretty
much like a mascara wand it's just
chopped in half so it's shorter way to
friggin big to get on your brow without
it getting outside of your brow and on
your face project is called brow
luminizing fiber gel and when I think of
luminizing fiber I think of something
like the benefit gimme brow which
actually does somehow add volume in like
hairs to your brows this doesn't do that
at all I don't find it to add any type
of volume and it almost gives you this
like shiny effect to your brows this
next one is a product that I recently
did a foundation Friday on it's the
first day beauty hello fab triple
protection skin tint for whatever reason
this looks horrible on my skin I've
tried to use it again since that video
just to see and it just sits on my skin
so bad it looks like I have a powder on
for something that is supposed to be
very natural and just a tint of color it
just looks bad on my skin definitely not
worth the 30 bucks or whatever this was
32 something on there this product I'm
just confused by it seems almost
counterintuitive to me this is a milk
makeup luminous blur stick essentially
this is supposed to be kind of like
their first blur stick a blurring
product but this actually has a glow to
it the areas where you would want to
blur out are where your pores our most
prominent which on most people I feel
like is around their nose on their chin
maybe on their forehead that's typically
where you'd want to use like a blurring
product so I don't know why you would
want any of these areas to be luminous I
don't find the original blur sticks to
be super blurring I don't find this one
to be super blurring also interesting
because they say that you can use this
place of a foundation you get a very
very sheer color with this it has a gold
tint to it but there is no kind of real
pigment in there that's it blend it out
I mean you can't even see it in my skin
I don't know I feel like something
missed the mark here either between the
way they have communicated this product
or the actual product I don't know it
just doesn't the dots don't connect for
me on this one the CYO eyeliner marker
pen this is the three and easy is what
it's called have these three prongs here
this looks like a friggin dull fork or
something it just is kind of gimmicky
kind of unnecessary the actual product
too is not the most black I would just
say pass on this one
I did a whole video testing out CYO
makeup that's where I discovered the
lifeproof foundation in that video so
that is everything by the way on my lips
right now I'm wearing the healthy lip
assistance formula in all natural nude
then I topped it off with the CYO lip
gloss and your best side just to give it
a little bit more pink I think all the
rest of the makeup I told you guys what
I was wearing so hope you guys enjoyed
it raisin rejects if you did don't
forget to give this a thumbs up let me
know in the comments what your favorite
products of the month has been past
compliments whatever you've been feeling
lately I love you guys I hope you're
getting excited for 15 days foundation
and I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
