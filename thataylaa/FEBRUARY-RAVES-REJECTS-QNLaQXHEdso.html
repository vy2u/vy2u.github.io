race and rejects I'm pretty sure I just
filmed my January race and rejects like
a week ago but we're back actually have
a lot of stuff right here and I have it
all organized in the little basket for
one since they've just all over my desk
I'm sitting farther back due to popular
demand I can't see if I'm in focus I'm
in the process of selling this camera
I'm getting the Canon t5i so that I
don't have to deal with the focusing
stuff it just takes a ridiculous amount
of time so yeah I'm just gonna hope I'm
in focus right now I did not film a
tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now because I didn't know it was
happening I just kind of got ready to
film and then the dramatic smoky eye
happened I will however have all the
makeup details on my blog I don't think
I've ever even announced it on here but
I do have like a technically a blog I
don't frequently post to it but my new
year's goal was to push on there once a
month which I have done so far so go
together or whatever like that I do have
a blog and I'll be posting all the
makeup details of what I'm wearing on my
face right now over on the blog it's
just the same as my youtube channel the
tailor calm and I'll leave the direct
link down below
alright brain stop talking and just show
you what I'm into this month I've been
obsessed with a new foundation
combination this month I feel like
there's a new one every month but
foundation is like what gets me going I
really like trying different foundations
and I just get bored of them really
quick whenever I mentioned a new
combination or foundation doesn't mean
that I don't like the old ones I just
like to play around and try different
stuff on my skin so to hold a new
routine the primary been using is cover
FX mattifying primer - deluxe sample
size from Sephora they just throw it in
sometimes when you order stuff this has
anti acne treatment in it which caught
my eye and it has salicylic acid so I
thought that was awesome primer is one
of those things
can't really tell if it's breaking out
my face because of the silicone
knowledge it my skin has been getting
better I think it's due to a combination
of a few different products that I'll
show you but this might be one who knows
I do know that this definitely keeps me
up yeah yeah
it keeps me matte throughout the day and
it does help to minimize your pores and
just kind of keep you looking smooth I
purchased a couple different orders from
Sephora and I think I'm filming a haul
after this but everytime they found the
option to throw this in at checkout so I
have like three backup samples of this
which is awesome
the foundations I've been wearing on top
of that are the Estee Lauder Double Wear
in the shade 1c one shelf
no cool bone mixed with Revlon Colorstay
110 and ivory and I do use the combo
oily skin one I have no words for how
amazing this combination is together
this is the only combination that I
found that's full coverage and I don't
need to powder my face at all
I'm think I've ever not powdered in my
face this is the first time in my life
where I haven't had to powder and my
foundation looks flawless for nine to
ten hours the only big reason why I
started mixing in the Revlon Colorstay
was because this is a little bit too
dark for me I think they make a cooler
shape in this but it definitely is too
dark on its own so mixed in this is the
perfect shade for me mixed together but
it also just creates like the perfect
long-lasting consistency and I'm
obsessed with it by the foundation I've
just been using the Real Techniques
miracle complexion sponge and it's been
working well not what you say about a
sponge my favorite contour color this
month has been the Mac feel like I have
to go
favorite contour this month has been Mac
taupe blush blush actually picked this
up a while ago probably a few months ago
and I used it like here and there but I
didn't really use it religiously I don't
do a contour on daily basis just because
it's not something I feel like I need to
do at 6:00 in the morning when I get
ready for work but when I do wear a
contour it's this guy I have it on right
now I feel like it just creates nice
like natural definition this isn't a
bronzer so you don't
you putting this like all over your face
to warm it up this is definitely more
cool toned it'll just help to school
about your cheekbones and whatever else
you want sculpted doe by Degas this
Sedona lace FBO v brush this is my
favorite contour brush I mentioned it in
my how to highlight contour video it's
just perfectly dome shaped a little guy
and it just it's nice and keep bones
have two different blushes that I've
been wearing every single day this month
the first is the Tarte Amazonian clay
blush in the shade buff I don't know how
many times I try to say that I actually
got this off of glam but I think I might
have been in one of my clan buttholes
I kind of wanted to try something that
was a little more peachy and deep just
so I could use it as like kind of a
bronzer and a blush just to like warm up
my face super quickly in the morning
this is exactly that it does a great job
of just making me look more alive
without being a bronzer or without
having like a ton of color it is really
pigmented and I use a stippling brush to
apply it for that reason but these stay
on forever I think they're actually
supposed to be 12 hour
yeah 12 hour blushes obviously it
depends on the foundation you're wearing
underneath and the products that you
have underneath your blush but I find
that it stays on all day and I really
really like this the second blush I've
been wearing this month is milwaukee's
powder Rose blush what is this called
romantic rose 0-1 this is so freakin
pretty does it say ultra silky soft
powder blush that easily blends into the
cheeks it definitely feels super soft
even when you swatch it on your finger
it's like just feels like super soft and
nice it definitely does blend in really
nice this is again kind of like a deeper
shade which I usually go for like super
babydoll pink blushes I don't know I've
just been feeling the mob's lately they
know they have a bunch of different
shades in this let me know what your
favorite shades are because come on and
pick up a couple more I'm even more
blush I discovered a new eyelash glue
this month is the kiss strip lash
adhesive is supposed to last for 24
hours you want to wear false lashes for
24 hours the thing I really like about
this glue is the brush has a silicone
wand and it's just super easy to apply
on the lashes
like brush on kind of things and this is
just great your lashes aren't going
anywhere it's easy to apply it dries
fairly fast don't think it's like a
super fast drying glue doesn't burn my
eyes and I'm usually because it's late
x-ray so if you're allergic to latex
this one is latex free you're in the
market for a new lash glue Transco I
still have more makeup stuff but I just
wanted to mention this guy this is
definitely been a favorite this month
this is the Bombay hair flattering I
don't think I've ever mentioned the hair
tool on my channel just because I've
been using the same straightener for
literally three years it's like a twenty
dollar Target Remington straightener the
thing I love about this is that it is so
easy to curl your hair with I don't use
a curling iron
I hate hair I can't do a hair I just
like the things that are quick and easy
and tell me curl my hair every single
day this is like leftover from a couple
days ago I mentioned it in the vlog
again if you want to see like a before
and after but this is just so easy to
curl your hair with a straight iron the
one thing that I do want to mention if
you're thinking about purchasing one of
these is that the plastic right here on
the sides is starting to peel off and I
contacted Bombay asking them like what
was up with that and she said that it
was normal and that happened so I
thought that was kind of strange I feel
like you should just fix that if there's
clearly an issue with it so yeah if you
don't have an issue with the plastic
peeling off then it's a great
straightener but else I feel like you
should know that if you're gonna spend
your hard-earned money on it
my next rave is the bioderma sensibio
h2o like cleansing water or whatever
this is called
I don't believe you can find this in the
US I've only heard like Australian
youtubers talk about this but this is a
makeup remover I have never been a fan
of liquid eye makeup removers because
they're usually oil-based and I hate
that oily residue I'm kind of like
straight away from my Neutrogena wipes
lately and I've been using the Garnier
cleansing lotion that I talked about at
my last race in redress
and then for my eyes I just put a tiny
bit of this on a cotton pad and it
literally takes off all of my eye makeup
and the thing I really like is that
there is no residue at all it just feels
like you have like clean skin I've also
gone in with this and used it kind of as
a toner after I've washed my face and it
does still bring like makeup and stuff
off that I thought was not on my face so
that's good to know and also kind of
frightening I got this stuff off of ebay
because it was cheaper I know they also
have it on Amazon I'll leave both the
links down below if you want to check it
out yourself another kind of skincare
product to mention this month and this
is the studio 35 alpha-hydroxy face
cream this is from Walgreens it's like
eight bucks and it's a aah a solution so
AJ creams are supposed to reduce
wrinkles and signs of aging they're also
used in chemical peels most koreans
contain around 4% this is 8% AJ so it's
obviously a little bit stronger than the
average cream first of all shout out to
my friend Christie Robbie to Christie
because she is the one that I found this
from this the smell smells kind of like
chemically I don't think this is
something that you would want to wear
under your foundation just because it is
pretty thick but if you like that like
intense thick luxurious kind of night
cream where you just lather it on and
let it absorb into your skin overnight
this is perfect I don't know what it is
but when I wake up the next morning my
skin just feels so like plump and just
so much better I like look forward to
taking off my makeup at night just so I
can put this stuff on my face again my
acne has been significantly going down I
don't know you guys can tell it was it
more inclination but it has been going
down and I don't know if it's because of
this or the primer I don't know but
whatever I'm doing right now I think is
working I'm really enjoying this stuff
and if you're in the market for a good
night moisturizer check it out alright
last two things I feel like guys just
talked for like a half-hour last two
things I have are these Jordana modern
matte lipsticks the two that I'm
obsessed
with our matte blush and matt baer I'll
swatch it for you guys
these are super moisturizing they look
matte but they just sit really nicely on
the lips they don't settle into fine
lines or anything they're about as long
lasting as the Milani matte lipsticks
that I did a whole video on so here's
the two next to each other matte blush
is the lighter one without this cool ya
matte blush is the lighter one this is
one that I wear more frequently to work
I also really like this one just the
tone of these and everything are perfect
they smell like cake and wax when you go
to Walgreens to pick up the face cream
get you some protein lipsticks alright
so that was everything if you guys like
this video and you like rates and
rejects videos give it a thumbs up so I
know comment down below with what your
favorite products of February wear
because I want to know I didn't want to
mention really quick that I've been a
little bit off of my filming game lately
work has been insane and on the weekend
I've just I need a break
so I'm trying my best to get two videos
a week up for you guys like usual I've
been kind of on one video a week lately
but I'm going to get back to two so
thank you for being patient yeah it's
all I want to say I love you guys thanks
for watching and see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
