all right so today we have February
rates and rejects also my favorite
products from January because I didn't
make a January race and rejects video
this month this past month I think this
video will actually be up the day I get
to San Diego I'm gonna be in San Diego
on March 4th make sure you follow me on
Twitter because I think I might do like
a low-key meet-up slash hangout so if
you're in the San Diego area and you
want to hang follow me on Twitter and
snapchat that's where I would announce a
hangout if it's happening so if you're
new to my channel I don't take raves and
rejects videos lightly these are
products that are tried and tested set
the thing yeah these are products that
I've been trying out for a while now and
that I absolutely love they don't make
it in a race and rejects video if I
don't think that you should buy them
before we hop in cuz I have a ton
of stuff I did finally film a short hair
curly hair routine video that'll
probably be up after this video be on
the lookout for that
alright let's just do this so the first
thing I want to mention which is my like
if you could buy one thing out of this
whole video buy this this is the cover
effects illuminating Center six let's
talk illuminating setting powder and
this is in the shade light I got this
from glam but you can see the glam out
sticker there if you don't know glam
bonds where you can buy high-end use
makeup for super cheap I'll link it down
below if you haven't checked it out yet
but I think I got this for like half off
and there was still a ton of product in
here when I got it I'm wearing this
right now this is basically a setting
powder that leaves your skin looking so
beautiful the finish of this is I
wouldn't say this is like a glowy
setting powder like it doesn't look like
the it cosmetics celebration foundation
elimination doesn't give you that much
glow also could they have made that name
like any longer it doesn't give you that
kind of glow it gives your skin just the
right amount of Sheen where it doesn't
look like you're wearing a setting
powder it just looks like your skin like
you can see it reflecting off my
forehead a little bit but it doesn't
look overly dewy my skin has this weird
thing with loose setting powders where
any loose setting powder I've ever tried
whether it's translucent or not leaves
my skin looking super patchy it like
takes away some of the coverage it just
doesn't make my foundation
good at all I usually stay away from
loose setting powders for that reason
and I don't know why I just randomly
decided to try this but I'm so happy I
did the color is perfect if you have
pale skin it gives you a tiny bit of
color but it's not too dark it's the
perfect tone for me gives you a tiny
tiny bit of coverage which I really like
so I feel like it's not taking away from
the coverage and when I put this on it
just makes my whole face look like
together and the brush I used to apply
that is actually this brush which looks
like a liquid foundation brush but I've
been using it to apply this powder and
it is amazing this is the Coastal Scents
VR 110 brush I think this is like $5 or
$4 something insane like that I linked
all the products in the description box
always so if you have any questions you
should check their first since it is a
little bit more dense for a powder brush
it gives you really nice coverage and I
literally just Pat this on love using
this brush to apply this powder you need
both of these next is another powder for
your face this is the stargazer powder
use this in one of my recent shadow news
videos and this is basically just a
pressed white powder I tried a lot of
pressed white powders that are like
literally white powders this one is my
favorite it doesn't give you that like
chalky white look I should probably co
to use this for I used to set my under
eyes and that's what I'm wearing right
now I've been using this over my
Physicians Formula powder lately I do
think both of them are amazing
I've just been reaching for this one
more lately I feel like I'm about to hit
panic I can see it coming i concealer
looks good all day with this powder I
want to say this is like the softest
powder in the world but it doesn't have
that trockie finish which is super rare
to find an appear stark white powder
only recommending this if you have pale
skin if you don't this will probably
look way too light on you but if you're
someone who has a really hard time
making your under eyes look bright
because every powder is too dark try
this out it is literally five dollars on
Amazon you can't go wrong okay I
actually have a ton of face products
this month this is the collection
lasting perfection 16 hour concealer in
the shade fair and I got this off of
ebay I mentioned this and that lash out
on schmooze too and I said it was Rimmel
this isn't Rimmel I don't know why I
think it's because the packaging looks
exactly
like normal to mean you think their font
is like exactly the same what is
collection if you guys are in the UK let
me know what collection is this is such
a great concealer I've been reaching for
this over my Urban Decay Naked concealer
I think it's just because I like the
color of this a little bit better it's a
little more pink toned which I really
like for my under eye full coverage
really nice consistency it's creamy but
not as creamy as the Urban Decay Naked
skin and I just really like the way that
it sets it doesn't crease on me it
actually creases less than the Urban
Decay Naked skin for me another face
product this is the elf illuminating
palette I was not expecting to like as
much as I do
I think they might have two different
shades of this so make sure you get the
lightest one if your my skin tone it's
super powdery so I feel like I'm gonna
like pour out powder when I do this but
there's four different shades in here
this is the powder that I use most
frequently is what I'm wearing today as
a highlight I've been using this every
single day I don't know what it is about
this I think the color of this the shade
it has a little bit of yellow to it so
it just makes your cheekbones and your
under eyes look super highlighted
there's something about this shade that
is so flattering on pale skin I think
this is six dollars on elfs website you
can probably find you target two in this
shade I've actually been using to
contour it has a little bit of shimmer
in it so not ideal but it does work and
if you have pale skin like look at that
that is like the perfect light light
contour shade like if you're looking for
something supernatural if you want a
little bit more of a bronzey look you
can even mix these two shades I will say
that the consistency of these pretty
powdery when you apply this like you
definitely get some powder flying up for
me I can overlook that because I love
the shade of it and just the way that it
makes my cheekbones look but keep that
in mind if you're not someone who likes
super powdery products you probably
won't like this but for me I'm feeling
it okay the next thing I feel like I
have to mention because this is such an
underrated incredible product that I
feel like deserves so much more
recognition than it gets these are the
pure cosmetics I polishes and I've used
these multiple times in different videos
I've never actually mentioned them as
like a favorite but these are awesome
this is in the shade caviar this is one
of my favorites it's like this green
black gold shade super unique so
basically what these are is potted
liquid products that dry to a powder
finish they give you the most
seyn shimmer but you don't get any of
that fallout that you usually get from
shadows has this mesh thing right here
so you basically just tap it but this is
what it looks like I'm gonna swatch it
super shimmery it has a little bit of
glitter in it but you don't get any
fallout at all the market these is like
primers and top coats but you could
literally use this however you wanted to
you put these all over the lid and just
put a color in your crease and be good
to go you could use these on top of
something few different shades of these
but I think caviar and silk are my
favorites this is like a copper super
pretty look at that okay next I have to
mention this because this has literally
been saving my skin the past month I
finally got this so many of you guys
have told me to get this over like the
last year it's basically a loose powder
mask and you have to mix it with either
water or apple cider vinegar I've been
using it about three times a week you
can use it every day you can use it
every other day this is basically like a
miracle mask this is the Aztec secret
Indian healing clay you can get it on
Amazon it comes in this huge-ass jar but
I've been doing is mixing it in a
plastic bowl with a plastic knife you
don't want to use metal with this it
says no pour in apple cider vinegar
which is really great for acne it's like
a natural astringent and mix it together
and then you apply it as a face mask I
leave it on for about an hour thirty
minutes to an hour it like massively
tightens and you can't talk at all when
you wash off your face the first time I
use this I thought I had like a reaction
to it because my face was so red I did
some research and that's what it's
supposed to happen it's totally fine and
then when you wake up the next morning
my acne has shrunk my skin just looks I
don't even know how to describe it you
got to try this for yourself it's like
nine dollars on Amazon my skin has been
horrible the past few months don't know
what's happening I'm gonna be going back
to my dermatologist but this has been
helping to like keep it at bay in the
meantime the ones down here and on my
chin have been going down still getting
acne but the sexy like has definitely
helped next product is a conditioner and
this is the sugar at schools hair
conditioner sweet cotton candy scent
which normally doesn't appeal to me at
all I usually don't like this super
super sweet sense but this smells so
 good so this is from a seller on
Etsy actually heard of her because
of Kendall rage to mention these in a
favorites video leaves my hair feeling
so soft smells amazing it's one of those
conditioners that sense stays in your
hair and lingers which I really like
these products are handmade by a hair
stylist so she knows what she's doing
and she uses these products in her salon
and on her clients my labels like kind
of worn off and my bottle looks a little
janky but it's a great product if you're
in the market for a new shampoo and
conditioner this is the brilliant and
spellbinding a palette by Sigma quickly
had to give a shout out to this palette
because one of the shades in here in
particular I've been in love with this
is the brown shade right here it's
called sensational when I did the live
streaming on stroke we use this and I
mentioned this in another video I think
as well if you love these like crap
brown shades that are so ugly that
they're amazing
you'll love this it is pretty powdery so
you'll definitely want to use a primer
but look at that like oh it's like the
perfect camel brown shade you could use
this in the crease the outer corner all
over the lid the other shadows look
super pretty I haven't really dug into
them much I just like randomly open that
palette one day and saw that shade and
have been using it ever since
three more brushes I want to mention I'm
going to be doing a whole my favorite
brushes video coming very soon I know I
promised that like a month ago but it is
coming I did want to mention these three
brushes because I've been using these
like crazy the past couple months these
are all from Coastal Scents super
affordable Coastal Scents I think has
some really great brushes you just have
to it's like very hit-or-miss I think
half of the ones I've tried I really
like and would recommend and the other
half I wouldn't it really depends on the
ones that you get so this is the pr2 50
this is basically just like a blending
basically like a blending crease brush
this is like that crease brush that
every brand has except this one was two
dollars and fifty cents and it is soft
it does the job and it's great this is
the VRC s08 I'm going to be linking all
these down below so you don't like
remember these crazy numbers this is
basically just a smaller blending crease
brush if your blending out a darker
shade in your outer beef this is the
perfect brush because it's small enough
to get right where you want it but it
still blends out the product and then
the last one is this brush PRCs
20 and basically I use this to pack on
shadow on the lid I use this today it's
great for dry shadow
it's great for wet shadows you guys know
I've used my finger for years to apply
my lid shade because I just haven't
found a brush that does as good of a job
as my finger and gives off as much
pigmentation this one is pretty dang
close I've actually been reaching for
this over using my finger so an x-ray
vis this Ulta Matan prime this is a
primer I don't think this helps making
your skin look more matte but if you
want a damn good smoothing primer that's
from the drugstore try this out it's
basically like a silicone consistency
primer but it's not as heavy as some of
the other silicone primers it blends in
so easily and just gives your skin this
like super soft foundation looks
beautiful on top of it is this on top of
my Nivea post shave balm and it's like a
match made in heaven
so last few products this is the e salon
get heated thermal protection hair mist
I've been using this as my heat
protectant if you missed it I did a
whole video recently on my short hair
and how I color my hair and kind of
products I use and I mention this in
that video it smells so freakin good
this literally smells like a perfume you
apply this in damp hair spray it all
over and I just brush it through and
like let it sit for a sec really been
liking this smells amazing ok we have
been talking for 25 minutes this is
gonna be a freakin long video so now I'm
going into the rejects I feel like I had
a ridiculous amount of rejects this
month I think just because I was trying
so many new products from the drugstore
these past couple months that there's
just a lot of stuff that I wasn't like
in the first one is this Maybelline
Dream velvet foundation this is like so
highly raved about from some people some
people hate it seems like one of those
products that it really depends on your
skin and the kind of coverage that
you're going for for me this did not
work at all
I've tried 0 5 and 10 both of them are
too dark and super Orange besides the
color there's something about this
foundation that I just hate like I said
some people this looks absolutely
beautiful on the finish in like the way
that it sits on my skin it really looks
heavy like it looks super cakey on me
and I know that's like opposite of how
it looks on some people but just on my
skin it does not work let me know if you
guys still want to see a full review on
this and like demo so you can see how it
looks on my skin but just tell me off
the bat like not a
this next reject is the wet-and-wild
photo focus lash primer I really liked
this the first couple weeks I was using
it I was putting this on as a lash
primer before my Too Faced better than
sex mascara and it's basically just a
white black primer supposed to help your
lashes look longer strengthen them make
your mascara going better and I felt
like it was working for me for the first
couple weeks and then I looked in the
mirror one night and I was like where in
the hell are all my lashes I feel like
this literally had been slowly
destroying my lashes I didn't change my
mascara at all my lashes just looked
like super weak in short I stopped using
this over the past couple weeks my
lashes are back to how they usually are
this is the only thing I changed
think it was this I don't know wasn't a
ban next product is the Milani baked
blush in Luminoso this is another like
cult favorite product the blush itself
is beautiful like the actual consistency
and I would use this on other people for
me this shade just looks horrible it's
like straight-up orange on my skintone I
think this would look beautiful if you
have more of a deeper complexion fair
pale princess don't try this out it's
straight up orange doesn't even look
peach it's like you put orange powder on
your face my last rejecter of the month
which I don't have because they actually
returned is the Loreal of magic Lumi
cushion foundation and the Physicians
Formula cushion foundation so I returned
both of those they're both way too dark
for me I have reviews on both of those
products first impression videos so link
both those reviews down below so you can
see in depth why I don't like them
alright so that was everything I feel
like that was a super long video if you
stuck around till now thank you
love you guys thanks for watching and
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
