video
all right so today it is my first normal
video after 15 days Foundation has ended
the wrap-up video where I rank all the
foundations is still come in on April
9th but I figured I would do my normal
three videos a week leading up to April
9th so you guys still have videos to
watch so today we're trying out a brand
new product from Becca ever since this
launched I picked it up on Sephora I've
been so curious about this I think I got
it during the middle of 15 days of
foundation and it has been so hard to
resist putting this bad boy on my face
this is the hydra mist set and refresh
powder and make this intro super brief
we're just gonna go over the basic
points of this product and then get into
putting it on and i am doing a full day
wear test in this video and flash tests
so this powder retails for $38 and you
get 0.35 ounces of product so that's a
freaking pricey powder to give you some
comparison the cover effects
illuminating setting powder also has
0.35 ounces of product but the
Maybelline fit me loose powder these two
are some of my favorite loose powders by
the way this one has 0.7 ounces of
product it actually has double the
amount of powder that both of these ones
have and this is drugstore so the
interesting thing about this powder if
you haven't seen or heard anything about
it that it's supposed to have a mist
like sensation on the skin so it's
supposed to feel almost like wet
basically it has 50% water and glycerin
in it supposed to give you a seamless
finish in a comfortable feel sets and
refreshes makeup for a silky smooth
invisible finish smooth and blur fine
lines and imperfections if you're
excited for this video don't forget to
give it a thumbs up if you're new here
you can join the baby rito family and
subscribe I upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time
just a reminder we're still shooting to
raise $20,000 for project Beauty share
the shop is open until the 9th the
wrap-up video goes up the link will be
down below alright so we are gonna be
doing a wear test today so we can see
how the pad wears throughout the day so
it's 11:30 right now and I've already
put on my foundation and my under-eye
concealer so I am trying the foundations
from 15 days of foundation for the
wrap-up video right now which you guys
will be seeing on April 9th but I have
tried this combo before with the Sephora
micro smooth powder so I know how or
with that one so I'm using the CL
lifeproof in 101 mixed with the flower
beauty light illusion and the lightest
shade l-1 and then my concealer which is
already creasing because I've been
talking and haven't set this yet but
what I've been doing is putting just a
dab of Tarte shape tape
right at the beginning of my undereye
what I'm trying to say right towards the
inner corner and then I'll go into laura
mercier flawless fusion in the shade 1/n
and i'll use this for concealing the
rest of my under eye this has about
medium coverage it's not full coverage
but the finish of it and the way that it
sets with powders that I have been using
I've been using a mix of my Physicians
Formula powder in the darker shade mixed
with the wish app powder that I used in
that video and this combo with those
powders have been just working really
well for me and my under eyes have been
like kind of funky lately I'm so excited
about this thing on the back that says
set and chill it looks like there is not
a lot of powder in here at all
I don't know why they would make the
packaging like that because it just
looks like it's half empty it looks like
it has a little kind of pink salmon tint
to it I recently made a whole video on
my favorite powder is to set foundation
with so I'll link that anion down below
but in that video I talked a little bit
about how my skin is super weird with
powders typically loose powders and my
skin do not mix well whether it's for
setting under-eye concealer or for
setting my whole face I do have a couple
that I like that are in that video but
for the most part it usually just kind
of removes any of the coverage it just
makes my skin look not great at all so
I'm kind of hesitant about this one but
we'll see how it is I was kind of going
back and forth whether or not I wanted
to set my under eyes with this powder or
use my normal powders but since we are
testing this product we'll see how it
does on the under eyes keep in mind 99%
of loose powders on my skin don't work
especially on my under eyes so if this
was like the average person's skin
giving this powder a fair shot someone
who can use like you know the Cody
airspun loose powders whatever can bake
I'm like way down here I cannot bake
baking looks horrible on my under eyes
so just keep in mind I'm like coming at
it down here with just how my skin
reacts to loose powders I still want to
try this and I feel like there are a lot
of you out there who also have the same
issues so maybe if that's you this will
help you out or not we'll see so I'm
gonna smooth out this crease that's
already starting before I go in an
attempt to set my under eyes my
concealer and stuff has been on for just
a couple minutes so far just since I've
been talking I'm not gonna use a sponge
I'm not gonna bake because if I'm giving
my under eyes any kind of fair shot with
the loose powder the best way that I
find to apply it for myself under my
eyes is with a dense brush like this
this is a Smashbox full coverage
foundation brush it's actually a
foundation brush but this is usually
what I use
for my undereyes I also have an elf when
I use which I'll link down below and
then more recently like in the past
couple weeks I've been using the BH
Cosmetics 137 and I like this one
because it's a little bit smaller so
it's really great for setting the under
eyes but it's still very firm so I still
get that covered and I don't feel like
it removes as much of the concealer if I
go in with any kind of more loose brush
or like a fluffy brush for the under the
eyes does not work with my skin give it
a fair shot I think I'm gonna use the BH
Cosmetics 137 because this is what I've
been using almost every day the past
couple weeks this whole thing flips up
and then you remove this part oh it's
like a little mesh thing this looks like
the Tarte foundation powder that I have
a whole review one I believe yeah like
an old one just zoomed in a tiny bit
more so hopefully you guys can see up
close and personal I need to pluck my
eyebrows I just wrapped up with 15 days
of foundation got back in from San
Francisco last night so I'm a little bit
all over the place right now don't mind
the brows so I'm just gonna go ahead dip
my brush into this little mesh thingy
kind of tap it off a little bit so I
have the powder on the brush I'm so
curious okay here we go
oh whoa okay wow I have lots lots of
thoughts right now my undereyes feel wet
and it just darkened my under eyes oh my
god at least like three shades I hope
that's showing up on camera I hope that
doesn't happen to the rest of my face
because that literally just Wow
completely dark in my under eyes I don't
think I've ever had
a powder dark in it that much and then
what's happening here
it's almost turning lighter right here
and apart it feels like it's kind of I
guess it does feel a little bit tight
yeah looking pretty horrible underneath
my eyes okay so I definitely would not
use this underneath my eyes frigging
dark under there I think just so I can
get like the same look on both eyes I am
going to do it on the other side and
then I'm gonna go in with a lighter
powder over top to bright and everything
probably after I do the rest of my face
it is so bizarre II it feels like you're
putting water or like lotion on under
there or something it feels very wet wow
it's like darkening by the second okay
yeah you can definitely feel it
it almost feels like when I did the
video on the weird hot look products
that under-eye lifting and thing it
almost feels like that where I can like
definitely feel it tight a bit under my
eyes this one looks a lot better than
this side though this one's still darken
though so I definitely would not use
this as an under-eye powder like ever
again I'm just gonna hope that when I
put this on the rest of my face it
doesn't dark into that color but I'm
gonna do the powder for my full face and
then I'm gonna go in like I said when
he's like a brightening powder under
there because off the bat there's no
point like isolating a wear test for
underneath my eyes because I would not
put this under my eyes Wow so I guess to
get this in the mesh thing you have to
close it again and then flip it over and
then open it which I actually like
better then yeah that's way nicer than
having to like tap it into the lid or
something like you normally do with
loose powders so whether I use loose
setting powder pressed powder I always
use a firm powder brush like this again
I talked about why in that video so I'm
not gonna go into it here but this just
always apply as part of the best on my
skin I don't blend I can't use like a
big fluffy brush most often and the best
application for me is just pressing the
powder into my skin making sure it's all
blended and not going like this so the
foundation doesn't like rub off
underneath so that's just what works
best for my skin this is the for less
cb4 brush i'll have everything linked
down below here we go folks
round 2 oh my gosh it feels even weirder
on your face it feels so freakin wet
this feels wrong this feels like a
makeup no no right now very natural Matt
doesn't look like I have a super matte
like powder caked on it does seem to be
one of those powders that takes away the
coverage of my foundation though you can
see a lot more coming through on this
side then on this side it did seem to
kind of take away some of that
foundation underneath again that's
pretty classic for me as far as the
shade looking at this area not up here
cuz that's what already darkened I do
think the powder did darken my face too
not as bad as underneath my eyes but I
would say it darkened about at least a
shade yeah the finish on my dry skin
though doesn't look too bad for being
like a matte powder but I feel like
because of the whole hydro mist water
thing they have going
I would kind of expect it to be a little
bit do you're going on this side it
feels so weird dude I literally feel
like I'm stamping like setting spray
onto my face it's kind of exciting like
when do you feel a new sensation on your
face with makeup you know like I feel
like everything has kind of been done in
that department but then here we go
with Becca this is wild I can feel kind
of like the tightening happening my face
feels pretty dry right now my under eyes
first sure like especially this one
feels hella dry definitely darkened now
my face is much darker than my chest
down a little bit
seems to be emphasizing my texture more
on this side it's clinging a little bit
to some like dryness and it doesn't look
quite as smooth as this side almost
looks a little bit patchy ooh I'm scared
for my forehead for this one so far the
only thing I'm liking about this is the
like initial sensation of actually
putting it on your face here we go oh my
god feels so weird
yeah it pretty much like instantly
darkens I mean oh look in the rough
what's going on right there right
between my eyebrows it is not looking
good it's doing some weird cleaning
there I have a few like whiteheads or
something right here I think from I
think it was from the Maybelline fit me
foundation I can't tell if it's that or
the Becca aqua luminous I'm really
hoping it's not the Becca aqua luminous
because if you saw de 15 you know how I
feel about that one but I am getting
like a little bit of whiteheads or
something from that but on this area
where I have those and I have more
texture right on the center of my
forehead it does not look good at all
this is a little bit worse than I was
anticipating not only did it remove my
coverage like I said classic problem
with me with powders but it also
darkened and it is cleaning certain
areas and I have no idea what's
happening underneath my eyes and on my
forehead it also looks like shit sees so
what I'm gonna do is brighten up my
under eyes a little bit because we
already know it's a no-go for sure
underneath my eyes I mean I would not
use this again myself on the rest of my
face but for the sake of the video we'll
do a wear test to see how it goes so
what I'm doing is I just mix a little
bit of the may cheer white powder this
has like a very light white brightening
kind of effect and I mix in some of the
Physicians Formula powder but because my
face is so dark right now I don't want
to mix this too light so I'm probably
just gonna basically use the Physicians
Formula one which also sits really
nicely underneath my eyes so let's just
set this brighten it up there you can
already see how much more lift at this
side looks then this side it look like
dead obviously my under eyes are gonna
look pretty shitty today because I'm
just brightening it at this point it's
not gonna make them look any better
because of that
powder underneath it Wow alright I'm
gonna get real up close so here you can
see all the weirdness happening right
here clinging on to everything also
looks a little bit patchy and odd you
see it clinging down here just does not
look the best but here's a little
close-up oh shit
HQ is on does anyone else straight-up
addicted to the HQ app it doesn't make
it past like the third question every
time it's right now it's 1156 I'm going
to do the rest my makeup
and I will be back it is now 12:40 but
the check-in time is twelve o'clock now
that the rest of my makeup is on I don't
feel like it looks as noticeably
horrible but I wouldn't say I would look
at my skin right now and think it looks
good
exactly the same as my thoughts
previously for being 50% water I feel
like my skin feels hello dry right now
you definitely feel that obviously when
it first goes on because you get that
really cool sensation that does feel
like you're putting water on your face
but now that it's like set on my face it
feels super set like I definitely can't
feel any kind of stickiness or tackiness
my face is fully set and matte but my
skin just feeling it as I'm talking
feels very dry so we'll see how this
works throughout the day but if you have
dry skin this one I think is a no at
this point whether your skin type is
oily dry whatever if you have any kind
of weird powder problems like I do if
you have more textured skin or if you
have any kind of dry patches stuff to
cover up whatever if you have the same
kind of loose powder problems that I do
this is a major no-go for me I would not
wear this again the only thing I like
about this product I keep feeling fergan
lashes stick together or something the
only thing I like about this at this
point is just that cooling sensation
when you first get if they use that same
sensation and turned it into like a
liquid foundation or pressed powder or
something I think I probably hopefully
liked that a lot more but this is loose
powder for me is a major thumbs down at
this point keep in mind this is my skin
I'm sure if you're someone who can wear
loose powders and doesn't have the same
powder issues that I do this will
probably look totally different on your
skin I tried to kind of bring the powder
down on my neck so I don't think the
shade difference is as noticeable I
don't think I've seen that drastic of
darkening that quickly with the powder
before cool idea not loving the actual
product at all but check-in time is 12
o'clock
just because this is a loose powder
let's see how this does in flash so
here's a little flash test there's not a
whole lot of natural light coming
through right now we're having like a
totally gray day in Seattle right now
but here's a little shot what it looks
like a natural light the shade is not
even showing up let me try and like back
up here it looks different in real life
but let me show you them dinh so
hopefully you can see what I'm seeing it
almost looks like splotchy and just like
clinging weird and then
here's the rest of my face again the
rest my face doesn't look horrible I
just would not reach for this again bye
let's go ahead and do a flash test whoa
major flashback considering it's
actually a few shades darker than my
neck in real life this looks a few
shades lighter than my neck so this has
like major major bounce back I would not
recommend wearing this one in flash
photography so for the rest of my face
for this blue shade I use the Sedona
lace what is this actually called I
don't know what this is called there's
no name on it I use this bright blue
shade right there on my lid then I use
the Milani most loved mattes palette for
all of my matte shadows which I am
obsessed with these blend outs so easy
bronzer you said tarte don't be afraid
to dazzle shade right here smells so
good
highlight is the mac hyper-real glow i
just go in with this lightest shade
right here which has gotten its use out
of it so far same shade I used as a face
highlight is also what's on the inner
corner of my eyes lashes I use the Isle
or 120 ones literally through these
products everywhere words I go for lips
I used open decay first sin and it was a
little bit too like bright orange e for
what I was going for so then I toned it
down with the Maybelline teased vivid
lacquer which literally disappeared and
then for blush I use the Maybelline fit
me blush in the shade 35 so it's now 436
so it's been on for four and a half
hours I have been doing taxes since I
last saw you guys or not hours that time
of the year if you're a freelancer you
know this is the most fun time of the
year ever so I feel like my face is
looking even more orange now it's
looking very splotchy like especially on
my forehead which I know is happening
earlier but I feel like even more so
it's like a little bit more noticeable
now I'm getting a little bit of creasing
around my mouth area but I wouldn't say
it's worse than usual but it is there so
I'll see you guys in a few more hours at
the end of the night okay right now it's
912 so it's been on for a little over 9
hours
I shit you not I just wrapped up taxes
so this is one of those that I just
don't think it's gonna be for everyone
again if you have any kind of similar
situation to my skin type then you might
have a similar experience to what I did
but if you have no problem with that
then just keep in mind the darkening
thing
not one that I would reach for ever
again but I'm glad I tried it glad I now
know it almost looks like chalky up
close a little bit I'm gonna zoom in
whoo yeah
emphasizing kind of my lines up here and
stuff you can wear this lip dryness
after only half when you guys are seeing
this I think I'll be about 12 days left
on accutane which is wild you can
definitely see the color better in here
this is what it looks like all day it is
a really cool sensation the whole like
cooling things so I don't know if you
can get a sample of this from Sephora
they can just like tap some out in a
little sample jar for you but if you
can't get a sample I would because it's
just such a like unique experience it's
an experience it's not just a product
it's like it's an experience I hope you

thumbs-up if you're new here don't
