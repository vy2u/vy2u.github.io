legs are gonna be nice and poreless
alright so today it's day 13 of 15 days
of foundations where I try out a new
foundation every single day for 15 days
it's coming to an end we only have two
more days so make sure you check the
description box there's a playlist that
has days 1 through 12 in it it just so
happened that a very exciting launch
dropped right during this series so this
is the Fenty beauty by Rihanna
foundation this is the pro filter soft
matte long wear foundation this
foundation retails for $34 on Sephora
and you get one point zero eight ounces
of product so tiny tiny bit more than a
standard fluid ounce I was super excited
when I heard Rihanna was coming out with
her own makeup line I'm probably gonna
get murdered for this statement but
Beyonce doesn't do that much for me I'm
like much more of Rihanna fan anyone
else out there I actually ended up going
into this forest store which I never do
to get shade matched because I had no
frickin clue what shade I was gonna be
get ready there are 40 freakin shades of
this foundation which is amazing part of
the reason why I went into the floor 2
is to get samples of a couple shades so
I guess wash them for you guys so I do
have the shade 101 10 which is this one
and 120 which I'm gonna swatch so 110 is
actually the shade that I got shade
match 2 in Sephora but she just did a
neck match you didn't like put it all
over my face so this one is actually way
too light for me so if you are very fair
there are definitely shades that are
gonna work for you but I'm mincer
swatches right here so you can see what
these three shades look like compared to
some of my other foundations so right
here's actually the Kat Von D lock-it
tattoo foundation and l42 I wanted to
swatch this one first because I think
that's a super super pale shade of
foundation that a lot of people can
compare to this is personally way too
light for me but just so you can see how
compared I also really don't like this
foundation but anyways so right here's
the Fendi beauty foundation in the
lightest shade 100 next to it is it in
the shade 110 and 120 this one I feel
like 120 especially has oxidized these
ones I didn't notice a whole lot of
oxidizing happening but since i swatched
it it's been a few minutes and this one
I can definitely tell darkened a bit but
as you can see compared to l42 I would
say the closest is kind of 110 actually
as far as tone and everything I still
see l42 being a little bit lighter
slightly but still the fact that these
two are the lightest shades I think are
awesome there is a big jump I feel like
between 110 and 120 but next to it here
is the milk makeup foundation in the
shade fair derma called 2:08 Urban Decay
Naked skin and 0.5 and pur cosmetics
bare at all in porcelain so again here's
all of them next to each other
alright so reading some of the claims on
the Fenty Beauty website it says this is
a soft matte long wear foundation with
buildable medium to full coverage in a
boundary breaking range of 40 shades
gives skin and instantly smooth poor
diffused shine free finish that easily
builds to medium to full coverage
resistant to sweat and humidity won't
clog your pores long wearing lightest
aired texture and it is cruelty free if
you're new here you can join the BAE
Rito family and subscribe if you guys
are excited for day 13 don't forget to
give this video a thumbs up let's jump
into it put this on my face if you want
to see what I think at the fenty Beauty
Foundation how it applies somewheres
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching I just realized
I'm pretty sure I left my mic on all
night
whoops so with this foundation you are
supposed to like majorly prep your skin
so exfoliate moisturize and prime so I'm
going to use my normal primer on half my
face the Revlon Photoready app or
reducing primer and then I'm gonna try
the Fenty's soft matte pro filter primer
which she gave me a little sample of the
girl at Sephora just to see if there is
a difference throughout the day if it
wears any differently
ooh I like the packaging on this one it
has like a tan cap this one retails for
$32 and it says it's a shine stopping
pore reducing primer that smooths away
for better foundation application and
longer wear with an instant
perfect cease this is all over my
leg Durer Lee my legs are gonna be nice
and poreless anyway so we'll see if this
does anything different throughout the
day it feels like a like a lotion almost
like a lightweight lotion does it feel
silicone or anything my face right now
is very well moisturized doesn't seem to
be filling in my pores at all doesn't
really look any different definitely has
a smell to it let's use my Revlon
Photoready on the other side one's
awesome at reducing your pores
I don't really bring this all the way
across my cheeks when I put this on I
kind of just Pat it I do put it all over
my forehead because I have so much
texture there we are primed I'm gonna
give that a minute to set in by the way
right now it is 9:18 and it's the day
after the launch is september 9th right
now and I'm filming this so I've only
seen a few videos on this foundation
because it's literally the next morning
I'm a little bit concerned because both
videos I wash are from people who have
beautiful flawless skin and even they
said that it emphasized some of their
texture so I'm a little worried because
I have lots of texture so let's do this
I have a feeling I'm gonna have to mix
the shade 120 with 110 so the actual
foundation I picked up the shade 110
because that's what I got shade match
two in Sephora but I have a feeling this
is gonna be too light awesome that they
make super super pale shades for those
of you who are very fair someone
snatched me I think or tweeted that
there my skin tone and they got the
shade 150 I think spelled 150 neutral or
something it's funny because I was
looking at that one in this store and in
the bottle it looked like it could match
me but I was like no there's no way 150
so I almost feel like 150 you may have
been better than 120 for me to pick up
because this one swatched very like
yellow orange II almost the box
packaging is beautiful I love at the
font I love everything about her
packaging I also picked up a couple
other products frosted glass bottle
super pretty there's a pump and it feels
nice and heavy if they didn't like cheap
out on the packaging at all it says
always shake before use to activate
let's activate this thing sounds pretty
liquidy I can hear it in there so this
is interesting in the Sephora store they
told me that it acts
and then on here is been on the claims
on their website it says the rich
pigments need a moment to dry down to
their truest colors so when you're
testing shades remember to let the
formula dry completely to find your
perfect match so from what I've seen and
it literally says on the website this
oxidizes like pretty quickly I just
wanted to add I saw it
instagrams story by senti beauty the
other day and they claim that it's not
oxidizing it's just deepening to its
truest color so whatever you want to
call it but it does darken and they're
aware of that so I might mix it light so
with that in mind let's just see what
the shade 110 is like okay so on its own
that is definitely too light for me see
120 looks very yellow which does not
look good on my skintone
okay I think I'm just gonna mix the two
I don't think I'm either of those okay
so I mixed in a little bit of one 2000
okay that like totally dried down let's
just going top there
before everyone gets their panties in a
bunch I know the shade is too light kind
of what I'm working with because the
shade 120 would look totally off with
the undertones I'm just kind of betting
on the fact that this is gonna darken it
smells like the same as the primer it
smells like a powder like a baby powder
okay that's not looking the best let's
try the forehead by the way I'm gonna
try this sponge on the other side just
kidding i'm swatching with sponge
because whoa that looks pretty bad on my
texture and dryness up here it's like
emphasizing every little thing it's also
not covering very well at all so on one
layer I'm getting about medium coverage
it does say you can build this up all
right I'm gonna go in on this side with
a sponge see what happens it looks a bit
patchy I still don't like how it looks
at all getting definitely lighter
coverage with the sponge but the finish
looks better I use the whole amount so
I'm gonna mix some more and try and
build this up before I do that I'm gonna
get really close in a second so you can
see what I'm talking about because it
looks pretty right now okay
I just dimmed the ring light I still
don't think it's really showing up like
over here it is emphasizing everything
and like clinging on to dryness a
shit-ton it's just like clinging to
everything my nose looks very dry I'm
gonna try and build this up with a
sponge since definitely looks better on
my skin with a sponge it is building I'm
definitely getting better coverage I
never have my nose look this freaking
dry have you guys ever seen my nose look
like this it is so dry looking no no no
I gotta show you guys this up close not
really sure how to save my face right
now I usually have my areas where I have
texture where foundation might not look
the best like the center of my forehead
my forehead but this is like places
where foundation usually looks so good
on like down here and I don't have a ton
of like dryness over here or anything
but it's making my skin
look like I do I would not put this on
my face alone again it looks really bad
on my skin if you have any kind of
dryness texture or anything I would pass
on this one I was supposed to go out at
the house today but I don't know if
that's happening right now
it hasn't like instantly oxidized on my
skin so we'll see in a few hours if it
darkens up at all because yeah right now
it does look too light all right I'm
just gonna hope that the rest of my
makeup can kind of rescue my face today
so I can go outside by the way I'm not
gonna powder my face with this because
this was designed for oily skin it's
supposed to last about a powder you
don't need a powder with this one right
now it's almost 9:40 so that's when
we'll call the check-in time I'm gonna
do the rest of my makeup and I'll be
right back okay so it's now 1012 the
rest of my makeup is on and I am just
not into this at all I did a bunch of
close up so you can see what I'm talking
about
I think the close-ups kind of speak for
themselves my nose I don't think I've
ever seen look this dry and patchy it
kind of just clings on to everything my
nose isn't usually one of my problem
areas at all my forehead is but this
looks pretty bad like I always say
foundations look so different on
different people this might look great
on your skin but on my skin with texture
and everything it looks very bad I would
never put this on my face again now that
it's been on for what a half hour about
I do think it's oxidized a little bit
like a matches much better now but I
think this side of my face does look
slightly better so I do think the Fenty
primer did something I would use that
primer again and try it out with
different foundations because I do think
it did a little something so that's
where I'm at right now with the
foundation I think you get it I did try
out the Fenton Beattie highlighter this
is the kilowatt highlighter duo and girl
next door and she Creek and it's like
this pinky highlight this was beautiful
I mean look at the highlight right now
when done with this one which is like
more of a wet kind of sheen this one is
a bit more glittery ended up using that
on my lid shade a little bit and also
this one I tried adding a little bit of
this to my cheeks and it was a little
bit too glittery for me but I do love
this shade that is a beautiful highlight
the highlighter is beautiful I also got
a different highlight but I'm going to
try
in a first impressions video it's that
big white one but on the rest of my face
for contour and for all of my matte
eyeshadows I use the Tarte clay clay
play palette I went in with this shade
as a bronzer since I really wanted to
warm up my face blush I use the Laura
Geller tropic hues blush which is really
pretty for lips I use the urban decay
abstract lipstick this Becca lip gloss
on top well I'm like a majorly slouchin
here's a shade okay an amethyst geode so
I'll see you guys in a few hours and
natural lighting
okay so right now it's 134 so it's been
on for four hours and it looks a lot
like dewier now it doesn't look oily it
actually outside I feel like it looked a
little bit more dewy than it is right
now you can see a little bit of shine on
my forehead I actually like it better
now than when I first put it on because
it looks more like skin and on its like
matte and dry everywhere around my nose
in my upper lip still look the same
there's something like creasing on my
upper lip I think it's just mostly my
forehead right now that still looks
really bad and my nose oh by the way I
got my ears pierced pretty she's cut I
got that one put back in cuz I fell out
and then I got a little third one over
here focus this looks pretty dry over
here but I think as my oils are coming
through it does look better here's the
rest of my face so I'll see you guys at
the end of the night
okay so it's 650 so it's been on for
nine hours I'm cutting this one a little
bit early because I'm going to a
barbecue thing right now
it definitely oxidized throughout the
day but now it just matches my body
since I did put it on a bit light so
keep that in mind if you're gonna be
picking a shade
I wouldn't recommend picking a shade
this is just my experience with it guys
I mean I've seen this look great on some
people on my skin it just looks horrible
I would not put this on again it's worn
better throughout the day because my
oils are coming through I wouldn't say
this is an oil controlling foundation I
am pretty oily on my forehead around my
nose pretty much everywhere I'd rather
look like this and how it looked when I
first put it on like super creepy and
dry everywhere my forehead still looks
super dry and it's like clinging to
weird spots like a husband all day
it is separating on my chin I should
zoom you guys in can you focus the reel
so you can see upper lip creasing it
seems to be separating right here the
nose has just looked horrible a day I've
never had a foundation quite look this
bad on my nose yeah it's like separating
on the center of my forehead all over
here this just really didn't work out
for my skin if you have dry skin I would
stay the heck away from this thing I
wouldn't recommend it for any skin type
but that's just because of the
experience that I had with it but if it
looked that dry and horrible on my skin
I would say a pass unless you have like
very flawless skin with minimal texture
might just be one of those foundations
that you know just doesn't agree with
any kind of texture or anything someone
commented the other day saying they're
tired of negative reviews girl me too
you think I want to have shitty
foundations on my face all day I would
much rather have a bunch of foundations
that workout and I could recommend to
you guys but that's just not the case
this time around so unfortunately
there's only been a couple winners this
time around but I don't know I think it
also gives you guys some kind of idea of
what not to buy I think if you have a
similar skin type and everything to me
but I hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you did make sure you give it a
thumbs up if you're new here
you can join the burrito family and
subscribe only a couple days left a 15-8
foundation but new videos go up at 6
p.m. Pacific time so I love you guys
thanks for watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
