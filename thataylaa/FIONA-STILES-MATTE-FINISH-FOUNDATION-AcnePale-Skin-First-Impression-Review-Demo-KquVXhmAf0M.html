they hear Fiona Styles might be alone on
that one alright so today it is
foundation Friday who's excited I'm
excited it's actually Friday when I'm
filming this so I'm feeling the
foundation Friday excitement you know
I'm saying we're going to be talking
about one that has been very highly
requested lately this is the Fiona
Styles matte finish foundation
concentrate why don't you put that back
in the box so this one has been up there
with the new a cosmetics cushion
foundation that one is coming to product
retails for $30 you can find it at Ulta
and you get one fluid ounce of product
in here foundation comes in ten shades
and Ives the shades zero one porcelain
so I have combination skin with cystic
acne I typically get oily throughout the
day on my t-zone let's look on Alta and
read some of the claims about this
product so since a lightweight
foundation concentrate that absorbs oil
camouflages imperfections and delivers a
long-lasting velvet matte finish this
highly pigmented formula blends
effortlessly to create a soft focus
effect on the skin hides imperfections
evens out skin tone mattifies with the
non oily perfectly powdered finish never
smudges and suitable for all undertones
that's interesting I'm not sure what
they mean by that I don't know if it
kind of addressed to your skin tone or
if they've just kind of covered the
undertones in each shade so as highly
concentrated pigments means a little
goes a long way and then they just kind
of repeat themselves three times
Gionta styles is cruelty free some
inserts and swatches right now so you
can see how this foundation compares to
some of the other lightest shades I also
want to say I think the two closest
shade matches for me right now are the
derma called 2:08 and the pur cosmetics
paradol foundation in porcelain both of
those look totally different swatch but
for some reason they both completely
work on my skin tone I think my
undertones have kind of changed over the
years I feel more neutral now but I
think I can swing either way
alright so slash time right here is the
Fionna Stiles foundation in the lightest
shade zero one next over is pur
cosmetics bear doll and porcelain derma
called 2:08 Tarte rainforest of the sea
and the new lightest shade porcelain and
then last is Urban Decay Naked
and 0.5 if you enjoy foundation Friday
make sure you give this video a thumbs
up so if you want to see how the Fiona
style the matte finish foundation
applies and wears throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching feels like a sauna in here
right now so I haven't taken this guy
out of the box yet oh I didn't turn my
face let's do that so I've washed
moisturized in now primed my face using
my Joey anti blemish matte primer a
bunch of you guys on the oil controlling
primer video recommended the Becca ever
matte primer and as soon as I saw all
the comments about that I purchased it
on Sephora so I'm going to try that out
and I'll let you guys know what I think
of it this is heavy feels really nice
quality is glass but also the lid is
really cool it has these like angles on
it and there's a pump yes so on one side
my face I'm going to use a brush today
I'm using the elf brush that I use for
foundation is technically a powder brush
but it works awesome for foundations
they never have names on the brushes but
I'm gonna leave the exact one linked
down below in the description box and on
the other side I'm using my pur
cosmetics sponge so I'm going to shake
this on line is a little bit of this
goes a long way so if it ever comes out
of the pump has literally been pumping
this thing for like two minutes now
Beaufort come in here we go it has a
really tiny opening on the pump maybe
it's because you don't need a lot so I'm
just going to start out with a super
tiny amount this is like a dime sized
amount and let's do this it feels really
lightweight almost like a serum the way
this is going on okay so with one layer
and the brush I'm getting about medium
coverage ask me is still definitely
coming through and even when I put it
directly on my acne down here it didn't
really cover it up right now this is not
looking matte to me at all for being
what's supposed to be a matte foundation
this feels very moisturizing so I'm
going to go and with fog the same amount
on the other side and let's try this
sun's out see if we get any different
kind of coverage oddly enough this side
to me is looking a tiny bit more matte
usually you get kind of the opposite
effect with sponges it typically makes
it a little bit more dewy I wouldn't say
a little bit of this goes a long way I
feel like I'm just using a normal
the product right now I think I got
better coverage on the sponge side which
is also a little bit odd because I
typically get much better coverage with
the brush but with this foundation I do
think I like the way it looks better on
this side so as you can see I wouldn't
call this full coverage at all you can
still see freckles some redness scarring
acne it didn't really cover any of my
acne down here so for the second layer
I'm going to go back and with the sponge
see if this is buildable which go away
too much I do think if you want full
coverage you still have to use a spot
concealer over this because even though
on areas like my forehead right here it
looks full coverage because there's
nothing to really cover up down here it
definitely doesn't still look full
coverage but it is buildable on the
second layer I would say it looks like
now high medium coverage I mean you can
still see some redness and stuff coming
through yeah it's looking very glowy
like look at my forehead just doesn't
look matte at all I do like how it feels
really lightweight a formula this almost
feels like the make up for ever ultra HD
foundation so my forehead looks nice
it's not clinging anywhere it doesn't
look really kicked up around my nose or
anything I'm sure you guys close up okay
so here it is on the second layer and my
forehead looks really nice and smooth
some defining is I need to set this one
on line it says that you don't have to
set it it feels not totally setting down
since it is supposed to be a mattifying
foundation I almost don't want to set it
so I can really see how it controls my
oil so I think that's what we're going
to do right now it is 907 got a new lock
screen background feeling it also switch
the seven plus big news here call the
check in time nine ten ninety nine
percent sure I'm not going to set this
but I'm going to do the rest of my
makeup and see how I'm feeling and I'll
be right back okay so it's now nine
twenty eight we did that pretty fast
rest of my makeup is obviously on I
ended up setting just the center of my
face literally right here with the Laura
Geller double take baked versatile
powder foundation in porcelain this is
one of my three go to setting powders if
some reason I feel like my cheeks this
area modified a lot more than my
forehead bed so if I didn't set the
center of my face with my forehead with
the powder I think
still it pretty satin because you can
see over here but I love the way the
powder went on on top of this foundation
it just looks very airbrushed and smooth
you can't see the texture of the powder
at all and I went back on and read on
the website and I think I just thought
it was supposed to be full coverage
because it says highly pigmented formula
and I've just been kind of hearing that
it's full coverage so I just want to
correct myself that it doesn't actually
claim to be full coverage it does say
it's highly pigmented and the does say
it's supposed to hide imperfection so
that usually means higher coverage I did
add a little bit of concealer only down
here on my neck I didn't put concealer
on top of any other acne or anything so
overall it's looking really nice
especially around my nose area so right
now my only beef with this is that it's
not matte like it says and I don't think
I would say this is a concentrated
highly pigmented formula it just seems
like a medium coverage foundation so
quickly talk about what's on the rest of
my face I always mention every product
I'm wearing down below in description
box t-shirt earrings watch everything is
always down below so to contour I use
one of my favorite shades the morphe 9c
palette and I just went in with this
shade I mentioned this in my favorite
contour products for pale skin video
which I will put an eye over here
this is stroboscope by moon play
cosmetics in the shade NYC vamp and I
thought this was going to be like a
light pink kind of highlight and it was
straight-up purple I put that on first
kind of like all over my cheeks and then
I had to tone it down a bit when I went
in with all my news moths blush one of
my favorite blushes and to add a bit
more lightness to the highlight I used
my ELF illuminating palette another one
of my favorites the shade I have hit pan
on I love this as a highlight as I used
my Urban Decay Naked ultimate basics
palette also loved this thing and then I
smoked it out with the black eyeshadow
in here and then a shit-ton of mascara
what's new and outlet this shade I am in
love with I've been kind of iffy on the
formula Z's just because I really don't
like the stickiness that I get with some
of the shades but this one I don't feel
at all so I don't know what's going on
this is the wet and wild liquid cat suit
in nudi patootie I love the shade of
this and this one totally dried down so
I'm not sure if it's just certain shades
you get the sticky this one feels
totally great majorly pre-recording and
pre-editing and everything for the trip
because then we gone when you get
actually I'm going to be back when you
sheamus so I need to edit three videos
today happy Friday
so check back in with you guys in a few
hours the next check and I do will be in
natural lighting okay so it's now a 2:15
so everything has been on for pretty
much exactly five hours and we are in
natural lighting so here's what it's
looking like I feel like it's oxidized a
little bit I was in my car running some
errands and it looks very smooth I
definitely get the whole soft focus
claim I think that is spot on but I
still don't feel that matte i wouldn't
say i'm getting oily on my forehead
already but it definitely looks dewy
hoping it doesn't turn into oil by the
end of the night actually you know what
i am already a little bit oily it looks
really nice around my nose it still
looks pretty good start back in with you
guys at the end of the night alright so
it is now 7:05 so it's been on for
pretty much 10 hours at this point I'm
about to go eat a burger watch shameless
I'm excited I definitely feel pretty
oily kind of all day I mean you guys
thought last check-in my forehead was
starting to get oily but now I feel like
it's oily even on the center of my
forehead where I powdered it it almost
looks a little bit oilier it doesn't
look really great around my nose or on
my chin so I think you guys will be able
to see this but it just looks pretty
heavy around here and it totally is
separating around my nose and also on my
chin is looking a little bit pebbly and
like in this area it just looks pretty
dry and textured and my forehead just
looks pretty oily it's also totally
rubbed off up here where I move my bangs
over that happens sometimes but it
usually doesn't totally rub off this is
like there's no foundation up here I
think my cheek areas are the only areas
where it looks good at this point for me
personally I don't think this one is
super long-lasting it doesn't have quite
enough coverage that I like it oxidized
and I don't feel like it really
mattified me at all even when I first
applied it I'm really not getting the
Matt vibe here I don't know where that
came from I don't think it's horrible I
just think I have foundations that I
like better that hold up throughout the
day I think this one could be okay if
you have normal to dry skin even I don't
know I'm not disappointed by this one
I'm just
not super wowed at all if you have tried
this one let me know down below say your
skin type and if you liked it or you
didn't like it because the most curious
how products work for different people
and I always say this but just because I
like something doesn't mean that you
won't like it you could love something
that I hate and vice versa so this is
just my opinion do your own research
watch other videos if you guys like this
video make sure you give it a thumbs up
so I know love you guys thanks for
watching see you my next video I know
this product really what word was that
that was like the definition of word
vomit right there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
