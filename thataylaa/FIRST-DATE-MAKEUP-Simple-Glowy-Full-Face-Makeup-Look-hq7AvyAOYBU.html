what I do for first date makeup I've had
a lot of time to perfect this routine
because I have been on a lot of first
dates let me tell you I am so excited
because this video is actually sponsored
by tinder which is so freaking cool
because I've used tinder since I was a
senior in college done a lot of swiping
in my days that's some really strong
thumb muscle now if you never heard of
tinder it's a dating app where you can
swipe to meet people in your area and
connect you just right swipe and then
hopefully you have a match but my
favorite place to tinder and to watch
people tinder is the airport you can
always tell when someone's tindering
because of their thumb motions so if
you're also a single lady or man can
check out tinder on social and download
the app to meet people in your area and
tinder works I have a couple people in
real life who they have met their
significant others from tinder hopefully
our day is coming so this look is what I
do pretty much every single first date
I like glowy skin I like to keep things
more neutral and obviously I still like
to look put together and like slightly
glam I usually don't wear false lashes I
tell you guys about that but I just want
to show you as an option but I like to
keep it a little bit more natural with
the brows natural with the lips and just
glowy skin by the way there is something
magical about this nail color I don't
know what the heck it is about this but
every single time without fail that I
wear this color around a guy whether
it's a friend on a first date anything
they always freaking comment on this
nail color it's magic but if you want to
give them something easy to compliment
you on right off the bat wear this nail
polish color without fail I'm telling
you try it out let me know how it goes
for you so I hope you guys enjoy this
video if you're excited for it don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up if
you're new here you can join the burrito
family and subscribe I upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific
time since this is a sponsored video
tomorrow I have a bonus video going up 6
p.m. Pacific time Tuesday my first step
for any makeup always is the Too Faced
hangover 3 and 1 primer spray this just
gives you a really pretty glow but also
Prime's your face and makes your makeup
stay on this is just redness from laying
on a hot pack but I'm a tiny bit
sunburned too right now I usually go for
a natural ish kind of look my version of
like a natural
so I have a few different foundations
that I kind of just switched between
depending on what I'm feeling that day
so I'm gonna show you guys what I would
normally reach for just to get that kind
of more natural glowy skin like look so
I'll either do the Estee Lauder Double
Wear nude the water fresh makeup I have
a whole video on this I love this
foundation I do have to mix this in with
something so either mix this in with
like CYO life proof or something to
lighten it this just gives you that
really fresh face look or I'll use the
Becca aqua luminous this is in the shade
porcelain this one's also a little bit
dark I actually like using foundations
about a half a shade too dark for dates
or just going out in general I don't
know what it is but I feel like
especially at nighttime maybe just
because it's less noticeable it's almost
a little bit more flattering to do a
half shade darker in your foundation
that's usually what I do
and then the wet-and-wild cushion
foundation is the other option so these
kind of all give a similar kind of dewy
a little bit lighter coverage kind of
look if you have acne or if you need a
little bit more coverage you can mix in
something like derma Cohen with any of
these just to give it more coverage or
you could spot conceal on top or you
could use the cosmetics CC cream
illumination so today I just want to use
the Becca aqua luminous foundation I'm
going to give this a good shake
I just like to stipple this on like that
gives the most coverage and I just feel
like this foundation gives me such a
skin-like look that it's perfect for
dates because it doesn't look like
you're wearing a ton of makeup on your
face this isn't a full coverage
foundation or anything so I do still
have some scarring and redness and stuff
coming through if I want to I can just
spot concealed up actually like leaving
it like that cuz then it doesn't look
quite as makeup II I'm about you guys
but when I shower before a first date
that's like my time to prep it's like my
prep time sounds like I'm prepping for
an interview kinda what it's like
sometimes I just like go through some of
the basic questions in my head just to
you know get in the mind space I also
usually bless music well I'm getting
ready but copyright for my forehead I'm
just smoothing this over with a sponge
just to give it that really smooth dewy
look up there um I know this anymore but
I usually get creasing too so I don't
actually like a super bright lifted kind
of under-eye like I usually do for date
makeup because again it's just kind of
drawing more attention to your makeup
and doesn't look as natural so I'm just
gonna go with the flower beauty light
illusion concealer this is normally too
dark for me normally I'll mix in a
little bit of the k'kaw concealer but
because my friend Asian shade is a bit
right now and I'm not going for a super
bright and dry I'll just go in with this
basically just to cancel out the
darkness underneath my eyes I'm just
using the morphe G 38 brush why do I
still have to look at the name of this
every single time use this brush every
day of my life I'm just gonna super
lightly set it with my normal two
powders I'm not gonna mix it as bright
as I normally would so I'll probably use
mostly Physicians Formula and I'm using
a different brush than usual because
this one just gives a really light kind
of powder application if I'm fully
setting my under eyes I will use my BH I
think it's the 137 or the elf brush I
always link my brushes down below I'm
just pressing this end I say what this
is is the Kat Von D 25 brush it's gonna
depend on what kind of skin you have I
have dry skin so I don't like a whole
lot of powder on my face but just set
just my cheek area I'm gonna go with
mice for my Christmas powder this is a
great powder that doesn't look powdery
and I only set the areas I need to which
is right here so that I can blend
bronzer blush and highlight I feel like
brows are one of those things with guys
and makeup where there's just like a
little bit of a disconnect there most
guys can't appreciate a strong brow do
you if you're someone who really loves a
full-on brow then do it I can kind of go
either way if I'm just wearing makeup on
a day-to-day basis I'll usually just put
on some kind of brow gel or just really
lightly fill in my brows do whatever
makes you feel confident and happy and
comfortable but for first dates I
usually don't do a full-on kind of
carved out brow I like to keep it a
little bit more simple for the eyebrows
especially because that is something
that oddly enough guys kind of zoom in
on so I'm going in with the Loreal brow
gel this is the brow stylist boots and
set in the shade dark brunette it's
actually a lighter brunette I would say
it's kind of like a more medium brown so
I like to use it for this kind of look
nothing too hard here if there's an area
where I need a little bit more shape I
like to add a tiny bit of arch up here
so that's when I'll go in with my
Maybelline I should have actually done
this I have an actual tinder date in
like two days
should have filmed this before that and
I'm gonna do this all again you know
what I hope some guys watch this video
so they know what the heck effort we put
into this I've wiped off a lot of the
product I have barely anything on the
brush right now and I'm just gonna add a
tiny bit of shape right up here I'm
going with my usual
Mac Paint Pot to prime my eyelids I do
like to contour my face because I want
to just add a little definition make
some cheekbones appear
if you have fair skin one of my favorite
contour shades is actually this elf
eyebrow kit this is in the shade light
this shade right here is great for a
contour if you have a lighter skin tone
so I'm just gonna go with my wet and
wild contour brush this just creates a
really faint contour you can build it up
depending on how much you want but I
don't find that this one looks too ashy
and too gray sometimes contour shades
can look really muddy if you don't know
where to draw in your contour you
literally just go from the corner of
your mouth to the top of your ear and
that's kind of the area that you want to
contour don't bring it all the way down
I just bring it about a third of the way
maybe a little bit more I like to add a
little bit underneath my bottom lip it's
just creates a little shadow under there
to make your bottom lip look a little
bit more plump a pinky kind of blush is
one of those things that I just love and
I feel like can look really flattering
for a date because it just kind of warms
up your face and it almost gives you
that romantic kind of vibe I'm gonna go
with the ciate summer love I really
wanted to use the shade date night just
so I could say it but this one's a
little bit darker than what I'm going
for right now so summer love is one of
my favorite blush shades of all time
this is a glowy or blush I wouldn't say
it's shimmery but it is glowy again
that's the look I'm going for but if you
don't like glowy blushes then you could
just go in with any kind of matte pink
shade I'm not gonna do bronzer you want
to do bronzer by all means go for it
blend out my blush I would just go back
in with this brush is the fur less cb4
there's nothing on it right now it's
just whatever leftover kind of face
powders on there and this just helps
make everything look kind of seamless
we're going for a glowy look so I always
like to add a highlight I'm gonna go in
with one of my all-time favorites this
is the Physicians Formula shimmer brick
and natural nude that's a long brush err
how long has that been there protip
don't go on a first date with a long
black hair on your face I just kind of
go in at the mix of these lighter shades
here for my highlight you can use these
as eyeshadows too or something about
this highlighter that just gives you
that like angelic kind of glow it's like
this would be super pretty for wedding
makeup if you also have textured skin
this doesn't emphasize it it just gives
you that glow look at that and do my
Cupid's bow and the tip of my nose to
one of my favorite steps of all-time
setting spray makeup ever mission set if
you're looking for an event setting
spray wedding setting spray first date
setting spray anything where you really
want your makeup to stay on this stuff
is legit it works I've gone through so
many bottles of this it smells like feet
but it works amazing
I really take a shower in this stuff
make sure you spray perfume after so you
don't smell like feet it also gives you
a really pretty glow and it just melts
all of your powder products together in
your foundation even if you don't
believe in setting spray for making your
makeup stay on longer just use it for
the sole reason of melting all those
products together it makes your skin
look so much more skin like okay so for
eyes I like to keep it super simple I'll
usually just going with about two eyes
shadow shades usually matte once and
I'll do some kind of pop on the inner
corner so I would say just go with
whatever eyeshadow shades make your eyes
pop for me there's something about this
Smashbox trio it reminds me of the
Physicians Formula one I used to use
like years ago which I need to pick up
again but the shades in this this is
nudie pic fair I don't think the formula
these are you know outstanding or
anything for the price but the shades
there's something about these tones that
just really make green eyes pop just a
cover my entire eyelid I'm first going
to go in with this light nude kind of
shade here and I just put this on my
finger and just press this on now that I
got that color in there I'm gonna go
with the lighter of the two right here
and I'm just gonna take this on the
morphe m 511 and just do a tiny bit of
this right into the crease blend in back
and forth they're gonna be staring at
your eyes 99% of the night hopefully so
I want my eyes to pop but I don't want
it to be you know like a full-blown
smoky eye I'm taking the tiniest bit of
the darker gray shade now and with that
same brush just fluffing this only about
halfway now I'm not gonna bring this all
the way in so for eyeliner I kind of
switch off between two different things
depending on how good of luck I feel
like I'm gonna have with the wing that
day it's basically what it boils down to
so either will do a really really tiny
wing like a more natural wing or what
I'll do is I'll take a black pencil
liner and I'll just line right here and
then kind of smudge it out just so my
eyes are still defined and they pop but
I don't have to do a winged liner so I
think today since I am feeling more of a
softer look I'm gonna do the pencil
eyeliner method and I'm just running
this right close to my lashes I'm gonna
bring it a little bit farther out to
make my eye shape look bigger than it is
if anything I don't want to be going
down I want to be going up so I still
get that kind of lifted eye look so I'm
just starting with a tiny amount and I'm
gonna go in the flat edge brush and I'm
just going to basically smudge this
we're just going back and forth and
bringing
in a little bit more and I kind of
create just like a softer wing I guess
with this kind of hard to mess us up
which is also the good thing if you're
in a rush and you're getting ready for
your date or if you just don't feel like
you can go there with a winged liner
this can be a good alternative for you
lately my wings have been getting a
little wild so I never really know
what's gonna happen you know I'm saying
so you can see the difference it still
gives you that kind of cat eye look it's
just a little bit softer than winged
eyeliner if you are doing this again
make sure that you set your eyelid with
something so that the eyeliner doesn't
transfer up the good thing about using a
flat edged brush is that you really
don't have to shape it too much because
if you just pull it upwards in a
diagonal motion you're already basically
gonna have a wing created for you so
just to make me look a little bit more
awake and open up my eyes even more I'm
gonna go in with the white eyeliner you
can do a nude eyeliner if you don't want
a super stark white but this just really
makes your eyes pop I'm gonna go back in
with this darker gray shade on the same
flat edged brush you're not gonna fully
line my lower lash line
I just want to line the outer part right
here super set alone you know if you
guys can see the difference on camera so
my favorite part for the eyes I'm gonna
add an inner corner highlight I'm gonna
go back in with this light shade right
here the white and if you want this to
really pop you could always wet them I
might go in with my finger in a sec so
for me I don't usually like to wear
false lashes on dates because I feel
like I'm just gonna be focusing on the
lashes I don't know what it is about
lashes but I can always feel them on my
eyes I just want to be focused on them
and food not my lashes so I usually just
go into my two normal mascaras and just
kind of layer these and then I always do
wet and wild make a length on the bottom
lashes but for the sake of the video
just in case some of you guys do want to
wear lashes I'm gonna put on these
lashes for this video that I'll or 0 0 5
s if I were to do lashes I would do
something like these because these are
just corner lashes they're not gonna be
super obvious that you have on false
lashes
alright so my lashes are on if you also
have issues with lashes these are
probably the most comfortable non feely
ones I've put on because they don't
totally irritate them and I feel like
they're a good amount of lash okay so
all we have left is lips now sometimes
I'll just straight away go in with the
cords lip butter this is in the things
Jasmine one is it not say Oh Jasmine
right on stuff I do want to add just a
tiny bit of shape first just to define
the outside of my lip so I'm gonna go
with the LA girl non-stop nude liner
that's one of my favorite nude liners
the reason why I don't like using a
liquid lipstick or lipstick
or something is because sometimes when
you're talking and eating and drinking
liquid lipstick can do that thing where
it just like rubs off right on the
center and that's not a cute look so if
you just use something like a lip butter
this is basically just like a tinted lip
balm so it just gives you that kind of
plump look but if it wears off it just
wears off evenly and you're not gonna
have any of that left over like lip
product residue on there so that's why I
just really lightly line with lip liner
I don't do this all over I just I'm
gonna add to certain areas so one of
those areas is our right here just so
you get that fullness down there and
then over here where my lip line kind of
disappears a little bit and then I'm
just gonna lightly kind of feather that
now I'm just gonna go in with the Korres
lip butter so I just dip my nail in
there this stuff is growing on me if you
have really chapped lips it does not
look the best this used to look really
creepy on me and it kind of settles in
the thing I like about the lineage is
that it doesn't do that it really just
plumps but I love the color of this and
it's like the perfect natural nude where
it just gives you a little something but
it doesn't look like you have a ton of
lip product on it also not enough
pigment to where it's gonna transfer on
your teeth so you just don't have to
worry about that either alright so this
is the final makeup look ready for a
date my shirt I almost always go with
like one of three shirts I switch
between have kind of an off-the-shoulder
black one or this white one which this
is from forever 21 I don't know if they
still carry it but it has this like what
do they call this sweetheart neckline
kind of thing where it dips feel like it
shows off a good amount of your chest
and collarbone and stuff they don't have
a lot of cleavage action going on for
hair I always do the same thing I just
do these big loose kind of curls I'll
just kind of separate them and brush
them out so they're not super curled I
just use the t3 curling iron for this
I'll have this one link down below mine
has like hair extension tape or
something on it so I hope you guys
