freakin see I'm back in America so
that's exciting I'm going to film a
whole of their update video soon very
soon so I'm just going to jump into this
video so we don't get off topic today I
thought I'd do a first impressions video
on the covergirl clean whipped cream
foundation and this is a new product or
for me it is because I just got back to
the States
no but I think it's I think it's fairly
new first impressions videos are my
favorite type of videos to watch lately
so I figured why not make one myself as
you'll see in the footage of me applying
it I did decide to apply a powder with
this foundation just because I know most
people don't do that first impressions
videos but for me and I think most
people you do wear powder on a daily
basis so I don't know makes more sense
to me to apply it with the powder so you
can see how it lasts as you would wear
it but comment down below and let me
know if that's how you like the videos
or if you'd rather have it without a
powder powder I use is the Maybelline
mineral power powder foundation this is
great if you want a completely full
coverage look as you'll see in the video
how to helped a lot to cover up some of
the acne and scarring that the
foundation didn't cover up haven't
filmed in like five hundred years this
feels bizarre I'm in the shade 310 I'm
actually not sure if this is gonna be
the right shade because I have self tan
it looks pretty good
we'll see it is point six fluid ounces I
really like the container of this right
off the bat they don't waste any space
the huge Revlon whipped foundation it's
like 5% foundation and 95% glass let's
get into this so this is what the
product looks like inside the jar smells
like cherries and play-doh has a very
strong smell so that's interesting I am
just going to use my fingers because
that's what works well with the Revlon
Colorstay whipped foundation no idea how
this is gonna work with our fingers but
oh you will see guess that's why it's
the first impression I'm just kind of
dabbing it down my face I feel like this
may be a lot
oh it's very soft wow it feels really
nice time your skin feels super
lightweight I would say this goes a lot
more lightweight than the Revlon
Colorstay it's covering up my asking it
very well as you can see I think for my
body right now self Panem eyes it might
be a little bit too light
well that's what they made bronzer for
right feels super lightweight I really
like it
obviously if you don't have lots of acne
and acne scarring you're not going to
need as much product as I'm using but I
feel like a full coverage thanks
yeah I think it looks even lighter on
camera and person I really doesn't want
that light but I guess when I'm not
self-tanning it'll be a good foundation
sheet I mean for me I would say this is
medium coverage it does cover up a lot
of the redness but you can still see it
a little bit definitely not full
coverage you can still see my freckles
and everything I'm gonna go ahead and do
a second layer just to see how buildable
this is it feels really nice like it
feels so soft when you blend it into
your skin
yeah if you didn't have acne you could
definitely wear this alone and be said
go ahead and apply concealer powder and
everything and then I will be back hey
guys so I just wanted to film an outside
shot so you guys can see what the
foundation looks like in actual lighting
I think it looks really good I really
like the finish of it and also to let
you know that it is ten o'clock because
in the morning because I forgot to film
that that's what happens when you don't
film for a century so I'll be checking
back throughout the day so you can see
how the foundation wore throughout the
day okay so it is now 1:35 and I am
currently going to run errands for
father dearest because he forgot is my
parents anniversary so I'm going to get
him chocolates to get to my mom best
daughter of the Year award goes to me
it's probably really dangerous I'm just
holding this camera has a driving but
whatever anyways onto the makeup pretty
much looks the same I don't think is
getting any oilier or anything like that
I think it looks pretty good there's a
little bit of creasing around my mouth
if you can see
and that's about it so I guess I will
check in in a few hours okay okay so it
is now 8:03 p.m. this is what the makeup
looks like I wouldn't say it's any more
oily than my face usually is at this
point there definitely is well liked
comes off on my finger but like I said I
have really oily skin so if you have you
know normal to dry skin this probably
wouldn't make you oily I really like it
it's still covering all my acne but I
did take a nap and I sleep on this side
so that could be why I don't know I like
it I like the finish I like the lasting
power it's pretty good eight hours much
right
I've had it on for nine hours now let me
know down below if you guys like these
first impression videos this is my first
version first impressions video I've
ever done so things that you would like
to see differently or whatever so love
you guys miss you guys I'll be making
more videos very soon okay
thumbs up this video if you liked first
impression videos and if you want to see
more and also comment down below with
what products you want to see you next
