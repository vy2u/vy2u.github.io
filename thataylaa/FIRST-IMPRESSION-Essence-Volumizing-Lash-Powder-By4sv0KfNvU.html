that's the only news I have to report
all right so today we are talking about
the essence volumizing lashed out ur so
I was shopping around on Ulta for the
$15 to face sweetheart blush sale and I
came across this stuff and I was
extremely intrigued I've never seen a
lash powder before I've seen like the
fiber extension that type of thing but
this caught my eye and I was like holy
crap I need that on my eyeballs so I got
this at Ulta retails for 349 jiz super
reasonable so basically it comes in this
little box you get an applicator one and
then the powder which reminds me of like
a Mac pigment jar you apply your mascara
first then you go in with the one they
give you and a lash powder do a coat of
that and then apply your mascara again
and it says do not use this if you have
contact lenses so pre-warning they're
super weird consistency clumps together
almost like cotton in there I show you a
close-up in the demo literally weirdest
consistency I've ever seen the texture
kind of makes me want to eat a
marshmallow so now we will go into the
demo and after that I will tell you my
concluding thoughts so it says that
you're supposed to use your favorite
mascara first close your eyes and apply
powder with supplied powder brush aka
this guy and then reapply your mascara
so I'm very curious to see how you're
supposed to apply a powder well closing
your eyes so this is what the powder
looks like this isn't like anything I've
ever seen before this is super
interesting consistency I'm going to
apply my first coat of L'Oreal carbon
black and then we will apply the powder
let's do this
I don't even know how you're so still
800k and all that's coming out with the
brush I do not know how you're supposed
to get this well here is what the
brush looks like with the powdery stuff
on it things are like blowing everywhere
I don't know what's going on really
don't know how we're supposed to close
my eyes right now so let's just see what
happened whoa it's getting all over my
face I think I'm going to play on the
tops also to see what happens this is a
 disaster
okay I'm gonna wipe all this powdery
stuff off of my face
super weird consistency it reminds me of
lint that comes off with the dryer so
now that we have that on our eyeballs
I'm going to go ahead and do a second
coat of L'Oreal carbon black
I definitely feel like it's giving it
some volume but look at those chunks
people this is insane it kind of seems
like all of the powder is just clumping
up and like coming to the end of the
lashes I'm going to apply a little bit
more mascara just to see if we can even
things out
insane okay so I think this is as even
as I could get it clearly we have some
massive clumping going on
compared to this I definitely had some
more volume but you can see for yourself
okay so after I did that application I
wanted to make sure that I you know
tested it right so I went ahead and I
took off all that and I redid it I did
find that it was easier to apply the
second time it didn't turn out as clumpy
I think it definitely does give you some
volume as far as the ease of product
goes and kind of like the practicality I
don't really think this is like an
everyday kind of product as you saw it
got all over my face girls not trying to
get more white you know what I'm saying
when I apply mascara it's my last step
after I have foundation eyeshadow and
everything on so that doesn't sound very
appealing to me having to wipe it off
every time after you do your mascara I
probably would use this if I was just
doing a mascara only kind of day and
just wanted a little extra volume but I
definitely don't think it's like a
practical everyday product the
application is kind of weird you have to
stick the brush all the way down and
then when it comes out you get this like
plethora of powder everywhere I don't
even know if plethora was the right word
I think they could have done a little
better job instead of just sticking
powder in a jar I was looking back on
the Ulta reviews and it got 4.5 out of 5
stars on Ulta people are comparing this
to like getting lash extensions I didn't
see that great of results a lot of
people were complaining about how it
gets in your eye and it irritates your
eye if you have sensitive eyes and it
gets all over the place and it's just
not very clean I really don't think this
deserves 4.5 out of 5 stars I think
for $3.50 if you're curious about this
you might as well try it out it is very
interesting very interesting so if you
