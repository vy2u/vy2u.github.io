impressions on the Garnier BB cream this
is a combination to oily skin and I am
in the shade light to medium obviously
because I am pretty damn pale
right now I have self-tanner on so it
matched me really well but I definitely
think this would be too dark if I was
just wearing my bare skin they only have
three shades which is kind of downfall
but that's usually what happens with BB
creams this is the lightest light to
medium then they have medium deep and
then deep dark I believe these retail
for 1199 at Target you can get it on
sale at drugstores I also had a $2.00
off coupon so I use that so I got it for
cheaper it has SPF 20 in it and is 2.0
fluid ounces which is nice because you
don't need to apply a sunscreen or
anything like that
you got this bad boy says to reapply at
least every two hours which I'm just now
seeing so that's interesting so we'll
see how long this lasts I guys say when
I'm applying it I didn't apply a powder
because I just love the finish so much
so we'll see how it lasts it says that
it is supposed to instantly control
shine minimize pores even and hydrate
which I don't know about the minimizing
pore bit you can still see my pores but
they're not like emphasized or anything
but it definitely did all the other
things it feels feels not like
completely dry to the touch but that's
probably because I haven't had a long
long enough but doesn't feel oily at all
my skin feels really nice and I tap it
nothing comes off on my fingers alright
let's do this I've already moisturized
and primed my face the primer I used is
the Maybelline instant age rewind
primers my favorite primer if you get at
the drugstore so here is the bottle I
really am a fan of the golden s and this
is the combination to oily skin kind
which I've heard really good things
about the other one apparently sucks ass
I never tried it but it looks horrible
this one is a little more promising okay
so I'm just going to apply this with my
fingers
is I don't know I think that works best
and that's how I usually apply my
foundation anyways hold on let's shake
this a little bit sometimes the what
Ilyn the product goes to the top okay
round two so I'm just going to squirt
some out it's a little watery here than
I expected
I'm just going to dab this all over my
face
um I think the color is going to be okay
I did self tan last night so it'll
probably be a little bit better and if I
was just completely pale I'm just gonna
start rubbing it in I like the way it
feels it doesn't feel oily at all kind
just feels like the moisturizer I'm
using right now which is the Olay fresh
effects BB cream or BB cream fresh
effects moisturizer call me feels like
that um it has pretty good coverage for
a BB cream I like my full coverage so I
wouldn't wear a BB cream on its own
probably ever the color is actually
perfect right now to my body I hope it's
showing up true to color on there but
yeah it definitely has blurred some of
my imperfections you can still see all
of my freckles and everything I think
I'm going to do a second layer just to
see how buildable this is the second
layer I'm going to use a brush just to
see how it applies with a brush I'm
going to use the Sigma flat top kabuki
fabs my favorite foundation brush you've
probably heard it five thousand times
but it really is the bling for
Sigma will be down below if you want to
try it out but I'm just going to put
some on the back of my hand and then
just cover my brush in that bad boy whoa
I like the Oh this applies way better
with a brush Wow oh yeah
okay I like this five thousand times
better so far you can just see how
nicely this is going on this I would
wear like this you don't need a
foundation okay which is what I'm going
to do today because that's what a person
impressions video is all right so I'm
just going to I'm probably enough to get
more yeah I'm not rubbing because I
don't want to rub off what I already put
on I'm just kind of stippling it in
there oh I really like this with the
second layer looks good for a BB cream
 I was not expecting
honestly it to like this that much but I
actually really like it
I still feel mine cool
do the forehead
um okay I love this okay I don't even
know if it's showing up true to how
amazing it is on camera but it looks
like I don't even need a foundation it
looks really glowy it's definitely a
little bit dewy I really like the finish
of it especially because my skin has
been like in this weird transition phase
and it's actually getting dry now I
don't know if it's because we're going
into winter and whatnot why am I like
out of breath right now is that a
workout putting on makeup um but my skin
has been getting dry and this definitely
gives it the dewy finish so I really
like that I'm going to go ahead and
apply the rest of my makeup and then
I'll be back alright so I have applied
all of my makeup I am so happy with the
way this stuff looks I decided for once
in my life to not use a setting powder
so we'll see how it wears but honestly I
didn't even do it for that it just looks
so good on its own that I didn't want to
mess it up by putting a powder on top of
it but I did finish it with my Urban
Decay chill makeup setting spray just so
I don't get super super oily I use this
stuff every day I can't live without it
love it on my lips because I know I'm
going to get questions is the max creme
de nude lipstick so far I'm in love
we'll see how it wears throughout the
day I'm excited to see how long it lasts
because I'm obsessed
so far so right now it is a 1251 late
start
hejdå long night we will see how this
wears throughout the day and I'll see
you guys in a little bit hey guys um it
is now what time is it
2:58 so it's been about two hours right
wait
it looks great actually think it looks
better than it did when I first put it
on I just like how natural the finish
looks like I'm obviously not wearing
powder but it just looks so good
like I don't even know I'm in shock
because I was not expecting to like it
this much and I would use this as my
like daily foundation not getting too
oily it feels like really matte but it
still gives off the dewy finish I'll
check back in a couple hours
I'm just running errands and I just was
very successful at Goodwill so I'm very
happy I walk in to the craft store it's
sunny in like 70 degrees and now it is
pouring freaking Murray welcome to my
state I don't even think about longer
than the last time I checked it's been
like 45 minutes um but I just rant they
rain and my makeup is still on so I feel
like I should update you guys alright so
it is currently 951 I know the lighting
is horrible but honestly there's no good
lighting at this time of day maybe this
is better I can't see what you guys are
looking at but overall I am so happy
with the results of this BB cream I
can't even tell you just realize my name
of my college was on my sweatshirt so
I'm really happy with how it turned out
I definitely am more oily than when I
first put it on but nothing crazy and I
think if I powdered like once throughout
the day just with the empty powder brush
that it would take it all the way
thumbs-up for Garnier BB cream I'm
really happy I feel like this is going
to be one of my new favorite products I
am really loving these first impressions
videos if you guys couldn't tell I think
you guys are too because I brought a
good feedback but thumbs up if you like
this video if you like force impressions
videos and comment down below with what
you want the next first impression video
to be
and yeah okay
