long time no frickin see I'm currently
in a hotel in a disclosed location
driving up to school before we get
started really quick I just wanted to
say that I will be back in the routine
of filming weekly videos very soon I'm
moving back into my apartment this week
and I also wanted to give a huge huge
thank you to Shannon Janek so you are
freaking amazing she mentioned me in one
of her tag videos and I completely 100%
appreciate it if you are a new viewer
sent over by Shannon hello
welcome but right now I have a freaking
exciting video for you guys
I finally found these damn lip pencils
these have been out for a few weeks now
but I've been on a freaking manhunt to
find these things as you can tell from
the title her impressions video on the
L'Oreal new lipsticks I wish I were
joking when I say I went to about 10
different stores before I could find
these damn things I don't think I've
been this excited to try these out since
I had my first burrito back in America
and that's a big statement for me I
finally ended up finding them at Target
so if you're having issues finding them
I would suggest going to Target um I got
them for $7.99 there and they're
probably a lot cheaper at CVS or
rite-aid because you can get the buy one
and get one half off but I don't even
care I'm so excited these are not all of
the shades as you can see there's only
five most Museum you guys in a little
he's out of five shades I got I have two
of the limit and three of the blue
backer and I'm probably totally
butchering that French but I ain't
French this one I really want to try so
I'm gonna do this first shade 408 she is
so mad so they roll up like this oh is
that seriously all that Oh
I'm so excited okay I like forget how to
put on the lipstick I'm so damn excited
whoa whoa it feels super soft super soft
holy it feels like there's nothing
on your lips like at all usually matte
ones are kind of drying this doesn't
feel dry off just feels like there's
nothing on my lips
something smells like baby powder a
second matte shade I got is oh no matter
what okay so it is this dark brown shade
I have no idea how it's gonna look on my
skin tone but we will find out oh not
sure how I feel about this this isn't
nearly as pigmented and it kind of looks
like I'm smudging a light shade of
chocolate sauce on my lips it's like I
keep lathering it on and nothing's
really coming out and it looks like
someone literally melted or Hershey's
milk chocolate and then smudged it
across my lips so that doesn't no matter
what okay so now on to the little
lacquer
whoa
whoa-oh it feels really nice not sticky
you can feel it's definitely not like
the first matte one you can feel it but
it doesn't feel sticky whatsoever I like
the shape - it's a nice rosy pink
okay now the two that I am most looking
forward to trying out that's of a really
long decision process think I'm gonna go
with this one for just as the shape
let's say in the shade first this is
black Erised
oh my lord
holy cease okay this is super
pigmented you don't even need to put on
the top oh it smells really good I love
this one
this is amazeballs yeah I'm in love with
this that one's a keeper hold on I gotta
Instagram this one
alright so my last shade is looking new
glasses to read these laconic it's the
darker shade they had of the red one the
roller things are weird it's like you
have to do it five thousand times before
something comes up
holy balls I'm ready obsessed and
there's like one shape on my foot my
foot yeah my foot on my lip oh and I got
on me too
all right I am definitely this one is my
favorite for sure
look at it I feel like I don't even need
to say anything super pigmented
moisturizing like the other one
I'm obsessed so out of all these I
definitely have to say that the two
black gray lacquer eyes lack one black
whatever to shiny ass ones are my
favorite and then the other Matt the
matte red shade which is she so mad
these three are my favorite definitely
returning the chocolate Hershey kiss I
