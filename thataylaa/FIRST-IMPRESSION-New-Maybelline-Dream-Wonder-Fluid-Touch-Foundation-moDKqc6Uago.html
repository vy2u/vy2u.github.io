the Maybelline Dream wonder fluid touch
liquid foundation this is fairly recent
in the drugstore has probably been out
for about a month now I didn't think the
lightest shade was going to be light
enough which is why I was hesitant to
pick this up and I also just wanted to
wait till went on sale I got this for
40% off at Rite Aid drugstores switch
out the brands they put on sale so just
wait until Maybelline is buy one get one
free or 40% off the day will come I
promise it comes in a blast blast glass
bottle which I think is kind of pretty
classy for the drugstore personally I
think the packaging is kind of appealing
just a shape that you don't really see
ever what even is the shape who knows so
I'm on my Blaine's website right now and
this comes in twelve shades which is
pretty good for a drugstore foundation I
got the lightest shade clearly ten
porcelain ivory I think it definitely is
doable it's a tiny bit too dark but if
you blend it down your neck it's
definitely workable
I'm obviously wearing it right now so
you can see how it looks there is 0.67
fluid ounces in here which is a little
bit less than typical foundations and
this is super liquidy you can hear it
when you shake it it has SPF 20 in it
which I really like since I'm you know a
little unfair side over here if you're
going to be taking pictures or anything
like that probably won't be a good
foundation to wear since it does have
SPF in it and can cause a white cast so
just reading from their website it's
supposed to be a breakthrough texture
that kind of fuses your skin with your
makeup
impeccable yet undetectable quotes by
Maybelline it says it's supposed to be
medium to full coverage which I think is
really interesting because all the
videos I've seen have said that it's
like light to medium coverage for me I
definitely got it up to a medium
coverage I don't think this is full
coverage by any means and I don't think
you could get it to full coverage
because I did do a couple layers it
covered pretty much all of my acne and
things like that but it still looks like
my natural skin is like peeking through
you can still kind of see like freckles
and stuff on my forehead which I
actually real
like it's good because I can get that
coverage but I don't look like the cake
base so if you want to see how it
applies and you want to see my thoughts
on this and how it wears throughout the
day then you're in the right place if
you want to see a shadow and schmooze
video on the look I'm wearing right now
it will be up after this so make sure
you're subscribed so you don't miss out
all right looking a little funky right
now because we just have a brows on but
it's okay excuse the background noises
living in a city now also we keep
getting sporadic bits of thunder splash
the Blue Angels it's one of the two I
can't help so I've watched a couple
videos on this foundation the best way
seems to applies with a brush the sponge
tends to soak it up since it is so
liquidy and like hear it so the brush
I'm going to be using is the Sigma flat
top kabuki f80 this is hands-down my
favorite brush to apply liquid
foundation mine's a little bit dirty
right now but I just spot cleaned it
with my brush cleaner of a DIY
two-minute tutorial on how to make your
own brush cleaner worked super well and
it's just easy if you don't have time to
clean your brushes ain't nobody got time
for that so when you open it up it has
this weird like dripper thing so you can
either wait an hour for it to drop off
of the spatula thing or you could just
rub it directly onto the back of your
hand or on your face I personally don't
want to put it on my face because since
I do have some acne going on I don't
want to get bacteria on a spatula and
then put it back into the bottle
contaminating everything I don't know
how much we need for this so I'm just
going to go in with my kabuki brush and
stipple it and then apply it to the face
it feels like nothing going on feel like
I'm just rubbing a brush on my face
so that is one layer it actually has a
lot better coverage than I was expecting
it kind of evens out my skin tone and it
did cover up some of the acne but my
skin is still showing through just good
if you want a more natural look but you
still want your problem areas to kind of
be blurred out I'm going to go ahead and
do the same amount on the rest of my
face and then it will go back in for a
second layer and see if you can build
this thing up alright so this is what it
looks like with a first layer on I am
using a pretty generous amount on the
back of my hand every time I think that
did help to cover it a little bit more I
don't think is a super buildable
coverage but it did help a little bit I
would say I don't know what do you guys
think when I apply a second layer of
foundation I usually like to press it
into my face rather than blending it
because we don't want to rub around what
we just put on my natural skin is
showing through you can still see
freckles around my nose and it feels
really nice like it feels super light
it's lighter than a moisturizer and a BB
cream I've never really tried anything
similar to it I have pretty large pores
around my nose and it looks super nice
looks good so I'm going to go ahead and
apply the rest of my makeup and I'll be
right back
smells like my biscuits are burning yeah
they definitely some biscuits look like
baked pancakes don't ask me how I
managed to up ready to bake this
quick it's a skill so I've got the rest
of my makeup on I have a shadow mousse
video coming up next on this look right
now it is 12:35 getting a little bit of
a late start so I will check back in a
few hours and we'll see how the
foundation is looking
all right so it is now 3:30 so it's been
about three hours with the makeup on
almost just died in our hundred-year-old
elevator I'm pretty sure that that was
literally the first elevator that was
ever installed in Seattle anyways the
makeup looks amazing I am so pleasantly
surprised by this product my skin just
looks like skin but I still get coverage
the only thing is it starting to crease
a little bit around my nose which I
don't usually get right there I tend to
get like lines right here so far I'm not
getting oily or anything like that and
it just looks super good so I'm going to
go pick up Rach from work and we're
going to go run some errands we're going
to Target and then we're going to go get
the keys for our new apartment so I'm
super excited
I hope the lighting stays good right it
is a what time is at 10 o'clock 10
o'clock looks pretty good
what do you think flawless bloodless
it's kind of creasing around my nose a
little bit that's about it I've had it
on for pretty much find a hat for 10
hours right now I actually really really
like it and I'm pleasantly surprised but
we are going to go so be sure to thumbs
