very first I shouldn't answer type thing
I've ever done I think ever pretty much
since I've been on YouTube I'm answering
questions that you guys asked me on my
Instagram and Twitter so if you're not
following those then go do that so you
can participate in the fun next time
sorry I've been ma the past few days
this week has been midterms for me and
it was literally hell I'm finally a
normal human being again and can like
eat sleep poop and do laundry and normal
people things so that's great if you're
wondering the glasses I am wearing are
from glasses shop calm and feeling she's
got really amazingly super cheap
inexpensive cute lashes lashes glasses
and you know that it's the end of
midterm week I also have the coupon code
which is in the downbar all of the model
numbers and everything of the glasses
that I have are down below yes I still
have the Christmas tree in the
background it is February and I'm Jewish
okay so like I said I'm just going to be
reading them off of my Instagram
questions let's just start at the
beginning
sheer 101 one asked who is your favorite
band or musician I feel like I don't
really have one specific person I would
probably say above and beyond which is
like a progressive house band or
Matisyahu he has a long beard he's cool
and I like a lot of different music okay
what's your favorite drugstore
foundation guys from a smelly 24
favorite drugstore foundation would
probably be maybelline superstay yes I
think that's my all-time favorite
foundation what do you do when you're
bored I usually eat burritos that's
pretty much it really though what do I
do in my bored I'm not really bored that
often because I am a full-time college
student I have a job and I make youtube
videos so it's not much room for being
bored in there but when I am bored any
burritos favorite brushes you recommend
that you can get at drugstores or
Walmart etc favorite brushes that you
can get for cheap basically I'm assuming
this what you want is Real Techniques
brushes I would say they're super cheap
really good quality you
get them or no you can't get them on
Walmart and you can also get them on
Amazon those are being my favorite cheap
brushes also elf makes some really good
brushes ii says samaria asked how did
you go about applying at mac did you
just walk into a store or counter and
ask for an application or something i'm
going to be making a whole other video

second sub-area
again I think yes asked once you strange
it strangest phobia my strangest phobia
would probably be time I have this like
weird fear of time just that it goes by
too fast and I'm not doing enough with
my time like when I look back on the
last few months I and I feel like I
haven't done enough with my life or like
accomplished enough stuff not like
accomplished enough it's just like done
things so I can look up back on that
time and be like oh yeah I actually did
 yes that's my biggest phobia is
like looking back and not being happy
with how I spend my time foxtail
underscore asked if you could eat one
food for the rest of your life what
would it be burritos if you know
anything about me
it's burritos they are the best thing
ever invented period
Heather Elizabeth 1:21 asks would you
rather be able to say that you rode on
an alligator without a scratch or
wrestled a shark without a bite I would
probably rather be able to say that I
wrestled a shark without a bite because
I think I would give myself a heart
attack if I even saw a shark so Duffy
you know cool to look through the
unexperienced

choice of keeping your face young
forever or your body young forever which
would you choose

forever you know your body you can cover
up in big clothes your face you can

ah it's Kelso asked why is Arabic
interesting to you I got interested in
Arabic initially because as you know I'm
Jewish I lived in Israel in high school
for a semester I did like a study abroad
thing and I just kind of got really
interested in the israeli-palestinian
conflict from there I wanted to kind of
understand the other side more and learn
Arabic and learn about Arab culture and
I've fallen in love with it those are
