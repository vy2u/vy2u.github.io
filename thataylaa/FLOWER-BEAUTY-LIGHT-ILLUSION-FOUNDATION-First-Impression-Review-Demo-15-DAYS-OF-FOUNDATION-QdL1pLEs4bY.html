foundation this is where I try out a new
foundation every single day for 15 days
days 1 through 7 are linked down below
in the 15 days of foundation season 5
playlist but today we're trying out a
new drugstore foundation I got this at
Ulta this is the flower Beauty light
illusion foundation if you've never
heard of flower beauty it's Drew
Barrymore's makeup line I think it was
originally in Walmart and now they're on
oldest doors we're switching off
drugstore and high-end every single day
so today is drugstore day yesterday we
did the iliad new Sephora brand
foundation I have the lightest shade
porcelain L one this has one fluid ounce
of product in it and it retails for
$13.99 says it's a perfecting veil of
buildable coverage ok this description
is like when you're trying to use too
many fancy words let's just get to the
point here
long story short says it'll give you a
flawless smooth and incredibly natural
complexion the bottle says it has a
luminous finish it has SPF 18 and this
comes in 12 shades the lightest shade is
porcelain L one I do have the two
lightest shades because I just kind of
wanted to see them the next up shade is
ivory L 2 so I'm gonna do swatches of
these two shades so you can see how they
compare to some of the other foundation
say on let's do some swatch action right
here's the flower beauty light illusion
foundation in the lightest shade L 1
porcelain next over is the same
foundation in L 2 ivory cover FX power
play Foundation and n20 which I just did
a review on a NARS radiant foundation in
mont blanc CYO lifeproof in lighter
shade 101 Dermer called 2:08 and
maybelline fit me matte and poreless in
110 packaging I think is beautiful it
has a glass bottle it has a pump and I'm
all about the rose gold little touches
on here very nice flower beauty very
nice if you've been enjoying this series
so far and you're excited for day 8
don't forget to give this video a thumbs
up if you're new here you can join the
BAE radio family and
I'm uploading every single day from now
until the 29th flower beauty light
illusion foundation here we go okay so
it's a 943 in the morning I just totally
lost my train of thought I've already
washed moisturize prepped my skin I am
very excited for this one I think I've
said this every single day but this
foundation kind of reminds me just the
whole vibe of this of the covergirl
vitalist healthy foundation which I love
it's just too dark but I have a whole
video on that so their new concealer I
actually tried it last night and off of
first impressions I am obsessed with
this it's too dark so I had to lighten
it with powder but the formula of it was
beautiful so I think I'm gonna put that
on today just so you guys can see it too
I'm not gonna bring it like down into
here I'm just gonna put it right under
my eyes so it doesn't alter the
foundation at all this has SPF 18 in it
why do the brands always do that why
can't just make it 20 there's something
with 18 it looks thicker than I was
picturing it's like staying there so
half my face with a sponge and then half
my face with a foundation brush like
usual I can find it okay a little bit
goes a long way so I'm gonna bring this
up to the forehead oh it feels a lot
more jell jelly than I thought boom okay
it looks really nice on my forehead up
here it has a little bit of tackiness to
it like it does feel like a gel
foundation the shade is looking a little
bit off you can see the line right here
on my neck definitely more in real life
than you can see on camera right now but
it's wearable it's a tiny bit dark but
it's sitting on my skin beautifully I
love the glow that looks bum the brush I
got about medium coverage I can still
see stuff coming through let's go in
with a sponge oh yeah oh yeah I like the
way that this feels on my skin it feels
moisturizing and it doesn't feel like
it's gonna slide around getting a tiny
bit lighter coverage for sure on the
sponge side but it looks really pretty
with a sponge looks pretty with a brush
too hell yeah this is looking beautiful
doesn't look clingy and weird on the
center of my forehead between my
eyebrows looks great up here looks
right on my dryness around my mouth so
far I'm liking this a lot have a tiny
bit left over so I'm gonna try and study
problems I'm gonna try and build this up
right here on my scarring area so I can
see if we can cover this a little bit
more I think you could use a brush or a
sponge with this one you're just gonna
get a little bit more coverage with a
brush okay that built didn't build up to
full coverage but it definitely does
build a little bit I'm loving how this
looks right now I'm very excited all
right I really hope this doesn't oxidize
because it's already a little bit dark
everything else about this I have no
complaints right now this is looking
beautiful on the skin very glowy very
dewy but it's not clinging anywhere this
is definitely a foundation that you
would have to set because it's very
tacky very sticky I'm not gonna set my
forehead I'm just gonna set this area of
my face but first let's go in with the
concealer so you guys can see how it
works because I'm Aiman loves so this is
the lightest shade and it's obviously
darker than my face right now which is
interesting I don't know why they would
come out with a foundation line that
goes with this but make the concealer
darker than the lightest shade of the
foundation doesn't really make sense
this is so creamy but has the coverage
and it doesn't like just blend away
haven't tried it with a sponge yet last
night I used my brush that I usually use
with concealer okay I definitely liked
it better with the brush
brush is the way to go with this one it
just looks so moisturized under there it
doesn't make my under eyes look dry and
crepey but I'm gonna do the rest of my
makeup right now it's 956 so it'll be
back in a few minutes it's now 1022
we're gonna call a check-in time ten
o'clock give or take a few minutes
that's about when I finished up with my
face makeup I just did super super basic
makeup today cuz I just have to run
errands we go to the post office
exciting things I did set this part of
my face everything blended out
beautifully on top it is looking
gorgeous
even when I'm up close up close like
staring at every pore and stuff on my
face I think it looks really great if
pores are on my nose I would use the
Revlon pore filling primer with this one
just because it is more luminous it's
naturally gonna emphasize them a little
bit so it would use that primer next
time but it doesn't seem to be creasing
anywhere yet
it looks just really great I think it
has a beautiful skin like finish to it
my forehead is quite dewy I don't mind
that I really like this kind of finish
on my skin right now if you're more of a
matte person you could always set this
with a matte powder or something so I'm
going to show you guys what this looks
like in natural lighting and then we'll
do a little flash test so here's what
we've got going on in natural light I
think it looks so freakin pretty I love
the way this is sitting on my skin
especially on my forehead just has such
a pretty kind of natural look to it but
still you have makeup on you know what
I'm saying I think I think you can know
the camera keeps like auto adjusting but
I think you can see the shade difference
here between my neck and my face it
doesn't look too off but it definitely
is darker where's the phone let's do a
flash test okay I look half asleep but
it looks pretty good on flash there's
not too much of a flashback obviously
right on the center of my forehead looks
a little shiny from the flash but as far
as the shade it doesn't look too bad for
having SPF in it by the way have on my
all the way up t-shirt today this is for
Project Beauty share the link for
t-shirts will be down below rep in a
different region today but I love this
shirt and also daily reminder to vote
down below at the link it takes 10
seconds super quick vote for the shelter
that you want to win $5,000 and I'm
gonna be
to meet up in that city by the way the
concealer I get creasing like this with
almost every concealer put on my under
eyes I do feel like it's a little bit
more creasing than usual so I'm going to
try and play around with different
powders with this one but there's
something about this concealer that is
so freakin beautiful if you have dry
under eyes I think you might like this a
lot I just need to come out with about
ten more shades so on the rest of my
face for a contour use the Kevin Daquan
celestial bronzing veil I just go in
with this light section right here joy
adore blush duo use this shade throwing
it back today with one of my all-time
favorite products of all time all time
favorite products of all time this is
the Physicians Formula and natural nude
shimmer brick I just go in with the
lightest shades right here in this
corner as a highlight and this is one of
the most gorgeous highlighters ever
created nothing exciting on the makeup
today I just use my normal mascaras
which will be linked down below and then
for lips I use the bare minerals Gen
nude in bay and then I topped it off
with the vivid hot lacquer maybelline in
tees so check in times 10 o'clock
I'll see you has this happened in every
single video I'll see you guys in a few
hours in natural lighting
now 312 so it's been on for over five
hours I ran errands and then somehow
ended up in t.j.maxx story of my life so
I actually got a clip in the store in
the dressing rooms because I wanted you
guys to kind of see how it looks like in
that lighting and I did notice every
single time I passed a mirror in the
store the shade is very off for some
reason right now in this lighting it
looks totally fine on camera so it would
mix this one with another foundation or
a white mixer to lighten it next time I
wear it again it looks totally fine on
camera so as far as the finish and
everything is to definitely want if you
have oily skin you would want to set but
I don't mind the glow at all I feel like
I'm still nice and hydrated I don't look
dry anywhere I love the way it's still
sitting on my forehead it doesn't seem
to be creasing on my upper lip and
around my mouth on my dryness looks
really good with this one compared to
the past few days so I'm gonna check
back in with you guys at the end of the
night it's now 807 so it's been on for
over 10 hours at this point I just
worked out I didn't like break a major
sweat I just had to get the workout in
today so I just walked for like an hour
but I looked in the gym mirror and then
I looked when I got home and it looks
good it looks like skin it hasn't gotten
oily but it still has a nice glow to it
it has increased at all on my upper lip
which is very rare for me I'm gonna zoom
in I mean there is not a single crease
on my upper lip that I can see around
here there's a tiny tiny bit but not
nearly as bad as the past few days have
been at the end of the night yeah not
bad at all on that side I love the way
this makes my forehead look I think this
is one that I could just use a tiny bit
if I wanted to cancel out some of the
redness and it wouldn't look super
makeup B but also I could do like a full
face and get coverage and everything I
am feeling this flower beauty please
come out with more shades of this and
more shades and concealer I think if you
have dry skin you will love this I think
if you have oily skin you will
definitely have to set this but it
hasn't broken down at all which is a
good sign I think this one will probably
do really well on mature skin since it
didn't settle in anywhere it didn't
settle into my lineup there at all so
I'm excited about this one this one so
far I think is the front-runner for sure
there hope you guys enjoyed this video
