after seeing an Instagram video alright
so today it is day 8 of 15 days of
foundation it's feeling like day 8 if
you've missed any days 1 through 7 our
link down below in the description box
in a playlist so this foundation I am
super curious about this is the
Elizabeth Arden flawless finish mousse
makeup a mousse makeup let's just let
that sink in is that not the most
exciting thing you for Adele did I saw
this go pretty much viral on Instagram
those Instagram videos get you every day
I haven't tried a mousse foundation
quite like this where you would
literally spray it out let's head to
Macy's Andreessen the claims you can get
this on Elizabeth Arden's website or on
Macy's when I got this Macy's was having
like 15% off all makeup sale and I also
used be Bates to get cashback not
sponsored by you base they're just
amazing I use them every time I shop
online I'll leave a link for both those
down below with retails for $35 but you
get one point four ounces of product
which is actually quite a bit of product
staring foundation is one fluid ounce
this I think might be the most brief
description I've ever seen all it says
is the light airy cloud of color
provides just enough coverage for a
beautiful complexion while giving the
skin and naturally light feeling natural
finish great for weekends and makeup
minimalist this comes in 12 colors on
Macy's website this was actually really
difficult to figure out the lightest
shades no numbers on the actual shades
online and you can't find a whole lot of
swatches or information on the shade
range and they're all kind of out of
order I finally figured out the lightest
shade is 0-1 sparkling blush again it
doesn't say 0-1 online it just says
sparkling blush
alright so swatch time right here is the
Elizabeth Arden mousse foundation in the
shade 0-1 sparkling blush I mean yeah I
think this is probably one of the darker
lighter shades I've ever seen it's all
so very almost red toned next over is
estee lauder double wear in 1c0 laura
geller cover lock foundation that i
revision day to in the lightest shade
Urban Decay Naked Skin Foundation in 0.5
derma call to 0-8 and Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless in 110 if you're new
you can join the bae Rito family and
subscribe new foundation videos are
going up every single day for 15 days at
6 p.m. Pacific time if you've been
enjoying 50 days of foundation don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up if
you want to see my thoughts on the
Elizabeth Arden flawless finish mousse
makeup and how to apply somewhere
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching I'm definitely
coming down with something
throat's sore achy the whole nine yards
but we're doing this so I've already
washed moisturized and primed my face
use the Laura Mercier foundation primer
I'm going try out the Real Techniques
sponge on one side and then my morphe
e31 on the others as I said in my face
I'm so curious about this this is like
secured shut so it looks like a mini dry
shampoo bottle their packaging always
looks a little bit outdated to me so
let's shake this so I'm super liquidy it
sounds a little bit like whipped cream
or when you shake it it starts to get a
little bit more solid yeah it's
definitely getting more solid arm
workout 2 &amp;amp; 1 alright here we go
get it close for this I'm so excited oh
that is not as exciting as I was
anticipating oh it's kind of getting
bigger there we go so it definitely
expands on there this is so wild it's
not really moving just have our shit
smells kind of good whoa sounds like a
unless I was smelling my candle lid it's
a possibility
oh yeah definitely smelling the candle
lid thing I'm just going to go start
with a brush on this side and I'm just
going to dip it and then kind of stipple
it on oh my god this is so weird
feels like a science project what was it
shade just looked in a pretty dark whoa
as better much better coverage and I was
anticipating actually I feel like I did
just use a lot though
super lightweight it feels very
moisturizing though it doesn't feel
quite as moosie at all as the Maybelline
Dream matte mousse
nation which I did on day one of the
days put it and I over here and down
below
it looks really smooth on my skin right
now not covering my acne down here but
it definitely helped to even out my skin
tone I'm going to drag this pretty much
all the way down my neck since it is
pretty dark it feels a little bit
cooling which I like Foundation
definitely doesn't smell goes a candle
is hard to see the shade in this
lighting but couple shades too dark so
lightest shade is probably good for one
or two skin tones darker than I am so
let's try a sponge on a side just to see
how it applies do the same thing and
just dip it in then stipple I'm
definitely getting lighter coverage with
the sponge I almost feel like it just
kind of soaking into the sponge a little
bit with the sponge I would say it's
light coverage on this side with the
brush low medium coverage even on the
part so I don't have acne and stuff you
can still see my skin coming through and
freckles but that's what it's supposed
to be it's supposed to be more natural
coverage and just minimal makeup so for
that if I didn't have a bunch of stuff
to cover up it does look nice it almost
looks like a tinted moisturizer the way
it's sitting on my skin you can't see
any kind of foundation texture at all so
I'm going to see if this thing is
buildable it does feel like it's setting
a little bit for a second layer when you
go in with the brush it dries down a
little bit on the quick side not where
it's super difficult to work with or
anything but you probably don't want to
put it all on your face at one time I
don't know if we got a whole lot more
coverage it looks a little tiny bit more
Foundation Eon the second layer so it
does build but I would say it doesn't go
past about solid medium coverage bring
in this all the way down so it's
obviously quite luminous but it has just
kind of a healthy glow to it on certain
parts of my face you can just see the
foundation a little bit more on the
second layer but overall it still looks
very smooth and just kind of like skin
okay so here's what it looks like I mean
I feel like I'm I feel look very nice
and smooth
you can still see acne scarring and acne
coming through down here center of my
forehead looks pretty good
yeah we're all right now I think it
looks nice right now it is 9:30 I
probably am going to set my face with a
powder with this one just
because I'm very luminous right now and
I feel like I might get oily with this
and also I want to see if I can lighten
it a little bit with powder so I'm going
to apply the rest of my makeup and I'll
be right back all right so it's exactly
ten o'clock my wing today got so intense
there was no stop in it so I ended up
setting my whole face with the Laura
Geller double take baked powder
foundations this is one of the powders
that I usually use to set my face and
that definitely modified things as you
can see there's a tiny bit of the
luminosity coming through but when I
looked in the bathroom err it looks
pretty much totally matte the powder on
top of it is sitting okay I would say it
for sure looked more skin like without
the powder and I think the powder did
add a bit of coverage to my face looks
pretty much full coverage right now so
on the rest of my face is the Catrice
prime and fine contouring palette the
Physicians Formula butter blush in the
shade natural glow how it was the
Physicians Formula bronze booster I
forgot how intense this white shade is
it is very very pigmented you need like
a DAB I just want a super basic on the
eye shadow I used a couple color pop
shades made to last and then Firefly
eyeliner use the LFR eye liquid liner
this is a dollar-fifty from Daiso I did
a whole die so first impressions video
and the lips too faced melted matte in
cool girl
so I'm going to go take a shit to the
vitamins and hope that we can make it to
a final check-in today the next second
idea will be a natural lighting so I
will see you guys in few hours I think I
have the world's biggest button going
down right now
okay so stuff 303 so the Foundation's
been on for five hours as the hiccups
right now see another one coming so
right now I think it just looks very
average to me it just looks a little bit
heavy definitely liked it better without
the powder on with this powder is just
looking a little foundation you to me
doesn't look bad at all it just looks
kind of average I think it looks nice
right now it just isn't totally wowing
me could just been the powder that I put
on top of this but it's that patter
usually doesn't look really heavy at all
getting a little bit of weirdness around
here
I didn't bring my concealer all the way
down and try not to in these videos so
that doesn't affect around my nose and I
am getting a little bit of weird dry
something going on right there trying to
get accurate lighting for the shade and
it's not really showing up it looks like
it matches fine in the viewfinder but in
real life
I'm looking pretty Orange so I'm going
to eat lunch
I need a lunch three o'clock I'll check
back in with you guys at the end of the
night okay so it's 746 so the
Foundation's been on for almost ten
hours I desperately need to wash and
blow-dry my hair right now so I'm
cheating by 15 minutes so it has totally
oxidized probably within the last I want
to say four hours is when I really
noticed it after the last check-in which
is weird I feel like normally if
foundation is going to oxidize it
typically does it in the first few hours
but this one just completely darkened a
couple shades in the last two hours so
I'm definitely looking pretty oily for
having powder knit my chin is oily my
forehead oily if I'm looking this oily
with a powder on I can only imagine how
oily I would be right now if I didn't
set my face but also the initial
application I did like how it looked
without the powder way better so say if
you have dry or normal skin you might
like this if you don't have to set it
with a powder like I said super pretty
spin kind of dewy natural look to it so
if you don't get oily this one could be
good for the summer or if you just like
a really glowy kind of look I don't see
myself reaching for this one again
because the shade is so off and I would
have to mix it in I don't know how
mixing that kind of formula and what the
foundation was worth but I'm going to
try it for me this one's a no just
because of what I look for my skin type
but I don't think the actual product as
bad I think this product could work for
a certain type of person I'm just not
that person I'm so excited to get a
shower right now
I just ate two bowls of cereal for
dinner adulting so if you guys like this
video and you're excited for tomorrow
don't forget to give it a thumbs up love
you guys thanks for watching see you
tomorrow right
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
