Ranchers
all right so today we're trying out
forever21
makeup makeup has been on forever 21 for
I feel like a few years now but I had no
idea no idea how many different brands
and stuff they carried now for this
video I'm sticking to the forever 21
brand so they carry other brands but
then they also have their own line of
makeup and I thought it would be fun to
try out that stuff instead because you
can get the other makeup other places so
I did pretty much a full face with
forever 21 makeup so if you're excited
for this video don't forget to give this
a thumbs up by the way I have videos
testing out Claire's makeup Dollar Tree
makeup 7-eleven makeup I'll link all
those down below if you're new here you
can join the baby arrow family and
subscribe I upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. save time
alright here we go putting forever 21
makeup on my face if you want to see how
I got this look you're in the right
place just keep watching I've already
washed my face and I just moisturized I
have a zit on my lip right now literally
on it so I have a face primer here to
try check out this packaging 10 out of
10 for the pun down here so this primer
was six dollars and ninety cents looks
like as a silicone primer at Houzz
dimethicone as the third ingredient
those typically break me out but do it
for the video I just put on a perfume
sample what was this Gucci flora that
Shay is strong have this seven dollar
primer seal oh my god so just twists
right off of there
woah okay so it's totally clear yep
definitely definitely a silicon primer
so I'm just gonna apply this see if it
smooths out the pores at all it feels
exactly like the maybelline baby skin
feels very soft but almost Gracie
I personally I'm not a fan of the
Maybelline one definitely did a little
something to the center of my forehead
so I'm gonna let that primer set in for
a couple minutes and we're gonna talk
about this bunch I couldn't not buy this
this sponge was $2.90 I'm really in to
this packaging they have a few things
that were in this almost like milk
makeup or Pat McGrath bag packaging so
you could totally reuse these bags if
you're traveling or something if there's
something small oh this is weird
I don't know why this is grossing me out
that you can feel the ridges between
each color
well definitely feel squishier than a
lot of the sponges I've tried recently
which wanted to just try no video the
7-eleven one it's one definitely feels
softer I'm gonna go wet this I
definitely got pretty big I mean it's
like the size of my eyebrow to my lip
pretty large it feels pretty squishy so
I'm excited to try this
so Foundation was one of the few things
that I could not find I placed this
order for you weeks ago so I'm trying to
remember what the situation was with the
foundation but I know there weren't any
shades even remotely close to my skin
tone the closest one I could find
was not a forever 21 brand it was by
Lottie London the selfie one selfie
London selfie ready foundation this is
actually not their lightest shade this
isn't a shade pale toffee so I think
this is still gonna be probably too dark
I think it was like the second eye third
lightest shade you can get this on Ulta
so I think I'm actually gonna save this
for a foundation Friday video but I'm
gonna get the lightest shade on Ulta all
the other foundations it was like two or
three shades in each Foundation and just
none of them seems like they were gonna
work for my skin tone so I'm gonna go
with the covergirl Ready Set gorgeous
foundation 105 cannot remember if I have
to mix this one but this is almost out I
haven't used this in a while
we're gonna do one half of my face with
a sponge and then the other half with a
brush this is like such a crunchy
feeling actually that primer feels like
it set into my skin nicely doesn't feel
quite as slippery blister on this side
with a sponge seems to be soaking up
quite a bit put out a quarter-sized
amount and that Sardi all gone I'm gonna
try the side of the sponge instead to
the bottom and see but that's kind of
doing that thing that some sponges do
where it just like stamps it instead of
actually blending it in like you can see
the marks mmm not feeling it not feeling
it this is soaking up a ton of product
I'm gonna do what word was that so
before I do my forehead I'm gonna go in
on the other side and use this elf
ultimate blending brush and see if the
coverage and everything is any different
yeah getting a bit better coverage on
the brush side for sure I'm gonna try
and kind of build this up a little bit
more with the sponge again do you see
that I don't know if you guys know I
don't know if you can okay right there
see that line right there
it kind of just removes the foundation
as far as the primer I don't really
think it did anything around this area
but my forehead does look really smooth
so for concealer I believe the only one
that they had from the forever 21 line
was the concealer duo look at that
marble so has a stick concealer one side
that says for dark spots freckles bla
bla and then down here has a brush
applicator I'm gonna start out with the
under eye so I'm gonna use the brush
applicator first and it looks like a
nice paddle this looks exactly like the
Urban Decay Naked skin paddle I actually
have it right here
let's compare these two wands yeah this
looks almost identical so here's the two
wands it has that like flattened paddle
kind of one I really like the applicator
of the Urban Decay Naked but let's see
when I first go ahead and blend it out
with a brush on this side what is
happening okay I'm gonna try and try and
finish blending this out and then I'm
gonna get real up close I look like I am
literally 95 underneath my eyeball
okay I'm gonna try and blend this out
with my finger I don't know why I'm
using my second finger right now so
that's smoothing out some of the weird
whatever just happened but I mean that's
like pretty much the same as the other
eye so didn't really do a whole lot and
add a little bit more and blend this out
with my finger instead maybe the brush
was the problem nope something super
weird is going on with this concealer I
don't think I've had a concealer look
this bad since what video was it was it
the hit end might have been the hidden
drugstore video wow that was pretty
horrible how much was this thing that
was four dollars and ninety cents save
your five bucks let's try the stick side
underneath the eyes because it really
can't get worse than that
this one looks lighter for sure I'm
gonna try the brush first again because
that's how I usually like to blend out
my concealer okay that side is not bad
at all sitting pretty well under there
so that's how much concealer you get I
don't know how quickly you would go
through that and endued on the other
side it has a little bit of a tug to it
not to where it's uncomfortable but it
doesn't seem to be look melting away so
I don't know how long this would last
you but I don't think it would totally
disappear in two days
here's how this blends on top of the
other thing much better than before this
side stills not looking too hot this
side definitely looks a little much
better this side is pure this side
not too bad so I have this face palette
that I got for contouring bronzer mostly
it has this shade right here I'm not
sure
this has shimmer in it almost looks like
it does but I'm wondering if I could use
that to set my under eyes I'm gonna take
it out of here and see this face palette
was six ornate six dollars ninety cents
mmm that might work as like an all-over
powder I don't know let's try it for the
under eyes Oh nope definitely more of an
all-over face powder for me that just
made this side look white heavy under
there don't like that as an under eye
putter to lighten it up I'm gonna use my
usual Physicians Formula powder lately
I've been setting just this part of my
face just so it's easier to blend powder
products on top so I'm gonna use that
same middle shade in the palette now you
try it for under my eyes and just set my
cheek area it's almost getting like a
little bit patchy in some areas
dude this side looks so not good so for
eyebrows I was planning on doing this
this is a brow tattoo but then I read
the back and it says it lasts for three
to seven days long I leave for a year up
in two days so I don't really want to be
having drinkie eyebrows on for the trip
I also have to let this set for two
hours think this is a Korean product
I've been seeing a lot of these brow a
two kind of things lately whoa it's like
a jelly I still want to try this at some
point let me know if you guys ever want
to see a separate video testing this
thing out but that was what I spent 18
bucks on this thing we're definitely
gonna be trying it out now so I'm gonna
do my brows really quick but first I'm
just priming my eyes with Mac's Paint
Pot they actually did not have an eye
primer on they're from their brand okay
I threw some brows on so let's go back
into the contour palette this is a
corner shade that one looks quite
oranjee here's this shade oh I like that
one okay we're gonna go in with that one
why did I even put perfume on I'm going
to bed in like two hours
it's like 9 p.m. when I'm filming this
so again I'm taking this shade right
here there's something a little bit
patchy about these powders it's looking
a lot better on camera I don't love the
tone of this or how it looks on my skin
in real life I actually want to try and
take the deepest shade in the middle on
more of a contour brush and just
define a little bit does not look bad
I'm just not like and then what do they
do up they're very excited to try this
blush this is their ombre blush this
looks exactly like that essence one this
is in the shade coral and this was 590
dirty packaging I was really curious
what those machines would look like the
things that actually packaged products
okay so it looks like there's a little
bit of a shimmer in here which I really
enjoy and blushes usually I'm gonna
swirl and see what it looks like it's
like a nice pink shade and then here's
just the coral one very light coral and
then here's the deepest pink side that's
bright okay I'm just gonna mix him on a
brush obviously whoa that was very very
powdery you can see the dark shade kind
of sticking right there I'm gonna go
ahead and give it a little tap
oh it definitely gave a little bit of a
glow almost looks like I have a
highlighter on I like the shade of that
it's very powdery when I first went to
put it on my face you definitely get
some powder flying up like the putters
have almost fallen down or something all
right so this highlight looks very
similar to two products that are already
out there looks really similar to my
favorite makeup revolution highlight the
goddess love which was kind of a dupe of
the two-faced product like this and this
was 690 so I'm gonna go in with this
light white shade right here
mmm definitely emphasizing my texture
you can see everything right here I'm
not the most flattering I'm gonna try
that middle shade for my nose I like
there's definitely chunks of glitter in
there which isn't really my thing
some people really enjoy that in a high
light okay don't particularly like it
don't hate it kind of the theme so far
before we go in for eyeshadow I'm gonna
use just the pixie fixing mist I don't
think they had a setting spray I didn't
see one by the forever 21 brand oh god
oh god that just went in my ear where's
another one I don't do this one I said I
haven't used this in a long time this is
the insta ready by physicians format
okay now this I don't feel at all so the
side with the pixie the highlight is
definitely popping more now so when I
was looking online I came across two
eyes shadow products that I am really
excited to try I think these are what I
most aside try from the forever 21 line
this looks really similar I'd like
layout wise to the pixie palette this
was eight dollars and ninety cents looks
like there's some nice more cool tone
shades and then you have a nice warm
brown and then a shimmer ooh that red
that looks pretty felt super soft the
mats are a bit stiff that was definitely
with a good rub think I want to use the
mats out of that palette and then I got
the second thing that I am so excited to
try does this look familiar to anyone
this looks pretty similar to the
hourglass product that palette they came
out with in ghost last year look at that
that is so visually appealing this one
was six dollars ninety cents oh that
felt pretty rough that feels very rough
once you rub it though I mean that looks
pretty I'm definitely pressing pretty
hard and rubbing quite a few times ooh
that one looks pretty I don't know what
kind of look I'm gonna be going for it
do I ever know what look I'm going for
looks like I just ate hot cheetos don't
know why that went pink but I'm start
out with this palette so let's go in
with this sure you'd right there
so I finally got rid of the Christmas
tree we're back to the bush this video
is actually gonna be going up I think
before a few others that are pre filmed
that still have the Christmas tree but
you know we can keep the keep the
holiday spirit going on a little longer
and I'm gonna keep the hanging lights up
I feel like it adds a nice ambience to
the background let's take this brown
shade right here well these are the kind
of eye shadows that you really gotta
touch lightly because they just kind of
move actually you're just gonna take my
finger what's up with you guys well
right now when I've told me this it's
Jan no it's December 31st no it's
December 30th
I haven't obviously left from my trip
yet but I'm excited to film a shout out
amazed when I get back and just catch
you guys up on everything we're just
gonna have a chat I think I'm gonna do
these cooler tone Browns let's take the
deeper one first I'm gonna take my
finger and then put that kind of on the
middle and I think we're gonna put that
lighter brown towards the center doesn't
look very metallic I'm gonna take this
shade whoo that one's pretty still
doesn't look like super Mitaka I might
try wetting it in a second but I'm just
gonna go and blend out those edges of it
this is that light pinkish shade that
looks like it has potential for the
inner corner I'm gonna try wedding these
I think they need a little help all
right
first I'm gonna go into lighter shade
though for the inner corner and then
I'll go back in with the darker one
since we're gonna be using the same
brush so I'm gonna take that light pink
shade I think okay I just wet it I'm
gonna try again in a little bit more on
the pup it almost sounds like a blue
tone to it I am going to go in with the
highlight palette I'm gonna take that
middle shade okay that's helping for a
lower lash line I'm gonna take a flat
edge brush and I'm gonna go in with that
same brown shade I just want to keep it
on the outer third right there I want to
try a wedding that middle brown shade
definitely made it more cool toned I
don't know about more metallic though
pretty color
just not very metallic and these are
quite scratchy so definitely pass
these so not super impressed by what
kind of bundles out I had high hopes for
this matte shades just aren't that soft
or pigmented red shape looks nice this
burgundy shade that looks really pretty
it's like some of them are soft and then
others aren't totally hard and Scratchy
all right we've got a liquid liner to
try folks this is their felt tip
eyeliner this was four dollars and
ninety cents that is what the tip looks
like whoa
very black it looks very shiny right now
but that might just be because it's wet
we'll see if it kind of mattifies I
can't actually see my face like straight
on like you guys can so whenever I edit
back my wings look totally different but
like right now they look the same size
so this one might be bigger I'm human
hmm yeah that one might be quite a bit
bigger actually it definitely isn't a
matte eyeliner it's actually very shiny
like super shiny feels sticky but it's
not transferring I think that's just how
it feels we'll see at the very end if it
still feels tacky like that but it feels
pretty sticky so I have this forever 21
Megha lash water resistant mascara they
didn't have forever 21 brand eyelashes
oh this looks exactly like covergirl
LashBlast I think that's what I'm
thinking I've look at this has the super
short stumpy kind of I can feel this
eyeliner on my eyes kind of like that
I'm not getting very much volume I'm
getting good length so I think layered
this one might work well with another
mascara then put on some other false
lashes and I will be right back
alright so just put on lashes and these
are so nice and fluffy and trying these
for the first time they're the morphe go
on in fake it's put on some bottom
mascara so for lipstick I got three
different options here well two
lipsticks and then one lip gloss this is
a velvet matte liquid lipstick this was
three dollars and ninety cents and then
this is the lipstick crayon I like the
packaging of the liquid lipstick with
the pink cap again by the way this isn't
a shade coffee
and then this lipstick crayon was also
390 and this
is things just natural oh it totally
forgot about this eyeshadow I just did
an army green look so I kind of didn't
want to use this anyways but I'll take
this out and swatch it actually I'm
gonna do that right now before I forget
it says velvet shimmer
this was 390 that's pretty expensive for
a single eyeshadow from forever 21
so let's see how this thing is doesn't
feel very soft feels very dry but that
looks pretty there's its watch that
looks pretty this lipstick you just
twist up oh this is very new D ooh that
looks pretty I might layer that on top
of the liquid lipsticks I do want to try
liquid lipstick smells like cake very
cakey mmm that smells really good
feels really thin ooh I like that color
a lot showing up a lot more warm on
camera it looks like feels pretty pretty
dry quite drying I almost don't want to
put this over top let's just try a tiny
bit right on the center way that was
pretty - that one looks like it has like
a cream finish I think I'm actually
gonna go over it oh wait I forgot about
this lip gloss this is the undercover
sheer lip gloss sealing the matte lip
right now so I don't think I actually
want to put this on but I'll swatch it
this was $4.90 it kind of looks like an
upside down lipstick it has the kind of
one that I like this is like the
smashbox always on liquid lipstick oh
that smells horrible mmm it smells like
molding Jolly Ranchers it says it's a
sheer lip gloss that is pretty friggin
pigmented first year looks like it has a
nice color to it it's unfortunate that
they put this horrendous scent in it
alright so this is the final look trying
out forever21 makeup I'm gonna go
through everything and tell you kind of
the standouts if there are any and the
things that I would just totally pass on
I think there are only two kind of three
that I sent my liked the first is liquid
lipstick just off on first impressions
it does feel quite drying but I love the
shade of this if you don't mind thin
kind of dry formulas and
best Foreman I've ever tried but the
shade is really pretty the total fail
but also kind of okay all on one is the
concealer this horrible this though
before I powdered with that setting
powder I did like how the concealer
looked I liked the peach tone but it is
still nice and brightening and light
enough and it looked really nice I had
good coverage so I would try that out
again and the third which the shade just
looks really nice and it felt nice and
creamy and everything when I applied it
on top of the local lipstick is the
lipstick crayon so definitely try that
again
he sent ones I think some people would
like is the illuminating powder the
highlighter little heart thing not
nearly as good like remotely as good as
the makeup revolution ones and those are
around the same price point so I really
I would just say for money and get those
and I like the end result of how the
blush looks don't think it's the best
formula like the essence one better yeah
everything else I tried I think save her
money oh by the way the eyeliner when I
was putting on the false lashes I can
still feel it feels like I have lash
glue all over my eyes it still feels
sticky and it's definitely very shiny
the eyeshadows i'm just not wowed by at
all I'll have everything link down below
