me my future or something all right so
today it is foundation Friday I saw this
ball on Instagram and felt like I needed
to try this thing this is a foundation
ball this thing just reminds me of a
magic 8-ball our board magic 8-ball is
where the this is the la splash
ultra defined cream foundation comes in
a little nice slide box so I did kind of
a double take when I went on their
website to order this because this
product retails for $28 la splash
cosmetics let's let that sink in that is
the price of a high-end foundation I
have absolutely no idea why it's priced
that high for la splash but of course
the week after I order this is on sale
for half off so it's actually on sale
for $14 right now on their website I'm
going to take a wild guess not enough
people are buying it at the $28 price
point get 30 milliliters of product in
here which is about 1 fluid ounce
product comes in 12 shades I have the
lightest shade macadamia some insert
swatches right here so you can see how
this shade compares to some of the other
lighter shades of foundation I have
alright so I'm filming swatches a
different day and my good camera totally
crapped out on me so I'm just filming
this in natural light with my blog
camera so starting on the far left is
the la splash foundation in macadamia
next overs Urban Decay Naked Skin
Foundation and 0.5 third over right in
the middle is derma called 2:08 next is
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless in
110 and last is the Revlon use fix
foundation in the lightest shade 110 and
I also have a review on that let's read
some of the claims on their website it
says it's an oil-free long wear matte
foundation superb coverage for velvety
soft finish that will last supposed to
keep the skin shine free and provide
full coverage without being chalky
if you're new here this is where I do a
new first impression video every single
Friday on my channel 6 p.m. sometimes I
do finally have the ordinary foundation
it finally came in after weeks and weeks
so the ordinary foundation will be
coming in next week's foundation Friday
video you want to see what I think of B
la splash foundation how it applies and
wears throughout the day in the right
place just keep watching
alright so I've already washed
moisturize and primed using my two
usuals which will be linked down below
I've only had half a cup of coffee this
needs to change right now so one half of
my face I'm use a dampened sponge like
you usually do this is actually
different
more everyone my go-to more who one is
that weird pointed once one from the
same line that's just shaped differently
so I want to try it out and this is a
cream foundation I mean they're going to
go in with my ELF brush or my Sigma f80
2 depending on what I feel so my skin
has a lot to cover up right now I'm
breaking out pretty much everywhere I
have a lot of smaller like whiteheads
going on right now that are happening a
few days ago so no if it was a reaction
to a product I used or what he knows
these days who knows right now it's 749
in the morning actually doesn't feel as
cheapy plasticky as I thought it feels
pretty heavy and then there's a little
sealant thing on here I haven't looked
at the color at all so I'm really hoping
this will match because I have to leave
the house today
we'll see I'll be out all day today so
fingers crossed this is a wearable shade
this is supposed to be full coverage it
feels kind of cooling ok I'm just going
to use my elf brush to start okay I
definitely need more it feels like it's
drying really really quickly but work in
sections because it gets a little stiff
to blend out but for a cream it feels
lightweight covered most of my acne
there's still a little bit coming
through down my neck looks matte and it
feels like it just totally set into my
skin in about 10 seconds I love
foundations that I feel like I don't
have to set with the powder just because
on my skin if I don't have to set
something with the putter it typically
looks a lot more natural the texture on
my skin I have combination skin for
those of you who are new so I get oily
throughout the day my primer has been
really helping with that the hilum ID I
always want to say Hanna lied I
definitely have some foundations that I
don't need to powder my skin at all in
my oil whole design it almost feels a
bit dry when you're blending it out
Elise with the brush don't not like the
way it feels it just doesn't feel very
creamy or moisturizing so here's before
and here's after I would say this is
full coverage if you use a decent amount
like I did on that first application
when I put less on it wasn't totally
covering but with this amount I got full
coverage so let's go ahead and try this
side with a sponge
like it's hard to kind of get right
around my nose with this sponge doesn't
look quite as full coverage with a
sponge and I used a similar amount of
product if you like yeah I'm definitely
liking this one better with a brush I'm
going to go back to the brush and add a
bit more to get the same kind of
coverage beside with a sponge I got
about medium coverage whenever I say
that I get people being like what are
you talking about it's totally full
coverage but trust me when I'm looking
in my mirror I can see freckles I
couldn't see my acne coming through it
is building up fine so that's good it
doesn't get cakey or weird texture
anything
once it has a powder finish but it
totally sets down and a lot of times
with foundations like that it can get
weird when you try to build it but this
one is not totally fine would that look
good now if you don't have acne this
will probably look totally full-coverage
on you I still can see some my acne
coming through which is fine because if
I wasn't doing a first impression out
doing some spot concealer on tops by the
way I definitely like the other morphe
sponge better not that into this one at
all
right now it looks good looks a little
bit heavier around my nose I'm hoping
that doesn't crease more throughout the
day but the center of my forehead looks
good I'm not going to set my face with
this one because I don't feel like I
need to I feel like I could blend
products on top it's supposed to help
control oil throughout the day right now
it's 801 we're going to call it check-in
time 8 o'clock in the morning I'm going
to do the rest of my makeup and I'll be
right back ok so it's now 827 was moving
kind of slow they didn't set my whole
face I just use my Laura Geller balance
and brightens just a super tiny bit on
the center of my face just to brighten
up the center of my face a bit and make
it even tender my eyes the shade is
totally wearable for me the more I've
had it on it's been on for a half hour
now and it's just kind of melted into my
skin and it looks really beautiful now
so I could even more right now it's
looking really nice let me tell you guys
what's on the rest of my face I used a
flower Beauty lifting sculpt contouring
palette I used the blush and the bronzer
shade in here really like the tone of
this bronzer both of these are extremely
pigmented you have to really blend and
work with it I use the makeup revolution
trio that I mentioned in my favorite
highlighters video that went up on
Wednesday of this week so leave that
down below if you missed it but this is
the ultra fair kit and I just use that
middle shade right there I mean for
eyeshadow I use the same contour kit
just in my crease lid I just use this
light matte shade supermom from the
tartlet palette my normal brows and
eyeliner and then lips
our colour-pop she bad kind of missed
like part of my lip over here so
check-in time is 8 o'clock next trip and
I do will be in natural lighting so I
will see you guys in a few hours
all right so it's no.1 10 p.m. in the
afternoon so it's been on for five hours
okay looks like it well are you should I
are starting right now is what do you
think of it it looks normal so you can
see some your acne it looks a little bit
heavy around my nose I feel like and I
noticed creasing on my upper lip like an
hour in but I feel like overall it looks
nice I'm not getting a whole lot of oil
coming through it doesn't do hear that
then when I first adorned is not totally
matte so far so good
any other thoughts do we do in Seattle
victory we're going to go thrift in
Value Village we're in Lake City I think
so I'll check in with you guys at the
end of the night it's now 6:30 so
foundations been on for over ten hours
ten and a half hours now they did a clip
in my car about a half hour ago you can
see some minister at that right here but
for being on for ten and a half hours
without setting my face as a powder I've
definitely had foundations look much
worse I wouldn't say I'm overly oily I'm
definitely doing I feel like I've been
doing some majority of the day if you
have more oily skin I don't think this
one's going to keep you super super
matte on its own but I don't mind it I
feel like it's just kind of a healthy do
right now I don't look overly oily but
it definitely is breaking down a certain
areas so if you look really up close on
the center of my forehead you can see
right here it is breaking down a little
bit and then I don't really like how
it's been looking around my nose in my
upper lip the whole day like I said the
creasing started pretty early on and it
has oxidized it's really hard to see
someone try and back up to give more
accurate color for a second it's a
little hard to tell but it has oxidized
and it's out of the shade too dark and
moles at sunburn right now overall I
think it looks pretty good I mean you
guys have seen much more disastrous
foundations on my skin whatever you sure
this one again on its own I don't know I
feel like there's a little bit of
something missing for me I think next
time I would mix in a tiny bit lighter
and more matte I might miss them like
the Lancome
24-hour tent Idol ultra and just see how
it mixes with something like that I
think it's one being best for normal
skin normal combo could probably work
because you know I'm not a total mess
right now
and keeping my I didn't set my whole
face of powder not totally in love and
definitely don't dislike this one I do
like that for the majority of the day I
do feel like it looked pretty skin like
I wanted this one looks super heavy or
anything on the skin so think I'm going
to just try and make students one and
see what I think of it do you need to
run out and get it I definitely would
not say for $30 for $14 and might be
worth giving a go if you guys enjoyed
this video and you like foundation
Friday don't forget to give this video a
thumbs up let me know down below for
what other foundations you guys want to
see like I said the ordinary foundation
is coming and I all still need to do the
match Co app need to do that if there
any others let me know love you guys
