knows
so today it is day 13 a 15 days of
foundation this is where I try out a new
foundation every single day for 15 days
we've already done 12 days those are
linked down below in the season 5
playlist but I also have 4 other seasons
of 15 days foundation if you're new here
today we have a foundation in a bag as
soon as I saw this I got so excited so
curious so I videos trying foundation in
a ball foundation in the jar and today
we're trying foundation in a bag I don't
think this is new I've just literally
never heard anything about this or even
seen this this is the cargo cosmetics
liquid foundation that's literally all
it's called dude cargo I feel like you
guys could have killed it with a name
for this one I just think this is such a
cool concept it's actually made of a
hundred percent recyclable material
which is really cool it's easy to travel
with it's super lightweight it's thin I
just love the whole idea of this I mean
this thing feels like a feather I feel
like this is something I could see like
milk makeup doing or something
looking on ulties website this retails
for at $36 you get 1.33 ounces of
product so even those looks like a tiny
little baby food packet you actually get
quite a bit of product in here so it
says this an ultra hydrating foundation
with medium to full coverage and a silky
finish suitable for all skin types as
this blendable lightweight and then it
says its sheer coverage that can be
built up part of the description says
sheer coverage the other part says
medium to full coverage says is supposed
to be ideal for oily skin types while
innovative skin conditioners hydrate dry
skin types without adding oil I have
more dry skin right now I have the shade
F 20 the lightest shade is F 10 which
says soft ivory very fair with warm
undertones F 20 said very fair with
peach undertones so that's why I went
with F 20 because of the undertones F 10
looked very yellow you guys will see the
shade fiasco
in the demo part of this video but there
are only eight shades in this foundation
I'm gonna start swatches right here so
you can see how the shade F 20 compares
to some of my other foundations the
swatches right here is the cargo
foundation in F 20 next over is milk
make up blur liquid and fair CYO life
proof in 101 NARS radiant foundation in
Mont Blanc derma called to zero
in Mark Jacobs remarkable intent if
you've been enjoying 15 days of
foundation and you're excited for this
final last few videos don't forget to
give this video a thumbs up I appreciate
it if you're new here you can join the
baby toe family and subscribe daily
reminder - whoa - whoa don't forget to
vote vote one time a day at the link
down below if you want to see my
thoughts on this cargo foundation in a
bag how it applies somewheres throughout
the day you're in the right place just
keep watching I'm so curious here we go
feels like day 13 I've washed moisturize
prepped my skin in the bag in a box it's
looking a little dark in this bag just
through here but maybe it looks
different this is so cool I actually
love this packaging even if you just
wanted to throw this in your purse it's
like a touch-up or something you have no
bottle it's super lightweight I'm just
gonna shake it in here I guess to mix it
or maybe kind of do a little this action
I feel like I'm about to eat one of
those applesauce things cool okay easy
oh that actually just fell on my
shirt trying to get some sweet guess
we're not wearing this shirt today gonna
go change your shirt BRB
shirt change instead I've got on my
dough talk to me as 15 days of
foundation t-shirt link down below we're
trying to raise $20,000 for project B to
share this design was one of the limited
edition ones that was brought back all
right we're back in action gonna attempt
not to spill on this shirt so I'm gonna
start out with a brush I just want to
keep squeezing stuff out of here the
shade on the palate is looking dark yeah
probably should have gone with the
lightest shade in this one yeah way dark
looking at my neck my face is a lot
darker than my neck so whenever I come
on a foundation I match it to my next
shade oh this one is like real dark
mm-hmm this is like dark where it's not
really wearable dark these actually
wanted to leave my cave today it's
sitting on my skin really nicely though
I'm feeling cabin fever this usually
happens throughout this series oh I'm
looking orange real orange dang man I
don't even think it's showing up on
camera but I look like biloba status
right now I'm debating white mixer No
mixer maybe I'll go on snapchat okay I
just posted a poll on Twitter I'm gonna
turn off the camera for like 15 minutes
leave to pull open and see what you guys
say if the majority of you are fine with
me mixing in a white mixer then I'm
gonna do that because guys I I really
feel like I need to get out of ass like
I look like a Clementine right now I'll
be back so far with the brush it's
sitting really nicely on my skin I like
the finish of it so we'll see what you
guys have to say all right I washed off
my face because Twitter has spoken so it
is been up for 17 minutes there are 392
votes on my screenshot this so I can
show it to you guys and it's a pretty
freaking close call we've got 44% of
viewers saying no don't leave your house
56 percent are saying yes lighten it
with mixer so yeah we're gonna lighten
this thing thank God thank you to those
of you who don't want me cooped up here
all day so it looked on the ingredients
on the back of the box here trying to
figure out if it's water based or
silicone based it looks silicone base to
me there's a lot of cones in there
dimethicone I think we can go with the
silicone base mixer so the two I'm
debating between are the LA girl Pro
coverage or the Knicks Pro foundation
mixer this one is pretty dewy this one
is more neutral but it doesn't lighten
as well I think I'm gonna go in with
this one just so it doesn't alter the
finish as much and at least you guys
have seen what it looks like on that one
layer without it all right shade is
looking a lot closer there we go
round two I'm glad I dunno what that
first layer looks like that without one
just so I can compare it to that too
this seems to set down pretty quickly
but it still feels really kind of gel
like and moisturizing but you can for
sure feel it drying down okay now we're
in the game here folks still looking
really nice on the skin so far I would
say it looks pretty much exactly the
same as far as finishing everything so
that's a good sign first you're gonna
have to smooth this out right here cuz
it's not liking the best with the brush
right on the center let's try to sponge
on the side getting out of the way oh
it's not looking good with a sponge
sheer coverage with a sponge I feel like
that just soaked up a lot of that I
definitely prefer the brush side better
right now
don't try and build this up with the
brush so as you're supposed to be able
to get medium to full coverage yeah
brush is the way to go with this one it
feels like it's setting down which I
really like
secondly are with the brush I'm getting
about high medium coverage
it's definitely building there are
certain areas where it's not sitting the
best like around my nose it looks a
little bit heavy my pores are out to
party right now I can just kind of like
see it chillin it's looking a lot better
on camera I think than it does in real
life I'm going to show you guys in
natural lighting once I do the rest of
my makeup it doesn't look bad right now
but I'm not totally wowed I'm gonna give
it a few minutes see if I don't have to
powder it and do the rest of my makeup
and then I'll be right back okay it's
now 1024 we're gonna call a check-in
time 10 o'clock I've powdered my face
around like 1002 so it felt like it
wasn't sliding around like it did feel
like a gel that was kind of setting down
but it still had a major stick to it so
I did have to powder my face he's my
laura geller balancing Brighton and I
actually powdered my full face my
forehead too because it just was looking
a little bit funky it looked like it
needed a powder just kind of smooth even
everything out and now that the powder
is on I think it looks nice I think next
time if I were to lighten it it probably
makes it in the la girl pro coverage
just because this gives you much more of
like a dewy smoothing kind of look this
one I do think like I said would alter
it more than this one so for the sake of
the review I'm glad I went with the next
one but just knowing how this one sits
on my skin now I probably would mix in
this one next time and depending on how
that would look I think I still would
powder my face but I'm gonna try out a
bunch of different combos like usual and
I'll update you guys in the wrap-up
video that's why I rank all the
foundations try them in different ways
that goes up April 9th
in that video I also announced the
winning city in the shelter that's
wedding $5,000 so that's where you guys
can vote one time a day down below the
link is right at the top the description
box but everything is gonna be wrapped
up announced how much we raised
everything is coming in that video I
wanna show you guys what this looks like
in natural lighting and we'll do a flash
test okay we're in natural lighting
right now looks good actually looks
better out here than it does under the
studio lights so let me zoom in looks
makeup ewwww but there's nothing
specifically that doesn't look good
right now let's do flash tests keep in
mind I have the laura geller powder on
right now that
the wall done this for 13 days in a row
so far and I still can't get this down
Oh looks pretty good with flash actually
looks really nice and soft and it there
doesn't seem to be too much of a bounce
back actually don't mind how it looks in
flash at all
so make up I used on the rest of my face
for eye shadow I used the wet and wild
palette in rose' in the air I just use
these two shades and then the shade to
line my lower lash line for blush and
bronzer all I used was the Milani blush
in Rosa romantica and this is kind of
like a warm peachy bronze I feel like
this is gonna be super lips super pretty
shade for the summer it gives you that
like bronzy but not too warm kind of
glow really like this one so far for
highlight used on my favorites the
goddess of love highlight by makeup
revolution
I think they repackage this I haven't
tried the new version I hope the formula
is the same but this one is amazeballs
for lips I use this Urban Decay lipstick
this is abstract and it's like a cool
toned nude and then I topped it off with
it's like the day of white mixers this
is the bite Beauty Blanc this is really
cool it's just a white lipstick right
now it has nude on the end but it's just
a white lipstick so you can address the
color of any of your lipstick so I just
put a little bit of that on the center
check in times 10 o'clock I'll see you
guys in a few hours and natural lighting
okay it's now 3 333 so it's non for
about five and a half hours I am having
one of those days where I'm like so
Restless I don't know what's going on I
want to like go on a run or something
right now we're all I think same thing
it still looks a little bit heavy old
butt makeup be but I was on snapchat a
little bit and it looks really good on
that camera very like smooth and glowy
looking it is separating a little bit on
my forehead and it is creasing a tiny
bit around my mouth area as per usual
actually I'm getting some creasing on my
upper lip too which I haven't been
getting last few days but so far so good
I'm gonna edit video number two and then
you know the house can its 824 so it's
been on for over 10 hours I went on such
a nice long walk made good food feeling
good
it was super sunny so I did have on
sunglasses so that's what those lines
are right there if anyone has any
tips on how to not get sunglass lines
let a girl know because I've never found
anything that works to knock at the
sunglass lines overall looks a bit dry
and I can just see it on my face it's
separating a little bit right on the
center there's nothing horrible or
shocking or out of the normal here it
just doesn't look the best on my skin
summer try mixing this one I'm not like
totally rolling it out I just don't feel
like I found a way that I like to wear
this one yet I really like the concept
of it I want to make this one work
because I just think would be really
handy and easy to travel with even
though it's a mixer if I like it mixing
it with other foundations that would be
great so I'm going to try a bunch of
different combos with this one I do take
notes every single time I test out one
of the foundations with different combos
and things just so I can remember
exactly what I used and tell you guys in
the wrap-up video so I'm going to try
this a bunch of different ways and you
guys will be hearing my thoughts on
April 9th so if you've been enjoying
this series don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up two days left so I'll
see you guys tomorrow and day 14 I love
you guys there's a special place in my
heart for everyone who voted for white
foundation mixer thank you
love you guys thanks for watching see
you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
