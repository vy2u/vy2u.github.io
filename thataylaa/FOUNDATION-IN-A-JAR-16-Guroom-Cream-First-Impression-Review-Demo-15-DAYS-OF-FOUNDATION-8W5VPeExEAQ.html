today it is day 15 of 15 days of
foundation we have made it I see the
light is 1 through 14 our link down
below if this is your first video that
you're watching here hello welcome to
the burrito fam I watched an Easter vlog
last night and I have such an intense
craving for deviled eggs right now so
quickly Before we jump into the
foundation which what the heck they're
in jars I'm so excited before we get
into these guys this is day 15 which
means the next video you guys are going
to see is the wrap-up video so if you
haven't seen any of my past to wrap up
video studies 2 or 1 yeah 2 from other
series that's basically where I rank all
the foundations 1 to 15 I've been pre
filming these videos for about a month
now though in between days of filming
I've been trying out different
combinations with the products so this
video is ending on a Wednesday and the
wrap-up video will be going live Friday
April 28th so typically have new videos
going up Monday Wednesday Friday my
schedule after 15 days the foundation is
always a little off because one I'm
freaking exhausted and dead after this
and two I need to try out all the
products for the wrap-up video and then
this one is extra tricky because I
actually leave for China on May 1st and
I'm going to be gone pretty much all of
May in different places so I am in major
pre-fill mode so my schedule is going to
be totally off for the next couple weeks
I'm going to tell you guys all about
that in a wrap-up video but there won't
be a video Monday or Wednesday the next
video you see will be Friday throughout
the video it'll be a good break for you
guys you want to see my face every
second day so for a day 15 I'm testing
out a product that I haven't heard
anything about this is a Korean
foundation in a jar no words what have
you commented saying to try this out
because it was full coverage and you
thought I'd really like it soon as I
heard full coverage I started doing
research and found this thing the brand
is called 16 brand and it's called this
16 groom cream because 0.7 ounces the
product in here so a little
it less than a standard fluid ounce for
the most part online is retailing for
around eighteen ninety-nine there's a
few different places online where you
can get this I got it off of Amazon but
when I'm filming this it just checked
and it's not really available on there
anymore so as I can find any other links
to where you can find this online it'll
be down below in the description box
this is a really interesting product so
it obviously comes in little mini mason
jars I have the lime tone it up shade
which is a green product and then the
foundation in 0/1 light beige so in the
actual foundation there's only two
shades zero one light beige which is the
lightest shades one I have and then
there's 0-2 sand beige this is pretty
typical from what I found with Korean
products they typically only have a few
shades so two shades in the foundation
but then there's a few different
versions of this product I wanted to
take up this lime one to counteract
redness I have cystic acne I have a lot
of discoloration on my face so you guys
will see me applying this before the
foundation they also make a pink one
mint and energy bomb says it's a full
coverage semi matte cream foundation say
goodbye to bumps freckles redness and
blemishes without looking or feeling
heavy full coverage with a weightless
breathable seal moisture condition and
promote a hydrated complexion it does
have SPF 30 in it so I'm going to be
doing a flash test so you guys can see
if there's any kind of bounce back but I
ministered swatches as this shade 0-1
light beige compared to some of the
other lightest foundation shades that I
own all right so swatch time right here
is the 16 brand gum cream and zero one
light beige next over is derma called
2:08 which is my closest shade match
Urban Decay Naked Skin Foundation in 0.5
pur cosmetics bear doll foundation in
porcelain these are actually both pretty
similar in tone here cosmetics just
about half a shade lighter and then last
is Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
in 110 just purchased and giggles I'm
going to go ahead and lightly swatch
this green one so there it is right
there it's almost like a white it just
has a light green tint to it so that's
all the information I could find about
this product online if you guys have
been enjoying 15 days foundation don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up I
appreciate it welcome to all the new
baby toes make sure you say hi down
below if you found my channel through
this series this time around and also
the t-shirts are going to be available
until the wrap up video so if you
haven't had a chance to purchase on
those 100% of the proceeds go to Project
Beauty share what we need to breathe so
if you want to see what I think of the
16 brand Goom cream and how it applies
more throughout the day you're in the
right place just keep watching
okay so right now it's a 9
forty-eight in the morning I've been
doing laundry and really some things all
morning attempting to get my life
together right now
I've already washed moisturize and
primed my face use my Laura Mercier
foundation primer like usual so I'm
going to start out with the lime tone it
up just to cancel out some of the
redness on my face and see what happens
kind of wish I got the pink one as well
because I've heard of people mixing that
in to actually lighten the foundation
this is definitely the cutest packaging
I've ever seen just want to put this on
my shelf
it also has SPF 30 in it so that's good
to put underneath your makeup there's a
little sealing when you take the lid off
I typically don't use any kind of
correctors or anything sometimes I'll go
in and spot conceal just cover up my
acne before I put on a foundation so
I've to use less product but I don't
really use any kind of color correctors
this looks very thick this is super
thick so I'm just going to start out
with that amount I guess and put this on
it has an interesting scent that's
smelly this is how I usually like my
primers to feel it has kind of a sticky
feel to it it doesn't feel too sick I
mean that definitely canceled out some
redness if you look at it compared to my
forehead I need a tiny bit more for my
forehead so I'm just going to take a
super small amount has a little bit of
like a light white tint to it overall I
feel like that helped to brighten my
complexion of it I wouldn't wear this by
itself like if I'm having a no makeup
day because my face does look a little
bit white right now has a bit of a
residue to it I don't mind it on my face
but you can definitely feel it it feels
like a sick sunscreen alright come on
and that cream came with a little
spatula - I just realized what's not
sure why there's pencils on here but
that's cute this is so satisfying this
one looks a tiny bit less stick almost a
little bit more creamy so I'm half of my
face i'm using morphe 31 brush and on
the other half my Real Techniques sponge
is my favorite sponge I'm going to
switch it up I usually do the brush on
this side let's start out on this side
with a brush one of you guys commented
that just so we can see since I have
more acne down here just so it's a fair
test I think I'm just going to use the
little spatula things and mix it a
little bit just in case this is supposed
to be full coverage so I don't know how
much product I'm going to need right now
but we'll just don't know let's do this
whew this has good coverage is a bit
dark I feel like I didn't use that much
product just then and we got really good
coverage I'm going to bring this down my
neck off of that one layer with the
brush I would
full-coverage and it looks really nice
when I'm here it looks super smooth it
looks like a BB cream almost maybe we'll
try and mix in a little bit of this I
don't know let's just finish this off
I'm really liking how this side of my
face looks let's try the sponge on this
side my pores look really good around my
nose I'm putting a little bit more on my
scarring and acne down here with this
sponge isn't totally totally covering up
all of my scarring you can still see it
coming through but it looks like enough
coverage but where it still looks like
natural and looks like skin with the
brush on this side it covered it pretty
well so might just be with a sponge so
I'm going to go back in with a brush
after we do my forehead and see if I can
cover that a little bit better I'm
getting a bit better coverage with a
brush for sure blend this out with the
brush if you want coverage brush is
definitely the way to go this side with
a brush I think I'd be good to go I
don't need a second layer as far as
coverage aside I have pretty much one
and a half layers on to get the same
kind of coverage that I got with the
brush everything besides the shade right
now I am lovin looks radiant but not
overly dewy and just feel like it's
starting to set still feels tacky like I
don't think I could blend product on top
right now but it does feel like it's
setting down it doesn't feel like a
cushion foundation where you feel like
it's going to slide all over think once
I have concealer on and I probably am
going to powder my face with this I
think once I do those two things the
shade will be fine so I feel like my
skin just looks super smooth I like the
coverage doesn't dharmic all extreme
kind of full coverage but it covered
everything that I needed covered and it
just looks like skin it looks super
pretty the finish of it okay so right
now it's 1134 but we're calling to check
in time 10:15 since that's when I
finished up my makeup I've just been
doing more laundry ate breakfast
everything's been on for a little over
an hour right now and it looks freaking
amazing I've looked at it in natural
lighting I looked at it in the bathroom
it just looks so healthy and smooth and
plump I'm hoping I don't get oily with
this because I'm looking pretty dewy and
I did set my face with the powder
he's my cover effects illuminating
setting powder to set my face I do think
that helped to kind of lighten the
foundation a little bit it's wearable
like I would go outside now with the
powder on top in this shade but it's
definitely still too dark it's hard to
tell in this lighting but I took a
picture standing in front of the window
here it
right here so you can see what the shade
really looks like so I definitely need
to make something in with this now that
the powders on it still feels a little
bit tacky but more just like you have a
moisturizer on or something forehead
looks really good around my nose looks
good so I'm going the hallway to do a
flash test when I do it under these
lights sometimes it does weird things so
I'll be right back and I'll show you
guys what this looks like with flash
since it does have SPF 30 so it
definitely has a bit of a white cast for
flash photography
in real life is darker than my face and
in this photo it definitely looks a
couple shades lighter than my chest area
so there is bounce back at shade aside
I'm loving it right now fingers crossed
I don't get super oily and this one
wears well throughout the day because
right now I'm into it so now oh what's
on my face so bronze I use the new Becca
bronzer this is in the shade Bali sands
look at this shade it looks really nice
in the pan like light enough and I do
like it I feel like you need to play
around with this a little bit more and
look at it in natural lighting stuff
blush wet and wild in a purple haze
highlight I used the etude secret beam
highlighter this is stunning I feel like
this product is totally underrated I
also use that on my inner corners on my
eyes I've actually never tried out this
palette before I got this during the
tart friends and family sale again I
feel like I need to play around this
more just fill this packaging that snap
shut so good mascara is my normal combo
this down below this is the Viva Glam
gaagaa - and then I topped it with the
MUA lip gloss and baby doll it's a bit
already think baby pink I have some
people come in to buy furniture right
now so I didn't want to like scare them
off with the full face makeup next check
and ID will be a natural lighting so I
will see you guys in a few hours okay so
it's now 3:23 so if I Nations anon for
five hours films another video I filmed
a thrift haul which will be up in a week
or two after you guys are seeing this so
overall I'm liking how it's looking I
feel like I look a little bit oily on my
forehead it's starting to get oily but I
really like how it looks
forehead down I think this might be one
that I should use a different powder
with or maybe a mattifying primer the
other thing I like is that it's not
creasing anywhere or looking cakey
anywhere where I normally get that
around my nose area and upper lip it
just looks really nice and smooth
everywhere my 4 has not bad oily right
now I just feel like I'm going to get
pretty oily so I'll check back in with
you guys at the end
now 8:16 has been on for pretty much
exactly 10 hours I have to say for being
someone who has oily skin and this being
a dewy foundation I do think this is
held up pretty well I obviously bit oily
on my forehead but I definitely have
foundations that are worse there is some
separation but it's not horrible on my
forehead so here's what it looks like up
close I feel like it still looks pretty
nice and smooth and definitely on try
this with a mattifying primer maybe a
different powder but if you have dry
skin or just normal skin I feel like
this one could wear well on you if you
like more high coverage foundations
because it feels very moisturizing
almost gel like I like this one thing I
would like it even better once I mix it
and play around with it but overall I
mean there's not a lot to complain about
right now so after you guys on my final
thoughts and my ranking in that video
and I won't do it for a while it'll be a
little over a week I love you guys I
hope you enjoyed season 3 of 15 days of
foundation if you did make sure to give
it a thumbs up I appreciate it in a help
now
love you guys thanks for watching see ya
my next video bye
