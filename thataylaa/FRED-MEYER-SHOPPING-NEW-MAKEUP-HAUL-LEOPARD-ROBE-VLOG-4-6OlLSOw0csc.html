a leopard roadblock I finally got my act
together and I'm gonna go find birthday
presents for my roommates because both
of them have birthdays one after the
other so thing we're gonna go to Fred
Meyer on base today I'm wearing the
Rimmel lasting finish 25 hour foundation
which I filmed a whole review on which
was such a show because of the new
camera I'll link it over here if you
missed it but yeah I've been really
liking it then on my eyes is kind of a
strange combo of three pallets solo look
palette and this is by Sola look what I
call it the gracias palette and some of
the shadows from revealed three which
very mixed feelings let me know down
below if you want to hold me on the
reveal three alright so we are gonna go
and hopefully I will have the balls to
blog in admire I got the irresistible me
sapphire curling wand set this comes
with a ton of different ones
isn't that focusing there we go there's
all different ones in here that is what
I use to curl my hair today my hair is
so thick that it's really difficult to
curl it and leave it down that's why I
usually curl it with a straightener
because then it's like flatter on the
top I feel like it looks like very
natural just messy girls anyways
all right so that was a pretty
successful Fred Meyer trip probably more
successful than I wanted it to be how
does that happen I literally spend $80
and I didn't even get anything
significant besides one present maybe
I'll show you when I get home I got some
really good Essen stuff Fred Meijer when
the only places besides Ulta around here
at least the carries essence so whenever
I am there you gotta pick some essence
up you know what I'm saying it is really
difficult to drive and at the same time
it's 12:30 now know it's 1:30 oh
it's 1:30 now I have to go home and do
some work YouTube stuff and work work so
that's fun this is a Saturday I was
going to get my car wash today and then
it rained so now I don't need to
no detour we're stopping at Wendy's
right now changed into Saturday work
attire right so I want to show you guys
what I picked up at Fred Meyer where are
we gonna put this I actually got a
ton of makeup I am wearing some of them
right now I just applied it which you'll
see in a clip after this probably is I
am freaking obsessed with so these are
the matte effect essence xx XL
long-lasting lip gloss these are totally
just in a lip gloss display if you
didn't turn it over and see the matte
effect sticker you wouldn't even know
these were matte liquid lipsticks you
totally remind me of all the like liquid
lipsticks coming out except these are
three freakin dollars and I'm wearing
one on my lips right now and I'm
obsessed with it I also picked up two
liners in the shade 0-3 berry and 0-6 No
0-5 berry and 0-6 satin mauve then I
picked up this eye liner by essence
which I've never seen
it's the two-in-one eyeliner pen there's
a thick side and a thin side and I kind
of swatch this on my hand in the store
and it was super black and it stayed on
the whole time I was shopping Maybelline
New York fit me concealer in 15 fair I
know they had a lighter shade than this
technically it's like 10 light I think
it was called for porcelain it looked
way darker than the fair shade a few
people have commented saying that these
are great concealers I don't know
they're having two dollars off
Maybelline so felt like it's time to
pick it out then I got this which I'm
super excited about this is the
Physicians Formula City glow this is a
brand new bronzer by Physicians Formula
oh my god
first of all the packaging is really
cute it's like matte black with gold
it's two-toned and the shade on top
looks like it would be really nice for a
contour it's pretty cool toned and then
the one on the bottom is warmer so you
could use it as a bronzer or just mix it
together and use it to warm up your face
I know Physicians Formula they usually
just have a gold overlay like that's not
actually gonna stay on there so you can
either wipe it off for the first few
times it'll have a glow and after that
it'll be mad right now Physicians
Formula is 40% off at Fred Meyer then I
got just hair clips for styling and
stuff and then my hair dye which is the
Revlon
10 black I always get questions about
this this is the soft berry lip liner
obviously just line my lips and now I'm
gonna filled in with the long-lasting
matte lip gloss this is in the shade
soft nude heck yeah it smells exactly
like the Stila patina or Stila stay all
day liquid lipsticks it smells like cake
and I tried to smell the end it went on
super smooth it dries matte it kind of
reminds me of the NYX soft matte lip
creams like the texture of it so i
swatched a few of them together the one
on the far left is NYX Stockholm the
middle one is the one that's on my lips
the soft nude essence and then the one
on the right is a velvet rose by assume
so which is actually a lot Pinker than I
thought
it looks kind of you ignore that makeup
wipe it looks kind of like ma V in the
tube it's definitely more on the E like
almost corally pink side the middle one
I'm obsessed with it's got the two lip
liners the one on the top is satin mauve
and then the one on the bottom is 0-5
soft berry is on the bottom both of
these are super pretty I almost think
the mauve one might have been a better
pair with that middle color these were a
dollar fifty each which is insane and
then I think the liquid lipsticks were
like three dollars I went down to check
the mail and these earrings came in from
eBay and I'm kind of obsessed with them
I don't know if you guys have seen this
like trend lately but I've seen pearl
ones I haven't really seen silver on
silver but I kind of liked it they kind
of look like I don't know not gauges but
they look kind of intense and I like it
I'll link it down below if you guys want
to buy them off eBay this is typically
how I work I have my personal computer
right here where I'm about to upload so
I can edit work computer right here
which I didn't buy this one this is just
a computer that work gives us I kind of
multitask so I can get stuff done okay
so I can get stuff done for YouTube and
for work and then here's my Erin Condren
planner just so I can attempt to stay
organized what is going on right now
good look alright it's been about two
hours and the lip stuff is still looking
pretty dang good I think it's like
completely still on the best
finally done editing turns out I'm going
to sushi so I need to get my
together oh yeah looking good
interception so we are just killing time
as we wait for our sushi reservations
really good we are back from sushi got
the leopard robe on I'm just gonna take
off my makeup and watch watching the
Americans if you like this video and you
