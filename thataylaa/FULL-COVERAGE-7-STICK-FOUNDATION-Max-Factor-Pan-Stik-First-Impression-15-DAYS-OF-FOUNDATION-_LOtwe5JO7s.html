alright so today it is day six of
fifteen days of foundation I just put my
false lashes on the wrong eye and I'm
craving sushi for breakfast
that is what kind of day it is today
this is what I do new first impression
video every single day for fifteen days
days one through five are linked down
below in the description box in a
playlist along with the eBay shop and
links as a limited edition t-shirts 100%
the proceeds go to project view share so
today we're talking about a foundation
that I haven't heard anything about on
YouTube this is the Max Factor pan stick
foundation this has amazing reviews on
Amazon one of my favorite things to do
at night when I can't sleep at 2:00 a.m.
is go through Amazon and find products
that have never heard about I am not
100% positive but I think this used to
be sold in stores in the US I'm not sure
if it's still sold in stores in the UK
but you can find this on Amazon but this
just had pretty rave reviews so on
Amazon I got this for $6 93 cents with
free shipping so it kind of ranges
between about 7 and 9 bucks and you get
9 grams of product in here to give you
some comparison and the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD foundation stick you get twelve
point five grams of product Amazon
prices always fluctuate depending on how
many people are buying them sellers
usually jack up the price if there's a
ton of people buying something sold and
roasted foundation is one of my
favorites I did a review on it during
last series or was that during the first
series but that was a random Amazon find
always that video down below if you
missed it so this product comes in nine
shades which isn't super great the
darkest shade it looks like is 97 cool
bronze and the lightest shade is 12 true
beige which is what I have you guys will
see in the demo what I think of this
shade but I'm an insert swatches right
here of this foundation compared to the
makeup rubber stick foundation I don't
think I have the golden rose right here
to swatch I'm pretty sure it's in my
office but I'm going to search some
shade comparisons right now alright so
swatch time right here's the Max Factor
stay
foundation in the lightest shade 12 true
beige which as you can see is pretty
dark next over is makeup ever altra HD
foundation stick in 115 next to that is
another one of my random Amazon finds
this is the Jolie stick foundation and I
shade soft cream I'm a whole video on
this I love this thing here's derma
called 2:08 Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless 110 last is Urban Decay Naked
foundation in 0.5 so reading some of the
claims from the Max Factor website says
pan stick foundation gives you maximum
coverage with minimum effort this creamy
texture provides a soft dewy finish
helps conceal pigmentation birthmarks
and blemishes smooths away fine lines
and wrinkles that's all it says on there
I love a good stick foundation the Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation is kind
of my go-to when I want something full
coverage but that's really quick and
easy to apply this one isn't the most
long-lasting on me
this is kind of something that I throw
on if I'm going to go run errands and I
want to look put together but I don't
want to take a half hour to do my makeup
I actually have a whole separate
playlist of just stick foundation
reviews so if you want to see more stick
foundations down below if you've been
enjoying 15 days of foundation and
you're excited for this video don't
forget to give this a thumbs up my mouth
was just not working for a second if you
want to see what I think of the Max
Factor pan stick foundation and how it
applies and wear throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching alright so it is 8:40 in the
morning we need all the coffee today
it's some day when I'm filming this
Savard you wash moisturize and prime my
face using the Laura Mercier foundation
primer like I'm doing every day
throughout this series I have my Real
Techniques damp sponge here I'm not sure
if I'm going to use this typically for
stick foundations my ELF brush applies
this the best packaging feels pretty
cheap super basic roll-up packaging on
their website it says to use your
fingers to blend this out so I'm going
to try that on half of my face or part
of my face first we're going to go in
with the elf brush on this side I'm just
going to do my normal kind of three
little stripes I usually do a stick
foundations and go in and blend whew
okay it has a really distinct scent to
it
woah literally smells like bathroom
spray this is blending out you
we actually and it looks super nice and
smooth has more of a satin kind of dewy
finish right now shade is definitely too
dark I'm just going to majorly blend it
down my skin tone or any lighter you
definitely have to use a white stick
foundation to mix in with this to
lighten it I know of a couple of
different white stick foundations so
I'll link those down below this is like
gliding over my skin not quite as much
as the makeup Trevor stick foundation
but I'm having no trouble blending this
out it looks really nice on my skin
right now covering everything I would
say that this is full coverage on this
side I'm liking everything right now
except the shade so I'm going to try
just a tiny bit down here with my
fingers see how it goes on a daily basis
I probably would not use my fingers and
the brush was pretty quick and easy
I mean fingers are working fine but I
prefer a brush so I'm going to go ahead
and finish that off oh yeah
this scent woah yeah it smells like
bathroom spray mixed with Dollar Tree
perfume Jade never shows up quite true
to color under these lights but you guys
will see in the next check-in how dark
this is I think I can make it work once
I put on my concealer and I think I am
going to set my face with this one it's
very luminous which I don't mind but I'm
just worried that I'm going to get too
oily it feels like it's setting but it
doesn't feel quite set enough to blend
powder products on top for me so thing I
am going to set this one with the powder
but it is looking good you guys
super smooth on the center of my
forehead it kind of just smoothed out
all my texture almost great coverage I'm
going to show you the close-up right now
alright so here's what it looks like up
close I mean pretty much all of my acne
scarring everything is covered
I feel like my face looks very smooth
and fresh right now it is 8:51 I'm going
to apply the rest of my makeup and I'll
be right back alright so it's now 9:40 -
I put my false lashes on the wrong eyes
so that was fun 10 points for gryffindor
finished my face makeup around 9:15 so
that's when we're going to call the
check-in time so I just set my face I
use my favourite cover effects
illuminating setting powder this stuff
is amazing if you haven't tried it if
I'm going to powder my face in a
foundation first impression is with one
of my three go-to powders where I know
how they work and how they perform and
shade aside right now it looks for
in amazing my skin looks super smooth it
looks like skin and it feels like skin I
don't feel like I have a ton of makeup
on at all so on the rest of my face for
blush slash bronzer I just use kind of
two bronzers I use the freedom Pro
contour kit in the shade medium I love
this shade right here and then I also
went in with the Burberry earthy blush I
can get this thing open right there I
pretty much use this thing all over my
face this is the Ofra nikkietutorials
ever glow highlight and it is very
intense as you can see it emphasizes my
texture a tiny bit but I just went in
with this shade right here and these are
so intense you can use them as
eyeshadows this copper shade is what's
on the center of my lid and then I also
have this shade on my inner corner and I
also have this shade on my lips on top
of Afra kovin this is also in her
collection and then for the matte
shadows I use the modern renaissance
palette I think that's it right lashes
lashes out of the kiss faux mink
collection lash Couture so next I can I
do will be natural lighting I'm pretty
sure I'm going to be spending the day
editing so I will check back in with you
guys in a few hours
I am yep about the Kim spit all right so
now 243 so the Foundation's been on for
as I just totally insane
probably my nation's been on for over
five hours over five and half hours
eyelashes the rough lipstick is off I'm
about to go on a walk because we finally
have a semi nice day in Seattle right
now even though it's like 45 degrees out
sunny so I need to go in the Sun right
now right now I think it looks pretty
dang good has more of a dewy kind of
finish for sure even with the powder the
illuminating powder does give a little
bit of lumination obviously but I once a
I look oily yet I think it just looks
like a healthy kind of blow right now so
my only critique right now open you guys
in the only thing I'm noticing right now
that I'm not loving is I'm getting a
little tiny bit of creasing on my upper
lip not super noticeable but it is there
and then around my nose area it's
starting to get a little bit cakey
looking right there I don't know if you
guys can see that but hopefully it
doesn't get worse throughout the day
everything else I mean look how smooth
my skin looks right now I feel like it
just totally smooth out the texture and
everything trying to find lighting where
it looks there we go as you can see
a dark I feel like I finally have
accurate lighting right here so this is
this is how dark it looks in real life
so just you can see the shade yeah then
I step out and it looks totally
different so I'm going to go get my walk
on and finish editing I've already
edited one video I'm about to edit a
second video yeah
protective sundae so I'll check in with
you guys at the end of the night okay so
it's now almost 8 o'clock so it's been
on for pretty much almost 11 hours
that's a little better
yeah I'm pretty oily right now around my
nose area and on my forehead but there
is some separation it looks like there's
a tiny bit of separation on the center
of my forehead but mostly just oils I
think this is one that just isn't very
long-lasting if you have oily or skin if
you have dry skin you might really like
this because it does go on really doing
moisturizing when you first put it on I
really love how it goes on and how it
looks for the first I'll say for the
first like 7 hours I definitely need to
mix it in with a white stick foundation
next time and I also I'm going to play
around with different powders but I like
it it's just not long-lasting I would
use it again for just like night time or
certain events or whatever where I don't
need it to stay like morning tonight
kind of thing because for pretty much
the first like 2/3 of the day it does
look really nice and flattering on the
skin especially if you have a lot of
texture and stuff to cover up I feel
like this is one that I can make work if
I just play around with it more so I'm
going to keep testing it and I'll let
you guys know what I come up with during
the wrap-up video I bring all the
foundations 1 to 15 at the end of this
series in a separate video so that's
where you will hear my final thoughts
but I'm freaking hungry right now having
eaten yet so if you guys like this video
and are enjoying 15 days of foundation
make sure you give this a thumbs up love
you guys thanks for watching see you
tomorrow
