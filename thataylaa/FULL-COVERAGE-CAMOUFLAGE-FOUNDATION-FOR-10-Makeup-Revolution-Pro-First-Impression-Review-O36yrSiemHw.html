Friday happy foundation Friday folks
today we're trying out a brand new
foundation by makeup revolution this is
the revolution Pro full coverage
camouflage foundation I bought two
shades of this there was some video I
don't know if it's on Facebook or
Instagram of a guy with tattoos and they
were using this to cover it up and that
instantly caught my attention I love a
good full coverage foundation the
foundation retails for ten bucks super
affordable
you only get 0.87 ounces of product so a
little bit less than the standard one
fluid ounce that usually get in
foundation comes in 18 shades I have the
two lightest shades f1 and f2 says it's
highly pigmented and creamy creates
maximum coverage with an even natural
looking finish you can blend it out with
a brush or a sponge to cover blemishes
scars birthmarks veins and temporarily
disguised tattoos so this waterproof
non-transferable long wearing so just
comes in basic obviously squeeze tube
packaging twist off you squeeze it out
nothing major
I actually placed a giant order on their
website because there was a ton of new
releases that looked really interesting
I also picked up their foundation stick
and then they have new lightening drops
and I also got the foundation drops
really curious about the stick
foundation I was kind of going back and
forth between which one to do for this
video I'm gonna search swatches right
here so you can see how the shades f1
and f2 compared to some of my other
friend Asian this morning probably the
worst shirt for swatches right now okay
here are some swatches right here is the
revolution Pro foundation in the
lightest shade F 1 and then F 2 next to
it here's CYO life proof in 101 flower
beauty light illusion in the lightest
shade L one NARS sheer glow in Siberia
and dermal called 2:08 so if you enjoy
foundation Friday and you're excited for
this video don't forget to give it a
thumbs up if you're new here you can
join the BAE radio family and subscribe
upload every Monday Wednesday Friday 6
p.m. Pacific Time foundation Friday is
every single Friday okay so it's 1907
right now I've already prepped my skin
like I usually do link the products down
below but this $10 foundation I'm so
excited to try my skin is still more on
the dry side normal to dry this video
you guys are seeing a couple weeks after
I'm filming it but right now I'm a
out what am I like six days off a cute
eight so it's gonna still more on the
dry side I think I'm gonna start out
with a shade F one and just see how it
is it says supposed to be fair skin with
neutral undertones that's me oh that
looks pretty light that might be a
little bit too light let me try the f2
so here's F one here's F two I'm
thinking I'm gonna be closer to f2 if
this doesn't oxidize but I'm gonna try a
little cheek swatch of f1 right now oh
well yeah I'm gonna be closer to f2 so
I'm actually gonna just dab that on
probably just got too much it'll spread
this so let's start out with the brush
on this side just go in the oldest like
it has a drag to it not blending out
super easily feels pretty kind of dry
blending out this definitely feels like
one you have to work quickly with seems
like it dries super fast reading on my
skin pretty nicely definitely looks like
a matte finish since I had a lot of f1
down here I'm just gonna use F 2 on my
forehead because I think I'm definitely
closer to this shade see how far this
goes mmm looking a bit makeup be up
there so let's try the sponge on the
other side and just using the shade F to
turn it out with a pretty small amount
and I still have a lot left of this
shade so a little bit does go a long way
not like totally blown away by the
coverage right now I don't think this
would cover tattoos because you can
still see freckles coming through it
looks like full coverage but kind of a
lo full coverage this isn't like maximum
I could be kind of coverage let's try
this side yeah this dries very quickly
oh that looks horrible over my pores
what just happened well is like making
my pores look giant on this side for
some reason I mean they don't look small
on this side but this side is like
really intense around my nose ringing I
always just take a tiny bit of whatever
foundation I'm using on this brush this
is the morphe G 38 I just go right over
it and around it and then I just wipe
off the makeup this part of my face
looks much better with the sponge or
things in the brush side but
my pores whoa looks a lot better on my
forehead now that I've gone over it with
the sponge still looks very makeup B I
wouldn't say this is like a soft matte
kind of look like last week's foundation
Friday this is definitely kind of a
heavier matte look the coverage is not
nearly as full coverage as I was
picturing you can still see some
scarring and stuff coming through so if
you had acne I definitely don't think
this would like completely cover it the
way this looks on my skin I don't think
I would build this up I think it could
really get super cakey looking since are
you looking a little bit rough this is a
little bit too cakey looking I have a
feeling that this probably could look a
bit better with some mac fix+ or
something I don't really like a whole
lot about this one I don't think it's as
full coverage as it should be for kind
of how it's marketed there's not really
one thing that I like about it not
feeling this one but we'll see how it
works throughout the day maybe it just
needs to warm up to my skin a little bit
so to the touch it does feel like I
could blend powder products on top it
doesn't feel like a totally powder
finish but it doesn't feel to stack
stacky
what was I going for sticky and tacky
I'm not gonna set my face don't feel
like I need to add another layer product
on top of here I think it'll just look
like too much right now it's 9:20 so I'm
gonna do the rest of my makeup and I'll
be right back okay so it's now almost 10
o'clock but the check-in time let's call
it 9:30 so I just wanted to say looking
at it more I do feel like this is full
coverage I don't think it's the kind of
full coverage that would 100% cover acne
it's not like derma Paulo or huda beauty
kind of coverage don't love how it's
sitting on my skin I actually think it
looks a bit better on camera somehow so
maybe this is a good filming foundation
just on my skin it looks a bit too
textured and it's just kind of like
emphasizing everything my pores in my
forehead so right now I'm not hating it
but I'm also not loving it I just feel
like I have other matte foundations that
sit a lot better on my skin and that
have similar coverage but on the rest of
my face I warmed it up with this bronzer
which I actually really like put it on
my temples to to get my face some more
warmth since that shade is a little bit
too light this is the bye bye pours
bronzer by it cosmetics I think this is
new this isn't the shade beech and then
for blush I used the blush that I got
from the Whole Foods makeup video
like that in the eye and down below if
you missed that but this is the mineral
fusion blush in the shade pale this is
like one of the few if not only thing I
liked from that video and I've still
been using this I've used this probably
ten times since then
elf illuminating palette is my highlight
I've used the shade for years I love
this one of my favorite highlights of
all time and then my eye shadow I just
did really basic I'm actually gonna go
to the mall right now have a ton of
stuff to return we've going a little
online shopping crazy lately but for
eyes I used one of the most beautiful
palette of all times this is the Tarte
foiled finger paints these shades are
just so beautiful and I went in with
this shade and kind of a mix of this one
too that's what's on my lids you can
make these even more intense and then
for the mattes I use this Smashbox trio
thing this is nudie pic light and my
lips how many times have you guys seen
this this is the Maybelline vivid hot
lacquer and the shade tease and I
actually didn't put anything under or
over this this time is just the lip
product so it just gives you like a
really pretty pale kind of pinky nude
shade I'm gonna show you guys what this
looks like in natural lighting and then
we'll do a flash test here is up close
as you can see I'm getting some crease
in here do not love how it looks in this
area and again for some reason this side
looks a little bit better it still
doesn't look great on my pores but this
side is like they look huge
yeah you don't look how it's sitting on
my nose either I felt like when I put my
highlighter on it kind of did something
like funky on my nose here's my forehead
again just looks pretty makeup B you can
definitely like see it sitting on up
there and it does seem to be settling
into some lines I didn't know I had over
here right now it's definitely looking
pretty makeup e part way it looks great
let's do a flash test let me know if
lash tests are even helpful should I
keep doing flash tests or should I just
stop because I feel like no one ever
comments about them so I don't know if
they're actually something that you guys
care about this one considering it's
already a bit light for my skin I don't
think it looks too bad in flash I feel
like if I had the right shade it
wouldn't look too bad so that's good
okay it's four hours later it's now 1:30
and I have been out just got home I was
talking a lot and things and I def
we have some major creasing you can see
on both sides I usually don't get it all
the way up here that bad so I'm
definitely creasing I also feel like my
forehead looks even worse now oh yeah
creasing on the center of my forehead it
looks even more just like heavy and
textured and everything just not very
flattering I'll see you guys at the end
of the night okay so what time is it I'm
supposed to be going out in like 15
minutes at 7:45 and the couch is
sounding really good right now
and I really can't even be bothered to
like open a can to eat soup Wow
for swirl problems the Foundation's been
on for almost 10 hours
oh wait over 10 hours simpered yeah over
10 hours whew
okay settling into lines up here but
also just looks so like thick and cakey
and then down here same thing on both
sides it's creasing a shit-ton this one
I think we know how I feel about it just
doesn't look great on my skin maybe if
you have oily or skin it would do better
but on dry skin it just looks not good I
think it's gotten worse throughout the
day at least hasn't oxidized though the
shade is still the same but I just don't
think this one's for me I'm not gonna be
reaching for it I don't really like one
particular thing about it again maybe if
you have a different skin type it would
look a bit better but I need to get my
act together we're doing this but I hope
you guys enjoyed foundation Friday if
you did don't forget to give it a thumbs
up I love you guys thanks for watching
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
