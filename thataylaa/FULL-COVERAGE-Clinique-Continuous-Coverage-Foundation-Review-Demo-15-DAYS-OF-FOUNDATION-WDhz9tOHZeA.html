checking what day it is because I have
no idea
six day six feel like my lash is on my
eyebrow right now alright so today it is
day six of fifteen days of foundation
this is where I'm trying out a new
foundation every single day for 15 days
if you've missed any of days one through
five and will link them down below in a
playlist along with everything else you
want to know what's on the face products
everything is always down there so
today's foundation is one that I haven't
heard anything about literally nothing
on YouTube when I was researching for
this video I went on to youtube to try
and find videos about it
I've only find a few videos about this
product I feel like this is kind of a
hidden one I never heard of this
foundation no idea existed until one of
you guys snapchatted me a while ago
saying I had to try it I'm going to love
it it has amazing coverage so I picked
it up this is the Clinique continuous
coverage makeup now the shades in this
again Clinique what is up with your
shades I don't get it shades are always
out of order numbered weird you kind of
have to like go to a counter to figure
out what shade you are on Sephora this
foundation only comes in two shades on
their website it comes in four they have
a little shade finder thing where you
can drag the bar to see what your skin
color is and what your corresponding
foundation shade would be and they only
have three shades on there even though
they have four shades on their website
creamy glow the shade I have isn't even
listed on there so who knows moving past
that so this subscriber I wish I knew
his name I can't remember his name but
he said that 0-8 creamy glow was the
lightest shade and he thought that that
would match me well I went with this
shade alright so watch I am right here
is the Clinique continuous coverage and
creamy glow right here oh no come back
right here is Clinique beyond perfecting
and 0.5 breeze this one's a covergirl
clean matte BB cream and 510 anastasia
beverly hills stick foundation in
porcelain which i do not like i before
view on this jolie stick foundation and
soft cream which I love Maybelline fit
me matte and poreless 110 which I just
did a review on yesterday do you get one
point two ounces of product in here and
it retails for $25 which I feel like is
very reasonably priced especially
considering that a lot of drugstore
foundations are now in like the 1415
dollar range so I'm going to read some
of the claims on here
is an opaque camouflaged liquid makeup
that goes on natural and cover his flaws
birthmarks and scars this is supposed to
be very ideal for acne scarring
hyperpigmentation any kind of major
stuff on your face that you need to
cover up get lasting coverage for every
skin type this opaque makeup died just
right that okay
they just set that twice it can be used
as a concealer or as full face makeup it
provides a physical sunscreen os has SPF
in it and delivers a natural matte
finish it works well with dry to dry
combination skin and oily combination or
oily skin types for special occasions so
it sounds like it's supposed to work for
every kind of skin type that is all the
claims on the foundation if you're
liking 15 days foundation don't forget
to give this video a thumbs up at any
point while you're watching if you
haven't seen them or haven't purchased
one yet the 15 days of foundation
t-shirts are here half of all the
proceeds are going to project BB share
which is an organization that helps
women in transition and women in need
made a whole separate video talking
about what they do and all that good
stuff so that video will be linked down
below along with where you can purchase
your 50 days foundation t-shirt who
literally didn't just for you if you
want to see how the Clinique continuous
coverage makeup applies and wears out
the day you're in the right place just
keep watching all right let's do this
drinking tea today instead of my third
cup of coffee what is going on I have my
dampened Real Techniques diamond sponge
right here and then my Sigma f80
I'm going to do one on one side of my
face one on the other like usual here is
the Box really exciting so far do you
wash moisturize primed face jouer anti
blush matte primer go ahead and put some
of this out on my palette have no idea
how much of this we're going to use is
supposed to be super opaque full
coverage the deal I think I'm just going
to start by dotting some on my face and
let's use a brush on this side to start
oh heck yeah it's weird the way it
blends out it doesn't feel like a
foundation but it's not super super
stiff like if you're trying to put a
concealer all over your face we've got
almost completely full coverage off of
that one layer in like 10 seconds I'm
think I put any down here so I'm just
going to dab some
so far that's looking really nice as
like a satin finish one layer really
awesome coverage you know house really
intense coverage it doesn't look heavy
right now it's just like sitting on my
skin really nice so I'm just going to go
straight in with the sponge and put some
on my face oh man
such good coverage shade a little dark I
think it can work if you're lighter than
I am this will probably be too dark you
might need to make something in with it
but balm coverage that literally just
covered everything so brush versus
sponge they both look amazing I think I
actually might have gotten better
coverage with the sponge a little bit
this looks frickin flawless this looks
good you guys I might just set my cheeks
with powder just so I can blend on top
of it if it doesn't completely set on
its own i want to put powder on top
because the finish looks so beautiful
right now and I feel like the put powder
it might get a little bit heavy looking
is 10:04 so we're gonna call the
check-in time ten o'clock getting a late
start because there were literally guys
again outside the window for two hours
this morning so I'm going to do the rest
my makeup and I'll be right back alright
so it is now 10:50 took my sweet time
doing makeup today because I'm actually
taking photos for something super
exciting after finished filming this so
I'm gonna tell you was on the rest of my
face in a second but you guys this
foundation looks frickin flawless the
finish of it and the way it's sitting on
my skin reminds me of the stick
foundation the Jolie stick foundation I
did a review on this looks just
beautiful on camera and I feel like in
real life the texture of it just kind of
melts into my skin I did end up setting
my cheeks with the Laura Geller double
take baked powder in porcelain I just
set my cheek area with that so I could
blend stuff on top
because it didn't feel like it really
set and then I also just used whatever
was left over on my powder brush and
just dabbed it right on the center of my
face it doesn't look too heavy where I
put the powder on just kind of mattified
it a little bit more since this is
completely full coverage I feel like
this might be nice for a special events
depending on how last so I'm going to do
a flash test just so you can see it has
SPF in it it's only SPF 15 so I'm hoping
we don't get a bounce back looks pretty
dang good in flash photography I think
the one place I got a little bit bounce
back was underneath my eye where I had
powder no complaints at all right now it
looks really good I'm super excited
about this I hope it holds up really
well throughout the day all right so
super quick on the rest of my face I
used the elf eyebrow kit to contour then
I put a little bit of the hourglass
luminous bronze light over the top just
to kind of warm up my face a little bit
blush I use a tiny bit of the makeup
revolution vivid baked blush in make
love instead highlight is Ofra you globe
roll dupe that CLAB all of my eye shadow
is from the morphe buy kathleenlights
palette I've been really liking this I'm
wearing a lot of collabs right now
lashes that are like literally up to my
brows right now but I'm kind of feeling
them our Koko lashes risque positions
for my eye booster lips Urban Decay
Naked lipstick with a little bit of the
wet and wild color icon lipgloss in
Jackie O a mode fingers crossed this
holds out well throughout the day the
next trick and I do will be in natural
lighting so you can see how it looks in
a few hours
check-in time is 10 o'clock I will be
back alright so it is now 4 o'clock
ish yeah 4 o'clock so the Foundation's
been on for 6 hours kind of failed at
doing a check in a couple hours ago got
really sad tracked in now we're here so
we're in semi natural lighting this is
like my room lighting which has kind of
 lighting but I can't go out in a
living room right now let's take a look
at the foundation I think it looks
pretty dang good a little bit of
creasing on the upper lip but nothing
major anywhere really I feel like my oil
is pretty under control it doesn't look
super oily I'm gonna zoom you guys
my forehead looks really good
there's definitely some creasing around
my nose right here is like wearing off a
little around my nose shade wise I do
think it is a bit dark I think next time
I use it I'll probably mix it in with
something a little bit lighter so right
now no complaints I'm going to keep this
on and I will check back in throughout
the night I arm is freaking sore from
holding up this camera right now alright
so it is the end of the night it is now
9:30 where'd the time go 9:30 so
foundations went on for almost 12 hours
long check in let's take a look see how
it's looking it's definitely oxidized a
ton I don't think it's showing up on
camera how dark it is in real life but
my chin looks freaking orange I don't
know why but down here it looks super
dark I do look oily on the center of my
face chin I think next time I'm just
gonna set my whole face with the powder
upper lip and stuff looks good no
creasing really I'm definitely gonna
have to mix this in with something
lighter if you're pale this one will be
too dark unless you mix it in with
something I love the way that this goes
on I love the coverage this is one of
the highest coverage foundations I've
found I think think the biggest thing is
that I just looked early overall I
really liked this one I think is worth
giving it a go if you want something
that has really insane coverage if
you're not someone who needs a ton of
coverage don't go for this I think this
is really for the people that want full
full coverage I think this would be fine
on more mature skin since it didn't
really settle into any lines dry skin I
think might be okay and then oily skin
and obviously just use a powder so I
hope you guys liked this video if you
did make sure to give it a thumbs up
love you guys thanks for watching see
you tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
