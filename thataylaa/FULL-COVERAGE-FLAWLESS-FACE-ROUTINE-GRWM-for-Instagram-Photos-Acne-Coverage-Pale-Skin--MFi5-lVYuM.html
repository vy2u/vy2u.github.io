jacket in 90-degree heat
all right so today I'm going to be
taking some photos for the gram my
Instagram is the same as my YouTube
username Twitter Facebook I'm going to
pop it in right here but I figured I
would bring you guys along show you how
I get ready when I take photos I'm
really excited to show you guys this
foundation routine that I've been doing
looks especially flawless in photos and
just in real life I feel like this is
the most smoothing kind of blurring
foundation combo I've ever had if you
have acne or texture this is full
coverage it'll cover everything and I'm
not going to just kind of smooth
everything out and last throughout the
day I really want to take photos for
Instagram it's during the day we're not
using flash photography so space routine
isn't for flash photography let me know
if you guys want to see a separate video
on that it can be a little bit tricky to
find makeup that photographs well
sometimes in real life it'll look
flawless and then it just doesn't
translate as well on camera so I have
already taken pictures in this face
combo and it looks good on camera
I'm gonna show you guys how I do my
makeup for photos without flash so I
hope you guys enjoy this video if you do
while you're watching don't forget to
give it a thumbs up all the products I'm
using on my face are listed down below
the description box along with Jacket
nail polish everything else
let's put makeup on my face rule number
one for Instagram photos and for life
copy so my skin and foundation routine
today is going to be pretty much the
exact same what I did for the photo
shoot with Elizabeth
because my foundation looks pretty damn
good that day it held up really well and
we are out in the heat and the Sun
turned out looking really good in photos
as well so start with the uLTA Beauty
matte makeup setting spray are you spray
this on my face it gives you actually
like a glow that is supposed to help
kind of keep you matte throughout the
day control your oil right now it has
like a khaki feel to it which I like
putting makeup on top of it I feel like
it sticks a little bit better but I'm
actually going to go in with a second
primer this is the Revlon Photoready
pore reducing primer this I feel like
actually blurs your pores or helps to so
I'm just going to put a tiny bit on it
on my t-zone basically doesn't make your
pores like invisible if you find
something that does let me know it
definitely helps like tone them down
fill them in a little bit and blur them
out well I just used like every
preposition so the makeup that I wear in
that photo shoot with the milk makeup
blur liquid foundation I have a whole
review on this I've been like infatuated
with this fig lately this is the
lightest shade for whatever reason the
first few times I wear this it didn't
oxidize and then just this past time I
wore it it majorly oxidized so I don't
know if it's a powder combination that I
mixed it with but today I'm actually
going to mix in a tiny bit of German
coal 2:08
just to lighten it a bit so that when it
oxidizes it matches me better derma call
on its own looks beautiful and
photography if we don't need to be
wearing it like 10 plus hours you're
just going to be taking photos for a
couple hours
this foundation looks beautiful plate
full coverage I have a for review on it
it just looks super smooth and melts
makeup foundation on my skin if you have
a lot of texture or acne it has full
coverage and it just smooths out your
skin which is why I like it for photos
cuz foundation works pretty well with
any brush but I'm going to use it with
the elf ultimate blending brush and just
mix these two together don't believe the
melt makeup has SPF in it so it should
be good for flash photography as well I
haven't tried it for flash I guess I'd a
try and avoid flash photography at all
cost
look at that freaking coverage this
foundation just gives me old feels so as
you can see the finish right now is
pretty satin dewy
both of those foundations are I still
have a lot left over on the palette I
probably could have mixed like half of
that amount
both of these foundations are full
coverage and go really far so you need
less product and normal by the way I'm
going for like the jean jacket red
it's kind of look messy hair hence also
like basics hair down to only once an
extension yep cool brendor eye concealer
my favorites are the BH Studio Pro
concealer heart-shaped tape Urban Decay
Naked skin those are like my top 3 and
then also the collection cosmetics this
one is harder to get if you're in the US
but it's drugstore and UK you can get it
off eBay have talked about it a ton
before but lately I've just been
reaching for this one again something
about this concealer that is so
beautiful
yesterday I randomly use my F 82 by
Sigma to blend out my concealer and it
actually worked really well so I'm going
to try that again today is obviously a
huge brush but if you just go kind of
like over your eye with it it works you
get powder whether it be under eye
setting powder face powder powders the
trickiest thing when it comes to
especially flash photography like I said
I'm not going to be doing any flash
photography today so I'm not super
concerned about it but I wanted to
mention if you are concerned about flash
photography the three kind of
ingredients main ingredients that you
want to avoid are zinc oxide titanium
dioxide and silica you especially have
to look out for that and loose
translucent kind of powders the one
powder like that that's known to do
pretty well with flashback is the RCM a
no color powder this one typically does
not cause flash back so if you're in the
market for powder for flash photography
here you go so to set my under eyes I'm
gonna use my usual Physicians Formula
powders if I was doing flash I would not
use these because they do contain
titanium dioxide and zinc oxide
alright so this powder I'm in love with
I've talked about it multiple times this
is my favorite way to set this
foundation definitely helps to control
my oil throughout the day it just looks
so smooth and beautiful this is a
Maybelline fit me loose powder and 0-5
so I use the morphe sponge the bottom of
this just to set my entire face I just
really like press it in there and make
sure every inch is covered and it ends
up looking flawless
I just recently like coat the bottom of
this sponge in the powder I'm just going
to pounce it on the face it gives you a
little bit of color and coverage and
this is a dry sponge by the way I know
if you guys will be able to tell on
camera but here's the side not set super
dewy glowy here's this side of my face
set very matte but what I like is that
in about an hour the dew will still kind
of come through
with this foundation it won't look
totally matte but it definitely helps to
keep my oil under control
I don't bake with this because I don't
wipe anything away I just literally
press the putter into my skin protip
don't wear the shirt that you're going
to wear in photos because you'll have
this powder all over it right now that
my base is on there and looking good
we're going to move on to brows so for
brows lately I've been going back to the
Anastasia dip brow and then for the
front of my brows I'll kind of draw on
some like fake lines with this brow
liner by Makeup Forever so I'm gonna do
that hope it goes well you never really
know it's gross
I've been especially having trouble
lately with my brows I don't know why
the shape and everything I'm just like
going through one of those phases right
not a horrible brow J so you can really
ask for in life not a horrible brow day
I'm going to go in and draw some of
those lines on next up I'm going to go
in with my contour this is the kevin
klein celestial bronzing veil this
beautiful mentioned it in rays and
rejects I might also bronze with this
one today but I'm just going to go with
a really light shade right here just
contour by the way this is a morphe g4d
I've been liking this one for contouring
lately and if you get too much or you
feel like you need to tone it down you
can always go back and with your brush
or sponge and just kind of blend out
those edges a little bit also getting
the tips of my nose with this typically
would use the Kat Von D brush I have no
idea where that is though can't find it
then I also go underneath the lip this
just creates a little shadow under there
to make your lips look bigger I think I
do want to bronze a little bit so I'm
going to take the elf st. Lucia bronzer
with my flower Beauty brush to love this
thing
so pretty
I love the tone of this bronzer so I
don't know actually if I want to do
blush today I'm going to do highlight
billet first go in for eyes so I'm going
to prime using Mac's Paint Pot and soft
ochre I wish you guys could see my skin
in real life because it never looks this
smooth usually in the viewfinder with
the license tough it like kind of
smooths out my skin a little bit but it
actually looks like that in real life
which is rare so I feel like this
foundation combo is just great so for
eyes I'm going to use the Jaclyn hill
morphe palette I'm just going to use
some of the mass today just to create
like a really basic neutral kind of eyes
I want to do a red lip I'm gonna start
out with this shade right here this like
orangie one and just put that into the
crease this palette hasn't grown on me
found myself reaching for it more than I
thought I was going to it's one of those
palettes that you definitely need a
primer for so Mac Paint Pot is my
favorite primer to use this with you
have putted lids this pH brush is like
kind of a game-changer it's small enough
where it's precise you can place the
product exactly where you want it but it
also blends a little bit this is number
seven I think you can only get it in a
set but I'll put it in the description
box down below I think I'm going to go
in with this shade right here just put
that right into the crease I do draw it
a little bit above my crease since I
have hooded lids you got to kind of
create that line since it doesn't exist
when are you putting on falsies today so
I'm not super concerned with the eye
shadow because usually when your eyes
are open you mostly see this all please
would highly recommend wearing false
lashes if you're going to be taking
photos just make your eyes really pop so
are false lashes make any makeup look 50
times better I'm going to go in and
blend that out so for my lid shade
there's not a matte cream shade in this
palette so I'm going to go in with a BH
Carli bybel palette one of my favorites
I'm going take the slightest cream shade
right here this one I love for the lid
I'm just going to bring this right into
the crease and create kind of like a
sharp line right there
the shadow is done I'm debating whether
I want to use liner or not today so when
you use the Pierre bottom chill lashes
which are one of my favorites I love
these in the aisle or 121 so they're
like my go-to lashes these ones I like
how they look without liner on they have
a nice dark band too so I usually don't
need it yeah
think I'm going to use liner today for
false lashes actually I'm going to go in
with highlighters I'm going to mix the
two lightest eyeshadow shades in this
palette these are beautiful as safe
Tyler's especially this shade so this is
the lightest shade on its own you can
see that frickin Sheen it is so pretty
actually might just use this shade today
for photos unless you're going to be
photoshopping the out of your face
I'd have to put on more than you
normally would so it shows up how you
want it to in photos on Instagram I've
like three different apps I use edit my
photos I do use facetune to help kind of
like smooth out your skin a little bit
most people on Instagram do it's no
secret I love this shade as a base
highlight so pretty all right so I'm
gonna apply myself lashes I'll be right
back alright so false lashes are on I'm
going to go in for the lower lash line
now I'm gonna go back in with that first
shade that I check actually I'm going to
a second shade actually that we took go
and blend that on the lower lash line a
little bit what when your is hella far
right now I'm going to take that
shimmery lightest shade in the palette
and use that as an inner corner
highlight so pretty
last step rise I'm going to go in for
bottom mascara use my wet and wild
Magelang for this the wand is perfection
it doesn't transfer down to my concealer
it dries down alright so Instagram kind
of hack because it does take time and
coordination to do a photo shoot you
have to get someone to take your photos
you got your makeup as the guy outfits
all of that I definitely like to take
advantage of that and get a couple
different looks out of it so typically
I'll do two different lip colors I'll
kind of switch it up so whatever
lightest lip color and when you're
wearing I'll put on first and then
halfway through the photo shoot I'll
switch lips so if I wanted to do like
red lip today I would probably put on a
nude first with a different outfit then
do an outfit change then do the red but
I think today I'm actually going to
start out with a red and then switch to
like a dark dark either dark purple
almost black color so I'm going to use
the Smashbox always on liquid lipstick
and bang bang
I've been tried this shade yet but the
formula Z's are friggin awesome by the
way before I put on the false lashes I
set my whole face with the makeup rep
for mist and fix is my favorite setting
spray for taking photos for events
anytime I need my makeup to full-on stay
on this stuff is legit it's awesome oh
yeah I always like using liquid
lipsticks or photos because you don't
have to wear
about it like transferring on your teeth
it's going to stay on your lips this red
shade is so freaking pretty I feel like
it looks a little bit more neon on
camera but in real life this is like the
perfect Matt woo I like this color a lot
wouldn't be Instagram without a little
bit of a glow I'm going to use the
Maybelline strobing liquid just for my
chest area we're going to put this right
on my color boom alright so this is the
finished look
basic but effective
the space makeup should be looking
pretty flawless all day definitely
recommend the foundation of powder
combination everything I used on my face
today will be linked down below in the
description box I think this is going to
be my outfit for the photos I'm going to
pop on some sunglasses I hope you guys
