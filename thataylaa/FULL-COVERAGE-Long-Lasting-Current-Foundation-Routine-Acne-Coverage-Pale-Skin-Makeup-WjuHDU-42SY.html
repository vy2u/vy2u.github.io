just chillin on my bed I couldn't marry
a brush it would be this like look how
how huge this is it's a freaking
microphone alright so today we are going
to be talking about what I've been
putting on my face every single day I
usually have like foundation ad D where
I try a new foundation literally every
day but the past month or month and a
half ish I have actually been sticking
to a routine that's been working really
well for me if you need my channel I
have very acne prone a combination skin
I've cystic acne the links on my acne
videos down below so you can kind of
hear my whole skin story if you're
interested but this is a foundation
routine for the people who want amazing
full coverage and you want your
foundation to stay on all day this is a
pretty glowy luminous finish it's just
what I've been feeling lately so if you
guys want to hear about my favorite
products and what I've been using you're
in the right place just keep watching
alright so I've already washed
moisturized and primed my face I use a
Polish twice moisturizer it's like this
one for acne but it has SPF in it I'll
put it in the description box if you're
curious but that's why I use for
moisturizer favorite primer which I
mentioned before is the ultimate in
prime this is what I've been using every
single day all these products I've been
using pretty much almost every day for
the last month and a half month this is
a really nice smoothing primer I don't
think it helps with mattifying but it
does make your foundation glide on makes
your face feel super smart smooth well
so going for their soft who I used to
max body wash and I smell like a dude
right now so let's just jump in this has
just been what's been working for my
skin so for foundation I'm taking the
Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation in the
shade 10 I have a full review on this
product really love this foundation it's
an amazing amazing full coverage
foundation if you have pale skin the
show you ten is light enough it's
actually too light for me which is why I
started mixing it with this fat boy this
is the cosmetics CC plus illumination
this has an SPF 50 which is really nice
really nice coverage with this some
people will find that they're just like
glitter in this I don't see that at all
for me it's just a really nice
illuminated dewy glow I do one pump of
this
almost add this thing and then I kind of
just opened this guy shake it and then
the way I get this product out is I just
use my finger and take a little bit off
of the end so I'm just mixing these on
the back of a pallet this is like about
how much of the Marc Jacobs foundation I
take it has super full coverage so
mixing these and this is like a perfect
shade for me when these two are mixed a
little bit on the light side but I do
that on purpose because I'm going to go
in with a powder that's a little bit too
dark my skin pretty horrible right now
let's just show you a for a sec so I
have some major breakouts going on right
now
kind of talked about a skincare update
in what video is that it was my last
shot on shmoo this or something by the
way this is the morphe e31 love this
brush for foundation if I'm not using
that brush I'm using the elf I think
this is the selfie I think it's actually
a powder brush but it works amazing for
my foundation both work great for this
combo and as you can see this has really
good coverage carving up everything in
that last video where I talked about my
skin I told you guys I was going on
accutane I am still going on accutane
but now I'm waiting until the end of
August because I have a ton of
trips coming up I'm just not going to be
in town enough for all the blood tests
and doctor visits and stuff you have to
do in the meantime of going back on
spironolactone I'm not on the same
migraine medication that I was on last
time so I'm hoping I don't get a
reaction again that's why I stopped
spironolactone last time so I have
combination skin it does get quite oily
in my t-zone throughout the day so this
combination if you have similar skin to
mine or a few if your foundation breaks
down throughout the day this should last
pretty well my foundation looks pretty
dang good all day I usually put on my
makeup at about 6:30 a.m. for work and
it's good until like 9 p.m. or 10 p.m.
at night I love the tone of the
cosmetics foundation and if you're
looking for a good brand that does not
break you out it cosmetics man it's
freaking amazing when my skin was at its
best I was using it
medics scene is just really bizarre last
week I almost took photos and I wish I
did because my skin was like clear
literally a week ago my skin was
completely clear like nada singles it
just acne and scarring and then this
week it's like a frickin acne volcano
exploded acne volcano that's a new one
so if I feel like I need a little bit
more coverage which I kind of do right
now I just take a tiny bit of the Marc
Jacobs and just dab it on the end here
and just go over some of the spots where
I feel like I need a little more
coverage I'm in such a filming mood and
I think I'm just going to be going to
target after this I've heard that
they're really good stuff at the dollar
spot right now so I'm gonna go check it
out see what targets all about that
rhymed so I'm not gonna do anything too
crazy with my eye makeup or anything
okay so I love the finish that this
gives it's a nice illuminating glow but
not too oily looking this is the
collection cosmetics concealer in the
lightest shade and my thing is like
totally worn off I ordered these on eBay
concealer is freaking amazing it's full
coverage really nice consistency I like
the color on my skin tone the only thing
is you have to order it on eBay so I
literally have like three backups coming
because I'm obsessed with this pink
collection is kind of like a wet and
wild someone commented like that's kind
of what they're known for like they're
more affordable but this is balm so I
just like to first blend it out with my
fingers I feel like I get the best
coverage with concealer when I blend it
out with my finger then I just take the
morphe g1 brush and just blend that in a
little bit better I do like to apply my
concealer at down the center of my face
so I'm putting that on the forehead
bringing it down the nose chin and I
just use the brush for this if you're
new to my channel I have a ton of
foundation videos showing you guys how
to cover up acne and if you have pale
skin
I feel ya the struggle is real leave a
playlist for my peel skin videos
Foundation reviews down below and so the
baby wipes I've been using these morphe
makeup removing things because they're
pretty shitty these do not remove my
face makeup so now I'm just using them
for removing makeup for my hands so to
set the under eyes I've been using the
stargazer powder mention this before too
this is a pressed white powder and the
consistency of this is really nice for
being a pure white powder usually
they're kind of like tell key and hey a
pit pan always an exciting day when you
hit the end I wouldn't recommend this
probably if you don't have pale skin but
if you do and you have a hard time
finding an under-eye powder that's light
enough try this out you can get on
Amazon it's literally five or six
dollars like what it just brightens up
under there it sets everything makes it
look super flawless and to apply that I
use the elf brush a link this down below
- they don't put the names of their
brushes down there down there on here I
am NOT someone who bakes
I've tried baking I've tried the Laura
Mercier powder under my eyes I've tried
translucent powders under my eyes and
loose powders and there's something
about it that it takes away all of the
coverage of my concealer I don't know
what it is but baking does not work on
me at all so for me the it cosmetics CC
cream isn't super long-lasting so
whenever I wear this or mix it in I do
set my face to cars that I've been
obsessively only for setting my face are
the cover effects illuminating setting
powder this is one of the only loose
powders I found that actually gives me
coverage I love the finish of this the
color is beautiful I mentioned this in
my last favorites video if you didn't
purchase this seriously buy it I love
this stuff today I'm actually gonna be
using the a cosmetic celebration
foundation illumination powder because I
don't know just feeling it this is what
I've been using for the last like week
before that I was using this I just
switch off this powder is beautiful also
hit pan on this gives you a really nice
finish and I like that because I hate
when you have to set your foundation and
then it takes away the finish
the liquid foundation that you put on
and it has good coverage the brush I'm
using is a Coastal Scents brush it's
like five dollars and I love this for
powder I feel like this gives me the
best coverage out of any powder brush
I've ever used
always link all the brushes I use all
the products I use in the description
box below and you better read it because
description box literally takes me like
an hour to fill out every time this is a
little bit too dark for my skin tone
which is why I make the foundation a
little bit light so once I put this on
everything just looks normal and it's a
good shade so next I go in for contour
and somedays I contour somedays I put
bronze around some days that don't do
anything lately I've been really
enjoying this this is a physician's
formula super VB insta ready this is
like borderline a little orange e for me
but I feel like it just gives me warmth
to my face and you have to really like
layer this stuff on which I kind of like
because if you want more of a subtle
look you can just stop here you have a
little bit of bronze going if you want
more of a intense look you can keep
packing that on
I don't usually put any bronzer on my
temples I don't know just what I do so
this I have a love affair with this is
the elf illuminating palette mention
this in favourites videos and on
Instagram and everywhere this is a so
nice this is the elf I just say that
alpha lumen ating palette this shade if
you have fair skin stunning makes you
glow just gives this really nice
brightening effect the consistency of
these are pretty dang powdery so if you
don't like that then you probably won't
like this but the color and everything
just works really nicely for my skin
tone so I just go in with that lightest
white shade plop that over here and look
at bag below I'm just in love with this
and you put it a little bit of this on
the tip of my nose and then Cupid's bow
then I go in with blush been using this
guy every single day this is the
covergirl trublend blush in the shade
medium rose so beautiful I love the
shade I use this in my Mad Men tutorial
it just gives such a pretty rosy pink
like flushed look which I'm all about
blush brush is morphe 34 and so soft so
yeah blush tone it up over here then I
go in with the king of all brushes look
at this guy this is the morphe 41 and oh
my god if I could marry a brush it would
be this like look at how huge this is
it's a freaking microphone there are so
many bristles in here that are just so
densely packed this brush is amazing
it's so soft and I just go in and blend
oh my god it feels so good I just blend
all that makes the blush look a little
bit less intense so last step before I
do the rest of my makeup is I going with
my setting spray I've been using too
lately because high-maintenance I use
this one mostly just on like the center
of my face I do a couple spritzes when I
use
to make sure that the rest of my face is
fully covered this stuff does burn my
eyes if I open them before to dry but it
legit works it gives you a really nice
glowy look attempt to find the other
bottle layers I suppose I'm like out of
this one so don't open your eyes before
the Make Up For Ever one is fully dry so
I'm going to apply the rest of my makeup
and I will be right back alright so once
all of my makeups done this is what it
looks like I don't usually wear a winged
eyeliner during the week but this is
pretty much what my face looks like if I
do if not I do everything except the
wing and just wear mascara all the
products I used even the ones I didn't
show you guys are linked down below and
if some of these items are more on the
pricey side especially the Marc Jacobs
remarkable but honestly that thing is so
great and you literally need the tiniest
bit in the last you for forever if
you're someone who doesn't have acne you
could literally get away with like a dot
for your whole face for me it's worth it
because it's pale and it covers acne
which is really hard to find if you guys
liked this video and it was helpful for
you give it a thumbs up so I know love
you guys thanks for watching see you my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
