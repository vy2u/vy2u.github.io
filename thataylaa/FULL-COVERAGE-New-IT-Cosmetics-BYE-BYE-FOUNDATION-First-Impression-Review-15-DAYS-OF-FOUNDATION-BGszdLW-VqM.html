on right now I look very McDonald's
right now all right it's day average
time it rises - dog barks - Doug you
okay that sounds like a Sat park all
right so today
can I come hug you it is day five of 15
days of foundation this is where I try
out a new foundation every single day
for 15 days March 15th to 29th days one
through four I link down below in season
fives playlist today we're talking about
a brand new foundation by it cosmetics
this is their byebye foundation full
coverage moisturizer ignore my nails
that are already chipping one day later
this foundation retails for 39 50 and
you get one fluid ounce of product there
are CC cream actually retails for $38 so
this is just a couple dollars more for
whatever reason so they say this is
their first ever full coverage
moisturizer supposed to help cover and
improve the look of skin concerns
including redness pores dark spots
breakouts lines and wrinkles supposed to
flow over lines and wrinkles and feel
like nothing on your skin but cover
everything without creasing or cracking
ideal for all skin types so there are
only twelve shades here I've the
lightest shade which is fair the deepest
shade is deep says deep skin with
neutral undertone
they cosmetics CC cream only has seven
shades so just to give you a little bit
of background with a cosmetics CC creams
in my skin this one I do not like this
one I find to look way too heavy on my
skin a little bit cakey the regular CC
cream the illumination CC cream is one
of my favorite products to either wear
alone or to mix in with stuff when I had
oily skin this is definitely a product
that you need to set and it didn't last
the best on my skin but don't about it
makes your skin look very plump and
healthy I like do a skin I like that
glow a lot of people find that there's
kind of glitter in this one when I saw
that they were coming out with the
bye-bye foundation full coverage
moisturizer
to me it kind of sounds like this like a
full-coverage moisturizer kind of sounds
like a full-coverage CC cream you know
what I'm saying ingredients are very
similar in these the shade fair and this
one too this is actually the shade light
right here because I ran out of fair I
have to restock so I'm gonna soak those
swatches right now so you can see how
these three shades compared to some of
my other foundations
I've got swatches up the arm right now
cuz I'm doing a few days in one here
here's it cosmetics bye bye foundation
in the lightest shade fair next overs a
cosmetics CC cream in the lightest shade
fair there is a little bit of difference
in the undertones of these two shades
this is the cosmetics CC illumination
cream in the shade light because I'm out
of the shade fair so this is the second
up shade in that obviously quite a bit
darker than the first lighter shades
there's a big shade jump there next over
is a cover FX custom cover drops in n10
Marc Jacobs remarkable in lightest shade
10 cover FX power play foundation in P
20 NARS radiant foundation in Montblanc
CYO life proof in 101 derma called 2:08
and Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
in 110 I also have a review on the can't
remember what it was called off the top
of my head but the bye-bye foundation I
think it was just the compact one like
the cream foundation don't link that

at the link down below for the winning
shelter okay I have no idea have so much
energy this morning it's 703 right now I
was up at like 6 o'clock and literally
just popped out of bed but we're gonna
roll with it
I've already washed moisturize and
prepped my face as I was doing that I
had a little Sarah Bay disaster
literally squirt face wash all down my
arm into my hair like half the bottle
SEC you see remnants black hair problems
so at this easy illumination cream I
typically like to use a brush with this
we're still gonna do half face with a
brush half face with it sponge this
looks like almost the same packaging
this one is just like a tiny bit smaller
actually I love the packaging of this
because it's easy to travel with you
have this squeeze tube but you also have
a pump so it's not gonna break or
anything so let's start out with a brush
on this side of my face I was out on the
lake yesterday and got a little bit
sunburned
what's looking a lot better today
yesterday I was like a friggin tomato
smells exactly like the other CC creams
okay that's looking nice
okay I'm gonna drag this over cuz I just
got too much and blend it out with a
sponge on my forehead with a brush on my
forehead it doesn't look bad but I'm
definitely gonna use this sponge and
just smooth this out doesn't look like
total full coverage to me that is
sitting on my skin and dryness and
everything really nice it's a lot dear
than I was expecting
sponge time it smells very spa-like it
is pretty centered that bothers you this
scent doesn't totally bother me for some
reason it kind of smells just like fresh
and I've never found that because my
dick's products break me out ever if
anything the it cosmetics CC creams
actually I feel like every time I've
worn this for a significant amount of
time like stuck with that I was my sole
foundation my skin has actually gotten
better I've talked about that years ago
that is like one of the foundations that
I feel like has actually helped my skin
in the past now it's hard for me to
stick with the foundation that much
because I'm doing things like this
sponge side works too I feel like I got
about the same coverage for me this one
doesn't look like full coverage off of
one layer it's not covering my scarring
or freckles I'm going to try and just
build this up a little bit since I
already have some out here and I'm gonna
use the brush to do that I do like how
it applied better with the brush I feel
like the finish looks about the same but
a little bit better on the brush side so
I'm gonna build this up just on spots I
need it and you can build the CC cream
up to full coverage I was kind of
expecting this one to be a little bit
more full coverage off the go this side
is looking like a little bit more
textured or something okay so I just
added a tiny bit right in this area and
it still hasn't totally covered all this
so I don't think I would call this one
full coverage it did build a bit but if
you're going into this thinking this is
like ultra full coverage just not I
would say it's about the same cover just
a CC cream a little bit disappointing
because that's basically the difference
factor here I almost feel like this one
builds a little bit better like I can
get this one to total full coverage this
one I mean I can still see stuff I don't
not like how it looks I actually think
it looks really nice on the skin again
very similar to this
I'm actually not seeing like a huge
difference between the two this one is
very dewy we'll see if it gets a little
bit less dewy as it sets but the finish
yeah it feels very similar to that one
too has like a tacky finish this one
when I had oily skin I would definitely
have to set now that I have dry skin I
don't set it and that's what I'm gonna
do with this one as well it's just set
this part it is looking a little bit
almost like to do e oil e around my nose
area so I might set a little bit right
there too
but typically on my dry skin now when I
do that it looks too cakey right there
we'll see it we'll see how it sets down
if you already have this product at this
point I don't feel like you really need
this one but we'll see how wears
throughout the day this one might hold
up better but the shade is looking good
yeah I like the shade of it it looks
really nice on my skin it's not clinging
anywhere even around I have major
dryness right here and a little bit on
this side and it's not clinging at all
right there so right now at 7:19 I'm
gonna do the rest of my makeup drink
some coffee he'll be right back now 7:55
we're gonna call check-in times 730
since that's when I finish up with my
face I just did super basic makeup so
I'm about to go to a brunch breakfast
thing I feel like I'm already crashing
it's not even 8:00 I have kind of mixed
feelings right now my forehead it's not
even that it looks too dewy it's just
not Tom's making me look like older or
something it just looks like it's kind
of sitting on top of my skin down here
where I powdered it looks fine it looks
a little bit heavy I got a clip in
natural lighting so you guys can see and
I did see when I looked really in-depth
and was like staring at my forehead I
did see a couple specks of glitter as I
was moving my head we have Sun out today
so that's a rarity maybe that's why I
don't usually see the glitter but
directly in the sunlight I could see
like literally two specks of glitter
that doesn't bother me at all because I
really don't think you would notice it
unless you were staring at your forehead
there's something about this that I'm
not liking right now just kind of
surprised me like I don't know it just
looks like it's already separating on my
forehead kind of debating whether I want
to set my forehead or not but I think
because I don't like it how it is right
now and I wouldn't wear it how it is
right now so let's go ahead and do that
I'm just using my same laura geller
balance in Brighton powder this was on
hot look the other day for like 18 bucks
so I just bought it back oaks I'm
already hitting pan on this I'm not
gonna do right on the center I'm just
doing where it looks extra should be
which is up here from far away it looks
better let me go close okay there we go
definitely a bit better
I took a flash test before I just
powdered my face I'm gonna cert that
right here definitely in flash back
there was SPF 50 in this product so kind
of expected wouldn't wear this for flash
photography it also gave quite a bit of
shine right on the center of my forehead
right now I'm kind of indifferent to
this one right now I'm thinking if you
have this you probably don't need the
other one so on the rest of my face not
that anyone probably cares because it's
very basic but I use the butter bronzer
in the shade bronzer he's the butter
blush also by Physicians Formula in the
shade vintage Rouge whenever I use these
two products together like they're
butter bronzer in their blush everything
just blends so easily
you smell like coconuts it's a good
start to the day is a new NARS
highlighter again but in the shade
albatross this time no I think he's the
same shade name very pretty if you like
a yellow toned white shade as a
highlighter but also to use my lips were
boring I used like the same thing I've
been using I used L'Oreal tongue-tied
with the Maybelline vivid hot lacquer in
tease and that's oh and then eyeliner I
just smudged the L'Oreal infallible this
brown shade in brown just smudge that on
the top and bottom put it on my
waterline and then popped on my Too
Faced better than sex mascara and that's
all it's on my eyes I almost put on
false lashes again today the half ones
because did anyone notice I actually
kept those on all day yesterday
throughout the video I think that might
be the first wear test video I've done
where I actually kept my lashes on the
entire day we'll see how this holds up
throughout the day
next check and I do will be in after
lighting so I'll see you guys in a few
hours alright so I just got home it's 2
o'clock so it's been on for about six
and a half hours so it looks good it
looks like a satin finish at this point
I don't think I look too shiny on the
forehead that this is like a good amount
of radiant to me I feel like without a
powder it looks like Gracie just a bit
too dewy so I'm getting creasing right
here I was just doing a lot of talking
smiling so it did settle in right there
not bad on my upper lip as far as
creasing and then here's the center of
my forehead my forehead looks pretty
good I think I'm gonna go work out but
I'm just gonna walk on the treadmill for
like an hour so I'm not gonna be like
majorly breaking a sweat I just drank so
much dr. pepper so I'm like wired right
now so see you guys at the end of the
night it's 6:30 so it's now been on for
11 hours I did work out but I just did a
casual stroll no sweat happened watched
a good episode of blood line which by
the way it took them like 12 episodes
for it to finally get good but now it's
now it's turning into an actual show
nothing looks bad I just look hella dry
and a tad heavier than what I like I'm
in kind of a predicament with this one
because I feel like if I didn't set it
it would be so greasy looking which is a
lot to say on dry skin because I find
that that's pretty hard so if you have
anything other than dry skin this is
very very very dewy even if you do have
dry skin it to me looked a little bit
borderline too greasy hence why we
powdered then now I feel like my face
feels and looks really dry this probably
would be kind of a mixing one for me I
don't see myself really wearing this one
again I think what I would do something
like this is mixing like a couple drops
of the Catrice I quit coverage drop
foundation which I've been loving if you
want a matte foundation B of dry skin
just mix in a couple drops of that with
something else something like that is
how I'd probably wear this one if you
have the cosmetics CC illumination I
definitely don't think you need to get
the buy buy foundation and I'm a doing
person like I love a good dewy
foundation it's just a little much is
why I do kind of follow up the wrap up
video where I'm going to try in
different ways then you'll see my final
ranking and that's where I'll tell you
how I did wear it buddy I'm gonna try
the Catrice thing I also might like it
with a powder but then with a ton of
Duty settings bring over top to just add
that moisture back in feels weird
wrapping up a foundation video so early
in the night still have the whole night
to do stuff so I hope you guys enjoyed
