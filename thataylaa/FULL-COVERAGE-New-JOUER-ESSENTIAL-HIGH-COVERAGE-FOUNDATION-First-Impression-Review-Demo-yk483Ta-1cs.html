probably forgot since no one's talked
about this for like ten years alright so
today it is foundation Friday this is
why I try out a new foundation every
single Friday on my channel today we're
talking about a brand new foundation by
jouer every time I say easy way it
sounds so bougie this is the jouer
essential high coverage cream foundation
so this is pretty new came out in last
couple weeks I ended up getting two
shades because I actually ordered the
shade shell which don't ask me why I did
that so that they're over shade which am
I ever the third over shade so I ended
up going with this one got it in the
mail swatched it and it was way too dark
so then I ended up ordering alabaster
alabaster is the lightest shade there is
a shade in between these two shades but
I figured I could mix them if one is too
dark or one is too light that's the
shade situation so this foundation
retails for $38 but you only get 0.68
fluid ounces of product so quite a bit
less than a standard fluid ounce but it
is supposed to be high coverage so maybe
you have to use less than you would a
normal foundation so I ended up getting
this on Beauty lish because I didn't see
it on Sephora or anywhere yet I think
it's only on Joey's website and be
delicious I just love the packaging a
beauty Alicia it's always so exciting
getting a package from there
because I have the cutest tissue paper
and everything it is just very thrilling
so let's be some of the claims on Joy's
website so it says it has supreme
coverage lightweight and long wearing
creates an impeccable airbrush matte
finish instantly
simply spa that's it so how's chamomile
and cucumber extract hyaluronic acid
which is great if you have dry skin try
peptide complex matte oil-free it's whoa
it's all the free is paraben free gluten
free vegan friendly and I believe jus as
cruelty-free let me double check and joy
is cruelty free as well comes in 17
shades but on their website right here
it says more shades coming so comes in
this super intense a reflective gold box
but the packaging is beautiful I love
this it has a frosted glass bottle gold
top I just think it looks really classy
and fancy so that's all of the claims
that was quick and easy I'm gonna start
swatches right here of these two shades
compared to some of the other
Foundations I owned just so you can
compare alright so swatch time right
here the first two shades are the Jew a
high coverage cream foundation the first
one is in the lightest shade alabaster
the second one is in the third two
lightest shade which is shale but there
is a shade in between these two I just
don't have it here to swatch next over
is the Josie Maran vibrancy foundation
in RG 5 laura geller cover lock in
porcelain Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless in 110 and derma called 2:08
which is my closest shade match so if
you're excited for this video and you
enjoy foundation Friday's don't forget
to give this a thumbs up so I know if
you're new here you can join the burrito
family and subscribe upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday at 6 p.m. Pacific time
also don't forget I'm gonna be doing a
meet-up Sunday November 19th 4 p.m. in
Spokane Washington I will have a link
down below I can't wait to meet you guys
it's gonna be so fun so if you want to
know my thoughts on this foundation and
how it applies somewhere throughout the
day you're in the right place just keep
watching I feel like every time I flash
this I just blind you guys and myself in
the viewfinder
dang it definitely having wet my sponge
it BRB ok so we're starting this pretty
late today it's 1223 November 6 so I'm
currently on day 22 no 23 of accutane so
again this one isn't super pre-recorded
because this is a new foundation that I
wanted to get out the lab tests this
morning took two hours longer than I
thought it would hence why we're
starting this in like the middle of the
day so I've already washed moisturize
and prepped my skin I'm not priming it
I'm gonna show you guys what I've been
using well on accutane I've been
starting to get dry but I feel like
these products before my makeup have
been really helping not only the
application of my makeup but just
keeping my skin feeling smooth not
getting super dry I don't really have
any major dryness down here a tiny bit
right here but everywhere else is just
pretty normal I have been getting less
oily throughout the day if you've
watched any of my foundation videos I'm
usually combination oily so I get oily
throughout the day I've been just kind
of more normal which has been really
really great I wish I could just stay
like that but I'm probably gonna be
getting super dry once my dose doubles
next month anyways for about the last
five days maybe a week I've been using
the elta MD moisturizer / sunscreen
sometimes I'll use this Murad
hydrodynamic ultimate moisture this is
really
underneath makeup makes your skin super
smooth and soft doesn't feel like you
have on like a thick moisturizer or
anything and then I'll just kind of like
Pat on a little bit of the pixie
hydrating milky mist over top this is
hyaluronic acid in it today I just use
these two products I'm not gonna be
doing half my face with the primer
because again I've just noticed that
those work really well for underneath my
makeup right now without a primer so
I've only swatch to shade shell so far
one that was a major tongue twister when
I first got it it's way dark so that's
why I ended up ordering alabaster I'm
probably gonna end up mixing these
because after ordered alabaster I
realized that alabaster is apparently
very very fair I don't know I haven't
swatches yet let me give this a shake
sounds pretty liquidy like usual on half
my face I'm gonna use a brush I'm using
this a cosmetics skin smoothing
complexion brush and on the other half
la girl sponge also really liking that
I'm gonna put a little bit of alabaster
out and see how this shade is on my skin
and so you guys can see looks pretty
yellow toned so whenever I put it on my
face is darker and red so I look at my
neck that might be a little bit light
yeah I think I want to mix in a dab of
shell gel is way dark so here's the two
next to each other look cover any that
is I'm mixing about a pump of alabaster
with half a pump of shale that's looking
like a good shade it definitely added
some peachy pink tones yeah that looks
better what's going on this side with
the mixed shade oh that looks like a
good mix this is supposed to be really
high coverage I'm gonna start out with a
brush on this side it's matte but it has
that a really nice almost airbrushed
kind of finish the finish of this looks
really similar to the Catrice drops
liquid coverage drops I tested during 15
eights foundation great coverage
definitely full full coverage and the
finish of this is looking beautiful
especially format sometimes matte
foundations can look pretty cakey on my
skin I did a whole video on extreme
coverage foundations if you have acne
and texture and in that video I kind of
talked about how I usually prefer more
dewy foundations just for that reason I
find them to be more flattering on my
textured skin but this is one of those
matte foundation
that is looking literally airbrushed
even with the brush I'm getting no
strokes or anything in that shade I
think is pretty dang exact whenever I
edit back this footage it looks
different on camera than it does in real
life but I try to get the most accurate
lighting and everything I don't have my
ring light on right now I have the two
windows open it is a constant work in
progress to figure out the best most
accurate lighting and I don't use
filters or any of that on my videos
it's kind of pointless I think I just
dipped my elbow so far it's so freakin
good that is looking bomb I'm excited
right now okay let's try a sponge on the
other side I love the coverage of this
by the way I'm still working off of that
pump and a half and there's still some
left to do the forehead it seems to
drive pretty quick so I would definitely
work in sections with this one a little
bit does go a long way so you should be
able to look kind of spread it but dries
pretty quick like you've been trying to
blend out down here I feel like this is
one of those that you could probably
skip concealer with under-eye concealer
dude holy cease by the way I know
my ears are red is from hot packs ignore
when trying to avoid doing the
foundation right around my nose ring
because I do have a little bump right
there from the makeup so I'm not gonna
bring it right around there so with both
a brush and a sponge the finish looks
pretty identical the coverage I got
literally the smallest amount better
coverage smallest amount a little bit
better coverage on the brush side but
barely noticeable it's still definitely
full coverage on this side applying this
again I would probably go with the brush
side just because it looks so freakin
flawless so up close it looks pretty
good on the center of my forehead I can
see my texture right there a bit it's
not like the most plumping smoothing it
doesn't look the best around my nose
creases I'm going to use a smaller brush
that I usually use for concealer and see
if I can get just right in there a
little bit better that's better I
haven't feeling this is gonna crease
around my nose throughout the day but
that works right now feels like it's
drying down to almost a powder
finish I could definitely blend product
on top of here I'm not gonna powder my
face with this I haven't been using
powder at all most days since my skin
again is more normal
right now I love how it looks so it's
1241 so we're gonna call a check-in time
12:40 I'm gonna do the rest of my makeup
and I'll be right back okay so it's now
120 so it's been on for about 40 minutes
and it has started to settle a little
bit into one of my fine lines up here I
got a shot in natural lighting so you
guys can see how it looks but I still
think it looks really beautiful I
touched my face to see if it was set
down again after 40 minutes and I'm
still getting a little bit of transfer
so it's not transfer resistant or
anything not bad around my nose but this
might be one that I would use kind of
like a smoothing or pore filling primer
up on those areas also a Smashbox primer
water might look really nice under here
alright so on the rest of my face what
did I use I used the boohoo bronzer
palette I talked about this in Monday's
video I think this will be going up in
the same week I tried out a bunch of
boohoo makeup and I've used this a few
times actually since filming that video
and I really like this cool tone shade
in here blushes Max Factor nude mob I
tried out the Physicians Formula butter
highlighter again I've used this also a
few times since I tried this in last
week's foundation Friday video and I
really like this this is beautiful
gives you like a subtle but still you
can build this up to really intense it
doesn't overly emphasize my texture for
eyeshadow I tried out this thing who
remembers this this is like throwback
YouTube right here so this is a
cosmetics naturally pretty palette this
is what it looks like since you probably
forgot since no one's talked about this
for like ten years
I forgot how easily these shadows blend
out but my eyes are kind of burning
right now so I don't know if it's a
shadow or what normal mascaras and then
my lips are Ofra Angeles liquid lipstick
which is such a pretty pinky nude kind
of color everything this on my face is
always listed down below in the
description box I usually do ten hour
wear tests so I'm gonna try and keep
this on until 10:40 tonight which should
be fine cuz I'm gonna be out anyways
I'll see you guys in a few hours okay so
right now it's five o'clock so it's been
on for a little over four hours let's
take a look so it's art he freaking dark
out like pitch-black out the Sun just
set 20 minutes ago I don't know why but
my eyes are
profusely watering today if it's a
shadow or what right now I just some in
front of the light softbox thing by the
way just to get some light going see you
guys and see things looks a bit more
textured actually on my forehead which
is kind of weird like I slipped more
texture it throughout the day there's a
little bit of separation right there
just a tiny bit and then it's still kind
of settling right there on my lines but
my upper lip looks pretty good for me I
usually get more creasing than that and
then I'm getting a little creasing right
there I'm not getting oily I would say
the finish is still matte it looks a
little bit more like satin matte at this
point which I really like and that is
that so I'm gonna go over to my friends
house right now we're gonna watch
shameless season premiere I'm so excited
and then I'll check back in with you
guys when I get back here later tonight
why am i so bright there we go okay so
it's 10:00 nope 11 o'clock now so it's
been on for over 10 hours at this point
I just got back home so here's a look at
my face it looks pretty much almost the
same as the last check-in compared to
what we've all seen my forehead looked
like at some point with different
foundations this is pretty damn good
after over 10 hours I really like that
as a day has continued on I haven't
gotten any major major creasing on my
upper lip area around my nose even it
looked like it was gonna be a crease ER
but it hasn't gotten worse I don't think
this one has oxidized which is also a
plus maybe like 1/4 of a shade literally
just because I don't think my under eyes
weren't quite this light before compared
to the rest of my face but maybe so I
really like this one if you like matte
foundations this has such a beautiful
finish it feel like I'm looking just
blown out right now looks almost like
velvety matte yeah like a velvet matte
this thing looks like a velvet matte
finish I would say it's so smooth
looking which is especially rare like I
said with matte foundations I think I
would really like this with the Smashbox
primer water underneath or something
like that's a letter doubler nude mixed
in or even the CYO foundation i by the
way doesn't have a scent I didn't say
that earlier I didn't notice the scent
when I was applying it it's not
fragrance or anything so that is also a
plus I think it is a rare day and I
think we have a winner I like this one
I'm excited about it I'm excited to play
around with it so let me know down below
if you've tried this foundation and what
you think of it but if you guys enjoyed
