Friday this is where I do a new
foundation first impression every single
Friday on my channel this is actually
the last foundation Friday before the
big 15 days the foundation series which
is coming up and I'm announcing the
dates right now in this video those of
you who are newer burritos 15 days of
foundation is a series i do on my
channel every few months basically what
it sounds like
I test out a new foundation every single
day for 15 days you get 15 videos in a
row in the past I've worked with a
nonprofit called Project we'd be shared
for this series I'm going to leave the
announcement videos for the other 15
days foundation down below so you can
learn all about them and what they do
they do awesome work all the proceeds
from t-shirts and eBay sales and
different things that we did went to
them this time around this series is
actually just going to be the foundation
videos there's not going to be any kind
of merch or sales because projects we do
share and I are working on something
huge for the next one we started talking
about it and figuring things out a
couple months ago and it's going to
literally take the next six months for
us to plan this thing so that's what we
are working on that's why there's no
involvement with project we do share for
this series next one will be worth it I
think you guys will really like it I
didn't want to leave you guys hanging
without another series for six months so
that's why we're doing it now here we go
here are the dates that the next 15 days
of foundation series on my channel is
September 1st to the 15th getting 15
days in a row of videos prepared while
still putting up three videos a week in
the meantime is a ton of prep and work
from my time I've been trying to get to
three videos a week pre-recorded and I'm
actually going to start filming for 15
days of foundations like tomorrow I've
taken a bunch of your foundation
requests from Twitter from the comments
section from snapchat so make sure
you're following me on all of my social
media it will pop them in right here so
after the 15 days of foundation I always
do a wrap-up video which is basically
where I go through and rank the
foundations after trying them out again
so series ends on the 15th I'm actually
going out of the country a day after
that so I'm going to bring in the
foundations with me continue to test
them out against insert pre-recorded I
do have more than a week to try out the
foundations but I'm about 90% sure that
the wrap up video for this series where
I rank them all will be going up on
Monday September 25th that could change
I laughter you guys not the series if it
does I'm excited I know in the past you
guys have really enjoyed this series so
I
you're excited I hope you're looking
forward to it if you are make sure you
share on social with the hashtag 50 news
the foundation I screenshot your tweets
your snap your Instagram post with the
hashtag 15 days to foundation and
include them at the end of the videos so
if you want to be featured in a video
make sure you share on social pull on
sweating I feel like in Minnesota right
now I think that was all the 15 days of
foundation things I had to tell you guys
let's jump into this week's foundation
Friday so today is a little bit
different because I'm actually talking
about a powder foundation today so I was
in one of those powder foundation
YouTube Google searches where I was just
trying to find the best powder
foundations guys know I love the a
cosmetic celebration foundation
illumination it's definitely my favorite
powder foundation I love it for setting
my liquid foundation but I'm still in
the hunt for a good powder foundation
when I don't want to put on a full-on
liquid this powder foundation by
Clinique this is the Clinique beyond
perfecting powder foundation and
concealer two and one had really great
reviews it's supposed to be really good
coverage so I picked it up on Ulta this
product retails for $28 and you get 0.51
ounces of product they give you some
comparison in the it cosmetics one which
has eyelash glue on it classy get zero
point three ounces of product so quite a
bit less than this one and in the
maybelline better skin powder you get
0.32 so it seems like this does have
quite a bit of product which is great I
save this in every day in clinic video
they need to sort out their with
the shades I have a full review and a
bunch of videos using the clinic beyond
perfecting foundation and concealer this
is basically the liquid version of this
product not only does the shade range
suck I do have to mix the lightest shade
which is 0.5 breeze besides that their
shades are always out of order online
it's super bizarre it's hard to actually
figure out the lightest shades sometimes
and the same thing goes with this powder
I don't know why they make it twenty
times more difficult than it has to be
this is a shade 0.25 dune and when I saw
that this was a 0.25 I got super excited
because the lightest shade in this
foundation is 0.5 this shade Duden says
very fair with cool neutral undertones I
believe this is a new shade because I
don't see it listed on Clinique's
website even I don't know if the shade
is like exclusive to Ulta though an Ulta
website this comes in 13 shades with the
lightest shade being dooms if you go on
Clinique's website they have 16 shades
listed but they're totally different
they don't have the shade dune listed
and then there's this no named white
shade right here I would say just stick
to the numbers probably it's probably
the easiest way to go about it so as far
as I know I think 0.25 dune is the
lightest shade and it's on Alta so
there's only a couple claims on here it
says it's a powder foundation and
concealer and one for a natural beyond
perfected look that lasts all day even
through sweat and humidity which I will
definitely be testing out today
weightless powder makeup that covers
thoroughly without clogging pores skin
breathe comfortably color stays true
oil-free so that's all the claims
packaging is basically just click top
powder compact nothing super exciting I
usually do foundation swatches with
liquid synthesis powder I'm not going to
do that but I will show you try it side
by side it looks like next to the
cosmetics powder which is this one that
does anything for you if you want to see
what I think of the Clinique beyond
perfecting powder foundation and how to
apply somewheres throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching all right so I heard you guys I
moved the camera closer we are now more
zoomed in so hopefully you can see my
face a little bit better it's 9:15 right
now in the morning so far you wash
moisturize and prime my face I use my
high-low mine matte 12 primary just on
my t-zone so because this is a powder
foundation I'm going to test this out as
I would if I was wearing a powder
foundation personally which for me that
would be spot concealing underneath the
powder any time I used a cosmetics
celebration foundation illumination just
as a powder foundation
I definitely spot conceal underneath
because I have a lot of acne to cover up
I also have plans tonight so I need to
like actually do my makeup so the spot
conceal I'm going to use my Maybelline
instant age rewind concealer but this is
what I use when I don't wear foundation
if I just want to go out really quick if
I'm like running errands like look at
that it just blends into the skin I feel
like my spot concealing this is giving
the powder the best shot I'm just
putting this on any active acne I'm not
trying to cover up my redness or
anything so I do want to see how the
powder covers that this is just for my
acne you can still see my acne coming
through this isn't like full full
coverage so it's not a foundation you
typically do want to do any liquid
products first anytime you apply liquid
after a pouty after pouty after a powder
 can just get pretty funky so if I'm
going in with a powder foundation it's
definitely going to be the last step so
I'm gonna do my under eye concealer I'm
just going to focuses right underneath
my eyes I'm gonna try not to bring it
down super far or anything
this is BH Studio Pro concealer of raved
about we blend it out with my ma refugee
38 but this desperately needs to be wash
and wisdom
my concealer pretty straight view so I'm
just we use my finger today I was going
to set my under eyes like I always would
using my Physicians Formula powders have
a sunburn this peeling on my back so
itchy okay now I get to go in with this
guy I'm so excited
there's a little sponge and there's two
different sides whoa this is a cool
texture so one of the sides feels like a
normal foam sponge and the other one
feels like velvet literally it does use
the sponge side for moderate coverage or
the smooth velvety side for buildable
fuller coverage I'm definitely trying to
get the most coverage out of life so I'm
going to go on with this side I'm going
to try some part of my face typically I
don't like using sponges that come in
with powders but let's give it a go
try brush on the other side this is my
go to powder brush it's the fur last cb4
brush this is awesome it's super dense
and it's just great for getting good
coverage out of powders I'm going to
start out with one swipe that's so much
product we will do second one we do a
second swipe okay
I'm going to try and like Pat and
slightly me typically I don't get good
coverage swiping because I feel like it
just kind of wipes the product off I'm
not liking this applicator yes I'm going
to switch try the bottom of the sponges
when I wore few sponge I use this for
powder to set my face Elsie's is for
liquid foundation mmm I don't really
like that either with it doesn't seem to
really be applying well with that either
krytus brush I know with some powder
foundations you really have to like buff
them into your skin and almost gets
better coverage as you buff but I'm kind
of worried it's going to like blend off
some of the concealer the shade looks
pretty spot-on if you look at my neck
since I don't have pretty much any
concealer on my forehead I'm going to
try and really bust there and see if it
works brush is definitely a little bit
flimsier this is the morphe one brush so
I'm going to try this for my forehead
and fluff it in there
let's just definitely tone down my
redness even devout a little bit it does
not look totally full coverage on my
forehead you guys will see it's really
up close and natural lighting in a
minute emphasizing my texture but not
really like and how it's sitting on my
skin has this already oxidized
I feel like this just oxidized it's
supposed to be buildable and I'm not
getting that great of coverage on here
so I kind of still want to work on this
side maybe I'll try this morphe brush
down here
now that the concealer is kind of set
maybe one I feel like I've used a pretty
decent amount of powder at this point
and I think I'm getting medium coverage
keep in mind I have concealer underneath
this and even with concealer underneath
it still doesn't look like full coverage
or anything cuz there's a different way
should be applying this okay I'm going
to try using the elf ultimate blending
brush this is like a smaller brush but
it is pretty flimsy so this might give
good coverage but still blend I'm going
to first dab it on to see how it covers
we're consider motions okay that brush I
feel like applied at the best and also
looks the most natural it looks a lot
less kind of cakey on the side feel like
it's emphasizing my pores a bit I can
even see him on a viewfinder right now I
don't like how it looks on my forehead
at all and I just tried to go in and
smooth it out with this brush it looks
pretty heavy and the center of my
forehead looks really bad any place
where I have kind of texture or pores it
just does not look great when I go over
it it's almost like rubbing off and then
making the powder cling weird in certain
areas interesting ooh that looks that
looks bad I need to get close for this
one it's really hard for me to see what
you guys are seeing right now on the
viewfinder but hopefully you can see
this looking super weird and funky right
here took off all the product and then
there's like this line right now on my
skin I
not like in this at all looks pretty
heavy I don't think it's the amount that
I put on because this side of my face
I've did the same amount as this side I
just used a different brush yes I
definitely looks better than my forehead
and this side of my face but it still
doesn't look good
well this one is going to be fun to wear
tonight what you do for YouTube okay I'm
going to need to do some like bomb-ass
eye makeup or something right now to
compensate because my face looks like
 might be when those powders that
wears really well throughout the day and
kind of like warms up to my skin so
we'll see but off the bat this is not
something I would wear on its own I will
try setting my foundation with this and
see how it goes because a lot of powder
foundations I don't like on itself but I
like on top of liquid foundations to
give it a little bit more coverage and
set my makeup but we're going to call
the check-in time 9:40 since that's when
I clearly finished up my face makeup I'm
gonna do the rest of my makeup and I'll
be get right back and I'll show you guys
a shot in natural lighting so right now
it is 10:20 I'm going to cut to the clip
that natural lighting so you guys can
see what I think of it and then I'll
tell you what's everything what's
everything then I'll tell you everything
that's on my face okay so here's what
it's looking like in natural lighting
I'm going to zoom you guys in since I
sprayed Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray I do feel like it looks a lot
better
you can still majorly see my pores and
bumps and everything right here it looks
a lot heavier before I feel like but
here's the rest of my face as you can
see asking me and still definitely
coming through and my pores right now
look big look big around my nose it
doesn't look that good kind of like
caked up around here and I did feel like
my powder products actually it was kind
of tricky that totally blend them like I
feel like it looks pretty patchy and
that was after me full-on blending I do
like the shade I think the shade is like
a perfect match for me hoping it doesn't
oxidize more throughout the day alright
so for eyes I tried out the pure soirÃ©e
Schwarz wipes or one of those words that
use tech and guess yourself 50 times and
you just completely forget how to say it
Diaries palette again this is the second
time I'm using this I tried this out in
a video what video is it so the shadow
which means I haven't tried the shimmer
shades in here yet but the matte shades
are beautiful and you have like a nice
range of colors to work with blush I use
the BH floral blush in Bahama bronze
which is like this warm kind of peachy
bronze shade I tried this Pierre contour
Diaries and the shade secret again
and it's definitely not a contour shade
on my skintone but it's a nice bronzer
tone and then for a face highlight and
on the inner corner of my eyes they use
the cargo HD picture-perfect highlighter
and bronze just came in the fabfitfun
boss and this thing is gorgeous lips I
use Stila stay all day liquid lipstick
in caramel oh and I topped it off with a
little bit of this bite Beauty this in
the shade Blanc ish is a white lipstick
this is awesome for lightening any
lipstick dress necklaces always link
down below so the check-in time is 9:40
I'm actually going to be out I think the
rest of the day so the check and you
guys will see will be probably on the go
so I'll see you guys if you are alright
so snow 2:25 according to the oven my
phone is charging about to head out I
actually didn't leave the house yet so
it's been on for about five hours right
now I feel like it actually looks a bit
more flattering in this lighting right
now but when I've looked in the mirror
every time I'm definitely quite dewy I
don't mind this much to do is starting
to look a little bit oily on my forehead
and around my nose area I'll do you guys
in here is what it looks like I'm
getting a little bit of creasing on my
upper lip which is kind of odd for a
powder doesn't like how it's like
kicking up around here especially on
this side forehead I actually think
looks better than before like it's kind
of warmed up and gotten a little bit
dewy red my oil has come through right
now same thoughts as before I'll check
back in with you guys at the end of the
night it's now 8 o'clock so I just got
pins and needles in my foot it's been on
for a little over 10 hours it just got
back home I noticed I looked pretty oily
it's actually not looking super oily in
this lighting for some reason but I'm
definitely pretty shiny right now it
hasn't worn badly I definitely think it
looks better than when I first put it on
which is good because I think as my oils
have come through it just kind of looks
less cakey but with that being said it's
oxidized at least a shade it's too dark
for my neck now and I just don't love
the way that it looks at all my thoughts
pretty much haven't changed on this but
just so you can see after 10 hours
here's what it looks like it's breaking
down a tiny tiny bit on the center of my
forehead but also kind of just looked
like that earlier I feel like
not feeling this one I am going to try
it on top of a liquid foundation for
this video goes live and I'll update you
guys in the description box what it
looks like and what I think of it on top
of liquid foundation but I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you have any
powder foundations that you recommend
let me know what they are down below
I'll definitely try some out if you guys
enjoyed this video and are excited for
15 days Foundation don't forget to give
