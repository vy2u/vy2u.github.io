Friday this is where I try out a new
fret a new Friday can you tell I've only
had one cup of coffee I have a playlist
down below that has all of my foundation
Friday videos in it and if you're in LA
we have all the meet of details figured
out now for the meet up with myself from
project be sure so from 1 to 3 p.m. on
Saturday April 28th at the morphe store
in Brea mall that's when the meetups
gonna be so I can't wait to hug you guys
and hang out
so today foundation I actually picked up
when I was in Germany I'm pretty sure I
got this in the train station in Berlin
this is the vici dermablend fluid
corrective 16 hour foundation and I was
traveling I asked for you guys's product
recommendations and a bunch of you told
me to pick up this guy I'm a little bit
confused I'll get into it we're gonna
dive into all that but before we get
into the foundation I partnered with
glambot for this portion of the video to
let you guys know about their vault sale
that's currently going on from today xx
until the 25th of April they're doing
this huge vault sale get $10 off your
purchase of $20 or more so you're
getting 10 bucks off and you're
basically getting a $20 item for 10
bucks math if you use the coupon lush
Tayla which I'll pop in right here
that'll give you the $10 off I've
shopped on glambot for years I get a lot
of my high-end makeup on there because
it's marked down and the sales are the
time to shop because that's when you get
the best deals I recently got the lorac
Pro palette on there that I used during
15 days foundation a couple times got
that one on glambot I just always
checked their site and when a good sale
like this happens jump on it so I'll
leave a link down below but now on to
the foundation every time I say vici I
just think of a vici so here's the
situation with this foundation I posted
on Twitter because when I started
looking this up it looks to me like
there's two different versions of this
foundation one is the US version one is
the European version which isn't super
uncommon or anything for products but
the bottles look totally different
there's a white bottle and then there's
this black bottle as you guys on Twitter
to see if any of you new and it seems
like that's kind of the going theories
that is just different packaging so
hopefully it's not totally different
formulas but it was also really hard to
find like exact pricing and stuff for
this product so what i found is
depending on where you get it it's a
round 22 I would say is like the lowest
maybe 20 if you get it on like a sale
site or something 20 to about $35
depending on where you get it it comes
in one fluid ounce a product from what I
can tell based on online what I'm
finding in the u.s. it comes in five
shades that's what I'm finding on most
these sites I feel like when I was in
store in Germany they had more than five
shades so I'm not sure but I have the
shade of 15 Opel says it gives you a
full and immediate correction of skin
defects even the most severe I don't
know if you would want to call someone's
skin a defect but okay
there's no mask effect natural look
fluid an elastic texture that fits
perfectly to the skin it has SPF 35 in
it we are doing a flash test like usual
and it says this supposed to last up to
16 hours
it has glycerin in it to maintain skin
hydration for 24 hours that appeals to
me because I do have drier skin and it
says it's hypoallergenic if you're
ordering within the u.s. they have the
white bottle version on derm store and
on the germ store description it does
say it's supposed to cover blemishes
scars acne redness and has buildable
coverage on VG's website I only see the
white bottle version which is retailing
for $30 on their website and I only see
four shades so I think this one might be
totally different depending on what
country you're in and everything but
that's the situation with this one so we
will see I'm gonna do some swatches
right here so you guys since he had the
shade 15 opal which is the lightest
shade apparently compares to some of my
other foundation shades alright so here
are some swatches right here is the VG
foundation in the lightest shade 15 opal
next over is the dermablend smooth
liquid camo in the lightest shade linen
CYO lifeproof in 101 NARS ultra radiant
foundation in mont blanc derma called
2:08 milk makeup blur liquid in fair and
NARS sheer glow in Siberia I'm also a
bit confused by the dermablend situation
because they look like the exact same
logos and dermablend is on here so I'm
not sure if vici is the parent company
of dermablend and they're just more
popular overseas and then dermablend is
like the u.s. brand not finding any
information on VG's website about their
relationship to dermablend if there is
one so let us know down below if you
have any insight on that so if you're
excited for foundation
don't forget to give this video a thumbs
up if you're new here you can join the
bay radio family and subscribe upload
every Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. sip
time here we go
beachy dermablend ok so it's actually
our D 1134 right now I usually start my
check-ins like first thing in the
morning but we had a little bit of a DIY
foundation failed today I was planning
on filming a totally different video for
this week's foundation Friday I was
trying to DIY the cargo foundation in a
bag thing and I got like reusable baby
food packets of Amazon and it was just
it was not happening so here we are
let's give this a good shake so this is
actually the first foundation Friday
that I'm off accutane I just finished
yesterday in my time a few days before
you guys are seeing this video I'm
filming this on Monday but my skin is
still definitely more on the dry side
since I've only been off it for about a
day now I actually just got my blood
work done this morning I'm gonna be
having a full accutane video coming
talking about the experience and
everything already washed moisturized
and prepped my skin the products these
will be down below I feel like I have a
little bit of leftover mascara or
something cuz I did go to Cairo and the
blood thing this morning okay let's put
foundation on I can't been talking for
forever this is supposed to be really
full coverage I'm gonna start out with
the brush on this side of my face and
we'll do a sponge on the other side it
feels actually a lot thinner than I was
expecting it has an interesting scent to
it smells like carrots yeah
woah smells exactly like carrots when I
first put it on I thought the shade was
gonna be way too yellow but it's
actually it's blending in to be looks
like a pretty good shades about half a
shade too dark is quickly kind of
mattifying it looked a lot more satin
when it first went on and now it's
definitely mattifying a bitch I feel
like sometimes it's hard for you guys to
tell the coverage on camera I would say
this looks like full coverage but on the
spectrum of full coverage with a brush
it looks like lighter full coverage me
doesn't have as much coverage as
something like the huda beauty
foundation or the jus a high coverage
it's a little bit below that but it is
covering my scarring and stuff I can see
a little bit coming through but overall
I mean if you're just looking at my face
it does look like full coverage on this
side so let's do the forehead it feels
kind of like just a thin cream
foundation not looking good on my
forehead
bringing out my texture up here so maybe
this one is a sponge guy here's that one
side with a brush let's go in with a
sponge on this side and see how it does
you just squeeze somewhere out I feel
like I put out a pretty generous amount
like a quarter size and I'm already
through that oh that's looking nice with
a sponge actually is looking like about
the same coverage might be a tiny tiny
bit less with a sponge but the finish
looks a lot better with a sponge we'll
see how it dries down cuz this does seem
to mattify more as it dries this made
this over the rest of my forehead sponge
is making a world of a difference right
now that looks so much better smoothed
out with a sponge center of my forehead
does not look bad for more of a matte
foundation you don't have any more
product on my sponge right now I'm just
smoothing over the brush side shade is
dark like I think you guys can see on
camera you can see a little bit of a
line I think because the undertone is
okay it doesn't look to oranjee it
doesn't look that off but as far as like
an everyday shade I would probably mix
this with something this one mattifies
for sure as it sets down it's definitely
getting more and more matte this is
definitely a sponge foundation for me it
looks way less makeup II with a sponge
and I do love how my foreheads looking
right now I'm hoping this isn't gonna
crease or anything right now I'm liking
it I don't think it's the most full
coverage if you have acne
I don't think so would cover everything
because I still can see like scarring
and stuff coming through you might be
able to build this up or this might be
one that you have to spot conceal with
it looks like it's already starting to
crease a little bit on my upper lip
feels very lightweight I don't feel like
I have on like a thick mat full coverage
foundation and there's a tiny tiny bit
of tackiness but I do think I could
blend stuff on top of this which I like
if I don't have to set my face I don't
set it because of my dry skin I have a
tiny bit left on the palate so I might
just try and build this up on my
scarring just in this area I don't want
to bring it anywhere else
it's definitely building that just
covered my little scarring right there
that darkness coming through and it
doesn't look any heavier or cakey or
anything as I built that up so that's a
good sign so right now it's 11:49 I'm
gonna do the rest of my makeup and I'll
be right back
okay so it's now 12 whatever
12 come on phone Wow why we having
issues I dropped my phone in the toilet
in Nordstrom rack yesterday bleached the
crap out of this anyways it's now 12:20
we're gonna call the check-in time 12
o'clock I didn't actually have to powder
with anything which is yay yay for no
powder everything blended out totally
fine I felt like I was just blending on
top of a powder nothing dragged or
anything so I always love when a
foundation dries down to this kind of
finish because then you don't have to
like add another layer of product on top
the only thing I'm noticing right now is
that it has oxidized already it's
oxidized I would say about half a shade
since I last saw you guys it's actually
giving me like a little bit of a tan
look right now I went in with this
concealer today and this is how I know
this foundation is too dark because I
went in with this concealer and was
gonna layer a lighter one on top like I
usually do and this concealer actually
was light enough for my under eyes
because the rest of my face is too dark
right now I am already getting a bit of
creasing around my mouth and on my upper
lip so hopefully that doesn't get worse
throughout the day it does have a tiny
bit of Sheen to it it almost looks like
the finish of the NARS ultra radiant
foundation which I love
she looks pretty similar to that
foundation that one is still more
smoothing I would say and more full
coverage but just how it's sitting on my
skin right now it actually looks pretty
similar to that so far so good I'm
liking this one so I'm gonna start a
clip and natural lighting and we'll do
flash tests okay so here we are in
natural lighting I feel like it looks
better in natural lighting than it did
under the studio lights at least like
what I'm saying okay I think you can see
the shade a little bit better right here
what is that oh I have some scratch
marks I think from Snoopy and as I was
looking back on the swatches it even
looks a little bit darker than
dermablend smooth liquid camo and that
one I definitely have to mix so yeah I
think I would mix this one next time I
wear it but the finish and everything is
looking really nice I'm gonna zoom in so
you can see the little creasing I'm
talking about so it's just settling in a
little bit around my mouth super faint
lines starting on my upper lip but
here's my forehead not bad not bad okay
so let's go do a flash chest so this
does have SPF 35 in it and considering
that it's a little bit darker in real
life it does have bounce back but it
looks
nice and like smoothing the finish looks
really nice and flat so on the rest of
my face I really liked this bronzer
shade but it could just be because my
face is already a little dark but this
is the medium dark the radiant one by
CYO and first I just went in with this
middle shade because it looks like a
nice kind of cool toned bronzer shade
but I ended up swirling all of them and
even though it looks like there's
glitter a little bit in these two shades
when it's on the face I don't really
notice any glitter and it looks like a
really nice bronzy shade so liking this
for the shading my skin is right now I
actually tried this dollar blush that I
got off shop miss a I went in with this
shade right here and it looked a lot
pinkier and more pigmented on my face
and it did in the pan
this totally has that dollar blush smell
you know I'm talking about if you've
ever tried a blush from one of these
like off brands from Dollar Tree or
whatever it smells exactly like that I
actually have a lot of dollar makeup on
right now I also went in with the a/o a
highlighter halo highlighter this is in
the shade allure this is what I have on
my cheekbones and I also actually have
this on the inner corner of my eye and a
little bit on my eyelid as well for my
top eye shadows I used the Too Faced
natural eyes palette they have a matte
one and this one that has some like
shimmers and stuff in it but I like it
because they still give you a couple
mattes to work with so I have this shade
on silk Teddy is the shade that's all
over my lids and that shade is really
pretty and then for my waterline to get
that pink kind of on my waterline I used
heartless by Urban Decay and then to
make it look less like I had pink eye
because that pink was almost a little
bit too pink I thought it's gonna be a
little bit lighter I just went for a
full on purple lower lash line so I took
the BH Cosmetics festival palette and I
went in with wicked this black metallic
purple shade right there and then my
lips are also dollar where to go cannot
find the lipstick I used I'm gonna put
the correct shade down below in the
description box once I cleaned my desk
and this thing appears somehow I topped
it off with the CYO
lip gloss this is in the shade of your
best side and it's just like a light
pinky gloss so that's everything check
in is 12 o'clock I'm gonna be filming
this late tonight to get that 10 hours
in hopefully I'll see you guys in a few
hours and natural lighting okay so it's
5:19 so it's been on for a little over
five hours right now and I've been
looking at it throughout the day and
it's been looking really good there
some upper lip creasing it's not too bad
it's pretty faint but it is there it
took up my liquid lipstick but I have
creasing right there and right there but
my forehead I think looks really nice if
it actually has a little bit of glow
coming through I like the coverage
overall I like how this one is sitting
on my skin I like how we don't have any
scarring coming through and every time I
looked in the mirror today it did really
remind me of that NARS foundation so so
far I think this is looking really nice
and I'm kind of shocked for some reason
I would just thought this was gonna be
so happy and like matte and just not
good for dry skin but right now I mean
looking good looking good so we'll see
how the swears by the end of the night
shade us a little bit more accurate
right here I think you can see the
difference now maybe maybe not okay so
it's now 9:30 so it's been on for almost
ten hours nine and a half hours and
we're in different lighting again so it
looks good I mean same thing as before
just the upper lip creasing and I'm
getting a tiny tiny bit of creasing
right on the center but not too bad
overall I think it looks pretty nice and
just flattering for a matte foundation
on dry skin trying to get it so it's not
super bright there we go a little bit
right there on the center but for almost
ten hours not bad
I like how just lightweight it feels and
how it dried down to pretty much a
powder finish like touching my face it
doesn't feel sticky at all now feels
like a powder and it's actually not
transferring right now that's it no it's
not transferring ooh I like that so
overall I'm pleasantly surprised with
how this one wore on my skin I was
thinking about what I would mix this in
with just to smooth it a little bit and
lighten it and I think either would mix
this with CYO lifeproof and 101 or I'd
mix it with my lorac natural performance
foundation in lighter shade I think both
of those would be nice with this one if
the shade was alright I would wear it on
its own this one I cannot really tell
how this would do on more mature skin
because it didn't seem to settle into if
I do get creasing on my forehead it
didn't seem to crease up there so that's
a good sign I hope you guys enjoyed fun
day
