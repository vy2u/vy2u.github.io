all right so today we're gonna be doing
a full face on this look using all
drugstore makeup this is pretty much
half products that I used and love and
half new steps that I'm just like trying
out it is the morning after I got back
from London so I'm 99% jet-lagged right
now but makeup makeup fixes everything
pretty sure about eighty percent of my
favorite Holy Grail makeup is drugstore
makeup and I've done a couple of
drugstore makeup starter kit videos but
let me know if you guys would want to
see like a full face using my favorite
drugstore makeup or something along
those lines because I feel like I
mentioned them a ton in videos but just
to have one video talking about
everything might be nice I don't know
let me know if you want to see that down
below it's gonna be the same stuff I've
talked about fifty billion times but
there are lots of new baby dough's here
so my time if you enjoy this video while
you're watching you can give it a thumbs
up it helps me out I appreciate it and
let's jump into it if you want to see
how I got this full drugstore look
you're in the right place just keep
watching
so I've already primed my face using the
Revlon Photoready pore reducing primer
I'm still trying out foundations for the
wrap-up video for 15 is foundations so
I'm going to be mixing the Catrice HD
liquid coverage in the lightest shade
light beige which is too dark so I'm
gonna mix it with the la girl pro
coverage because this one is a bit
illuminating and it's obviously a white
foundation so it's gonna lighten it I
washed my hair I feel like every time I
wash my hair I have to tell you guys cuz
it's like big news I feel like my real
hair is finally like getting back to
being shiny and healthy only took like a
year definitely should have gotten
coffee what was I thinking all of the
stuff in be using today isn't really
classy cardboard box whoops that was
probably too much I have a whole video
comparing different white foundation
mixers so I'll put that in a little I
alright let's go in I think I'm gonna
use yeah let's try brush first this is
actually the Sigma f80 3 which is like
the weird curved one I use this in the
first impressions video that's are you
live and oddly enough I've been actually
really liking this this foundation is so
freaking mad I think it makes that a
little bit like I'm gonna add in a tiny
bit more of the drops because I didn't
mix out a little bit light I know this
mic battery is gonna die soon so I keep
checking it like every 10 seconds my
skin was breaking out so bad in London
of course of course I had a good like
week weekend half before and then as
soon as I got to London I got like the
most massive breakouts everywhere
kind of crazy because this stuff usually
like makes your skin friggin glow and my
face still looks very matte
so for under-eye concealer I want to try
out the L'Oreal infallible Pro glow I
haven't tried this out yet this is the
lightest shade and it looks hella dark
this is in the shade 0-1 classic ivory I
mean you can just see this compared to
my face this is pretty dark what I'm
gonna do to lighten is mix in some of
the NYX HD photogenic concealer in
lavender I'm using this for years to
lighten my concealer even though this is
lavender it's awesome for lightening
concealer I know that NYX makes a new
lightest shade in this concealer that's
actually super light I think but I don't
have that so I'm just gonna be using
this one I don't know how much coverage
this has or anything
woah this is making my eyes burn see if
it doesn't on this a it has a really
strong chemical scent I don't know if
that's what's making my eyes burn I'm
gonna try and put this on since it's
already on off the bat I don't think I'd
use this again because my eyes are like
burnin have you guys had that happen
with this concealer is it just me very
light coverage even with that NYX mixed
in okay I don't like how that looks at
all very sheer I'm gonna add in some of
the Maybelline fit me concealer this is
in the shade 15 because 15 is actually
lighter than 10 so if you've tried 10
and it was too dark try 15 I mean 15 I
still usually have to mix so I can
always lighten my under eyes with powder
afterwards this concealer is bomb by the
way I haven't used it in a long time but
it's always a good one definitely one of
my favorite drugstore concealers I just
need to come out with more shades I
always get questions about the
Physicians Formula setting powders I use
for my under eyes because it's kind of
tricky the shade and coloring and stuff
so the one that you want to use if
you're fair if you're like lighter than
I am this one I can totally use on its
own just depending on what foundation
I'm wearing and stuff but this one is
like the one you want to go to if you're
very fair this is the mineral we're
correcting powder in translucent shades
are all weird and it's really easy to
buy the wrong one but it's like this
correcting powder so there's different
colors I'm here and then just to darken
a little bit I'll tap a little bit of
the mineral face powder in translucent
light so that's what this one is
press it underneath you guys the elf
brush I used to always use I still use
this one I've just been really liking to
this by Smashbox it's there
full-coverage foundation brush but this
is the kind of brush I usually like for
my eyes because I feel like it gives the
most faultless finish for me it doesn't
like take away and have the coverage woo
maybe I need to go back to that
Maybelline concealer my under eye there
looking good right now I'm not gonna set
the rest of my face because this really
sets down what are we doing I'm gonna
prime the eyes using the Maybelline
instant age rewind concealer this is the
concealer I use on my like no makeup
makeup days just to cover my acne it
just blends into my skin so easily but I
also really like this as an eye primer I
feel like this is one of the best
drugstore eye primers even though it's
not technically an eye primer can use
the correcting one if you want or just
the shade this is in the shade fair so
for brows I want to try out this jcat
brow stylist set these are like the NYX
kind of squeeze tube brow products it
looks like there's brown and dark brown
in here and it comes with a brush this
reminds me of like Benefit packaging the
Jake out you can get on Aalto Ulta
carries most of their products now I
think some of the new releases it takes
a little bit longer to get this on my
hand it takes a little bit longer to get
it onto Ulta I'm going to squeeze a
little bit of this out on the pallet I'm
gonna try the brush just by the feel of
it I don't have high hopes but let's try
it it's a little bit hard with this
brush to get like a clean outer line
whoo I think I'm gonna switch my BH
brush feels super lightweight if that
makes sense like doesn't feel quite as
heavy as a gel product like the dip brow
or anything definitely got way too much
product out you need like the tiniest
amount I almost think the nozzle of this
it's a little bit hard to just get a
small amount out so that's the dark
brown color compared to the brown shade
so most of the face products I'm using
today are ones that I have used and I
love and then the eyes were trying out a
bunch of new stuff so for bronzer I'm
gonna use the elf Saint Lucia I love
this shade right here
whoops right here I'm gonna taking my
flower Beauty brush whoops just got way
too much you're like this is a really
nice bronzer tone where it's not too
warm or to oranjee something I've been
doing lately though is if you do have a
bronzer that you feel like looks too
warm take the same powder brush that you
use or sponge or something I'm just
gonna use how to brush if you used a
face powder you don't need to apply any
more but just take a little bit of a
powder foundation I'm just using that
darker Physicians Formula one and you
can pat it over and it kind of just
blends everything out and like
sit down there just neutralizes the turn
a little bit think about a little bit
more contour and definition for my
cheekbone so I'm gonna take the l'oreal
glam bronson 0/1 light pale I think this
was originally gonna be like a limited
edition and then I've seen it in stores
again so I don't know if they brought it
back but I've seen it lately so I
figured we'd use it in a video a little
bit of contour by the way if you do want
to set your face and you like a matte
finish I've been loving the Maybelline
fit me loose powder this is in shade 0-5
this looks awesome
over the milk makeup foundation I did a
whole video showing you guys how to use
this with the milk makeup blur liquid
foundation is the makeup for photos
video and this powder can just look for
again flawless o blush I almost forgot
okay let's go on with the Physicians
Formula butter blush in the shade rosy
pink I'm actually just gonna use that
same brush this is the Sigma F 15 it's a
really pretty like airbrush finish
I love the Physicians Formula butter
blushes the smell of them the finish the
way they blend out and just gonna blend
this is the furless cb4 brush one of my
all-time favorite highlighters I have a
whole video of my favorite highlighters
but this is definitely one of them this
is the elf illuminating palette this
shade right here I'm in love with now
that I'm looking at my face more I think
this eyebrow color is a little bit too
warm for what I usually like I do like
the formula but I think it might be a
little tiny bit too red I'm gonna go
with that lightest shade of this so
pretty this is one of those Tyler's that
always looks flattering
well highlighter mustache yeah so a lot
of how it looks on the tip of the nose
so I think I want to do like a shimmery
army green kind of eye because I have
some products here that I was too
watching last night and they looked
freakin unreal first off I have these
matte L'Oreal single shades which are
like perfect fall tones single
eyeshadows they never really reach for
or by because I feel like doesn't really
make sense price-wise to me when you can
just buy a palette and I also don't
really like having a bunch of single
eyeshadows laying around it's easier to
just have everything in a palette but I
was watching these and I don't know if
this is a new formula or what these are
the L'Oreal matte color riche eyeshadows
and they are so soft so buttery
try these if you are gonna be buying any
kind of drugstore makeup in general but
especially something like this I would
definitely wait until L'Oreal goes on
sale the drugstore rotates around the
brands they put on sale so I rarely buy
anything at the drugstore full price if
you're gonna be buying something just
wait till it goes on sale
lore'l a lot of times does buy one get
one half off Rite Aid sometimes does
like 40% off L'Oreal but I'm gonna start
out this shade 3:02 matte astrayed looks
pretty close to my skin tone I'm like
half out of my travel makeup bag right
now and then half of my brushes are
somewhere else
I'm gonna try this one if this is too
light as the transition shade which I
kind of have a feeling it might be I'm
just gonna use the same contour shade
yeah it is skip that one I'm gonna take
the same contour shade we used and just
put that in the crease now I'm gonna
take the shade which I am so excited
about oh my god okay this is the shade
3:04 this is like this rich camel Brown
kind of shade I'm gonna pop this into
the crease a bit by the way I tried to
get these off my hand last night after I
was watching them even with my oil-based
makeup remover I had a hard time getting
these off so I feel like these would
probably last really well throughout the
day now that I'm back from the trip and
I'm like back into filming everyday
ready for these lash extensions to be
off just so I can wear falsies again
when you do a full-on makeup look false
lashes just add a little
something-something oh my god all of
these shades are just like fall in full
force this is the shade 3:06
it's showing up way more red on camera
yeah I looked straight at Brett on
camera but in real life it's like the
exact same color as my shirt almost oh
my god these are blending out
beautifully I'm going to take the shade
3:08 the super rich Brown I'm just
popping this into kind of the outer V in
the crease a little bit
it's deepen it up and I'm gonna be
putting that green shade on the lid what
you guys don't see is 20 minutes of
frigging blending so this thing is what
I'm so excited to try this is by JK it's
a new prism it'll Chrome I moose this
one is in the shade Houdini this is a
really weird formula it's like a cream
super bouncy
I'm just gonna tap this on my lid some
of the shades of these i swatched were
more sheer okay it definitely applies
better with your finger I mean it's
super pretty very reflective
I don't like it quite as much as the
makeup revolution ones I think it could
be a little bit more opaque like
building this up quite a bit when I
blend the 304 shade down on the lower
lash line and I'm gonna do a winged
liner today but I think I want to do
brown I feel like that'll look nice
lately I've been really liking using the
morphe 43 brush it's just like a flat
edge liner brush and going in with a
dark brown so I'm gonna go back in with
3:06 push this right up next to my lash
line this makes your eyes pop a bit more
so also by jcat they came out with these
holographic 3d Stoppers this isn't the
shades so poppy and it's like this
reddish kind of copper color I just have
to swatch this for you look at that
shine so I think I might actually use
that same brush and dip into this on the
back oh that dried really fast right
below that other shade for the inner
corner let's just stick with the J
cat-themed I'm gonna use this triple
crown baked eyeshadow these are so
pretty I might mix these two kind of oh
my god so pretty I kind of want to try
cleaning up that line with powder seen a
few people doing that and I'm just
curious I'm gonna take this elf brush
cuz it's the closest thing to like a
flat edged brush I can find right now
and I'm actually gonna use the loose
Maybelline fit me powder I mentioned
this is supposed to be like kind of an
alternative to taping off your lids you
know your eyes just to clean out the
line I'm gonna just keep that on for a
second while I do the other one this
brush is curved so not the easiest I
think a straight edge brush would be
easier I'm basically just taking it a
little bit out from my outer corner
because I don't want to make it look
smaller okay now I'm gonna brush it away
Oh
ooh I like that it looks a lot softer
than using tape I generally like doing
my eye shadow after foundation just what
I like to do I almost want to
a little bit of this as a face
highlighter let's do it I think I'm just
gonna mix the two lighter shades right
here it's definitely there now I want to
try out this L'Oreal super slim liner is
a brown liner in the shade Brown I like
that this is more of like a deep brown
do I want to wing this I might just
actually kind of smudge it out on the
end just gonna put a tiny bit on the
morphe b19 it's like I'm just gonna put
it right on here it's going with some
lower lashline mascara my favorite is
wet and wild make a length it doesn't
transfer down to my concealer has a nice
one for the lower lashes I'm using it
for years
so for lips L'Oreal came out these new I
think these are new infallible Pro matte
liquid lipsticks have not tried these
yet and the shades look is so nice and
so full so I want to use one of these
they look kind of somewhere in the tube
3:58 cowboy and then the darker one is
352 shakedown I might actually do
shakedown and cowboy I hope these dried
down dried down
I feel really soft and buttery like the
L'Oreal lip gloss I love the wand is a
little bit hard for a liquid lipstick
it's just a little bit flimsy he doesn't
let's take a while to dry down because
this is not mad at all let's try cowboy
oh yeah that's the color and going for
so when you first put these on they feel
super moisturizing and quite sticky so
I'm gonna see how long this takes to dry
down but does say they are Pro matte so
it has now been 15 minutes
I took some Instagram photos and even
after 15 minutes you can see it's still
not totally matte and it's also very
sticky I like my liquid lipsticks to dry
down so I don't have to worry about them
I don't think about them this has been
transferring to my teeth this whole time
and I can also just feel it like my lips
feel like they're kind of like sticking
together but this is the final look I'm
gonna have everything I used link down
below in the description box along with
my necklaces t-shirt nail polish
everything is always down below in the
description box I think out of
everything I'm most into the matte
eyeshadows obviously the face stuff I
used I love and I've used before this I
don't know I kind of mixed feelings on
this I don't think it's like the best
formula
worked and I don't think it looks bad
you're just gonna have to work with it a
little bit so hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you did make sure you give it a
thumbs up the London vlog is gonna be
coming actually when this video goes up
I think you guys will be having it as a
bonus video this week drop a video for
15 days foundation will be coming this
