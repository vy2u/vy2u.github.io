wild rager over here
all right so today we're doing a full
face of first impressions using all
makeup from Daiso I was walking around a
random neighborhood in Seattle and
literally just stumbled upon a Daiso
store die so if you haven't heard of it
is a Japanese store in Japan it's a
hundred yen store in the u.s. everything
is pretty much a dollar fifty they have
literally everything you could ever want
in life I've never actually been inside
a huge store like this one I've been in
the one in downtown Seattle which is
puny compared to this thing let me tell
you I could be in that store for five
hours it was literally like heaven so
all of the makeup products I'm wearing
in this video were a dollar fifty I used
12 products so I did my entire face and
makeup right now for 18 bucks that'd be
fun to try out so this makeup for the
first time I do have a couple other
videos similar to this I did a Dollar
Tree makeup challenge as well as a $13
full face video where I used all
products from shop miss a just wanna see
either of those videos I'll link them
down below
if you're excited for this video make
sure you give it a thumbs up if you want
to see how I got this look and when I
think of the products you're in the
right place just keep watching I'm so
excited right now
we're going to do this so one of the
only foundations I could find that I
think may match me we have like a 42%
chance that this will match is the santi
aqua stylish silky milk foundation and
this does have SPF 20 in it and that's
pretty much we've got no details so
we're just going in blind here Sanchi is
one of the popular brands on shop miss a
also clean color so a couple of the
makeup brands that we're at Daiso aren't
Japanese so I tried to pick majority
Japanese products because I feel like
that's what's most interesting and I've
never tried but squeezing out on the
palette color looks like it might be
good I'm going to start with a brush
that's usually what I get most coverage
with and my plan when I was washing off
my face tonight was two spot conceal
first and then I realized I couldn't
find a concealer there so I remember
they had stick concealers but pretty
sure was a clean color one and I think
I've tried that this feels very gel like
definitely has a kind of grandmas done
to it but it feels very moisturizing
yeah it looks like it looks really nice
it looks like skin pretty light covered
you can see my acne and stuff coming
through let's try it with a Beauty
Blender on the other side this is a damp
Beauty Blender I always get questions I
always use my makeup sponges dry
dry damp my acne is just going to be out
party tonight because we don't have
concealer but at least someone's
partying tonight I think it looks pretty
much the same with both the
Beautyblender and a sponge street is
good it looks really nice on my forehead
it doesn't look foundation II at all
almost looks like a tinted moisturizer
I'm going to attempt to build this up
yeah I actually think I like it better
with a B blender this is building now
I'm kind of wishing that I filmed this
in the morning because kind of curious
how this holds up when I'm filming this
I filmed a $64 foundation video
yesterday and to be honest like in this
one a little bit better right now just
goes to show you that a good product is
a good product no matter what the price
tag I'm not saying this is a good
product because I haven't worn it
throughout the day yet but off of first
impressions I do really like the way
this is looking
and it's a freaking dollar 50 it
definitely is oxidizing a bit attempt to
spot conceal a little bit with the same
foundation just concentrate it rock to a
good start folks so since I don't have
concealer like it said ten times now I'm
also going to put this under my eyes and
hope that it doesn't majorly crease but
again just kind of concentrating it to
brighten up that area good thought I
forgot brow products for a second so a
contour slash bronzer with something
that was a little bit tricky to find so
I ended up getting this stick foundation
this is by clean color this is their
skin deep foundation and this is in the
shade 580 dark beige I was kind of
debating between a few shades but I
think hopefully this one should work and
I'm just going to use this stick
foundation as a cream contour should
probably get a brush out that would be
great I usually use this sort foundation
but whatever really got a blend that
this isn't blending the easiest and I
feel like it's taking away some of the
coverage I got so I'll probably go back
in a bit warm to be a contour color but
I mean it works to kind of serve as a
bronzer what is next let's do a row I
actually got a face powder I don't know
if I want to use this because I actually
really like the way my skin looks right
now sometimes it takes away some of the
coverage but this is the powder
foundation I'll show you guys anyways I
got the shade light beige I might try
and just put it on a little bit down
here to see
you how it looks for I go all in with my
full face Thanks
packaging is intense so here's the
compact you do stick it in yourself it
has a little sticky thing that you peel
off on the back so it's not magnetic you
actually stick it there we go it's a
little bit chalky where are all my
brushes right now
so as a test run I'm going to use this
to kind of clean up down here oh man I
think I'm actually going to go
powderless just even out this side
let's do brows so I got one brow product
right here this is the eyebrow pencil
they don't have very original names in
this Jade dark brown I feel like oh
C's did I take a picture of this how do
you do that right now for Instagram all
right we're set back to this guy there
were a couple of different eyebrow
pencils I chose this one because it
actually looks like it has the same kind
of tip as the anastacio one where it's
like a wide kind of Engl whatever
translates like a little triangle angle
there we go so you get a spoolie hell
yeah
come through these guys so it looks like
it has a nice little angle to it ooh get
the ends I'm kind of turning it to use
the really fun point this I like I like
a little bit of stiffness to my eyebrow
product so it's not just lighting on and
you don't get too much color at one time
you can kind of work with it not the
best shapes I've ever done but still
good oh I remember what I was going for
okay so I got this this is the Santee
big smoky eyes shimmer eyeshadow stick
actually I kind of want to finish off
the face first so I got to blush options
I think my rationale was this was that I
could use this as a blush but I could
also try and use this as an under eye
setting powder because it doesn't really
look like it's a highlight it says it's
the highlight might be windows that
looks more matte in the pan but actually
is a highlight so maybe I'll test it on
my cheekbones and see what we get and
then maybe set my under eyes with it and
it might help to kind of brighten
everything up then I also got this blush
which is in the shade Orange I just want
to see that's kind of a pretty very
natural glow I think I can maybe bring
this under my eyes I'm just going to do
that because it's not super intense and
I think it might help to brighten things
up
it it almost reminds me of the hourglass
ambient lighting powder bring this on my
Cupid's bow and my nose is pretty glowy
so maybe I'll just put tiny bit this
isn't an intense like holy pop kind
of highlight is more of just a subtle
glow which is what I actually prefer
lately at least just to switch it up I
might try this orange II blush my other
thought process with getting the orange
blush was that I can use this at the
crease color as well no idea how
pigmented this is this is not blending
out the easiest but that could also be
because I don't have a powder on right
now I add in a bit more highlight in a
second
but let's move on to eyes so I got this
thinking that I could use it as a base
and we're going to attempt to do like a
smokey eye this could go really well or
really not well so this is the Santee
big smoky eyes shimmer eyeshadow stick
this is just black packaging of this
reminds me a lot of the NYX jumbo eye
pencil I'm going those were all the rage
doesn't fill me so much lately that my
room right now literally looks like a
tornado everywhere except what you guys
are seeing so it feel like half the
brushes are like under clothes and
things right now I may regret this
decision we will soon find out is there
glitter in here no there is gesso slices
shimmer
this is all going to be more blended
once I put stuff on top of it my main in
my main I mean my only eyeshadows that I
bought is this little quad Elif our
princess chiffon eyeshadow so there's a
shimmery white shade in here which I
also debated using as a highlight but
not them looking at this this is a
little bit glittery it looks like I'm
not going to start out by taking that
peach blush and to blend this into the
crease and go back in with that black
I'm just kind of diffusing that black
shade and pushing it right into the
crease where did that come from I think
with my finger I'm going to take this
shade right here
and just press that onto ooh that's
pretty
press it onto the lid and this feels
nice and soft then just to fully blend
that into the crease I'm going to take a
blender brush and Bowl plunge it into
the crease right on the inner corner I'm
going to try and pop some of this copper
actually might spray this with a setting
spray too
it really pops isn't technically
cheating because you can do this with
water today I'm just going to kind of
fade that into that gray okay this one
got way more puffs whoa I'm gonna do the
same thing on the other side not sure
what I want to do with the lower
lashline yet so I think I'm going to go
on to winged liner if I'm scared for
just as liquid liner there were a few
different liner options but this one had
a picture of the brush on here which is
I got it it looks like it has a fine
point right there oh this is Elif rlf
air eye so this water-resistant looks
like it's a felt tip applicator we're
going to have to have a moment of
silence again while I do this wing so
far it's going on very black here's the
true test from one try and do a wing
okay yeah let's do the end it does have
a fine point it feels like it's drying
down you know and you can feel your
eyeliner drying sometimes it feels
almost like it's tightening so I'm
liking this better than about eight out
of ten eyeliners that I try I would use
that one again what do I want to do on
the lower lash line that is the real
question I'm debating going in with this
guy on the waterline and then doing like
a super smoky eye you might want to
smoke out the bottom yeah I'm going to
time to use this on the waterline and
make a really great phase while doing it
I shadow snake blends out really easily
tied together the lower lash line I'm
going to go back in with the orange
blush shade maybe we'll just do a pop of
shimmer of that gray and spray it on
back in with this for the face you know
this looks a little bit like looks like
the Lancome LaRose the limited edition
rose it almost has this same kind of
look to it
which I actually did a video on on
Monday so by the time this video goes up
that video will be live I'm gonna put it
in the little eye over here I'm gonna do
a thin coat of mascara does it say hi
curling volume ups mascara and I have
false lashes I'm going to be putting on
two for being a curling mascara this one
is not curved at all this one isn't
doing a whole lot for me coating my
lashes
but I feel like that's about it it's not
really adding a whole lot of length or
volume these are the impact lashes in
number zero three I really like these
kind of dull separated lashes all right
so the false lashes are on and I'm
liking them probably not with this look
I have the really separated look which
I'm a fan of so they actually didn't
have a whole lot of lipstick options so
I just went with a clean color one kind
of a nude and then also a gloss this is
in the shade cocoa melt 728 and I didn't
get a lip liner so I'm going to put this
on smells exactly like crayons whoa
this is bring them back kindergarten buy
this feels very moisturizing I can't get
down with this scent but the formula is
nice I'm going to try this lip gloss out
it smells almost good smells like
sunscreen maybe I'll try and put some of
this pan eye shadow shade on to lighten
it up right here oh I totally could have
done a foundation kind of led to it just
got in with the gloss definitely more of
a metallic lip now but feeling it I
think that's everything
is that everything concluding sauce I
think Dollar Tree needs to step up their
game I might as well show you guys a few
other things that I picked up there
because this thing is person crazy this
is a Frizzle to genius because this is
my issue a sheet mask this is a sheet
mask holder you literally stretch this
thing around your face put it behind
your ears and it holds on your sheet
mask like I might actually be into sheet
masks now I also got more lashes then I
got blotting papers because I actually
have never used blotting papers I've
used like my friends a couple times but
I've never actually purchased blotting
papers even though I get oily I don't
know why but I just feel like one
actually use them but I'm going to try
it out maybe for my foundation videos
we'll try at the end of the night to
blot and see how it works get 250 sheets
in here which i thought was a really
good deal so that is everything I hope
