all right so today I'm gonna be doing a
full face of makeup trying out two
different brush sets from romwe if
you're never heard of runway it's
basically like da full she and those
cheap Facebook ad kind of sites I
recently actually did a huge runway
clothing haul and when I purchased those
clothes I also got these brushes to try
out trying to pull up my info here while
still holding these brushes so this
first blue set retails for four dollars
and ninety nine per brush you get ten
brushes in here so that is about 42
cents per makeup brush this rose gold
set retails for 399 and you get twelve
brushes in here so each brush is about
33 cents four dollars for that amount of
brushes is a pretty damn good deal but
we're gonna see if it's actually worth
it this is like the price of half a
Chipotle burrito bowl so don't want you
to be wasting your $4 I also have a
video testing out to different Amazon
brush sets and some of the brushes that
I found in that video I still use to
this day every single day so I'm gonna
link that video down below as well but
if you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the burrito family
and subscribe I upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time and
you're actually coming at a great time
here because 15 days of foundation is
starting March 15th I just posted the
announcement video on March 1st talking
about the campaign project Beauty share
that shelters involved what we're
raising money for and how you guys can
get involved so I'm gonna link that
video down below but don't forget the
limited edition 15 days of foundation
t-shirts are for sale
right now all right here we go if you
want to see how I got this look and what
I think of these $4 brushes you're in
the right place just keep watching it is
so freaking toasty in here I know he's
like an ice pack so I've got my two
brush sets here the blue one and then
this kind of rose gold one I'm just
gonna take the five thousand pieces of
plastic off just so you guys don't hear
it let's first go through this blue set
this is one where you get ten brushes it
looks like there's about five face
brushes and then they give you five kind
of smaller eye brushes or highlight
whatever we end up using them for the
face brushes are pretty small if you
look at this kind of flat kabuki
compared to the Sigma f80 you can see
how much smaller this one is the handle
length on these is very small they're
kind of like mini brushes which could be
nice to travel with same on the other
set to the handles are pretty short and
then you get these five smaller brushes
rose-gold set you get 12 brushes I
wanted to get this one because it looks
like there was a good kind of assortment
for eye brushes and a couple of them I
think we can use in different ways as
far as just holding these two in my hand
this one definitely has a little bit
more weight to it feels a little bit
more sturdy these feel pretty plasticky
and cheap we're gonna do a full face
test in these two brush sets out I'm
gonna try and use every brush or most
brushes in some way I did already wash
mooster eyes and perhaps my skin just
use the hang over a three and one I'm
out of this thing I'm gonna give this
foundation a shake I want to try this
again this is the Revlon Colorstay
normal to dry in the shade 130 porcelain
I did a video comparing the new formula
which is this against the old formula of
Revlon but I haven't used this again
since my skin has changed with being on
a keychain so I want to try this one so
out of the face brushes I have here
there are three that I think I would
probably lean towards for foundation
these are smaller than the average like
kabuki face brush this flat top one
actually feels very flimsy like super
flimsy I would not apply foundation with
this this one that slanted feels a
little bit better this one definitely
feels the most firm but it's also really
small so I feel like it'd be hard to
kind of blend that in quickly I started
out with the firm 1 and then might blend
it out with this angled one so I find
that with brushes I just go ton of
product what was I gonna say just
totally lost my train thought this feels
very small on my face it's definitely
streaking quite a bit I'm gonna try and
kind of stipple it in oh I was gonna say
with brush sets that I've tried I feel
like a good foundation brush is one of
the things that they're always lacking
that's one of the things in my opinion
that usually it's worth it to purchase
an individual foundation brush I can
blend out my foundation with this is
just taking about 10 times longer than
it normally would and I haven't even
done half my face yet this foundation
isn't sitting the best on my forehead I
keep these earrings in check I think
that just took me about 5 minutes to
blend out half my face ok so let's try
this angled one now oh oh I do not like
this one no no no this one is already
giving much lighter coverage it's just
way too flimsy both of them feel soft
though so that's good they don't have
like scratchy bristles I'm gonna go back
in with this domed one typically I use
the morphe G 38
to blend out my under-eye concealer and
to get around my nose per se and also
just kind of get like in the crevice of
my nose so the most comparable one in
this set is this pointed one it's
definitely bigger and is more pointed
and it also feels quite a bit flimsier
do you see how much these bristles Bend
when I push them versus this one I'm
just gonna try and clean up around here
that one is almost rubbing the
foundation off so don't like that one at
all that's completely rubbing the
foundation off I have a ton of
brushstrokes on my face right now and it
just doesn't look blended let's move on
to under-eye concealer this one I can
tell would be a disaster I might try
this other that could work let's try
this one this is like an angled one
let's get some shape tape action going
here definitely lighter coverage than I
would normally get with the brush that I
use or with my finger like I can still
see some darkness coming through right
on the inner corner but as far as the
finish and how it blended out it looks
nice and smooth and it almost sheared
out the shape tape but in a good way or
it doesn't look too heavy under there
that looks pretty good if I just want
more of like a sheer natural-looking
concealer doesn't look natural at all
but like the finish I would use that one
again if I'm going for not a super full
coverage under I just maybe a little bit
of brightness so my under eyes are weird
the best way that I find to set my
concealer with powder is by using a firm
brush like this almost like a foundation
brush this is technically a foundation
brush I also use an elf one that's like
rounded and kind of firm I feel like
that gives me the best look and under I
for whatever reason I can't use like the
little flimsy fluffy brush and like some
translucent powder
it makes my under eyes ik horrible so a
brush like this works best for me and I
usually just kind of DAB it and then
smooth it over the top too so the
closest one to this and firmness
definitely the closest one is the
foundation brush this isn't No
how do I describe this you know those
brushes that are just they feel almost
like plasticy or something it just feels
really cheap I think we're kind of out
of options anyway so let's just go in
with this one for powder not loving that
that just basically took away any of the
coverage I had going on under there that
one for what I like I definitely
wouldn't use again for under-eye powder
so typically I apply my powder just
right here so that's what I'm going to
do I don't have a big
powder brush all my normal brushes I'll
have link down below so you can see
which ones exactly I normally use
let's just try that same one actually
that I just used for my undereyes so I'm
just gonna use that same Physicians
Formula der I'm just putting this right
where I'm gonna be blending blush
bronzer and highlight I'm actually gonna
put a little bit of that on the center
of my forehead too just because it is
not looking good
that Revlon Colorstay definitely is not
for my skin right now I'm gonna use some
mac fix+ right now because we need some
moisture there we go
looking a little more alive wow look how
much that transforms your skin so well
that's drying let's use this eyebrow
brush I'm excited they put an eyebrow
brush in here I'm just gonna first pull
these out Oh is there spoolie another
giant spoolie
it's got excited for a second then I'm
gonna use this brow pomade bifocal or
and the shade zero for Ash Brown I tried
this in the whish makeup video I got
this for like a dollar two on wish and
I've used it a few times since that
video and I still I'm still liking it I
have a few different brow brushes I use
but both of these are definitely more
stiff than this romwe one it feels nice
and soft and that one works that totally
works
if there were multiple options in front
of me and I could choose whichever brush
I probably wouldn't go for this one I
would go for something a little bit
firmer but it does the job man that
fixed plus literally just saved the day
as use my makeup forever brow liner to
draw in some lines and give it some
dimension usually with my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot I'll just use my fingers or
I'll use the Kat Von D number forty
brush just so you have to like dig your
nails in there and then you can just
apply it this brush out of the rose gold
set feels pretty stiff like it's not
something I would want to apply
eyeshadow with so I think for primer
this might work well I'm just gonna give
it a swirl in there this one almost
feels like you could blend out concealer
with two it's definitely pretty small
but it has that firmness to it for eye
primer that works great does the job so
before I go in for eyeshadow let's do
some quick blush bronzer highlight I'm
using my Physicians Formula bronzer
butter bronzer because this is pretty
much impossible to not blend out if we
can't blend this thing out we can't
blend anything out I'm gonna use that
same one that I used to set my under
eyes and face not the illness for
bronzer
I'm gonna go back in with that
Physicians Formula powder to blend it
out and tone it down just grab in powder
and blend in it right on top that
rescued it oh Wow good job do you a
stay for one piece
I want a little peachy cheek so I'm
going to take the adore blush duo let's
try the flimsier one for this this is
the really flimsy flat top I'm just
gonna actually mix these two shades a
little bit blushes are so pretty okay
that works again to blend that out a
little bit more I'm gonna go and with
that same powder again go right over top
just don't use those edges out oh that's
a good word fuse let's go in for a
little highlight looking at the options
in the blue set this one looks angled
quite flimsy that one might be good this
one's a flat top yeah so I'm gonna take
the biggest angled one for a face
highlight this smack highlight palette
will give you like the strobe highlight
kind of look I'm gonna take the lightest
shade in this palette check that out
it's not even totally showing up on
camera I feel like it looks ten times
better in real life but you get that
like metallic metallic intense highlight
look dude look at that thing I hope you
guys can see this it is one of those
highlighters that's gonna emphasize your
texture a little bit if you have any
right there which I do I have a whole
video on highlighters that don't
emphasize your texture and I actually
have like a handful of new ones that I
would add to that video maybe I'll do an
update to one of those but if you have
issues with your highlight really
emphasizing that area on your face then
watch that video I'll link it down below
that one's nice for highlight one of my
all-time favorite most used palettes is
the Jaclyn hill morphe palette it's a
great frigging eyeshadow palette and
ever I do will look with this I just
like how my eye shadow turns out I feel
like it's pretty hard to mess up so I
feel like this will be a good palette to
test out new brushes with mine is a
little bit messy right now it took it
traveling and one of the shades kind of
broke this deep green so here's kind of
our options as far as crease blending
brushes which one do I want to go with
there's not like a big fluffy kind of
brush which I normally start out with
this one might be the closest oh I don't
like this has that plastic you feel
again with the bristles what I was
talking about with this thing where it
just feels like powder flies up okay
let's start out with this flimsy one for
the crease if I lift up this palette
every time the green eyeshadow is gonna
fall over but I'm going up with the
third over shade that tan shade third
from the left
whenever I use this palette this is
usually with the shade that I started
out with Mac Paint Pot is definitely
hands down my favorite base to use this
palette with / any eyeshadow palettes
with but especially this one I've tried
different bases with it and the Mac one
definitely is magical with that these
handles are very small like my hand is
at the very end of here which again I
would totally don't mind for traveling
and stuff but just does your everyday
brushes might get some hand cramps going
it has way longer and flimsier bristles
that I like this is the brush I would
usually usually use for this and you can
just see the difference so now I want
something a little bit firmer so I can
kind of build some Brown to the crease
these white ones I'm not digging the way
these feel this would be good like cut
crease one super pointy and stiff this
one has a little bit of an angle to it a
little bit of a dome I'm going to take
the shader right below the one I just
use so three over one down feel like I'm
playing a what's that game battleship
well I went through a major battleship
phase as a kid I'm gonna put this into
the crease I love this shade I'm gonna
go back in with the blending brush and
blend out those edges this one is just
so frickin flimsy tazza legitimate use a
shimmery white light champagne color
usually for my lid shade I'll use a
brush like this to kind of place it
exactly where I want it but then to
really get the pigment in the pop I'll
go in for my finger and just put it
right on top
Aurel wet the brush and go back in with
it this feels like a nice even like
concealer brush where you could clean up
your brows or as an all-over lid shade
there's also this one which is a little
bit bigger
I'm not feeling these white bristles at
all I'm gonna go with that first shade
in the palette there's something about
this rose gold set that just feels so so
so not cheap it just doesn't feel good
to use they're like 30 cent brushes so
I'm not expecting them to feel like
stigma or anything but it just doesn't
feel the best going on just for the sake
of really trying these brushes instead
of using my finger right now I'm gonna
go in and wet the brush with that same
shade so I'm just using mac fix+ again
and I have the coconut shade and it
literally smells shade scent and it
literally smells like heaven
second I'm gonna go in with this
blending brush now that we haven't used
yet I'm gonna use six over and three
down I'm just kind of placing that in my
outer B and then blending
into that white alright I like that
brush I'm gonna go back in with the
shadow brush and just clean up the line
right at the front here there's not a
total flat edge brush in the set but
there's an angled brush like this that
I'm going to use for the lower lash line
so I'm gonna go in with my favorite
brown shade in this palette well I have
to live like in but my two top top dark
Browns are both on the bottom row six
over bottom row and then one up from
that this is a little bit thicker than I
like for the lower lash line I do not
like this brush look at how thick that
line just got okay I'm gonna try and
blend this out there is this little
brush but it's super firm but let's try
it no way Jose I'm gonna go with that
shade that we started with the light tan
and blend that out trying to diffuse
this but this brush is so stiff but it's
the only small enough one just because I
haven't used this one yet and I kind of
want to I'm gonna blend out the lower
lash line with this and just see if it
does anything to help out that situation
there's no product on this brush right
now I'm gonna use this one for my inner
corner so now I'm going in with the
second over lightest shade which is also
a beautiful face highlight and I might
wet my brush with this one again we'll
see I usually use my finger for this
because you get a major pop with this
shade with your finger there we go I'm
also gonna put just a dab of that first
shade with my finger and I'm gonna blend
those together again I'm gonna add a
little bit more dimension into the
crease with a darker shade I'm use this
brush to place it because I do want it
right above that white and then I'm
gonna blend it out with a different one
but now I'm gonna go in with let's do
the brown right above the black I'm just
gonna place it on there and then blend
it out afterwards I'm gonna go with the
same one I used to blend to blend out
those edges I want to add a little bit
of a darker Brown right to the end used
every brush I think almost besides this
one which is another like shadow one
shadow packer and then this one so I
think I'm gonna pack on the brown with
this brush and then blend it out with
this one just so we can use both or
attempt to bottom row the brown next to
the green
oh this might be hard this is a lot
bigger than I thought never mind
we're not gonna do that with this brush
I think that eye primer brush would have
been good for this actually well I guess
I'm gonna pack it on with that same
shadow brush just cleaned out this brush
let's go into Brown next to the green
temp number two oh okay
you're just kidding attempt number three
I'm gonna use this brush I think I
really need this brush it's kind of the
only one that would work for this I'm
gonna clean off the eye primer what is
this attempt number twenty-seven there
we go now we're talking having a little
bit of trouble with this one getting it
right where I want it
let's try this one there isn't quite a
brush for what you need for that area
like I'm having issues here I'm trying
like 20 different brushes I just took a
warmer brown shade to try and blend that
out some more alright now let me attempt
to replicate that on the other side I
think that's as good as we're gonna get
I looked at my phone and that just took
me about eight minutes to do that just
that normally that step would take me
about 45 seconds probably so I'm gonna
go ahead and blend out those edges you
guys are gonna be seeing this chopped
down into about two minutes but I don't
think I've ever spent so long on my
eyeshadow I would definitely pass on the
eye brush set the rose gold one not
worth your time trying to make them work
okay so looking at the brushes I think
there were only two that I didn't use
this brush which is for like gel
eyeliner I never ever ever use gel liner
like I actually can't remember the last
time I did and then this brush it
doesn't look like I used either but this
is another one that you could use for
like a highlight I think this one was
just more angled or you could use it as
an eye brush but again it's pretty large
I guess we could do it let's use it
let's do a little lip contour so I'm
gonna take my Catrice prime and fine on
this little angled brush I'm just gonna
do a little under the lip contour it
just makes your lips look a little bit
more plump creates that shadow under
there that's really the only place I
like contouring sometimes I'll do a
little bit on my nose right here and
right here but if I do my nose up here
it looks way too like thin
on my face shape so if I do contour my
nose it's right here just to like
emphasize the shape a little bit now I
think we only didn't use one oh we
didn't use this giant shadow brush -
this one I don't think I would use for
all over lid shade like I said you could
use this to carve out the brows
underneath the brows let's use it for a
brow bone highlight getting all these
ideas now I'm just gonna go in with this
highlight shade since I have it right
here and put that right under the brow
bone again I don't know if you guys can
see that but the shadow just like flies
off this type of bristle so I'm gonna go
quickly finish up my eye makeup put on
some lipstick and then I'll be right
back and we'll kind of wrap up my final
thoughts
okay so just finish up my makeup all I
did was put mascara on my usual Too
Faced better than sex I know you used to
face schoolgirl both sets are only four
bucks but with that being said I still
don't think you should waste your 4
bucks on these I'm not impressed with
either brush set I definitely prefer
some of the brushes that I tried out in
the Amazon brush set video I obviously
could make it work I just think it took
about five times longer to do my makeup
than it normally does looking at these
the only one that stands out that I
would say is actually decent is the
blending brush that I used in this set
but overall concluding thoughts I would
just say check out the Amazon brush
video if you guys enjoyed this video
though don't forget to give it a thumbs
up let me know down below if there are
any brush sets that you want me to try
out whether they're super high-end or
super super cheap and affordable I'm
gonna have both of these linked in the
description box along with everything
else that's on my face the rest of the
makeup if you're new here and you want
to stick around don't forget to
subscribe I upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time I
love you guys thanks for watching see
you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
