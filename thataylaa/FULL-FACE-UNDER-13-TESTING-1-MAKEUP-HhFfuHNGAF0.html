half a cup of coffee right now who have
I become
all right so today we are doing this
look this was a full face look for under
$13 I hope I come to that correctly this
counted like five hundred times all of
the products I used in this video we're
from shop miss a calm everything on shop
miss a is one dollar which is frickin
amazeballs I've gotten my lashes off of
there for years they have awesome false
lashes not only do they have dollar
makeup on there but they also have
dollar brushes dollar accessories hair
accessories jewelry I love filming the
dollar makeup tree makeup tree I love
filming the Dollar Tree makeup challenge
video so I feel like this is kind of
another challenge just with different
products if you miss that video you can
go watch it right here like I mentioned
in that video I love trying out
different makeup no matter what the
price tag is I feel like a product is a
product if it's good it's good if it's
bad it's bad
the price tag shouldn't influence that
so whenever I do these videos I try and
come into it with an open mind some
product shock you some are worth a
dollar but I say thank you to shop si
for collaborating with me on this video
they're actually hosting a giveaway for
you guys which rocks there's going to be
three different winners all the details
for the giveaway will be linked down
below if you click that link it'll take
you to my blog which is where you can
enter the giveaway of the Rafflecopter
it's just a super easy way for me to
randomly choose winners let's stop
talking and get into the makeup if you
want to see how I got this look right
here you're in the right place just keep
watching I did film this intro after the
rest of the video so if I say shop
missed a couple times instead of shot
miss a don't kill me
all right guys it is 7:30 in the morning
Cheers so I'm not counting tools in the
price of this whole thing just because
usually you have your own tools but if
you are looking for some affordable
brushes or sponges I wanted to show you
that they do have a kabuki brush I also
got the round one this is by AOA Studio
this is the f1 and the round one is f4
and then I also picked up one of the AOA
Wonder blender sponges which looks like
this I've already dampened it might try
this on half of my face but first I
think I'm gonna go in with this flat top
brush so I got two different foundation
options here and the first one is the
Santi two-in-one concealer in Foundation
both of these are in the lightest shade
this is ivory and then I have this Santi
this just says liquid foundation so this
one on the back says it's a medium
coverage and this one sounds like it's
full coverage yes is complete coverage
so obviously I'm gonna go in with this
one hope in the shade of this is light
enough we will find out I just want to
restate that I'm still in the Sony
camera so it does blur my skin right now
it's not picking up on any of this stuff
when I go out and I don't have the
blurring feature on so I don't know this
is just what it does so this is what my
skin looks like right now am I actually
trying to zoom in and see if it still
blurs it okay it looks like that blurs
it less that it just turned everything
blue I'm going to keep it on this for
the foundation probably just so you can
actually see my skin whoa
that was suprising so this is the
concealer and foundation has like a
full-on concealer wand so I guess I'm
just going to use that to put some of
this on the back of a palette actually
what am i doing I should just squeeze
this out pretty thick formula we'll see
how that applies this foundation there
it is right there since this is supposed
to be a concealer and foundation I'm not
going to go in ahead of time and like
spot conceal I'm just going to apply it
like a wood foundation this brush is
actually feeling super soft applying
this like it normally do if you're new
here I have combination skin with cystic
acne my skin is actually pretty clear
right now for me oh this is actually
applying pretty nice I do foundation
Friday every single Friday on my channel
and I also have 15 days of foundation
coming up which is the second series
which basically where we testing you
Foundation every single day for 15 days
so with the amount I applied definitely
not full complete coverage you can still
see acne and just some freckles and
stuff coming through right here but it
looks pretty nice on the skin like it
looks very smooth so let's do the other
side I'll probably go in for a second
layer just to get a little bit more
coverage on the areas that I need it
brush is applying it pretty well I would
say high light coverage and it applies
kind of like a gel almost instead of
going in for a second layer right off
the bat I'm going to take that concealer
one that it comes with and I'm just
going to kind of spot conceal a little
bit I'm getting some brush hairs coming
out and I have this brush which might be
an eye brush but we're gonna use it for
concealers this is the aoa 103
definitely and i brush that's okay even
using this as concealer it doesn't have
a ton of coverage so i'm just going to
go in with a tiny bit more on the brush
that we first used i burn my neck with
the curling iron the other day battle
wound
it's not really giving me any more
coverage so i think that's about as good
as we're gonna get
i got this just color concealer it says
it's waterproof invisible cover
concealer so i'm gonna try this for
under the eyes this looks like it is
cruelty free let's see if this one is oh
this is also cruelty free very creamy
again this looks like more of a sheer
concealer i'm not using primer today so
i'm going to put this on my eyelid to
serve in as a base lopes way too much
have this Prisma true fusion pressed
powder this is in the lightest shade i'm
swashes to see how light it is it looks
pretty dark okay here's what I'm going
to do I'm just going to apply this to
parts of my face where we're going to be
putting bronzer on and blush just so it
blends out easier yeah you can see that
just darkened everything up so to bronze
up the face i'm using the santi mineral
pressed galaxy powder I don't think this
one looked this dark online so we're
going to make it work but this is like a
more red toned which I really like then
obviously we have like a caramel color
I might actually use some of these on my
eyes as well I think I'm just going to
swirl the two and hope that this isn't
for super data this reminds me of Mac
give me son
who just got way too much I apply a
little bit of this to my temples just
because this is pretty intense so I want
to match it looking like I just got back
from the Bahamas for blush I have this
quad by amuse beauty well it was
actually I mirror on the back this is in
the shade hot fuchsia is four different
shades in here I think I'm going to take
this light pink shade I'm usually all
about the like light baby pink we're
just going to take a tiny bit since we
already have a ton of color on my cheeks
the blush looks a little patchy for
eyebrows I'm just going to do some brow
gel this is the clean color Framus brows
hoping this doesn't look like red OS is
way too late I'm going to take us fully
and just brush that through a little bit
what is this it got set pretty fast
actually in my brows so highlight this
is where I messed up a little bit
because I ordered this and I don't know
why because I'm pretty sure I got this
exact same thing from Dollar Tree in the
Dollar Tree haul and I didn't like it as
a highlight and my breath being like
super glittery so not sure what I'm
going to use for highlight because this
was the only option that I tried looks
pretty glittery but I might actually wet
this and see if I can kind of just dab
it on my cheeks and that might help to
take away some of the glitter and just
go in with my finger and kind of mix it
this might work
fingers crossed there we go nice glow
put a little bit of that on the tip of
my nose and Cupid's bow so for eyes I
have this LA Colors matte eyeshadow
palette I kind of want to do an all Matt
eye look I just asked you guys on
snapchat if you want to see all Matt or
something with mint green and all Matt
has been winning so far so I think we're
going to go with that to start off I'm
actually going to take this shade right
here from the bronzer I'm gonna start by
blending this into the crease a little
bit if you don't have a ton of eyeshadow
you can always use your bronzer or
contour shades or even face powder
sometimes
as shadows oh I'm going to go in with
this LA Colors quad right here I think
I'm going to take this shade right here
I guess I'm just putting those right in
the kind of outer third area just one
isn't super pigmented but it's blending
out okay might try something risky and
attempt to put this on the lid actually
I honestly think this thing has as much
pigmentation as that eyeshadow palette
I'm actually going to go back in with
this camel colored shade and just put
this a little bit more into the crease
just to warm it up I'm going to blend
that same shade down onto the lower lash
line going back in with that bronzer
warm shade and using my finger and that
gives a lot better color payoff also
totally could use shadows like this for
your brows what really could have worked
actually my add a tiny bit yeah I'm
going to take this shade right here and
just add a tiny bit to kind of give it a
more cool tones brow I'm gonna take this
same kind of angled brush and just go
down on the lower lash line with some of
this black in here
so for liquid eyeliner I have this what
is this LA Colors smudge proof liquid
eyeliner this is brown
oh no this brush is like not a point
this looks like a full-on paint brush
I'm actually going to use a brush that
usually from use for my brows I think
and just dip this into the product you
could use your eyebrow brush you could
use any kind of like super fine tipped
brush not sure if I want to do a wing or
just kind of smudge it out you're like a
wing is a little risky hmm let's go all
out let's do the wing and I am going to
be putting on falsies so that'll kind of
pull it all together
once I was dry I might go in and refine
it a little bit but let's start on the
other eye
okay that one turned into like a full-on
wing so I might need to do that on this
side
oh no okay definitely not the best wings
I've ever done in my life I really have
anything I can like clean it up with
we'll see how it looks once I have
falsies on shot mrs. freakin awesome for
false lashes as
much where I get like 80% of my false
lashes the Cara s Ford's are my absolute
favorite from there when I was ordering
stuff for this video they were actually
out of stock of the s4 so I picked up
the 43 and the 48 by Kara these have a
really nice thin band I just checked
before this video and the s4 czar back
in stock the Kara 48 are on
I love these lashes these feel so
weightless because the band of these are
so thin to cover up the band a little
bit and glue I'm just going to go back
in with this black shadow and kind of
smudge it out on top put the lashes on
also applied some bottom mascara Shama
has one dollar mascara as well lips are
what I'm most excited about because I
have five billion options of liquid
lipsticks to show you guys they had
liquid lipsticks like what the heck
think I'm just going to swatch all these
I think for this look I'm going to go
for more of like a mob tone probably one
of these shades okay so here are the
swatches of all the lipsticks that I
bought the only one that was more like a
moosie formula was this last one right
here so I'm just gonna go down and read
the names offs first red shade is Santi
matte liquid lipstick zero for this next
one is Princesa zero seven Dahlia this
bubblegum pink shade is Santi and this
also says zero for so I'm not sure why
that is the same number as this red one
this purple shade is clean color madly
matte in the shade one six three five
untamed clean color one six zero three
majesty is this shade right here clean
color one six four six is the next shade
over right here okay this shade I'm kind
of in love with and I think I might go
with this one for today's look this is
the clean color one six zero two clay
this is Santi in the shade ten this last
one right here this was one that's more
of a moosie formula the rest of these
two watch pretty liquid so there you go
all a dollar so I think I'm going to go
into the clean color madly matte in the
shade clay this just looks super pretty
kind of rising of the color pop trap
smells like sunscreen like a really
tropical sunscreen oh heck yeah it's
going on really nice not patchy at all
might add a tiny bit of majesty just to
the outer just to kind of make it more
of like an hombre shaded feels a little
bit sticky right now but
it's just because it's not fully dry it
all right so this is the final look if I
just counted correctly this full face is
$13 I did count the two liquid lipstick
shades so if I just used one liquid
lipstick shade it would have been $12
everything except the face which
definitely oxidized quite a bit and
looking pretty bronzed I think turned
out pretty well I'm really excited to
play around more with these liquid
lipsticks and see how they are totally
forgot to use this I just realized
people use this in an upcoming
foundation Friday just so you guys can
see by the way probably going to get
questions this choker is from forever 21
and then this one here is from Brian
