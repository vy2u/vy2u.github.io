to not poke myself in the eye ball with
this
all right so today I'm going to be
attempting to do a full face of makeup
with my bad hand my opposite hand so I
am right-handed I'm be doing all my
makeup with my left hand which currently
is mandated rclbeauty101 originally did
this video about four years ago and then
it just kind of recently caught on in
the YouTube world and made its around
some like original video down below but
I am very curious to see how this is
going to go not only am I not
ambidextrous but I actually feel like
I'm on ambidextrous anti ambidextrous is
there word for this let's see there is a
word the opposite of ambidextrous is
Amba sinister you're equally shitty with
both hands so that is me if someone goes
to hand me something with my left hand I
literally have to reach and grab it with
my right hand or else it'll fall on the
floor so this is going to be great but
filmed a different video this morning
I'm trying to pre-record a lot since I'm
gonna be gone for ten days so I just
wiped off all the makeup wash my face
let's go in with primer some of the
stuff is going to be like first
impressions to stuff that I haven't
tried out yet so this is the Revlon
brightening primer I use the blurring
primer in a recent video so I have to
like no I got to pump it with my good
hand okay so like I need to like tie
back the sand or something oh this
smells really strong like chemicals like
I'm pressing extra hard right now brush
or makeup sponge going to be easier I
almost feel like the makeup sponge will
be for foundation I'm using the Estee
Lauder Double Wear maximum cover this is
like the only foundation I have right
now it is dark enough for this tanner
I need my morphe sponge and pounce this
thing in Oh God even putting this on the
palette feels weird I hope this is gonna
be dark enough oh yeah I think this will
work
oh this motion doesn't actually feel
that weird oh when you actually have to
put it somewhere it does like going
around my nose and stuff look at that
coverage for literally covers everything
a full review on that foundation from 15
days of foundation by the way I'm going
to be announcing the next 15 days of
foundation dates soon in an upcoming
probably in a shout out and schmooze or
something oldest site is harder this
looks weird this literally looks like
it's someone else's hand right now
does it not what the heck I think also
give my hand is like wider than my body
right now this is so bizarre okay I need
to focus this side is way harder for
some reason because I'm going like cross
whoo
arms getting sore
kind of covering my eyebrow because why
not took me about ten times longer than
usual but we got there
so for concealer when use my Maybelline
instant age rewind concealer this is in
shade light oh oh this is different I'm
gonna try and count instead of there we
go hmm that almost just slid into my a
goal well I feel like I'm doing those
paints did you guys ever have those when
you were kid like the things that you
push down and there at the dots is the
pointy side this could be a hazard
everything is taking a lot of such like
literally having to think where to put
my hand right now
I don't poke myself in the eye ball at
some point during this video that's
going to be a success all right
concealers on so to set my under eyes
I'm going to mix my usual a translucent
correcting powder by Physicians Formula
with the darker shade of their powder
this is the mineral face powder and
translucent light this one is too dark
for my under eyes right now this one is
too light so I'm just going to mix it
too I feel like I just yeah just are
decreased oh what am I doing wrong Han
okay that's felt way too normal for a
second Oh
holding brushes is fun so like I should
close my eyes for this can you even
attempt to have a cute face while doing
this right now yeah this left side of my
face is definitely easier I don't need
to powder my face with this foundation
it's very matte and dries down like it
sets so for bronze Ehrmantraut the elf
blush and bronzing contour palette to
the shade st. Lucia Cameron Bure if this
is a new shade or I've used this one
before I think it isn't in shade you
have like a peachy blush and then this
contour bronzer shade so I'm going to
take my wet and wild brush let's do some
contouring I don't remember how
pigmented this is
oh that shade is nice I feel like every
bronzer looks so much better when you
have a tan on they just look so much
less orange always tapping at the
hardest part though which I turn my
brush usually yeah only on this angle
okay taking my sweet time over here
blending I'm going to do a little nose
contour action which I've been into
lately take this cap blondie brush I do
not like this for concealer I bought a
couple Kat Von D brushes try out and
this one I like semi like but I don't
really think it's worth the money I'm
just kind of using it as a nose contour
since I didn't like it for concealer use
that same elf products all I've been
doing is going underneath here I haven't
been doing the sides just right under
here who got a blown that out it's like
I got chocolate on my nose I can hear my
nose like cracking when I do this set
normal and I'm going to do a little
under the lip contour which just makes
your bottom lip look bigger feel like
the face is the easy part the eyes are
going to be a different story
eyebrows that anyone think about then
try out this same blush in this palette
that's pretty looks really natural this
is really natural looking like you have
to layer it on if you want it to show up
on my fair skin this will probably look
really nice I want to try this take C
and merriam strobe and bronze glow
palette there's a really pretty kind of
pink shade right here this one on the
bliss like champagne pop I think I'm
going to take this one right now dip it
in where you are you add like a natural
kind of glow oh well grab in a little
under eye highlight here feel like I'm
just doing everything in slow motion do
the Cupid's bow nose each a little bit I
think we've made it to the point where I
have to grow some balls and do some
brows right now I mean I benefit
precisely my brow pencil and let's
spoolie these things oh Jesus well
that's a good strategy just move your
face after the brush yeah just going to
follow my brow that's it
we got this
I don't think I'm going to add any extra
shape I'm just like literally following
my brows and filling them in a little
bit I feel like I'm going the wrong way
for some reason not as bad as I thought
so far I don't drink myself I really
like the strategy of just moving your
face okay how do we even hold on offense
oh oh that one went out a little
far all right that one's having some
issues a little bumpy I think I'm going
to quit while I'm ahead on this one but
priming eyes I'm using Makeup Forever
aqua Excel and m-52 slides us on these
things are awesome I mentioned these in
June rays and rejects I think I just got
primer all up in that eyelash think
we're onto eye shadow I'm going to throw
it back and try out the Too Faced
chocolate bar palette I haven't used
this in so long I don't remember the
last time probably two years ago mine
doesn't open all the way don't know what
happened there first I think I'm going
to take the white chocolate shade in
here to like set that kind of and take
it on my finger Pat that in if
eyeshadows usually blend really easily
so I'm hoping they're going to help
sister out I don't want the shades
salted-caramel do you guys say caramel
or caramel is to say caramel then I made
the transition okay here we go
put this into the crease whoo how's
ideal just windshield wiper motion so
it's all I'm doing I'm gripping
everything so tight that my body's like
cramping let's get some circles going
stepping it up I'm going to take the
shade creme brulee deep kind of gold
color right here it's like in antique
bronze kind of color that just did not
come off on a literal anything coming
off here we go needed to warm up a
little bit
I think the shade is just should be it's
like not really showing up at all that
two-faced shade isn't doing it for me so
let's use this one now I'm going to
deepen up the crease a little bit and go
in with the shade semi-sweet which is
this bro you can't see this brown
shade right here slow and steady wins
the race you know I'm saying how in the
heck are we going to do liquid liner do
most people do liquid liner in these
videos on you and I feel like it
wouldn't be a full challenge if you
didn't try it
run back in with a blending brush I'm
going to take marzipan for an inner
corner highlight I think the shade will
work on there kind of like a peachy
color actually going to mix that too
with champagne truffle which is a really
light pink shimmery shade there we go
I'm going to go back in with salted
caramel the first shade see now I'm
saying caramel okay time for liquid
liner I've been really into the Kat Von
D tattoo liner lately still of my
Physicians Formula ultra black don't get
me wrong but this one is a close second
this is gonna be something else I'm
gonna get this mirror as close as
possible to my face I don't even know
where to start with this definitely
going to table it I have my elbow on the
table right now I think my one light
goal right now is to not poke myself in
the eye ball with this so far so good
the wing is what I'm worried about I'm
just gonna kind of hope for the best
year okay debating whether I should try
and make that line a little bit thinner
on the end and bring it out more or just
go with a sick wing oh that was a bad
idea
Wow that went really well see how this
one goes I've got an is the other way
well this is an angle I've never done
liner at okay my body actually doesn't
move this much okay
at least I got a finer point on that one
now let's connect him that one went
better I'm using my Catrice glamour doll
mascara I usually use this on top of Too
Faced better than sex
but that one is packed I think I'm just
going to blink like keep blinking so
don't actually have to move the wand a
lot give it a little wiggle something is
stuck together the entire wand almost
just landed right on my cheek whoa that
was really close to my Bible this is
almost scarier than the top I think yes
holy sees my hands are shaking
right now
going to use this covergirl melting pot
in 125 so I want to see how these are
can tell if a squeeze tube would be
easier or harder than a liquid lipstick
right now I might get a different red
liquid lipstick okay I'm going to
attempt to use Maybelline vivid matte
liquid in 35 so say rebel red no idea
what that does 11 look really patriotic
right now oh they smell horrible so
usually my strategy with liquid lipstick
is to do like one line I don't pick up
my wand at all I just do one line so I'm
going to try that here we go hey that
wasn't bad and do this last I like to
let the rest of it dry so I can push
over the ring and then for my top I'd
usually go in in and then down in one
line
this is our now I keep other than
looking like I'm ready for the 4th of
July right now I think that went much
better than anticipated eyeliner was
definitely where we went downhill a
little bit and this eyebrow this thing
is like a frickin cones this one at
least has like a point to it I would
recommend only trying this out if you
have like two hours because I think I
did everything 25 times slower than
normal I don't know here it is let me
