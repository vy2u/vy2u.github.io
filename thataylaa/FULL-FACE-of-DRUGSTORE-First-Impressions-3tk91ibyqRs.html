did my voice just go so today we are
doing a full-face drugstore look I am
currently filming a first impression
video on the wet-and-wild cover all for
foundation Friday this video is up when
you guys are watching this so I'm going
to link that down below if you want to
see the face products that I'm wearing
right now but the rest of the face
bronzer highlight eyes lips everything I
did first impressions on drugstore
products pretty much like 95% of these
products are first impressions for me
stuff that I haven't tried it all before
so if you want to see how I got this
look you're in the right place just keep
watching
alright so my face is already done
because I'm currently filming a first
impression for foundation Friday on the
wet and wild cover all cream Foundation
and powder for concealer I use the
Catrice liquid camouflage concealer and
then I set it with this elf powder
finish HD powder all of that was shown
in that first impression video which is
already live so if you want to see that
I will link it in the little eye which
is somewhere over here
and in the description box down below so
I have a bunch of new drugstore stuff on
the fall beauty haul that I just did I
just has red and a bunch of colors going
on so I kind of want to do like a red
lip and then just more basic I not sure
if I want to fill in the brows yet I'm
going to try this elf okay there's
actually nothing written on here but I
think it was called like the clear wax
pencil
I have permanent brows on and I do like
my brows to be darker than my hair even
when I'm finally silver I am going to be
doing darker brows I just like the way
it looks I think it looks a little bit
more like grungy and edgy a lot of times
when I put foundation on it kind of
covers the brows a little bit since they
are micro bladed on though I want
something that can bring back the color
a little bit so I'm trying out a couple
different clear brow products today well
this is like really glue in those hairs
down this could also be good if you use
powder product a waxy formula can help
keep that powder on then I'm going to go
in with the NYX control-freak this is a
clear eyebrow gel
probably don't need both of these but
why not well this is a huge as one this
is like a mascara wand I wish they made
this wand a little bit smaller so for
the face I'm going to try out this
summer of love triple baked bronzer by
makeup revolution
can get makeup revolution at Ulta now
and it looks like it's pretty nice and
light so let's try this very nice and
subtle do you have pale skin this one
could be a winner folks I'm assuming I
just got the lightest shade it doesn't
really say on here definitely has a
little bit of Sheen to it but I feel
like it just makes it look kind of
natural feeling this feuless when
applied tiny bit of this to the temples
just because looks very nice and natural
this is definitely one of the lightest
bronzers I found this is a winner guys
this is a winner
for blush I'm going to try this NYX
baked blush illuminator and bronzer I
don't know it's is called a bronzer this
is in the shade 11 chiffon haven't tried
any of the NYX baked blushes before I
did swatch one of them the other shade
that I got in the hall and it felt
pretty stiff so we'll see I don't feel
like a whole lot is coming off there we
go you definitely have to really like
blend your brush in here to get some
product off not as pigmented as their
normal bushes for a highlight I have
this goddess of love makeup revolution
these names are very dramatic a triple
beige highlighter I think this is a
shade goddess of faith this is a very
pinky a little bit of champagne in there
this looks really pretty we'll see so
I'm gonna take my favorite Sigma fo3
brush I love this to highlight I don't
know how big went to this is so oh it is
pigmented oh this is pretty
it's intense but it also has this like
sheen to it this is kind of unique shade
I don't have very many pinky shades like
this this is super pretty oh heck yeah
you know those highlight is that just a
bomb on your nose getting a super pretty
sheen to my face so far really feeling
the two summer of love products or
whatever okay I'm going to set my face
since I do that every single day should
I'm using the NYX dewy finish
ray I kind of just rotate through all my
setting sprays and I'm like
use them up because I literally have 30
this doesn't alter the finish of the
whole lot so for the first impression
video don't worry I don't really feel
like this makes my face that much more
dewy oh I got a craving for an Egg
McMuffin so far eyes like I said I just
kind of want to do a simple winged liner
I am trying out new products though so
this is the NYX eyeshadow base in the
shade 0-1 white NYX jumbo eye pencil in
milk used to be my jam when it came to
priming so I've never tried this pot one
I'm just going to use a brush to apply
it to the lid white bases are great if
you're doing like intense colors on top
or if you just are pale and you need
something that's really going to cover
up and prime at the same time it's nice
and creamy but not too creamy where it
feels like a shadows aren't going to
blend on top I want to apply a tiny bit
of this below my brow just to kind of
carve it out but not recommend doing
this if you don't have pale skin or else
you're gonna have like a white line
under your eyebrow I mentioned it in one
of my other videos but I'm going to be
at beautycon New York in a few weeks
which I'm super excited about and I
think I'm going to be doing a meet up
the night before beauty cone about
Friday so if you're in the New York area
would love to do a bain-marie go meet up
and chill with some of you guys I've
been posting about it on all my socials
so make sure you're following me there
Instagram Twitter snapchat you know the
deal that's this tiny hair that I kind
just want to pull out okay what is going
on
that hair is just live in his life and
wants to chill right there today for the
class color I'm just going to take a
bronzer i'm using this l'oreal glam
bronze zero 1 light pale just because
it's matte and summer blood 1 wasn't
totally matte you can take literally any
matte bronzer that you have pretty much
my everyday look is literally just
putting a bronzer in my crease and then
something on the inner corner just super
quick and easy i'm all about this
highlight shade right now then with that
same bronzer i'm just going to take a
more compact brush just to get a little
bit more intense color right in the
crease and you'll see that you just get
a little bit more dimension when you do
that even though it's with the same
product brushes are key folks brushes
are key on the lid i'm going to take my
essence eyeshadow and 0
one snowflake this is like my holy grail
highlight for the face it's a couple
bucks but if you use it on your eyes it
is a lot more subtle than on the face
for some reason so what I want to use
something that isn't like too intense
but I just want a lid color I go in with
this for the inner corner I'm going to
try using that same highlighter this
summer of goddess of love I'm going to
be trying out this ELF gel liner for the
first time it's just a black gel liner
been on the hunt for a good gel liner
the Inglot one I love when it first goes
on but it creases every single time no
matter what I do let me know down below
what your favorite gel liners are a
drugstore or high-end whatever something
so satisfying about a brand new product
like this it's like when you open a new
tub of butter favorite gel liner brush
lately has been the morphe e39 and it's
kind of like a rounded brush but it's
super firm so it's easy to get that wing
it is really creamy and easy to apply I
don't think it's quite as black as the
Inglot but for three bucks or whatever
this is since I am doing a first
impression today on the face products
you guys will see how the rest of these
wear so you'll see by the end of the day
if this is still black and on yeah not
quite as black as I would like it it's
taking so much concentration right now
okay
thoughts on the liner not totally in
love but not bad at all I'm not going to
be putting on falsies today because
whenever I do first impression videos I
have to peel them off my eyes hate lash
glue so I'm trying out this L'Oreal
voluminous superstar red carpet black
this is like a double-ended mascara
never use this before it has a number
one side and a number two side well
interesting curvy brush so this is like
the primer I don't want to get back into
using eyelash primer for a while I was
diehard Mac prep and prime sometimes it
just makes your mascara going way easier
with like less coats I'm going to go in
with the number two side and this is
actually a different one this one is
more like that shaped and the other one
was kind of bat shaped oh that's a great
description Taylor this is definitely
one of those mascaras that kind of
clumps certain lashes together but I
actually like that look because
sometimes I feel like it makes a look
more like falsies when they're super
separated I'm actually not going to do
bottom mascara today I just like the
look of winged and red lip without that
bottom mascara so for lips one of these
is new to me this is the J Kat rocker
chic Velvet Touch waterproof gel lip
liner you can get Jacob UD online Ulta
now and then the lipstick I'm going to
be using is the Milani best red this is
one of my favorite six that I haven't
talked about in a while but I used to
always use this so one of those Reds
that just makes your teeth look super
white very fine point I don't feel like
I'm using a toothpick to line my lips
right now you could totally just use
this as a lipstick and just fill it
totally in it is one of those liners
that if you try and go over it it kind
of crumbles a little bit
so this is the final look
overall I think I'm most impressed with
because two products love this bronzer
and this highlight blush I would use
again definitely more on like the
natural side and you really have to get
a ton of product in order for it to show
up on your face mascara I totally use
again I like this but mascaras one of
those things that's totally different
for everyone I like the look of kind of
like fake more not clumpy but like
together lashes if you know what I mean
so if you want to see how this full face
wore throughout the day and held up you
can go watch the wet and wild cover all
foundation friday video if you guys
liked this video make sure you give it a
thumbs up you can always let me know
down below what looks you want to see
next
love you guys thanks for watching see
