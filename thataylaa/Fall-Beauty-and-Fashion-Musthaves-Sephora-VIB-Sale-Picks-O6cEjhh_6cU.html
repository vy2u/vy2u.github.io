right so let's jump into my
recommendations for Sephora these are
kind of a mix of products that I
absolutely love and I've been using for
a while and that are good to pick up for
the first time when you have this 20%
off coupon or ones that are kind of like
full inspired and that would be fun to
pick up for gifts or for yourself I
wanted to mention two foundations that I
think are totally worth it and that are
a little bit pricier this is a perfect
time to pick up any of those products
that have been on your list for a while
because you're gonna save some money the
first is the Marc Jacobs remarkable
foundation if you guys have been
following my channel at all you know
that I love this foundation one of my
most frequently asked questions is what
is my top top favorite foundation ever
and I think high-end let's say Marc
Jacobs remarkable this has in sane
coverage but the cool thing about this
is that you can totally customize this
however you want it it has this little
dropper thing I'm a full review on this
so I'm not gonna go super in-depth about
it but you can basically mix it in with
moisturizer a lighter coverage
foundation if you want lighter coverage
just dab it on to conceal there's just
so many different ways you can use this
product and it is 100% worth the money
to me another foundation I think is
worth to pick up is the Josie Maran
vibrancy fluid foundation I have a full
review on this as well this one is just
so stunning this mixes well with other
foundations you can wear it by itself
the shade rg5 is a beautiful pale shade
this is super dewy foundation so if you
like more matte this one probably isn't
for you but if you have dry skin I mean
I have combination skin and I love this
but it definitely gives you more of a do
beautiful foundation totally worth it in
my opinion I show you guys a ton of
face masks on snapchat because I pretty
much wear a face mask every single night
which some people think is bad for your
skin I don't know I just love face masks
it really relaxes me and one of my
favorites lately has been the fresh
Umbreon clay purifying mask this thing
is freaking price
see I think it's normally like $65 so if
you can pick it up during the sale do it
it's just so detoxifying I feel like it
just brings everything to the surface my
skin feels super soft afterwards and
clean and I've used literally like half
of this already the smell is like that
naturally smell but it's not disgusting
like doesn't smell like straight-up dirt
they still have a nice scent to it this
one is a more recent find I think this
actually might be pretty new I've been
using this the past few weeks and this
is the it by by under-eye eye cream
I'm usually pretty bad about remembering
to apply eye cream every single night
which you should helps with wrinkles and
just dryness under there unless I find a
product that I'm like so jazzed about
that I can't wait to put it on my face
it is super thick so it feels like it's
giving your under eyes a nice layer of
moisture under there it smells so good
it smells so fresh I don't know if
you'll be able to see with the lights
but this is like a light teal color it
looks like tiffany blue basically and I
just think that is so satisfying I put
it on at night I've also been putting it
on in the morning under my concealer and
it just preps my skin under there really
nicely for under-eye concealer like a
just I can see over 25 times really nice
if you're in the market for a new eye
cream okay so this next thing I had been
putting off getting for forever because
I just feel like sometimes certain
products are just so hyped up from
Instagram and YouTube and almost puts me
off from buying them I don't know why I
feel like it has like the reverse effect
on me but I finally caved and tried out
the modern renaissance palette by
Anastasia Beverly Hills do you guys say
Anastasia or anastacio I don't know so
this is what the palette looks like
you've probably seen it five billion
times at this point I I get it I feel
like once you actually put these on your
eyes it kind of all makes sense the way
they blend out and just sit on your eyes
and the pigmentation they're soft but
they're super pigmented they don't have
a ton of fallout they don't blend away
when you go to blend them out they're
just stunning they really are and the
colors are very fall-like this would be
really good present for someone for the
holidays if they're into makeup the only
thing I don't like is this packaging I
just like this is gonna get so dirty
it's like a velvet packaging reminds me
of the first Naked palette just kind of
cheap packaging it's like car
bordered on the inside so not a fan of
the packaging but the actual product is
really nice this one is not gonna be for
everyone but I have to throw it in here
because it's pricey and if you can get
it on sale do it I actually think they
have this in a holiday set right now as
well this is the Olli Henrickson and
invigorating night treatment
AJ complex I talked about this in a
favorites video
pretty recently I've been using this
every single night for probably a month
in half or two months now and this has
changed my skin when I see is it coming
to the surface now I put this on at
night all over my face after I tone and
wash and all that good stuff and the zit
just doesn't ever come forward it kind
of just like blocks it if you have acne
prone skin this is amazing totally worth
the money I will continue repurchasing
this forever next is the product that
I've been using for a few months now but
I've never I don't think talked about
this is the Too Faced melted matte
liquefied long wear lipstick these are
really nice and this kind of shocked me
because I hated the melted squeezy tube
two-faced products you know I'm talking
about those ones did not stay on it all
for me they just like ended up all over
my face basically these are like a
normal liquid lipstick formula of a
normal liquid lipstick applicator I'm
wearing this one right now this is in
the shade cool girl and this is the
shade I reach for most on me it's like a
deeper nude brown shade but if you have
a darker skin tone like when Kendall is
here she put this on and it looked like
a beautiful just normal nude shade for
her so depending on your skin tone
obviously the color of this is gonna
look different but as far as the formula
really long-lasting not super drying I
just really like the formula of these
another lip product is the anastasia
butterscotch lip gloss these lip glosses
are frickin pigmented I'm just gonna
swatch this for you so you can see but
this is like almost like a liquid
lipstick look at that super pigmented
this is like a beautiful peachy nude
color but it doesn't have too much
orange in it or too much pink the
formula of these kind of surprised me
it's very it's not sticky at all super
thin almost it feels very lightweight
and you could totally just wear this
just put on a lip liner don't even put
liner or whatever put this on it
literally just looks like glossy
lipstick on your lips smells like it
smells like yogurt actually smells like
vanilla yogurt is this something I want
to show you because I found this at
Sephora and I just thought this would be
perfect for a gift idea or for yourself
if you've just been wanting to try it
bite Beauty lipsticks this is a limited
edition set it comes in this super cute
gold packaging and then you get a little
tin with it and this has four shades of
their lipstick in here if you haven't
tried the bite Beauty lipstick formula
these are bomb there's something about
the formula of these that just feels so
good on your lips they stay on get four
shades in this little kit thing and they
have some really nice deeper shades for
fall and then just I'm gonna swatch
these so you can see oh you also get a
mirror and you realize that you get a
little mirror in this tomb I rarely go
through full lipstick tubes just because
I use so many different products so for
me if there's anything like this where I
can get a sample size or like a tinier
mini version I do it because it's just a
good way to try out a bunch of different
colors without having to commit to the
full size so here are some swatches this
dark shade is Nouri then we have
honeycomb which looks beautiful I cannot
wait to put this one on my lips I
haven't warned that one yet
this is pepper and then here's fig the
first three are totally on my alley this
one's like a little too pink for me you
didn't get this and split this up for
gifts like just take a couple of
lipsticks out and put it with something
else as a present if you've had any
perfumes that you've been wanting to get
now is the time because you can get them
on sale I wanted to show you guys one of
my all-time favorite perfumes and then
also one that I plan on getting during
the sale so my all-time favorite is the
Thierry Mugler Mugler still don't know
how to say her name
alien I'm not gonna attempt to describe
a scent but if you want to know my
perfume taste I have an older perfume
collection video I'll link down below I
feel like that's the best way to tell if
you're gonna like a scent if we have a
lot of mutual sense that we both like
you might also like this one this is
definitely more of like a nighttime
going out perfume but this is definitely
one of those perfumes where people will
stop you and ask what you're wearing it
just has that scent the next one I got a
sample of and I'm definitely gonna get
the rollerball size of this this is a
new perfume and it's the Elizabeth and
James Nirvana bourbon I've seen a lot of
like ads for the
the magazines and just heard a lot about
this perfume the packaging is beautiful
as this gold bottle I'm actually gonna
spray this because I'm not wearing
perfume right now the scent of this if
you like alien you will definitely like
this perfume it almost smells like more
of a daytime warm version of alien this
one is definitely more like amber musk
so those are my picks for Sephora I'm
going to show you some of my fashion
favorites now how do we find enthroned
some of my must-have fashion pieces for
fall
I have very simple style I'm all about
flannels black white leather grey it's
pretty much it I'm just gonna like try
them on and talk to you guys as I have
them on so let's go do that alright so
the first thing I want to show you is
this vest from Old Navy this is one of
the comfiest things that I own it has
like I don't know if this is actual down
probably not but its fleece lined it
comes in a bunch of different colors you
can zip it up they have a really cute
gray like tweed one that I want to get
when I bought this it was 26 bucks on
sale I think they're originally 34
around there which is a really good deal
for a vest I just feel like with this
and boots or even like a hoodie
underneath if it's raining
super cute make something super basic
look a little bit more put together if
you compare it with one of these scarves
these are such a good fine from forever
21 look at the pattern of these it's
like the chunky super big braided
material I have it in white and I also
got one in gray these were around twelve
or fourteen bucks from forever 21
they're super soft super warm you just
go like this put them over attempt to
not get foundation all over the place
there you go alright so next I have this
sweater dress paired with over the knee
boots that I've been so in love with by
the way everything I'm showing here
they're all from stores that you can get
cash back on eBay Nordstrom which I'm
about to show you these boots this
turtleneck sweater dress is from forever
21 not to stop dislike this is one of
those sweaters that you probably don't
want to wear for a super long time but I
love the color of this with these boots
they just look so cute when zoom out
super hard to get in the shot but I have
this
with these over-the-knee boots I love
the look of sweater dresses and just
dresses in general paired with over the
knee boots you have the little bit of
skin showing right here but it's still
like classy and wintery I have been on
the hunt for knee high boots for I can't
even tell you how long I finally found
the perfect pair these are by Franco
Sarto half of my shoes are by him
probably because he's like one of the
only brands that makes size fours and
smaller sizes but just the quality and
the way that his shoes fit our
perfection so I got these from
Nordstrom's these are definitely like an
investment they were totally worth it
for me because my big issue with over
the knee boots is that this part is
usually way too big for me these are the
first ones I've seen that have this
elastic behind here and so they actually
fit perfectly around my knees they don't
want too big and they're also not too
high which is another thing I was
looking for because they have this
chunky heel and I think it's only like a
two two and a half inch heel maybe
they're super easy to walk in they look
really cute going out the only thing is
that they're suede so if you live
somewhere where it rains like I do just
be careful because they are full-on
suede so you don't want to wear these
when it's like poor and raining outside
and I'm pretty sure I got around twelve
bucks cash back when I purchase these on
norstrom alright so last thing which
I've been wearing a shit-ton the last
probably month and a half are these
leggings these are from ASOS they're
like the leather look kind of leggings I
mention these in my fall haul video
these are the comfiest thing ever they
look like leather they have this really
tight band on the top so keeps the love
handles in the thing I really like if
you're more on the petite side is that
the bottoms are actually short enough
and the ankles are tight which is really
hard to find these shoes are Franco
Sarto as well but I like it because you
can actually get the ankle kind of look
which is really hard to do if you're
shorter because all of them are always
way too long so that was everything I
hope you guys like this video if you did
