all right so today we have a fall hall
gonna be completely honest all I'm
thinking about right now is eating my
leftover pizza not all this stuff is
like fall related I've just been doing
some trapping so I thought I'd show you
guys I'm going through a phase right now
where I'm like not satisfied with my
wardrobe situation feel like I wear the
same exact things every week so I just
wanted to get some new sweaters new
jackets new shoes that works so we have
a huge bag here this is from H&amp;amp;M I went
to H&amp;amp;M forever21 old maybe and then did
some online shopping
so first let's do forever 21 I got two
of these like huge baggy cable knit
sweaters these are those super slouchy
kind of sweaters they wear with leggings
and boots not too scratchy I ordered
these online so I wasn't sure but they
feel like they could be comfortable this
was only 1780 so freaking score I really
like this light grey shade I got this
pinky tan thing it's a little more tan
than I was envisioning and I'm not
really sure how I feel about this color
trying to branch out for a reference I
am a size small and they are really
oversized so I picked up this like
t-shirt dress thing on forever 21 and
it's literally just a super baggy giant
ass t-shirt the back has this cutout
which I thought was really cool and this
was only twelve eighty I picture wearing
this with like tights and the leather
jacket and heeled boots
it just is super comfy it's like it's a
good layering piece I did get this
necklace and I just wanted a good
necklace that I can wear with anything I
really like the look of wearing like
flannel with this kind of necklace I
just filmed a tutorial on classic makeup
which is why I'm dressed like this that
video will be up before this so link it
down below in case you want to go check
it out was the thing I really like
mixing like runs with these kind of
necklaces so I've been on the frickin
hunt for a black leather jacket mine
literally ripped down the arm I think I
went into literally 20 stores and no one
is carrying black leather jackets right
now I don't know what's going on I don't
know if they're not in style anymore
there's a little bizarre
hmm finally saved the day
try it on this is like a moto style
jacket is up with the cold H&amp;amp;M jackets
just always fit me perfectly my jean
jacket that I always wears from H&amp;amp;M I'll
show you this just fits perfectly i
don't plan on zipping this I never
really zip my leather jackets arms are
good not too long I like the little
crochet thing or whatever this is the
stitching ooh maybe we'll just keep it
on there was literally one leather
jacket in all of Nordstrom's what is
going on speaking of more trims like
that Segway I got this scarf from the BP
section and this is like obnoxiously
furry thing but it's so soft if they
made this in a blanket I would buy it it
doesn't have a name or anything but it
was twenty dollars from the BP section I
just love this I feel like this will be
good for like going out to dinner when
it gets cold out leather jacket boots
you know the situation them I just sleep
in this okay next I'm going to show you
a couple pairs of shoes that I got
online hot look is my place to go when I
buy shoes I have size 4 feet I know
wild so literally the only place I can
buy shoes is Nordstrom Rack online or in
the store or on hot look public always
has really awesome deals I picked up
these car leggings our Carlo what are
these franco sarch oh okay no Carlo
Franco start oh sorry - I'm not into
like big name brands or anything I
usually just buy what I like I really
liked these they're genuine leather so I
do have to waterproof them I like each
other super low heel that I can actually
walk in and I could wear these to work
or like walking around I just want to be
comfortable
they had these in black and I believe
they had a lighter color as well I just
feel like these will last me forever if
you haven't heard a pot look they're
basically a flash sale site just have
that first but I'll link them down below
in case you want to check it out I think
you might get $10 off your first order
if you sign up with that link they used
to do that next I was a little bit
seasonally confused when I ordered these
but I got sandals I am freaking in love
with these these are Sam Edelman and
their size 4 they're just these we what
it won't you even call this like cage
sandal that laces up in the front
I love the mirrored heel how freaking
cool is that they're just super
comfortable they fit perfectly I'm all
about these shoes next I went to a
Victoria's Secret my V TMI but I wanted
like a really good push-up bra like I
feel like I don't have a good push-up
bra and you know when you
asure just wish the girls looked a
little better so I got this one and I
actually don't normally like these kind
of backs like I usually just go for like
super basic bras okay how much showing
this it has this super strappy back and
I feel like this looks kind of like a
swimsuit it basically has a front
closure so you get more push up action
going on the very sexy push-up that's
all it says on here when you spend sixty
five dollars you get a free beanie and
scarf thing so I just bought these
underwear not super exciting they're
like the no-show kind and then you get a
free beanie and scarf which is actually
really nice like I really like this
this set is $40 alone if you buy it by
itself well I'm so excited for winter
okay so then I went to Old Navy I was
actually at that model to get something
for work and we somehow ended up in Old
Navy so the first thing I got is this
jean jacket kind of t-shirt super loose
button-down I know how I don't have one
of these yet but I just love the way
this looks with black ripped jeans
really nice this is a size extra small
and it was 2494 2494 that's random but
they were having like an entire store
20% off kind of thing I just got another
one of my camis from there I love Old
Navy camis they're $6 and they're
freaking amazing
I know it's normally twelve twelve fifty
but it was on sale for six dollars
material of these is just so nice I've
had my other ones for like a year now
and they're still going strong so if you
want good cheap camis good old Navy so I
got one that I think from Nordstrom so
by the time this videos up I'll probably
already be back or I'll be in Ohio right
now but I'm going to Boston Chicago and
Ohio and in Ohio I'm staying with my
friend and got her these as a little
thanks for having me present because it
oh let's do that I think these are
donuts I got these from Nordstrom and
they're like doughnut thank-you cards
how exciting is that I think this is the
last thing yeah I feel like I had a lot
more ok so last thing I got was actually
from Vancouver and the street we're
staying on Granville Street interesting
place our hostel was on Granville Street
and there was a store right next door I
forget what it was called but the brand
is the Vero Moda this is just a tank top
and I loved the pattern thing on this it
reminds me of like marble and watercolor
mixed I thought this would look really
you either to work with like a blazer or
just with a leather jacket everything's
with a leather jacket and this is super
affordable is one of those stores that
looked like it's gonna be a super
expensive boutique and then somehow
everything was like under $20 we did
film footage in Vancouver so I'm gonna
be having a Vancouver vlog coming soon
fun fact I actually dread editing vlogs
because there's so much friggin footage
to go through so my vlogs go up at
random times so that was everything yeah
if you guys like this video and you want
to see more all videos give it a thumbs
up so I know again I'll link the makeup
that I'm wearing right now down below
love you guys thanks for watching and
see you my next video fight you can't
move in this chair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
