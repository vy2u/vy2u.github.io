about it
all right so today we have another huge
fall home somebody's clothes that I
found I feel like you're gonna be my new
kind of staples when I was in New York
which I just posted the New York vlog so
I'm gonna link that over things over
here I always do that wrong obviously
went shopping when I was in New York
some of the stuff I bought before some
was from New York so my war in New York
so the first thing is from ASOS and I
ordered these online if you are more on
the petite side you know that it is
extremely hard to find those kind of
ankle legging jeans there are always
long I am super short I'm 411 and a half
so any kind of ankle jeans are always
extremely long on me I always have to
cut them and roll them up and these were
the first pair of leather leggings
leather ish these are faux leather
obviously they actually are tight around
the ankles and are short enough where I
can wear gold boots with them it has
this really nice elastic waist so it
kind of feels like you're wearing yoga
pants but the really leather this with a
white sweater and boots and red lipstick
I'm just feeling for full house in New
York I got a couple of things from hmm
the first is this like silky kind of
cami thing I'm not usually a fan of tan
I usually hate tan tan walls I cannot
stand but for some reason I really liked
this one I love the straps I love this
lace detail right here and this was a
freaking score this was normally this
camera literally closes off every 10
minutes because it's overheats don't
remember where we left off but I'm
pretty sure it was this tank top let's
move on so next thing I got a hmm was
this flannel dress clearly just like a
long semi see-through actually now that
I'm looking at it in the light flannel I
love the colors I'm into dark blues and
emeralds right now flannels on me are
usually kind of big in the shoulders and
can make me look like bulkier I really
like this one because it fits perfectly
on the top and then it just kind of
flows down it looks really flattering
this with tights and boots or just with
like a leather jacket I feel like will
look really cute it's a nice light
weight flannel it's not like the one I'm
wearing right now this is more of like a
dress shirt II kind of material from
Victoria's Secret I picked up one of
these bralette things I love these
things I have a black one
a white one that I've worn nose gray the
lace bralette from Victoria Secret
whenever I wear it in videos you guys
always ask about it I usually wear it
with like a tank top so you can see the
lace coming out on the top all of my bra
let's are from Victoria's Secret because
I love that they have the under cup and
padding in them I have more of a small
chest and when I wear bra let's it just
looks weird so they just came out with
this new pattern these straps are
thicker than the ones I have but I love
this camel color I think this will look
really cute with the tank top so in New
York I went to the Uniqlo flagship store
I really like uniquely I love their
stuff they are really good basic simple
pieces which is kind of what I'm all
about
usually the only kind of like pattern or
color I wear is a flannel but I got this
sweater from Uniqlo it's super thin I
feel like this will be a good
Thanksgiving fall kind of sweater got it
in a size medium so that it's a little
bit bag here belt ly this is a unique
color it's not quite pumpkin but it's
not brick you know I'm saying okay this
is my favorite thing that I've bought in
a while this is a jacket from Uniqlo and
this is the softest thing I've ever felt
in my life
again feeling the dark blue and like
jewel tones I got a good size extra
small because I like that it kind of
fits tight I feel like this with jeans
and boots will just be super comfortable
when it starts getting cooler it zips up
they had a bunch of different colors of
this and it was only 30 bucks which I
feel like is a good deal because North
Face makes one exactly like this and
guarantee you there's a not 30 bucks
I ordered a few things off of forever 21
mostly because I've been stocking this
one shirt and it finally came back in
stock I think this is my favorite thing
I've ever found out forever 21 and this
is one of those pieces that just feels
like way better quality than forever 21
I'm actually kind of shocked it actually
looks like it's pretty well made in just
the material of it is really nice it is
this lace up crop top kind of situation
okay how cool this detail is it laces
all the way down I don't know how I'm
gonna wear this yet but I saw this and I
literally have been refreshing the page
every day waiting for it to come back in
stock finally came back in stock I got
the shade the shade I got the size small
and it was 2290 it just feels like
really
nice more thick material love the black
and gold then I got this scar from
forever21 it was 990 love this mustard
color for fall with like a deep red lip
leather jacket I feel like you can wear
a leather jacket with anything and it
makes outfit look 50 times better I
don't know if I'm keeping this one or
returning it I think it's cute I just
don't really know what I bought this is
this like beaded dress
I literally just bought a beaded dress
that I told myself I was wearing on New
Year's that you guys saw in the last
fall hull Tryon video but I think this
is really cute and I really like this
detail I just don't know what I'm gonna
wear this
I should probably return this this was
2790 from forever 21 I got a few
accessories from there the first is this
black choker I've been really into
chokers lately and forever 21 has super
good cheap chokers this was only 490 and
it's like felt and then it has these
little school are you silver gold
probably turn their silver I just
thought this will look good layered with
like a gold necklace or something this
one I just thought was super unique I
don't want to wear this in the look
where I do like a black lip and then
like silver eye or something I don't
know I just really like this choker has
purple ish Lila is like lilac I guess
velvet and it was 790 and I had these
little rhinestone tea things I don't
even know how I came across this but I
feel like I haven't heard anyone talk
about this yet this is the rainbow
highlighter but it's from forever 21 and
it was only five ninety if you guys are
on Instagram or YouTube you know that
the whole rainbow highlight thing blew
up one girl and Etsy made this rainbow
highlighter that completely like went
viral and now forever 21 has come out
with their own version so I kind of want
to buy hers if it's still in stock and
then do like a comparison to see if it's
similar to this forever 21 one or I
might just use this as much mousse I
don't know but I thought this was really
cool also got this kind of mauve nail
polish from forever 21 it was 390 it
just says shade pink so I don't know but
this is their gel look nail polish I
haven't tried to see that not sure how
the formulas but I feel like this is a
perfect 90 is kind of a fall color I
picked up one thing from Nordstrom Rack
and it's this tank top by the brand
socialite and it
a velvet and black lace kind of cami
tank top feels like really nice quality
like the velvet feels pretty thick I
just thought for going out or whatever
this is a cute top
Velvets coming back and I'm not sad
about it and this was 2197 from
Nordstrom Rack another dress that I
definitely didn't need and I don't know
where I'm gonna wear it was this dress
from Ross it looks kind of cheap when
you see it here but these kind of
dresses where they're like flowy on the
top and then they're tight it's probably
a name for that I don't know what it is
though these dresses are just super
flattering on me it has this kind of
crossover thing in the front and it fits
me literally perfectly around the waist
and button everything I felt like it fit
so well that I couldn't say no I might
do like a prom or winter formal kind of
makeup look wearing this dress and do
like a sparkly rose bowl die or
something I don't know don't ask me why
I bought this but this was from Ross and
it was 26 99 which I feel like it's kind
of pricey for Ross also from Roth's oh
no this is from TJ Maxx this was a score
I feel like this is a super heavy like
this literally weighs 10 pounds chunky
cable knit sweater it has these
button-up things on the front and it was
1699 from TJ Maxx it's pretty long so I
feel like with leggings this will look
really cute it's just one of those
sweaters it feels like really nice
quality because it's so heavy
also at t.j.maxx I ended up finding Kat
Von D like what the heck they also had
Anastasia Beverly Hills contour palette
it was just in the darker shade so if
you're in the seattle area go to the TJ
maxx by Northgate because they had a ton
of good makeup they also had bare
minerals but I just picked up this Kat
Von D blush I haven't tried her blushes
yet it was only $6.99 also from TJ Maxx
I picked up a few greeting cards I'm
like one of those psycho people who just
stock up on greeting cards so that when
a birthday or something actually comes
along I don't have to go out and buy one
I already have a bunch of cute cards
waiting to use so anyone else do that
cards make me really happy and I feel
like sending mail is like a totally lost
art so I personally really like to send
people cards I got this one that says
you are so sweet and it's a pineapple
and I don't think it's even picking up
on camera but it's like metallic super
cute this is only 199
I got this celebrate one which is really
cute it has confetti on it that doesn't
move apparently this is like glittery
pink writing that's camera sucks I don't
know why people like this mea 5100
drives me crazy personally then I got
this thinking of you card it has like
flower wreath some glitter and then as
gold-foiled riding on it super cute
$1.99 also and inside on all these is
blink which is nice the last clothing
item are these leggings which I'm still
not sure if I'm keeping or returning
because honestly I feel like they were
super overpriced these are from Express
and they were 40 bucks so I ordered
these online and I was expecting them to
be like thick yoga pant material but
they're actually full-on leggings and
it's like a fleece so they will be warm
and they feel really soft and I like the
light gray shade but I don't know if
they're worth 40 bucks I feel like I
could find this at Target for like 15
the last thing I want to mention which I
recently got right before New York I'm
in love with it I am NOT a bag designer
person clearly like all of my clothes is
from Ross and stuff but this was one of
those bags I just really liked the
design of it and functionality so I
decided to splurge and get it and this
is the Henri Bendel mini jet setter bag
I've gotten a ton of questions from you
guys about this on Instagram and
snapchat
it's the bag that I brought to New York
I love it I think it's perfect you can
convert it into a backpack right here
you just clip the straps on these two
things I actually ordered a different
strap off of Amazon this leather shot
because it comes with like a canvas one
and I just like the look of leather
better if you're more petite the mini
size is awesome it's really hard to find
bags that don't look like overpowering
on my body and if you're taller or
whatever they make the normal jet setter
which is bigger or if you're like a
student or something you can fit your
laptop and books and stuff in it it's
pretty big let me know if you guys would
want to see what's in my bag video I
kind of want to do one because I
literally have never done what's in my
bag video so let me know down below if
you want to see that so that was
everything I hope you guys like this
video if you did make sure you give it a
thumbs up so I know if you're new here
you can join the burrito family by
subscribing love you guys thanks for
watching see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
