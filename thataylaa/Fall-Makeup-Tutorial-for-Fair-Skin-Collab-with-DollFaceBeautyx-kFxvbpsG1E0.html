this fall inspired drugstore look for
you guys for people with fair skin
specifically it can be easily adapted to
any skin tone this is a clap look I'm
doing clap with Dollface Beauty X
channel link will be down below she is
doing it for dark skin she's awesome go
check out her channel she's real I like
her so check out her channels down below
and then we can all have a good time I
realize this is my first talk-through
tutorial I think I've done since I
started YouTube I kind of like it I
don't know let me know how you guys like
it let's get the show on the road I'm so
freakin early right got my coffee I
think we're ready to go alright so like
I said we are going to be using all
aren't necessarily drugstore products
but products that you can find for very
cheap so like always you got to start
out with the primer it just makes your
eyeshadows look 5 million times better
this isn't technically a primer but this
is the one that I use almost every day
this is the Maybelline Color tattoo
24-hour eyeshadow in barely beige and
this was limited edition but you can
find very similar color I just like to
use my finger and just go on in there
I'm gonna be using two different
eyeshadow palettes for this look the
first one is by Maybelline it's the
expert wear eyeshadow in sun-baked
neutrals and this is honestly one of my
favorite palettes from a drugstore it
just has really pretty colors and you
can make it more dramatic whatever you
want so we're just gonna take a big
fluffy blending brush and this is the
e-40 by Sigma the link will be down
below so on my favorite brushes or just
taking this shade right here it's kind
of like a medium brown color and then
we're just placing this in the crease to
just define your eyes and you will
already see such a big difference in how
your eye looks it just really brings it
out and defines it I think we're going
to take the la color stargaze palette
this isn't at the drugstore actually it
might be at the drugstore now I will put
a link down below for where I found it
but it's literally the whole palette is
like two dollars so super inexpensive
always are really pigmented
I love it so first we are going to take
Goldy shade right at the end and
honestly it just applies best with your
finger so I'm just taking my finger and
we're gonna Pat it start to Pat it on
the outer third of your eye and look how
pigmented and gorgeous that is I hope
this color is showing up how it is in
real life I'm going to be using this
pinky shade right here we're gonna put
this right in this little area I'm using
my finger again I have cleaned it off
with a makeup remover wipe and I'm
blending it into that copper color and
look at how gorgeous this color is I
think on fair skin tones these kind of
like pinky copper shades just look
absolutely gorgeous and so next I'm
going to be going back to the Mabley
palette and I'm just taking the very
lightest shade and we're gonna put this
in our inner tear-duct
and I'm using just an elf sea shader
brush this is just gonna help to
brighten up that look and just kind of
blend it into that Goldy color but you
don't want to cover it then to define
the crease a little more we're gonna be
taking this dark red color up here and
I'm just using the elf defining blending
I brush we're taking a little bit of
that and we're just going to work it in
the outer V and into the crease a little
bit you don't want to get too far up in
the crease we're just focusing this on
the outside since it is a dark berry
shade so again just focusing this on the
outer outer V alright so then we're just
going to go back in with an empty empty
ending brush without product on that
again this is a sigma e40 I'm just gonna
blend it out so we don't have any harsh
lines or anything like that because who
wants that I do want this look to be a
little bit more defined so I'm gonna be
taking the L'Oreal infallible valuable
bottomless Java and this is just a rich
warm brown shade that is absolutely
gorgeous so pigmented love it and I'm
just going to be taking a card just to
make that edge a little bit more defined
now we have that sort of harsh line
which is gonna look great when we have
some lashes on looks kind of strange
right now but it it'll pull together
don't you worry all right then I'm just
gonna take that blending brush again and
just lightly lightly blend it out since
we are going to have a pretty dang bold
lip going I think I'm just going to use
a brown oh this isn't a drugstore shoot
so I'm using the covergirl liquid line
blast and this is just in the dark brown
shade and I'm just going to run this
along the outsides of my eyes really
close to the lash line
I don't like putting really dark
eyeliner on my waterline on the bottom
so I'm just going to be using this NYX
jumbo eye pencil and this is in cottage
cheese if you want a little bit more
crazy look you can use milk but this is
gonna be like a subtle brightening
effect as you can see it just kind of
makes you look more awake which we all
need alright so I'm going to apply a
single coat of mascara before I put on
the falsies so I'll be back after that
is done
alright the eyelashes I'm going to be
playing will be listed down below
because I'm not quite sure what they're
called right now I'm just going to go
ahead and apply my false lashes and I
will be right back after these bad boys
are eyes so now that we have our falsies
on our eyes are just looking so much
better so now I'm going to just apply my
bottom mascara I'm using the Maybelline
falsies
and I'm just going to put a single coat
of this on the bottom lashes okay so now
our eyes are complete I'm going to be
doing the rest of my face now and lips
so for kind of a blush bronzer I'm going
to be using Nyx's or raisin and it's
this really pretty warm brown purpley
shade and I'm going to be using my ELF
complexion brush and put this on
I think this shade is absolutely
gorgeous on fair skin tones it works
really well and you know what this
lighting isn't even showing it up true
to color so that's a bit of a shame
still feel like I need to do a little
bit of contouring so I'm going to be
taking a bronzer take any bronzer you
have others drugstore whatever the only
bronzer that I have at the moment is my
Sephora bronzer so I'm using that
since I don't have a drugstore
highlighter I'm actually just going to
be taking one of the eyeshadows from the
Maybelline quad and this is a good trick
if you don't want to spend money on a
highlighter or you don't have one
whatever you can just take like a light
shimmery white champagne color and I'm
going to be using this one right here
we're just gonna put plop that down the
bridge of our nose both your Cupid's bow
and then I'm gonna put it a little bit
on the tops of my cheeks just to give it
a little bit of dimension you know what
I'm saying
I posted a picture on Instagram of this
lip look and people were like flipping
out about it my Instagram is the same as
my youtube name if you want to follow me
I think I'm just going to recreate that
lip look because it was a success looks
really good for fall the dark reds and
purple tones are really in this fall and
I'm loving it so I'm going to be using
three different lip products we have
here the first one unfortunately this is
a lip liner it's nitro brand it says
it's Canadian I got it in Jordan I don't
know it's just the perfect dark color
and this was like equivalent like one
dollar and it's really good actually the
second thing I'm going to be using is
the wet wild lipstick in no.8 C it's a
dark purple e shade and then the third
thing or El Peris lip color black in the
shade is Lac on it we're just going to
start out with this lip liner and line
the lips
okay I'm not going to line my lips fully
because we do want that ombre effect max
I'm going to be taking the lipstick
where did I just put it this guy look at
that you gotta love it then for the
inner part of our lip we're using the
Loreal shade and these are freakin
amazing I have a first impressions video
on these if you would like to see them I
will link it below and since it is an
ombre lip we're just placing this in the
very center and then gonna kind of blend
it up alright so this is the finished
