Cheers
so today we're talking about my favorite
lipsticks for summer all of mine were
drugstore it's just the way it worked
out I don't really go with the whole
vampy lips in winter and like pink lips
in summer I just think you should wear
whatever you feel like wearing if you
like wearing blue lips just wear but
these are some pics that I think most
people would go for for summer couple
these are brand new products that I
haven't mentioned before a couple you've
heard about so let's do it this is a
collab with my friend Bailey here on
YouTube her YouTube channel will be
linked down below and definitely go
check out her video and subscribe to our
channel because she's a super talented
makeup artist she does a really awesome
theater makeup every time I look at her
Instagram I'm just like in awe she's
also a pale princess so if you watch my
videos to get tips on makeup for
fair-skinned you would also love her
channel and girl made it to the top 20
and NYX face awards so super happy for
her be sure to go vote for her and check
out her next face rewards video thanks
dad so she also did her favorite
lipsticks for summer so be sure to go
check those out down below so the first
two products I'm gonna mention are by la
girl these are the brand new glazed lip
paints they look exactly like the Too
Faced melted packaging to me I think
that's kind of what they were going for
I have all six shades and I will have a
whole review coming soon but these are
my two favorite shades I'll swatch them
for you guys you can see how pigmented
these are this is really difficult to
swatch look at that crazy intense color
only downside with these is that the
applicator is so big that it's really
difficult to get in the lines of your
lips so I usually use a lip brush or
something like that to apply it I'll
link the lip brush I use down below but
this one's in the shade babydoll and
then this purple one is in the shade koi
I'm obsessed with purple lips what you
know if you watch my channel there we go
so pigmented so beautiful also forgot to
mention if you want to see a get ready
with me shadow in shmooze video on the
look I'm wearing right now it'll be up
after this video and you can see how I
did
this look I just got lip gloss all over
my hand
gotta love wipes next one I'm gonna
mention is this Milani lip intense
liquid color and this is in the shade of
pink rave if you follow my Instagram
you've seen me wearing this but it has
this really nice purple undertone to it
but it's not too crazy intense I think
it's super wearable so look at that just
insane color I also love the packaging
of this I love gold it's all about the
gold my next pick is the Wet n Wild
Fergie lipstick in old-school glam if
you didn't like the formula of the
original Wet n Wild lipsticks try this
one because they completely reformulated
it it's so much nicer so much creamier
and not drying like the other ones where
and this is just like the perfect kind
of bright summer
Coralie Reddy's are super affordable
again like three to five dollars
depending on where you get it hands
starting to turn pink on there's hair
the next one is this Maybelline lipstick
and this is in the shade 8:40 coral
lustre I hope this isn't limited edition
I got this a while ago I'll look it up
and I'll put the info down below you
could probably still find it on Amazon
or something like that but this is just
a really pretty kind of lighter coral
color this is definitely a more wearable
coral and it's buildable so there's one
swipe and then you can see when I
layered it get a little bit more color
packaging of this is so cool it's like
an iridescent purpley silvery kind of
thing the next one is also another
Maybelline lipstick and this is from the
vivid line and this is 875 vivid rose I
just think this would be really pretty
with like some BB cream and blush and
mascara and then just throw this on next
I have L'Oreal LeMat in she's so mad I
wore this in a few of my older videos my
how to paint furniture video I also have
a whole first impressions video on all
of these super old filmed it in a hotel
room a little bit janky but if you want
to see my thoughts on these then you can
watch that video this is just a great
matte red shade that definitely has a
little bit of coral in there it looks
completely different on the lips than it
does on my hand last one which I had to
mention because this is one of my Holy
Grail lip products for all year round
but especially I feel like this
be great for summer this is the essence
gel tint I'll swatch it for you guys I
don't know how much you're gonna be able
to tell because it is a gel tint oh we
can actually really tell so this is a
water-based gelatin it's not
long-lasting I do find that I have to
apply this every few hours when I wear
it I just love the look that this gives
your lips it looks like you just ate a
popsicle it's not too much it's not an
overpowering red I think this would be
great for summer just to throw on your
lips but it doesn't look like you tried
too hard or wearing a ton of makeup
this is what I reach for pretty much
every day so those are my lipstick picks
for summer comment down below with what
your guys's favorite lipsticks are for
summer because I want to know and I like
I need more makeup be sure to go check
out Bailey's video and see what she
picked out sure she's got some good ones
love you guys thanks for watching see
you in my next video bye you're like I
have to sneeze come on not coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
