Cheers so today we're talking about my
favorite lipsticks for summer all of
mine were drug store it's just the way
it worked out I don't really go with the
whole vampy lips in winter and like pink
lips and summer I just think you should
wear whatever you feel like wearing if
you like wearing blue lips just wear but
these are some pics that I think most
people would go for for summer couple
these are brand new products that i
haven't mentioned before a couple you've
heard about so let's do it this is a
collab with my friend Bailey here on
YouTube her YouTube channel will be
linked down below and definitely go
check out her video and subscribe to our
channel because she is a super talented
makeup artists she does a really awesome
Theater makeup every time I look at her
Instagram I'm just like in awe she's
also a pale princess so if you watch my
videos to get tips on makeup for fair
skin you would also love her channel and
girl made it to the top 20 and NYX face
awards so super happy for her be sure to
go vote for her and check out her next
face rewards video thanks dad so she
also did her favorite lipsticks for
summer so be sure to go check those out
down below so the first two products i'm
going to mention our by la girl these
are the brand new glazed lip paints they
look exactly like the two face melted
packaging to me i think that's kind of
what they were going for i have all six
shades and i will have a whole review
coming soon but these are my two
favorite shades I'll swatch them for you
guys you can see how pigmented these are
this is really difficult to swatch look
at that crazy intense color only
downside with these is that the
applicator is so big that it's really
difficult to get in the lines of your
lips so I usually use a lip brush or
something like that to apply it I'll
link the lip brush I use down below but
this one's in the shade baby doll and
then this purple one is in the shade coy
I'm obsessed with purple lips what you
know if you watch my channel there we go
so pigmented so beautiful also forgot to
mention if you want to see a get ready
with me shadow and schmooze video on the
look I'm wearing right now it'll be up
after this video and you
can see how I did this look I just got
lip gloss all over a hand gotta love
wipes next one I'm going to mention is
this Milani lip intense liquid color and
this is in the shade of pink rave if you
follow my Instagram you've seen me
wearing this but it has this really nice
purple undertone to it but it's not too
crazy intense I think it's super
wearable so look at that just insane
color I also love the packaging of this
I love gold all about the gold my next
pick is the wet and wild fergie lipstick
in old-school glam if you didn't like
the formula of the original wet and wild
lipsticks try this one because they
completely reformulated it it's so much
nicer so much creamier and not drying
like the other ones were and this is
just like the perfect kind of bright
summer coralie reddy's are super
affordable again like three to five
dollars depending on where you get it
hands starting to turn pink on there's
hair the next one is this Maybelline
lipstick and this is in the shade 840
coral luster I hope this isn't limited
edition i got this a while ago I'll look
it up and I'll put the info down below
you could probably still find it on
Amazon or something like that but this
is just a really pretty kind of lighter
coral color this is definitely a more
wearable coral and it's buildable so
there's one swipe and then you can see
when I layered it get a little bit more
color packaging of this is so cool it's
like an iridescent purple e silvery kind
of thing next one is also another
Maybelline lipstick and this is from the
vivid line and this is 875 vivid rose I
just think this would be really pretty
with like some BB cream and blush and
mascara and then just throw this on next
I have L'Oreal LeMat in she so Matt I
wore this in a few of my older videos my
how to paint furniture video they also
have a whole first impressions video on
all of these super old filmed it in a
hotel room a little bit janky but if you
want to see my thoughts on these then
you can watch that video this is just a
great matte red shade that definitely
has a little bit of coral in there it
looks completely different on the lips
than it does on my hand last one which I
had to mention because
this is one of my Holy Grail lip
products for all year round but
especially I feel like this would be
great for summer this is the essence gel
tint I'll swatch it for you guys I don't
know how much you're going to be able to
tell because it is a gel tint oh you can
actually really tale so this is a
water-based gelatin it's not
long-lasting I do find that I have to
apply this every few hours when I wear
it I just love the look that this gives
your lips it looks like you just ate a
popsicle it's not too much it's not an
overpowering red I think this would be
great for summer just to throw on your
lips but it doesn't look like you tried
too hard or wearing a ton of makeup
this is what I reach for pretty much
every day so those are my lipstick picks
for summer comment down below with what
your guys's favorite lipsticks are for
summer because I want to know and I like
I need more makeup be sure to go check
out Bailey's video and see what she
picked out sure she's got some good ones
