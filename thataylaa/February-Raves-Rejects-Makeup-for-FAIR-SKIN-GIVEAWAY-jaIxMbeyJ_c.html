this month so brace yourselves
is anyone else extremely confused as to
how it's already March I still have my
Christmas tree up so today we have a
favorites video current favorites
February favorites whatever you want to
call it probably the most random
selection of favorites I've ever had I'm
playing around with the light for about
20 minutes so I hope it's doable comment
down below and let me know if you like
this background better or my normal
background better I really like white
backgrounds very OCD with lighting and
backgrounds so let me know down below
what you like there is going to be a
giveaway at the end of this video so
stay tuned for that let's just jump
right into it
the first favorite is my toothpaste
which is upside down this is the crest
3d white glamorous white toothpaste I
think they have two or three different
kinds of the 3d white I think they all
work the same I used to always get
compliments on my white teeth and I
realized they stopped happening that is
probably a sign that I need to start
whitening my teeth again I drink a
ton of coffee we're talking three to
five cups a day
don't judge coffee and red wine both
which I really are like my two loves in
this world both horribly stained your
teeth so I went on a teeth whitening
mission and if you saw my tweets you
know that I used the crest 3d white
strips which was an experience from hell
for me they gave me the most painful
like tooth sensitivity I've ever had I
couldn't breathe in without it being
painful other people on Twitter said it
happened to them so that was really
weird
so I went with something a little more
friendly for people with sensitive teeth
I swear to god this has actually
whitened my teeth you can see a
noticeable difference when you just use
this toothpaste in my teeth look white
to you hey better I don't think I've
ever put fashion favorites in my raves
and rejects videos and I think that's
because I never really have a piece that
I'm like obsessed with but this month
let me tell you that happened so I got
this skirt from romwe and it is just a
red
skater skirt but ladies and gentlemen it
is not just a normal red skater skirt it
looks so flattering on the body hugs me
in all the right places
it's fantastic if they had it in other
colors I would buy it in every color I'm
going to check and see if they have it
in black because I really do like this
bling for this will be down below if
you're interested romwe has some really
freaking unique pieces and it gets tough
every day so that's like part of my
routine oh when I wake up a like checker
wrongly shopping online addict
the next favorite which is gonna be in
my video for fair skinned people which
is coming soon is the Ben Nye luxury
powder in cameo if you watch youtube
videos you have probably heard the Ben
Nye banana powder talked about if you've
got fair skin like I'm talking NW 25 NW
20 and below you do not want to be
putting banana powder on your face
girlfriend you're gonna look like a
banana that is made for all of skin
tones and more dark skin tones if you
have a fair complexion you want to use
the shade and cameo in love I got this
off of ebay you can also get it off the
Ben Nye website I believe I want to say
it was about 10 to 13 dollars you can
also get the bigger size if you're going
to town while we're on the face products
we might as well just go with another
one this is the physician oh my god I
just realized there's a rainbow brush
down here it's like a scavenger hunt oh
my god come to mama not that I would
ever use this brush on my face but I'm a
free mitt holy balls anyways the actual
product is Physicians Formula mineral
weary talc free correcting powder in
translucent first of all this is not
translucent it has pretty good coverage
second of all if you have fair skin
please go buy this right now if you
follow me on Instagram you might be like
didn't she just discover this like two
days ago
yes and I feel the need to mention it
because it is that amazing it is super
light you can see right there looks like
I'm flipping you off right now you guys
know I love the other powder foundation
by Physicians Formula but it is too dark
for me even the lightest shade so this
has been a lifesaver marry me the next
rave for the month
is max prep and prime mascara primer
when I first started using this I didn't
see a huge difference I've been using
this for about two months now and over
time I definitely see a difference in my
lashes they feel fuller I can't put on a
mascara anymore without this stuff
basically a white mascara primer you put
this on your lashes before your normal
mascara I usually let it sit for about
30 seconds and then I apply my L'Oreal
carbon luminous wrong order
incredible for the lashes my next
favorite is my bra if you saw my last
video then you know I am obsessed with
my true and Cobra I ordered two more if
you have brush struggles struggles
finding a bra that actually fits your
girls then you want to click right here
my last rave of the month is morphe
brushes eyeshadows actually discovered
them myself from Instagram and I ended
up purchasing five of their eyeshadow
pans which are two dollars each and
freaking incredible and so pigmented and
I don't know what you're doing if you
don't have them and then they saw how
much I love them and they sent me a
palette to try out I used it for one of
my tutorials I will link it right here
this is the palette that they sent me it
has some super crazy fun colors and also
some really good neutral colors you have
a couple blocks down here a matte black
some really good basic colors and then
you can also throw on like a pop of
color if you're feeling so inclined for
the giveaway you can win this morphe
shadow palette brand new not this one
obviously how to enter this giveaway is
super simple you have to be a subscriber
give this video a thumbs up and then
head over to my Twitter and follow me on
Twitter that is it the only reject I
have this month is the elf studio pink
pink diamonds blush this is probably the
shittiest blush I've ever tried in my
life literally nothing comes off of it
done so thanks for watching have fun

ever in your favor
