review on the new color switch duo by
Vera Mona this is the freaking talk of
the town on Instagram people if you
follow any makeup artist or beauty
bloggers on Instagram you have probably
seen this anything that makes you not
have to clean your brushes sign me up
so this is basically a product that is
supposed to make it in between colors
when you're doing makeup way easier it's
supposed to remove all of the product on
the brushes and you'll see in the demo
how that works so the color switch duo
which is what this is retails for $19.99
on their website and then you can get
the color switch solo which is 1699 so
basically it has this section right here
which reminds me of like a hair donut
and this is where it's supposed to
remove the color and then the inner
portion you can wet and it's like a
little sponge and it's supposed to make
your eyeshadows more pigmented I really
like the packaging of it it's super
light easy to carry around if you're
going to events or doing makeup or
whatever and look at the patterns really
cute on the back of this it says to
clean this sponge all you do is remove
it and you can wash it with a fragrance
free soap and warm water lay it flat to
dry these you can only use once I
believe they have refills on their
website that you can also purchase there
so let's just see the demo and see how
this thing works
so the shadow I'm going to be using is
more freshers shadow these are super
pigmented so I think it'll be a good
test let's start out with this magenta
because I know it's incredibly pigmented
here it is we're gonna pretend like we
applied it to someone's eye and wiping
it off on a paper towel it is still
completely pink then we're gonna go in
with the color switch and the texture of
this reminds me exactly of like a hair
donut it's like super coarse and spongy
I'm just moving this around alright so
let's see if there's absolutely zero
color coming off on my arm these
bristles just stain I'm gonna try it
with another brush just to show you guys
this is the brush I'm going to be using
it's just a flat shader brush and let's
go in with blue why not so here's the
product on the brush and wipe it off on
a paper towel
just like we're using it on someone's
eye
so here it is completely still blue
let's watch it still coming off and that
one took it off super fast it's
completely completely gone so crazy so
that was my first impression on the
color switch I feel like this is like a
miracle product if you're a makeup
artist or if you just do like really
bold looks and you have to switch
between colors frequently if you have
tried this out let me know how you like
it
