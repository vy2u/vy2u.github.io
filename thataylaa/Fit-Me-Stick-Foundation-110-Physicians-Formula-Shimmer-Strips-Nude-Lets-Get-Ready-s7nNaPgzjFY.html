together and it's going to be fun
so this is kind of to show you how I
wear these two new products that I've
been lovin the first is the Maybelline
fit me stick Foundation and the second
is the Physicians Formula warm nude
shimmer brick which you can use any eyes
or I can use on your face we're going
all out and I'm going to show you how to
use them on both so here's the fit me
stick foundation that I'm also going to
be using today so the reason I like this
foundation if you're a pale princess
like me this will be perfect for you you
can see how light it is and I actually
like blending out with a sigma f80
kabuki brush it's supposed to blend it
out with your fingers but I prefer a
brush eye thing because a more flawless
finish and now I'm using concealer for
under my eyes all the products listed
will be in the downbar
so be sure to check their I'm not going
to be naming all of them then I'm
setting it in with my Physicians Formula
translucent powder then for the rest of
my face since it's a little bit darker
I'm using a physician's formula to help
free foundation both these powders have
been working wonders for me so now for
bronzer we're going in with the shimmer
brick and I'm using the darkest shades
on a bronzing brush for blush I'm taking
the pink shades in the shimmer brick and
I'm applying this with a morphe brush on
the apples of my cheeks I wear this in
Vegas and it gives you a super pretty
glow especially if you're going to be
taking pictures or anything like that
this is amazing
then to highlight I'm going to be taking
the lightest shade in the shimmer brick
which is like a shimmery white color
using this I'm just highlighting the
bridge of my nose and on top of my
cheekbone then I'm going to tame my
brows and then fill them in if you want
to see exactly how I fill in my brows
there's a whole brow routine you can
click right here it'll open a new window
so don't worry you won't get lost
I'm home from college right now and I
discovered a whole pile of makeup that I
didn't know I had so instead of Mac's
painterly Paint Pot to prime my eyes I'm
using Urban Decay's 24/7 glide-on shadow
pencil in the color sin and then we're
going in with elfs brick matte eye
shadow this is perfect for the crease it
reminds me of brown script by Mac so I'm
just blending that out with a fluffy
brush and then to make my lid color pop
a little bit more I'm using NYX jumbo
eye pencil and milk all over the lid for
the lid color I'm using this light
shimmery pink color you could pretty
much use any of the lighter shades you
wanted which is also why this thing is
awesome if you're going for an old old I
used like the champagne color that'd be
really pretty now we're taking the
darkest shade and just popping this in
the crease focusing mostly on the outer
third of my eye another thing that's
great about using these as eyeshadows is
since I also can be use on your face
they I think they designed them to be
pretty blendable I had no issues
blending these out and I really liked
the way it turned out so now I'm taking
the lightest shade and plopping that on
my inner corner and then I'm going in
with this Goldy color and putting this
on my bottom lashline bringing it pretty
much all the way into the inner corner
but I'm using my favorite liquid liner
in creating a slick wing I applied some
mascara and then for lips I'm using
Revlon's pink pout which is gorgeous
kind of muted pink color you can leave
it like that or you can apply a little
bit of gloss I'm just dabbing a little
bit on in the middle to make my lips
look bigger because who doesn't want
bigger lips this is the final look give
this video a thumbs up if you guys like
these kind of videos and here's me being
Italian for a second thanks for watching
love you guys see you in my next video
