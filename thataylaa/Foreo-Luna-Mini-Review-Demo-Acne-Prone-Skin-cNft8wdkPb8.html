mood so beauty guru alright so today we
are going to be talking about this guy
isn't he cute feel like he needs a name
but Luna mini by Freya this is a facial
cleansing tool it's made of all
silicones these are all silicone
bristles you don't have to change out a
brush head or anything like the
Clarisonic I mentioned a few videos but
I tried out the Clarisonic and it just
wasn't for me it's way too abrasive for
my skin I have super sensitive acne
prone skin I do get cystic acne from
time to time on my chin down here well
actually returning my Clarisonic and I'm
super excited I had a chance to try this
out have a few videos on my skin that go
in depth about my skin history I'll link
them down below I have an acne story
video and how I got rid of my cystic
acne layer down there so before we get
into the review this is sponsored by
feyo
thank you guys for working with me on
this video I've been trying this out for
a month and a half now all of my
thoughts are my own I only put my name
behind stuff that I stand behind with
that being said you can either X out or
keep on watching if you want to know my
thoughts on the foreo luna luna mini
life rail there we go it's a little set
that I have here is actually one of
their holiday sets it's a three piece
set it comes with the actual facial
cleansing tool and then two face washes
a day cleanser and a night cleanser and
get this set from Sephora it retails for
$139 and you get two hundred five
dollars worth of stuff in here so
starting out with the actual tool
I love how tiny and compact this is is
great for traveling it's fully
waterproof so you can use this in the
shower or you know if you're just a
messy face washer you don't have to
worry about water getting in here there
is a charger right here but you only
have to use it every once in a while
because it lasts 300 uses a full charge
the thing I really like about this is
that it's a hundred percent silicone
which means that bacteria isn't going to
build in here you don't have to replace
the heads the heads on the Clarisonic
are freaking expensive and if you don't
replace them frequently enough you're
basically just putting bacteria back
onto your face you just clean this by
using some antibacterial soap after I'm
done I'll just literally go like this
and like
a bit through I have small hands and
this is super easy to hold it has these
really tiny bristles at the bottom and
at the top of the tool it gets a little
bit bigger it has a few different
vibrations on here this is the first one
and this one is the most intense the
second one is a little bit lighter than
that that's what I would recommend using
when you're starting out and then
building it up to the first one either
one is super gentle on your skin I like
can't focus well this is like vibrating
in my ear
either one is super gentle on your skin
that's what I love about this is that
you're not gonna have to worry about
like over cleansing after I put a face
mask on I like to use this without the
vibrations on and just go in and scrub
off the face mask if you have any sit
there and like scrub off a clay mask and
so this just really helps to get it off
super fast they recommend using this in
the morning and at nighttime when I
first started I was just using this at
night and then kind of built it up to
twice a day it's up to you my skin is
just super sensitive and I wanted to see
how it reacted to it before I kept going
it makes your skin feel super soft but
not like stripped
yeah
all right so moving on to the cleansers
these are designed to be used together
with the Luna this day cleanser is more
of a moisturizing one and it smells
citrusy but not not overpowering yogurty
consistency if that makes sense like a
super creamy and moisturizing if you
have dry skin I feel like this would
work really well for you the night
cleanser is great if you're looking for
a super gentle exfoliator it has little
exfoliating beads in it but it's not
super harsh at all of you're sensitive
to smells you'll like these because they
have a faint scent but they're not too
much if you're looking for a good gift
for someone or you just want to save
some money if you're going to already
buy the Luna mini I would say go with
the gift set you might as well if you're
debating between this and the Clarisonic
my personal opinion is go for this the
Clarisonic was just way too harsh on my
skin feels like it's getting into your
pores and actually cleansing your skin
but it's not too harsh let me know what
you guys think of the luna mini down
below if you've tried it out if you guys
like this video and it was helpful for
you give it a thumbs up so I know love
you guys thanks for watching see ya my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
