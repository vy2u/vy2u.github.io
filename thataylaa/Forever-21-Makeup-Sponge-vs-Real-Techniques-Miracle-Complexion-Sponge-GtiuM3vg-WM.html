have a sponge smackdown I just put on a
moon necklace from the 80s some kind of
curious to see how a blue necklace from
the 80s still works in 2014 I've never
seen anyone talk about this sponge so I
decided to pick it up I originally was
just going to do a first impressions
video on the new forever 21 love and
beauty makeup sponge but as I was mid
demo I thought how interesting can one
sponge be so we're comparing it to the
Real Techniques miracle makeup sponge so
to give you a little bit of comparison
the forever 21 makeup sponge retails for
380 obviously at forever 21 they had a
few different colors but went with
purple the Real Techniques miracle
sponge retails for about six to seven
dollars depending on where you get it
then of course there is the Beauty
Blender which retails for about twenty
dollars twenty dollars for a freaking
sponge is a little reading the better be
made of gold or come with a Lamborghinis
all I'm saying so this whole makeup
sponge trend is supposed to be a way to
apply your makeup without getting
brushstrokes and have a flawless finish
and all of that good stuff I obviously
have used the Real Techniques sponge
before and I absolutely love it I've
been using this every single day for
about the past week since I got it and I
have never used this one before besides
in this video which you'll see in a
second this one is obviously I don't
even know what you would call this 3d
cone shaped and this one has some
interesting things going on it has this
flat surface right here which I usually
use and then if you want you could use
this part and use this point to like it
in your small crevices on your face the
forever 21 one is a lot denser this one
is a lot easier to squeeze this one
feels like a rock this one feels like a
sponge feel like that was that whole
video summarized into one sentence so
now I will lead you to a demo and you
can see how these sponges work in action
so this is the size of the makeup sponge
before we put it in some water I have my
cup ready to go okay so I tried to get
as much absorption of water in there as
I could it doesn't seem like it got that
much bigger did it I can't really tell
doesn't look to me like it got that much
bigger so the foundation I'm going to be
using is the maybelline superstay mixed
with my Manic Panic dreamtone foundation
you want to see a video on how I mix
these I have one and I will link it
right here as you can see definitely
just got enough foundation for 10 people
so just rub whatever was left over on my
finger from mixing the foundation on my
face and now we're going to go ahead and
just bounce this in the foundation and
let's see how it applies it feels super
hard kind of like I'm pressing a rock on
my face
it doesn't feel anything like the Real
Techniques one I feel like all the
product is just getting absorbed into
the sponge because I literally had a
 ton of foundation on my hand and
it's like 3/4 gone and I've only done
half of my face I mean as far as it
putting the product on my face it looks
evenly distributed on my face there's no
lines or sponge marks or anything like
that
I just feel like it literally absorbed
all of the foundation in here I'm going
to go ahead and use the Real Techniques
one on the other side of my face so you
guys can see kind of a difference if one
gives better coverage than the other one
or if this one absorbs less foundation
so as you can see with water this one is
a hell of a lot bigger using equal
pressure and this guy is obviously a
little more flexible let's just use the
rest of the foundation on my hand with
the Real Techniques sponge
this one just feels so much easier to
apply and definitely gives better
coverage you can see that side compared
to this side this that is the same exact
foundation everything this side you can
obviously see my freckles and acne scars
and this one has a lot better coverage
still enough foundation on my hand to do
the rest of my face
so you can see this side of my face
versus this side Real Techniques I'd
used a hell of a lot less foundation
literally had probably three times as
much foundation on my hand that I
normally use and the forever21 sponge
soaked up 3/4 of it for a couple dollars
more I obviously much prefer the Real
Techniques sponge I am NOT a fan of this
at all it soaked up way too much
foundation and I will probably be
throwing this away or saving it for my
April reason rejects video
I think this sponge is awesome in days
when I just don't feel like using a
brush or all my brushes are dirty I go
for the sponge and it's super easy to
use gives you a flawless finish
I'm obviously wearing it right now and I
love it if you liked this video and it
was helpful for you be sure to click the
thumbs up button so I know thanks for
watching love you guys see you in my
next video bye ratchet-ass here right
