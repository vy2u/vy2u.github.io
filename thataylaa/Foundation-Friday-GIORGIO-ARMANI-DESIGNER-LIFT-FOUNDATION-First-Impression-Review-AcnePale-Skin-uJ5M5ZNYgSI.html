Friday happy foundation Friday friends
I'm excited I hope you are
are we crooked I can't tell every single
Friday on my channel I do a new
foundation first impression video so I'm
gonna leave the playlist down below if
you've missed any foundation Friday's so
today I'm trying out a foundation that I
probably wouldn't have picked up if I
didn't do YouTube a bunch of you guys
requested to see this during 15 days of
foundation if you missed that and
relates a playlist down below and I
never got around to trying out this
foundation during that series so we're
doing it today this is a frickin
high-end pricey foundation which I try
not to judge products based on the price
point I like to just base my opinions on
the actual product itself there are
amazing drugstore products are amazing
high-end products obviously this is not
going to be in everyone's price point
and to be honest I probably wouldn't
pick this up if I wasn't reviewing this
for you guys just because I feel like
$67 for a foundation is just hard to
justify personally and I think I said
what it is this is the Giorgio Armani
designer lift smoothing firming
foundation has an SPF 20th purchase is
the first Giorgio Armani product I've
ever bought in my entire life you can
actually get samples of this if you go
to Bloomingdale's or Nordstrom's just
ask the ladies at the counter or the men
for a sample if you don't want to
splurge on it upfront and you just want
to try it out first just ask for a
sample as I was doing some research into
this foundation one thing that was
really interesting to me is that is
actually supposed to help heal your skin
I was reading through the reviews Ostrom
and a bunch of people said that actually
helped to heal their blemishes and acne
and I have cystic acne I've combination
skin and I usually break out a ton on my
chin area hormonal cystic acne so I kind
of think of this as like a two-in-one
skin care and foundation or that's how
I'm justifying the price point in my
head
restores up to ten years of luminosity
do I look fourteen firms lines up to 87%
and firm skin by 73% they have a lot of
very interesting wording on here the
Armani unique micro field technology
drapes the face with an ultra fine micro
lifting matrix you're just freaking lift
that's what you're doing high
concentration of exclusive emollients
and velvet filters that immediately
lifts often firm for more youthful skin
prex color irregular
is supposed to be weightless
full-coverage off the bad thing I don't
like about this is that they're only
eight shades high-end foundations
typically have a wider shade range
doesn't mean that they go super pale or
super dark but they typically have more
than eight shades they're luminous silk
foundation which I haven't tried let me
know if you guys would want to see that
one
but that foundation has way more shades
than the designer lift foundation I'm
not sure why that is you'll see when I
apply this how the shape goes on on my
skin but I really had to like blend this
down my neck to make this somewhat work
the lightest shade is very dark clear
pale this one isn't kind of work unless
you mix something in with it so it
really seems like this kind of catered
towards middle skin tones all right so
swatch time just for some comparison
this is the shade - the lightest shade
in the giorgio armani lifts foundation
this is Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless 110 Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
stick foundation in 115 Tarte rainforest
of the sea in the lightest shade if you
guys are excited for this video and you
like foundation Friday make sure you
give this a thumbs up you can always let
me know down below in the comments what
foundation you want to see for next week
so if you want to see my thoughts on the
Giorgio Armani designer lift foundation
you're in the right place just keep
watching all right we are here what time
is it where's my phone
it's 10:28 in the morning why is
everything left blue I think I'm gonna
get some new lighting I just have
nowhere to put it in my room I feel like
the background needs to be like brighter
or something in that you guys already
see the swatches I haven't swatch this
yet so I'm not sure how dark or light
this is going to be this packaging
though is glorious this is a glass
bottle pretty heavy like I don't know if
you want to be travel with this things
I'm going to shake this a little bit and
then pump this out and I did already
primed my face today use the jouer
anti blemish matte primer I think kind
of feeling this I've been reaching for
this a lot and by the way if you didn't
see last week's foundation Friday you
should go watch that because I've been
reaching for the covergirl BB cream a
 ton lately really like it whoa it's
pretty liquidy yeah super liquidy it
says it's full coverage so I'm going to
start with that amount about a quarter
sized amount and I do have a brush here
and a sponge
I'm gonna use my Sigma f80 on one side
of my face and then the Real Techniques
sponge on the other you're suppose
someone
with brush on the side of my face whoa
shade looks quite yellow and dark but
it's covering really well and it's going
pretty far like I'm spreading this to
the other side of my face now because I
have a ton of product smells kind of
like baby wipes / like grandma perfume
this is like bringing back childhood
memories of sitting in my mom's bathroom
and smelling old for makeup did anyone
else do that I think it smelled it more
than I actually put it on my face shade
wise know if you're a pale princess this
one is a definite no it's gonna be way
too dark I'm just going to majorly blend
this down my neck and hope that I can
make it not look orange after like leave
the house today so I'm going to attempt
to make this doable without a foundation
mixer just I don't want it to alter the
formula or anything but as far as the
foundation I really like how it went on
and how it's sitting on my face so I'm
to use a tiny bit since that went pretty
far for my forehead yeah little
definitely goes a long way
thank God because it's freaking pricey
this is looking really nice pretty dewy
I would say but it does feel like it's
setting on my face which I like feels
like I could go without a powder almost
yep I think I could doesn't feel like
the josie maran argan oil foundation
which I do love but that want to feel
like I definitely have to set this one
it's dewy but it is definitely setting
on my face so let's go in for this side
see how much this covers up with this
and this is the Real Techniques sponge I
only had a tiny bit of product left
we're still going off the original
amount I comes out and this is covering
really well for the amount of product it
just had left over a pump probably half
a pump out it's going to do the last of
my super prerecorded foundation Fridays
because when you're watching this I'm in
Mexico probably snapping and probably on
Instagram so you can follow along there
if you want to but let me know down
below which foundation you want to see
in next week's foundation Friday oh man
yeah shade is dark ladies and gents as
far as coverage looks about the same
for all the redness and stuff I had
going on right here it covered pretty
well doesn't look totally flawless full
coverage I'm going to go in and just
kind of DAB on areas where I need a
little bit more coverage to see if we
can get it totally full coverage I'm
going to use the brush for that because
typically that works better for me or
something I will use a sponge so I'm
doing a super thin second layer still
isn't totally full coverage but I kind
of like that because it covered
everything pretty much that I feel like
I need to cover but you can still see my
skin coming through you can still see
freckles still see some kind of marks on
my face it just what makes it look still
like skin but it's covering all the
things I want covered it looks like I
have a major tan it's not even showing
up on camera how dark it is in person
but it's pretty dark I'm gonna have to
do some major highlighting with
concealer alright so here's what the
foundation is looking like up close it
looks pretty good like it just looks
very skin-like to me really like the
finish of it it's pretty dewy so if you
don't like do you wouldn't like this but
it's just looking like skin so far I'm
liking it I might as well try this
concealer on camera this is amazing
cosmetics amazing concealer this is in
the shade I pray I also have the shade
fair but for some reason I think this
one might be lighter I don't know but
I'm using the shade ivory because it's
what I have right here concealer with
these nails is a little interesting I'm
acing my second finger right now I never
use it I don't know why this is just one
of those products that I've never tried
but that's been out for forever because
my face is so tan right now this is
looking extra light under there so I
actually leave for my vacation tomorrow
in my time I to just put more outfit end
on here play my time right now when I'm
filming this so tonight if you can do a
spray tan I rarely do spray tans
probably like once or twice a year but
I'm going to Mexico
and I'm just kind of feeling it do you
so I don't know how long I'm going to be
able to keep this foundation on because
I have to go there before they close
tonight but we're going to do our best I
was planning on waking up super early to
film this but I woke up with a migraine
so that didn't happen so this is pretty
be creamy but it's blending out really
nice I am gonna put a little bit of this
to highlight because this is just like
too dark to walk outside so I'm just
putting this on the center of my face
just to lighten everything up a little
bit hopefully concealer looks nice I'm
hoping it doesn't crease because it does
look pretty creamy I always set my
concealer with the stargazer powder I
don't know why we're doing a full face
thing right now but let's just do it
don't feel like I want to set this with
the powder I love the finish of it and I
don't want to take away from that I'm
just using whatever's left over on the
brush just to put right on the center of
my face not a whole lot of powder
product on here at all I'm going to do
the rest of my makeup and I'll be right
back
right now it's 10:45 alright so the rest
my makeups on it's now 11 o'clock whoo
that's a quick one feel like my face is
looking extra highlighted right now
because not used to wearing like an NC
30 over here so color aside because I
really wish this was like four shades
lighter it looks really nice it looks
very skin-like I don't think I would
call this full coverage I can definitely
still see freckles coming through but I
like that because it's covering up the
stuff I need to cover up but it still
looks very skin-like I feel like if
you're someone who has a lot of stuff to
cover up but it's summer and you don't
want to like cake on the foundation or
look super matte or whatever it is I
really am liking the way this looks
we'll see how it holds up throughout the
day but right now it's looking super
nice as far as the lifting claim I don't
know I'm not seeing too much lifting
happening do you I didn't have any
trouble blending out brush brush hold
blending out brought words blush bronzer
highlight I didn't use a whole lot of
bronzer today because I'm looking pretty
bronzed as it is the blush I uses the
Catrice illuminating blush and mixed
feelings on this I don't really like the
glitters in it but I do like the color
in the shade lip Vienna rose by the way
highlight is my fave essence eyeshadow
and 0/1 snowflake such a great pale
highlight and then on my eyes literally
all they used is this polish choice it's
actually a blush and contour palette all
I used was this this and this it's
actually blush but I just blended it
into my crease a little bit a very
extravagant combo and
lips right now of colour-pop lippie
pencil in BFF then I have the NYX
lingerie liquid lipstick and baby doll
then on top of that I have the NYX high
voltage lipstick in Mirage just kind of
on the center of my lips and I think
that's everything on my face right now
so I'm going to wear this as long as
possible before I go to the tanning
thing by the way it's 11 o'clock did I
already say that I don't know so I will
check back in throughout the day so it's
11:15 and I just wanted to let you guys
know that in about 15 minutes it has
pretty much fully set it's not
transferring anymore it feels more of
like a almost powder finish but it still
feels very skin like it doesn't look any
more matte really it just feels like
it's totally set now so it does take
about 15 minutes to set all right so
it's now 4:30 in the afternoon so the
Foundation's been on for about five and
a half hours and I'm doing this check-in
and natural wedding so you guys can see
the difference but now that I've been
outside I've looked at it outside in my
car and indoor lighting it's not lying
me as much as it was under the studio
lights and when I first applied it the
look of it kind of reminds me of like a
tinted moisturizer shade is definitely
too dark see where I blended it down my
neck and then my actual neck color here
there's just something about the way
that it looks on my skin that I feel
like it just looks like a tinted
moisturizer now the thing that I do like
is that when you touch it it feels a
hundred percent like skin if you're one
of those people that really likes a
foundation to feel like your skin and
it's not going to like transfer
everywhere and come off this one totally
feels like that getting real up close
and personal right now upper lip and
around the nose area looks really good
actually
you can definitely see it up here so
right now it's just really not wowing me
I was editing back the footage from
earlier and it looked really good I
think it looked really good when I first
applied it and like under the lights you
can't see a lot of stuff coming through
definitely not full coverage you can
totally see all this I'm trying to check
back one more time in a couple hours and
just see my final thoughts but I think I
have a pretty good idea right now
alright so it's only been an hour since
the last check-in is 5:30 now but I'm
going to call this one a wrap though
about a pack still go to the tanning
place wrapping up some more
stuff and have an entire other video to
edit and have to wrap up this video it's
been on for six and a half hours so
sorry this is a little bit shorter than
my usual check-in I'm not impressed
not too much more to say than in my last
check-in but basically I just think this
doesn't look that great I have gotten a
little bit oily oils coming off on my
finger but nothing in busy oil wise it
just looks very average to me I guess
kinda reminds me of the Elsi Foundation
which I did a whole review on during
1582 foundation this was a ten dollar
foundation I don't think it would be
worth it since this is $67 Foundation I
especially don't think it's worth it
since it didn't settle into any of the
lines are on my upper lip or my nose
area which is pretty rare for me if you
have more mature skin or you have some
wrinkles and you have a hard time
finding a foundation that doesn't settle
into those lines this one didn't seem to
really settle anywhere which is a plus I
would definitely recommend getting a
sample first before buying the full size
of this I will probably be returning
this I just don't think it's really
worth it to me for what I like and what
I look for in a foundation and I hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you did
make sure you give it a thumbs up love
you guys thanks for watching see you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
