better come out of this when I open it
all right so today is foundation Friday
favorite day of the week if you are a
new here this is where we try out a new
foundation every single Friday on my
channel today we are trying out a
frickin pricey foundation this is the LA
Prairie cellular treatment foundation
powder finish basically press powder
foundation is retails for $95 and you
get point 5 ounces of product which is
actually a lot compared to a lot of the
other powder products that I own this
powder foundation but it cosmetics has
zero point three ounces Laura Geller has
0.35 so you do get a bit more product in
here and I feel like you should for the
ninety five dollar price tag comes in
this little velvet pouch which is almost
too classy for me probably wouldn't keep
this in there the actual product looks
kind of like a business card holder to
me but super pretty for a powder
foundation this is like beautiful
packaging and then you open it up and
you have the powder product on one side
and then you get a giant applicator
sponge I picked this up because a few
different vloggers have been raving
about this lately all the people that
I've seen do a review on this have a
very nice skin and it seems to be full
coverage on them so I wanted to put this
to the test with someone who it doesn't
have perfect skin
I have cystic acne I have a lot to cover
up I wanted to get this mainly to test
for those of you who don't have flawless
skin to see if it gives the same kind of
effect personally if I did do YouTube
and I wasn't reviewing this product for
you guys I don't think I would have the
balls to pay ninety five dollars for a
powder foundation unless it was
life-changing and magical but that's
just me I know some people would be
happy to pay that and some people would
be totally out of their price range so
on both Nordstrom and La Prairie they
don't have a whole lot of information
about the product it only comes in six
shades which is definitely a downside
but I feel like for powder products
that's fairly typical I have the shade
ivory this was very hard to figure out
which shade was actually the lightest I
tried googling it looking at swatches on
Nordstrom and la pareja the actual color
shades weren't in order I just to
darkest so just be aware of that if
you're gonna order it I actually had to
call the Nordstrom in Seattle and
have them figure out which was the
lightest shade and then order for me so
you can apply this product wet or dry it
says the versatile dual finish treatment
combines the creamy coverage of a
foundation with the ultra fine feel of a
powder for a flawless light reflective
matte finish very refined totally
beautiful
it's totally customizable to whatever
level of coverage you desire that's what
it says so as far as the coverage claims
it says dry application you're supposed
to be able to get a light to full
coverage which seems like a very large
spectrum to me you're supposed to be
able to achieve whatever kind of
coverage you want with using this
product dry says apply wet for maximum
coverage
I like the foundation Friday put this
down below if you missed any of the
videos I've done so far you can go watch
that playlist it has all the foundation
Friday videos voicecrack if you guys
liked this video while you're watching
and are excited about foundation Friday
make sure you give it a thumbs up all
right it is 8:20 in the morning got the
coffee kind of feeling these glass mugs
I found this at Dollar Tree let's clip
back the hair I have already primed my
face today I'm using every single day at
the jouer anti blemish matte primer my
skin went through a really good phase
and now we're back in the bad phase so I
have a ton of breakouts on this side of
my face right now this left side is
pretty clear I have like one or two but
for the most part it's all over here so
we're gonna see how oh this powder
covers and when this video goes up I'm
actually gonna be in the salon
this Friday hopefully on the last stage
of going to silver so if you want to see
my hair first you can follow me on
snapchat so since this is a powder and
I'm going to be applying it dry you time
you go in with a powder product you want
it to be the last step after all your
liquids you don't want to be putting a
liquid on top of the powder creates a
super weird texture so I'm going to go
in with my under eye concealer first I
might try and spot conceal on one side
of my face and then not do the other
side just so we can see how well the
powder covers without a concealer and
then with a concealer I feel like for
the most part if you have acne or major
pigmentation to cover up and you're
going to be using a powder foundation
you would want to probably spot conceal
a little bit beforehand just so you
don't have to use as much powder
especially when your powder is ninety
five freaking dollars but then I know
they're going to be people who say they
want to see how it performs on its own
so you can't please everyone but we're
going to try so I'm going to go in under
my eyes like usual this is the Tarte
shaped ape concealer I have been
obsessed with this stuff I literally
haven't had to powder my under eyes they
just stay creaseless all day it is
fantastic I just wanted to quickly
mention that if you are in the New York
area I'm going to be doing a meet-up
September 30th that Friday night the
Friday night before beauty con my time
this video comes out I'll probably have
all the details hopefully so I'm gonna
leave those in the description box down
below or working out logistics right now
it's going to be with Mallory and then
julep
so if you guys can make it I would love
to meet some of you guys you don't have
to have a beauty contact or anything
it's just going to be a julep Meetup
I've never done like an organized meetup
or anything so hoping people show up so
I'm going to do a little bit of spot
concealing just right here and when you
spot conceal with this Tarte shape tape
you literally need like the smallest dot
ever and the brush I'm using by the way
is the morphe 38 I love this for
blending and concealer maybe we should
do this whole side of my face yeah let's
do that okay so for the most part on
this side of my face I have a lot of the
redness cover it up a little bit with
concealer and then here we go so like I
said you can't apply this wet or dry for
dry application it does say a light to
full coverage so you can still
apparently get full coverage applying it
dry I personally hate applying powder
foundations what every time I've tried
to apply a powder wet it kind of ruins
the powder in the pan holy crap this
comes in a freaking velvet pouch super
pretty packaging it's very light
actually I thought was going to be a lot
heavier it does look like a business
card holder though from what I've heard
the applicator that it comes with this
sponge actually applies it best but I do
have a Coastal Scents powder brush right
here so I'm going to test that out to
kind of feel like I'm about to wipe gold
on my face right now let's start to
apply one of I should like press or wipe
so we're just going to try both
I don't feel like it's covering a whole
lot I might not be getting enough
product so okay this is not really
comforting it's definitely toning down
the redness a little bit and I have put
quite a bit of powder on don't try like
pressing it in to see if that helps dang
I was kind of expecting like a miracle
powder not gonna lie all right I think
we might actually have to try and apply
it wet I'm going to take that brush and
swirl it and see if we can get some more
coverage mmm no shoot okay well let's
try and apply this side with the
concealer and see how it looks straight
wise I think it works the shade actually
looks light enough and is matching my
skin tone which is great even my nose
where like I don't have anything really
to cover up it doesn't look like it's
giving a ton of coverage pretty much see
everything it's just less red than this
side because of the concealer so let's
try the brush again on the forehead on
this side yeah the brush gives virtually
no coverage whoo I'm not liking this
even like you mean you guys saw my
forehead it's pretty clear I just have
like freckles and redness and it is
toning down the redness but I'm going to
do a shot in natural lighting afterwards
so you can really see how much it's not
covering so to try and apply this wet
I'm going to wet this sponge and I'm
also going to wet my Real Techniques
sponge and just see so dampen Bo sponges
this better work
man kind of bummed kind of bummed I feel
like I shouldn't have had as high
expectations just because both videos I
saw were people who have awesome skin so
let's try the Real Techniques sponge I'm
using so much powder too by the way I
think I've layered this like four times
by now so the side that we put the
concealer on looks like I don't you know
I don't even think I would call this
medium coverage I don't think there's
much of a difference applying the Real
Techniques sponge versus this sponge so
this was with pretty much three or four
layers of powder and not super excited
about it I'm going to go show you guys
right now and natural lighting because I
think I want to apply some concealer to
these areas because I wouldn't wear like
a full face of makeup with this it's
just not enough coverage at all for me
pretty much all of my acne on the site
is showing so I'm going to show you guys
what it looks like without more
concealer so you can see and then in
order to do like the full wear test I do
have to go run errands and stuff today
so I'm going to apply it a little bit
more concealer alright so we are in
natural lighting right now here's what
my forehead looks like to me it looks
pretty powdery right here and is
clinging on a tiny bit to some dry
patches this I just don't like at all
how this is sitting as you can see
there's just like virtually no coverage
on this and it does look pretty powdery
on my face let's try and apply a little
concealer over this and the house is
going to go since I am putting concealer
on top of powder at this point but in
order to do this video and wear it all
day we're putting on concealer not
horrible on top of the powder if you
like the powder is just emphasizing my
pores right here man I really don't see
the coverage at all it looks like a very
light coverage powder to me so basically
the only places I placed concealer were
under my eyes and then to spot conceal
the acne so it's now 848 in the morning
I'm going to apply the rest of my makeup
and I'll be right back alright so it's
now and I
in 10 and the rest of my makeup is on
obviously putting powder on powder blush
bronzer highlight blended out fine I'm
gonna tell you guys everything that's on
my face in a second but now that the
rest of my makeup is on with the
concealer that we added it looks fine
like I would wear this outside but off
the bat I'm just pretty underwhelmed
with this even the finish of it I don't
think looks that revolutionary if you
want a good powder that has a ton of
coverage for a powder foundation a
cosmetic celebration foundation
illumination is amazing I have worn this
by itself and a death one gives off more
coverage than this powder and it also
has a really beautiful illuminating kind
of finish I would say this one is on the
satin matte side
I do have highlight on so that makes it
look a little bit more dewy even with
the concealer I feel like I still have
pretty much a light light coverage
you'll see how it holds up I do have
combination skins I tend to get a little
bit oily on my t-zone throughout the day
let's tell you it was on my face so for
blush bronzer and highlight this blush
and bronzer palette by Coastal Scents is
brand new
look familiar so for contour I use this
shade right here blush I did a mix of
this peach shade right here and then
this like purpley you then highlight it
took the white shade from this little
trio and that's also what's on the inner
corner of my eyes and then for the rest
of my eyes is the new urban decay naked
ultimate basics palette I really like
this blend it out really easily
I like the shades in here I want to keep
playing around with this because so far
I'm feeling it and then lips are Kylie
cosmetics Dolce K liquid lipstick we're
gonna call the check-in time at 9 a.m.
since I started putting on the rest my
makeup at about 8:50 s 9:00 a.m. check
back in a few hours
alright so it's now 538 p.m. so the
foundations been on for about 8 hours
and 38 minutes ooh
so I don't know what is going on on my
nose but it's pretty much like all worn
off on my nose and my nose looks super
red major creasing around my nose my
forehead doesn't look great it's
definitely gotten oily throughout the
day but it's not the good kind of skin
dude that I usually like it's a little
bit too oily for me blush bronzer
highlight did stay on pretty well though
throughout the day so that's a good sign
I guess they're just parts of my face
my pores look giant I'm going to turn
off this light in a second and just show
you in front of the ring light so I can
dim it but there's just definitely parts
of my face that look a little bit heavy
okay here we go now you can really see
so you can see the creasing around here
and I don't think that's a concealer
because like I said I've been wearing
this every day and I haven't noticed
that really red around my nose right
here it just looks very heavy in certain
parts of my face and like who knew I had
pores right here I do
apparently chin looks a little bit
patchy like it looks like there's ignore
my lipstick that's like half worn off it
looks like there's powder here and then
none here and then it's kind of taped up
right here again this is just like
totally worn off down here and then my
forehead just looks quite greasy not
really dewy to me just greasy so yeah
totally worn off on my nose hope you
enjoyed seeing every crevice of my face
so my personal thoughts on this not
worth ninety-five dollars I don't think
I would pay 20 dollars for this I might
try wearing it over a liquid foundation
but even then unless it looks incredible
I probably wouldn't keep it since it
does say that you're supposed to be able
to build it up to get some coverage I
don't think it lives up to the coverage
claims it's interesting because usually
when powders have good coverage when you
swatch it you can kind of tell and this
one when I swatch on my hand it
literally just disappears into my hand
like I can't even see where I just put
it on even if you have really great skin
it just doesn't seem worth it to me
didn't Wow me when I put it on and it's
not wowing me right now as far as other
skin types that I think this might be
good for it's honestly just a very
average powder to me I am constantly
more wowed by it cosmetics like I say in
every video watch different reviews form
your own opinions every product works
differently for different people this is
just my experience with the product but
for me this one is a no even though this
product was it done for me I hope you
