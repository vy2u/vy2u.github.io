asking for in life
all right so today it is foundation
Friday happy foundation Friday friends I
did a poll on snapchat between two
foundations asking you guys which one
you wanted to see it was between the
jcat cushion compact foundation this is
a new cushion foundation and the
covergirl clean sensitive liquid
foundation salt sculpt the covergirl 1-1
by over half so we're doing this one
today let me know if you still want to
see the jcat cushion foundation down
below so this product by covergirl is
not totally new but it has an improved
formula or that's what it says on here I
did some research to figure out what is
up with this foundation and the OG
version is like a blue bottle then they
made a version where it has a green
label and then now the new improved
formula has this white label so if you
have the other two I'm assuming they're
different formulas this one was on a new
end cap display kind of thing so you get
one fluid ounce of product in here it
retails for between about $5.99 and
$8.99 the bottle is pretty annoying it
has the old school just like pour out
kind of bottle with a screw on tap tap
top the claims on this foundation are
pretty dang limited the most I can find
out about this was on cover girls
website and it says sensitive skin
dreams of foundation this light and
delicate cover girls clean sensitive
okay blah blah unscented oil-free
formula sues redness and moisturizes
flaky sensitive skin without irritating
or clogging pores it comes in nine
shades I have the shade 505 ivory which
is the lightest shade I've combination
skin with cystic acne so I tend to get
oily throughout the day on my t-zone
especially in the past covergirl
foundations typically haven't worked
very well for me I find that they
oxidized a ton on my skin so I'm going
to insert some swatch comparison so you
can see how this foundation compares to
some of the other products that I own
I have on this scrunchy shirt thing so
we can just ignore that right here is
the covergirl foundation in the shade
505 next to it is Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless 110 L'Oreal True
Match in c1 and Mac Studio Fix in NW 10
keep in mind that I just applied all
these so if any of these are going to
oxidize they haven't yet I am starting
to buy and collect foundations for the
next 15 days of foundation which is
November 5th to the 20th so make sure to
let me know tweet me snap me whatever
what you want to see for 15 days of
foundation this video will be going up
right before I'm about to leave for New
York so if you're in the New York area
I'm doing a burrito Meetup and a mal pal
Meetup Mallory 17:12 and I are doing
meet up with julep September 30th I'm
have all the details for the meetup down
below but I would love to see you guys
there and we you in real life that would
be freaking awesome so you should come
like always the playlist for foundation
Friday will be linked down below if you
missed any of these videos I do a new
first impression video every single
Friday so if you want to see how this
foundation applies and where's
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching pin meThe the
hair I had to take one of my migraine
pills a couple hours ago so I'm feeling
pretty drowsy right now but my head
feels better so far to prime my face
with the jouer anti blemish matte primer
ence has been one of my favorites lately
what was that this primer has been one
of my favorites lately it is pretty
pricey but it has salicylic acid in it
and I just feel like my skin really
likes this so like usual I'm going to do
a brush on one side my face in a sponge
on the other side today I have the Sigma
f80 flat kabuki brush this is one of my
favorite brushes for foundation it
doesn't have a pump you just have to
pour it out and hope a shit-ton doesn't
come out whoa this is super liquidy very
liquidy it looks kind of like we'll see
so I'm start with a brush on this side
of my face and I'm just going to go
ahead and kind of stipple it on that
palette and let's go to town I feel like
I'm forgetting to do something
so lately I've actually been kind of
spot concealing but before I put on
foundation because you just have to use
way less product I don't know why I
haven't been doing that for like years
but I've been really liking it okay this
is pretty good coverage for my first
impression of videos I'm not going to be
doing that because then you can't
actually see how much the foundation
covers up on its own so this looks like
I have weirdly some color right now I
don't know what's going on I've never
had color in my entire life but this
summer I like weirdly got a little not
tan but like I'm not my normal ghost
goes white itself I don't know if
there's still some like self-tanner left
over if it's just freckles so I look
darker I know what's going on I
literally have never gotten a tan in my
life so it's confusing time
covergirl foundations almost always
oxidize on me the three-in-one
foundation i legit turn orange by the
end of the day is sitting on my skin
decently I wouldn't say it looks like
great I still see my redness and light
zits and stuff coming through just on
that one layer with a brush I feel like
it's about medium coverage maybe I do
feel like this one is going to build so
we'll see I will do a second layer yeah
right now this is actually looking a
little bit light I'm using about a
quarter size amount of product so that
was a quarter size on half of my face so
now I'm going to go with my Real
Techniques sponge for the other side it
has better coverage than I was expecting
like that card pretty dang well with
that redness so I think I like it better
with the sponge
yeah finish wise it looks way nicer with
the sponge you can just see less texture
on my face in my time right now and I'm
filming this I'm actually going to the
slow on tomorrow for hopefully the
silver probably stick me talking about
this because I feel like I'm updating
you in every video since these are all
pre-recorded but as I pretty much all
the blue greyish is out of my hair right
now because I washed it like three times
last night to get it all out before I go
into her satin matte finish but more on
the matte side so I'm going with a thin
second layer just to see if we can build
this up and I'm going to use a sponge so
I do like how it applies butter okay
not bad you guys this is with about one
and a half players I did do a pretty
thin second layer it looks a little bit
heavy around my pores I'm hoping that
doesn't kick up throughout the day I
think you can definitely see my pores
right now even on the middle of my
forehead right here but it doesn't look
horrible with two layers we got about I
would say high medium coverage I swear
to almost already starting to oxidize
the shade of it does look more normal so
here's a close-up I can't dim the
softbox light like I used to be able to
with the ring light I'm going to do the
next check-in and natural lighting so
you guys can really see how it looks our
check-in time is going to be 9:10 and
I'm going to do the rest of my makeup
and then I will be right back right the
rest of my makeups on it's now 9:45 but
I'm going to call the check-in time 9:10
since that's when I finish the face I'm
going to tell you everything that's on
my face in a second but first let's talk
about the foundation so I ended up
setting the foundation with the powder I
do think it was one of those that I
maybe could have gone without a setting
powder but it looked very almost heavy
like I feel like I needed something to
kind of smooth out my pores and just
smooth out my skin so I went in with the
cover effects illuminating setting
powder this is one of my favorite
setting powders I do feel like the
powder helps to smooth out my skin
however I feel very heavy right now it
kind of feels and looks like the Mac
Studio Fix foundation it has that look
of I'm wearing foundation which with a
full face of makeup I actually don't
mind because obviously I'm wearing
makeup if you're looking for that like
everyday natural skin like finish this
one isn't that however I do like the
coverage that I got I feel like this is
going to be one of those that it totally
depends on what brush you use how much
product you use how you apply it
it just has that feeling to me but for
the way that I applied it I mean I got
pretty damn good coverage I didn't use
any concealer or anything over my acne
and it fully covered everything with
those two layers because I put on a
second layer that could be why it's
feeling kind of heavy at this point in
time it doesn't look or feel heavy to
the point where I wouldn't wear it again
it just feels like a morning makeup so
like usually I set my face
the next do we finish setting spray this
doesn't alter the finish of the
foundation that much almost that's it I
feel so accomplished when I almost
finished product it has four shirt
oxidized which is actually perfect
because now I feel like it matches me
really well so let's talk about what's
on the rest I found a contour shade that
I really like and I am wearing a warm
blush on top so it's kind of tricky for
you to just see the contour right now
but I snapped about it it's the morphe
and 9c palette and it's the shade right
here this bottom left shade it's
actually almost identical to the next
taupe blush which is a great contour
your pale skin but they stopped making
this you can get it on Amazon now but
they stopped actually selling it but
this shade right here looks pretty much
identical on my eyes all I used was this
contour palette I just used a mix of all
these shades to create this eye look and
then on my lid is this hot makeup
luminous eyeshadow in the shade nothing
to lose this is so pretty
such a nice formula it feels almost like
gel like for blush I use the hot makeup
red carpet-ready blush in the shade
wanderlust
peachy bronze II shade it almost looks
like bronzer on me but I've been feeling
the look of bronzers blush lately so I
use that and then as a highlight I used
my ELF illuminating palette this is one
of my favorite highlights of life I mean
look at that glow I use this light shade
right here which I pit pan on what else
Oh on the lips is the solo look by de
peche girl collaboration which is a very
beautiful color it's like this moggy
rose almost really like the color I've
never worn it before so we'll see how
the formula holds up so I'm going to go
about my day live my life and I will be
back to check in in a few hours okay so
it's now 111 in the afternoon so the
foundation has been on for four hours so
let's take a look I only looked in the
mirror one time the last four hours I've
just been working and instantly the
first thing I noticed is this lip
creasing it's kind of out of this world
whoa so let's get real up close as you
can see these are pretty intense like
holy
starting to look pretty heavy around my
nose area right here putting some
creasing the nose area creasing is
pretty normal for me but this is very
intense everywhere else looks pretty
good at this point my only other
critique right now is that it just feels
pretty foundation me like when I move my
forehead I don't know it just feels like
I'm wearing a lot of makeup but here you
go take it all in I have the camera on
my computer or standing desk right now I
don't know why I've never thought to do
that out here I usually like kneel on
the hardwood floor I feel like it
actually matches now since it started
out a little bit light but if you start
out with it matching you or being
slightly too dark it will definitely be
like Snooki status in a couple hours so
like I said for hours I will check back
in at the end of the night okay so it's
now 6:10 p.m. so foundations went on for
nine hours I figured we do this check-in
and natural lighting too because there
is still light like 77 degrees in
Seattle right now what is it going on
thought we were in fall so it doesn't
look a whole lot different from the last
check-in my forehead actually looks
pretty good there's just major creasing
around my upper lip pretty much
everywhere and I haven't even been
talking or anything I've literally just
been on the computer working so keep in
mind that's with like no motion in my
lips pretty much it just looks pretty
heavy my forehead oil wise looks okay
but the center of my face right here
just looks a little bit cakey my pores
and upper lip area just look bad the
rest of my face looks okay these are
just pretty intense and new ones have
formed there's like one two three four I
don't know what's going on over here I
don't know if the camera is going to
pick up the texture but just looks very
textured in here is it horrible
no is it great in my opinion no I feel
like we've had a lot of like duds lately
in foundation Friday and need a good I
need a good one to come along it just
looks okay I think there are way better
drugstore foundations if you want to
know what my favorites are following my
holy grail drugstore products video down
below I really don't even know if I
would mix this one just because there's
not something in it that I particularly
like for example on one layer
owen didn't have great coverage the
finish isn't that great shade why is it
oxidized so there isn't really one thing
in it that I would think would be good
to mix with another product if you know
what I mean
I might try using it with like a
smoothing primer underneath and maybe a
different setting powder or not setting
it at all as far as what kind of skin
types this would work on probably not
the best for dry skin it doesn't have a
super moisturizing feel when it goes on
just the way to emphasize the texture
and stuff I would say if you have dry
skin stay away from this one if you have
oily skin with the powder it held up
pretty well as far as controlling oil
mature skin would definitely stay away
from this one just because it majorly
settles into any lines that you have is
it worth spending your money on probably
not I think your eight dollars or six
dollars could be better spent on a
different drugstore foundation so that's
kind of my thoughts on this one I just
have my hair in a clip so it's looking
real funky right now if you guys liked
this video and you're liking the
foundation Friday series make sure you
give it a thumbs up so I know let me
know down below what products you guys

foundation Friday love you guys thanks
