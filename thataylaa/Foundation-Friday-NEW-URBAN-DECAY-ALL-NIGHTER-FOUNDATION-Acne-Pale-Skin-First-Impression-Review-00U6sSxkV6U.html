is the very first foundation Friday on
my channel hope you guys are excited I'm
excited if you missed kind of the
overview of all of this go watch the
best and worst of 15 days of foundation
video kind of walks through what I'm
doing with 15 days of foundation and
also foundation Friday but basically
every single Friday on my channel we're
gonna have a first impression foundation
review which I'm so excited about
because I love trying out new
foundations these are some of my
favorite videos to make and I know
there's some of your guys's favorite to
watch hopefully the head you guys vote
on snapchat by screenshotting the
foundation that you want to see and it
was between this and the covergirl BB
cream so the covergirl BB cream will
probably be next week but this one won
by over double I can say what this is
this is the Urban Decay all nighter
waterproof long wear liquid foundation
this is brand-new from Urban Decay this
was supposed to release in the fall but
I think there was so much hype on social
media of this that they released it
early you can now find this on Sephora
and on the Urban Decay website and I
have the shade 0.5 if you watch 15 days
of foundation you know that the Urban
Decay Naked Skin Foundation was one of
my favorites I'm gonna like that
playlist down below if you missed it so
when I saw that they came out with a
full coverage foundation I was pumped so
let's find some of the claims
so this foundation retails for $40 it
comes in 24 shades and there is one
fluid ounce of product in here that's
pretty standard for foundation I like
that they have a nice shade range it
does look like there's some nice deeper
shades as well as fair shades
okay so swatch time right here we have
the Urban Decay all nighter in 0.5 this
is Urban Decay Naked in 0.5 this is
Tarte rainforest to the sea in the
lightest shade Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
Y to 0-5 Von D locket tattoo foundation
l42 and Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless 110 wow they have a very dense
product description on the Urban Decay
website of this full coverage with a
modern matte finish that never looks
overdone serious long-lasting wear
perfect for all night affairs and other
scandalous activities is literally what
they say
website it says well naked skin
complexion products are Demi matte the
all-nighter liquid foundation is
completely matched so they say that this
foundation has about three times as much
pigment as the Urban Decay Naked
foundation was supposed to modify and
absorb oil to reduce the appearance of
shine it's waterproof and paraben free
so that is pretty much all the claims if
you guys are excited about fifty days of
foundation fifteen days if you guys are
excited about foundation Friday give
this video a thumbs up let me know down
below what foundations you want to see
next week if you want to see how this
foundation applies and wears throughout
the day you're in the right place just
keep watching
whoo took like three cups of coffee to
get me going this morning though I have
combination skin with cystic acne this
is a decent skin week for me I do have
some big breakouts coming in down on my
chin so I have the foundation here I'm
so excited to try this I've the shade
0.5 which I probably already told you in
the intro and this bottle is just
gorgeous and like we did during all the
reviews during 15 days of foundation I'm
going to do the brush on one side of my
face and then a sponge on the other side
of my face see if there's a difference
in application washed moisturized and
prior to my face already I use the cover
effects what is that one called has
likes also fasted in it it's one the
only primers it doesn't break me out
like the exact one down below so it
actually looks a little bit runnier than
I was expecting you can see it gliding
down the palette so I'm just going to
start by stippling some of this on and
blending out and this is supposed to be
a matte foundation which I usually don't
woo this has good coverage whoa okay
I usually don't reach for matte
foundations too often just because I
like a little bit more of a skin like
finish but I am getting pretty oily
throughout the day since it's summer
ends good not everyone thinks the adil
it's cold but in the summer it does get
like high 80s and 90s sometimes and we
don't have AC because no one is used to
having heat in Seattle first initial
impressions it's actually a nice finish
it's more like a satin matte finish you
can still see the light reflecting off
it a little bit really great coverage I
don't feel like I need to layer this so
I got pretty damn good coverage for a
matte foundation I really like the way
that that applied so far I think I put
one pump of foundation on here and I
haven't even used half of this yet
smashing my neck pretty well looking a
little bit textured on my forehead with
the brush especially right in the center
of my face isn't majorly clinging to dry
patches but I can see the foundation on
my forehead though let's go in with
sponge on the other side I've never used
this sponge this is one the new morphe
sponges so let's just pounce let me know
in the comments down below what
foundations you guys want to see during
foundation Friday I have a bunch that we
didn't get to for 15 days a foundation
okay so this is applying a lot more
sheer with a sponge for me in the kind
of coverage I like I think I like the
brush side a little bit better both
sides look really nice this one just
looks a little bit lighter coverage and
I did use more product with the sponge
I'm going to finish off my forehead with
a sponge though just to see if it looks
less textured up there
this sponge too could just be soaking up
a lot of product since I haven't use
this one yet yeah I definitely like to
side with the brush better so I have
used up all the product for my full face
which Rox I usually can't get away with
a single pump for my full face I'm going
to go in I just put way too much on why
did I do that I just need a tiny bit of
this I don't know I just pumped a whole
thing I'm going to go in and just cover
up some of the spots over here with the
brush foundation goes so far with a
brush you seriously need the tiniest bit
putting a tiny bit more on my forehead
and I feel like it's pretty rare for me
when I feel like I don't need a second
layer just to clarify because now that
I'm editing this back that sounds kind
of confusing I only put a second layer
on the side that I applied the sponge
just even out my face so it looked like
the same kind of coverage that I got
with the brush I applied my full face
with the brush I definitely would not
need a second layer I only added a
little bit more coverage on this side of
my face didn't touch this side let's do
a close-up so you can see how it's
sitting on my face really nice coverage
still looks like a satin matte finish to
me doesn't look totally matte which I
like the forehead doesn't look bad
textured it just doesn't look quite as
invisible as some of the other
foundations I own it looks a little bit
heavy around my poor area right here and
it is a little bit like crusty around my
nose right here I'm gonna go with the
sponge without product and see if I can
kind of even that out
okay that just like took away some
product do you guys do that okay this is
like pretty much totally set which is
great since this is a matte long-wear
foundation and it feels like it's pretty
much set I'm not going to set this with
the powder I'm going to use a setting
spray though because I use that every
single day so I would apply the rest of
my makeup and I will be right back okay
so it is 852 let's call it 9:00 a.m. and
the rest of our makeup is on clearly on
my lips is a beach milkshake with a
little bit of the color pop lip gloss
their new ultra glossy lip in the shade
fairy floss blush bronzer highlight
blend it out beautifully on top of it I
didn't have to set it with a powder at
all which I love I love just being able
to put on a foundation blend out your
powder products without having it like
cling to weird patches and stuff the
finish of the foundation definitely
doesn't look totally matte to me I think
it's a perfect that and finish my
forehead does look more on the dewy side
but again these lights reflect off my
face so it makes everything with a
little bit more shiny so far I don't
have any complaints I was looking at it
up close before
and it looks really nice I'm getting a
tiny bit of creasing around this area so
I hope that doesn't get worse but yeah
no complaint so far I'm headed to the
chiropractor right now so I'm really
hoping he doesn't put me like facedown
in the cradle but if he does I guess
we'll see how this foundation lasts
okay so it's now two eleven so the
Foundation's been on four or five hours
and I've been out pretty much most of
the day and I've gotta say it looks
frickin bomb and natural lighting it
looks pretty natural especially for
being a matte finish but it still gives
you coverage the only area that doesn't
look too great is around my upper lip
and nose area which is usually kind of
my problem areas where my foundation
tends to crease a little bit I don't
have the same expression lines I usually
do there in like weird different places
but I don't think it's anything too
horrible blush bronzer highlight it's
still fully on forehead looks good not
super matte though like I can definitely
see my oil coming through a little bit
not a whole lot is actually coming off
on my finger it's just that it looks a
little bit Dewey which I don't mind
I did change my lip color it's the
makeup for ever see 502
stick look at this purple shade I feel
like when I finally have silver hair the
shade will be great all right so I will
wear this for a few more hours and check
back in at the end of the night it is
now 10 12 p.m. so the Foundation's been
on for 13 hours I think this is the
longest first impression check-in thing
I've ever done I couldn't get a shot in
natural lighting because I ended up
going to the beach I thought I was going
to be back before now but I just got
home so based on how it looks right now
on my forehead area and around my nose
this is from my sunglasses I usually get
really bad sunglass lines but these are
pretty intense they went all the way
down here is pretty much totally worn
off on my forehead right now I didn't
even go in the water it was just really
hot so I wouldn't say this is like super
sweat proof or for like super hot
weather but also this was without a
setting powder I feel like the rest of
my face looks pretty good for 13 hours
without a setting powder I did look at
my face around the 8 or 9 hour mark like
before I went to the beach and it looked
pretty dang good it did oxidize looking
at it compared to my chest it's a tad
dark but it doesn't look super orange on
me or anything I am excited about this
one for a couple reasons one I'm really
happy that for an everyday foundation
like we're not going to be going to the
beach you're like massively sweating I
really like that I didn't feel like I
needed to use a setting powder even at
about the 8 hour mark it still looked
really good without a setting powder I
like that it wasn't super super matte
you can still see like the look of my
skin coming through it's just the way
that it applied and the fact that it got
such good coverage just in one thin
layer I didn't have to use a lot of this
at all in comparison and how much I use
of some other foundations if you have
dry skin isn't the most moisturizing
foundation I would probably say go with
Tarte rain forces and see over this one
if you have dry skin but if you're like
me and you have combo skin or you're
more in the oily side I think this one
is worth giving go if you like that full
coverage I like this one I definitely
will be wearing this again probably be
trying it out with like the cover
effects illuminating drops or something
but I do really like this one on its own
and I feel like that's pretty rare for
me to find a foundation without a powder
just on its own I feel like it does a
good enough job I don't have to mix
in with anything shade wise is good if
