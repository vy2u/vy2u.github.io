today we are putting to the test Revlon
Colorstay the old formula as well as the
new formula they repackage this added a
pump some people say the formula change
some people say it didn't I'm not sure
if Revlon actually ever said this is a
new formula but a lot of people think
that it is I'm gonna try it out today
and see side-by-side if there is a
difference in formula I'm gonna do the
old version on one side of my face and
the new version on the other side just
so we can see side by side if there is a
difference how the formula compares how
it wears throughout the day they also
came out with a new shade if you're a
pale princess they came around with 130
porcelain which is a new light shade I'm
actually using 150 buff today because I
had the old formula and the new formula
of that but I'm gonna do shade swatches
of all the shades I own I'm about to
check my neighbor's dog out the window
because it won't stop barking just
kidding I love you but stop talking
hopefully you guys can't hear that even
though the original version of color
stay has been out for years I've never
actually done a full review of this
product just to give you a little
background on my thoughts on the old
version I haven't used this foundation
in years probably at least a year and a
half maybe two years this was kind of
the first liquid foundation I really
used in high school
pretty sure was back when I just started
getting into makeup and like watching
YouTube videos and everyone raved about
this foundation I was someone who wore
this because 1/10 the lightest shade is
extremely pale I think the undertone for
me is a little bit off makes me look a
little bit pasty and ghostly but I kept
using it don't ask me why back in the
day this was like everyone said it was
good so I just kind of believed it was
good I don't really know what was good
and what was bad back then since it was
just the beginning of my makeup journey
how didn't tried a whole lot of products
yet but I wore this when I didn't really
know what I liked and disliked in the
foundation so I thought it was really
good at the time since then I've found
other foundations that I like better but
the original version I don't think is
bad it's just not my personal favorite
so Monro Vaughn's website right now
let's read some of the claims it comes
in this is so typical it says America's
number one foundation with an asterisk
and then when you read the asterisk it
says
Nielsen scan track who the knows
what Nielsen scan track is I'm googling
it because I'm actually kind of curious
probably some research company that they
pay to say that yep that's exactly what
it is okay anyway it's just got a side
rekt now with a mess free pump and it
has SPF what SPF does this have this has
SPF 20 in it so probably not the best
for flash photography because it does
have SPF in it comes in 35 shades which
is amazing for any foundation especially
for the drugstore foundation I know they
recently expanded their line it doesn't
say exactly by how many shades but I
feel like it was a lot love that they
have 35 shades and that they have a
wider range says comfortable lightweight
formula specifically made for combo oily
skin to control oil absorption and shine
so they have different versions of this
the 130 shade is actually a normal dry
skin and then the 150 bucks rate I have
is for combo oily skin the Congo oily
skin formula is when I try out today
obviously if you have more dry skin
you'll probably want to go for the dry
skin one it says is it buildable to full
coverage ooh I feel like this is new it
says a contain salicylic acid my skin
reacts very well to cell silic acid so
that is exciting but just for the combo
one oh this is interesting so the combo
oily actually has SPF 15 and then the
normal one has SPF 20 I'm not sure if
salicylic acid isn't both but right now
I'm on the combo oily skin one I just
wanted to show you guys this is the
description for the dry skin formula so
if you do have dry skin it isn't going
to contain salicylic acid it actually
has hyaluronic acid to help hydrate the
skin so that's pretty cool the dry skin
formula has 13 shades oily skin has 22
right here making it 35 total mass I own
three different shades so I'm gonna do
swatches of all of them for you guys so
you can see which one you think would be
best for you
alright swatch time so here is the old
formula in the shade 110 this is the new
formula in 130 which is the new shade as
well this is the new formula in 150 buff
and then old formula in 150 buff so
those two last shades buffed me the old
formula versus the new formula do look a
little bit different to me this one
looks a little bit yellower and a tiny
bit lighter maybe and then this
new porcelain shade just has more of a
peach undertone to it rather than like
pinky oh I should probably address the
hair hair is different we are not quite
silver yet but I've gotten it to this
gray tone which I am way more excited
about them like light brown blonde so I
can live with this while my hair repairs
itself again and then in a month or two
hopefully will be the last stage you're
curious about everything that's on my
hair and how I got it to this like
grayish whatever color this is I'm going
to leave the link to the Instagram post
down below where I explain all about the
hair I think that's everything if you
guys want to see how this foundation
applies and where's throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching all right so I've already
primed my face with this UA anti blemish
matte primer this has been one of my
favorites lately and we are going to
clip back the hair I don't know why but
this light is making this side look
normal and then the ring light makes
this look like greener I don't know so
I'm gonna try this it cosmetics heavenly
skin skin perfecting brush this is new
on one side of my face and the Real
Techniques sponge on the other side of
my face and if this brush isn't cutting
it I'll just go on with my normal Sigma
f80 or something says you can use it for
liquid or powder pretty much whatever
you want and I just think this is
beautiful you've already seen swatches
of all these foundations but I haven't
yet okay I'm doing a half face
old formula half face new oh how are we
gonna do brushes with that I didn't
think that through maybe I'll just try
blending it out with the brush first
since the only shade that I have old
formula and a new formula of is 150 buff
I'm gonna go ahead and try this the old
formula actually looks a tiny bit darker
like I said I haven't so watched these
yet so I'm not sure so both of these 150
buff shades are the combo oily formula
this thing is frickin sealed too let me
tell you no one's gonna be swatching
this thing with this so I'm gonna shake
both of these since I haven't used this
one in a long time so I did have a pump
put on my old Revlon Colorstay in 110
you can get these from Beauty MP I'm not
sure if they're still around but I got
this like years ago I'm gonna start with
the old formula we're gonna do the old
formula on this
my face in the new formula on this side
of my face no idea how the shade is
going to be I'm not sure if I ever
actually tried 150 buff but I'm putting
about a dime ish sized amount mmm okay
off the bat not liking this brush for me
it's I can already tell it's too flimsy
to get the kind of coverage I like and
you can see it sinking into this one
patch majorly right here so I'm going to
ditch that brush that was fast okay
going in with my Sigma f80 that brush
soaked up a ton of product so I'm kind
of little more out on the palette and
let's stipple this bad boy on so off of
that one layer
I got about medium coverage I do
remember that I always never someone who
got full full coverage on this for me
it's about a medium coverage you can
still see freckles coming through and
some acne so I'm gonna wait and we're
gonna do one layer on this side and then
maybe do a second layer depending on
what it's looking like starting with the
same amount about a dime-size and just
then the stipple the shape looks a
little more yellow to me almost this one
to me it feels kind of like gel when you
blend it out kind of like a gel
foundation and this one feels a little
bit less like a gel I actually at first
impressions like the way that this looks
a lot better getting a little better
coverage and also has a really nice
satin finish look at that versus this
side both of them right now are
emphasizing my pores a little bit but I
do like the way that this one looks on
my face better so far 150 buff in this
one is a pretty good shade match and you
still have a lot of product left over on
this side
what's it still medium coverage but I do
feel like it's a tiny bit higher medium
coverage on this side this looks like a
satin finish and this one is more on the
satin matte matte side with one layer
this is how the sides are looking the
only area where I feel like it doesn't
look the greatest is around my pores on
both sides
you can still see acne and stuff coming
through right here so we'll go in with a
tiny second layer lately I've been
actually spot concealing before I put on
foundation because I just have to use a
shit-ton less product if I spot
concealed before I put this on I would
be good to go right now like I wouldn't
have to do a second layer but because
this is a first impression and we want
to see how the foundation covers on its
own I do these videos without spot
concealing first so going back with the
old one I might use a sponge for the
second layer just to see so I'm going on
with the old formula right now on the
right side my face so definitely better
coverage on the second layer still
doesn't look totally full coverage to me
and I was going with the new formula
second layer just looks nice so we have
two layers on I'm going to take a look
up close yeah this side is not looking
too great around my nose I can tell us
in a k-cup because I already is this one
just looks a lot more dry on me like
it's clinging to some dry patches down
here this one looks beautiful I'm liking
this side this side is clinging to more
stuff on my forehead for sure my pores
don't look great on this side but it
doesn't look as textured as it does on
this side I might as well do this first
impression on camera - this is the it
cosmetics bye bye under-eye illumination
pretty sure this is new and this is in
the shade light woah super thick but it
says it's under eye right yeah bye bye
Andre so we'll see I'm just gonna dab
some of this under the eyes woah this is
very thick not thick like sticky it is
really brightening though a little
tricky to blend out so I'm gonna set
under my eyes but I don't think I'm
gonna set my full face because it is one
of those foundations to me that feels
like it starts to set I don't really
feel like I need a powder if I did put
on a powder I can see this getting even
heavier feeling it doesn't feel super
invisible to me like it's one of those
foundations that I definitely feel on my
face right now it doesn't feel too heavy
but with the powder I think it would
okay so we're gonna call the check-in
time 11:30 it is 11:30 for close enough
and I'm gonna do the rest of my makeup
and then I'll be right back
whoa
totally forgot highlight never said that
sentence in my life there we go alright
so it's no 1208 the rest of my makeup is
on obviously I do feel like it's
oxidized a tiny bit it could just be
what it looks like to me under these
lights but it does look a tiny bit
darker I do not apply setting powder but
I did set my face with my NYX dewy
finish I think spray it's doesn't alter
the finish of it it just sets my face
I'm gonna do the next check-in in
natural lighting so you guys can see
exactly how it looks in real lighting
not under giant ass studio lights so
let's talk about what is on the rest of
my face so contour I am super excited
about this this is actually the elf
eyebrow kit in the shade light and if
you're a pale princess this shade right
here to contour is amazeballs I'm
wearing it right now but I have a warmer
blush over top I showed you guys on
snapchat what it looks like just with
this alone blush I used over top is the
ultra blush in Sun glow this is their
matte no velvet blush highlight I'm
wearing this almost every day this month
this is amazing I love makeup goddess of
love I'm liking all these down below by
the way every single foundation Friday
video I tell you guys exactly what I'm
wearing earings
makeup everything is down below lips are
Oprah Staten Island I think I have a 30%
off discount code for you guys down
below and then almost everything on my
eyes is by caridy cosmetics I did a
whole video these are like Mac dupes I
did a whole like side-by-side comparison
one half my face Mac one half my face
carroty it is this video right here I'll
link it down below as well if you miss
it the only shade I used other than
Carrie was from the Urban Decay Naked
basics and I just used a little bit of
blackjack blackjack just to like blend
my crease a little bit I'll be back in a
few hours and natural lighting to check
in throughout the day also wanted to
quickly mention that I'm actually
vlogging today so if you want to see the
vlog from today's filming and everything
I kind of show you behind the scenes
like how I set up for filming how I curl
my hair all of that good stuff the blog
will be linked down below and in the
little eye thing right here because I'm
pretty sure it'll be up before this
video okay so it's not 351 so the
Foundation's been on for a little over
four hours and
and have this weird like burning on this
side of my nose yeah it's like super dry
and red I don't know if that is the
cells still have acid like burning a dry
spot or something but the rest of my
face looks good my forehead looks really
good
cheeks everything the only complaint is
crease lines right here and a tiny bit
around the nose but actually not as bad
as I thought my forehead looks really
nice it looks nice and skin light
doesn't look oily I think it has either
oxidized tiny bit or was a tiny bit too
dark to start because it looks normal
when you guys are sitting right here
because I've blended it down my neck but
if I back up and you can see my chest my
chest definitely is more pale than my
face right now but I don't think it
looks horrible I think I can get away
with this it doesn't look really Orange
II it just looks a tad dark right now I
honestly can't tell the difference
really between the sides all right so
that's no 8:04 p.m. so the Foundation's
been on for about eight and a half hours
I think I can't say the word foundation
today so turns out that this nose thing
that we had going on is actually a zit
literally right in the crack of my nose
thank you world so as far as how the
foundation looks it looks good
for being on for almost nine hours
without a powder looks really good my
only complaint is that the upper lip
area does not look good it looks super
Creasy and heavy on my upper lip I
definitely have a little bit of oil
coming through on my forehead but
nothing crazy I think it just looks a
little dewy skin like as far as this
side versus this side the only area
where this side of my face looks
different is right around here it looks
like it's starting to break down a
little bit right here whereas this side
looks really good so I would say if
you're someone who likes more matte
you'll probably like the original
formula better but again I didn't set
this with the powder so if you want to
make it matte just set it with powder
I will try playing around this I don't
think I really need to mix this with
anything because I do actually like the
shade 150 buff on me it's a little bit
dark but I like it because it gives me
warmth to my face without looking
and that's really hard to find it's a
little bit dark of a page I like the
finish of it by itself but because of
all the creasing and stuff I think I
would either use some kind of pore
primer to help the poor situation this
is new I'm pretty sure and I've been
using them for the past few days besides
today and it's the it cosmetics bye bye
pores primer this literally just like
blurs out your pores and I trust it
cosmetics with my first child their
products have never broken me out I feel
like their products actually like help
my skin and then I'll probably try this
with the powder I'm trying to think
which one I would even go for probably
the cover effects illuminating setting
powder I just don't feel like it needs
to powder ooh I feel like this
foundation mixed with a little bit of
the Urban Decay Naked would be really
good because it would give it just that
more like skin like effect I actually
don't have anything too horrible to say
about this one for once if you have a
more dry or normal skin obviously get
the other formula and try it out if your
oily than I am you might need to set
this one with powder more mature skin I
think there are better foundations out
there for you it might be worth giving
it a go but I think the Tarte rainforest
of the sea II on mature skin could be
really nice or just a more serum like
foundation but that is everything if you
guys liked this video and it was helpful
for you make sure you give it any thumbs
up you know eyes let me know down below
what foundation you want to see in
