happy foundation Friday if you're new
here this is why I do a first impression
video every single Friday on my channel
this kind of stemmed from fifteen days
of foundation so if you miss that I'm
gonna leave the place down below I did
15 days in a row of first impression
videos and we're doing it again November
5th to the 20th for today is the first
impression we're doing the wet and wild
coverall cream foundation and powder
this is one of the most requested
foundations lately I don't know why
since this has been out since literally
I think 2014 or 2013 this has been out
for forever it's just one of those
products that have never really thought
to try I don't know why it retails for
399 a lot of times you can get wet and
wild 40 percent off the drugstores
always switch out their sales so let's
read some of the claims on wet and wilds
website it says it has all day wear
medium to full coverage lightweight
satin matte finish visib right skin
perfecting complex reduces the
appearance of wrinkles and dark spots
brighten your skin well hydrating to
give a natural rejuvenating lift and I
do have combination skin with cystic
acne I usually get oily on my t-zone
throughout the day and I like more full
coverage since I do have acne and stuff
to cover up so it comes in six shades I
have the shade fair the lightest shade
alright so right here we have wet and
wild cover all and fair next to it is
L'Oreal True Match in c1 this is
maybelline fit me matte and poreless in
110 and this is Mac and w10 I also have
the shade fair in the powder let's take
a look at the powder too so the powder
actually comes in 8 shades I don't think
I've ever seen eight shades of this at
the drugstore I feel like there's
usually 3 on display like 3 or 4 but on
their website they have 8 shades and
this retails for $2.99 this literally
has the same exact claims as the
foundation on their website I don't know
if that's an error or what but it
literally says the exact same thing you
just say that this foundation is
supposed to apply best with their powder
obviously because they want you to
purchase both that mace we did try it
out with both today if you guys like
this video at any point you're excited
about foundation Friday make sure you
give it a thumbs up please let me know
down below what foundations you guys
want to see in the upcoming foundation
Friday's I purchase all the foundations
based on suggestions that you guys
comment and snap me and tweet me so let
me know you want
see my thoughts on this foundation and
how it applies and wears throughout the
day you're in the right place just keep
watching all right so have a little bit
different of a lighting situation right
now I got softbox lights and one of them
actually came broken so I only have one
right now and then I have my ring light
over here so let me know what you guys
think it's a lighting like this I
honestly have no idea how I'm gonna fit
freakin two softbox lights in this room
didn't really think that through these
things are huge who needs to live in the
room anyways anyways let's do makeup oh
 where'd the sponge good sponges
across the room literally just had a
catastrophe setting up this lighting
situation so I have the shade 8:15 fair
right here which is lightest shade and
I'm going to do half my face with the
brush and half my face with the Real
Techniques sponge like usual it's
actually looks kind of light I don't
know how much coverage we're going to
get with this I'm just going to start
out with about a dime-size amount have
some breakouts going on right here but
for the most part the rest of my face is
pretty clear I'm going to try the brush
on this side and see how well it covers
with all of this acne and stuff today
i'm using the morphe this one doesn't
have a number on it is from like forever
ago years ago okay I'm actually not
liking this brush right now it's giving
me some weird texture
I'm going to try this elf brush right
here this one is a bit smaller but I
love this brush for blending out
foundation it's definitely light enough
I already used up that full amount so
I'm going to add a tiny bit more with
one layer right now I would say we're
getting about a medium coverage it's
definitely not totally covering the acne
and stuff on one layer I'm feeling good
today I'm in a good mood it's actually
Labor Day right now when I'm filming
this so that's one layer with the brush
on this side when it go in with a sponge
and I'm starting with the diocese amount
again so I can see how far it goes with
a sponge I'm liking the shade of this so
I have them put out any more foundation
I'm still going the thing it goes a
little bit farther with a sponge still
huhhh product still little comparison
brush versus sponge ooh I actually think
I like how to applied with sponge
better making sure it's not just this
lighting it looks a little bit more
natural coverage with the sponge but the
finish of it just looks a lot smoother
I'm going to learn with a thin second
layer just on the parts that we need it
using the sponge and I did prime my face
I forgot to mention using the jouer anti
blemish primer my skin has been really
liking that stuff so I'm kind of scared
to use a different primer right now feel
like it's actually kind of helping my
acne a little bit okay now that I have
two layers on if you don't think it's
totally full coverage I think we got
about solid medium high medium you still
see some scarring and like freckles and
stuff coming through close up just so
you guys can see this is gonna be harder
to like turn down the lights now when I
do this these softbox lights so for the
rest of my face I'm actually going to be
filming a full face drugstore look but
I'm going to do the concealer and like
rest of my face products in this video
because I want to try out the wet and
wild cover all pressed powder in the
shade fair I have used this one time
before I feel like I didn't really
examine it so we're going to try this
again woah this light is frickin hot an
online it does say to set this
foundation with their powder so first I
want to go in with the Catrice liquid
camouflage high coverage concealer you
can get this at Ulta and I did a full
first impression video on this during 15
days of foundation with the Catrice a
all matte I think it's called Foundation
and I haven't really tried out this
concealer since then a lot so we're
going to try it again today it is light
enough which is awesome this is drying
pretty quickly and the finish of the
foundation without a powder it's
actually a setting this does feel like
one that I could get away without a
powder but I'm still going to set it
just to see how it works with the powder
I'm going to attempt to set my under
eyes with the elf HD perfect finish
powder never use this before it's
supposed to be really nice and for good
things basically just like a pressed
translucent powder
smells kinda minty usually don't like
using translucent powder to set my under
eye concealer because I feel like it
takes away some of the coverage looks
okay definitely not the most like full
coverage under-eye concealer but nothing
horrible now let's go in with the wet
and wild cover all powder in the shade
fair and I always like to pounce my
powder on my face rather than like
blending it because if you do that
you're just going to blend away some of
the coverage of the foundation we're
looking pretty matte the foundation
alone definitely has more of like a
satin finish which is actually really
nice you can see on my forehead and this
powder mattifies it a bit my face is
looking very textured right now
definitely looks like my makeup is
looking super textured on my forehead
channel a little bit I don't know how
I'm going to do this with these lights
because I can't dim the softbox okay I'm
gonna have to work on how I'm going to
do close-ups from now on with the
softbox but I'm going to do the next
check in in natural leggings it is now
11 a.m. pretty much I'm gonna go film
the other video and then I'll be right
back alright so it is now 11:40 the rest
of my makeup is on just wrapped up the
first impressions video on the rest of
my face products I'm going to call the
check-in time 11 o'clock since that's
when I wrapped up the face products but
I did end up setting my face which you
guys will see in that video with the
next dewy finish setting spray this
doesn't alter the finish of my face at
all I don't think it doesn't really make
it dewy
as you can see I still look pretty matte
unlike my forehead and stuff as far as
how the rest of the products went on on
top everything blended out really easily
no complaints it just looks like I'm
wearing foundation for sure
I wish I had a tiny bit more coverage to
cover up my acne but overall I really
like the shade of it both of these were
light enough I forgot to even talk about
the powder shade I like how the shade
looks on my skin I did want to mention
the formula a little bit more because I
feel like I didn't really touch on that
when I was actually applying it it has
kind of a gel like formula the way that
this goes on reminds me a little bit of
the Rimmel 25-hour foundation it feels
kind of gel like so I do think that if
you have dry skin this one might be okay
for you but
we'll see how it wears out the day so
alright so it's now 4:15 so the
Foundation's gone for a little over five
hours I have a post mate coming right
now to deliver Taco Bell I'm so addicted
to post mates and I'm funny so as far as
how the foundation looks it looks good
like I feel like it's gotten better
looking throughout the day so far
I do have creasing around my nose a
little bit and on my upper lip have you
seen any of my other videos that's
pretty much what happens with most
foundations especially if I'm putting a
powder on top which is why if I can find
a foundation I don't have to powder it
it's great because I don't usually get
as much creasing my forehead is starting
to look a little bit dewy I like it just
looks like skin doesn't look oily at
this point everywhere else
looks really nice I think it looks
really good in natural lighting got the
leopard robe on because I've just been
editing for the last five hours
literally so here's what everything's
looking like close up as you can see I
do have like a little bit of do coming
through on my forehead and then there's
the creasing I was talking about but
other than that I think it looks nice
alright so it's now 7:15 p.m. so the
foundation is gone for about 8 hours for
bang on for 8 hours
it looks pretty dang good definitely
gotten a little bit dewier as time has
gone on but I personally like that it
doesn't look super oily I feel like my
forehead and stuff definitely has a do
to it but it's more of a skin like do
not an oily do you know I'm saying my
only complaint is that it does look
pretty heavy around my nose area and
creasing under here and then also my lip
area which you saw earlier blush bronzer
highlight are still fully on this lip
liner though not a fan of the jcat liner
I used today it's definitely like
feathered a bunch and it's not fully
waterproof I think the foundation has
slightly oxidized a little bit I just
took a look in natural lighting there's
still some light and it looks like it's
darkened a tiny bit I like this one I
don't love it and I don't hate it
if it had a tiny bit more coverage I
would be all about it I'm trying to
think of a skin type that this wouldn't
work for and honestly I think that this
could work with dry skin just don't set
it with that powder
it feels pretty moisturizing and gel
like when it first goes on like I said I
get oily throughout the day typically
and I'm not a huge greaseball so I think
if you like medium coverage it's
probably worth trying this out since
it's only a few bucks both times I've
used the powder last time and today I
haven't been super wowed by the powder
that could just be because they don't
typically like super super mattifying
powders I like a powder that's gonna
look very skin-like when you put it on
but it also might just be the
foundations that I've tried to put this
on top of someone try using this powder
with other foundations and we'll see
what I think if you want to watch more
foundation Friday videos and we'll leave
the playlist down below I'm about to go
watch bachelor in paradise guilty blow
