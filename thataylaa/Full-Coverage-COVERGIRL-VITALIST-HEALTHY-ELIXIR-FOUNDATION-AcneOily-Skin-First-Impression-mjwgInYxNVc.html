foundation Friday feels so good to be
filming this so the first foundation
Friday since after my 15 days of
foundation series if you have no idea
what I'm talking about I'll link that
down below in the playlist but this is
where I do a new first impression video
every single Friday on my channel 6 p.m.
Pacific time so let's jump into it as
you can see we're doing something
different today I usually start off my
foundation videos with the full face of
makeup on I don't think that rooms
anything because it doesn't tell you
anything about the foundation and you
can also see how it looks in the Sun
nail but I get it I don't know if I'm
going to be doing this every single time
tation video but I just want to hear you
guys to feedback and see which one you
guys like more I really think it's about
95 degrees in my apartment right now I
don't have AC in this apartment because
welcome to Seattle so today I'm going to
be trying out the covergirl vitalist
healthy elixir foundation this is a
brand new foundation from covergirl I
have two lightest shades 710 this comes
in one fluid ounce which is standard for
foundations as SPF 20 in it which can be
nice for summer but it can cause
flashbacks sometimes and also it comes
in six shades I picked this up at
Walgreens and I'm pretty sure they had
more than six shades
alright so slash time just so you can
see some shade comparisons of the
lightest shades and different
foundations right here's the covergirl
vitalist foundation in 710 next over is
a covergirl clean matte BB cream and the
lightest shade as you can see these ones
are pretty similar clean my baby's one
of my favorite foundations for mixing to
keep me matte but obviously it's way too
dark Terry's derma file 208 which is a
great shade match for me tri rainforest
of the sea and porcelain and laura
geller cover lot foundation in porcelain
which is also really great shade so
reading some of the claims says it's a
vitamin infused formula with special
antioxidant complex finally a hydrating
formula for beautiful buildable coverage
that glides on smoothly flirt foot for a
flawless look luminous glow oil-free
lightweight formula minimizes the
appearance of oily shine I do have
combination skin I usually get oily
throughout the day but my to prep items
but I've been using for the last three
weeks time using these every single day
and I feel like it's really helped my
oil situation versus the Urban Decay
rehab makeup practices I used as like a
moisturizer and then as a primer I used
a hime light matte 12 primer this thing
rocks it stays together as what's on my
face right now I'm probably going to be
using these in all of my foundation
videos from here on out for a while
because I feel like this College
worse to my skin on the bottle it says
that it's supposed to be full coverage
says lightweight full coverage makeup I
love a good full coverage foundation so
let's try this thing out like normal and
one half of my face I'm use a foundation
brush the morphe 31 on the other half
and when you use a makeup sponge is by
morphe i've been in love with this
sponge it is amazing
I like the pointed top but I love using
the base to apply foundation packaging
is just kind of basic glass bottle but I
do love the gold and I like that they
have a pump on here so I'm start out
with a brush on this side of my face
this looks a little dark
covergirl foundations their lightest
shades are always too dark for me but
let's see how this one is whoa this is
scented man smells good it smells like
the dior star foundation almost whoo my
mirror is hella far away right now
shade definitely about three to four
shades too dark
yeah like I always say the shade doesn't
show up totally true to color on camera
but this is definitely about four shades
to dark really great coverage and it
looks very luminous and glowy which I
like I'm just gonna bring this pretty
much all the way down my neck right now
so it would have been a great day to
wear a turtleneck with a brush on that
one layer feel like I got full coverage
I'm loving the kind of radiant finish
right now it looks good on the center of
my forehead it's not clinging to all my
texture right there let's go ahead and
try it with the makeup sponge on the
other side I just love the way this
sponge feels I brought this when I was
traveling and used it almost every day
I'm loving how this is sitting on the
center of my forehead looks really plump
I think I got about the same kind of
coverage with a sponge I actually like
how it looks better on this side I think
it looks a little bit more lightweight
especially around the nose area but I
think this is one that you could go
sponge or brush I don't feel like I
really need a second layer besides me
looking like I just went to the frickin
Bahamas and only tans my face I think it
looks beautiful right now date wise I
would say this is about an NC 25 maybe
of 30 I don't understand how this is the
lightest shade of a foundation but
what's new I want to show you guys what
it looks like up close
I think it looks so nice especially look
on my forehead right now it's not
clinging anywhere looks good around my
nose area here's my chest color base
guess I'm not going outside today by the
way my necklace I'm freaking in love
with this is by Mallory Mallory 1712 her
jewelry lines
17:12 shop link it down below but I'm
just so proud of her and I think it's
beautiful so since this one is a very
dark on my skin and be super luminous I
do love the finish I think if this was
the right shade I don't think I would
set my face with a whole powder just
because I love the finish of it right
now but because of those two things I
think I'm going to set my face to powder
see if I can lighten it a little bit
right now it's 11:10 a.m. I'm going to
do the rest of my makeup and put on the
powder and things and I will be you
right back alright this now almost
exactly 11:30 so that's when we're going
to call the check-in time so I did end
up setting my face with a powder I used
where I just stood that is the cover
effect illuminating setting powder this
is one of the kind of four or five go-to
powders I always use this one I like to
use if I still want an illuminating
finish but I want to lighten my face a
little bit hotter went on really nicely
over the foundation the shade is
definitely still a few shades darker
blush that but as far as the finish and
everything right now I think it looks
beautiful still loving the coverage how
it's sitting on my skin how it feels it
feels pretty lightweight to me I feel
like I have a heavy coverage foundation
on I'm literally starting to Schmidt so
right now the thing I really like is the
center of my forehead it just looks
really great on any of my texture all
the products I used on the rest of my
face are always listed down below but to
contour I use the freedom makeup Pro
contour kit and medium the medium shade
right here works really well for me love
it blush I use makeup revolution candy
Queen of Hearts
baked blush right here highlight is elf
illuminating palette this white shade
right here as well uses the elf mad
format palette I just went in with this
cool tone shade right here in the crease
and then for the silver on my lid I use
Maybelline my silver so not my silver
and why silver have my lashes dentures
on which I have a whole video on and
then lips is the color pop club with I
love sriracha this is in the shade curvy
super pretty kind of natural kinky pink
color so right now besides the shade I
have no complaints about the foundation
love and how it looks and everything
next write an idea will be an Asha Lang
so you can see how it looks
it's like 85 degrees out and sunny right
now in Seattle I'm hoping I can get some
work done and then
get outside some point all right so it's
now 3:30 4:00 in the afternoons has been
on for about four hours I wanted to do
this check-in and now I usually do it at
like the five hour point but I feel like
my mouth is like slow-motion right now
so I'm going to go work out so I wanted
to do a check-in before I workout so you
can see what it looks like before I
sweat so I was just looking in the
mirror up close and it looks bomb you
guys it looks pretty much flawless I
mean I definitely look dewy as you can
see on my forehead and around my nose so
I'm hoping I don't get really really
oily by the end of the day I like how it
looks right now I think it just looks
very healthy but I feel like this is
almost like almost a serum foundation
but it doesn't have the feeling where
it's going to slide around or anything
it just looks beautiful it looks like
the shade matches me right now this
lighting let me see if I can actually
get accurate shade right now that's a
little better the shade is definitely
not showing up true to color when I look
in the mirror and it's lighting it's
like straight-up orange and then my skin
tone but here's what it looks like up
close it's not breaking down around my
nose I'm not getting upper lip creasing
like I usually do look at the center of
my forehead I just love how it looks on
my forehead just looks really smooth
right now I am in love with everything
besides the shade so I'm gonna go work
out I'm going to try and not totally
sweat off all this makeup but I guess
you guys will see how it holds up and
like sweating and warmth and summer
weather so I will check back in with you
guys at the end of the night all right
so it snow at 10:20 ISO foundations on
for almost 11 hours I've had this on all
day did some Jillian Michaels I was
full-on sweating and it stayed on
amazing after my workout it looked
really good right afterwards right now I
am pretty oily cinereous until my
forehead and around my nose it's not
overly oily this is just pretty normal
for me but the thing I like is that it's
not breaking down so even though it's
oily it's still fully holding up on the
side of my forehead and around my nose
my upper lip there's no creasing which
is really promising it looks really good
up until about the 8:00 or 9:00 hour
point and I think from there is when I
really start getting oily but I I love
it I love everything except the shade I
wish it actually came in a shade light
enough but I'm going to try and mix in
my white mixer and see side
and make it work because I love the
formula I think it's beautiful I think
this one could work for dry normal skin
the best of oily skin or combo skin like
I do you might need to play around
different powders and stuff to figure
out a combination
this one is a thumbs up for me if you've
tried foundation let me know what you
think of it down below I hope you guys
liked this video and are excited that
foundation Friday is back if you are

you guys thanks for watching see you my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
