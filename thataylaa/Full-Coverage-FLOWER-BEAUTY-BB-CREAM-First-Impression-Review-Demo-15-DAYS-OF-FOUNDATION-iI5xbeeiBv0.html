days of foundation I somehow managed to
get foundation inside my phone today we
can ignore the hair that desperately
needs to be washed I can think about
washing my hair let alone doing it right
now managed to shave half of my legs
today that was a success so I wanted to
share something super exciting with you
guys if you're in the Washington area or
you just want to make the trip up to
Seattle I'm doing a meet-up with Macy's
in Bellevue this Saturday April 22nd
from 3 to 6 p.m. I am so freaking
excited to meet you guys
if you can make it let me know down
below they read Oh meetup this is the
first Seattle local kind of meetup thing
I've ever done so it should be a good
time let's jump into the foundation so I
mentioned in yesterday's video at the
end that I was hoping that this product
would come in time I literally opened
the package right after I finished
filming that so I'm super excited to try
this out I've heard really good things
about this product it's just a flower
beauty BB cream flower beauty is Drew
Barrymore's makeup line every toes for
1298 and you get one fluid ounce of
product in here it's only comes in four
shades which I guess is kind of normal
for BB creams but I have the lightest
shade which is BB one I'm going to cert
swatches right here so you can see how
the shade compares to some of the other
lightest shades of foundation that I own
alright so swatch time right here is the
flower beauty BB cream in the lightest
shade BB one next to it is the derma Col
acne cover foundation this was
yesterday's video derma called 2:08
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless 110
Urban Decay Naked skin foundation in 0.5
and then I just watched these two
because I'm filming today's swatches the
same day as yesterday swatches again
this is a Max Factor pan stick
foundation in the shade 25 Sarah which I
told you guys I was going to pick up
next to it is 12 true beige so reading
some of the claims on Walmart it says
it's a primer foundation and concealer
in one formula
so that provides lightweight medium to
full coverage most BB Creams have about
light to medium coverage so if this has
more full coverage hell yeah the leo le
BB cream and the covergirl clean my BB
creams are one of my favorites both
those are too dark I just mix them but
it's as it covers imperfections visibly
minimizes pores evens out discoloration
helps eliminate unwanted shine I get
oily throughout the day I've combo skin
so if this helps keep me matte yeah
let's do it and this product is cruelty
free so if you've been enjoying 50 days
of foundation don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up tomorrow is the last
day crazy if you want to see what I
think of the flower Beauty BB cream and
how it applies somewhere throughout the
day you're in the right place just keep
watching alright so right now it is
10:40 we're going to be keeping this one
on late so I've already washed
moisturize in prime my face use my Laura
Mercier foundation primer on one half of
my face I think I'm used to Sigma f80
two round kabuki and on the other half
my Real Techniques sponge so this will
just super liquidy I'm going to give
this thing a good shake so it sounds
like it's solidifying a bit you
definitely have to shake this one
because now it's like a total solid what
if they have a thick consistency but
it's definitely more of like a creams
kind of peaking
looks pretty yellow alright let's try
the brush this shade is very yellow it
kind of dries into like a matte powdery
feel super quickly within about 10
seconds and I'm getting really good
coverage for a BB cream it's a brush I
would say it's about almost full
coverage and I like how it's sitting on
my skin super matte but it doesn't look
heavy or anything true test is the
forehead let's go in for the sponge on
this side it just looks like a matte
foundation as pretty good coverage it's
not totally covering my acne and stuff
on this one layer and I think I got a
bit better coverage with the brush Jade
looks a bit off to me I need a little
bit more pink in there so no I think we
got pretty close coverage on both sides
the sponge are just quicker and easier
so I kinda want to try doing a second
layer with this to see if it's buildable
we need a winner guys someone commented
that we haven't gotten a Helia
foundation yet we haven't it's weird so
on the second layer got up to full
coverage looks a tiny bit heavy for my
liking on the second layer but I like
the coverage that I got definitely
buildable it's looking a tiny bit
textured on the center
my forehead but nothing bad at all it's
not clinging anywhere on my dry patches
up here around my nose it looks really
good I'm pretty much liking everything
right now except the shade i chested
definitely much more pink than my face
right now it looks pretty yellow since
this one is matte and it says it's
supposed to last 12 hours I'm not going
to powder my face with this one
typically don't with products like this
10:50 let's just call the check-in time
11 o'clock so I'm gonna do the rest of
my makeup and I'll be right back okay so
it's now 11:08 everything blended out
super easily on top which I love it
looks really good no complains about how
it's sitting on my skin or anything
right now it just looks good so here's
what it looks like up close I think it
looks really nice and smooth covered
really well down here on all my acne I'm
liking it
comparing this to the covergirl clean
matte BB cream which is one of my
favorites that one's way too dark so I
have to mix it that product keeps me
really mad it just looks beautiful on
the skin I have a full review on that
soap it over here so it definitely has a
bit more coverage I like the way that
the covergirl one fits a little bit
better on my skin that one just looks
totally almost airbrushed in a way too
super lightweight but this one I'm still
liking right now so we'll see did super
minimal makeup which is that kind of day
so for bronzer I used a number 7 golden
sands bronzer blend it out super easily
for blush I use my favorite Max Factor
nude Moz highlight what I used hourglass
ambient light ethereal light lighting
powder what the light does a lot of
lights this is what I use if I just want
a super subtle kind of natural highlight
mascara will be down below my usual and
then lips was morphe virgin liquid
lipstick then I put the butter LONDON
butter cream gloss over top this is
super sticky but I like the minty feel
to it and its really pretty color so
check-in time is 11 o'clock the next
check and I do will be in natural
lighting I have a ton of editing to
do today so here we go I'll see you guys
in a few hours so right now it's 4:08
I'm like 99% sure the check-in time was
11 o'clock so it's been on for about 5
hours and it looks good guys is wearing
really well I'm gonna zoom in I don't
have a ton of oil coming through yet it
looks good on the center of my forehead
I didn't have sunglasses on for a little
bit
took an editing break to be in a sense a
little bit so it has worn off a little
bit where my glasses work but my upper
lip and around my nose I feel like looks
pretty good it's a tiny bit taken up
right there but I usually get that this
is
good in comparison and everywhere else
it just looks good chin looks pretty
good right now
so still no complaints at this point
this is a good sign fingers crossed I
like it by the end of the night here the
colors a bit more accurate as you can
see it's dark and very yellow I would
need to mix in something a tiny bit
lighter and a tiny bit Pinker all right
so it's now 9 o'clock so if foundation
has been on for 10 hours since I last
saw you guys I managed to still spray
all over my face and down my shirt and
also managed to splash water on the top
of my face as I was filling up to cure
eggs just how the day is going but with
that being said it's looking pretty dang
good overall I think my forehead looks a
bit oily Wednesday it kept me as matte
at the covergirl clean matte BB cream
but I still really like the way it looks
I think it just looks oily but it's not
separating I feel like if the shade was
right I would like this 20 times better
so just keeping that in mind I actually
do like how my face is looking for me it
looks pretty good around my nose and
upper lip area came off a little bit
where I still spray it all over my face
so what's happening to my butt from
staring at a computer all day
definitely oily but it's not separating
so that's crossing and again this is
without a powder so for me just because
of the shade of this one I wouldn't wear
it by itself if it wasn't for the shade
I would totally wear this again and I
would wear by itself so I don't have to
play around with this and definitely
makes it a foundation with lighter and
more pink at the end of the series I do
a wrap up video that video is going up
about a week after day 15 have been
filming these for weeks now so I have
been trying out different combinations
in between these videos going up but if
one of the four shades of this match you
and you like more of a matte foundation
it's definitely matte up until about six
hour point that's when I started getting
a little bit more dewy so if you like
higher coverage more matte I think you
might like this it hasn't settled into
any of my lines it didn't claim weird on
any dry patches or anything so overall
this one is a thumbs up for me
stop giving away my ranking at this
point this was definitely up there so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video
hell yeah for finally having a decent
foundation love you guys thanks for
watching see you tomorrow in day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
