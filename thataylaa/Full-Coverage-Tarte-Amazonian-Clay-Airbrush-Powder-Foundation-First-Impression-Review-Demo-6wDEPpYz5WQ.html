consider that
all right so today it is foundation
Friday this is the first foundation
video we're back after 15 days of
foundation I do foundation Friday every
single Friday on my channel and a whole
playlist with all the other foundation
Friday videos so I will link that down
below but today we're talking about a
powder foundation which is a little bit
different this is the Tarte Amazonian
clay full coverage airbrush foundation
this is one of the products that has
been on my to buy list for literally
years like senses came out pretty much I
have tried the Tarte Amazonian clay
liquid foundation I think I have a super
old probably super embarrassing video on
it let me know if you'd want to see that
again because I feel like I mean
remember what I saw the minute I don't
think I liked it but we could dry it out
again and see how it goes but this is a
recipe full coverage I'm into it so this
product comes in 16 shades I have the
shades fair honey which has fair skin
with peach undertones this is the
lightest shade as far as retails for $36
and you get zero point two four seven
ounces of product in here just for
comparison laura geller double take base
powder foundation has 0.35 ounces of
product and a cosmetic celebration
foundation illumination has their point
three ounces of product this one does
have a little bit less product in it is
the loose powder of both of these are
pressed powder foundations so I'm on
ulties website right now let's read some
of the claims okay what the substance
use with light reflecting gemstones so
this is vegan supposed to be waterproof
it says it's a full coverage weightless
powder formula that's offered in a wide
range flow bla lasts for 12 hours it has
a bunch of different things and it has
Amazonian clay tourmaline pearl powder
camellia leaf extract so you guys will
see this in the demo but the mesh
delivery system that they're talking
about is this actually has this kind of
cupped area right here and then there's
a little mesh thing right here when you
just press the brush into versus a
normal loose powder where you have to
kind of cap it out put it into the lid
or something so I thought that was
really cool I also really liked how they
have this in the lid which I don't know
if you guys can see this but it has this
little thing sticking out so when you
actually screw on the lid it's pressing
against the mesh thing so if you're
traveling or if you drop this or
something you're not going to get a ton
of powder falling out into lid or
anything so I do appreciate the package
design on this a combination skin with
this big acting my skin has been acting
up again
who knows usually get pretty oily
throughout the day on my t-zone if
you're excited to have foundation Friday
starting up again give this video a
thumbs up so I know just want to see how
the Tarte Amazonian clay airbrush powder
foundation applies and wears throughout
the day you're in the right place just
keep watching what coffee just literally
almost build everywhere oh man oh man
create it together do this because it's
9:30 right now I've had an interesting
morning I don't even know what I'm
wearing all my makeup is completely
packed away right now
so luckily I was able to dig out this
foundation for today's video what is
going on
what is going on right now so I've
already washed moisturize prime my face
I use my Joey anti blemish matte primer
like usual and since this is a powder
foundation I am going to spot conceal
first just because with any powder
foundation I would definitely spot two
seals first if you don't have acne and
scarring and stuff to cover up you
obviously wouldn't need to do this so
two spot conceal even use my wet and
wild come correct celebrity concealer
and then for under my eyes gonna use my
Tarte shape tape we're going in with a
powder you want to put on all of your
liquid cream products first you don't
want to put any kind of liquids on top
of powder afterwards or you just going
to get really weird texture going on I
rarely rarely use powder foundations
that you actually usually use them to
set my makeup just because they
typically give you a little bit more
coverage than just a setting powder
that's we having a damn good skin day to
just be able to wear powder foundation
usually say cosmetic celebration
foundation illumination actually does
give you pretty good coverage alone if
you kind of layer it up a little bit but
typically I do prefer a liquid
foundation on my skin this wet and wild
concealer is insane you need like the
tiniest tiniest bit and it covers
everything I'm actually just going to
use my finger to kind of tap it in and
you will still be able to see how the
powder cover is because my skin is
nowhere near flawless even with spot
concealing okay so I think that's all
the spot concealing we're going to do
I'm going to turn it down a little bit
so hopefully you can see all this but I
still do have definitely scarring and
just unevenness that I need to cover up
with the powder hopefully here's
packaging pretty
kind of frosted glasses and definitely
plastic but looks like less so the cool
thing about this is that it has this
little mesh thing and pretty sure what
you do is just press your brush in there
and actually picks up the amount so you
don't have to like tap it out or
anything like with loose powders so I
have a few different brush options I'm
going to try the first one is the morphe
e 44 this is what i usually use for
powder if i want more coverage like this
is what i use with my Laura Geller and
Maya Cosmetics powders I might try to
flimsier one this is the e one this one
is good for more of like buffing this
one you can't do a whole lot of buffing
with just because it is stiffer and then
I also might try my Coastal Scents BR
one ten brush this is technically not a
powder brush but I use it for setting
powder I do really like this one too or
I feel like this gives me really good
coverage with powders I might try this
online it says you're supposed to start
from the center of your face and buff
outwards since I put that concealer on
I'm going to first kind of press the
powder in and then try and do some
blending but I just go in and buff right
now I just don't think I'm going to get
a whole lot of coverage but we'll see so
I'm gonna start with the e 44 I think on
this side of my face whoo that's cool so
you just press it right in there and it
just picks up the product for you why
doesn't every loose powder have fish
looks contagious alright so let's see so
I'm gonna first I think kind of stipple
this one
when I'm buffing down here on my neck to
cover up the heat rush and Mack you down
here it isn't covering a whole lot okay
it's just covered the redness on my nose
really well I'm going to try this 110
brush on my forehead I think I think I
definitely like the first one better so
I just want to stipple this on first so
I'm not blending away any of the
concealer and then I think I'm gonna go
a little bit more in buff I mean I am
getting some coverage for sure doesn't
it look totally full covered right now
looks like about low medium coverage I
would say which is pretty good for
powders I'm going to take that really
big brush that you want on this side and
just tell you what happens I really like
this little mesh thing this is super
cool whew okay wait hold up I think it
might actually like the less dense brush
a little bit better I just covered
pretty well this might be like the bare
minerals foundation where you do have to
like buff it to get the coverage it
isn't totally full coverage you can
definitely still see stuff coming
through I don't really like the way it's
looking on my forehead right now a
little bit textured on my forehead but
that could have just been brush I use so
I'm gonna try and go in and bus
everything again with a little bit more
product this side of my face is looking
really nice I do like this side better
right now then this side this one is
looking actually a little bit heavy I
don't know if you guys will be able to
see this but you can actually see pores
right here which is kind of weird so it
sounds a little bit more on the e-1
brush and I think this time I'm just
going to like buff hope that I not rub
off concealer shade wise I think this is
actually working it doesn't oxidize I
actually think this matches pretty well
I do have a lot of texture on my
forehead right now so I don't think it's
totally the product I have a lot of like
tiny bumps coming in I think one of the
products during 15 days a foundation
like totally wrecked my skin I have a
ton of under the skin little white
things still not getting very good
coverage down here I think it looks like
solid medium coverage it feels very
lightweight obviously it's a powder it
doesn't feel like I really haven't
anything on I think it layers sign it
doesn't look cakey or anything really
anywhere and tell you off the bat just
with the application and coverage and
everything I probably wouldn't use this
again by itself even with spots and
feeling just because it doesn't look
quite as flawless as I usually like even
if I wanted something quick I think it
would just be easier to go in with the
liquid foundation or stick foundation
really quite it could be good for
actually using to set your foundation
which is definitely how I'll try it next
time it actually doesn't have a totally
matte finish which I really like it does
have a little bit of a satin finish to
it you can kind of see you light and
flushing off my face a little bit which
I love I think it makes you look more
like skin so this could be really nice
as a setting powder actually so goes my
stargazer powder to set the under eyes
so it is now nine fifty-nine ten o'clock
we're calling at reckon time kind of
o'clock I'm going to go do the rest my
makeup like I said everything is packed
away so I'm just going to do something
super super basic today okay so it's now
at 10:20 the rest of my makeup is on
less roads are highly blended out
totally fine on top and we know taupe
putting powder on top of powder I walked
out of this room and looked in bathroom
lighting and I actually really liked the
shade of this an extra can idea will be
a natural line so we can see how it
looks then but right now it's looking
really nice I really have no complaints
right now I did use a setting powder on
the setting powder I did use a setting
spray on the rest of my face I use the
elf makeup mist inside and I feel like
that kind of took it to the next level
it kind of just settled everything on my
face and it looks really nice now if
you're using any kind of powder
foundation I would say you definitely
want to set your face just so it's not
moving around throughout the day or
anything I'm addicted to setting spray
use them every day regardless but on the
rest of my face I use the mask baby
don't go blush blush this will use in
the bronzer wet and wild color icon
mellow wine blush elf illuminating
palette the shade right here is what my
highlight is and then my eyes are the
modern renaissance palette I just used
golden ochre and raw Sienna from this
palette but star Rimmel 7/10 first class
news and then I just topped it with the
anastasia
butterscotch lip gloss so everything yes
so that's everything on my face i second
I do like I said will be a natural
lighting I'll see you guys in a few
hours
okay this now four o'clock I'm currently
a dumb thing to get a post mate right
now
right now - a burger every postmates is
currently taken so if foundation has
been on for six hours at this point I
was originally planning on checking in
at two but I ended up being out I just
got home a little bit ago
so let's take a look for bang on for 6
hours it looks friggin awesome right now
the blinding isn't really doing it
justice and has a weird kitchen light
right there and there's not a whole lot
of natural light coming in right now but
hopefully you guys can see what it looks
like in the Hobby Lobby lighting in the
bathroom and in you know on that I all
really have 5000 years it looked really
nice super smooth it looks a little bit
textured on my forehead but again that's
just kind of my forehead right now it
looks really nice around my nose I think
for six hours it's looking pretty good
I'm going to edit get some work done and
then I'll check back to you guys at the
end of the night hopefully I will have
found a burger
alright so it's now 956 so the
Foundation's been on for almost exactly
12 hours just as this foundation is
supposed to last 12 hours so first off
oil wise I think it looks really good
just controls my oil really well for
this looks a little bit dewy but nothing
crazy oily like I can get sometimes I'm
getting some major separation on my chin
and also on my forehead if you weren't
this close to my face I don't think you
could really tell up a lot but it does
look a little bit heavy around my nose
area separation on my chin and my
forehead like I said but with that being
said for being a powder foundation I
feel like this lasted really well
throughout the day it stayed on for the
most part kind of concluding shots if
you're someone who likes powder
foundations I think this one it might be
worth giving a go if you have dry skin
powder foundation probably isn't the
best for you I would say this is more
for normal to oily for me I probably
won't use this by itself again but I
definitely want to try setting my
foundations with this because I really
like the shade of it I think it'll be
just the right amount of coverage on top
of foundation or it just gives you that
little something extra so I'm going to
keep playing around with this one I
think this will just be on those
products but totally depends on if you
like powder foundations so update
because I know you just can't wait to
know I did get a burger it was amazing
so I'm going to go take off my makeup
put on a face mask finish it
