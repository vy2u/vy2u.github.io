brows on all right so today we have a
shadow inch mousse on look I'm wearing
right now I guess this is my version of
like a spring look I'm feeling the bold
lower lash line lately and a lot of the
products I used in today's video are
from glambot if you guys have been
watching my videos you know that I am in
love with clay and bi it's basically a
site where you can buy and sell pre
loved makeup
protip sign up for their email list
because it will basically notify you as
soon as a sale goes on you hop on right
when you get that email that's when you
can snag the really good deals most of
stuff that I got was like 60 to 80
percent off so super good deals if
you're interested in trying out
different kinds of high-end makeup but
you don't want to pay the full price tag
if at any point you want to check out
glam bought it I will have a 30% off
link in the description box down below
also unto let you guys know that I will
be having a ton of foundation reviews
coming up I post on Instagram the other
day asking which one you guys want to
see first so I'm gonna be doing this
Sephora airbrush foundation and also I
just bought the Charlotte Tilbury magic
foundation so if you want to see those
videos make sure you subscribe so you
get notified when they're up so if you
want to see how I got this look you're
in the right place just keep watching
all right so ready washed right what was
that word ready wash moisturized and
primed my face it is first thing in the
morning right now third cup of coffee so
I'm feeling like using the Too Faced
Born This Way Foundation just because I
don't have to mix this show you this is
in the shade snow and it has pretty good
coverage a whole foundation review on
this foundation I'm just gonna go in
with my pure cosmetic sponge and
hallelujah pur cosmetics answered our
makeup prayers and they're now selling
this sponge by itself before you could
only buy it with the Cameo contour stick
they're selling it separately now which
is amazing because this is like one of
my favorite makeup sponges are selling
it for $12 which is such a good deal for
the quality of the sponge way cheaper
than the Beauty Blender a little bit
more expensive than the Real Techniques
sponge I do love the Real Techniques
sponge but I feel like the
is a little bit better quality it hasn't
like torn or ripped at all it's in
really good shape I do usually have to
go in with two layers of this foundation
to get the kind of coverage I why but
the finish is just really nice I do have
to set it and if you're just stumbling
across this video and you haven't seen
any of my videos before I have cystic
acne clearly combo skin have a ton of
full coverage foundation videos cell
links my peel skin and foundation
playlist down below but hey join the
baby toe family and subscribe cuz they
look really cute right now okay so
here's the coverage I get with about one
and a half layers pretty good you can
still see some of my acne peaking
through but I can go in with concealer
and fix that this is my favorite
collection Cosmetics concealer that I
mentioned 5000 times now I thought about
like splitting up my face makeup in
these videos like when I do shadow and
Tomatoes kind of things because it just
takes forever and I feel like it could
be a whole video just about my face
products I'm gonna know if you guys like
seeing an all-in-one kind of thing I
just put my concealer down the center of
my face too to lighten it a little bit I
woke up with two Draenor Mo's it's right
in the center of my face so awesome day
to film what are you gonna do to show
must go on sending that with stargazer
and look how much that just helps to
brighten in the same just set the rest
of my face I'm going in with a cosmetics
celebration foundation illumination and
some of my favorite foundation powders
if you like doing foundations it sets
everything without like fully mattifying
and taking away that glow you have going
on I've been really feeling like the
bronzer lately and I'm excited to try
this out I got this off a glam buy this
will be a cosmetics vitality glow
anti-aging matte bronzer how the bronzer
anti-aging you can really enter like the
red tone bronzers and I'm hoping this is
like what I'm thinking in my head it
looks like it might be a really nice
shape
I think I got this we're like under $10
I'm glambot oh yeah it's gonna be pretty
I know why I'm usually not into like
bronzer contour anything at all but I'm
not we could use a pretty light hand
with this like I haven't given it a good
swirl in here and a blush I'm using is
the morphe for this is one of my
favorite contour oh I should film that
video this weekend people do that
tomorrow I really need to film my
favorite brushes video Tolu you guys
have been asking for that you'll do that
after this highlight you want to take
the Too Faced candlelight highlight I've
never tried this this was also from
limbo and it looks like a really nice
pale e shade so let's see this is like
one of those highlighters that came out
a long time ago like years ago and I've
always been wanting to try I just never
have looks like it has a little bit of
glitter in it so questionable so let's
see not a whole lot of pigment to it
like I'm having to load this on do is
that one cheek that always applies
highlight better I think it's like the
angle that your hand applies it it is 80
degrees out right now in Seattle so this
is really hard to be filming right now
I'm gonna film a few videos get them
ready to go for the week and then go
outside I feel like I freaking scored
because I found this on glambot this is
the hourglass radiant magenta in the
uplighting blush actually haven't tried
any of the hourglass products like I
haven't tried their normal highlighting
powders I haven't tried their blushes I
don't know how whoo
it's actually pretty pigmented don't
think those may be that big dude am I
going with my favorite microphone brush
and blend oh my god it feels so good
this is the morphe 41 Oh brows usually
do that before all that I guess I'll
show you guys brows today because why
not I've been really liking the color
pop brow pencil I mentioned this in my
raves and rejects video this month
I like to add a little bit of roundness
to the top does anyone actually enjoy
putting my brows on I'm a down below if
you enjoy doing your brows like it's
just like the chore doing my brows is
like right up there with folding laundry
okay so then I go in with a brow gel
this is the old abroad you'll use this
every single day love it
this is in the shade dark brown I just
really like the shade of this I think I
got it the LA based in nude zero three
from Lancome off the bloom but this is
just a shadow base and who feels really
nice and creamy actually it looks a
little bit dark but we're gonna be
putting shadows so it's fine bring this
all the way up to the brow bone and also
I'm gonna put a little bit of this
underneath my eye because I'm gonna be
blending some major pink eyeshadow down
there I feeling like a really springy
pink look I don't think I've done a pink
look like ever thank you guys for all
the super positive feedback on the
yellow eyeshadow video that was like one
of those ones where I was like this
could either go really well or really
not well and I'm glad you guys really
liked it so I have a ton of new makeup
geek shadows am super excited cuz I've
heard so much good things about them I
have tried like a few of their shadows
before with the classics the really nice
quality I'm super affordable I'm going
in with Peach Smoothie right now which
is a really nice transition shade think
I'm gonna keep the top lid pretty
neutral and then put like a pop of pink
on the bottom blending out super nicely
on top of this base I got this the big
beautiful eyes eye contour kit from
benefit off of glam by I don't know if
that was supposed to be it's like a
cream oh is this a primer oh it's a
concealer this is their Boeing concealer
it's in the shade - so a little bit too
dark for me there's this really nice
like bronzy topi shade that I think I'm
gonna use so I think I'm just gonna go
in with my finger and pluck this all
over the lid this has a really nice
Sheen to it this is like one of those
shadows if you've had tan skin this
would look so pretty in the summer I
don't think I've tried any of the
benefits eyeshadows not I think about it
but I'm just blowing that right up to
the Peach Smoothie shade next
I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do I think
I'm gonna take that light pink shape
that right on the inner corner a little
bit super pretty actually I'm going to
come back to the top I kind of don't
want to add a whole lot of like
definition in the crease or anything I
kind of just want to leave it like this
but I'm gonna do the bottom lashline
first and then see if we need to kind of
even it out on the top so I'm going to
do a bright ass pink this is the color
pop liner and yep color pops eyeliners
are super nice and they're retractable
Emily does glide on the waterline so
easy like look at that I wish I could
zoom you guys any more but I can't I
think I'm also going to bring this down
a little - Sara is kind of like a base
for the shadow that we're gonna blend on
top I'm gonna focus this mostly hmmm
outer half maybe yeah
then I'm going to take this morphe like
a neon palette look how exciting this
looks this is the 12 P and I haven't
used this yet I'm gonna take this pink
fuchsia shade and just blend that right
on top maybe they don't add eyeliner to
the top I can I just want to do like a
springy lash usually like to put on my
scared before false lashes just because
then you don't have to coat your lashes
with mascara afterwards I know actually
like full-on put on mascara when I do
this I just literally coat the lashes
okay I feel like I need a little
something something in the bottom inner
corner for the inner corner just take a
highlight you have I'm just taking Becca
shimmering skin perfecter and I'm just
gonna put some of that on the bottom
inner corner maybe the top we'll see
just to add like a little bit of
brightness and freshness okay yeah also
bring this on the inner fire a little
bit both lashes so instead we going with
socialised siren lashes this is the
Chrissa
Chrissa pikas bukas Krista made these
said they're beautiful these are the
siren lashes and I'm just going in with
that and the kiss lash blue oh yeah
beyond these when I apply laches I just
use my finger I think it's easier than
tweezers I usually plop it down right in
the middle and let the outer edge fully
set and then put down the front parts
right now the front part is just like
chillin plop it down okay I'm gonna go
in some buy mascara they kind of don't
want to do this but I always feel weird
not having anything on my bottom lashes
so I hope it doesn't room like the pink
thing we have going on but I'm just
gonna put a super super light layer of
mascara like barely touching to my
lashes like I need a little bit more
highlight so I'm just going to go in
with the showing skin Perfector there we
go and now onto lipstick I'm trying out
the cap on D at lipstick that I got off
a gland by its looks brand new I don't
think this was ever used unless they did
like a really good job of topping off
the top part but this looks like
literally brand new in backstage Bambi
but on the liner with this probably I'm
gonna take this color pop liner and I
love this Oh fully out awesome it's
really hard to stay in frame want to do
this that way all right lips are lined
lookin real key right now so I'm gonna
go on the Kat Von D lipstick oh yeah I'm
gonna go back with the liner to blend
the corners alright so this is the final
