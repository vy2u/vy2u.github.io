right now it is 10:00 in the morning
all right so today I'm going to be doing
a look this book right here
I found a ton of good products on
glambot I'm using a bunch of them in
this video super excited about it
because I got to try out the Kat Von D
metal matte eyeshadow palette this thing
is giant and there's eyelash glue to it
also found the Anastasia contour kit you
haven't heard of glambot they're
basically where you can buy and sell
pre-owned makeup I'm addicted to it
since some of the products that you get
are generally used they have a whole
sanitation process makeup can be
sanitized just as it is at makeup
counters in malls and stuff I like how
they seal everything with like the
glambot sticker so you know it's been
sanitized and it doesn't feel like
you're getting pre-owned makeup they do
like crazy 40% off 80% off sales and
they do have a Black Friday sale coming
up so make sure you're signed up for
their email newsletters that will alert
you anytime a sale goes on stuff
disappears really quick off of glambot
so you want to be on there like right
when it goes up I love glam but I've
shopped in there for years so thank you
to glam bog for collaborating with me on
this video glambot hooked you guys up
with a 30% off code it's Taylor 30 I'm
gonna leave a link down below I wanted
to quickly remind you guys that there's
not going to be a foundation Friday this
week or next week because I am in the
middle of filming for 15 days foundation
November 5th
is the first day of 15 days of
foundation make sure you're following me
on all of my social channels because I
announce anything that's going on there
Instagram snapchat Facebook Twitter love
them all if you want to see how I got
this look you're in the right place just
keep watching okay so my base is on
because I'm filming a first impression
on the Jolie stick foundation that video
will be out before this I'm going to
link that down below if you missed it
this is a foundation Friday video what
is it my eyeball we're going to try this
amazing cosmetics amazing concealer
illuminate in the shade ivory this is
supposed to be like an illuminating
under-eye concealer which always kind of
confuses me because if you have to set
it with a powder doesn't that just take
it away I'm not sure if we're going to
set my face with a powder yet disclaimer
my foundation is 50 shades too dark
right now what you saw if you watch that
video so this concealer will probably
look extra light right now but let's
just blend this is my morphe G 38 brush
I love this for concealer
oh this is looking a little bit dry whoo
my undereyes might just be dry right now
but it's looking pretty crackly
hopefully you guys can't hear the
construction going on right now outside
I don't know what they're doing but I
walked in my kitchen the other day first
thing in the morning and there was a
dude standing out on one of those oyster
things literally right outside my
kitchen just staring in this one
normally I would highlight the center of
my face and stuff but since we're doing
a first impression on this foundation I
want to see the foundation without
concealer on top of it everywhere so I'm
just going to leave the concealer to
that I'm going to set my under eyes with
my position formula translucent light
setting powder I'm out of stargazer so
I've been going back to using this
because I have like three backups of
this but I think I like stargazer a
little bit better okay so the foundation
feels like it's starting to set now I
don't think I'm going to powder my whole
face because I love the finish of this
right now so I'm just going to go in for
kind of undo eyes first and then we'll
go in with bronzer and stuff switching
it up today switching it up so for an
eyeshadow base I'm going with the
Lancome love ace nude zero three that
just reminded me of school of rock for
some reason got this off a bland bought
a while ago and I really like this as an
eyeshadow base pretty similar to the Mac
Paint Pot I was supposed to have a
meeting today that got rescheduled to
the morning and I'm really glad because
I was planning on trying out this
foundation before going in what it
walked in like Snooki I am so friggin
excited to try out this palette this is
the Kat Von D metal matte so it says
metal and then if you flip it it says
matte how cool is that I just think that
super cool product design right there
see if I can get this out of the box to
start so this palette is huge like this
is a super large palette I don't think
you would ever want to travel with this
this is definitely the biggest palette
that I own there are nine and shimmery
shades and then thirteen matte shades if
I just kind of correctly this is what
they all look like super pretty I feel
like there's a really nice array of
different colors in here I think I want
to go for like a forest emerald kind of
green look I don't think I've ever done
a green
look at my channel so I'm gonna start
out and take the shade suede which is a
really nice pale transition shade the
only Kat Von D eyeshadows I have ever
used a fret about brows alright we'll do
that after this the only Kat Von D
eyeshadows I've ever used is the shade
and light palette and I wasn't a huge
fan of that palette I just feel like
they're almost too powdery and I just
kicked up a lot my under Ed's eye
looking very bright today okay so let's
do brows because this is gonna drive me
crazy lately I've been going in with a
Ulta deep brown tint this is only if I'm
doing a shadow by the way on an everyday
basis I just leave my brows but this is
the older Bratten I used to always use
this stuff and I've just been going in
to add a little bit of color basically
back into my brows sometimes when I put
on foundation it like covers up the
permanent brows a little bit you could
just use makeup remover but this is just
as easy and then to kind of clean up the
edges a little bit I go in with my Mac
Paint Pot no my Mac fluidline in past
Twilight this I'm pretty sure was a
limited edition from like years ago when
I had red hair I really like this for my
brows has like more of a purpley 10 and
I like my brows darker than my hair
obviously now back on diet shadow I
can't get over how giant this thing is
it's taking up half my table right now
so we just took suede right here now I'm
going to go in with this shade oak and
I'm just going to blend that boom maybe
we'll do like a purpley green that's a
little too Barney esque okay I'm going
to take that shade oak and put that on
like the outer third well these are
super pigmented by the way I can't
believe I found this thing literally
brand new on glambot it looked like it
had literally been swatch like maybe one
or two times and even been used it all
looked like and it was fully in its box
this is super super pigmented I'm going
back in with the m5 lovin brush and just
blending that together a little bit oh
man look at tinsel they look so pretty
this is the shade wat ooh
heck yeah but then we also have this
matte green this is moss I think I'm
first going to go in with moss and
brush so on the stiffer brushes to the
m5 19 I'm gonna take moss which is that
matte green shade I think I'm gonna kind
of like blend this into the crease a
little bit I don't know
we'll find out though I never put colors
in my crease I realized the other day
trying to expand the horizon that looks
a little bit muddy this is not the
softest brush so I'm going to be putting
that shimmery green shade on my lid so
it's okay if this is like all over your
lid in places that you don't want it
we're just focusing it on blending into
the crease right now yeah this brush is
like friggin scratchy would not
recommend so when this video is going up
I think Kendall will be coming in like a
couple days Kendall Rae is coming to
visit I am super excited she's staying
with me here in Seattle if you guys want
to follow along that we will be posting
on snapchat and everything she'll
probably be vlogging but I think we're
going to try and film some kind of video
together whether it's like a challenge
video or I don't know let us know what
you want to see down below now we are
going in for the fun part I'm going to
take what which is that emerald kind of
tee gold color and put that on oh heck
yeah do you see that this is what the
brush - usually I don't get that bit of
pigment with a brush but this looks
freaking beautiful for being a shimmery
eyeshadow this has pretty much no
Fallout I'm going to take that hour 39
brush and just blend a little bit this
shade is so frickin pretty I'm going to
take it on my finger and just see what
happens a little bit more shimmery with
your finger but feel like it's pretty
close to the brush I'm gonna go in with
tinsel this looks like urban decay Verve
a little bit I'm going to apply this
right on the center of the eye
this one has some follow just felt it
land on my cheek I'm gonna spray the
brush so we get a little bit more color
and it doesn't fall out what the shadow
is beautiful on the lower lash line I'm
going to go back in with moss which is
the matte green shade still want like a
major pop of green I'm going to take
suede that transition color with frits
use just to blend this out a little bit
and I'm going to see if I have a bright
green eyeliner
his I'm into the screen right now we are
in luck I have this Lancome one which is
Pacific and then I also have the color
pop key spoon this looks like true green
so I think I'm going to go in with this
I'm going to bring this a tiny bit
underneath the lower lash line to give a
little bit more pop now we're talking
for an inner corner highlight I'm
actually gonna take this makeup
revolution shimmer brick radiant I think
we're going to use this as a face
highlight too if never tried this before
I'm just going to apply some of this to
the inner corner whoa that's intense for
eyeliner I want to try this L'Oreal
voluminous liner noir this is from the
renewed like feeling this all the
feeling collection or something yeah
feline or also have their mascara here
try actually before I do liner and
lashes and all that good stuff I want to
do the rest of my face that I can spray
it with a setting spray super exciting I
finally have the Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour kit I found this off of glambot
hell yeah this isn't a shade light to
medium look at this this is literally
untouched this looks brand-new so
there's a banana shade in here that I
actually might use because I feel like
my under eyes are too light right now so
I think first I'm going to go in with
this banana shade and just add a little
bit I don't think I've ever used a
banana shade in my life because they're
usually like yellow on my skin too so
I'm going to try this shade right here
this middle shade to contour and by the
way my face right now is pretty much
fully set alright it's actually a really
nice kind of subtle not subtle but
natural ish shade what are we doing for
highlight this one looks pretty intense
here are my options right now we can do
the makeup revolution one that I just
used as eye shadow could do this jku
glow girl this is on their new
highlighters or I have the cutest thing
I've ever seen in my entire life
this is a mini mary loumanizer glambot
threw this in as like one of their
freebie things they usually put in some
kind of samples or little small size
makeup in with your order I feel like
this is a boardgame piece or something
so I might use mary loumanizer
I'm use it in a while so cute okay okay
this looks way better than the Marylou
that I own maybe I got a dud because I
never understand what the hype is with
Mary Lou but this one looks way less
glittery than the one that I own
interesting
I need a matte blush right now that's
what I need in my life hope there's some
matte ones in here also found this on
glambot freaking scored look in box this
is the Tarte works of tart holiday last
holiday collection whoa this is huge
okay even still has the sealant thing I
think this has every single tart blush
that I have ever wanted to own in my
entire life literally get ten blush
shades in here so I'm going to take the
shade icon because it looks like a
really nice mauve kind of muted shade
I might actually mix that with concept
yeah I'm going to do that here's concept
right here nice more natural like muted
blush shade might bring a little bit up
to my temples okay eyeliner so this is
the Loreal noir looks like it has a nice
fine point who goes on nice and matte
we're going in for the wing not bad okay
that was actually super easy got a nice
fine point so I would totally use that
eyeliner again I'm gonna spray my face
I'm using the elf makeup mist and set I
don't think this does a whole lot I feel
like it makes your face look a little
bit less powdery but I don't think it
does a whole lot as far as the setting
spray I'm just trying to use this up the
spray bottle is also pretty shitty
sprays you like a freaking fire hose so
you kind of just have to like move with
it these are super intense but I kind of
want to go with them these are the
violent boss doesn't say what number
this is oh I do not care
these have a super thick band before I
pop those on I'm going to put on a
little bit of this feline mascara I love
the packaging of this feeling the
leopard and gold whoa super tiny
bristles they're like the rubbery kind
of really tiny bristles I'm not going to
put on a ton just because I just want my
lashes to be black I don't really care
volumes we're putting false lashes on
just doesn't seem very lengthening so
I'm gonna pop on those false lashes and
I will be right back
okay so falsies are on I put a little
bit of bottom mascara on my bottom
lashes I really like these lashes how
they look they just the bands are pretty
thick so you can definitely like feel
them last step we're onto lips so I have
a few different lip options I got this
off of glam bought this is the Mac lip
density in burnt violet these lip
densities are new format might be too
intense right now I kind of want to do
more like a nudey but I'm going to
swatch this so you can see ooh this is
like super pretty deep plum that might
actually work love the smell of MAC
lipsticks then I how's this jcat lip
finiti these are their new liquid
lipsticks this is in the shade tonight
my name is I've tried these just like
swatched on my lip really quick and they
feel super super liquidy and like a
little bit drying it smells kind like
minty chemicals then I have the Smashbox
always-on liquid lipsticks because I
haven't full-on worn throughout the day
so I'm kind of curious to see how they
wear this is in the shade in demand I
think I want to go with this one I think
with the green eyeshade like this will
look best whoa this lip tensity is like
on there okay this is like super peach
pink I might need to blend this is like
super Brown so I'm just going to put a
dab not quite the shade I'm going for
I'm going to wipe this off and try
something else
I want more of like a nude nude okay
let's try the NYX lip londre in satin
ribbon this one usually doesn't fail me
then I'm just going to top it off with
colour-pop ultra gloss in the shade
fairy floss alright so this is the final
look I hope you guys like this video if
