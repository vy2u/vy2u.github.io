like chill log ish recap of gin beauty I
realized I never actually talked about
that in a video because I had things
pre-recorded for so long so I thought we
would just sit and chat so Jen beauty
was weekend of the 30th and I wasn't
planning on going and then I ended up
having to go for a work conference to LA
anyways which worked out really well
because I ended up getting to go to the
event and the cocktail party visibly a
weekend of like conference hopping and
networking and social link socializing
socially it was like a week packed into
three days basically probably getting
something right now I don't even
remember the days now but basically
everyone I talk about a link down below
but Christy and I went to the event
together we went to the cocktail party I
spell Batali like Lourdes Jen beauty
basically host a cocktail party kind of
thing at their MC studios for like
youtubers and bloggers and its people
who have a social presence so that was
the night before at the age n beauty
event alright so it is friday night I
Mindy Patel room
getting ready for the gin Judy a
cocktail party thing I totally Jim
things through
bringing like the bankers I didn't bring
a shadow so i'm using my husband palette
to
and I also have my fusions we're gonna
 my break so it might do something
like that especially didn't you picture
my outfit or anything
little black dress so that's how it
looks okay so Christi night we were
there together christy is awesome we had
a really good time it was funny she was
like you're exactly the same in your
videos you just smile a lot more in real
life and that's totally true I like
can't smile in my videos because it just
isn't natural like I'm not I'm not
laughing at anything I'm not making
myself laugh when I'm sitting in a room
talking myself to camera and smiling
doesn't feel natural to me I don't do it
anyways the party was cool got to meet a
lot of people went to like I'm asked a
couple years ago but I feel like that
was the first time I was a in a
situation where you could actually talk
to other youtubers so that was really
cool and I got to me Holly Holly
lipstick
for those Studios right now
her skin is unreal looks like the doll
or something who else doing me I met
mani mani mua well so I'll bend you
there and I almost peed in my pants i'm
just drinking alright so i just got back
from the party it was freaking amazing I
just pulled like meeting everyone in
person there was a good amount of people
there it was just really fun it was full
getting a chance to actually talk to
people there's just a good time it was
fun we got insane swag bag without a
goodie bag which is literally like the
size of my body I'm pretty sure there
might be bricks in here they seriously
hooked it up I'm going to be having a
huge giveaway when I hit a hundred
thousand which is insane to me I
like I can't even comprehend that the
saving products for the last few months
for you guys I'm gonna have a huge
giveaway and some of the products that
were in the swag bag are going to be in
that give way so you guys will get a
chance to have some of the products yeah
it was just cool experience getting to
talk to people who are like-minded and
who just do the same thing a lot of
people in like real life don't really
understand blogging or YouTube or that
whole world because it is like some
little world
and I totally get that but it's just
nice and you could talk people with
those kind of things you actually get in
you're in it with you super glad I went
to the gen beauty cocktail party thing
as far as the actual event I didn't stay
very long because i just got done at my
other conference and I was like wiped
out at that point I was just like needed
to eat so I ended up leaving and I went
to my friends house who lives in LA it
was fun seeing her I spent the night
there and then I left back to Seattle
the next morning so I had a quick trip
to LA but it was super fun I'm glad I
got to me everyone that I did now i'm
really excited for vlogger fair and i'll
definitely be going to imax next year

guess that i am going to be at
vloggerfair this year which is august

guys are gonna be there so I can meet
you guys I feel like that's all I had to
say in this video I hope you guys

that I had it was hard to blog so I was
kind of just in the moment the whole
time but I try to remember to whip out
the camera also if you want to see the
