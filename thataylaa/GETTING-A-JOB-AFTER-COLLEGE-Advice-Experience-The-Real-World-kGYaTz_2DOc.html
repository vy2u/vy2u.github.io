window right now because I literally
just filmed this entire video and the
mic wasn't on so there's no sound
it was literally half our video we're
gonna try and rerecord this as best as I
can
the mic Owen alright so today we're
going to be talking about tips for
getting a job after college this is
something that I feel super passionate
about because it was one of the most
stressful most discouraging times and I
think it is for a lot of people and I
think there's not a lot of guidance
there
I just realized a couple weeks ago that
it's that time of the year again when
college graduates are looking for jobs
I'm just gonna give you guys some tips
and some stuff that worked for me I did
a similar video like a girl bows grad
video last year I rewatched that video
and there was actually some useful
information on how to get a good resume
and how to write a cover letter and kind
of the basic things that you should do
when applying for jobs so I'm going to
link that over here so you can watch
that video first and then come back here
to watch this when you are a senior in
college this time of the year is
probably the most stressful three to six
months of your entire college career it
was for me it was definitely one of the
most discouraging most stressful times
it is freaking hard finding a job after
college and it's something that there is
not a lot of guidance for at least at my
university it might be different for you
guys but there is not a whole lot of
guidance pretty much everything that I
learned I learned
I did a ton of research it's really
scary when you don't know where you're
gonna be three months from now or if
you're even going to be employed I think
there's a lot of societal pressure on
students to get a job straight after
college has you just spent four years of
your life studying something and spent a
 ton of money on this education and
now you have to go do something with it
so just to give you guys a little bit of
background on this topic
I majored in international relations
learn to Arabic looked in the Middle
East thought I wanted to do something in
the Middle East which I still do then
the whole YouTube thing kind of shifted
everything I realized I was super
interested in marketing so coming back
from Jordan senior year I decided I was
gonna do a business minor take marketing
courses and just try and get as much
relevant coursework and what I wanted to
do as I could in that last year of
college so if that happens to you where
you totally change your career path
while you're in college either senior
year or before which I think a lot of
people do and it's kind of shitty
because it's something that you spend
three years of your life studying and
then to kind of realize the fourth year
that you want to do something totally
different it's hard I would say they
either take coursework or do some kind
of freelance work or something senior
year of college that's relevant to the
job that you want to get after college a
lot of people in the other video are
kind of confused because they thought
math was my job I was working at Mac as
makeup artist senior year of college but
that's not really what I wanted to do as
a career I loved it it was amazing but I
just had different career goals for
myself but that was kind of like an in
college job and after college like I
said I wanted to get something in
marketing and I was really interested in
startups long story short I did end up
getting a paid internship after college
I got an internship
at a startup which I was super excited
about it was a PR internship like I said
I was an international relations major I
didn't specifically have an interest in
PR but I loved the company and I wanted
to see if there's other opportunities to
kind of transition and grow throughout
the company that internship was
literally the best most valuable three
months I've had I just had such an
awesome team I learned so much I grew so
much not to sound cliche but I just
learned about the real world and I
learned how companies actually work
unless you have some kind of connection
it is pretty rare that you're gonna get
a job straight after college you'll
likely get an internship which i think
is a great step especially if it's paid
I would say like 80% of the internships
I was looking at were unpaid which is a
whole other issue which really bothers
me anyways so that internship ended up
turning into a full-time position on the
marketing team doing something that I am
super passionate about and I'm super
excited about yeah I worked there full
time now so the advice I'm giving guys
is not just from what I went through but
also being on the other end of things
now that I'm at a company I've
interviewed people and I've seen the
kind of things that they look for so I
thought that information could be
somewhat helpful for you guys to know if
you're looking for a job so I'm gonna
skip over my tips for resumes and cover
letters because like I said those were
all covered in the other video something
that I think could be super useful when
you're looking for drawers is to go out
of your way to do something that shows
that you're taking steps to getting to
where you want to be for example if you
want a job in social media when you
graduate you can go around to your
neighborhood go around to shops in your
town and offer to do free social media
consulting or run their Twitter or
whatever something that shows that you
have a goal in mind and you're taking
steps to get there for after college any
kind of work that you do especially
senior year college or junior year of
college is going to look really great on
your resume
it's gonna make you stand out because
companies get hundreds and hundreds of
resumes so anything that you can do that
sets you apart is fantastic so you have
a kick-ass resume cover letter because
you watch that other video now you're
starting to actually apply for positions
online LinkedIn is obviously one of the
most popular sites to use the system
that I found that worked best for me was
instead of looking at like in deed or
LinkedIn where there's already hundreds
of applicants I would look up the cities
and type of jobs and companies that I
was interested in and then head over to
their site and look at their career page
a lot of times companies won't post a
job listing on LinkedIn or whatever
until a couple weeks after they post it
on their site because they want to open
it up for referrals and stuff so if you
can get in there before the other 400
people on LinkedIn you obviously already
have an advantage that's easier to do if
you know what kind of position you're
looking for if you know what kind of
company you're looking for I would say
my biggest table applying for positions
or looking for positions that interest
you is to keep an open mind and be super
broad with your ones you're gonna see
that when you start the job search
process you're gonna have a specific
company that you want to work for you're
gonna have a specific position and then
all of a sudden you start to realize
that good frickin luck getting that one
position you're gonna have to be a lot
more open-minded and where you start out
and what you do at the beginning
probably isn't gonna be your ideal
career but everything that you do is
working in the right steps towards what
you want to do in the end I also found
that a lot of the times even if there
was a position that you weren't
particularly super interested in and I'm
talking about internships right now even
if it wasn't the exact internship that
you wanted if you got to the point where
you get a call with the recruiter or the
person interviewing you I would just
talk to them and tell them what you're
really interested in a lot of the time
something else will open up that they
just haven't post
or whatever I also got to a point where
I was applying for ad agencies and even
if they didn't have a listing for an
internship I would just call them up or
email them and ask if they wanted help
anything that you can do to give
yourself experience it's going to be
super helpful and like I said is a step
in the right direction also speaking of
connections networking is really
important and it's something that I
totally did not understand when I was in
college I think this totally depends on
the university I feel like some
universities really set you up for
success when you graduate personally I
feel that mine was zero help in the
graduation process just going out of
your way to go to professor's office
hours or to talk to the guest speaker
after you go to a lecture those are the
kind of things that you never know when
that connection is going to be useful
again and I kind of learned how
important networking is since being at
the comfy I'm at right now so many new
hires get the job because they knew
someone to referral don't be afraid to
reach out to professor's or family
friends or your parents friends or
whatever if there's some kind of
connection that can be useful for you my
next tip is be persistent if getting a
job was easy after college everyone
would get one and no one would live at
home it's not easy it's super difficult
it takes a lot of persistence and it
gets really discouraging my suggestion
is to either set a day or time each week
where you're gonna sit down and you're
just gonna crank out 20 applications you
might have just heard 20 applications
and thought that was a walk or thought
that was super little I probably sent
out over 100 job applications when I was
applying I talked in depth about how to
tailor your resumes and stuff in the
other video to each company staying
determined and thinking about the big
picture is what's really important
another tip which might be tubulin for
some of you but things don't just happen
they happen to some people and that's
great but if you're like me good things
don't just happen to me I have to work
really hard to make them happen you're
not going to get a job here I'm going to
get interviews you're not going to move
to a different city unless you make it
happen you're in charge of that it's up
to you and you should be trying
everything that you can to make that
happen if it's something that you want
if you want to go home and you want to
look with your parents or whatever and
that's also totally fine people have
different goals but if your goal is to
do something new and start your career
can get a job then you're gonna have to
work your ass off to do it
so you've submitted your resume you've
submitted your cover letter all of that
good stuff and you get go back for an
interview I personally feel that I am
NOT a good at interviews it's something
that I am working on if you also don't
think you're gonna interview is I would
just practice with someone or practice
in a mirror do your research both
obviously on the company that you're
applying for but also typical questions
asked in interviews and best practices
for interviews having now been on the
other end of it actually interview
people I think that at least definitely
for startups culture fit is one of the
biggest things which I didn't realize
someone could be a genius but is there
not going to be a company culture fit
and they're not gonna get along with the
team well it's going to be a no make
sure that you're applying to a specific
company for the right reasons you need
to show that you're actually passionate
about the kind of work that the company
is doing and the kind of things that
they strive for and what you would be
doing to help them grow so just do your
own research as much as you can to make
sure that you do actually want to work
for that company you definitely
definitely want to follow up after the
interview if you look online there's a
lot of differing opinions on when you
should actually follow up and how long
you should wait and all that good stuff
personally I think you should follow up
that night but I think it just shows
that you're really interested in the
position and you had a good talk my last
tip throughout this whole process is try
not to get discouraged and try to stay
positive I know that's something that's
super difficult to do especially
when you get rejected one after another
it is really up to you whether or not
you do anything in your life really if
you don't think that you have the skills
to get the job in what you want to do
then go do things and learn things to
get those skills I know this is a super
hard time but you've worked for four
years now for this moment this is the
final straw so don't give up I believe
in you guys and I think you can do it if
you are a senior in college and you're
applying for jobs right now but you
should be because it's that time of the
year I hope that this was somewhat
helpful for you if you have any
questions about this whole process I
