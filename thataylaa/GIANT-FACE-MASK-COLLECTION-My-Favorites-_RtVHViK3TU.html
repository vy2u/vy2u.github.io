all right so today we're going to be
talking all about one of my favorite
things in life face masks oh good so I
have two chibi IKEA racks this size that
are about to break filled with face
masks so we're going to be here a while
grab your drink get comfy we are doing
this if you follow me on snapchat you
know that I do face masks almost every
single night it's just what I do to
relax and wind down at the end of the
night I love a good face mask so this is
my full collection of face masks so I
don't use all these on a regular basis
I'm going to go from my most used face
mask my most loved ones down to the ones
that I'm not so excited about or the
ones I haven't tried yet just so you can
get an idea of the ones that I really do
like I'm going to try and power through
this so this is in a 30 minute long
video about face masks so the first one
I've talked about before this is the
Aztec secret Indian healing clay face
mask you can get this off of Amazon you
can mix it with water or I like to mix
it with apple cider vinegar because
that's really great for acne this isn't
like a chill relaxing kind of face mask
this thing freakin works and you feel it
working on your skin when I take this
off my skin is super red but in the
morning I swear it helps my acne around
ten bucks on Amazon because this is more
of a treatment I typically only use this
once every week or a couple weeks I'm
pretty lazy when it comes to actually
mixing the powder to that it is a
straight powder in here so you have to
be you know motivated to do some mixing
to wear this one so lately this has been
one of my most reached formats I talked
about this in my pamper products video I
talked a lot about my favorite face
masks in that video so I'm not going to
talk a whole lot about this but this is
the origins out of trouble 10-minute
mask to rescue problem skin loves it
sort of my acne I love to Mentholatum
kind of scent in it feels really nice
and cooling I use this one a couple
nights a week or just as a spot
treatment on some of my open acne
another origins one I loved and I've
used for years now is origins clear
improvement active charcoal mask this
one is almost empty this actually
reminds me a lot of the L'Oreal pure
clay mask another favorite this one is
heavily scented the L'Oreal one but I
actually like the scent of it smells
like perfume but I think that could be
kind of overpowering for some people but
I am literally scrape and bottom on this
one this one I really feel like helps my
skin and this is one of those mats that
I actually noticed a difference after
when I wash it off I feel like it's very
detoxifying kind of pulls everything to
the surface origins is kind of
we're having pretty great ingredients so
if you want to splurge go with this one
if you want a drugstore option go with
the l'oreal one another charcoal mask
which is also one of my favorites is the
Giovanni purifying facial mask this has
activated charcoal volcanic ash super
antioxidant acai and goji berry and you
can get this one off of iHerb this is
around I think this is under 8 bucks
definitely under 10 bucks to charcoal
but it almost has a gel kind of formula
to it it's much more spin and creamy but
it drives down a light gray color it
smells really nice and fresh it's not
too overpowering but it definitely has a
fresh kind of scent to it I'm pretty
sure you can actually find some Giovanni
products at TJ Maxx and Marshalls now
but super coupon I herb by the way if
you're new here I have combination skin
I get oily throughout the day on my
t-zone so I typically like masks that
are more detoxifying and kind of not
drying but detoxing I guess rather than
moisturizing mask did you have a few
moisturizing masks but I usually
typically only use those if I feel like
my skin has some dry patches or weird
texture or something going on the body
shop face mask
I love I've used this one for years if
you've been watching my channel for a
while you've probably heard me mention
this ten thousand times this is the tea
tree mask I love the color of this one
it's a super appealing like spearmint
green kind of color look at that it's
tea tree so it does have a very cooling
tea tree kind of scent to it I also feel
like this one helps my acne this I've
gone through three of these guys they
are smaller but this is the derma e
purifying two-in-one charcoal mask I
like this one because this has a bit of
an exfoliation to it it has kind of the
gritty feeling so when you wash off the
face mask you actually get an
exfoliation it does it decongest pores
of excess sebum dirt and toxins so this
one should be good if you have more oily
skins but I actually really like the
size of this because it's perfect for
traveling I can stick this in my travel
bag so this is one of those masks that I
like the process of putting it on and
how it feels I don't know if it does a
whole lot for my skin but it just feels
really refreshing I love the color of it
and I feel like the color is a big thing
for me because I don't know there's just
something really satisfying about a
really nice shade of face mask this is
the freemen mint and lemon clay mask and
it does smell pretty lemony yeah it has
a really fresh lemon minty scent go
figures but the color of this is like
tiffany blue it is a claim
ask it drives down okay this one
probably should have been mentioned a
little bit higher because I do use this
one a ton it was just under another face
mat so I couldn't see it but this is a
fresh umbria and clay purifying face
mask this I love it is very expensive
but for me it's worth it when I run out
of this I will be repurchasing it it
doesn't have a pleasant scent it doesn't
have a pleasant color kind of looks like
baby vomit yeah there's the color smells
a little bit like Mario Badescu like
just doesn't have the most pleasant
scent but I do feel like this is one of
those that kind of brings everything to
the surface okay this is your only
sizzle leave it on for three to five
minutes whoops I leave this thing on for
like hours literally I think I leave all
of my face mask on for a couple hours
just because I like to put it on watch a
TV show edit do whatever I'm doing that
night and then I rinse it off a couple
hours later so these two next ones are
kind of the last ones that I really
frequently use and love the rest is more
of my collection so this is the Dermott
9 cents a jar me this is the German
inés own math system t-zone this is
actually that mask you probably seen on
Instagram where you do like the
different zones of your face is like
multi-masking so in some areas like on
your cheeks I think it's the
moisturizing one and then this one
you're supposed to be putting on your
t-zone
I actually like the t-zone one the best
and I like to put it all over my face
it's that detoxifying kind of charcoal
thing which I obviously have a thing for
if you have more dry skin you might like
this because you can actually moisturize
other areas of your face typically in my
travel makeup bag I put these two masks
the derma 9 and then this pure active
one this is the skin purifying mask of
sulfur acne treatment I probably only
recommend this if you have asked me but
I do like it I actually use Proactiv a
couple times and I have had success with
it it's helped my acne but then it comes
back a few months later so this one I
was super excited about because it looks
really appealing but this was kind of a
letdown to me this is the bozo charcoal
pore pudding side of this and how its
swirled and everything about this was
really satisfying to me when you get it
it's like a perfect world I just don't
really like this one I don't feel like
it does that much to my skin I don't
particularly like the smell of it it
smells like Mario Badescu for the price
I've definitely passed on this one this
is the Oprah acne treatment mask this is
just a white mask I haven't used this
one a whole live think of use this two
or three times it smells good it has
that vintage kind of scent to it I kind
of
I use the skin I'm gonna use this
tonight actually since I've only used a
few times can't for sure say it's done a
whole lot for my acne course tale
extract what the heck is that
speaking of Mario Badescu this thing
smells like ass this is the drying mask
I literally don't even want to open this
lucky for me this is actually a backup
this one is sealed
I must have tossed the other one because
this one does really dry out if you
don't use it quick enough it'll turn
into like a rock solid kind of thing
can't smell it through the seal thank
God here a couple of the other L'Oreal
masks when they came out with that black
one they launched with three masks i
just realised on the actual container of
these they don't have a different name
they all just saved pure clay masks so i
guess you just know by the color online
i don't know this one is supposed to be
more moisturizing i believe why was that
so hard to come out and I was like
fluoride like from the dentists this one
I think is supposed to be red clay I've
used this one a couple of times I don't
like it as much as the black one but I'm
remembering correctly this one has kind
of like the exfoliating beads in it
they're just super tiny this is the Tula
exfoliating treatment mask with
probiotic technology this is another one
that's a really pretty tiffany blue kind
of color I've used this one a lot and I
like it I don't love it
Tula products smell like bathroom spray
to me so I just can't get over that it's
kind of a moisturizing exfoliator if
that makes sense so if you have more dry
skin but you need an exfoliation you
might like this so this one I just
discovered I've never tried this I
forgot that I had this this is the
belief first aid transforming peel-off
mask
I like the belief aqua balm moisturizer
so I want to try this and there was no
sealant on it maybe I have tried this I
think I actually might have tried this
just can't remember what I thought is
this at all
great moment what do you believe so
since I won was peel off let's just have
a moment to talk about my thoughts on
peel-off mask and sheet masks you
probably noticed by now that I much
prefer wash off face masks peel off mask
for me I don't feel like they do a whole
lot it's easier to take off at night
because you don't have to wash your face
if you're really tired or something you
just peel them off peel off mask are
much more convenient I wish I liked them
sheet masks I cannot stand I have a
bunch of them I try to get into them
it's kind of like oatmeal I really want
to like them but every time I try it I
can't get into it I think it's because
when I have my mass on I like to do
stuff like around the house
and if I have a sheet mask on I feel
like I can't move slide all over your
face I just can't get down with it
but speaking of peel-off mask this is
the Boscia bright white mask I got this
I think off of Poshmark for like four
bucks or something so I haven't actually
used this much of it but it's just like
a white peel-off mask this is supposed
to help even skin tone and minimize the
appearance of dark spots so could be
good for acne scarring stuff all sheet
masks that I never used it will promptly
sit in there for two years we all knew
this moment was coming these are all
glam glow so glam glow sends their
entire face mask collection and their PR
packages I would have never spent this
much money on face maps I recently did a
comparison of the enlight silver mask
versus this glam glow one so if you want
to do that video I'll put it in a little
eye over here but after doing that I
started looking at the ingredients in
here and I don't know I haven't gone
through the ingredients on all of my
face masks I should probably do that at
some point but after looking at the
ingredients in this one natured alcohol
is the third ingredient in here and that
is not super great for your skin the
fact that this is so expensive and
they're still putting in kind of crap
ingredients is a little bit questionable
to me but really out of all the glam
glow masks the only one that I feel like
has made some kind of difference and
that I liked is the glam glow super mud
clearing treatment this white one again
this has alcohol really high up on the
list so long-term probably not the best
for your skin
this in light one I do like go back to
the video if you want to learn more a
couple more powder masks that you have
to mix like loose powder that you mix
with water or something is the now
solutions Moroccan red clay powder I
haven't tried this one yet I got this
off of my herb and then this is the
true-self detoxifying mask you've
probably seen a ton of post on Instagram
about this I've tried this a couple
times and I haven't given it enough of
the go these masks I've had in here for
forever and I've been meaning to do a
video on this for forever this is the
carbonated bubble play mask that you've
probably seen on Facebook or Instagram
this thing blew up and then else came
out with their own hydrating bubble mask
so I kind of wanna do a half face bubble
test let me know down below if you guys
would want to do that this I think I got
off of yes style I'm pretty sure this is
a Korean product
skin food to wash off rice mask this
one's like a gel kind of pearly white
mask I wasn't super into this I think
the idea what the rice is that it's
supposed to soak up some of the oil this
one totally broke me out I don't know
I still have this this is the yes -
coconut ultra hydrating facial mask
anything with facial oil in it usually
breaks me out whether it's coconut oil
argan oil anything with oil on my face
typically breaks me out and I think I've
only used about one time the packaging
is is drew me and this is a formula ten
point 0.6 I don't know if that's the
brand this one's to get your glow on
skin brightening peel mask papaya and
citrus I liked this one it wasn't
life-changing or anything for me off the
first go pretty sure I found this out
Alta but I think this brand is also at
CVS now this is the body shop drops of
youth bouncy sleeping mask and typically
kind of hesitant a sleeping mask just
because I don't want it to clog my pores
or anything this one smells kind of like
a toned-down
Jolly Rancher really nice packaging
super heavy glass I think I've used that
one one time or maybe twice as far as
moisturizing mask this one so far has
been my favorite this is the road Isle
stem cell superfood cleanser this is a
two in one cleanser mask so you actually
can just use this as a facial cleanser
but I love this on for only about ten
minutes and it is a super super thick
Elma feels like when you dig into
coconut oil the first time how thick it
is and then it warms up with your
fingers I'm also kind of smells like
fluoride but this I actually notice
difference even in ten minutes I use
this when I was having some dry patches
on my forehead and I just put it all
over let it sit there for 10 minutes and
the cool thing with this is that since
it's a cleanser you can just rub it off
and it doesn't leave a super gross kind
of residue on your skin but your skin
looks and feels super moisturized
another body shop one I got a few
packets instead of getting the actual
mask but this is the Himalayan charcoal
purifying glow mask and I like this one
I just hate taking this off it's kind of
like the black glam glow mask where has
the pieces of charcoal in it but these
it's fricking stick to your face either
have to go in with one of your facial
brushes or a washcloth or something to
totally get them off of your face this
one I just got when I got the
Enlightenment get one free so this is
the super face clay time purifying deep
cleansing treatment mask I've used this
once or twice I like the packaging of
this this one smells really good to me
if you don't like licorice you probably
would hate this then it has a little bit
of a licorice scent to it it actually
contains an aaj which is promise
so a couple times I've used this I have
liked this one I need to keep using this
alright we are on to the last two this
is the fresh rose facemask I got this as
one of the things 100-point perk or
something from Sephora haven't tried
this at all yet this was at the bottom
of my thing so I think I totally forgot
about this yeah Ceylon just whoa this is
interesting smells like tea oh I do not
like to send to this this is like a gel
mask and there's little pieces in here
I'm guessing rose yeah those with real
rose petals whoa
then last I have this hmmm face mask I
don't know if you can find these in the
US but if you can try these out because
I've actually tried about five of these
I got these in Norway at the H&amp;amp;M there I
actually did a whole makeup haul for my
trip so if you missed that I was awhile
ago that was back in May if you missed
that I'll put it in the eye over here
but I hauled a bunch of stuff that you
can't find in the US and these face
masks are one of my favorite things that
I picked up they had a ton of different
ones they had a whole wall of like
colored little pod things which was
really appealing both the racks are now
empty that is my entire face mask
collection I don't know if any of you
are still with me right now but if you
are if you stuck around until this point
comment the word rose petals down below
so I hope you guys like this video if
you did make sure you give it a thumbs
up so I know love you guys thanks for
watching see you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
