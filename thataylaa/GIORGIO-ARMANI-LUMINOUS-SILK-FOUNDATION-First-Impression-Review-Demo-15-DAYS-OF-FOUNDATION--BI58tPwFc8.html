never gonna buy my life
all right so today it is day nine a
fifteen days of foundation this is why I
try out a new foundation every single
day for fifteen days days one through
eight our link down below in the
playlist you can go back and watch all
of them starting from day one we're a
little over halfway through the series
we're shooting to raise $20,000 by the
29th for project B to share I can't give
you guys a like up-to-date running total
in this video since it's pre-recorded
but make sure you're following me on
Twitter Instagram everything because I'm
gonna be updating you guys where we're
at but today we're trying out a
foundation I have no idea why I haven't
tried this until this day but this is
the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation does anyone else have issues
saying Giorgio Armani this is probably
one of the most talked about foundations
of all time this is like one of those
foundations that I remember years ago
like when I first started my youtube
channel I remember hearing about this
foundation and being like alright that's
the foundation I'm never gonna buy my
life and here we are today so it's
pretty cool on Sephora they carry the
full-size but they have the mini size
now which is pretty sweet I wish more
foundations did this because then you
don't have to worry about expirations
you can try out a foundation for a
little bit cheaper so in the full-size
of this foundation it retails for $64
and you get one fluid ounce of product
you can get the mini size for $42 and
you get zero point six ounces of
products not the most economical
decision but if you just want to get a
feel for a foundation and you don't want
to commit to the full size then it could
be a good option so this foundation
comes in 24 shades I actually have the
shade 3.75 because their shade system is
a little bit interesting I picked this
one because the description says fair
skin with rosy undertone if you look at
3.5 it says light to medium with warm
undertone so just make sure you're
reading the description and also Google
swatches and stuff that's usually what I
do with foundation if I'm trying to pick
a shade is I'll Google the shade number
and everything so I'm Sephora says this
for all skin types medium coverage
lightweight liquid foundation that
achieves a radiant silky finish this
award-winning foundation is formulated
with micro fill technology producing a
low density product that pairs high
impact pigments with weightless texture
so essentially it's supposed to be
lightweight and weightless but it still
has coverage so I'm gonna search
swatches right here so you can see what
the shade 3.75 looks like compared to
some
foundation's all right we've got some
swatches right here is the Giorgio
Armani luminous silk foundation in the
shade 3.75 next over is the cover
effects power play in P 20 CYO life
proof in 101 NARS ultra radiant
foundation in Mont Blanc Maybelline fit
me matte and poreless in 110 derma
called 2:08 so if you're excited for
this video and you've been enjoying 15
days of foundation don't forget to give
this a thumbs up I appreciate it
if you're new here you can join the BAE
Rito family and subscribe I'm uploading
every single day from now until the 29th
alright the hype is real with this one
because I feel like I've heard so much
about it over the years that I just have
very high expectations right now but I'm
gonna try and bring it down a few
notches
I think 3.75 is gonna be a good shade
match I like that in the menu packaging
they still give you a glass bottle and a
pump I'm gonna give this a shake I've
already washed moisturize in prime my
face what time is it right now right now
it's 9:20 well looks pretty liquidy
here's it on the back of the palate yeah
definitely liquidy so let's start out
with a sponge on this side of my face
looks very skin-like so far with the
sponge is looking like light coverage on
the side I think we got a pretty good
shade match here do a brush on the other
side I'm curious if I can get more
coverage with the brush because it's
looking like light coverage on the
sponge side I can see everything coming
through it feels like it dries down
pretty fast like you don't have a ton of
time to work with this so you probably
would want to work in sections with this
one that I can definitely see my texture
more on this side I got a little bit
better coverage with the brush but I
like the finish with the sponge so I
think this is one that I would apply
with a brush and then smooth it out with
the sponge I do want to build this up
because I feel like I'm getting pretty
light coverage here it's supposed to be
a medium coverage and I don't feel like
I'm quite at medium coverage on my
forehead I'm not taking any more product
I'm just gonna smooth it out quite
natural coverage it's not really
covering any of my scarring I've been
trying to kind of build this up and
cover my neck scarring and it doesn't
cover so this is something that if you
have any kind of blemishes scarring
pigmentation on your face you probably
would have to use a concealer over top
or underneath I wasn't expecting it to
be a full coverage but it is a little
bit lighter coverage than I was
picturing well what's this hair doing I
would say this is buildable to medium
coverage off of just one layer and I
used a decent amount of product I would
say it's more in the light coverage
range but I'm gonna look up close and
see how this is looking a little
underwhelmed a little underwhelmed it's
not looking bad I just don't think it
particularly looks great I like how it
looks on my forehead actually but around
my nose area and just down here I can
just kind of see it sitting on top of my
face it looks like I'm wearing makeup if
I'm gonna be wearing something that is
more on the light coverage side I want
it to look like skin I don't want it to
look like I'm wearing makeup I look a
bit makeup B this might just be one that
takes a little bit to warm up to my skin
it is tacky so I do think I need to
powder this part of my face a little bit
but it doesn't feel like it's gonna
slide around it is transferring a little
bit so I do think I'm still gonna set
just this area of my face I can blend
stuff on top of it right now it's a 932
so I'm gonna do the rest of my makeup
and I'll be right back okay so it's now
10:20 we're calling to check in time
9:40 right now I am kind of glad I
didn't buy the full size so I looked out
in natural lighting and I'll show you
guys a clip like always in natural
lighting but I definitely liked it
better out there so that's a good sign I
almost liked it it almost looks good on
my skin is just not quite there so I
think this might be one that would look
really good with something like mac fix+
or some kind of setting spray just to
kind of melt it into my skin so I will
try that with the setting spray and
everything for the wrap up video I
always try out the foundations of
different ways mix them use different
primers setting sprays everything and
then I rank them in the wrap-up video
which is going to be going up on April
9th I feel like I can make this one look
a lot better if it wasn't just on its
own and the wrap of video on April 9th
is also where we're going to be
announcing the winning shelter that's
going to win 5
thousand dollars and also where I'm
gonna be doing a meet up so don't forget
to cast your vote one time a day of
check out the link we're also trying to
raise $20,000 for project BT share so
mugs are on their t-shirts are on their
so we'll see how this one wears
throughout the day but that's kind of
how I'm feeling about it right now I'm
going to start a clip and natural
lighting so you guys can see what it
looks like and then we'll do a little
flash test we are in natural lighting
right now so let's take a look I like
the shade I'm already starting to crease
a bit right here this side not as bad I
wouldn't say this is a super satiny
finish I mean it looks pretty matte in
certain areas but you'll see stuff
coming through so let's do a blood test
it always looks like there's a lot of
flash back to me when I'm looking at it
in here and it's just cuz my eyes are
like not quite here from the flash and
then when I edit it back it does not
quite as bad as I think it looks in the
moment but looking at it right now it
does look like a flashback for sure to
me I mean it's quite a bit lighter than
my neck in the photo I also noticed as I
was doing my makeup when I went to close
the twist top this actually doesn't lock
shut which is a little bit annoying
because if you're using this to travel
like the mini sized you would have to
put this cap back on and like not lose
this it does just slide on but I feel
like I'm gonna lose this in two seconds
it's super nice out today in Seattle
it's like 65 and sunny so I didn't want
to do like full-blown makeup cuz I want
to go outside and go and walk and like
enjoy this day so I just did really
basic makeup really enjoying where did I
put it this thing this little Smashbox
Smashbox trio eyeshadow thing this is in
nudie pic they sent a ton of these
things and I had all them in my donate
giveaway pile and then I randomly picked
up this one because I'm always looking
for these exact tones basically it's
reminds me of a Physicians Formula when
I always used to use years ago we'll
have a good everyday cool tone kind of
trio quad situation and this one has the
perfect light shade for my lids if you
have greenish eyes they just kind of
make them pop so this is what I've been
reaching for on like an everyday basis
just when I want to do something quick
so that's all the shadows on my eyes
right now I had all of them in the
giveaway pile and as soon as I tried
this one there's like five that are now
back in my makeups - so I was pleasantly
surprised by these I feel like I haven't
been a big fan of Smashbox shadows in
the past but these little trio things
are actually pretty nice just smudge
some black pencil liner for my eyeliner
today then on my waterline I put on this
nude kind of thing from Gigi Hadid
Maybelline sprite and on my lash line I
put on my normal mascaras which will be
down below for bronzer I tried out this
Tarte don't be afraid to dazzle and so
far I like this shade I tried the
highlighter but it was a little bit too
dark and emphasized my texture so then I
switched to elf Hart and I just put this
one over top and I also have this on my
inner corner of my eyes then I use my
ciate summer love blush and let's say
use this Sephora liquid lipstick in the
shade 33 I always use the other one what
is it 22 or something and this shade is
great why do I not use this more and
that's everything so check-in time is
nigh 9:40 I'll see you guys in a few
hours in natural lighting all right it's
now 249 so it's been on for over five
hours I'm feeling not the best right now
so I'm gonna make this a quick check-in
kind of the same situation it looks
pretty matte and a little bit dry on the
bottom half of my face and then this the
top of the top of my forehead my
forehead looks a bit dewier I would say
actually it's like you can see every
little ounce of anything on my skin
right now not the most smoothing seems
to be starting to crease a bit around my
mouth area this was already starting at
the last one but it's gotten a little
bit worse but that is where we were at
right now I will see you guys at the end
of the night okay so it's actually
pretty late right now it's ten thirty
seven what time did I even start this
check-in 9:30 I think it's been on for
over 12 hours like 13 hours I just got
home so we're gonna do this final
check-in I've been looking at it
throughout the day I like that it
doesn't look necessarily any worse like
it it pretty much stayed exactly the
same all day so that's good I just don't
love it definitely not something that
would pay $64 for at this point maybe
I'll find a combo that I really like
with it I just feel like I have
foundations and products that look a lot
more flattering on my skin right now do
you still have the crease right here and
some creasing around here but it doesn't
look bad I'm not getting
her lip creasing center of my forehead
looks a little bit of something that's
going on there looks like it's rubbed
off or something a little bit right on
the center so at this point right now I
can't say that I'm liking this one but I
also don't dislike it's kind of like
right in the middle but let me know down
below what you guys think of this
foundation I know this one has been out
for a long time so it's probably a lot
of you guys who have tried this one if
you have certain combos that you like
mixing this with or setting sprays or
something that you like with it let me
know what those are down below if you
enjoyed this video don't forget to give
this a thumbs up I love you guys thanks
