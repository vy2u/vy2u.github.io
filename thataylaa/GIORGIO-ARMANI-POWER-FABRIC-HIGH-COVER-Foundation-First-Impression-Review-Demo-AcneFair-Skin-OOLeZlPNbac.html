alright so today it is foundation Friday
and we're going to be talking about a
brand new foundation I feel like I've
been hearing a shit-ton about this
foundation lately this is the Giorgio
Armani power fabric long wire high cover
foundation super quick before we get
into the video I am very excited to
finally share the dates with you guys
for the next 15 days of foundation if
you're new here 15 days of foundation is
a series on my channel that I do every
few months where I test out a new
foundation every single day for 15 days
it's a lot of fun I've been working with
project video share again this time
around to come up with something really
cool for you guys for I think at school
hope you guys think it's cool foundation
Friday videos B 15 days of foundation
playlist are always linked down below in
the description box so if you want to go
through and watch the other series you
can do that so the dates for the next 15
days of foundation are April 5th to the
19th okay that means literally right
outside my window I'm going to be having
a video coming out on Friday March 31st
which is going to be in place of a
foundation Friday video but the
announcement video talking about the
series and what's different this time
around and what we've been working on so
that's really where you guys will hear
all the details about the next series
but get stoked because 15 days coming
back so I have been working very hard to
still have three videos a week going up
for you guys leading up to April 5th I'm
already starting to pre film for 15 days
of foundation I've been taking your
foundation recommendations on snapchat
and Twitter so I still have a few days
worth of foundations that are to be
determined so if you have any
recommendations that you want to see
leave them down below
slightly stress but I'm soaked because
15 is the foundation is something that I
just love it's such a cool way to
interact with you guys and the fact that
I can work with projects maybe share
again is just really great and I'm
excited now into foundation Friday so
this product retails for $64 and you get
one fluid ounce of product $64 is an odd
price point to me like can you just make
it 65 sup other anyone else I've only
tried one of their Giorgio Armani
foundation before I have a video on it
it was the designer list foundation
let's say some of the claims on Sephora
so this a
full-coverage liquid foundation that
perfects with the Velvet Matte
lightweight second skin finish I am all
about that so leverage life so you guys
know I've combination skin with cystic
acne this foundation melts into the skin
blurring imperfections has SPF 25 in it
blah blah blah ultra lightweight formula
to achieve flawless results for up to 16
hours so that's pretty good if it
actually lasts that long I typically try
and do 10 hour wear test so I'm gonna be
keeping this on pretty late tonight it
says because every woman is unique this
foundation features in array of 20
shades to suit all skin tones the
deepest shade is 14.5 it says very deep
with red undertones the lightest shade
which I have is one that says very fair
skin with rosy undertone I was debating
between the shade 1 &amp;amp; 2 2 says fair skin
with golden undertone
I feel like golden tone foundations
lately have been working really well for
me as I remember that the lighter shade
of their designer list foundation was
pretty dark for me so that's why I went
to shade one so I'm going to serve some
swatches right now so you can see how
the shade one compares to some of the
other lighter shades of foundation that
I own all right so swatch time right
here is the Giorgio Armani power fabric
in the lightest shade next over is Kat
Von D lock-it tattoo foundation in L 42
I just ran over to the office to get
this let's watch it and as you can see
sometimes a is a tiny bit more pink
toned this is the Marc Jacobs remarkable
foundation in the lightest shade here's
derma called 2:08 which is a really nice
shade match for me and pur cosmetics
paradol foundation in the shade
porcelain you guys will see in the demo
how the shade one worked out for me
but based on this I have faced that
there is probably a shade to match your
skin tone so I do appreciate that this
has a very expensive shade range does it
for all skin types on Sephora I've been
hearing pretty positive things about
this in the YouTube land but actually on
Sephora there are some really not so
great reviews so I'm curious to see how
this works throughout the day so that's
all the claims if you like foundation
Friday videos make sure you give this
video a thumbs up and if you're excited
for 15 years of foundation hell yeah if
you want to see my thoughts on the
Giorgio Armani power fabric foundation
and how to apply somewhere throughout
the day you're in the right place just
keep watching I did not breathe it all
well it's just that I've already washed
and moisturize my face since I'm out of
my UA anti blemish matte primer which I
usually use in
single foundation video for the past
like six months pretty much I'm trying
to find my new go-to face primer I have
five thousand face primers so I'm trying
to hold off on buying the GA one again
and so far as I'm liking the elf blemish
control face primer it has kind of a gel
feel to it but it still gives a little
bit of tackiness which is what I like
because I feel like it just kind of
adheres your foundation to your face a
little bit better so that's what I use
to prime my face today standard
foundation bottle for Giorgio Armani so
this is supposed to be full coverage
there's a pump and it's a glass bottle
so I'm going to pump out some on the
back of my palette aka
that's and Body Works candle lid oh this
shade actually looks pretty light a
designer lift foundation that shade was
way off for me the lightest shade so on
one side of my face amuse the brush like
normal and on the other side I'm going
to use a Beauty Blender so this guy was
sitting in a bowl of baby powder since I
filmed the jam soo under water does game
video if you missed that I will put it
cuz I'm over here I'm really into self
brush for foundation lately I'll link
the exact one down below it's not
technically a foundation brush but it
works awesome for foundation plan it on
the forehead I'm actually filming two
weeks worth of videos in a few days so
even though you guys are seeing all
these spread out over a couple weeks
it hasn't been here for two weeks all
right let's see definitely too late for
me so if you're paler than I am then
this is great because this post
this is like we're not just talking
light this is very fair I'm gonna have
to definitely use the powder on my face
today to darken this up so I can go
outside because I guess I should have
gone into the store for this one I'm
gonna have to use the darkest powder I
have to make this even to my skin tone
just bronze the out of my face
today but let's see how it covers this
acne spot up here
foundations lately have been clinging to
some dry patches on my forehead so I
don't know if I have more than normal or
if it's just this major oh my god I
can't take myself seriously right now it
might just be this major acne right here
but it's not looking great on my
forehead I mean it didn't totally cover
all my redness and stuff amazing you
guys in a second some reason I feel like
this is going to apply better with
Beauty blenders so steal this foundation
well props to Giorgio Armani for coming
out with a really light shade and I
swatch this yet but by the looks of this
to me this is looking like Kat Von D l42
kind of shade
I definitely like how this applies
better with a sponge on one layer I
would say I'm getting high coverage but
it's not totally full coverage on my
skin I can still see acne freckles and
stuff coming through so you can still
see my skin coming through especially
like over here there's even some redness
coming through I am going to build it up
a tiny bit and see if we can cover that
so I'm going to go in and offer a full
second layer just on the areas where I
feel like I need a bit more coverage and
see if it's buildable at all for some
reason it's getting kind of patchy so
the finish of it looks really nice it
looks like more of a satin matte finish
at least right now might dry down to a
totally matte finish and adding a bit
more seems to be covering pretty well
but for some reason on both sides it's
not covering up my redness on my cheeks
which is kind of weird so let's try the
forehead if you have dry skin you might
need to do some playing around with this
to see how it works for you because the
dry patches on my forehead it's not
looking great on but the center of my
forehead and over here where I have less
dry patches is looking totally fine I
actually really like how it looks on the
center of my forehead right now so we're
out full coverage now it is weird how it
looks a little bit patchy on my cheek
areas so I'm charging but I just looked
at it and in times 12:05 right now so
I'm going to apply the rest of my makeup
and try and warm this up to match the
rest of my face and I'll be right back
all right so it's now 12 48 I'm going to
call the check-in time 12:15 because
that's pretty much when I finished up
powdering my face and everything and I
feel like I'm looking much more alive
feeling alive feeling good so definitely
adding the cosmetic celebration
foundation illumination powder which is
one of my favorite powders of CET
foundation wise in the shade fair this
totally helped to make it more my skin
tone I feel like it's a hundred percent
wearable now I also warmed up my face a
little bit using the brand new benefit
hoola light bronzer which I actually
have a whole video on my time you guys
are seeing this this is the video that
I'm filming today same day so if you
want to see how it applies and also
shade comparisons and a couple drugstore
dupes then I'm going to link that video
over here that went up earlier this week
but anyways I'm gonna tell you what's on
the rest of my face in a second but
let's just talk about the foundation
real quick so I want to try and start
doing more flash test if the
Commendation does have SPF in it so
let's go ahead and do that
SPF 25 keep in mind I have a powder on
top right now so that can influence it
it look really intense in this photo but
focus to me it looks like it has a
little bit bounce back my face in real
life definitely matches my skin tone
right now in this picture is looking a
bit lighter so maybe a tiny bit of
flashback so I actually feel like even
with the powder and this powder does add
a bit of coverage keep in mind even with
the powder I don't feel like it looks
totally completely full coverage which I
don't mind I like the way my skin is
looking right now with the powder on but
if you're someone who has a lot of acne
or redness and things to cover up
definitely have more full coverage
foundations Marc Jacobs remarkable derma
Coll those are definitely much more full
coverage than this one if you don't have
a lot of problem areas to cover up it
will definitely look more full coverage
on you and you'll probably need way less
product as well that's kind of standard
with most foundations but when I look up
close it actually is sitting really
nicely on my pores we're not using any
kind of pore filling primer my poor area
looks really good right now like much
smaller than typically does and the
center of my face looks nice with this
powder it did help to kind of make my
forehead look a bit more smooth and less
clingy on the dry patches
I had to conceal my acne spots down here
a bit more since the foundation didn't
totally cover it up before I put on the
powder I would say satin matte finish
since this is an illuminating powder my
face is looking a bit more glowy right
now so on the rest of my face what I use
the hoola bronzer like I said the all
may blush in nude mauve is a makeup
revolution vivid baked I lighter in the
shade radiant light this was like major
throw back to me the revealed smoky
palette who remembers this thing I think
I actually have a really old video on
this I revealed 2 palette used to be one
of my favourite eyeshadow palettes and I
actually was going through makeup in the
office and bringing over a bunch of
stuff so I tried to stop again and I
liked it
lashes these are my new favorite lashes
appear lashes the band is really nice
and thin and probably talked about it 50
times by now but this is the jetsetter
kind of that I'm wearing right now tart
tart iasts lip paint and namaste with
maybelline bear at all 9/10 and actually
have a video on all my favorite
drugstore nudes lipsticks t-shirt
necklace watch jewelry everything is
linked down below always so I'm going to
go
out my day probably peel off these
lashes after I filled in the second
video and the next chicken I do will be
in natural lighting so see you guys in
two hours
okay so it's now 5:30 so it's been on
for a little over five hours and I'm a
natural lighting right now I'm on the
iPhone actually just ordered the canon
g7x - these check into natural lighting
so it'll be better quality but the
reason why I don't bring my good camera
out here anymore is because the settings
I have so dialed in now in my room that
I would have to change them every single
time I go back and forth so the Canon
will be coming I tried so hard to hold
out until this check and peel off my
lashes but it wasn't in the cards okay
so let's talk about the foundation have
my mirror here for some reason it's
showing up more GUI on camera I feel
like and it does in real life my skin
looks pretty satin I mean it looks glowy
but it doesn't look really on my
forehead and I feel like on camera it's
looking a bit oily for some reason it
looks smooth I think my favorite thing
at this point is how it looks around my
poor area it's rare to find a foundation
that kind of toned down my pores it's
looking way worse on camera for some
reason in real life right now I'm liking
it it's not creasing on my upper lip it
doesn't look super textured anywhere
I think the powder helped a lot with
that because it cosmetics powder
typically like smooths and kind of adds
life back into your skin so that could
be helping but no major complaints at
this point I'm going to continue working
and I will check back in with you guys
at the end of the night okay so it's now
9:27 I feel like I look really scary
right now without these false lashes on
in this intense lower line so the
Foundation's been on for nine and a half
hours now and I've got to say I feel
like it's holding up pretty well and I
was looking in the bathroom mirror and
our hallway mirror it looked pretty nice
and smooth considering I think a lot of
the finish and how it looks right now
has to do with the powder I wasn't
totally in love with this before I put
on the powder and I'm still not totally
in love with it you have a lot of stuff
to cover up like I do on my skin this
wasn't as full coverage as I had hoped
for for 65 64 64 bucks it would have to
be like very worth it to me I don't know
I'm going to try this one out a few
different ways and see but I definitely
would need to get a darker shade for
sure unless I'm using a really dark
powder again but that being said since
this one is very
and I like how it lives on my pores and
it has been pretty long-lasting I might
be a good one to mix with other
foundations but by itself I'm not
totally in love I don't know I want it
to be but I'm not I feel like this might
be one that I just have to work with a
little bit more and see what I like I
don't think it's horrible at all keep in
mind that it did cling to some dry
patches and I feel like it could have
looked a bit more flawless off of the
first applications but the finish of it
and how it's worn throughout the day
looks pretty good I think I'm not
getting any creasing on my upper lip and
around my nose area and center of the
forehead and everything for me this
looks pretty good after almost 10 hours
so I just wanted to update you guys it's
actually the next day and I tried
wearing this foundation again in a
different way
and I liked it a lot better with the
products that I mixed it in with so I
mix it in with the Leo le BB cream which
is one of my favorite BB creams but it's
really dark on my skintone so I do have
to mix it with something and I just
mixed in about one to one at the Leo le
to the Giorgio Armani and then I set it
with the Maybelline matte maker powder
and right now at 6 o'clock and I put my
makeup on at 9 o'clock this morning so
it's been on for 9 hours right now this
is under the bathroom light so this is
like pretty accurate lighting how it
looks in real life and I think it looks
pretty good for being on for nine hours
I mean it's not breaking down at all on
the center of my face
so mixed in I do think it held up really
well throughout the day and I like how
it looks mixed in I don't know if it's
worth $65 to me to use as like a mixing
foundation but maybe if I do mix it with
other products and it helps keep it on
all day and it looks good then I guess
it could be worth it but I just wanted
to let you guys know so here's a little
update my thoughts I'm going to go watch
shameless fun relax so I hope you guys
like this video if you did make sure you
give it a thumbs up
love you guys thanks for watching see my
next video bye e alright so today what
am i doing we're not family manager
