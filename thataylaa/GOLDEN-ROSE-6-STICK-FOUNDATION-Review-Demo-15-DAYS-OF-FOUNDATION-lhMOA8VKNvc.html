now because I have no idea at this point
I think it's day 8 we're going to go
with that alright so today is day 8 of
15 days foundation if you're new here
this is where we are trying out a new
foundation every single day for 15 days
so today is that foundation is a
drugstore price foundation this is
actually the cheapest price one we've
done so far this is the golden rose
stick foundation this retails for $6.99
on Amazon with Free Shipping
gotta love Amazon I have the shade zero
one it comes in seven shades on Amazon
but on golden roses website you can get
it in eight shades I think it has one
darker shade there are virtually no
claims online I think it literally says
three things on here basically says it
creates a natural appearance good
coverage smooth velvety skin high
coverage perfect adhesion it's pretty
much all it says so I was randomly
scrolling on Amazon to find foundations
I've never heard of which it's a
frequent hobby of mine and I came across
this one and it got really good reviews
I've never heard anyone talk about this
product at all I've never heard of the
brand golden rose but based on what I
was reading online it looks like it has
pretty good coverage and it got really
good reviews so I'm excited to try this
oh says it's made in Turkey I just maybe
like ten times more excited about this
product so like in every one of these
videos you can check the description box
for 15 years fundation playlist that has
days 1 through 7 in it so you can go
watch all those if you miss them you can
also leave your foundation
recommendations down below in the
description box
pretty much all foundations I picked so
far have been from recommendations from
you guys so I do read them and take them
into consideration I can't believe 15
days foundation is officially half over
how do you guys feel about that I did
want to say because a lot of people have
been asking about this I am going to be
rating them 1 to 15 in the final video
so you guys can kind of see my overall
thoughts about how I feel about each
foundation so I'm going to be doing that
in day 15 if you guys are excited about
this series
my 15 years of foundation make sure you
give this video a thumbs up share with
your friends do your thing
I've been sharing a ton of you guys's
photos that you've been snapping me with
the hash tag 15 days of foundation on
Facebook Twitter everywhere so if you're
not following me there you should i'ma
stop talking if you want to see how
foundation applies and where's
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching all right we
are doing this so it is 9:30 in the
morning right now I'm in San Diego right
now I'm actually on my aunt's house
because there's major construction going
on at my parents house so we had to
change locations but it's all good for
here you guys are literally stacked on
like ten books right now I don't have a
standing there so I'm gonna attempt to
do this with the shower mirror classy so
my skin has been doing pretty well
lately the past couple days you wouldn't
read too much into it this is look at
what happens it'll be like horrible for
a couple weeks and then start clearing
up again so I'm going through a good
patch right now this is good for me
I do have combination skin with cystic
acne and I also just got my brows done
which we'll talk about more as I'm
putting on the foundation so I have to
kind of be careful to avoid the brows
today classic stick packaging black and
gold and then it twists up I've only
swatch this and actually looks pretty
light and we're in natural lighting
right now so I obviously didn't pack my
ring light so let's just apply this I'm
just going to bloom this I don't have a
primer on my face but I did moisturize
my face I actually didn't even bring a
primer I totally forgot so I'm not going
to be able to test half in half I'm
going to use a brush on this in my face
and then try the Real Techniques sponge
on this side of my face my favorite elf
brush I love using this for cream
foundations so we're going to go in and
blend this is where it's like when I was
magnifying here so I have to literally
have it like on my face in order to not
be blurry ooh
so far this actually reminds me very
very similar to the mega forever stick
foundation so FAR's blending out really
nicely so my kind of coverage
without foundation in the shade actually
looks light looks good I need to majorly
avoid the brows right now I just went to
the second session of my permanent brows
it did a whole video on the process my
first time and this time I was basically
adding more shape I'm in love she did
amazing I want to carry a fine line
Studios in Pacific Beach I'm going to
link her information down below but you
guys should check out that first video
as well you don't have concealer brush
but I have this little kind of eyeshadow
brush so I'm going to try and actually
put some on here so I can get around my
brow oh yeah so blend it out really
quickly and easily with the brush looks
like a satin matte finish I don't think
this looks completely matte pepperidge
wise I feel like we got it about a high
medium coverage I'm going to go over a
couple spots afterwards just to get full
coverage and see if it builds let's do
it on the other side I'm going to take
the Real Techniques sponge now and
blonde boy this is a damp sponge people
always ask if it's damp yes you always
dampen your makeup sponges I do it
before or filming's I have to do it on
camera oh okay this is unexpected
it's actually blending out really easily
and nicely with this bag interesting
okay that literally took about ten
seconds tops to blend out and the finish
looks really nice with the sponge I
think I actually got better coverage on
the side as well I might have just
applied a tiny bit more product but I
definitely liked the side with the
sponge better which kind of surprised me
and the brows are going to lighten up I
explained all about the process getting
permanent eyebrows in the other video
but basically they you have to do a
darker than you actually want because
they fade in a week or two and I like
dark brows even with like when I have
silver hair I like the look of darker
brows with lighter I think it looks more
like edgy no I'm saying what am i doing
okay so I love the way that this side of
my face looks I'm at a tiny
on this side and blend it out with the
sponge yeah blends out beautifully with
the sponge
and definitely getting full coverage now
who only pleasantly surprised with this
$6.99 on Amazon hell yeah
don't you feel like we really need that
much more coverage on the forehead but
why not no complaints so far it's
sitting really nicely on the face
especially for not using a primer at all
I just feel like it looks super nice
soft kind of finish not clinging to any
dry patches or anything a little bit
actually I'm a forehead right here but
nothing horrible everywhere else it
looks super smooth and I'm liking it so
far so I'm going to apply the rest of my
makeup and I will be right back all
right so it is now 952 in the morning
the foundation looks great everything
blended out easily on top of it I did
set just the side of my face with the
cover cracks illuminating setting powder
just so I could blend out bronzer and
stuff and it doesn't like drag and then
I set my face with the make it forever
mist and fix and it looks really nice
looks good on the forehead looks good on
everywhere I'm liking it so I'm going to
show you guys the close-up so you can
see the finish of it and everything okay
literally like squatting right now just
feel like it looks super smooth really
like the finish of it and let me show
you guys the brows it's always darker
and like fuller looking right when you
first get it done so when it fades
you'll be able to just see the stroke
lines but I vlogged basically the whole
second part of it on snapchat you're not
on me on snapchat it's the tail of snaps
you should come on let's throw onto my
booster my wings are definitely not even
right now but Yolo I have this a lot
more brown in this lighting right now
okay 950 so we're going to check back
throughout the day and see how it's
wearing by the way on my lips right now
is the tardis lip paint in the shade
namaste this was like one of the little
Sephora bonus thing
and I really like this color like it has
the perfect amount of pinky tones in it
doesn't feel like it's going to be super
long-lasting and it definitely transfers
we were just having a chill family day
we're going to me and mine are going to
go get our nails done get lunch and then
I will check back at work okay the
Lighting's like way better with them
actually closed right now I feel like so
it is now 3:13 what time did we put this
on Foundations been on for five hours I
think I hope I'm five hours yeah so far
I'm really liking it I've gotten
compliments on motika it looks really
nice and smooth in here it doesn't look
too bad in a car mirror which I feel
like makeup never looks loitering in the
car mirror I don't know what the heck
kind of lighting goes on really hard but
I feel like you always look 50 times
sugar you're in the car that needs you
in real life the car it did look a
little bit almost separated on my
forehead and on my chin a little bit in
here it looks okay on my forehead I tend
does look a little bit dry a little bit
separated that's the best way I can
describe it my cheeks look totally fine
which you click really good but I like
the overall finish and the way it looks
on my face it looks really nice and
smooth it looks a little bit cakey
around eye nose area right here and the
forehead does look a little bit textured
damn my brows look good I almost think
with the smoothing primer underneath we
could be golden cheeks though look good
overall I feel like when you're just
looking at it like this it looks really
nice I like the shade I think the shade
is actually like a almost perfect match
for me it's not too light it's not too
dark still liking it I think with the
different primer and maybe a setting
powder it could be perfect because I did
set this area of my face now I'm
thinking about it so maybe if I set the
forehead would look as flawless as the
cheek area so I'm going to go get some
editing done we've been out all day and
then we're going to be
a dinner thing tonight so I'll probably
check in after the dinner since I'm
going to have all this on still for the
rises now the end of the night it's 9:40
p.m.
this is like the jinkies that have ever
right now you guys are definitely
crooked but it's gonna have to do you're
on a candle flip upside down on top of
the bed this is literally the only
semi-decent lighting I could find in
this room so the Foundation's been on
for 12 hours now pretty much which is a
long-ass time
it is pretty much totally broken down
around my nose area my forehead actually
looks decent I thought my forehead was
going to be a lot worse but my forehead
and my cheeks look totally fine it's
pretty much just around my nose area
that's broken down I overall really like
this for $6.99 I think it's an awesome
stick foundation I was super surprised
the way that I blend it out I would
definitely wear this again I love the
shade of it I think the shade is super
flattering my mom said it looked good
which is rare has mama beggary toe
approval next time I wear it I am going
to try it with a setting powder just on
my forehead and around my nose area to
see if we can avoid some of the
separation but overall I definitely
think it's worth a shot for $6.99 if you
have pale skin this is light enough it
is on the lighter side for me but it
works so yeah I'm pleasantly surprised
for under seven bucks
it gets worth trying out if you guys
liked this video and you are excited for
day 9 at 15 days foundation tomorrow
give it thumbs up love you guys thanks
