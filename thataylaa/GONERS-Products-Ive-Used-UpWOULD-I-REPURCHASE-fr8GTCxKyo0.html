all right so today we have an empties
video me showing you the products I've
used up my trash whatever you want to
call it I really like seeing these
videos because it gives me an idea of
the products that people are always
constantly reaching for or the ones you
might not like and you just want to get
rid of so I feel like it's just a good
way to do kind of many reviews on things
that I've completely used up whether I
like them or didn't like them I don't do
these videos a whole lot because it
takes me a long time to go through
products I think just because I'm trying
so many new things all the time that it
takes a really freakin long time for me
to go through a whole thing so some of
these things I've been working on for a
long time so I have them all in a very
heavy bag here that I'm not gonna lift
up to try and get in frame let's get
into it if you're excited for this video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up the
look I'm wearing right now I actually
filmed a 15 days of foundation video
this morning so you guys will see this
foundation and this look coming in 15
days of foundation which starts this
week on Thursday the 15th 6 p.m. Pacific
time is day 1 don't forget to get your
t-shirts down below we're trying to
raise $20,000 from project B t-shirt so
link is down below 100% of the proceeds
goes to them oh actually I just tell it
to you guys in this video you guys won't
be hearing it until like day 6 of 15
days of foundation but we actually added
two mug designs to the page to the
teespring page and they are actually
throwback 15 days of foundation designs
that were a limited edition so those
came back and they're now on mugs that
was actually recommendation from you
guys so thank you to everyone who
recommended that great idea so if you're
someone who didn't get your hands on the
previous designs if you're a newer
burrito here or if you just want
something that says 15 days of
foundation on it we have the mugs in
heck yeah it's 15 days of foundation and
then also the don't talk to me it's 15
days foundation so those are also linked
down below in the description box but
those are brand new what the heck I keep
trying to cover up this lash glue I try
to do this like 10 times alright so my
first product I've used up is the soap &amp;amp;
Glory flake away
I think it's just called flake away shea
butter sugar and peach spa body polish
so this is basically one of those body
polishes that has like the little beads
in it smells so good this just reminds
me of like summer this is awesome to use
if you have dead skin I love the scent
of soap &amp;amp; Glory there's something about
their scent that's so unique if you've
never smelled it they're in Walgreens
now I believe so just go and sniff it
amazing this I would definitely
repurchase once I'm off a keychain I
haven't been using any kind of body
scrubs because of my eczema right now so
I have two hair masks I've finally used
up the first one is the e salon deeply
invested nourishing hair mask this one I
usually love Eastland hair products this
one I wasn't I didn't not like I just
wasn't impressed by it like I probably
wouldn't repurchase this one I just feel
like it didn't do a whole lot there heat
resistant spray is one of my favorite
products the smoothing lotion smoothing
product it's in like a purple bottle
squeeze bottle that's one of my favorite
products this one I probably wouldn't
repurchase again like I said I just
didn't notice that big of a difference
this one though I really like this this
is the Chi tea tree oil revitalizing
mask I just love the scent of t-shirt
oil anything tea tree sign me up
this one I feel like that was literally
in the middle of a sentence okay
flying out here this mask I would
repurchase again but I also feel like I
have a drugstore one that I like a
little bit better if I was with someone
at Cosmoprof and they could pick this up
for me for like half price I probably
would but I think I would just go with
the Loreal mask over it which I'll
mention next up I used up a whole thing
of my a cosmetic celebration foundation
illumination powder there's like a
couple little pebbles in here I've
talked about this so many times on here
but this is in the shade fair I love
this powder this is one of my favorite
powder is this is a powder foundation
but it's one of my favorite powders to
set my foundation because it adds some
coverage it gives you the most beautiful
glow I do find that I can still use this
on my dry skin I liked it on my oily
skin it's not an oil controlling powder
by any means I just love the way my skin
looks when I wear this if you want
something that has good coverage and
that's a glowy powder look no further I
wish they came out with more shades of
this because the shade fair is a little
bit too dark and I don't think it
cosmetics ever goes very deep so that
would be great but awesome powder if
you're into glowy powders and you
haven't tried that I don't even know
when I use this thing up I can't
remember the last time I use this this
is the skin to Navia makeup finishing
spray oil control I remember when I
first started YouTube and Scandinavia
was the only setting spray out on the
market and everyone was talking about it
now it's like I never hear Scandinavia I
think just because there are so many
other setting sprays now and I
definitely have a ton other setting
sprays that I like more than this
setting spray I might do my favorite
settings
raise video because I do have I have a
lot of favorite settings phrase setting
sprays for me aren't just something that
makes my makeup last longer because to
be honest I think there are very few
that actually make your makeup last
longer for me a more you setting sprays
to settle everything in together there's
just something so transformative about
putting on a setting spray it can just
melt the foundation in the powder
together it can just make your skin look
so much more healthy and natural looking
and not super cakey and Foundation II so
that's why I use setting sprays this one
I don't remember thinking there was a
huge difference I don't think it really
helped to control my oil obviously
finish this up before accutane there's
no way how to use an oil controlling
product on my dry skin right now this on
the other hand is one of my all-time
favorite holy grail setting sprays when
I said there are very few that actually
make your makeup last longer I feel like
this is one that does that this is the
makeup forever mist and fixed I wish
they did something with the scent of
this it smells so disgusting to me it
smells like feet it smells so bad but it
works this gives your skin such a pretty
glow and it actually makes my makeup
last longer which is why I keep
continuing to repurchase this I think
this is probably my no sixth or seventh
bottle this definitely would recommend
if you're someone who is either just
starting out with setting sprays or
you've never found a setting spray that
actually did something try that one
two empties of things that I use over
and over again that you guys have seen
50,000 times my Physicians Formula eye
booster in the shade ultra black if
you're trying this out make sure you get
the shade ultra black I love this eye
liner I will always repurchase this this
is my most used eyeliner for sure it
just glides on it's so easy to get a
wing I don't find that ever dries out
the only thing is it does get this
little fray thing sometimes but I use
mine to death like this last me a long
time I just love the way the brush feels
this very smooth feeling it just glides
on it's black it lasts all day I love it
Wet n Wild mega length mascara this is
totally worn off you can't even see what
it says but here's a new one this is
what I'm currently using I've used this
for years now this is my favorite lower
lash line mascara because it has these
really tiny bristles super super tiny so
it's just easy to get your lower lash
line without getting mascara all over
your face this one can also be really
helpful if you have really tiny lashes
right on the center like by your inner
corner that you want to get you can get
with this kind of wand and this doesn't
transfer down to my concealer it is so
hard to find a mascara that doesn't
transfer down and this one doesn't
which is why I've just stuck with it for
years it's great it's everything I look
for in a lower lash line mascara if
you're using the same mascara for your
top and bottom try switching it up try
switching to something like this this is
a couple bucks from the drugstore so you
might still try it out and if you have
issues with your concealer transferring
down there make sure your under eyes are
set so make sure this is powdered really
well if you have long lashes on the
lower lash line don't look down while
your mascaras drying because that'll
also cause it to transfer but this
should not transfer so this is a face
wash I was using before I started
accutane this is the elbe acne do't face
and body scrub this has 2% salicylic
acid in it before I would only use
things as else--if acid benzoyl peroxide
does not do good things for my skin this
I really liked I think I mentioned this
in a raisin rejects video I mentioned
this in multiple videos at some point I
felt like this actually helped my skin a
little bit if you have acne and you're
not ready to like go on a medication for
it or something maybe just have a few
breakouts here and there try this out I
really love this I have three different
Neutrogena noses Garnier makeup removing
pads I tried the Garnier micellar makeup
remover pads these Garnier ones work
like they took off my makeup I just
don't like that this is not alcohol-free
I don't think it doesn't say
alcohol-free on here I also tried the
pink one out not bad I just definitely
wouldn't buy those I still love my
Neutrogena makeup remover wipes I still
use these if I'm not using my oil makeup
remover if I'm just feeling lazy I'll go
and with these I will forever continue
to repurchase these I love these here's
another one these are the fragrance free
ones I find the fragrance free ones to
actually burn my eyes a little bit which
is weird and the pad seemed to be a
little bit not as soft I used up an
entire survey skin renewing night cream
if you've seen my dry skin skin care
routine while on accutane video goes
very in-depth about every single thing
I'm using on my skin right now and that
I have been using for the past five
months this product is like Holy Grail
status for me I love this night cream
I'm gonna continue to use this even off
accutane because I just love the way it
makes my skin look and feel it feels so
soft this is one of those products that
I just can tell my skin reacts really
well to this is
completely used up I've already gotten a
new jar obviously have to have this
every single night we have a Too Faced
better than sex mascara used up this is
my favorite mascara I love layering this
with the Catrice glam a doll mascara or
just wearing on its own it just gives my
lashes so much volume makes them so
black people either love or hate this
mascara which I feel like happens with
most mascaras people just have such
differing opinions on mascaras I used up
a whole Misha magic M cushion foundation
this is one of my favorite cushion
foundations I have a whole video on this
I've the lightest shade 21 which is a
little bit dark but I think it can work
they actually had this on sale for I
think it was 11 or 13 bucks on yes style
the other day so I already have a backup
this is a brand new one has great
coverage looks flawless on the skin and
I find that it lasts really well yes
style by the way is a great place to get
any kind of Korean Asian beauty products
because they always do these crazy like
60% off shield things or you can get
amazing deals so that's where I get
pretty much all that kind of stuff I
have one shampoo here and one
conditioner when I went through
sees with my hair like when I tried to
go gray and my hair totally got fried
off and destroyed we all know that saga
it was to the point where my hair was
spaghetti literally like the gummy
sticky spaghetti it was totally not
manageable ended up just having to chop
it all off and even then for a few
months I was dealing with like this much
of totally destroyed damaged hair this
was one of the products that I feel like
really helped me I used this shampoo
conditioner and I also used their I
think it was like a leave-in deep
conditioner I'll leave it down below
this line I feel like actually helped
repair my hair along with this line this
is the L'Oreal total repair extreme when
I was going through this whole thing a
lot of you guys recommend this line and
the hair masque I was talking about
earlier by L'Oreal is also this line of
the hair mask so these products if you
have super damaged hair out try them out
I tried Redken stuff I tried tons of
high-end stuff I tried different
drugstore stuff in these two lines I
think did the most and I would
repurchase this and I would repurchase
this something that I would not
repurchase I actually think they gave
this to us on the health trip but this
is the hydrogel under-eye mass with
purified water see feed extract and
licorice I just feel like this did a
whole lot of nothing I love my gold
under-eye mass that I get off of Amazon
I get like a pack of 12 or 24 a super
reasonable price a link those down below
I love those I feel like those actually
deep puffs my eyes and do something
these ones I literally just didn't
notice a difference at all I kind of
just used these up to use them up I
don't know why I kept this because who
knows what was even in here
oh there's glitter I actually think this
might have been that Halloween gold
glitter pumpkin okay this is a Mac Paint
Pot in painterly this isn't totally
empty
but I mean you can see the bottom there
this just got to the point where I had
it for so long and it was so dried out
that it wasn't even worth trying to
salvage at this point I've done that a
few times already it's just time to say
goodbye to this guy Mac Paint Pots are
my favorite eyeshadow base hands down
right now I'm using the one in soft
ochre here's a painterly shade compared
to soft ochre other way soft ochre is
much lighter and more of a yellow tone
it definitely shows up on my skin it's
just like a yellow kind of tan shade but
if you're putting eyeshadow over top you
can't see it anyways I just find that my
eye shadow applies be best when I use
these it makes my eyeshadow stay on all
day it's just the best base in my
opinion this project I feel like I liked
when I first started using it and then I
don't know if my lips just got used to
it or what there's some major fuzzies on
here this is the Urban Decay rehab
makeup prep lip love but the more I
started using it I feel like my lips
almost got used to it or something and
it just stopped kind of working and
didn't do a whole lot we have another
setting spray this one is quite dirty
this is the Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray I feel like when you think
of setting spray this is just like the
one that pops into your head I still
like the settings right I use it it's
not my favorite it's just kind of like
if I have it laying around I'll use it
but I wouldn't buy this over some of my
other setting sprays this is a collagen
eye mask that I actually used this
morning this is by the brand etude house
I actually got this as a sample thing
with my yes style order they threw in a
couple different face masks which was
cool and this I mask this one I liked
much better than the elf one I noticed
when I took off my under eyes actually
felt and looked really moisturized so I
think I would try this one again I only
have this one little pack so I don't
have another one try but if I was
placing an order on yesterday I think I
would purchase this one the only thing
with this one is that I didn't feel like
it really stuck to my under eyes like I
kept having to push it up just because
it was so liquidy that the patches just
kept sliding down that's something I
love with the Amazon Gold ones is that
they just stick there you don't have to
worry about them and they feel kind of
like cooling this one had a little bit
of cooling I noticed towards the end
like right before I took it off but it
wasn't something where I put it
I was like whoa my eyes feel very cool
we have a soap and glory clean on me
this is just a body wash smells amazing
it's moisturizing again this isn't
something that I would use on my eczema
right now but before that I would use
this right now I'm just using a Nivea
one which I like but I think I'm gonna
switch to a dove one once I use that up
another elf charcoal hydrating mask kind
of the same situation didn't really find
them to do anything since being on a
kadai not to talk about acting five
thousand times but talking about skin
care here since being on it though I
haven't used any of my normal face masks
I used to be a face mask queen I love a
good face mask
I used to use detoxifying oil
controlling purifying ones like a lot of
clay masks and things now I stay away
from those I don't want anything drying
those dead I've been using sheet masks
which if you've seen my face mask
collection video I think I talk about
hide despise sheet masks and I still do
but there are two that I found that I
really enjoy that I can deal with that
stay on my face and that I feel like
actually do something this one is my
favorite this is the Misha pure source
sell sheet
shea butter mask you can find these on
Amazon or Ebay I actually ordered last
ones on eBay cuz I couldn't find them on
Amazon anymore but I think I got like a
12 pack for around 10 bucks so these are
very reasonably priced the thing I love
about the sheet masks is you put it on
and you can actually see your skin
absorbing the product like this sheet
actually starts to become drier it
doesn't slip around your face it just
kind of like absorbs in you don't have
gross coming out of the mask at the
bottom when I take this off my skin
visibly looks and feels more plump more
moisturized I can actually see this one
doing something I don't find that it
breaks me out if you have dry skin try
out the shea butter sheet mask it is
awesome I also really like this skin
food coconut one both these are
definitely Korean there's Korean writing
on them it's coconut one it contains
coconut oil which is controversial some
people say go for it it's amazing on
skin
some people say especially you have acne
don't but I've used this one a couple
times by the way I just kept one ovh up
and throwing them away I don't like the
coconut one quite as much as the Mesha
one it has a faint coconut scent and the
Mesha one just has a very pleasant
almost superlight vanilla scent this one
I would not repurchase again this is the
beauty scoop avocado and college
just my typical beef with sheep mass it
just falls off your face didn't feel
like it did anything I didn't notice any
kind of difference afterwards yeah I
just probably won't buy this all right
we're coming to the bottom here I feel
like I always have one of these in an
empties video this is a Claire all nice
and easy three CC whatever conditioner
this is the conditioner that comes with
the Clairol hair dye which I do use on
my roots I love the blue black one I
feel like it lasts really well in my
hair but this conditioner is bomb they
need to turn this into its own
conditioner because it is amazing it
makes your hair so soft so shiny
this usually lasts me a few times I
don't use this all in one go they made
this in a separate concealer conditioner
I would totally buy this this is a root
touch-up spray by age beautiful you can
get this at Sally's basic color black
obviously I've tried so many different
root touch-up sprays and this one is by
far my favorite the thing I like about
this is that it's not too messy it
doesn't get everywhere if you touch your
hair afterwards
you might get a tiny like hint of black
but for the most part it dries down I
don't have issues with it running in the
rain or anything which is nice I've
tried a few that were like a total
disaster think of L'Oreal one which
everyone comes in the blue bottle stay
away from that one in my opinion this is
better than the or Bay one don't spend
ridiculous amounts of money on a root
touch-up spray when there's this one by
the way basically root touch-up spray if
you're not familiar with it it's just an
aerosol can you just spray it on your
roots I could probably use a little bit
right now to cover up those Gray's
coming in if you color your hair it's
just an awesome way to get a quick root
touch-up it just washes out with shampoo
and this is definitely under ten bucks
so not bad we have a crest 3d white
toothpaste travel size nothing too
exciting there I either use crest 3d
white or Colgate optic white I love both
we have one hand soap now it takes me
forever to go through hand wash I don't
know why I obviously use it every time I
wash my hands it just takes me so long I
think now because I don't have a
roommate so it's just me like using up
all the things which is kind of nice cuz
I go through like toilet paper and stuff
so much slower I literally have to buy
like half the amount of stuff it's
pretty pretty sweet but this is the
method nourishing hand wash in the scent
coconut and this bottle is quite dirty
with like makeup on it every time after
I do swatches or wash off my sponge or
something I'll use this soap so I think
it just gets like the makeup on it I
love the scent of coconut I love
this hand wash I felt like it didn't
flare up my eczema or something so I
would continue to repurchase method hand
wash I really like the method brand for
cleaning supplies too we are down to the
bottom here and the rest is just candles
I don't have all of my candles here that
I used up because I kind of forgot I was
saving products for this video so I
think I tossed a few but this candle was
the Yankee Candle favorite pumpkin this
is making me miss fall t.j.maxx 1099 999
this one is a target candle Chesapeake
Bay vanilla pumpkin oh my gosh this one
smelled amazing burned forever and I
think this is the first time I've ever
had a candle burn like this it burned
too evenly the whole way down and
actually all the way to the bottom
I feel like usually I get something like
this I definitely want to try out more
candles from Chesapeake Bay this was
from Target camera if I said that I was
burning this into like past the holidays
this one is Cecil I just liked the
packaging of this and it smelled really
good too this was from TJ Maxx it was
$7.99 brands is DW home this took me
forever to freaking burn through feel
like it didn't really fill the room with
the scent at all I do love the packaging
though it has this really nice heavy
frosted glass packaging and I like the
little X's on it and then the very last
one is the celery cedar and citrus
Kindle my friend got me this for I don't
remember why according to the bottom she
got this at Nordstrom Rack it smells
really good it's funny when your friends
know your since like I totally know my
old roommates sense whenever I buy her a
candle I'm like I got this and she
totally knows mine because this is
exactly something I would go for I
really liked this candle I would buy
from this brand again alright so that is
it those were all the products I've used
up but hope you guys enjoyed this video
