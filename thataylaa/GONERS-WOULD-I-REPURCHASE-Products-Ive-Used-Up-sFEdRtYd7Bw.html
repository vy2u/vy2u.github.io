those days where my giving a level
is like underground hence why I have on
sweatpants ponytail I like half-made an
effort with my makeup until the
foundation was a total disaster tried
this thing again oily skin dry skin
doesn't matter what can skin I'm have in
the Anastacio foundation stick looks
like pure sees on me then I tried
to salvage it with this one didn't work
then we went in with the NARS when I
have like ten-pounders on my face right
now so this is trash what better
transition then to transition into
talking about actual trash so I fairly
recently did another empties video and
you guys seem to really like it so we're
here doing another one I'm kind of
surprised that this stuff has already
piled up this much but this is basically
where I just talked about things I've
completely used up what I thought of
them if I just wanted to get through
them because I didn't like him or if I
use them because I actually like them
and I'm in the midst of moving again so
instead of removing my trash with me
we're filming this video now but if
you're new here you can join the burrito
family and subscribe of whatever you
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. sip time
this week is actually a four videos a
week week a bonus video went up
yesterday you guys are saying what
someone's it yeah all right first item
I've totally used up is the two-faced
hangover three-in-one primer and setting
spray I've talked about this so much
love the setting spray this and the
makeup forever mission set are probably
my top two I love this for underneath my
makeup I could not live without this
right now having dry skin now this is
like a lifesaver if you have dry skin I
also will use it as a setting spray if I
want that glow which I usually do but
just depends on the foundation I'm
wearing sometimes I'll go to my makeup
forever one sometimes alone with this
one sometimes I'll go in with one of my
other 10,000 setting sprays but this is
completely gone I will continue to
repurchase this I already have this one
that I've been using next up I have a
Nivea moisturizing body wash here this
bottle is friggin gigantic it's like
half my body this one I liked it feels
very moisturizing it definitely very
creamy almost reminds me of like a milky
body wash I don't feel like it does a
whole lot with scent like your body
scent like it doesn't make you smell
super good it's just a very neutral this
might actually even be unscented which I
think might do I got it doesn't say
unscented on here but it has a really
neutral just kind of lotion II smell it
says care for dry skin I got this when I
was on accutane and this is what I
use throughout accutane i don't think
i'll be repurchasing this just because
body wash is one of those things i kind
of like to switch it up and just try
different things so this took me so
friggin long to go through I swear was
probably a year ago they sent I think 20
of these in PR literally 20 this size
and I donated the rest of them and I
kept one and it took me this long to go
through but this is the bioderma
sensibio h2o this is just like in my
cellar water it removes your makeup it
cleanses your face you can kind of use
it as both so this was kind of one of
those products that it did the job I
liked it I probably wouldn't purchase it
I just don't really find myself reaching
for my cell or water it's a whole lot I
would way rather use just an oil
cleanser to get everything off and then
wash my face and if I need to I'll go in
for my Neutrogena face wipes and just
get the rest of my makeup off or just
use that all over instead of an oil
cleanser so I just feel like my seller
waters
I don't usually reach for just because
it feels like an extra step for me and I
just would rather go in with like an oil
cleanser this is one of my favorite hair
masks that I finally used up we're kind
of mashing right now so the L'Oreal l5
total repair 5 damage erasing balm it
says am it
what almond and protein ceramides for
damaged hair people have their with
drugstore hair products but I find it
says before drugstore hair products with
the exception of a few high-end ones
that I have found typically work better
for my hair I don't know what it is my
hair feels softer it repairs my hair my
dead hair I just made a whole video
about my hair if you want a full on hair
update but my dead hair is pretty much
off from the whole going gray silver
kind of thing and this I've been using
since then and it's just totally helped
repair my hair this is all soft and
obviously fresh healthy new hair I mean
it's grown so that helps but I do feel
like this does something and this is one
of my go-to hair masks I'll continue to
repurchase this how I whitened my teeth
is I think one of my most asked
questions and I feel like I've mentioned
this so many times but have a whole
video it's called the pamper products
video that was filmed over a year ago I
want to say and I still use those exact
same products so if you want to know
exactly what I use to whiten my teeth
check out that video but one of my
favorite toothpaste is the Colgate optic
white expressway I also really like the
crest 3d white find that for some reason
switching between Crest and optic white
is usually the best for me but whenever
I switch back to Colgate this one I feel
like I can really see a difference
especially the Colgate optic white
mouthwash the only
thing I don't like about this is that it
doesn't have the freshest taste to it so
the crest 3d white definitely makes your
like breasts smell better but this one
is a good whitening one so if you're
like really psycho about toothpaste or
whatever you could go in with a
different one and then use this like
whiten your teeth as a whitening
toothpaste but I swear by this and the
crest 3d white brand and this is the
mouthwash that I finished up the crest
3d white arctic fresh and again I feel
like this actually helps especially if
you're a coffee drink or a tea drinker I
drink the ton of coffee
Exhibit A this one does give you that
like minty kind of freshness to your
breath versus this guy all right I've
got a lot of wipes here to go through so
the first one are my all-time favorite
holy grail makeup wipes Neutrogena
makeup wipes this is what I talked about
earlier where if I am too lazy for an
oil cleanser and I just want to take off
all my makeup or if I just need to
quickly take off my makeup or whatever
I'll go in with these ones these I will
forever continue to repurchase I just
haven't found ones for my skin that I
like better what I usually do with wipes
that I try and don't like is if I don't
like them I just use them as swatch
removal wipes that's kind of what I did
with all three of the next ones I want
to talk about but these are the derma e
hydrating facial wipes I don't really
like wipes that I can't use on my eyes
so because these ones have hyaluronic
acid in them probably not a good idea to
use on your eyes I don't know just a
wild guess but these are supposed to be
hydrating didn't feel like they were
particularly hydrating I also feel like
they burned my skin a little bit and
since I can't use it on my eyes too it
just seems like kind of an unnecessary
step if I'm gonna use a white but rather
use them like this where I can just use
all over my face and my eyes so these I
would not repurchase I think these ones
actually were in PR so I wouldn't
purchase them Garnier skin active my
seller tell its these burned my eyes but
I felt like they really removed my
makeup well so I just stopped using them
on my eyes and face because they burned
but I did use these to remove swatches
and they do a good job of that these are
the AOA studio cucumber cleansing wipes
these are $1 from shot miss a eye maybe
I did try these on my eyes I feel like I
would have why would I have not to get
15 wipes in here so for a dollar it
looks like the other ones have about 25
wipes they do get less wipes in here ten
less wipes but third dollar too
my gold I packed these are actually a
different brand I think these ones were
from the fabfitfun box though these are
just under eye mask my favorite ones are
the ones I mentioned in my Amazon
must-haves video I'll link those down
below too and I'll link the things that
I like that I'm talking about down below
this is a conditioner that comes in the
l'oreal preference hair color that has
been my favorite route dye lately
because the blue-black shade is actually
blue-black it's hard to find a
blue-black dye that really has a lot of
blue in there and that one does so i
just used up the conditioner usually in
haircolor kits you get a whole tube of
conditioner like this that can last a
few times and I always really liked the
conditioners that come in here because
they make your hair like super shiny and
moisturize feeling so they tend to be
really nice I really like the Garnier
ones too these are the number seven
instant results hydrogel eye mass I feel
like these did nothing they have this
kind of purplish tint to them where it
makes it look like it's doing something
because they do give your under eyes
kind of like a super subtle glow just
because they have actual like not
Sparkle but they have a little bit of
luminous something in there as far as
like just moisturizing and doing
something I didn't feel like this did
anything so I definitely wouldn't
purchase those this was the accurate and
Chloe being incredibly clear sheet mask
BHA white willow cucumber for comedor
oily skin I definitely had dry skin when
I use this but as I picked up at Whole
Foods I tried it out in the Whole Foods
beauty products video where I tested a
bunch of stuff from Whole Foods and I
did up to you guys in description box in
there but I just felt like this didn't
really do anything at the beginning when
I first picked this up I thought a face
mask with DHA and it could sound like a
good idea and it doesn't it's not a bad
idea but I just feel like that's
probably one of those ingredients that
you have to consistently use to see a
difference in your skin so paying like
five bucks or whatever for a one time
sheet mask that has it in it probably
not worth it and for my skin I just
wouldn't repurchase this like I'm having
a lot of wooden tree purchases right now
this I got at t.j.maxx it's just a hand
soap it was $4.99 and this is the eeo
she or she who knows aromatherapy it had
lime peppermint and orange peel
essential oils
this one this hand soap I didn't feel
like really cleansed your hands it
definitely felt like you could feel the
oils in there I almost just made your
hands smell good and it was kind of
moisturizing because of the oils
didn't feel like it was a really like
cleansing kind of soap so if I had any
kind of foundation or anything on my
hands I was trying to get off I would
have to use something else first and
then go in with this I probably wouldn't
repurchase this brand but if it smell
really good used up another hair mask so
hair mask by the way I usually use every
time I wash my hair because I only wash
my hair about once a week so when I do a
hair mask especially with the extensions
I want to keep them nice and moisturized
I just put it usually on dry hair and
just like leave it in my hair for an
hour or two and then rinse it out and
then you do my usual shampoo and
conditioner I use the Garnier
strengthening treat one-minute hair
masque I'm just now noticing them that
said one minute
whoops that might be why it wasn't the
best for me because I think this is a
protein it's a strengthening so if this
is a protein here mess that might be why
because you don't want to leave protein
on your hair for that long or like used
too much protein in your hair products
it can actually cause your hair to be
like too dry and crispy and like break
and do the opposite of what you want so
maybe that's why I didn't like this but
I did like the scent of this it says
banana extract which I thought was
interesting
Sam Sherman always talks about the
bodyshop banana shampoo and conditioner
and I never thought that I would want to
put something banana on my hair until I
smelled this it kind of smells like
scented play-doh but I oddly like it
okay it actually smells exactly like
scented play-doh but it grows on you it
smells pretty good but I went through
this so fast this lasted me two uses I
don't feel like it made it any softer or
any different like I said if anything I
feel like it made it a little bit more
dry but that could have been my folks
they left it on for too long this is
another conditioner that came in a hair
color container but this is the Clairol
nice and easy 3 step 3 this one I really
like this makes my hair feel super soft
it says for brunettes I have three brow
gels here don't ask me how these all run
out around the same time but this is the
ultimate e brow 10 in deep this has been
one of my favorites for the longest
amount of time mostly because I love the
shade of this it's a nice deep brown
color where it's not too warm I really
liked the AOA go brow I think it was
called it's like totally worn off this
is a dollar from shop miss a but this
dried out so quick not right out I just
went through it so quick like I feel
like there's barely any product in here
I will continue to buy this out just
because it's a dollar and I really liked
the color of it this one is the Loreal
brow stylist boosting set I love this
comb
one here because this one is just so
nice to apply you just brush it on ooh
Wow okay that actually had a little bit
left on there that I was not expecting
lesson something like right on the tip
so I just actually got a lot out this
one I love the comb to it because it
just makes it super easy to get right
where you want it and I really like it
for the front of my brows right here
because you can just comb upwards the
shade of this is fine for more natural
brow if I was doing really natural
makeup I would reach for this one where
I just want to basically like cover the
foundation of my brows but it's not my
like go-to favorite eyebrow color I
would definitely reach for these two
over this one okay we've just got a few
more things here so I actually have
another toothpaste the other one I was
talking about the crest 3d white wow
this is really curled in there and like
I said I just kind of switched between
the two of these 3d white strips by the
way those made my teeth so freakin
sensitive but the toothpaste is great
okay this mask was so bad this is the
formula ten point 0.6 I have one of
their other face masks a peel off one
that I didn't mind but this one did not
dry down and it also just was so like
sticky jelly feeling and I couldn't
actually peel it off because it didn't
dry down I didn't even put a super thick
layer on because I know with peel mask
usually I have to do a thinner layer so
that obviously dries you can peel off
this one just did not dry down it was
just like chilling with jelly on my face
it says it's supposed to be illuminating
raspberry and acai and I did not find it
to be illuminating at all definitely
would pass on this this last empties is
one of my favorite face masks for dry
skin that I found this is the nug face
mask soothing it has shea butter and
chamomile extract in it it makes my skin
feel so plump and hydrated I'm pretty
sure I've talked about this pour in a
raisin rejects video if you have dry
skin try this out you can get multiple
uses out of this one little pod thing is
nice to have these for traveling and
stuff I recently tried again the origins
I want to say it's called the drink up
night mask it's the one in the little
green bottle and that made me break out
so bad so that went in the donate bin I
definitely will not be using that again
on my skin it visibly made me break out
that's the first time since being off a
keychain that I've broken out so it's
definitely from that mass so I will not
be using that I'll be sticking to no go
over here right so those are all my
recent products
used-up tweet me photos if you guys save
your trash to of stuff that you saved up
because I find that so interesting and
if you enjoyed this video don't forget
to give it a thumbs up let me know if
you want me to keep saving my trash and
if you want empties videos to continue
I'm in a weird empties phase right now I
really enjoy watching them I really
enjoyed doing them quickly let me tell
you what's on the rest of my face
so for lips I use this NARS Umbra some
oh my blushes NARS orgasm a highlight is
also an artist and you realize that this
shade right here which I love it's like
a really pretty light peachy kind of
shade it looks different on your face it
looks a lot lighter all of my eye shows
are the Anastacio soft glam palette
today and that I think is everything oh
I actually tried this as a highlight
first this is the new NARS orgasm
illuminating powder if any of you have
been curious about this and you're
around my skintone it is too dark it
looks like more of a blush shade on my
skintone so I can't use this as a
highlight but that's why it went over it
with this guy I love you guys thanks for
watching see you my next video
