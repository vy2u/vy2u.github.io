this is the first alright so today we
have a shadow shoe so like I'm wearing
right now
got a little bit wild this morning I
don't know I just felt like I had to put
green lipstick on my face so we're also
gonna be tasting the love with food
deluxe box we're just gonna eat and put
on makeup you guys seem to like these
videos so we're gonna keep them coming
if you haven't heard of love with food
where you been it's basically a good way
to test out healthy snacks without like
fully committing and buying them their
monthly boxes so if you like something
from the box you can go on and purchase
in bulk they're three different boxes
and they all start at $8 I do have kept
off codes for you guys down below
something that I'm personally a big fan
of and why I really love love with love
love with foods every time a deluxe box
is purchased they donate to a local food
bank so all the boxes purchase through
my link get down into a seattle food
bank i'll leave the exact one down below
I just think that's awesome love with
food if you want to see how I got this
look you're in the right place just keep
watching alright so I already have my
foundation on I'm actually in the middle
of filming a first impression right now
on the mac prolongwear waterproof
foundation I am starving right now and I
didn't eat breakfast tasting like salty
things will be interesting right now but
we're gonna do it it's like 10:00 a.m.
by the way first thing we're gonna taste
our use banana chips these are crispy
free chips this sounds the most
breakfast tea out of the whole box we're
gonna ease into this these are so cute
look at that good no it tastes a little
bit like savory to me like and not as
sweet as I hope everyone be tasty brand
organic fruit snacks
feel free to sand no high fructose corn
syrup I mayn't that entire thing right
now okay so I found this brush off of
ebay I believe eBay or Amazon and link
it down below it was like five dollars
or less than that super cheap and remind
me of the NARS eater brush and so I
wanted to try this out and see if it's a
good alternative for you guys there's no
sister out by contouring my face with
the my sculpted face palette this is my
Holy Grail and I just take this middle
fade right here and let's just go to
town shall we
it feels like this foundation is still
yes foundation still a bit sticky so I'm
just gonna pounce more than
Jarett blendin this brush just makes it
easy to get right in the hollow of your
cheek bones so you can't really mess it
up so you can see that line now I'm just
gonna kind of blend it upwards the
highlight that I've been in freakin love
with lately I mentioned this in my July
some of this drivers and rejects video
this is just the light pink highlight in
this palette when you actually put on
your face it just looks white not like
light pink perfect if you have pale skin
and I feel like I'm doing this before my
blush and then like the blush just helps
to blend everything out like look at
that look at that highlight I'm also
gonna put a tiny bit of this down the
bridge of my nose nothing says breakfast
like for gummies they're really good
okay the next breakfast tea item I could
find here is this biscotti this is the
deluxe box surfin USA is the biscotti
yet oh I think you actually already ate
one of these I was like running to the
airport and I grabbed a couple things on
this box this and these lollipops are
super good lemon almond biscotti says
biting into this biscotti is like a
sprinkle of sunshine hint of vanilla and
a hearty almonds you remember this being
really good hmm for blush we're gonna
use the elf peachy keen blush this is
one of my all-time favorite blushes
pretty peachy shimmery kind of color I
think we're gonna go for like a warm
bronzy summery what a crazy look color
before we move on to the rest of the
makeup I'm just going to spray some
setting spray this is my favorite
L'Oreal setting spray I do this every
single day with my foundation so I feel
like that's a fair comparison I freaking
love it stuff I could like shower in
this stuff pretty much do okay so for my
crease color on my eyes I'm just going
to take that same color from the a
cosmetics palette and we're just gonna
pop this in the crease totally forgot
the part of the eyes we have some
concealer on there so it should be good
to go all right dude I think that's all
of the semi breakfast D stuff
roasted seaweed snacks I actually really
like seaweed we have some Barenaked
coconut almond curry that sounds
interesting
I might throw up if I have curry right
now because it's like 10:00 in the
morning this was really great timing on
my part
it's unripe fruit strip this was in
strawberry and this was frickin bomb
this is just like a fruit roll-up kind
of thing simply toasted crunchy coconut
chips let's go with that first well I
like this packaging oh yeah I love
coconut chips so have these two this
one's like a super bronzy color by color
pop this is game face summer lovin which
was when I'm fair
lemon edition tie day one so I don't
know if I should use it but it's like my
favorite shade ever that color pop has
ever made I think we're gonna first go
in with this coppery one and then maybe
put a little bit of this on the lid if
we're feeling it so the best thing that
I found to apply color pop is with your
finger I'm just putting it up to that
crease color like open up check see how
stielike it looks so I'm just gonna put
a tiny bit of this on the inner corner
and this color is frickin amazing and I
just use the same finger great so I'm
just blending this on like the first
third of my eye and get that inner
corner real good I'm gonna take my pure
minerals soul matte palette which I
mentioned a few times I love this I'm
just going to take that deep brown shade
and blend a tiny bit of this in the
crease just to give some more definition
if you have hooded eyes like I do a
little bit the best way to find your
crease is just to look down and you'll
kind of see where your bone is and you
can even draw it a little bit higher and
I'm just gonna take a super fluffy
blending brush blend it out ladies I'm
just gonna take some of the colors in
here to blend out on the lower lash line
you guys can take any kind of warm brown
tones that you have this camel camel
it's not a color yeah camel we're gonna
start to blend I'm gonna go back in with
game face my finger and just put a
little bit more of this near situation
it's a little she's gonna put a little
bit more on the legs like I blended some
of that away for eyeliner I'm going to
try out this Milani eye tech perfection
liquid
eyeliner I've never tried this before
I'm assuming that you're supposed to
hold it like this and then change it for
the flick to go up
definitely not as black as Physicians
Formula I'm kind of having to lie creepy
over just to get the black line all
right so the wing was pretty easy if we
can flick again and just mess it up
don't you love that alright not horrible
but not super impressed and I still
can't get this lid on right so just to
connect that wing to the bottom lash
line I'm gonna go in with a liner brush
and just some dark brown eyeshadow and
we're just gonna that lady's connect I'm
just gonna go back in with that lighter
color I'm still mad spell it and just
blend it out I'm just gonna apply some
white eyeliner to my waterline if I can
balance a mirror and do this all at the
same time
okay lashes are on I use socialize
fixing it vixen again these are just
literally perfect they go with every
single look they open up your eyes
they're like doll-like but not too much
we're gonna try some barbecue ships
surprisingly this sounds are really good
right now never had barbecue chips for
breakfast this is the first this is the
one potato two potato kettle potato
chips Hawaiian barbecue mmm these are
amazing
four bottom lash mascara wet and wild
make a link if you're looking for a good
mascara that doesn't transfer to your
concealer or lower lash line or whatever
is is this is it I think my favorite
things in this month's box the barbeque
chips and the fruit snacks or something
about the consistency of these that's so
good I feel like you would probably wear
any kind of lip with this like a coral
would look really good this is hello pop
Ouija but I just woke up and I really
wanted to put green on my face so we're
gonna do one thing I've ever worn green
lipstick so this is la splash smitten
lip tint mousse in guinea najimi this
formula stays on for freaking ever of
handyman coming to help me with some
apartment stuff after this
so this is going to be interesting I
just prefer the wake of these go on over
the colour-pop so much better all right
I think I'm diggin in the green lip kind
of feel like a tree right now but I
think it can work what do you guys think
I kind of want to just wear this when
the handyman comes and just film his
reaction all right so this is the final
look if you guys liked this video give
