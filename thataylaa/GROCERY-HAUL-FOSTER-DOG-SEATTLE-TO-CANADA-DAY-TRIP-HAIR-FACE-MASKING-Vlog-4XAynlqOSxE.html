mood so I figured we'd start off this
vlog here I just went grocery shopping
I'm having a major like self what sorta
much more I worked out what went to the
chiropractor went to the doctor tip
Snoopy on a long walk went to the
grocery store about to get drinks with
my friend leader so I'm having just uh
taking the kind of a day off today let's
do a little grocery haul so I can put
all this stuff away I'm like squatted
right now but we're gonna do this fairly
quickly cuz I gotta get out of here and
like a half hour and at the eat lunch no
time so it's 2:45
oh he's wakin up
he's like mostly deaf and he's I would
say probably like 70% blind he can see
my face and he can see shapes and stuff
so he doesn't know I'm actually here
until he like sees a shadow or something
okay so for the last I want to say
probably three weeks I've been eating so
much healthier overall than I usually do
and I've also been doing Jillian
Michaels 30 day shred for the last how
long has it been probably like week and
a half now maybe two weeks I can see a
difference already whenever I'm trying
to like just get toned and stuff I
always do drilling my bowls they're
gonna shred I swear by it work so good
it's intense and there's only like 25
minutes long and I usually just cut back
on the carbs and like bread and stuff
and I thought so I see the biggest
difference in my body so that's usually
what I do and then I just eat a ton
more vegetables and like actual healthy
things so that's what I've been doing so
first thing I got is ground turkey
because I want to make some turkey
meatballs and I ordered a spiralizer I
want to try doing like the zucchini
noodles and put the turkey meatballs
with that got some all-natural crunchy
peanut butter this one was on sale for
like half price so I figured out try it
we got some wine not healthy I got two
things of light chicken of the sea I
think I'm gonna make this for lunch
right now I got little rice cakes have
some chopped green onions already by the
way I have like five million water
bottles that need to be filled up back
there probably mix this with some like
light Mayo I also got Greek yogurt which
I might try mixing in instead of saying
the light Mayo and then put in some
green onion and put it on these rice
cakes so here's the Greek yogurt I just
got a giant thing because mazes for tons
of stuff I got some pepper genies I love
some pepper Chinese frozen strawberries
just first movies I've been making
protein smoothies after I workout I have
like a way free one that I use I think
it's a pee based protein because if you
have migraines away it usually does not
help the situation so I just mix in some
strawberries like half a banana spinach
and then the protein powder stuff I was
watching Alexandre Garza of Sandra Garza
did you have a good nap so Snoopy oh you
are so cute you are so cute
look at that guy what a guy you are
so Snoopy I'm fostering right now he's
available for adoption at Seattle humane
hopefully by the time this vlog goes up
he'll be adopted
because you need a home oh good where
was I okay so I'm making lower calorie
pizza think about getting cauliflower
crust but I didn't feel like going to
Trader Joe's and when they had at
Safeway was like 10 bucks which was kind
of ridiculous so I ended up just getting
this roasted garlic tomato sauce that
I'm going to use as a sauce this doesn't
have any like added sugar or anything
it's literally just tomato garlic olive
oil so spinach which you'll probably put
on the pizza too but also just for
smoothies for the pizza I got this parts
game mozzarella that I'm just gonna chop
up and put on the pizza I wanted to do
like a low-carb PITA
kind of pizza but I couldn't really find
one that was low-carb so I just got one
that they had I got this idea from
Alexander Garza high I was watching a
bunch of her vlogs the other day I'm
like hooked right now turkey pepperoni
and then these pita pockets only 100
calories so they're looking high
calories pretty good but I'm just gonna
warm these up in the oven with like the
other stuff and bake it and make some
semi healthier cute so then like Tommy
pizza chipotle cheddar salad kit just
sounds like a quick lunch kind of thing
the more ground turkey this was actually
already seasoned for tacos so I'm gonna
make taco bow bowls some egg whites for
the turkey meatballs and then also just
to have literally just drop the entire
thing in tomato sauce minced onions and
garlic powder and Tapatio I need to
shave back young me I've heard good
things about these patties just for like
quick lunches and stuff I've never tried
this it's a coconut curry the vegan
power Bowl these are breaded so like not
the best but they're actually pretty low
calorie they have 170 calories but these
are so good if you've never happy as the
morning star they're like the veggie
patties but they're buffalo chicken
these they're so good some no fat beans
for the breed of bowl kind of thing so
sodium chicken broth because this little
guy has trouble drinking water and
chicken broth has been helping a lot
they're just like a tiny / - chicken
broth in his water and he'll drink it
I've never tried these but these are
wasabi crunchy chickpeas so many good
for like a quick snack some grapes wash
those or avocados there's a couple more
in there and then just some quick
already cooked brown rice didn't you
just microwave these bananas
cucumber these I thought looked good I
just like a bite I don't need a whole
lot of sweets at night
just needs like one bite of chocolate
and I'm totally satisfied so this is
dark chocolate covered banana is also a
good just sweet tooth kind of thing
these are the jello chocolate-vanilla
swirl they're sugar-free they only have
60 calories in them um Pete's hiccups
dark gross we got some white corn for
the bowls but that was everything that I
got I gotta get going make some food so
I'll see you guys later
look at that face autofocus what does
this camera doing just want to see your
pretty face there you go
look at those eyes he's so silly I just
filmed a video
I think it'll be up after this vlog is
gonna be up so don't tell you guys what
it is but it's a good one right think so
I've never seen it done before you ever
the cutest little guy yeah you are
yeah you are what that's a big one so I
just filmed I think I'm gonna make the
Mexican bowl things for lunch and I'm
kind of gonna gonna kinda get all that
stuff and I'm gonna put them in
container so I can have lunch for like
the next couple days with that too so
I'm gonna make like the ground turkey
and the bowls and everything have two
videos I need to edit today I'm gonna
schedule
Friday's video today is Thursday take
him on the long walk
I think rage is coming over to make
dinner I want to make those pizza things
that I was talking about so probably
show you guys that - I'm in a weird
cooking mood right now I'm also gonna do
Jillian Michaels
he gets so weird sometimes and just like
stares that stuff like he'll be in the
corner of a room just staring at the
wall for a long time poor guy he's
pretty good about getting around though
he can definitely see shapes and stuff
so he knows like what to avoid sometimes
he'll run into the mirror I Boo Boo's he
can definitely see my face he's also
mostly deaf I don't remember if I said
that alright some Mexican Bulls are done
this is what I'm eating right now plate
doesn't look the prettiest but it's so
good I just put the taco mix corn fat
for your 5 beans with a little bit
cheese half an avocado some turkey with
all the seasoning on it and then these
are the three that we'll have for
lunches or whatever I have a few more
avocados so when I go to keep them up
all basically just put the avocado on
this is my favorite hot sauce so friggin
good help in yo and then also have top
tea over here so I worked out did
Jillian Michaels level two today
seven and I took him on a walk Rach is
coming over I'm getting the pizza stuff
ready and then it'll probably go on like
a longer walk with him when you get
typer in a little bit got my wine going
this is the you remember if I should
yeah I think I showed you guys all this
I'm gonna be making the little pita
pizzas this is the final pita pizza bro
you're all blurry
I look good they're nice and light
crispy on the bottom you see the cutest
or what you just follow me everywhere
haha you should take a break so I have
some really attractive buns in right now
because I just did a hair mask what did
I use here's a little pink under here I
used the L'Oreal total repair mask this
is one of my favorite hair masks do you
like this one sent your favorite to
almost out of this one but this I feel
like actually does something and I like
to put it on my dry hair one because of
the tape and extensions but also I feel
like I just it does more if I leave it
on for like an hour on dry hair and I'll
just rinse it out my hair is like super
soft but with the extensions I just
section it off so I don't put it like
right up to the tape but then at the top
on my real hair I'll bring it all the
way up so my hair mask is on I wanted to
try the drunk elephant TLC baby facial
I've heard really good things about this
it's like a 20-minute AJ mask basically
it's like a resurfacing I guess you
could call it a face mask basically like
a resurfacing treatment why is this
camera having so many issues focusing
lately and at the same time of this I'm
just playing back my footage I always
watch the entire video through before I
export it just to make sure that
everything's good to go so I'm just
playing it back this one's like a half
hour long it's 35 minute long shadow in
jammu so I'm like trying to get other
stuff done long doing this just wash it
off and I wanted to show you guys out
here and natural light and my skin does
feel very smooth especially like my
forehead I feel like it looks really
nice and smooth right now you're not
supposed to use it more than like once
or twice a week I'm pretty sure so I'll
keep using it like
now but right now it looks really nice
we're in the Boush art garden and our
bus almost broke down did kind of break
down on the way up here it takes like 40
minutes to get from where they drop us
off to up here and that's I think it's a
free bus I think it didn't the tickets
or whatever
Justin how we're walking around the
garden and chill here for a little bit
and then we're gonna head back down to
try out some donuts
so it is the next morning I just made
some breakfast I already edited this
blog that you guys are seeing right now
just whipped up some eggs we've got red
pepper green onion regular onion avocado
I'm gonna pop some
Tapatio on there got my coffee
fish-and-chips yesterday we're
definitely not the plan but whatever I
was a cheat day I'm traveling I
definitely don't eat healthy because
he's like that's part of traveling is
good food my friend wants me to read
this book let me know if you guys have
read this only read like 30 pages so far
but we'll see let me know if any of you
guys have read this down below that push
you showing off your butt have you been
doing a Brazilian booty workout don't
mind my really thriving plant
so today is Sunday I'm pretty sure
pretty sure I'm just going to work out
finish editing this video hopefully edit
a second video and then I need to run to
Petsmart to get some more of his food I
need to return a couple things I think
I'm gonna go run those errands I might
be going to like a flea market thing in
Magnuson Park I'm gonna say thank you to
Victoria clipper for sending us out to
Victoria yesterday it was such a fun
quick trip I wish we had like a few more
hours there just by the time we got
there and made it up to the gardens and
stuff we really only had like a few
hours so super cool that in a day trip
you can literally take about up to canva
I would totally do it again for a day
trip especially now since we've already
done two Gardens I think I want to go
back and just do like a day of stone off
my throat a day of like downtown and
exploring and stuff and eating a bunch
of you guys on the Instagram recommended
I think it's called Emperor's Donuts or
something like that the Emperor's Donuts
so you're trying to go there but we
totally ran out of time so when I go
back well for sure to go there and the
clip were also goes to San Juan Islands
so I think I'm gonna do that to go to
San Juan I would way rather take like
trains and boats to get around it just
makes it more fun and it's quick and
easy
