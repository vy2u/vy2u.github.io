so I thought I would do a talk through
get ready with me kind of video because
I've never done this before usually when
I do my makeup I'm kind of like in a
zone so we'll see how this works so it's
my last day at home so I'm going to the
airport today so I want to wear makeup
that's gonna last all day I get into my
college town at like 8 p.m.
me being my smart self forgot my keys in
my apartment so I get to chill at my
friend's house for 4 hours until my
roommates get back all right might have
to turn the fan on in like two seconds
because I'm legit sweating for a
foundation today I mixed the maybelline
superstay foundation in san beige with
Kat Von D's l42 which is discontinued
and I'm super unhappy about but what are
you gonna do well in that end I use the
Sigma f80 2 round kabuki which I
mentioned in my March freeze and rejects
video I think yes that one well I really
might have to take a fan break I have to
like consciously remember to talk to the
camera when I'm doing this is why I
usually film voiceover tutorials because
multitasking is clearly a challenge for
me on another note I shaved my legs for
the first time in like three weeks today
literally felt like I was mowing down Oh
on I'm gonna go in with the NYX HD
photogenic concealer and I just picked
this up at all - a few days ago and I
have been really liking it it's good for
fair skin because it is definitely light
enough for under the eye the consistency
kind of reminds me of Mac's pro longwear
because it is a little bit I want to say
thicker but it like dries pretty fast I
just blend it out with my finger
and then pack I will be back in my
normal setup tonight so the next video
you guys see will probably be in back at
home my other home I've been gone for
two weeks which is crazy to me because I
don't know
Spring Break always goes by so fast by
the way thanks for all the super
positive feedback on my mark trace and
rejects videos you guys are awesome and
I definitely think I'm gonna try the roc
eye cream few people mention that then I
also like to take this what is on my
foot
blend that out with the same Sigma brush
I hope this isn't gonna be like a half
hour long because that's usually how
long it takes me to get ready just got a
button down the dope chin and done I'm
sayin so then I like to set my under eye
concealer with the Physicians Formula
translucent correcting powder this is
literally probably the best thing that's
ever happened to me if you have Parrish
skin it's light enough to set your under
eyes without them being the same color
as your face or darker all of which has
happened if your skin is this light you
could definitely use this all over I
find that I kind of look like a Geisha
if I use this all over my face or at
least that's what my mother doors tells
me thanks mom
I just put this in the parts that I want
highlight it on my face this brush I
probably used for like five years now
not the same one but elf and I really
don't think there's a powder brush
comparable even like high-end like Sigma
and I'm gonna take my Physicians Formula
telc free Carter foundation and this is
in the lightest shade this is a tiny bit
too dark for me so that's why I don't
put this like all over positions formula
is one of the only brands like powders
that doesn't break me out so if you have
acne prone skin definitely try out
Physicians Formula like nine out of ten
foundations will break me out since I'm
just kind of chilling today I don't
think I'm gonna go for bronzer I'm just
going
use the bush that I use every day which
is the pearlescent pink blush by when
loud which I also mentioned in my March
trees and rejects video which will be
linked right here you can click right
there if you want to see it the brush
I'm using is a morph stippling brush
this is perfect for the wet and wild
blushes because they are so pigmented
this gives you just the right amount
product just blends everything nicely
these can be kind of tricky to work with
because they are so pigmented well I'm
just chit-chatting it up with you guys I
swear the Mac video is coming the
lighting video is coming every other
video that you guys have requested is
coming the Mac video has taken me
forever to get up because it is one of
those videos that I need to like make
notes on so I don't forget to tell you
guys anything and it's just gonna be a
lot of planning on my part so that's why
it's taking a year and a half to get up
I also am going to have another girl
both grad episode coming soon because
you guys really like that and it's
helpful for a lot of people who are
graduating this year or soon just put on
the mary-lou manizer by the balm
highlight I'm going to comb out my brows
I have a whole brow routine which will
be linked down below if you want to see
it so I'm not going to go in depth about
what I'm doing because this is literally
what I do every single day in my life
and talking is definitely not happening
right now
one day I kind of want to just wear one
brow and go around and see like the
looks that people give me feel like that
would be mildly entertaining try to do
that and film it make sure you guys
comment down below if you like this kind
of video because we can do it more often
if you like it I don't know what it
would be called need some kind of catchy
title whoo that was one of those days
when the brows were just working for me
yeah I mean it's always going to be a
good day when your browser on point the
comics made their lip balm in the shape
of eos that'd be the greatest thing ever
so this is the point in my makeup
routine where is it fluoride spraying my
makeup setting spray I just have a baby
one with me right now since I am mid
travels right now this is a skin and
Navia spray but I think urban decay is
inside of here because I ran out it's
gonna Navy yet I don't really know how
many sprays I do I just kind of do
whatever I'm feeling book that fans not
too well but I would really think I
might pass out if the fans not I don't
really know what I'm doing for my eyes
today I honestly hate I have all my
makeup in my Betsey Johnson bag right
now and it's so obnoxious trying to dig
through everything so I just have it all
over the counter okay where's my Paint
Pot can't find my Mac's Paint Pot to
prime my eyes so I'm using the Ben Nye
cream stack up in white this is one of
those things I just found laying around
my room here I would really have like
boxes of makeup at home so when I come
home it's kind of like I'm going makeup
shopping all over again
reminds me of the next jumbo eye pencil
in milk except it is a little creamier I
hope I didn't just get that on my brow
Oh wonderful for my crease I'm using elf
matte eyeshadow in brick an attempt to
turn off the fan and hope I don't die
also my mom is on the treadmill right
now like going to town with the TV on
so I hope you guys can't hear that props
to that woman man I am half of her age
and I don't think I'm exercise as much
in my whole life as she does in one week
so I just popping this on the crease
this El Dorado is super pigmented so I
usually like to tap it in the cap so you
don't get too much product on and I'm
just like to feather it out out here to
make the eyes appear a little bit bigger
the sweating is beginning so I'm going
to use Stila grande we're just going to
take this on my finger and put this all
over the lid ooh I like that super
pretty color see this is what's awesome
about rediscovering makeup so then I'm
gonna go in with fur from The Naked 2
palette using the Sigma e30 pencil brush
I'm just gonna put this on my inner
corner then I'm going to take brick
again on that same pencil brush and just
run that on the bottom lash line since
you don't want fallout make sure you tap
off that brush mom I'm gonna get reviews
and I get Rubio's for lunch with dad
yeah you're already beautiful she just
turned down the burrito
we're not related I'm going on with the
Physicians Formula I booster two and one
eyeliner definitely not gonna be able to
talk during this so the RV um I'm gonna
need to bind you one of these because
this is not nearly as black as it used
to be I got my wings on for my scary's
I'm gonna be starting with Mac's
prepping prime I use this every single
day it gives your lashes a really nice
coat before actually applying your
mascara and I swear it's helped with
like breakage and all that kind of stuff
for mascara I'm using L'Oreal voluminous
like I do every single day I'm like
dreading packing right now don't you
guys miss the good old days when your
parents pack for you splash did
everything for you I'm using the wine
world make a length mascara for my
bottom lashes I wish my dad would tell
you what they took a screenshot of no
idea what I'm doing for lips today I
think I might do a coral lip I'm kind of
feeling it mates so V is this gorgeous
coral color that I rediscovered in my
makeup collection here there we go
