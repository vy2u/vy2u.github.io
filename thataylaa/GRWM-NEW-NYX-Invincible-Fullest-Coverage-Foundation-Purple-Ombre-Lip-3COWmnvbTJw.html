ready with me shadow and schmooze kind
of video when with a neutral kind of eye
and obviously a little more intense lip
I've been sick for like the last four
days so whenever you finally do your
makeup after you're sick I feel like I
just need to put everything on my face
and like go crazy so I haven't anyone
else still a little bit stuffy and a
little out of it so pretty warning in my
last NYX unboxing video which you can
watch right here and it will open new
window
I mentioned the NYX invincible full
coverage Foundation and you guys wanted
to see a first impressions video on this
I did use this in this video instead
because I kind of like swatch it on my
face and it was way too dark for my skin
so you'll see how I ended up wearing it
but we made it work I've been really
trying to switch it up lately with the
stuff that I use because I feel like I
tend to use like the same ten products
every single day so I used a lot of
different things for this video that I
usually don't reach for so that's
exciting what else I have a ton of
brand new makeup that I've been waiting
to try for you guys on camera which is
in this pile over here so be expecting
some more get ready with me videos like
how I just said how I have so much
makeup and literally after I film this
I'm going to go to Fred Meyer and see if
they have any new limited edition stuff
makeup addict right here so if you want
to see me get ready and we can talk and
you can see how I did this look then
just keep watching well the hair is
looking cray okay I think I'm going to
use the new NYX invincible full coverage
foundation I didn't want to do a first
impressions on this alone because I do
have to mix it in with the Manic Panic
dreamed home because it is way too dark
for my skin typical the lightest shade
isn't quite enough so I'm just going to
put a couple pumps of this this just
helps to lighten any foundation that you
have full of their video I'm lightening
your foundations the consistency of this
is super creamy super creamy the show
told yous before I've already primed my
face with the Murad pore in line
minimizing hydrator which is a sample
that I got from Sephora
it feels like very cooling on the skin
almost like a gel the scent was
out-of-this-world horrible I don't know
couldn't really deal with the Sun so I'm
just going to blend this out with my
morphe brushes kabuki brush
so the coverage is pretty good I feel
like at least mixed in with the
dreamtone it's like a medium coverage
Emily kind of a sad and finish to it
it's not completely matte it was a
little difficult to blend out it kind of
feels more like a gel if that makes
sense then a cream or a liquid
foundation it is pretty thick hence why
they probably have it in a squeeze tube
rather than you know like a liquid
foundation bottle so I'm going to use a
different concealer than what I usually
show in videos this is the Revlon
age-defying targeted dark spot concealer
the lightest shade is too dark for my
skin so what I've been doing is just
putting a little bit on the back of my
hand and then mixing in like a super
tiny pump of the dreamtone in with it
just to lighten it up and just mix it on
the back of my hand and then I'm just
going to put this under my eyes in the
areas where I usually like to highlight
my face
I'll put a little bit more under my nose
just to cover up this forgettin random
zit don't wear makeup in like three days
since I've been sick so I don't know
where this thing came from to set my
under eye concealer like always I'm
using my Physicians Formula correcting
powder it's light enough and it makes my
concealer not crease
so for the rest of my face I ordered
this off of a hot look and I've been
really liking it it's the laura geller
powder bouncing brighton foundation in
porcelain actually light enough for my
skin which is rare not only that but it
gives you this gorgeous kind of like
natural glow I don't even know how to
describe it I mean I guess you'll see it
in a second I didn't really want to like
this stuff because it is kind of pricey
guess I'm going to be repurchasing this
now brush I like to use to apply it is
my Real Techniques lush brush which I've
never used for blush in my life
I don't know if you guys can see on
camera but it just kind of gives the
effect of not really wearing a powder it
looks much more natural than my powders
usually tend to set on my face then for
blush guys I'm switching it up you know
I'm all about my wet and wild blush and
pearlescent pink but I think we're going
to switch it up and use my matte blush
in seem to be seen this was part of one
of the limited ition collections I got
this from work I don't even I don't know
you could probably find this on eBay or
something like that
I love the glow that this gives I feel
like this with the laura geller
powder is just like perfection
got a spray my Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray
they addicted to the stuff can't live
without it I'm going to put on my brows
and then I'll be right back if you want
to see how I do my brows I have a whole
other routine which will be linked down
below so you can check that out got the
brows on I've already primed my eyes
with the hard candy eyeshadow primer
love this stuff I think we're just going
to go simple with the eyes and use the
Naked 3 palette because I want to kind
of do like a crazy purple lip it's what
happens when you don't do makeup for
like 4 days things get crazy so I'm
going to go in with nooner from The
Naked 3 palette and this is my favorite
shade in the palette it's like this dark
warm kind of taupe colored by the way if
you're wondering why I'm not talking
well I'm actually doing my makeup
editing these chitchat get ready with me
videos takes me literally 4 hours
because I have to go through like 50
minutes of footage so I figure if I
don't talk while I'm actually applying
the makeup then we can like speed up
this whole process make everyone's life
so a little bit easier
whoa hair about to go in my eyeball I'm
going to take nooner and just blend that
on the bottom lashline
maybe I should like not put the pallet
right from the camera
is almost enviable got it then I'm going
to take strange on my finger and just
put that all over the lid this is just
like a mat kind of cream color
I'm going in with my physician's formula
shimmer brick love this stuff I
mentioned this in a few videos I'm just
going to use the lightest shade in here
and it's a shimmery white color this is
perfect for your inner corner give you
that little inner corner highlight you
know the stuff you can use on your face
as well it's like a face and eye kind of
little contraption thing
okay so then for liner I'm going to be
using my Milani eye tech extreme liquid
eyeliner and then also my Physicians
Formula one if I can find it my
Physicians Formula
eye booster I like to use this as like
the base line just because it's easier
and then this creates a really nice wing
it is really hard to do eyeliner when
you're wearing knuckle rings quite
challenging
I hope the fan is in too loud but I
literally think I might pass out if it's
not on
literally this thing makes it so easy to
do a wing I feel like you just have to
know how to draw a triangle and then you
can do a wing I'm going to go back in
with the naked 3 palette and I'm using I
don't even know what am i using maybe
factory or dark side which I use going
with Factory on just a liner brush and
run this on the outer third of my bottom
lash line
so I have new things to report in the
mascara department I know in every video
I rave about the L'Oreal voluminous
carbon black and I still love this still
my number one go-to mascara however I
have a newfound appreciation for the
Maybelline falsies volume express
mascara I think I didn't like it before
because you really have to get a hang of
the curved brush but once you figure it
out this stuff is amazing
I still like to use my Mac prep and
prime underneath the falsies so I'm
going to apply these and then I'll be
right back
I have my mascara on love this stuff
comment down below if you guys want a
video on how to apply the falsies in
mascara because I post your picture on
Instagram and I think a couple other
people initially didn't like it but I
think it's just really just think it's
how you apply it
makes a huge difference anyways what are
we doing oh I think we're going to go
for a purple ombre lip the two products
I'm going to be using are the Palladio
herbal lip liner don't exactly know what
makes this herbal this is in the shade
of blackberry you can get this from
Sally Beauty I actually really like this
it's a retractable liner this goes
really well with Mac's rebel lipstick
the bright purple shade I'm using pretty
zombie cosmetics 3 witches liquid
lipstick love this stuff it is amazing
super pigmented creamy formula dries
matte I think I mentioned this in the
favorites video
so once we have it lined like this I'm
going to go in with the purple color
can we just look at this frickin color
how beautiful is this
I'm just gonna let that dry and then I
think I'm going to darken it up with
like a black in the corners that's what
they're called now I'm going to go in
with black cat bye pretty zombie
cosmetics and because these have a doe
foot applicator it's a little there we
go it's a little tricky to get in a
small area so just going to take this on
a like concealer lip brush and I'm just
going to put this in the corners on my
lip
you
all right there we go purple black lip
so if you like this video and you like
chitchat you're ready with me shadow and
shrews kind of videos be sure to give it
a thumbs up so I know comment down below
with any products that you guys want me
to use in my next one I think that's all
I had to say I'm gonna go watch loss
because I'm an addict yes I'm watching
that show like five years later love you
guys thanks for watching see you my next
video fighting crap I forgot to use all
that stuff next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
