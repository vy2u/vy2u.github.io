schmooze get ready with me video I
already did my face makeup because I'm
doing a first impression on the
Illamasqua rich liquid foundation by the
time you're watching this it'll already
be up so I'll link it over here and you
can click that and it'll open a new
window window so in this video I'm
showing you how I did the rest of my
face so if you want to see how I did
this look and you want to hear me you
talk to myself in a room then here we go
alright so I'm going to start out by
taking my card kandi I primary this is
from Walmart it can get up to like five
bucks feel like I'm like having hot
flashes right now though I think today
we are gonna use the nude matte
eyeshadow palette this was like a
collabs up the right word between Wayne
Goss and polished choice I have a whole
other review on this if you want to see
it I love my eyeshadows just for like
daily basis kind of makeup look so I'm
just taking this shade right here from
the palette and I'm going to put this
all over my crease the big fluffy brush
how are you guys doing I like these type
of videos because I get to actually talk
to you guys and
also can try out new products and share
them with you without it being like a
formal type of review kind of thing
which is always nice what's new in my
life that's interesting the job search
continues if you phone me an Instagram
you know that I got an internship which
is really exciting it's like well I am
finishing up this year of school it is
such a shovel you guys finding a drop
for after college it's not even funny
I graduate in a month and it's just
super stressful not knowing where you'll
be or what you'll be doing if you'll be
employed or not and you know like I just
cannot believe that there's like six
weeks left of college ever it's kind of
insane like kind of going through a
mental breakdown slash have such mixed
emotions I can't tell if I'm excited or
sentimental it's a little bit of
everything I'm going to go in with this
like warm brown shade right here we're
just going to put this in our crease
again a little controversial on it this
brush is like pink but
just because bristles stay in the shiny
actual color this
gonna define it's a little bit more you
literally only want to put this right in
your face we don't want to go up any
more than we did with the other colors I
always wonder what age girls or guys
watched my videos so comment down below
and tell me how old you are and if
you're graduating college or if you're
graduating high school or if you're just
chilling and enjoying life you can tell
me that too then I'm going to go in with
my finger and use the lightest shade
right here this is a completely matte
shade there's one satin shade in this
palette which is actually really pretty
and I might add a little bit of that I'm
just putting this all over the lid for
the quality of these eyeshadows I think
this is super affordable it retails for
forty bucks but you can get it $10 off
but for 30 bucks I feel like this is
totally worth it I don't want to go like
choose movie or too intense so they do
have to go on campus right now I'm gonna
take this shade right here run this long
in the bottom lash line
then to just blown that out I'm going to
take that first shade that we've put in
our face and just learn that below the
darker shade and for the inner corner
I'm just going to take the third Street
in which is a little bit shimmery and
put this on the inner corner and we're
done with the shadows let's go in with
some eyeliner I'm using the Loni Zytek
extreme liquid eyeliner I use this
another get ready with me video and I'm
actually really liking this stuff it has
a super fine point so you can do a
really quick and easy wing after I
create that base kind of line I just
start to draw the shape of the wing I'm
going for it make like a triangle and
then fill it in that literally took like
10 seconds love this stuff Potter wings
on let's do some mascara first I've been
going with Mac's
crepin prime thing and you some L'Oreal
voluminous carbon black bottom lashes
and wet and wild and make a link okay
we've got our mascara on and I'm feeling
a little springtime festive so for lips
we must go
for lips I'm gonna be using a Milani lip
intense liquid color in shade pink brave
this has awesome 14 pigmentation it is
incredible and this smells like cake
take a look at that color usually these
brushes to me are kind of hard to apply
such a pigmented colors but it's so
stiff but not too difficult I usually
like to kind of let that dry and then go
in with another layer just to make it
last longer okay so that is the final
look if you like these kind of shadow
and schmooze videos be sure to click the
thumbs up button so I know comment down
below with what your favorite lip color
for spring is because I'm always on the
lookout for a good spring lip love you
