get ready with me video on the look I'm
wearing right now pretty much everything
I used in this video I have not used
before was feeling a little crazy neon
today as you can tell if you want to see
his look just keep watching candle got
our mood lighting
what's a youtuber without a candle
burning in the background right Oh
matching coffee cap I did my hair for
you guys our relationships getting real
so I have absolutely zero idea what
we're doing today on our face so I'm
going to be using the NYX honey do me up
for the first time it says that it has
honey gold flakes I feel like these gold
flakes are just gold aluminum foil has
this little spatula thing and kind of
reminds me of like chemistry class but
I'm just putting a little bit on my
finger and then I'm going to rub this
into the skin whoa super you're like
gooey smells very spa-like hoping this
doesn't break me out because I have some
pretty intense breakouts going on on the
chin it's from the new Maybelline BB
cream broke me out like crazy very mixed
feelings on that product but I'm not
even gonna use it anymore obviously
because it like literally caused me
cystic acne again on my chin so that's
awesome I don't know if I'm missing
something but I don't look very doing
yet comment down below if you guys want
a whole review on this stuff once I've
tried it out for a little bit I'm gonna
go in with my trusty Revlon Colorstay
because trying to tame the breakout on
my chin and I know for a fact that this
stuff does not break me out I'm gonna
mix a little bit of the NYX liquid
illuminator into here I've been really
liking this stuff if all my Instagram
you heard me rave about it but I just
put like a little tiny squirt in there
mix it in you can mix this in with your
foundation or just apply it to the
cheekbones for like a natural-looking
highlight I just really like it because
it blends really nicely and with your
blush and everything so it's not like
blush shimmer you know it just all
blends and the Revlon Colorstay is a
pretty matte finish so this helps to
just do me up
Oh
there'd my face yesterday so all the
foundations going on really nicely if
you want to see a video of me using
their hungover then I definitely have
that very viewing pleasure so if our
concealer I'm going to be trying the LA
girl Pro concealer I got this off of I
Kate house all the links for the
products will be down below heard
amazing things about this concealer from
mainly makeup artists on Instagram I
really hate the new by hello to the
YouTube world though YouTube message
well I really dislike how they have this
kind of brush applicator thing but it
looks like you could take it off I will
try later this is the lightest shade and
it is probably close to like an NC 25 if
not 30 it's super salmon based which is
good for covering up dark circles there
you go you can see how Orange it looks
against my skin so I definitely have to
mix it in with my NYX HD concealer in
lavender especially with a concealer I
don't know why you would make your
lightest shade this dark little redic
and we're just gonna go to town under
the eyes
this concealer is super affordable it's
only I think like $3 around there before
I powder the under eyes I'm going to add
a tiny bit more of the next illuminator
and I'm just using a small stippling
brush and I'm just gonna put this on the
top of my cheekbones
you can see it gives you such a pretty
highlight and blend it in with my
foundation brush taking it down the
bridge of the nose
set the under eye like always using my
trusty physician's formula correcting
powder favorite stuff
you can see how the highlighter still
kind of peeks through that and looks
really natural and for the rest of my
face using my laura geller balance and
brighten in love
feel like it applies the best with my
ELF powder brush on my forehead but then
for the rest of my face I like to use my
Real Techniques is actually the blush
brush but I don't know who could apply
blush with this it's freaking huge
but makeup applies so much better after
you don't have hair on your face this is
probably TMI we're going there coming
through the brows so if our brows are
gonna be using the anastasia dipbrow
pomade and this is in the shade dark
brown went to the lake yesterday it
stayed on through the water through the
Sun my brows didn't budge the brush I've
been using is this mini asked Ecotools
brush it actually comes in the mini
essential set which you saw if you
watched my makeup haul which I've been
mentioning a lot of the products in this
video from that haul so if you haven't
seen that you can go check that out you
literally need the tiniest bit of this
pomade pretty good stuff and no I
wasn't sent it or anything like that I
bought it myself off of Sephora so I
just like to kind of create that base
and then we're going to attach it
there we go that's basically how I've
been doing my brows lately I like to
leave the front end without product on
it I just think it looks more natural
and it kind of fades into your brow like
this is even a natural brow but how I do
it I hope you guys can hear the hobo
rapping right now great job my face is
still a little bit tacky so I'm not
going to put blush and bronzer on quite
yet so we're going to start with the
eyes random but I've been really liking
Maybelline instant age rewind to prime
my eyes I don't know it really helps the
eyeshadows be more pigmented and blend
out easily and I just like how easy it
is to apply half the time I don't use my
Mac Paint Pot just because I'm too lazy
to like dig my finger in there and scoop
the out so for eyes we're going to
be using the Smashbox full exposure
palette and by full exposure palette I
mean I have this paper s version from
Sephora this is a sample I didn't even
know these kind of things existed so I
think we're just gonna go for a matte
eye right yeah that's what I'm feeling
just sealing off the start with
this shade right here m3 woah weird you
know tell if I'm like getting product
right now oh there we go
this weird to anyone else so I'm going
to take this like taupe shade and I'm
just going to use my finger on this
because oh these are actually very
velvety this all over the lid
Penner wins we have like a watered down
chocolate milk go in with my Sigma e-40
brush and just blend all these together
usually windshield wiper motions then
we're going to smoke it out with the
darkest brown shade m1
pack the color on in the outer V and
then we're going to blend it in with the
Sigma e-40 afterwards and you can kind
of drag it in where it's just a blend
with that taupe color a little bit a few
people in the last shadow in choice
video
we're asking what my major is in what
field I'm going into I studied
international relations and marketing
going into the marketing industry so
what I'm doing can't really talk to you
guys that much about what's going on in
life right now because by the time
you're watching this pre recording
videos for like two weeks since I'm
going to be out of town and then moving
and all this stuff so I'm just blending
it in with this Sigma e-40 brush again
like this coffee is not kicking in
together I'm going to take whatever is
left over on the brush from that Brown
and put it on the bottom lash line I
don't even know what to do with this
thing now I'm putting this on my water
line to help open up the eyes before we
apply eyeliner and falsies and all that
kind of stuff I'm going to move on to
bronzer and blush or bronzer i'm using
Bahama Bhama Bahama boma Bahama Mama
from the balm I got this off of hot look
a flash sale site pretty deep so you
want to use a light hand if your skin is
close to mine
for blush I'm switching it up and using
the NYC color wheel which I'm pretty
sure is from like eighth grade I don't
know probably throw it out and get
anyone if I remember this is a pretty
freakin pigmented so I'm going to be
using my morphe stippling brush just to
get a tiny bit of product it's a nice
pink flush I guess think we're going to
skip out on the highlighter today
because we have a lot of doing things
going on on our face you can see the
highlighter peaking through the next
illuminator so that's what I like about
it you don't really need to go in and do
a highlight afterwards and just really
it blends everything better than putting
another product on top of your book
debating whether I should do eyeliner or
not right now times are like the look of
just falsies without eyeliner because
you can better see the lashes I think
that's what we're gonna do and I'm
wearing a pretty intense lashes I'm
going to go with the Ardell double ups
in 2:05 personally I don't like to put
on mascara first I like to put on
mascara after the falsies I just feel
like it blends your lashes better into
your false lashes so I just got this
brush on strip lash glue I've never used
this before but it's a brush on Glee
which is really nice because you don't
have to deal with like dragging lashes
in the blue and all that kind of stuff
you just literally brush it on the
lashes whoa it's blue okay
so I applied the falsies and some
mascara to my top lashes what a
difference policy's makes right actually
really like this lash glue
it's a weird blue color which is really
exciting it's like the color of my nails
so then it dries black so you can't see
the glue at all when it dries which is
really nice wait easier to apply than my
normal lash glue I'm going to use my Wet
n Wild mega length on the bottom lashes
like always eyes are complete your lips
are going to be applying the NYX expert
last lipstick this is in the shade four
for seven forever fuchsia never use this
before besides watching it I got this in
like an influencer box or something like
that the only pretty pink today smells
interesting smells like a mix of fruit
and crayons really pretty color so this
is the final look if you guys like
shadow and schmooze get ready with me
videos be sure to give this video a
thumbs up so I know love you guys thanks
for watching see you my next
