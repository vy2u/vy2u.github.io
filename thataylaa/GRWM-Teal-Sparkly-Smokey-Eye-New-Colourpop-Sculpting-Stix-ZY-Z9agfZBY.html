just like to point out that I have on
hands and knees right now looking for
this eyelash found one while you and me
repeat this bit of sweet he is
suffocating and always hesitating
kryptonite desires of my heart of fire
all right so we're starting out with
these brand-new color pop sculpting
sticks these have not one chip I think
they're coming out soon and I already
have my face on because I'm filming a
first impression right now on the
foundation that I'm wearing right here
so friends I'm just highlighting the
high points in my face and then we're
gonna contour a low part you know I'm
saying that's good some cheekbones go in
I'm using a couple different colors to
contour just because I felt like one was
super cool and the other one was too
warm a list all of the products I'm
using and names of everything down below
in the description box and I'm just
using the Beauty Blender to blend all
that stuff out I don't usually use cream
products to contour but I feel like this
gave a really nice natural looking kind
of contour I did want it a little bit
more intense so I go in with some powder
bronzer in a second but I feel like if
you're looking for just a calm
natural-looking contour to your face
these will do it I'm mixing these two
shades from this Too Faced bronzer to
bronze up the face clearly got way too
much it happens you just blend just keep
on blending so that's what we're doing
just go into town blending for a sec
wasn't a fan of that color pop pencil
underneath my eyes so I ended up going
in with some concealer just to brighten
it up a little bit more and add some
coverage so then I'm going to go in with
a Beauty Blender and then set that
concealer with my favorite stargazer
white powder it's like under ten bucks
on Amazon
it is amazing now going in with a Milani
Rose blush and this is super pigmented I
forgot how pigmented these are so I got
a little bit too much but okay I just
went in with a empty powder brush
afterwards to blend and then this
highlight coming up folks
you gotta get this this is by wet and
wild I forgot how intense this was as
well but it was like intense in a good
way
once I ended up blending it I actually
really like this super pretty pearly
pink shade if you have fair skin it's
beautiful you've been in a stage of
dipbrow on the brows to get some shapes
going and then I'm concealing my eyelid
flash priming them with that same
instant age rewind concealer all the
eyeshadows I'm using today are from two
different morphe palette this one right
here is the new 35
and it's a matte palette and every
matching I'm using today is from this
palette I have the coupon code with Mark
II it's a 10% off code I will list it
down below but she's the Tayla I'm going
with this orange shade can we just talk
about how freaking exciting that the
orange shade is once you blend it into
your crease it actually looks so much
more wearable than it does in the pan
and it just gives some nice dimension to
the eye I really like how this part
turned out and now I'm going in with
this other morphe palette and using this
bright a steel matte shade and just
packing that on with a brush you can use
your finger for this - I just wanted it
kind of semi precise so I used a brush
for it and then what we're gonna be
doing is adding some darker brown shade
in the crease / outer V just to give it
a little more definition and then I'm
gonna be going in with a teal glitter I
don't know I was just feeling the
glitter I feel like I haven't done a fun
look in a while so I just want to go in
somewhat what what I just wanted to go
into some glitter today and I ended up
really liking how it turned out oh just
kidding first we're not doing it glitter
we're putting black waterline eyeliner
on our eyes this is by Jolla really nice
things on now we're gonna use the dark
brown shade sitting second if you smudge
out your waterline eyeliner with some
black or brown eyeshadow it makes it
look 50 billion times better and just
more flawless and like airbrush now
we're going in for the start of the show
I like to apply glitter by putting some
blush scored lash adhesive on my
eyeballs and then just packing glitter
on top of it it just helps it really
stick and you can see like I barely got
any fallout which is great especially if
you've already put your foundation on so
I'm just doing the same thing to the
other eye packing on the glitter and I'm
not bringing it all the way out and this
is keeping it like I'll towards the
inner half kind of since we still want
that brown color to show and I'm gonna
take a brush and just dust away any
fallout that we do have only had a few
specks of litter
so that's cool now I'm gonna with some
mascara just put lashes before we put on
false lashes and my favorite false
lashes lately have been the eyelashes
abuser lashes they seriously go with any
look that I do I like it because they
have more lashes towards the outer edge
of the eye and it just makes them look
super nice and fluttery but they're
still super dramatic so just gotta get
those lashes on you know I'm saying do
your thing then I'm gonna go in with
bottom mascara of my favorite Wet n Wild
mega length mascara and then for lips
I'm going to line my lips first with the
colourpop lip liner I love colourpop lip
liners does anyone remember doing this
in like fourth grade with pencils I just
had a throwback there so now I'm lining
my lips and like a nice deep nudie color
I'm not going to fully line my lips here
mostly just the outer part and then I'm
filling in a little bit which you'll see
just to make my lips look bigger then
you will notice how many people have
been getting lip go infinitely it's like
wild so here we go I'm just drawing them
on to make certain parts look a little
bit more fun I'm going with this new
morphe lip product last step I'm going
to clean up the edges of my lip but the
cover effects pencil and then that is it
