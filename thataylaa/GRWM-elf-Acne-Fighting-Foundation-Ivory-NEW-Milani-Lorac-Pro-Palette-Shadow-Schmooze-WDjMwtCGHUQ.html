shadow inch moves get ready with me
video ignore the lines main head of hair
just got another shower so in this video
I'm trying out some new products for you
do to me maybe new to you will see the
makeup I did today is definitely full
coverage so if you want to see this kind
of full coverage routine routing then
you can just keep watching skin was
super clear for like two weeks which is
incredible for me and of course right
before I decide to film this it's that
time of the month and here we go
okay I'm rocking the towel turban and no
pants right now so that's what's
happening okay so I already primed my
face with the Polish toy shine stopper I
have been freaking obsessed with this it
doesn't break on my skin it completely
mattifies it to like a powder finish I'm
just so amazed
so I already primed my face with that I
post on Instagram a picture wearing the
elf acne fighting foundation you guys
wanted to see how I applied it so I'm
going to be mixing it with my Holy Grail
this is amazing Manic Panic
dreamtone foundation have a whole video
on how I use this and how to lighten
your foundation and things like that so
I'm not going to go too in depth the elf
acne fighting foundation is pretty thick
which I actually like and it has pretty
decent coverage how are you guys doing
like I haven't done it like a talked
shadow and schmooze get ready with me in
the longest time I just rub whatever's
left over on my finger on my face and I
go in with my Real Techniques miracle
sponge and I have a comparison video
with this in the forever 21 Beauty
sponge if you want to see that I will
link it over here so you can watch
it is kind of like bounce bounce bounce
this on my face
I just really like the coverage that the
elf acne fighting foundation gives with
the Manic Panic and while we're here
let's just answer a few of your guys's
commonly asked questions about the Manic
Panic
a lot of people asked whether it changes
the consistency of your foundation or
the coverage I guess and I would say
that the Manic Panic alone is about a
medium coverage and it does have a
pretty thick consistency so when you mix
that in with another foundation it's not
really going to affect the coverage of
anything I think it gives it more
coverage just because it does have that
medium coverage as long as I'm rocking
the pale princess I don't think I'll
ever not use this stuff it is amazing I
got off of Amazon the links down below
if you want to try it out
people on Amazon are probably loving it
they're getting a lot of Manic Panic
business right now my last shadow in
schmooze was like 40 minutes that I had
to edit down to like 10 so I'm going to
try and you know speed up this process
okay so now that we've got our
foundation on I'm going to go in with
some concealer for under my eyes and to
highlight some areas I'm using the NYX
HD photogenic concealer in the lightest
shade obviously and I have been
completely completely obsessed with this
it reminds me of Mac's pro longwear like
the consistency of it if you guys have
been watching my videos you know that my
like go-to concealer is usually the
covergirl concealer in a pot that was
discontinued so I've been on the search
for like a new good concealer I
definitely found it I'm obsessed and
this is like five dollars from Ulta so
gotta love it right
so I just like to blend under my eyes
with my finger I don't really like using
the miracle sponge under here because I
feel like it takes away some of the
coverage but that's just me
then for the rest of my face I just like
to go in with the sponge this just gives
you such like an easy flawless finish
and it's so easy to blend in I can't
believe I lived without this thing so
then does that my under eye concealer
you can probably guess what I'm using
because I use it every single day or in
every single video and it's the
Physicians Formula correcting powder in
translucent it is freaking amazing if
you have very fair skin or you just like
a super light under eye area definitely
give this stuff a try because it is by
far the lightest drugstore powder that I
have found the other day I was in writed
and this girl and her dad were in there
and she had super fair skin and like
freckles and it minded me of like
mini-me when I was in seventh grade and
that she's like talking to her dad about
how none of the foundations are light
enough for her skin and I was like girl
let me tell you so I gave her some
suggestions and she was very happy and
is really cute cool story bro which I
told again so I just use this on all the
areas of my face that I want highlighted
another Physicians Formula powder and
this is just the mineral foundation
powder
as you guys probably know I have super
acne prone skin literally 9 out of 10
drugstore foundations will break me out
in Physicians Formula is one of those
brands that my skin loves that in
Maybelline Rimmel stay matte powder
breaks me out like Noah where is my
eyebrow brush let's just use this did
you guys just hear my throat that was
intense
and then I'm going to go ahead and set
it with my Urban Decay all nighter spray
the background looks so dark right now
it is 3:00 in the afternoon on a Friday
and I'm just now getting ready welcome
to senior year okay so while I'm waiting
for that to set in before I put on my
blush and things I'm going to go ahead
and do my brows I have a whole brow
routine which I will link over here and
it'll open a new window I use Mac's past
Twilight fluid line and I will be right
back so the bras are on look like a bald
man right now zoom do you guys in a
little bit so you can see the whole eye
process we're going to do so Milani was
super freaking cool and sent me a bunch
of stuff to try out so I'm going to do
that in this video so they send me the
brow and I highlighter so I'm going to
use the lighter side there's a matte
side and a luminous luminous lift side
so that's kind of cool I'm going to go
ahead and use the matte side for under
my brow
I'm going to go in with a concealer
brush and just blend that out I like
can't talk when I do my eyebrows takes
way too much concentration okay so that
blended out super easily I also have the
Sigma brow highlight and that one is
like way too difficult to blend out in
my opinion but this one was good next
I'm gonna use my hard candy I primer
where is it I got this a couple weeks
ago and I have been loving it a little
bit of color to it it kinda reminds me
exactly of the Urban Decay primer potion
hard candy used to be owned by Urban
Decay so that makes sense I don't even
know what we're doing on the eyes today
I'm going to get sushi happy hour in
like two hours so I don't want to go
like too insane that's the problem with
filming like we have real lives and I
don't really want to be walking around
with like a dramatic smoky eye to go get
sushi at 5 p.m. the youtubes struggle
I'm going to go in with some blush warm
up the face debating using my new tube a
sweetheart blush they got from Ulta for
the $15 sale look at it it is so
freaking beautiful want to do a red lip
so I kind of want like a matte cheek you
know okay Taylor what are we doing not
that hard to figure out what to go since
I'm going to do a red lip I think I'm
going to go in with my next blush in
peach wrong way
I feel like any blush I use now and seem
pigmented at all to me because I use my
wet and wild pearlescent plink pink bra
just give up the pearlescent pink blush
every single day and that one is like
crazy pigmented okay I give up on this
blush going back to my pearlescent pink
sorry guys I tried to Brandt you out
using my morphe blush brush that I use
with this every single day like look at
that so much better we've had super
weird
spring weather lately it's been like
eighty one day and then 50 and raining
and freezing another day what's the
weather like by you guys right now right
got my blush on now I'm going in with my
mary-lou manizer highlighter balm which
i got off of hot look I'm just applying
this on my cheekbone and then under my
brow bone a little bit
all right let's do eyes shall we have no
idea what I'm feeling for the eyes so
let's just see what happens I think I'm
gonna use the lorac Pro palette which I
adopted from my best friend's sister
shout out to Nadine if you're watching
go in with mauve in my crease this is
great if you have green eyes make them
pop
maybe we'll just do the look that was in
my sponge Smackdown video you guys were
asking for a tutorial on the look I was
wearing in that so maybe I'll just do
that I look today hit two birds with one
stone top the sing
I am very staying challenged why would
anyone want to hit a bird of the stone
in the first place that sounds like a
horrible way to spend your time so I'm
going to use cream with my finger just
going to put this all over the lid
the eyeshadows are so velvety it is
insane
and I'm going to go in with white and
put this on my inner corner
then just blend it into that cream color
a little bit
what am i doing we're going to deepen up
the crease a little bit I think I used
expresso that day so I'm going to do
that and just put this like literally
create kind of a cut crease look super
lightly and then we're going to blend it
out with a different brush
so I'm just putting this right where I
would want my crease to be ideally this
makes you look like you have the lid and
then I'm going to go in with my Sigma
e-40
I basically just go in circular motions
windshield wiper a little bit you know I
mean then I'm taking this angled brush
there we go from more first color that
we started with on my bottom lash line
for eyeliner I'm going to try out the
Milani eye tech extreme liquid eyeliner
I feel like I've heard good stuff about
this one I don't know my Physicians
Formula
eye booster is pretty hard to beat
though we'll see this one is definitely
super black has a really fine point at
the end so it's easy to get into that
inner corner it is a felt tip applicator
so it feels a little bit different than
the Physicians Formula decisions formula
is like more of a brush
okay that was super easy to create my
wing over here hells yeah so that was
super easy to make the wing that
literally took me about 20 seconds
combined which rarely happens for
mascara I'm going in with my usual Mac
prep and prime eyelash primer L'Oreal
carbon black in the wet wild make a
length mascara for my bottom lashes so
I'll be right back and I go in with the
Jordana eyeliner in 38 dark brown and
I've been liking this just for making
the bottom lash line a little bit more
intense it's not like a Kohl liner so
it's not going to give you too much
color I just got this out Walgreens and
things like two dollars that's it for
eyes and I'm going to use this Milani
anti feathering lip liner which is a
super cool concept to me so it looks
like you're supposed to put this
everywhere prime lips by filling in to
extend the wear of any lipstick or lip
gloss it's literally just like a clear
lip liner hmm smells interesting
feels much more like waxy than I
expected which I guess is a points and
your lipstick isn't going to slide
around your lips today I'm going to do
red
milania's best ride is by far my new
favorite red lipstick as far as the
color goes I'm obsessed and it smells
like oh my god in heaven Jolly Rancher
but still kind of lipstick ewwww
well I definitely notice a difference
applying it with that primer and then by
itself usually it like glides right on
this is like it's like sticking to the
primer which good makes sense it
definitely feels tacky glued on my lips
I just love this red it's a little bit
blue based so it makes your teeth look a
little whiter and take down the hair and
then wrap this up alright so this is the
final look if you guys like these type
of shadow and schmooze get ready with me

know I do have the swatches of these
Milani lipsticks on my blog so if you
