easy gel nail tutorial without using a
UV light what you're going to need is
the cause mark quick nails brush on gel
kit you can get this from CVS or
rite-aid for around ten dollars in the
kit can be used for at least five
different applications the kit comes
with pre-cut tips but I like to get mine
from ebay today I'm using these sparkly
grade toasts but you can use white tips
if you want to French manicure or any
other color you want the first thing you
want to do is match the tips to your
nails finding the right size you want to
make sure they aren't too big or else
they will pop off easier once you have
everything laid out you're going to use
a file to roughen up your nails so the
nail glue really adheres to your nail
I'm using a hundred 180 grit file from
Sally Beauty make sure you get the whole
nail especially the size
next you're going to take nail glue I'm
using byb nail glue from ebay but
there's also glue that comes in the kit
that you can use and I'm having issues
opening the clip when applying glue to
the tip you want to put it on about the
bottom fifth of the nail and make sure
to hold the tip in a way that you'll be
able to easily place it on your nail
once your glue is on the tip you're
going to place the tip firmly on your
nail for about 20 to 30 seconds make
sure to apply steady pressure and to
keep the tip in the same place if the
tip slides off in the first five seconds
of applying don't worry life will move
on it's because you moved just use some
nail polish remover to remove the glue
from your nail and try again
once your tips are looking really long
and creepy like this you're going to use
acrylic Clippers like these to trim them
once again I got these from eBay and all
the links will be in the downbar to clip
the tips the arc of the Clippers should
be facedown and clip it longer than you
want because you'll be filing them down
to shape them
you
next you're going to take the 180 grit
side of the nail file to shape your nail
I like mine square so I'm mainly just
making sure the edges are smooth and
shortening them a little bit
once you've shaved your nails you're
going to use a nail dehydrator to move
any oil from your nail bed to help the
gel stay and last longer when we apply
this to your natural nail not to the
tips
now for the important part on the cause
of our box they have really good
directions but basically you're going to
line up the three bottles first is the
gel second is the gel cleaner and third
is the gel activator this is important
because you need to move kind of quickly
while the gel is still wet you'll notice
that the last bottle doesn't have a
brush this is because every time you
apply the gel activator the brush goes
right back into the cleaner or middle
bottle or else the gel will harden on
the brush and you won't be able to use
it if you're confused don't worry it's
super easy and I'll show you how to do
it starting with the gel make sure you
apply really even strokes covering the
whole nail right after that on the same
nail take the brush from the middle
bottle dip it in the gel activator and
apply to your nail you just want to
apply these like you would with a normal
nail polish but make sure that you're
applying the same amount of gel as you
are gel activator or else it will get
too sticky and not dry if that happens
repeat the steps but make sure you put
an even amount of both products on so it
hardens you're going to apply two coats
so once your nails are dry going again
and do the same thing at this point if
you have any rough edges go in with a
buffer block like this to smooth them
out today I don't have any so I'm
skipping that step the last thing you
want to do is apply a topcoat my
favourite is safe feet and I applied two
coats so my nails are extra shiny this
is a super easy alternative to paying
$35 at the salon so I hope you guys try
it out if you like this video tutorial
