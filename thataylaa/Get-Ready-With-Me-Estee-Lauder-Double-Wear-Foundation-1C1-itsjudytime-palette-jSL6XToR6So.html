know what I went through to film this
video today all my stuff is on the desk
that is completely taped up right now if
you follow my Twitter you saw all the
packing mayhem that's going on this will
all be cleared out also my one bra that
I left out before filming this when mi a
so I'm currently wearing a swimsuit top
so today we have a shadow and schmooze
get ready with me video on the look I'm
wearing right now use some stuff that's
new to me did kind of a first impression
on the Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation which I got for my birthday I
don't know if I would ever have the
balls to purchase this on my own it is a
pretty pricey foundations my first like
super high-end foundation it even has a
glass bottle feel like I need like a
case for it right now I also tried out
some new products that I got when I was
back in Southern California this eye
look is really similar to the eye look I
wore in my Rimmel stay matte cream
blushes review that you guys wanted to
see a tutorial on the only difference is
that I put black eyeliner on my
waterline in that video so if you like
that look then here it is for you today
so I already washed and priming my face
with the benefit oh crap benefit
Porefessional but then I fell asleep on
the couch so now I'm priming again I
love this smell of this so today I'm
going to be using the Estee Lauder
Double Wear foundation for the very
first time I have the shade 1 c1 cool
bone I think there's a 1w one I don't
know there's a lot of fair shades and I
basically just Google imaged each one to
see swatches super excited about this
foundation this is my first like true
high-end foundation it has a glass
bottle that's when you know shit's real
and how beautiful it is freaking heavy
so it has 1 fluid ounce in here pretty
standard for a foundation I'm going to
be using my more foundation brush to
apply this just because I'm moving and
it's the only one that I left out with
me and it's my only clean brush at the
moment this is supposed to be super full
coverage which I'm all about I'm just
going to put a little bit on the back of
my hand to start start by stippling it
in here and then blending it into my
face
also my lip ring fell out today awesome
this is like the third time it's fallen
out don't really know what's going on
okay so that was one same layer of the
foundation it covered pretty much all of
my cystic acne down here it's making my
pores look a little big right now I feel
like I'm pouring gold out on my hand
right now so here is one layer has a
pretty nice satin finish so far it looks
exactly like my maybelline superstay
foundation I think the color is a pretty
good match it might be a little bit too
dark but I can lighten it up with a
little concealer so I'm just going to
use like half that amount and do the
rest of my face again died my roots last
night you can definitely see some
splotches going on so this is after the
second layer covered pretty much
everything it looks really nice on my
skin no complaints other than my pores
look a little bit bigger than usual so
I'm going to use my L'Oreal magic Lumi
concealer which I haven't used in a
while because it was under my bed this
whole time I can't remember if I have to
lighten this one I think I do yeah looks
pretty dark I'm going to put a little
bit on the back of my hand and then mix
in my NYX lavender concealer to lighten
it up I think I just got way too much it
feels really difficult to blend out
under my eye I don't know if that's the
concealer or the foundation setting I
think it's just the foundation setting
of course the sun's trying to come out
right now definitely looks like I have a
good amount of foundation on right now
it doesn't look natural at all first of
five minutes it's been sunny all day is
right when I'm filming I think this
lighting is a little better so then I'm
going to set my under eye like always
with my Physicians Formula correcting
powder and translucent this is a brand
new one always feels so good when you do
the first swirl you know really right
now okay of course it's like peeking
through the one branch on the tree right
here alright so I'm going to set the
rest of my face with my Laura Geller
balance and Brighton powder and this is
in porcelain love this stuff mention
this in my June raves and rejects if you
didn't see that video you can watch it
over here just click that link
definitely feels like the foundation is
completely set I don't even know if I
needed a powder I think next time I wear
I won't apply powder because it looks a
little bit much right now I think gotta
comb through the brows I'm literally
only using stuff that I have in my
travel makeup bag right now because all
my makeup is packed actually
embarrassing how much makeup I have I
had to get a jumbo cardboard box for
solely my makeup so thank for blush /
bronzer I'm using the bare minerals
ready color boost and this is the
endless celebration I got this from a
CCO for like super cheap but you can get
this off of QVC haven't ever used it
before if you follow me on instagram you
saw me post picture of this so I'm just
going to swirl everything for the blush
and then I'm just going to get a smaller
brush and go in with this shade for the
contour I really like this shade it
looks like a cool toned pink which I
don't have very many of I actually
really like this also kind of does the
highlighting for you because the way
that is placed in the palette if you're
swirling your brush like this the top of
the brush right there is going to give
you the highlight ooh like in the blush
the only brush I have I do not leave out
a contour brush so I'm just going to use
this brush from eBay I think and I'm
just going to hold it like this and
flatten it out a little bit to give me a
contour so I'm just taking the shade
down here I'm going to do my brows
really quick eye the whole eyebrow
routine so if you want to see that a
link below how crazy is that difference
alright got our brows on for eye primer
I'm using Urban Decay's primer potion
this is the mini version this brought
this traveling because why not I really
don't think it's not amazing Urban Decay
eye products usually make my eyes go
really red and watery but this stuff
doesn't so that's good no idea what
we're doing for eyes the only two
palettes I have out right now are the
it's Judy's time palette and the
revealed 2 palette of course I'm
obsessed with this mention this in my
June at raves and rejects video as well
oh I totally forgot to use this thing
let's use it this is the bare minerals
clear radiance those called clear
radiance I got this at the CCO they were
having like a 3 for $18 thing so I got
this
and then my mom about one of these okay
how do you open these that worked it
looks like a light pearlescent pink so I
think we're just going to add this to
the blush beyond it I'm also going to
add this down the bridge of my nose and
Kabuto
so I'm 99% sure that my one blending
brush is taped shut back there in that
nightstand so I'm going to be using
these four brushes all of them will be
linked down below if you're interested
if not that's great too
I think I'm going to start with the itch
Judy's time collet and use this light
tan shape need more Rockstar like how
that was urgent enough to just do like
mid blending so then I think I'm going
to take actually you do I want to hit
yeah let's do it why not I think I'm
going to take this blueish purple shade
periwinkle yeah we have a word for that
that's a lot more blue than I remembered
I swear with not this blue less time
used it so I'm going to take my favorite
warm brown shade from the revealed 2
palette which I've been using pretty
much everyday I'm just going to pop this
in the outer third of my eye and then
blend it inward a little bit it looks
kind of purple when you blend it with
the blue feel like I'm just so stressed
right now that I'm just thinking in my
head instead of remembering to talk to
the camera so I'm going to go back in
with with that first brush that we used
and blend everything together I'm going
to run whatever was on the brush left on
the bottom lashline just the outer third
I think for the inner corner I'm just
going to use that light highlight shade
from the bare minerals quad I'm just
gonna put that on my finger and then put
that on the inner corner I just want a
super subtle highlight and I'm just
going to use my Physicians Formula
eye booster eyeliner for a small wing or
a big wing I don't know
see what happens I just got a brand new
one of these and it is so much black
better than my old one I think I used my
old one for like a month longer than I
should've
it's literally my favorite drugstore
liquid liner if you haven't tried it
already you need it in your life for
mascaras I'm going to start out with my
Mac prep and prime use it everytime love
it then I'm going to use my miss manga
luminous mascara I did kind of a first
impression on this in my lash out orange
mousse video which I will link over here
so if you want to see that then you can
click that video I'm just going to fast
forward through my mascaras and then
I'll be back I wanted to zoom you guys
in for a close-up on the eyes and I also
want to point out that it is already
starting to crease in my forehead line
just from doing my mascara or something
like that because that's what I do
comment down below if you use the Double
Wear foundation and what your favorite
powder is for it because I feel like it
looked way better before I put a powder
on top of it so I don't know it might
just be one of those foundations that
you don't need a powder I think we're
just going to go with new lips I'm just
going to take my foundation brush if I
can find it there it is and cancel out
some of the pigment on my lips I'm using
eights naked truth this is my favorite
nude color perfect nude isn't drying
I really wish I could put on falsies
right now but I packed all of them away
so we're just going with the natural
lashes and the Sun is coming back out
again so this is the final look if you
