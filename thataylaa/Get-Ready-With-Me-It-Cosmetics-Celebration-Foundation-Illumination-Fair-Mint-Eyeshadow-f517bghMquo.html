video on the look I'm wearing right now
just tried to film this intro three
times every single time it was blurry
fourth times a charm or it better be I
throw the camera out the window so for
today shadowing schmooze video I decided
to do my everyday foundation routine
what I've been doing lately then also
decided to do kind of a mint eye with
the essence blew me up a shadow which I
just picked up from Fred Meyer so if you
want to see how I did this look and you
just want to chat about the world and
what's going on in it and just keep
watching
all right so I think I finally figured
out a good spot to film with the
lighting and everything I hope I'm in
focus right now if you watch my update
video video update video I filmed an
entire get ready with me video in this
location that was completely blurry and
horrible so I don't even know if I'm
putting it up so today is going to be
another shadow intro you guys seem to
love these and I love filming them fun
for me and they're fun for you so
win-win
yeah the background is frickin loud now
that I'm like living in an actual city
sorry can't do much about it anyways I
posted on Twitter what you guys wanted
to see me use in today's video I think
the one I'm going to go with is my
current everyday foundation routine just
because it's all conveniently placed in
this bag because this is what I've been
getting ready for work with so I am
going to be trying out this new face
primer I just got in the mail yesterday
it's the Korres Korres face primer it
says silicone free and it's kind of
difficult to find silicone free primers
this one is 99% natural I wonder what
that 1% is it got really good reviews on
Tim Talia so let's see I'm just putting
a little bit on my finger smells like
Orange Julius yeah smells super citrusy
and it feels like a moisturizer if
you've tried the L'Oreal Lumi primer it
kind of feels like that but it feels
even more moisturized look at this huge
a Seattle mug I got literally as big as
my face alright so I've already dampened
my just flesh called a Beauty Blender my
miracle complexion sponge this is just
what I've been using every morning I had
a brush phase again and now I think I'm
back to the sponge to the foundation
that I've been using every single day
for work is the Revlon Colorstay
foundation in 110 ivory I feel like I
don't know how much more I can say about
this foundation because I mentioned it
times in different videos it's just
simple like I don't have to mix anything
into it I don't have to do anything to
it it's just already like easy to use
and ready to go so I just like to bounce
this on my face and I focus my only most
focus mostly on my acne areas which are
down here obviously so what's new in the
world if you saw my update video you
know that I'm subletting this apartment
right now we basically are renting it
looks fully furnished go to make
hard-boiled eggs this morning and there
is no pot who doesn't own a pot so I
ended up making hard-boiled eggs in a
teapot whatever is left over on my hand
I just like to go over those same acne
spots concealers I've been using are the
same the rebel and age-defying and then
mixing in a little bit of mixed lavender
concealer just to lighten that up I
don't know if it's the primer under here
but this is feeling like it blends out a
lot easier than it usually does I
decided to buy argan oil and I was
looking at the Josie Maran stuff and I
was like there's no frickin way in hell
and spending $50 on a tiny-ass bottle of
oil so I looked at the ingredients and I
found one similar on Amazon for $20 used
argan oil on my face for the first time
last night putting oil on your face
feels so wrong to me but I'm really
trying to trying to get used to it argan
oil is supposed to be really good for
acne and acne scarring and things like
that so giving it a try alright once we
got our liquids on liquids to set the
under-eye concealer I use my Holy Grail
Physicians Formula translucent light
setting powder so then the next product
I've been using is the cosmetics
celebration foundation illumination fair
which I talked all about in that get
ready with me video so if I don't end up
posting that video I might do a full
review on this stuff basically this is
such an incredible powder gives you
amazing coverage does not look like
you're wearing a powder at all since it
is a little bit illuminating a lot of
it's not a little bit yeah hell
elimination on days like on the weekend
or something I have
and just wearing this stuff with
concealer and I posted a picture on
Instagram of that it looks like you're
wearing full coverage foundation but if
I still want to put on my Revlon
Colorstay I just dust a little bit of
this stuff over to set everything and it
just gives you such a pretty glow and I
am kind of obsessed with it and also the
fair shade is actually fair enough
I didn't think it was gonna be light
enough what it is I don't like using the
brush that it comes with to apply it
because I don't like the way it places
the product on your face but I do really
like the brush for use for blush I got
this foundation off of QVC and it came
with the brush show not too sad about it
I know if you guys can tell on camera
but it just gives you such a pretty glow
so I haven't been really reaching for
bronzer lately I don't know why just
haven't been reaching for lately so the
blush I've been using is the bare
minerals why did I show it like that
whoa that looks really dirty the bare
minerals ready color boost and this is
in the shade endless celebration it is
so beautiful gives you a super pretty
like cool pink kind of blow this is the
it cosmetics brush I was talking about I
think I am going to upload that video
just because I talk so in-depth about
these products and I don't know let me
know what you guys think like to dust a
little bit of this on my nose just
whatever is left over just so it doesn't
look so one-dimensional my face after
everything I do go in and spray it with
my Urban Decay all nighter setting spray
obviously whoa where did you come from
here so I'm going to do my brows and
then I will be right back alright so for
eyes I'm just zooming you guys in here
maybe I should have put the in
front of me alright so I think I'm going
to do kind of a mint green I never done
one of those before and I found this
essence blew me up eyeshadow in the
shade below my mint and we start by
priming my eyes with hard candies
eyeshadow primer and I just put over
this all over but by the time you guys
are watching this video my Seattle
update will have already been up so I
just filmed that yesterday in my time
so I feel like I just told you guys
everything that's going on right now in
life I think today I'm going to go to
Ikea and explore because I'm about to
furnish a new apartment I basically
didn't do a whole like black-and-white
room thing I think we want to see the
things I'm going for then you can follow
that Pinterest board so my Sigma e-40
brush is still m.i.a so I'm just taking
this what is the 6 plus brushes from
eBay I'm going to go in with the naked 2
palette and I'm taking T's which is this
matte taupe color right here and I'm
just plopping that in the crease what
was I saying
IKEA IKEA is like top 5 greatest places
in this country and my writer am i right
alright so once we got that color on I'm
going to go in with the mint green color
from essence and I'm just going to take
my finger never use this before I've
never swatched it so we'll see
looks pretty pigmented whoo-hoo that's
really pretty
hell yeah I'm really all about applying
the lid color with your finger I just
think it gives it the best pigmentation
overall still haven't unpacked my makeup
bag the way this room is laid out when I
get ready for work in the morning I have
to do my makeup in the kitchen because
there's literally no light all right so
I'm going to go in with busted so when I
do this color I like to bring it about
1/3 of the way in and then just blend it
together with the same brush so I like
to start by packing it on and then I
like to just blend it in words
do I need to pluck my eyebrows I do
so I'm going to go back into the
blending brush or whichever one I'm
using just do some circular motions here
then I'm going to add a little bit of
black out just because I can I'm just
putting this right on the outside of
that brown color we just placed and then
slightly blending it into the crease see
how it just gives your eye a little bit
more definition and then I'm going to
take one of my favorite eyeshadows from
urban decay which is verb and it is this
like super cool tone silver color and
I'm just going to plop that on the inner
corner
I'm going to take T's on this brush and
just run it along the bottom lash line
for liner I'm using my trusty Physicians
Formula I booster pen
so I think we are actually going to do
lashes for the first time in a while
these are good lashes when you want to
put on lashes but you don't want it to
be like too much you know I'm saying and
my favourite lash go lately has been the
duo lash adhesive but this is the brush
on kind it is so much easier and you can
actually see what you're doing so I'm
going to pop these guys on and I'll be
right back
got my lashes on change the shirt it was
a productive last five minutes
so for lips I'm actually going to be
using a lip gloss which isn't usually my
thing I just can't do the stickiness of
it I've been completely obsessed with
the whitening lightening lip gloss in
sugar mama the color formula everything
is just amazing super pigmented and look
at this light like what the I do
have a 25% off code for whitening
lightening off your whole order if you
want to try us out look at that how
crazy pigmented is that and this
last so this is the final look if you
