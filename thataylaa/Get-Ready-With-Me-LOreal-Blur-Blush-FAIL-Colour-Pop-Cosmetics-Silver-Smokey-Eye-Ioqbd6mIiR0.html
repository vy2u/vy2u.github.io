schmooze on the look I'm wearing right
now use some BB cream that I haven't
used in a while
colour-pop cosmetics try these out a lot
of people have been asking on instagram
for a smokey eye for people with fair
skin this is what I would do for a
smokey eye I think it's super wearable
you can wear with any lip color the
pin-up look is coming I promise
probably be the next shadow mousse I
know I said that last time but I think
it's really happening next time got my
Vegas mug ready to rumble all right
let's do this
got my brand new mermaid hair extensions
in kind of excited right now
so I think I'm going to be using the BB
cream by Garnier the oily skin one and
mixing that with Manic Panic dreamtone
to lighten it up a couple people have
been asking me if you can mix Manic
Panic with BB cream I do this combo
works well for me I've only tried one or
two foundations that this doesn't mix
well with for the most part like 90% of
foundations are totally fine OCO
darkness is like that is the lightest
shade so I have to mix a couple pumps
probably two and a half and with that if
I just went outside like this alright
I'm going to use my Real Techniques
sponge and go ahead and apply this I
haven't been really liking full coverage
foundations lately at all I don't know
why I've been using the Maybelline Dream
wonder foundation every day and that's
like a medium coverage but it feels like
you're literally wearing nothing so
whenever I put actual stuff on my face
now it feels kind of weird it actually
sits really well I forgot how much I
like this stuff welcome to Seattle in
the summer alright so for concealer is
going to be using the usual Revlon
age-defying with NYX lavender concealer
I mix these two together to lighten this
one up and it's just the perfect combo
almost out of this guy it is
ridiculously hot right now like always
going to set the under eye with
Physicians Formula trance
Lucent powder with my ELF powder brush
that make no sense you know what I mean
all right so for bronzer I'm going to
use this Maybelline master glaze bronzer
stick this is in the shade subtle bronze
210 I think this might have been limited
edition I got this a while ago and I've
been meaning to use it in a video and I
just haven't gotten around to it but
this is a really good bronzer for fair
skin as you can see it's super subtle
like a name says does have a little bit
of shimmer truck I'm just going to
contour it up with this a little bit and
I only like to put on my cheekbones I
don't know I feel like when I put it on
the rest of my face is just not my thing
so I'm just using a stippling brush to
blend this out and it is super easy to
blend out when I work with cream
products I don't like to powder my face
at all if you're going to powder your
face you want to do it afterwards while
we're working with the cream stuff I'm
going to go in with L'Oreal visible lift
blur this was originally 1199 and I
found it at Target for 358 freaking
score this is in the shade 503 soft
berry I've never tried this before after
I just supposed to be good there's a
little seal on here I'm going to put a
little bit on the back of my hand I
watched a couple videos and they look
pretty pigmented it looks kind of like a
melted crayon I'm just going to use that
same stippling brush and go ahead and
see how this works okay it's coming out
really weird and chunky this one like
defected I'm going to try and fly it
with my finger awesome this is really
great I'm going with the foundation
brush and try and blend this out a
little bit alright this is kind of an
epic fail because it removed on my
foundation right here and then where I
set my under eye concealer with the
powder is still on so this is
interesting I'm going to go back in with
my powder and see if I can salvage this
face that definitely helped a little bit
to blend everything together I'm just
going to go
with a normal powder blush because I
can't do this I'm gonna be using
Tarte blush and doll face to suggest a
powder blush that I use pretty much
every day and I don't know how this
hasn't hit pan yet it's a freaking
miracle I've literally been using this
everyday for the past couple months I
was using the cosmetics celebration
foundation illumination brush I'm going
to go back in with my Real Techniques
sponge it's still damp and I'm just
going to kind of blend everything
together with this just because I feel
like it's looking a little funky with
all this cream stuff going on okay I'm
going to do the brows because my
battery's about to die and I will be
right back we have got our brows on I'm
going to prime my eyes I still really
want to use this freaking BH Cosmetics
Studio Pro primer and it still isn't
coming out if you saw my last shout inch
mousse
this is like just not happening not
happening oh it's shocked right now like
I should go buy a lottery ticket so this
is their new eye primer I obviously got
way too much so I'm just going to dab a
little bit on my eyeball it feels really
similar to the Urban Decay primer potion
this is supposed to be waterproof
interesting since you need to go
swimming with eyeshadow on so it
definitely feels a little more tacky
when it dries which I really like
because then I feel like the eyeshadow
is going to adhere better alright so for
eyes I'm kind of feeling like a silvery
taupe II I don't know we'll see what
happens but I have this new colour-pop
cosmetics eyeshadow and this is in the
shade who really knows I actually don't
know Liberty and it's like a silvery
magical thing whenever I'm doing a
silver kind of eye I like to use the
Naked 2 palette just because I feel like
these are really nice cool toned
eyeshadows and I just worked well with
silver shades I'm not a huge fan
the naked palettes I think they actually
might irritate my eyes a little bit but
what we do for makeup you know so I'm
just taking T's with a sigma e-40
blending brush and putting this all over
the crease I feel like that just blended
out super easily with the primary
alright so I'm also going to run T's on
the bottom lash line and just blend
there's no way to plug in this fan and
have it actually reach my face in this
room so just take it some fan breaks I
usually like to do my lip color first by
thing I'm going to try a new way today
I'm going to do black out and we're
going to go ahead and apply our outer V
color first so I'm just applying this to
the outer third and then blending it
inwards a little bit we kind of want the
darkest parts to be on the inside and
the outer V for this loop might as well
answer some of your guys Instagram
questions while we're shadowing and
schmoozing I'm getting a lot of
questions asking if I'm still working at
Mac drink freely on Mac if you weren't
aware that and now that I have a full
time job
and YouTube I literally have no time I'd
love to go back to doing freelance at
Mac the time is just not now
so I'm just going to flip my brush
sideways and then we are going to blend
upwards a little bit alright ready for
the silver so I have not tried the
colour-pop cosmetics eyeshadows I've
heard amazing things about them i've
swatched a few and they look frickin
amazeballs they feel almost like the
Maybelline bouncy blush they have an
interesting texture I don't know how you
would ever go through an entire one of
these eyeshadows because literally need
like one dab they retail for $5 which is
incredible so I'm just going to go ahead
and apply this to the center of my eye
with my finger look at how insane that
is what is this literally though I kinda
want to know how they did this that is
insane this looks like what you usually
get when you wet a pigment no words so
I'm just going to go back in with that
brush that we use blackout on and I'm
not going to apply any more product but
whatever is left over on the brush I'm
just going to
blend that out our third again this is
so insane so I'm going to take a tiny
bit of black out on the outer third of
bottom lash line and blend away how many
times do you think we say blend in a
video I'm going to go back in with T's
and blend so for eyeliner I'm going to
apply my la girl glide on gel liner in
black it's one of my favorite eye liners
for the waterline
it is amazing it's two dollars or less
than that movie dollar super black super
good you should get it for talk my liner
I'm not really feeling the wing today so
for the top lash line we're going to use
a gel liner I rarely use a gel liner I
usually use it when I don't want to wing
for some reason I just don't like making
a wing with gel liner I don't know it's
a little too much patience I'll be using
this brush by 6 plus this is from ebay
and then morphe brushes gel eyeliner in
black and we're gonna creep I don't know
what we'll see alright that took forever
and a half but we are back debating
whether I want to use falsies or not
right now I think we need them for
falsies I'm going to use the kiss me 0-3
lashes these are from eBay and I love
them they're good if you want like the
dull looking kind of lashes you know I
mean I'm using my favorite brush on lash
glue this is by duo the link is down
below I got it off of a Kate house and
it's also where I got my la girl light
on eyeliner so I'm going to apply these
and I'll be right back policies are on I
feel like these lashes are just a good
amount of drama you know I mean you can
still see the shadow but they give it a
little also applied L'Oreal carbon black
to blend in my natural lashes with the
falsies and I applied some Wet n Wild
mega length to bottom lashes before I
highlight I'm going to use Physicians
Formula shimmer brick strips things and
nude and I'm just going to apply this to
the top of the cheekbones so if we're
lips I'm kind of feeling like a super
pink Nicki Minaj kind of lip so I think
this eyelid could literally be paired
with any kind of lip color that you
wanted personally I would you
a pink or a nude I'm going to be using a
lip liner by NYX this is in pretty and
pink so you're attractable waterproof
lip liner these are super reasonable and
legit legit and it just broke okay I
think my room is so hot right now that
it's literally melting these bra toes
yeah it's like hot so for lipstick I'm
going to apply the NYX macaron lipstick
and this is in the shade rose and it is
this neon a pinkish shade it's a lot
lighter than I thought
all right to blend that and go back in
with that pink liner just kind of shade
it on the outer corners all right so
this is the final look
comment down below what color you guys
would pair this eye look with I think
you could literally be worn with
anything kind of feeling the neon lip
