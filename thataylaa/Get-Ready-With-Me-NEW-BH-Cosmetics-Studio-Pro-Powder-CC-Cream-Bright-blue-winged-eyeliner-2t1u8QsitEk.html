video on the look I'm wearing right now
got some bright blue unexpected eyeliner
going on unexpected in the sense that I
thought I was doing a neutral top all
right then we ended up with electric
blue eyeliner I did two lip options the
first was a more natural lip in the
second is clearly a black lip whatever
you're feeling I personally like the
black lip I use some new foundation
products as a CC cream from the Mimi box
unboxing video the new BH Cosmetics
Studio Pro powder so if you want to hear
my thoughts on those and see how they
apply you're in the right place should
probably address the fact that the
background is different wallpapered this
bad boy yesterday is a lot harder
than you think let me know what you guys
think of the background also wanted to
say a huge thank you to you guys because
I hit 40,000 subscribers which is insane
to me
you guys are amazed Belles and thanks so
we're gonna start like I'm whispering
right now what am i doing alright so I
have some actually have a bunch of
products I've never tried out before the
minis in this video first one is this
CC cream this is by new Ganic just from
the Mimi box by the way when I tested
this on my hand it kind of looked like
it was skin tone adjusting it was white
when I first put it on so this is gonna
be interesting I already primed my face
which I guess I didn't have to because
I'm using a CC cream but whatever feel
like I need some chapstick alright so
I'm just gonna pump this on the back of
my hand and then apply it with the Sigma
f80 2 kabuki brush it's literally white
when you put on the back of your hand
and it has some weird like black grainy
things in it
I don't know so I guess we'll see how
this adjust oh yeah see it totally
adjust to your skin that's crazy it
feels very very thick holy crap I'm
really hoping this doesn't break me out
because girl doesn't need any more
breakouts actually trying a new acne
medication so I will keep you guys
I'm going to try it out for about a
couple months and see if it works
alright so that was just with one I
don't know what you want to call it dab
they covered pretty well definitely is a
little bit luminous this whole skin tone
adjusting thing is crazy to me like the
fact that someone was actually sitting
somewhere developing something than just
your skin tone you know anyone else
amused by this probably not this would
probably apply better with a real
techniques sponge or Beauty Blender
think I need a quick look at stylish oh
I don't have an exciting coffee cup for
you guys this time I know you're
heartbroken alright so I'm gonna leave
it just as it is because we are gonna be
using a full coverage powder I'm just
gonna go ahead and apply my concealer
like usual is nice because I'm finally
in my new room so I have all my
right in front of me I don't have to go
digging for stuff so I'm using Revlon
age-defying concealer with NYX lavender
concealer I just finished this you guys
will be singing in an upcoming empties
video had to make an emergency old to
run yesterday so what's going on in life
I can't believe I've been in Seattle two
months now it's absolutely insane to me
I feel like I haven't done nearly enough
stuff yeah it's like I don't actually
have a weekend because on the weekends
all I do is edit YouTube do YouTube work
and unpack like this weekend I built a
frickin bed and wallpapered this wall
sometimes got to do it you know a lot of
your fare was amazing I met a few of you
guys and it was so cool it makes me want
to go to more like YouTube events
Physicians Formula powder and
translucent to set the under eyes if
you're looking for a good cheap powder
brush get this thing this is the ELF
powder brush it's like three bucks from
Target or you can get it online I use
this for under my eyes and for all over
my face this bugging me
TC cream still feels super tacky coffee
break I need to paint the nails badly
but there's just no time plucked my
eyebrows right before this video because
I was like I look
Chewbacca right now I wanted to use the
new L'Oreal visible lips blur blush
thing which is a gel blush but if I'm
going to be using this powder then we
can't do that let me use this in a
different shadow intra mousse so stay
tuned for that all right so this is the
new BH Cosmetics Studio Pro pressed
powder it's supposed to be full coverage
people are saying it's like Mac Studio
Fix the packaging is pretty similar I
really like the packaging I've used this
like one time and I've just used it over
my Maybelline Dream wonder so I haven't
really been able to tell how much
coverage it gives light is shade is
light enough which I was happy about
this is super affordable I think it
retails between like five and seven
dollars I want to say I'll leave the
link down below where you can get it
this is in the shade 205 which is weird
why does it start at 205 I'm gonna be
using the elf powder brush just go into
town I like to just pack my powder on
first especially if the product
underneath still tacky you're like that
just doing a really good job of covering
up all the freckles and stuff right
there yeah looks good since it is a
powder foundation you could wear this by
itself if you wanted to I personally
can't do that I hate wearing powders by
themselves did give a good amount of
coverage it feels weird to me having
like actual products on my face now
because I've been using the Maybelline
Dream wonder foundation every day and
that like you literally can't tell
anything's on your face so it's weird
actually like being able to see kind of
product on my face right now
it does give good coverage and I mean it
looks it looks fine at this point for
brows I think I'm going to use the NYX
eyebrow gel I use this in another shot
inner shoots video for the price I think
it's awesome it literally stays on
throughout anything you literally need
the tiniest bit so I'm just gonna put a
drop on the back of my hand and then I'm
using a angled brush to apply this I'm
just using this ones buy more if I think
yeah you see more for a morphe
I like my brows to be darkest on the
bottom so I start there and then
whatever is left over on the brush I
kind of brushed through the rest of my
brow there you go this thing you learn
it's like scrub it off the back here Han
I'm gonna be taking an x-ray sin and I'm
just using this brush by six-plus got
this off of ebay I'm gonna contour it up
that brushed it should I done I
think I'm gonna hold off on blush for
now until after we do eyes yeah so when
I ordered the powder I also ordered this
waterproof iya primer I have tried to
pump this for like five minutes to get
the product to come out and I still have
had no luck so I'm hoping its moment
will be now literally nothing is coming
out and you can't like open it or
anything I don't know what the heck is
going on
I might tweet them come on man I really
want to use you all right guess we're
using guys so for eyes I kind of want to
do like a simple neutral eye on top and
then smoke it out with like crazy colors
on the bottom I don't know it's kind of
what I'm picturing in my head right now
prime my eyes I use Mac's painterly
paint-pot I stopped using this stuff for
a little bit I don't know why and now
I'm hooked again so firk face color I've
been all about this middle shade in the
brow part to go palette this is the
lighter trio I created a whole I look
using just these in my last shot in this
video if you want to check that out I've
been literally wearing this in my crease
every single day and it's just the
perfect shade cool my face feels really
soft alright so then we're gonna go in
with Mac uninterrupted which is this
like brown color right here I'm
just gonna add that to the crease a
little bit I'm not gonna blend this down
over my lid oh we go back in with Sigma
e-40 in my lock shadow in shoes I asked
you guys what looks you want to see and
a ton of people said a pin-up look
which I'm totally down to do that'll
probably be the next one because I want
to actually like put some thought into
how I want to do this cuz I'm also gonna
run that on my bottom lash line a little
bit this doesn't have to be clean we
want
bottom lashline to just look really
blended and messy that was a really cute
i shadow face when you're filming you
suddenly become very aware of all of
your makeup faces alright so for the
colors for the bottom lashline i'm gonna
be using this morphe brushes palette i
don't think i've actually used this in a
tutorial or inherit did you know at all
this is number 35 it looks like and
there's just some super fun bright crazy
colors and we started off by taking this
purple shade right here i'm using a 6 +
brush this is actually one of my
favorite brushes right that right now
it's like a small seat brush and it's
really firm so it's good for blending
out color on the bottom lashline i got
these a while ago but if i can find the
link on ebay I'll put it in the down bar
I'm going to take this bright blue color
on the bottom I'm gonna use an angled
brush and just press this bright purple
color into the bottom lashline about the
outer 1/3 so I'm going to take that same
brush we're using before and just blend
all these together feel like we need a
little more Sam so I'm going to go in
with this Sephora called fancy blue and
it's just a liquid bright blue liner
this is like really good right now is
moving I found this in like the bottom
of a cardboard box so got you existed
I'll be winging it right now so you can
see where we flicked it up right here so
I'm going to kind of create the wing to
go along that line this is not an easy
brush to create a wing I'll tell you
that much
I don't even think it's showing up on
camera as bright as it is in real life
it'll do close-up at the end the bottom
lash line is really bothering me so I
think I'm going to try and bring it up a
little bit with like a blue so we get
the same intensity going you know I mean
I'm using this blue shade which is
either from morphe or from Coastal
Scents I think it's from work I'll leave
it down below I'm gonna spray my brush
with some deselect makeup setting spray
just so we can get as much intensity as
we can from this thing there we go I
think I'm just gonna put this on the
outer third so I'm kind of like in the
way that looks gonna pop on some lashes
I feel like we definitely could use some
lashes for this look can't even open
this drawer because there's so much
on my desk right now so I'm going to use
these kiss me 0-3 lashes I got up of
even someone's gonna measure these
against my eye a trimming down then use
my duo strip less pressure on adhesive
this is my favorite lash glue at the
moment I will be right back alright so I
just wanted to zoom you guys in a little
bit so you can see how intense this blue
liner is I think I'm applying a nude
liner to the waterline just to brighten
things up a little bit this is the
Milani brow an eye highlighter and I'm
just using the matte end then I'm going
to apply some wet and wild to make a
plump to the bottom lash line I don't
like this nearly as much as I liked the
wedding route make a length the brush is
just too big but I already have it so
I'm going to use it I'm a little torn on
what to do for lips right now I think
we're gonna do a nude and then also a
black lip just because I feel in the
black lip that it might be too much so
we'll see both so for the new to ish
option I'm gonna use NYX extreme shine
lip cream and this isn't the shade that
natural I just got this yesterday at
Ulta and it is amazeballs it's a really
good peachy nude if you're in the market
for one and look how pigmented this is
they stop talking so here is the lip
option number one now we're gonna go
with the black lip I just realized we
never put any blush on we're gonna do
that I just want something light with
barely any pigmentation I have the
perfect blush for that which is kind of
pointless this is the Too Faced
sweethearts blush and I got this for the
packaging because like how could you not
this kind of a shaky blush I'm kind of
disappointed in it but it is good if you
want barely any new product on your face
I'm used a tiny bit of a highlight just
on the same brush and this is by Paula's
Choice by the way it's just the powder
brush I was going to use the lightest
shade in the Physicians Formula a
shimmer strips thing now we're gonna go
in for the black lip this is going to be
using Manic Panic nosferatu lipstick I
just love this because it's an easy to
work with black lipstick let's do this
what if there was a new trend where we
just wore
stay on like one half of our lip all
right here is lip option number two a
little less wearable but a little more
exciting if you like shout on strizheus
videos be sure to give this a thumbs up
so I know comment down below with any
products you guys want to see in the
future what is sticky all over my hands
lash glue cannot stay in the bottle love
you guys thanks for watching and see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
