rolling with it all right so today we
have a shadow and schmooze on lip I'm
wearing right now a lot of you guys have
been asking on Instagram to see these
two bad boys in a get ready with me
video this is a hard candy new makeup
setting spray and then their new
glamoflage foundation these both of
those today's you can see how they apply
throughout this video
we're also tasting the love with food
box this box basically has new
all-natural snacks haven't mentioned it
in any of my videos but if you're
following me on Twitter you know that
I'm kind of in like a getting healthy
working out doing Jillian Michaels phase
right now mostly just so I feel better
my body feels better so I felt like it
was an appropriate time to test out this
box so we're going to be tasting all the
snacks as we're putting makeup on her
face it's gonna be a good time so if you
want to see how I got this look you're
in the right place just keep watching
all right so I've already primed my face
with the Laura Mercier foundation primer
I got this off of bland but my skin is
looking pretty shitty right now I had to
actually go off of spironolactone what I
was using from the dermatologist because
I had a weird reaction with my migraine
medication but that was fun so I'm going
to be going in with the hard candy
glamoflauge foundation this is an in
foundation I got the shade fair
obviously this is their lighter shade it
is super dark if your skin tone is
similar to mine this won't be light
enough on its own pretty freakin dark
I've mixed this in with the L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte foundation but it
is still a tiny bit dark so today I'm
going to try mixing it in with my Manic
Panic dreamtone this is still like one
of my Holy Grail products I have an
entire video on how to lighten your
foundations I'll link it over here if
you haven't seen that yet the pump in
here is kind of weird but it has a pump
so I'm not complaining well my Manic
Panic is running out but I put about two
pumps of the hard candy and equal of the
Manic Panic alright that's how light we
got it I'm going to start dabbing this
on my face I'm going with the Real
Techniques makeup miracle complexion
sponge whatever it's called because I
just washed all my brushes now that we
have half our face done we're going to
take a break in eat so we're going to
start breaking into this love with food
tasting box they have three different
types of boxes I just have the tasting
one this is for like small samples if
you have a family or you're trying to
like feed multiple people some healthy
snacks then you want to go with the
sighs they also have a gluten-free
option so if you are gluten intolerant
don't worry they've got you covered so
the first thing there's some green tea
in here against milk so these boxes
start at $10 a month I have a coupon
code down below for you guys if you
click that link you can get your first
box for $6 heck yeah I'm gonna start out
with the vintage Italia pasta chips this
is in Cynthiana shade it's our garlic
olive oil oh you smell really good hmm
these are bomb kinda hard to eat while
you're pouncing foundation on your face
didn't really think that through and did
just dye my hair last night hence the
mess of a forehead up here if you like
mixed in with the Manic Panic this is
actually the perfect shade this looks a
lot better than when I mixed it in with
the a L'Oreal my Manic Panic is like
completely over right now chipton when
you're mixing Manic Panic make sure that
it's completely gone in the foundation
you shouldn't be able to see any white
parts and it should look just like one
foundation color the foundation builds
up really nicely I have a lot more
coverage going on the second layer looks
really nice it looks like a natural kind
of dewy finish but just more like a
natural satin finish if you guys have
tried out this foundation let me know
what you think of it down below I can't
really do like a full review on this
since I can't use the product by itself
without mixing stuff in but I like it
like this next snacks in here are these
gluten-free crackers I'm assuming these
are rice crackers sea salt quinoa chips
and it comes with hummus in here wow
this is interesting this is how the
hummus comes this reminds me of those
did you guys have those like push pops
in elementary school it looked exactly
like this
these look like little rice cakes kind
of let's try by itself so I think these
are definitely the kind of chips that
you want to eat with something on top of
them I'm going to crack open this hummus
dip tastes like hummus those are pretty
good I definitely still team garlic
chips right now I'm going in with the
naked skin concealer by Urban Decay I'm
super excited about this stuff this is
my second time wearing it and I loved it
yesterday I literally did not crease at
all underneath my eyes
moisturizing and it gives freakin
amazing coverage I was actually in
Sephora yesterday I'm filming hall after
this and it was the first time they've
gotten complimented on my undereyes
which was kind of strange I just love
how brightening that is I definitely
think the shade fair is light enough I
really like the applicator it's kind of
like a flat doe foot applicator and it
just glides on really nicely I do like
to apply one eye at a time just because
it dries really quickly I'm going to
take my sponge and just kind of blend
over that so we don't have any
fingerprints personally I totally think
this is worth the $28 or $24 whatever
this is and it out I'm going to take my
Holy Grail Physicians Formula powder you
guys have heard me talk about this
literally 5 million times I just like to
press this under the eyes and then
wherever else we put concealer I've been
kind of on this like no powder thing
lately where I literally haven't been
setting my face at all it just makes my
foundation look so much more natural and
like less cakey I don't know I just feel
like I don't really need it right now I
don't know if my skin is just dry my
foundation has just been staying on and
looking a lot better throughout the day
without a powder I'm actually really
liking the look of this foundation with
the Manic Panic so to contour I'm taking
the my sculpted face palette by it
cosmetics I mentioned this in my last
shadow use video but I wanted to use it
again because I hadn't really tried it
out at that point I couldn't tell you
guys my thoughts I've been using this
middle shade right here every single day
I'm telling you it is the most
perfect shade for pale skin ever this
contour shade is just beautiful it is
the best contour shade I've ever found
for my skintone they do have darker
options if you have darker skin than I
do the consistency and everything of
these just blends out beautifully the
only thing I'm not a fan of is this
white powder like they should just take
that out of here because the white
powder doesn't do anything this shade
and the contour shades are just
beautiful my favorite brush to contour
lately has been the Sedona lace 850
brush you'll see just is my foundation
set
so even when my foundation isn't fully
set look at how freakin beautifully that
blends out I'm just freakin obsessed
with this then I like to take the
lighter warmer shade right here and just
put that a little bit on my temples
let's move on to the next snack looks
like the rest of these things are all
sweet there's a Luna Bar in here I'm not
going to taste this one because I'm just
going to put it in my first lemon zest
and this is a mini so I have these
back-to-nature honey graham sticks the
other really cool thing about love with
food is that for every boxes purchase
they donate a box to a food bank or
shelter every box is purchase through my
link down below will be donated to food
bank in Seattle so I just thought that
was really cool
hmm these are bomb they chase way better
than the original graham crackers hell
yeah so for blush I'm going to try out
this Oprah powder cake I got this in the
boxycharm box which I did a whole
unboxing video of I'll link it right
here I'm not sure if this is gonna be
more of a blush or a highlight but we're
gonna find out when i swatched it it
looked like a light peachy kind of color
so we shall see I want like a really
glowy cheek I'm taking my Sedona lace
813 brush
whoa so that's super powdery pretty
pigmented I'm probably gonna have to
blend this out afterwards with the brush
I'm shaking a powder brush to blend that
out so like I said yesterday I went to
Sephora so I'm going to use a couple of
the products in here I'm be having a
full haul video come up after the studio
I think but I wanted to use a couple of
the products just so you can see how
they look the benefit gimme brow this is
in the shade medium deep I've heard a
lot of great things about this product
and I've been really into brow gels
lately I kind of apply it differently
than I think you're supposed to actually
put it on first and then I go in with my
in-store dip brow I feel like I have to
use less dip Brown my brows look more
natural when I do the brow gel first you
also don't have to comb it out with this
coulis because this kind of does it for
you this is a really tiny ass tube it'll
be worth it so this one is supposed to
give you like fiber wow this is a really
tiny brush this wand is a lot smaller
than my Aiko when I've been using this
is supposed to give you kind of like
fiber things on your eyebrows to make
them look
well alright I don't know how that just
happened but it completely just like
filled in my brow I'm in the process of
like re growing out my brow so I can
reshape them so that's why this one's
looking a little strange so you
definitely need some kind of hair for it
to cling to you can see on this side the
parts that I kind of tried to brush over
obviously nothing is showing up but the
side where there's actual hair looks
really good
Peter bread shortbread cookies are
actually really good
when I think of shortbread I think of
those girls have with these which I
don't actually like these are like 59
sweater this is great because I always
forget to eat before film and then by
the end of it feel like I'm pass out you
can kind of feel my brow starting to dry
right now yeah cool I'm just going to
going with my dip brow I'm gonna have a
whole brow routine coming so I think I'm
going to skip over this part just for
the sake of time we're house are done
I'm gonna go back in with the Ofra thing
and just take my Sedona lace 727 I'm
just gonna put my brush in that white
powder and just see if we can get a
little more highlight going on oh hell
yeah
woah I'm gonna go back in with the
powder brush I'm gonna take this down
the bridge of my nose on my Cupid's bow
I've been liking like super dewy
highlighted lately for eyes I'm gonna
take Mac's painterly paint-pot to prime
them I think we're gonna do a super
basic eye look I want to just have
dramatic lashes and like a bold lip and
I might show you guys how I actually
apply my lashes just cuz I don't think
I've ever done that in a video I also
going to take some of this on the bottom
because we're going to be applying a
tiny bit of shadow there I'm going to
take the Sedona lace EB 13 brush and
we're actually going to go back in with
the my sculpted face palette I think
we're only going to use this thing for
the eyes today I'm taking this shade
right here on the blending brush and
we're just gonna plop this in the crease
personally I think that if you're a
beginner or you don't use eyeshadow a
lot using something like a bronzer
palette for your eyeshadow is actually a
lot easier because they just blend out
easier they're less pigmented because
you're putting it on your face not your
eyeball but it can kind of make it
easier to work with I think this is just
giving a tiny bit of definition xmu
taking 904 and we're going to use this
the sec
into darkest brown shade right here
first I'm just going to blend this on
the bottom lashline if there's ever a
day or my eye doesn't water when I do my
bottom lash line be a freaking miracle I
just going to take my finger and take
this highlight shade right here which is
actually really pretty and I'm going to
put this on the lid I love how this is
like just a super nice like natural kind
of Sheen now if you guys can see that
I also no idea if I'm in focus right now
take a tiny bit of that and put it on my
inner corner that's actually really
pretty on the inner corner I'm gonna go
in with lashes and we might be doing
some more to the eyes I'm not sure kind
of one just put on dramatic lashes and
see what happens
last is sour beans those it's a hundred
percent of your daily vitamin C
pedigrees hmm they totally get better as
you keep to him what's your least
favorite can't you flavor comment down
below I can't do great but reminds me of
cough medicine the other ones were good
though what are we doing I'm going with
glam 12 bye I'm emo there we go lash
glue is a kiss lash adhesive and I'm
just putting this directly onto the band
I love this brush on this thing because
it's just like a silicone little piece
of material it's super easy to brush on
exactly where you want it and you know
it's kind of ready to put on your eye
when it turns this like bluish color so
there's nothing super special to how I
put on lashes I know some people use
tweezers some people have like different
methods
my biggest tip with applying lashes to
just let it dry for about 30 seconds I
put it on my eye when it's like almost
dry like super tacky that way it's not
like sliding around all over your
eyeball I usually use a mirror and look
down so you want to put your mirror
directly below you so you're able to
still have your eye open but your lid is
down we're just gonna chill and get
Sowerby into all this dress personally I
like to apply my mascara afterwards
because I like to blend it in with the
lash some people like to do it before
whatever floats your boat
so I like to set the middle part down
first and make sure that stacking up and
not sliding then I go ahead and do the
outer part and I'm literally just
pressing with my finger the inner part
is the most important because that's for
me that's the part that's hardest to fix
if you mess it up
so I just like to hold it here and kind
of press down I try not to like look up
or mess it up well it's dry
I love the glam 12 ones they look like
um what's called like velour lashes or
something mink lashes that's what I was
looking for never worn these without
eyeliner and I think I like it even
better these kind of look like Mac 35s
without eyeliner if you have like a
weirdly short eyebrow to lash length
that was so badly worded if you have
like no room between your lashes and
your eyebrows like I do now look up my
lashes like are my eyebrows if that's
you I kind of like to push them down so
rather than going up they go out a
little bit more it's totally just
depends on your eye shape and what you
like look at how much bigger falsies
make your eyes look that is insane I
also love that these have a black band I
like don't really even need to go over
it with eyeliner all right then I'm
going to go in with my Maybelline lash
sensational and apply mascara to blend
them in I like to turn my brush like
this so I can just kind of push them
into the natural lash so I'm going to
smoke out the bottom lash line just a
tiny bit more we're going to go in with
the same brush and then just the darkest
shade in this palette mostly putting
this on the outer third black step for
the eye is going to go in with my wet
mild make a length mascara on the bottom
lashes the eyes are done before we do
lips I'm going to spray my face with a
setting spray my holy grail setting
spray is Loreal Pro infallible spreading
spritz setting spray today we're going
to be trying out the hard candy fast and
fabulous setting spray this is the first
time I'm using this obviously I haven't
seen any reviews or heard anything about
this yet by the way I ordered both the
foundation and the setting spray online
from Walmart I'll have everything linked
down below like always say let's test
out the spray to see how intense this
it looks like a nice mist I just got a
shower smells like cucumber spraying new
sprays on for the first time sighs hoes
gay one do you think there's actually a
lot more intense than it looks
I can feel like four patches on my face
definitely smells like cucumber feels
really wet it's taking a lot longer to
dry than the lorry alone does if you're
not using a setting spray you need to be
it literally changes your foundation
game I also find that since I'm not
using powders now that definitely helps
to keep it on and it just makes
everything look like together lips jcat
beauty basically sent me a ton of
their lip wonder lip paints and they
have tons of really cool colors I'm
tempted to just use the black and do a
black lip maybe we'll do an orange I
don't think I've done an orange lip ever
wish you guys were here so you could
like a live vote I think we're going to
go in with orange and test it out so
this is in the shade amuse us and I'm
just going to put a tiny bit on the back
of that palette which is clean now by
the way and I'm gonna finish off these
old chips so dipping this brush into the
orange and a wipe up I have a little bit
of vaseline on my lips right now using a
brush actually makes my life way easier
because with the lip ring it's just easy
to get on the other side hell yeah
kinda feel like a pumpkin but I'm
rolling with it I do this I like to just
study my hand by putting my elbow on my
hip a lot harder for your hands like
wobbling all over the place I top lip is
like hardest part of my makeup for me to
do a lot of the times it doesn't end up
like a crisp line like that and that's
okay you can just take it off put some
more foundation on your brush and just
go over your top lip and then just try
again alright so this is the final look
I just want to show you guys a close-up
so you can see what everything looks
like I think my skin looks really great
in this foundation I just really like
the finish of it and the coverage that
it gives not sure how I feel about this
lip color but with this kind of eye look
you could literally do any kind of lip
color that you wanted so again make sure
to check the down bar if you want to
check out love with food and get your
first box half off if you guys like this
