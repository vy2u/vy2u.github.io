the look I'm wearing right now like I'm
not moving when I'm talking right now
cuz I'm like holding the full coffee cup
just put a do I use some really exciting
products in this video a lot of products
that I've been holding off to try for
you guys for video you want to see this
look then you can just keep watching
does laundry you really have to be done
or should I just keep filming question
of the day doing my hair just wasn't
happening today so we're going to deal
with the heavier so for foundation
lately I've been using the elf acne
fighting foundation and this is way too
dark the lightest shade so to lighten it
I mix it in with my Manic Panic
dreamtone if you haven't heard me talk
about this then you're probably a very
new subscriber so welcome and I have
like 10,000 videos where I talk about
this so that's what we're doing to apply
this I'm going to be using my Real
Techniques damp miracle makeup sponge
just been liking the way it's applying I
actually have to mix in a couple pumps
of Manic Panic with this foundation
because it's that dark this combo gives
super good coverage I love the way that
it makes my skin look just makes it look
really like healthy and flawless so I'm
super excited for today's shadow and
mousse because I'm using a ton of new
products this sponge is super affordable
you can get it off of Amazon or at Ulta
it'll change your makeup game sometimes
just got to make a dub Shin while you're
blending pull the headband back a little
for a sec it's kind of strange alright
so for concealer I'm going to use
something that I'm super excited about
got it in my glam bought purchase if you
don't know what glam bought is it's a
website where you can buy use makeup and
you can also sell your own makeup to
make cash if you want to if you saw my
Instagram picture of the Chanel so light
an additional whatever bronzer that is
where I got it and basically it's like
use makeup cheaper than if you would buy
it from like a retail store they tell
you how much of it is left they tell you
the retail value and the really
thing is that they're like awesome about
cleaning it they have like a five-step
sanitation process so if you're like a
germaphobe don't worry about it they
come in these bags which I think are
really funny they literally look like
sterilization bags they put these little
stickers on it so you can tell that no
one has opened it I guess I'll just show
you what else I got
so the concealer going to be using is a
smashbox high def concealer also got
this NARS matte lipstick which I'm super
excited about and then the Chanel
bronzer that I'm going to be using in
today's video I haven't opened this yet
and I'm so freaking excited I've been
waiting to do it on camera if you want
to try out glambot I have the 10% off
link below that you can use I'm just
mixing in my NYX HD concealer and
lavender because this concealer looks
way too dark like usual and that's the
lightest shade feels really nice and
creamy so far really easy to blend out I
always like to run it over the top of my
eye too just to cancel out any veiny
things or freckles or whatever all my
blinds are open right now so I hope it's
bright enough you guys seem to like the
lighting in the Seattle update video so
I think it works speaking of the Seattle
update video thank you so much for all
of your awesome comments I've been kind
of like overwhelmed lately just really
awesome to just something nice to come
home to if you didn't see that video I'm
going to be at vlogger fair on August
16th if you're in Washington you should
go and we can be friends alright so to
set my under eye concealer I'm going to
be using my Physicians Formula
translucent retching powder like always
I really hope I'm in focus I'm starting
to think that I might need glasses since
I am going to be using a kind of mousse
bronzer or whatever you want to call
this I'm not gonna powder my face I
might do my forehead afterwards we'll
see what I'm feeling I literally cannot
believe this is sitting in my hands
right now
it's the so light and a Chanel bronzer
and this is like one of those products
that just has always been super talked
about and is apparently amazing and I've
never gotten around to trying it because
it's frickin expensive so when I saw it
on glam box website and it was marked
down I was like hell yeah so this is
what I mean like look at how cool the
way they package it is it just
feels like it's new even though it's not
and it looks like they definitely like
cleaned up the surface so that's really
nice like I said all of my brushes
literally are packed away so I'm going
to be using this it cosmetics brush and
this is from the celebration foundation
illumination which I have to get ready
with me video using this brush is so
freaking nice especially for contouring
because it's kind of like the NARS eita
brush but it's not like a normal shitty
brush that you get in light compacts
it's an actual really nice brush super
excited let's just do it but feel like
we need dramatic music right now can't
tell if I'm getting anything on here so
with this kind of brush what you want to
do is create the contour line which go
from the top of your ear to the corner
of your mouth not all the way down I
don't want to do that I like to just
draw the line first and then we're going
to go in and go upwards a little bit
here's the end of Cold War - I'm going
to do the other side and decide if I
want to do it more intense contour or
not but I'm feeling this it looks really
nice and natural oh there we go
I have cheekbones I think I am going to
powder just my forehead I think I'm
going to hold out on the blush and
highlight for now until after we're done
with the eyes so for brows I'm going to
be using Anastasia and nostalgia dip
brow pomade and this is in the shade
dark brown and I'm using a mini ass
Ecotools brush this thing's like my
favorite so I'm just going to do this
and then I'll be back
got my brows on that took a lot less
time than expected it probably could've
kept it going bird eyes shadow primer
I'm using the hard candy eyes shadow
primer you can get this at Walmart so
for eyeshadows today I'm going to be
trying out the new Milani gel what are
they called bella eyes gel powder eye
shadow holy crap Milani sent out PR
boxes to bloggers and stuff it was
unreal if you're following my Twitter
you saw it but I literally think I can
open up a nail salon right now I have so
many freaking nail polishes and then all
of the brand new gel eyeshadows they're
all like sitting back there right there
alright so this looks like a super nice
kind of orange e crease color so I'm
going to use Bella Mandarin this is a
satin matte and I haven't tried these
i've swatched a couple of them before
but I haven't actually worn them yet it
has kind of
the bouncy Maybelline blush you know I'm
talking about it kind of looks like that
feels like a normal eye shadow to me I
don't know but they're super pigmented
like look at that and just put this in
the crease I'm here feels like it's like
a mile away right now next I think I'm
going to go in with Bella copper lips
I'm just going to use my finger for this
whoa this one is super pigmented you can
see that that is such a freaking pretty
color do you guys see this what the hell
I don't think I saw any like matte dark
shades that they send so I'm just going
to use my revealed 2 palette and I'm
going to use my holy grail shade the one
that's similar to Mac embark and we're
just gonna put this in the outer third
of my eye I'm gonna have a pretty
intense smoky eye for going to the post
office today whatever is leftover on the
brush I just like to super lightly drag
inwards just to kind of cut that crease
and then we're going to go back and
blend everything out what's new with you
guys how's your summer been I don't even
feel like it's summer right now because
I'm working like there is no such thing
as summer anymore it's kind of weird to
not have breaks or anything like that
anymore
alright so I'm going to go back in with
the brush we use for blending think I
need a mirror
the thing I love about the reveal
shadows is that they blend out so
freakin easy so I'm going to run
whatever's left over on the brush on my
bottom lash line I'm going back in with
Bella Mandarin for the inner corner I'm
going to be using this like shimmery
light color and this is Bella chiffon
okay I'm guessing they all say Bella
furs and I'm using just a sigma e30
pencil brush for this go ahead and apply
it and then we're going to spray some
Urban Decay all nighter setting spray on
my brush just to make it extra pigmented
on a real intense highlight today and
then let's just go to town I'm also
applying is to my Cupid's bow because
why not think I'm feeling a little bit
of waterline eyeliner today so I'm using
the LA girl glide on gel
and black this stuff is super freakin
black I think I got this from Ike eight
house I want to say I send them blend
that out I'm going to take the same what
does this pencil brush kind of you know
blend so then for a wing I'm going to
use my Physicians Formula
eye booster gel liner like always this
is one of those days where the eye liner
just keeps getting bigger and bigger and
there's no stopping it so for my scares
are going to do the usual Mac prep and
prime I've been using the falsies brush
but with the miss manga formula and I've
been really liking it lately and for the
bottom I'm using the Wet n Wild mega
length like always so our eyes are done
for blush I'm going to be using the
L'Oreal True Match blush in innocent
flush I think I've had this for forever
it used to be one of my favorite blushes
using the cosmetics brush that came with
the celebration foundation illumination
probably my favorite foundation name to
say so for lips I think I'm going to do
a nude I've been really feeling the nude
lips lately knees Maybelline's 860
smooth taupe and these smell like
crayons but you can overlook it then
they're good because this one is like a
border line I'm dead nude I'm going to
go in with whitening lightening and
butter cream this is like what I've been
wearing every single day for work to use
my username you can get 25% off
everything I've always forget there's a
little mirror on here and a spray my
urban decay and then we are good to go
alright so this is the final look if you
guys like this video and you like shadow
into his videos be sure to give this
video a thumbs up so I know like always
if you're curious about something I used
all of the information is down below the
nail polish color everything you need to
know is down below my freaking earrings
because I get asked about them more than
anything are from Old Navy and they were
like $5 I don't know if they still have
them but they're from Old Navy love you
