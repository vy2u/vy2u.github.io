get ready with me video is plop some
brown stuff on my eyes I think pretty
much everything I used on my eyes today
I have never used in a video before even
switched up the mascara you know shopper
it is a talk through get ready with me
type video so if you like those then
just keep watching alright so I already
did my face and brows clearly I've
gotten some pretty bad cystic acne on my
chin so I didn't want to switch up my
foundation routine so you guys have seen
me use these before I just used the
Revlon Colorstay and covergirl Ready Set
gorgeous foundation I have a review on
this and I've used this before all the
product info that I used on the rest of
my face will be linked down below if you
want to know what I used so I'm kind of
feeling like a warm brown kind of smoky
eye that's what I'm thinking but it'll
probably change so I'm gonna start by
priming my eyes with Mac's Paint Pot in
genuine treasure this is a super unique
color is actually part of a limited
edition collection I think my other
Paint Pot is so old that now using this
new one it feels like super different
texture like this one actually blends
out yeah my tripod is on my wipe don't
have an exciting cut for you guys this
time sorry so I have a concoction of Mac
slash Coastal Scents slash morphe
eyeshadows I'm just going to be using
more I think it's 15 all the info will
be down below but this is just a good
transition color for the crease and I'm
using that on a sigma e40
so when you guys are watching this it is
June 14th this probably won't be up to
like end of June I'm pre recording a
shit ton of videos because literally in
the next two weeks I will be too busy to
function I like to do circular motions
where I want the most product and we're
just gonna do like when shield wipers to
blend it inwards so for the lid color
I'm going to use L'Oreal infallible
eyeshadow in bottomless Java I just
found this sitting in the back of my
drawer haven't been able to open that
drawer for literally two months and I
finally got the shit out bam treasures
this stuff is super pigmented it comes
with this little like press thing in
here so I just like to use my finger to
apply this and you literally just need
to like tap it in it's so pigmented and
then we're just going to plat this on
the lid de L'Oreal infallible infallible
why is that word so hard to say L'Oreal
and valuable eyeshadows are probably
some of my favorites from the drugstore
wait until L'Oreal goes like 40% off and
then just stock up on these that's what
I do
I'm also pretty sure it's impossible to
hit pan on one of these because you
literally just need to dab your finger
in so if you've been following my
Instagram or Twitter you know that I
drove up to Seattle with my best friend
on my birthday for a job interview the
next day birthday was pretty uneventful
because I had to wake up at like 7:00 in
the morning for the job interview but
got the job best birthday present ever
I'm super excited gonna be moving up to
Seattle in two weeks make sure you're
following my Instagram Twitter things
like that so you can be caught up live
South website the interview was freaking
intense it's literally a three hour
interview there were like six different
people that I talked to we made it
I'm just going back in with the Sigma
e-40 and blending everything out also
wanted to say thank you so much for
everyone who commented on that Instagram
picture there was a shit ton of comments
and you guys were being super supportive
and super nice and I so appreciate it it
made the day that much more exciting so
thank you for your comments it was
awesome I'm retaking Mac's Brown script
which is probably my favorite shade for
Mac it's like a warm brown color and I'm
just popping this in the crease feel
like I have not had an
caffeine this morning
Mack Brown script is one of those colors
that literally looks good on every
single skin tone every single eye color
so if you haven't gotten it already go
get it I know makeup geek makes one
called
Coco bear or some shit I haven't tried
any makeup geek eyeshadows let me know
what you guys think of them should I get
them I don't know what's new with you
guys Congrats on everyone who graduated
high school college whatever your
graduating or if you're just living life
congrats to you to you live life I found
a random apartment in Seattle that I'm
going to be subletting for the summer
the other girl that's living with me is
this exact same age as me exact same
situation she has like a summer thing
that she's working in Seattle for and
she's from Miami so that'll be fun I
usually have pretty good luck with
roommates so I don't really stress out
about that kind of easygoing used to
live with so hopefully she's cool
so I'm just gonna go back in with
javabean or whatever this is called
bottomless Java when you put a matte
eyeshadow over sometimes a shimmer gets
kind of disappears so we're just putting
this on a little bit more if you can't
formulate sentences today so then on
just a cheap elf brush you can get these
at Target for like a dollar I'm just
going to put brown script again on my
bottom lash line and just connect that
color to right here I really want to add
like a pop of color or something kind of
feeling it all I'm doing today is really
unentertaining Aaron's like selling
textbooks and washing my car because my
whole family comes tomorrow so I'm like
frantically trying to make it look like
I clean my house and things also trying
to pre-record like three videos today so
you guys have things to watch really
feel like I need a little some some
think we're going to be adventurous and
take this like teal color from Coastal
Scents I think we're just going to plop
this up here
then I'm just going to take this super
dark brown color from Coastal Scents and
put this in the outer corner oh crap I
forgot I was gonna do a red lip now
we're going to look like a Christmas
tree for eyeliner I think I'm going to
go out of my comfort zone and use the
morphe brushes gel eyeliner and black
mainly using this day because I'm out of
my Physicians Formula stuff super basic
love this stuff it's easy to use it's
super black so I like to use an angled
brush to apply this it's just a lot
easier to make a wing with an angled
brush in my opinion so I just like to
draw on the base if you open your eye
you can kind of see where you want your
wing to be if you have a hooded eyelid
this is a good tip make sure you open
your eye and then kind of just press it
where you want it to be and then close
it and drag it along and there you go
one wing done one to go
so for mascara I'm just gonna be trying
out the new L'Oreal voluminous miss
manga mascara I've heard a lot of people
talking about this stuff so let's see
how it works I guess
mangas are like a Japanese anime cartoon
thing this mascara is supposed to give
you that like anime eyelash effect I
don't know
Packaging is super cute I like the pink
it feels very big and wrap my whole hand
around this thing so like always I'm
going to start out with my Mac prep and
prime this is just a white eyelash
primer I can't go a day without using
this stuff now so this has like a flecks
brush thing which is always kind of
interesting to me because I feel like
when you're actually applying it like
how much is this thing gonna Bend
oh there it goes now it's bending
I like the formula of it like usual with
L'Oreal mascaras it is a pretty wet
formula which I really like not sure how
I feel about the whole flex brush
situation it's kind of more difficult to
get it to really get in your lashes
because it is like moving all over the
place so far I don't think it's anything
super extraordinary pretty standard but
we'll see what happens once we apply a
second coat it's so weird for that okay
waiting is you see what I mean I feel
like we're both just wobbling all over
the place alright so there is one layer
of Miss manga I'm gonna go in for a
second one and see what happens we're
out real weird angles right now remember
realized how much I like contort my body
while putting on mascara until filming
it alright so the second layer is on and
I wanted to zoom you guys in so you
could really see I don't know if you can
tell with the eyeliner on but I think
the miracle started to work on the
second layer it's really good at
separating and giving you those spidery
lashes without looking super clumpy I
really like how it looks actually after
the second layer first layer wasn't very
impressed and they also feel very like
flexible you know I mean it's not like
you have like crispy lashes the bottom
mascara I'm gonna stick with my wet n
Wild mega length mascara just because I
got who can't branch away from the stuff
so for lips I'm gonna be using my RiRi
lipstick I think this was just called
nude mine's like worn off on the bottom
but this is a super unique kind of color
and waiting to use this in a video think
today's a day this is a matte lipstick
which I'm all about so there you go this
color is like weirdly appealing to me I
kind of feel like I just smudged milk
chocolate on my lips but I kind of
really like it what do you guys think of
this color alright so this is what we
went for today if you like this video
and you like shadow and schmooze videos
be sure to give it a thumbs up so I know
that during the whole time I'm actually
pleasantly surprised with this miss
manga shit love you guys thanks for
watching tonight's video fight
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
