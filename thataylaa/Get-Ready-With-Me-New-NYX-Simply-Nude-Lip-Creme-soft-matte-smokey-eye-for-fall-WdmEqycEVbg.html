button all right so today we have a
shadow inch man's video on the look I'm
wearing right now it's my camera and
straight right now that's it look so
crooked I'm in the middle of filming so
many videos right now that I can't
remember if I already filmed an intro
for this so we're just filming it again
don't have an exciting coffee cup for
you today just pouring water I'm in the
middle of filming a first impression
video on the new YSL fusion ink
foundation so if you want to see this
video it'll be up after this so make
sure you're subscribed so you don't miss
out on that so today's video I did the
rest of my face use some new essence
products and went for kind of a warm
matte brown smokey eye I think this
could be perfect for the Fall especially
if you pair it with a dark lipstick I
know the pin-up look still isn't up I'm
going to try and film that tomorrow I've
been very busy but very in the filming
mood lately so you guys will have a lot
of videos coming out though if you want
to see how I got this look then you're
in the right place just keep watching
all right so I do have my foundation on
right now because I'm currently filming
a first impressions video it'll be uh
after this video I think so if you want
to see what's on my face make sure
you're subscribed so you don't miss out
on that I'm just gonna do the rest of my
face makeup and eyes and yeah so for
concealer I kind of wanna use this up
I'm not a huge fan of this I think it's
okay I actually like my Revlon concealer
more but this is the Smashbox high def
concealer and I'm going to be mixing
that with NYX HD concealer in lavender
just to lighten it up gotta say I do
really like the shade of this foundation
I think it looks pretty good so I'm just
gonna Pat my concealer under my eyes the
Smashbox concealer does have a really
nice kind of dewy finish which I like
but then when you set it with the powder
it kind of takes that away it does blend
really easily and it feels very smooth I
got this concealer off of glambot by the
way way marked down
I'll leave the link down below but I
think you can get 40% off your first
purchase which is insane I'm obsessed
with them so I'm whatever is left over
on the back of my hand I'm just gonna
Pat on any acne and acne scarring it's
actually starting to go down right now
if you saw my how to cover acne video my
skin was freakin insane at that point it
was going through a purge phase I think
we're starting to recover and I got
purple all over my hand like always
setting the under-eye concealer with
Physicians Formula translucent light
setting powder obsessed with this stuff
I'm just going to put a little bit of
this on my t-zone
and chin where I had that concealer I'm
not gonna powder to the rest of my face
since we are doing a first impression
and it has a powder finish so no need to
powder for bronzer I'm trying out the
essence Sun Club bronzer this is in the
shade blonds for lighter skin apparently
looks pretty dark so we will see how
this works is this start whoa there we
go I just figured out how to work my
camera I mentioned this product in my
fall haul video which I'll link over
here if you missed that I got this from
Fred Meyer and I'm looking for good
bronzers for fair skin so in trying to
mole out so I'm just going to do slight
contour with this stuff and blend it in
my cheekbones actually looks pretty nice
blended out super well brush hairs
everywhere personally I don't like to
apply my bronzer on my forehead or
anything usually because I just feel
like it looks makes me look darker than
I want to be that's not a common
sentence so I'm gonna be taking the
blush of ombre blush how freaking
beautiful is this maybe I should open it
pseudo no flare this is so pretty this
reminds me of one of the Mac I think was
from the aquatic collection wasn't I
wasn't aquatic Frederik Lorenzo I don't
know it is so beautiful it blends so
nicely whoa I just got way too much oh
that's why this feels weird
why did I use this part I'm going to go
in with my favorite it cosmetics plush
brush feels so good look at this love me
some blush go back in with my powder
brush and just blend hi
alright so for browsing and be using NYX
eyebrow gel I love this stuff it's like
5 bucks around there and it's waterproof
and it's amazing
I've been kind of liking the more
rounded in full brows lately I don't
know sometimes it happens sometimes it
doesn't you know you have that one brow
that's just so much harder to get the
shape right
shout out to my ring bro I'm gonna spray
my face now with my Urban Decay just
life I like doing a performer I make up
just so I don't get any mascara or
anything everywhere so good I think I'm
feeling kind of a matte warm brown
smokey eye so I'm going to start it with
makeup geek Peach Smoothie I joined the
cult following I also got a few pigments
let me know down below if you guys want
to see them in a shadow inch maids video
I'm gonna take Peach Smoothie which is
just this perfect like transition shade
right here type are my eyes nope alright
and use Mac's painterly paint-pot like
always to prime the eyes alright now
we're going in with peach movie so using
a sigma e40 the blend this onto the
crease can't tell if it's too bright
right now there we go
this shade is great because since it is
so subtle you can be really messy with
it alright then I'm going to take this
elf eyeshadow this is in the shade brick
this is really a similar to Mac Brown
script and it's about $10 less just
gonna apply this to the outer third of
the eye I'm also gonna put this on the
inner portion I've been kind of like in
doing dark on the inner and outer when
you're using loose pigments like this
make sure you tap off your brush before
you apply it to your face or else you're
gonna have Brown all over your face son
I'm just going to flip my brush so it's
sideways and blend upwards a little bit
and go back in with a little Peach
Smoothie on the Sigma e-40 and blend
next I'm going to go in with my lorac
Pro palette any
like cream matte shades that you have
will work just fine I'm going to take
the shade cream and just apply that to
the center of my eye I'm also going to
go in with a white matte shade and also
pop that on top of the cream feeling
like I want to deepen everything up a
little bit so I'm going to go in with
expresso from the lorac palette and
we're just gonna put this on the outer
third then we're gonna go in and blend
leaving this a little bit into the
crease just because the aquitted lids
this is just gonna help make you look
like you actually have a lid all right
done with the upper shadows I'm gonna go
back in with Peach Smoothie and this is
just an elf and you know with this color
we're going to take Peach Smoothie on
the bottom lash line this is like the
worst putting eyeshadow on your bottom
lash line legs rough and I'm gonna go
back in with the elf shadow kind of feel
in a white on the waterline I'm going T
Sigma highlighting pencil in matte this
is good if you don't want it to be super
stark white base don't want your
waterline to look right and open you can
also use this under your brow bone or
wherever alright remember your card is
getting full so I need to get my
together and wrap it up here for
eyeliner I'm just going to go in with
the usual Physicians Formula I booster
pen this is in the shade ultra black
make sure you get the ultra black one
because the other ones are not as black
not as good it's going to create kind of
a wing or whatever I feel like with this
there we go it's an easy one I think we
just need a little assumption to
something I'm going with my Sigma e30
pencil brush and then take that same
white shade and just pop that in the
inner corner pretty close into my nose
or whatever that area is it's gonna give
the illusion that you are more awake and
have bigger eyes I've also been liking
putting this shade on my Cupid's bow
just to highlight without having this
shimmer or anything so I was gonna throw
on some mascara I use the Mac prep and
prime Maybelline falsies the non
waterproof version and then wet and wild
make a plump for the bottom lashes but I
wouldn't recommend this I'm just trying
to use it up I like wet wild mega length
the best for the bottom lashes so what
happens when you try and do your mascara
in like two seconds
trick if you have to get mascara off
wait for it to dry and then go in with a
concealer brush and it should just come
right off there you go so for lips I'm
gonna go in with the NYX simply nude lip
cream what is this yes this is from the
new simply collection let me know if you
want a whole review on these I have four
of them this is in the shade sable by
the way and I'm obsessed with this color
then I'm gonna go in with dried
cosmetics sugar mama because I can't go
without this stuff when I do a nude lip
I'm just applying this mainly to the
center of my lip I do have a 25% off
code if you guys want to try this thing
out alright so this is the final look if
you liked this video and you like shadow
to MU this videos give this a thumbs up
so I know comment down below with any
products so you guys want me to use in
future shadow and schmooze videos what
is going on with my hair just can't be
tamed today no I mean if you want to see
a first impression on the foundation I'm
wearing right now check the down bar
because it'll be up after this video
