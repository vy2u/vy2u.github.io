with a serious face so we're gonna start
off with foundation I'm using the new
over mostly matte foundation which I've
been obsessively it's been my go-to
foundation I just really like the shade
for my skin and it's hard to find this
foundation this pale under my skin tone
and this is perfect and I'm blending
that in with a sigma f80 flat top kabuki
brush and the work will be down below
and I'm gonna go in with my covergirl
concealer and this is just continue
baking get it on eBay so I'm the only
concealer so I found that doesn't crease
on me so I love it
I'm gonna set it with foremost a matte
powder which is amazing I'm coming
through my brows there we go setting the
concealer and this is my first video
with my new camera the Canon t3i if
you're wondering comment down below and
let me know if the quality's better
because it should be now I'm gonna do my
eyes priming my eyes with Mac's
painterly paint-pot like always and then
I'm using the second shade from the left
on this Judy's time palette just to
create the transition colors it's
perfectly fair skin because it's not too
dark and then
I'm going to do my brows really quick I
have a whole brow routine coming so I
didn't show you guys this video but that
will be up soon
then I'm using this new elf matte
eyeshadow that I got and this is in the
shade brick super comparable to Mac's
Brown script so if you don't want to
spend $15 on eyeshadow go with the elf
one for three dollars and I didn't
mention this yet but I did buy a
ton of new stuff from elf so I'm kind of
trying out the B products in this video
I am using NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk
and creative faceless shadow this is the
elf long lasting lustrous shadow and
those she will be down below I can't
think of it right now it looks super
pretty it's a super weird like bouncy
consistency I'm clearly confused and
it's not as pigmented as I expected so I
am going to use the Naked 3 palette to
go over that because I wanted a little
more color and I was quite satisfied now
we're using the shade fuzz from the
Naked 3 and I'm going to pop this on my
lid with my finger you get way better
color color payoff with the Naked 3
palette if you use your finger rather
than a shader brush then i'm going to
run nooner on my bottom lash line to
create some dimension and then I'm going
to use a card so we can get a sharp line
and I'm gonna go in with black heart
then I'm going back in with a clean
blending brush services buy more
freshest calm and I'm just blending out
the edges so we don't have any harsh
lines kind of just blend people now I'm
going in with an angled foundation brush
to clean up that line and then the
eyeliner going to be using as my
favorite L'Oreal super slim liner which
is a liquid liner for the top and then
the carbon black extra intense liner for
the waterline right here I'm just
nudging Blackheart on the outer third of
my eye to create a little bit more smoky
look but I'm gonna go in with my
everyday bronzer and this is Sephora
brand in the shade of the Hama literally
use this a lot
I'm just contouring my face when I'm
gonna run this along my forehead for
blush I tried out the elf H blush in the
shade pink diamonds which was pretty
freakin shitty you can't even see it if
nothing came off then I went with my
trusty wet and wild blush in pearlescent
pink and then applying this with a more
stippling brush and then to highlight my
cheekbones and using another elf a
highlighter in this marionette fashion
pink this one I liked a little bit
better I don't know how much I liked it
for a highlighter but if you use this
every can all over
more slowly look I think would be really
pretty since I didn't want more
highlighted look I'm going to go in with
my mary-lou manizer highlighter by the
balm which I use every single day and
you'll see in a second it deserves it
click right here hold on one second
there you go look at it so beautiful and
deposits down my nose and then in my
t-zone chin Cupid's bow just to kind of
make my face not look so mad I'm using
my Urban Decay setting spray to set
everything in and here's the mascaras
I'm gonna be using I tried out the elf
mascara primer and I don't know I think
it's good if you want a cheap primer I
prefer the max prep and prime primer I
noticed a huge difference in my lashes
when I use that this I didn't really
notice that much of a difference and I'm
using the elf mineral infused mascara
it's a good lengthening and separating
but I wanted a little more volume so I
went in with my L'Oreal carbon black
mascara and now for lips I'm using royal
little Lac I'm using L'Oreal the L'Oreal
will lack in what is this shade it will
be down below
and now you know you just got to take
your Instagram selfies so here you go
this is the final look this is my get
ready with me video thumbs up if you
like this this is what happens behind
the scenes guys thumbs up if you like
this video and I will see you guys next
time
