the look I'm wearing right now got a
little creative with the eyes I used
brow bar 2 goes as eye shadow which is
really great if you're in a rush in the
morning and you just need something fast
it's what I've been doing in the morning
for work and I really like it when to
Walgreens and spend more money on makeup
for you guys so I tell myself if you
want to see what's on my face then just
keep watching all right so I've clearly
already applied my foundation and brows
I'm currently filming a first impression
on the Maybelline Dream wonder fluid
touch liquid foundation that was long
but time you guys are watching this
video that video will have already been
up so I will link it over here if you
want to see my thoughts on the
Maybelline Dream wonder so I have no
idea what we're doing right now
so for concealers I'm going to use this
Smashbox high def concealer mixed in
with my next HD and lavender to lighten
it up and I got this matchbox concealer
discounted from glambot it's a super
awesome like used makeup site I have a
10% off link that you can use down below
if you want to check it out I don't know
why I'm using my second finger right now
it never used this finger let's switch I
wish that I could set my concealer
without losing that like luminosity that
it gives off because I really like that
but just gotta set your concealer nice
rough I don't want to put anywhere I
normally highlight the rest of my face
like on my forehead and bridge of the
nose and stuff because I am filming a
first impression right now so I don't
want to mess with that foundation I
don't know where to put this right now
makeup wipe where are you then I'm
studying the under eye concealer with
Physicians Formula translucent light
setting powder I don't really want to
powder my whole face because we are
doing a first impressions video like I
said so for a little bit of a contour
I'm gonna be going in with my Physicians
Formula shimmer strips for nude thing
yeah this brush is still broken so for
blush I'm using the same product I'm
just going in with the pink shades for
this I'm using my
a cosmetics brush this came with the
celebration foundation and illumination
which I have a couple videos mentioning
but I have been obsessed with this brush
for blush as you can see this just gives
you a super pretty glow so then I like
to set my whole face with the urban
decay just like makeup setting spray
what was life like before setting sprays
alright so that's everything that I'm
doing on the face today I feel like that
was really fast so they didn't have to
do brows I have literally no idea what
we're doing on the eyes right now I need
to figure it out
alright so for primer I'm gonna be using
Mac's painterly paint-pot I need to get
a new one because mine is pretty dried
out these are awesome bases for
eyeshadows probably one of my favorite
primers ever so in the morning for work
I've literally just been reaching for
the simplest easiest things I can throw
in my face at 6:30 in the morning so
I've actually been using the brow bar to
goes for my eyes just because then I can
do my brows in my eyes at the same time
super fast
they don't have shades on the back but I
think there's only a light and a darker
set I could be wrong there might be
three this middle shade and the lightest
brow bar is a perfect transition color
for the crease it's literally just the
perfect shade for me
these aren't technically for your eyes
obviously but I do find this since
they're a brow powder they actually last
a little bit better because I have that
kind of brow powder consistency so if
you don't have time in the morning you
just want something fast I would
definitely pick this up because you can
get the middle shade and this shade and
do a super easy fast I look it just
makes everyone's life a little bit
easier you know so because I have that
Mac painterly paint-pot as a base which
is a cream shadow I'm not actually going
to be putting a shadow on my lids
because it does cover up my freckles and
things like that on my eyes so I'm going
in with that same palette what is this
called a trio or palette that's called a
trio going in with that same a trio and
I'm using this darker kind of ashy Brown
shade I'm just gonna be applying this to
the outer third of my eye so after we
have that color on there I'm going to go
back in with my blending brush and just
blend everything together so you could
totally stop here with the shadow but if
you want a little bit more smoke we're
gonna smoke it out and use the darker
shade of the brow
and I'm just using the darkest shade in
this trio I'm just gonna define the
crease a little bit more and we're just
gonna add some smoke but this one I'm
just super lightly placing the color and
then blending it about 1/3 of the way in
then what we're gonna do is turn our
brush and blend it upwards so I'm gonna
run whatever is left over on that brush
on the bottom lash line then on the
Sigma e30 pencil brush I'm gonna go in
with the darkest shade and put this on
the outer 1/3 of the eye so to highlight
the inner corner of our eye I'm gonna go
back in with the shimmer bricks and use
my finger with this lightest white shade
this is a perfect perfect highlight
shade you can see how pigmented that is
and I just like to blend it out with my
other fingers I'm also gonna put this
just on my Cupid's bow I'm gonna attempt
to find my NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk
we can pop that on the waterline haven't
seen it in a hop in it couldn't find the
next jumbo eye pencil why is that sound
so weird saying jumbo eye pencil so I'm
going to be using the Milani brow and I
highlight I'm just using the matte shade
and we're gonna put this on our
waterline adding a light color to your
waterline just make such a difference
you look so much more weight for
eyeliner Physicians Formula
I could stir I'm using a lot of
Physicians Formula stuff I feel like
right now Holy Grail eyeliner I'm gonna
skip over mascaras because I do the same
thing in every single shadow in this
video so if you want to see the products
I'm using everything is always listed in
the down bar the nail polish color the
necklace the jewelry everything you want
to know is in the box so the eyes and
everything are all done I totally forgot
that I went to Walgreens to get a bunch
of stuff to use in this video how
perfect are these kind of want to just
like frame this I don't think I actually
want to use these lashes I also got the
Maybelline Color elixir lip gloss
Maybelline was 40% off everything so I
figured and now would be the time to try
these haven't used this before haven't
opened
this is in the shade zero seven zero
intoxicating spice these are supposed to
be pretty pigmented so I'm not gonna
apply up stick or line or anything
underneath I just want to see see what's
going on with these it feels like butter
going on your lips feels it's super
smooth and come meet a mirror for this I
could literally sit here and go like
this all day because it feels so freakin
good I'm all about this so far alright
so this is the final look feel like I
didn't really talk about anything going
on in life right now but next shadow
inch moves I guess if you want to see
the first impression on the foundation
I'm wearing right now I'll link that
below for you guys so you can go check
it out if you like this video and you

thumb anyways love you guys thanks for
