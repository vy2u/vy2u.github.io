get ready with me video using the
brand-new Coastal Scents revealed 2
palette I love it I did already doing my
foundation and face makeup because I
wasn't aware that I was going to be
filming but I have a bunch of other
shadowing schmooze get ready with me
videos so if you want to see how I do my
foundation you can watch one of those
videos which I'll link down below or
also check the down bar because all of
the products on my face right now will
be listed down below so if you want to
see how I did my eyes and blue lips then
just keep watching alright so I already
have my face on didn't think I had time
to film today but good news we do so
like promised today I may be doing a I
like using the new revealed 2 palette I
have a whole review on this I am
completely completely in love with it I
think I'm be doing a matte kind of
smokey eye using this because I do want
to do a crazy lip I'm thinking we're
going to use NYX pistachio which I also
have swatches and first impression video
on the next macaron lipsticks so to
serve as a base this is a little bit
random not what I usually use but I
couldn't find an eye primer the other
day so I just plucked this thing on
under my eye shadow and it actually
really helped blend out the eyeshadows
and serve as a base so I've kind of been
liking this as like a I don't really
want to call it a primer because I don't
think it helps with like the longevity
and creasing and things like that but I
really like it to blend out the
eyeshadows and make it more pigmented so
that's just what I've been using so I'm
going to start off by using this like
taupe color and we're going to blend
this in the crease with a fluffy brush
by tightness videos up graduation and
everything will have already probably
past but yesterday was my last college
class ever
/ final ever very surreal feeling I
don't know but I have good news
job prospects are looking up in Seattle
I had an interview the other day that
went really really well so I'm driving
up to Seattle next week but I'm you're
watching this I already went to Seattle
if you want to be
updated on those kind of things follow
my Twitter post a lot of life updates
and good like that I don't want to
do like it just a taupe smokey eye
because we're going to have really crazy
lips and my shirts a little cray today
just feeling bold I literally have a
makeup gasm every time I put on the
matte shades because they're that
amazing the fly situation is out of
 control went to four different
stores the other day to get a freaking
fly trap
not one of them carried it so not really
sure what to do about the fly situation
but it's getting out of control like we
can't even stay in our living room for
more than like ten minutes without
wanting to jump off the balcony and just
do those windshield wiper motions you
know so after we've got that crease
color on I'm going to go in with this
matte shade right here which is like a
super light kind of pink yeah I guess it
looks kind of pink let's put this all
over the lid and then we're going to
blend a deeper color into the outer me I
feel like my fingers apply lid colors
the best you get the best color payoff
and I don't know not really fan of like
lip brushes I always end up just using
my fingers so then I'm going to take
this shade right here which is probably
my favorite shade in the palette it
reminds me of Mac embark and we're just
going to plop this on the outer third of
our eye
so I just like to pack that color on and
then we're going to go in and blend it
out afterwards so don't you worry
definitely had some things of importance
I had to tell you guys this is what
happens when I don't write down so
I'm gonna go back and want to segment
you 40 and blend then I'm going to take
the black shade right here which has a
little bit of sparkle unfortunately
that's the only thing that I'm not
really a fan of in this palette I wish
they just put a good matte black but
what are you gonna do so I'm just
putting this a little bit outside of
where we put that dark brown kind of
embark light color and then blending
this lightly what do you guys think of
this nail polish I can't tell if it's
like out there cool or if it's just like
hideous McDonald's shade yellow let me
know it's by wet and wild
another new like summer limited edition
things okay got a little too much black
but a little excited kind of blend it
instead of keep applying black so I'm
just going to use whatever is left over
on this brush and run it on my bottom
lash line alright so I'm going to use my
favorite liner Physicians Formula I
booster
I can do too crazy of a wing because I
am going to put falsies on so it'll help
dramatize the eye situation all right
wings are done I'm kind of testing out
eyelashes over to wear for graduation so
I think I'm going to use the demi 102's
I've never used the 102's before I'm
kind of looking for something that isn't
too dramatic but still makes my eyes
look you know better than just mascara
indeed new lash glue my cap is ma this
is like surprisingly satisfying to me
like peeling the dried glue out of a lid
Oh God
smallest things in life you know I see
Jorge on the window now I just let it
get tacky for about 30 seconds also I
mentioned these on my Instagram but if
you guys are down for like really good
doll lashes go with these these are
amazing these are by kiss me and at the
zero three lashes success
I just found mints things you do while
you wait for your lashes to dry I like
to line at the band with some liquid
liner just to cover up any of the glue
now we're going to go over it with some
mascara to blend in my real lashes with
these big ones
I like these very natural-looking yeah
liking him and my ring just went
swimming in my coffee okay getting that
later I'm gonna put some when Wild mega
length on my bottom lashes this is my
favorite bottom mascara because the
bristles are just super tiny alright so
we got our eyes done for lips I'm going
to start by lining with this la girl
super hard to read with the help
glide gel liner this is actually an eye
liner but we're using on our lips it's a
blue color and I'm going to go in with
NYX pistachio
we can almost just go with this color
but we're going all the way I'm using
NYX pistachio woohoo
that created a cool pillar Hills the app
be like a mermaid
there we go if you liked this shadow
inch mousse get ready with me video
using the new revealed 2 palette be sure
to give it a thumbs up so I know let me
know down below your favorite blue
lipsticks are because really feeling
