get ready with me video on the look I'm
wearing right now obviously use some
stuff I haven't used in a while or ever
use the Anarchy Urban Decay palette um
new glaze lip paints also I forgot to
mention it but I did already primed my
face with my baby benefit Porefessional
and I finished off with Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray also my child so
if you wanna hear me talk for myself and
get ready then just keep watching
alright so I'm having a pretty good skin
day today so I think I'm just gonna go
with Ready Set gorgeous and mix it in
with my Manic Panic
dream down the love of my life I took a
sleeping pill last night and this
morning I had like four cups of coffee
so I'm feeling a little bit interesting
right now this is gonna be a fun video
so I'm just putting a little bit of
Ready Set gorgeous on the back of my
hand and then mixing in dreamtone to
lighten it up and I just put like two
pumps of dreamtone in there this
foundation is probably like five shades
too dark for me I don't know why they
made Katy Perry look like pale princess
and then they made the lightest shade
like an NC 30 so to blend this in I'm
using my Sigma f80 flat top kabuki I've
talked about this foundation Lots before
but basically just gives you the
prettiest like natural looking finish
but it still gives you good coverage my
kind of foundation so I have a lot to
talk to you guys about in this video
where do I begin I'm going to be
answering some of your questions from
previous shadow in shmooze videos thank
you to everyone who commented on the
Milani video I asked you guys to comment
what you're doing with your lives
because I like knowing about you guys
rather than just you know me talking to
a camera I like putting like visuals you
know and a lot of freaking people
commented so it's really fun reading all
of your comments so I'll link that video
over here if you guys want to go see
that if you haven't seen it yet there
are some very motivational and inspiring
women that watch my video so that was
really close e we're tying back the hair
I hope I shaved my armpits we're in the
clear
so here's my face with one layer
Ready Set gorgeous on and dreamtone then
I like to give it a little more coverage
and brighten up the under eyes with my
go-to concealers I mentioned these in my
May raves and rejects but I've literally
been using these every single day shout
out to all the people who told me that
you can actually remove the sponge I
will be removing that so I just mix in a
little bit of my NYX lavender concealer
helps to lighten it up so then I just
slop this under the eyes and apparently
the eye lashes
you can see the difference between no
concealer and concealer I actually look
like an awake human being now I still
can't get the damn fly out of my room so
if you see it buzzing around I feel like
we should just embrace him and name him
and he can like be my pet what should we
name him I'm thinking Jorge but Jorge
was my fish his name don't know if I can
really do that is that like against pet
protocol
Jorge also died then I just run whatever
is left down the bridge of my nose a
little bit on my forehead chin if you
use your hands for a lot of products
like I do for mixing em I always just
keep a pack of wipes in my drawer I just
use like the Rite Aid brand at baby
wipes and they're also just good to have
to like clean up your makeup station
afterwards what the hell is going on
it's not the trash man they do this
every day at like 8:00 a.m. to set my
under eye like always I'm using my
physician's formula correcting powder
someone commented on one of my last
videos and asked since it's a correcting
powder they're kind of confused about
how to wear it I just wear it however I
feel like wearing it it is light enough
for my skin so I could technically put
this all over but I feel like that kind
of washes me out a little bit so I just
like to use it for my under-eye to
lighten it up and then other areas of my
face that I highlighted but if you have
skin that is better than mine you could
for sure use this all over don't be
scared just because it says correcting
powder
so my favorite powder which I actually
forgot to include in my May raves and
rejects I don't know how I forgot it but
it's the laura geller balance and brian
powder in porcelain this is probably the
best powder I have ever used if you like
a matte finish you won't like this it
definitely is like a satin finish but it
looks really natural on the skin I don't
get oily throughout the day it just sets
my makeup really nicely and it is
totally worth the price tag I will be
for sure repurchasing this if you
haven't tried this I will link it down
below and I would HIGHLY highly
recommend you getting it because it is
amazing combing through the brands if
you want to know how I do my brows I
have a whole brown tutorial that you can
watch so I will be right back
got my brows on are we straight I think
so so for blush I'm going to go with
Tarte Dollface I haven't used this in a
while a couple years ago if you've
watched my videos then this used to be
like my go-to everyday favorite blush
just gives you a really pretty pink
flush and I'm not using my usual morphe
brush that I used to apply it because
it's not nearly as pigmented as my wet
and wild one which can s actually be
nicer in a blush because then it's
easier to blend and it's not as
difficult to work with ooh yeah like
this I'm just using the elf complexion
brush to apply this bad boy all I'm
doing today is I have a phone interview
with a company and then I have a final
exam that I haven't started studying for
go to the library and write a paper that
I haven't started do tomorrow so can you
tell it's senior year so there we have
it
I like this blush not too much you know
I can apply some lip cyl lip balm stuff
is amazing I like it because it feels
more waxy than greasy I hate chap sticks
that feel like they're just gonna like
rub off your lips in two seconds
kinda smells like mint I'm gonna prime
my eyes with the hard candy eyeshadow
primer you can get this at Walmart for
like five dollars and it's pretty good
Jorge you need to calm down guys what is
my life coming down to I'm talking to
apply right now what else is new oh yeah
so I've been thinking a lot lately
about that made it sound really serious
I'm really just talking about lighting
I've been thinking about getting the
diva ring light comment down below and
let me know if any of you have it and
what you think about it I know it's
pretty pricey but my birthday's coming
up it's June 11th turning 22 and I was
thinking about asking it for my birthday
but the other thing with that is that I
don't know where I'm going to be in
literally 15 days we'll be moving to San
Francisco or to Seattle kind of up in
the air along with the whole drop
situation right now I went to Seattle
last weekend which you knew if you
follow my Twitter which is the Tayla
kind of really like fell in love with it
such an awesome city so much to do but
it doesn't feel like a super
overwhelming big city so I'm really
hoping that the job situation works out
there or in San Francisco you just never
know so I'm just fussing with the NYX
matte eyeshadow and brick right now
spending a little bit in the cap just to
even it out this is pretty much a dupe
for Mac Brown script I love this color
it's amazing it's blending this in the
crease and I think for the rest of the
eyes we're going to use the Urban Decay
Anarchy palette because I ordered this a
while ago and look at the packaging so
cute I worded this a while ago and I
like have used it one time so we're
using it today I can't go too intense
because I'm going on campus I mean I
guess I could go intense why not what
else oh yeah I wanted to address the
fact that people are saying that I don't
smile in my videos you guys I have this
thing where I cannot smile well I'm
moving my mouth talking is this weird
condition I don't know what it's called
but I have it and instead of like
sitting here trying to smile while I
talk and whatever it's sorry but that's
not me that's not how I talk I wish I
could look really happy when I was
talking that would be nice because it
wouldn't have like chronic bitch face
but I just can't I smile a lot in real
life I laugh a lot in real life but you
guys don't see that because when you're
talking to yourself in a room it's you
know unless I make myself laugh so yeah
sorry I'll smile when I can i Sigma e-40
is missing
Oh found it seriously I've been looking
for that for like three days so I'm use
my Sigma e-40 just to blend out all of
those lines this is like literally the
best brush ever invented for blending I
just do like circular and then
windshield wiper motions you know what
else did I have to talk about I made a
list of the stuff that you guys asked me
to talk about so just going off of that
someone asked what my natural hair color
is my natural hair color is strawberry
blonde I don't even remember what it
looks like because I've had a black
since like eighth grade I feel like this
is my natural hair color it's not but
that's what I tell myself so then I'm
going in with the Anarchy palette and
one of the only shades that I've used in
this is this guy right here and it is
this gorgeous like muted a pink kind of
taupey color if I can find my brush
can't find a brush so we're just going
in with this little angled thing
actually the brush I'm gonna use my
finger plays better anyway like look at
how beautiful that color is I don't even
know if you guys can tell on camera but
it's like the perfect perfect matte
shade I'm going to go back in with Sigma
e-40 and blend normally I would add
another color in the outer V or
something right now but since I am going
on campus I just going to keep it basic
I'm going to take that same color and
run it along my bottom lash line then
I'm going to use this bottom thing which
is so freakin hard to open it's like a
workout trying to get open that's why I
never go for this palette because it's
such a pain in the ass to get open
seriously hallelujah finally got it open
and I just dented the blush and it's all
over my shirt so there's a couple
blushes in here and a highlight I think
I'm just gonna use this highlight for my
what oh just blush on my finger use this
highlight for my inner corner this is
pretty subtle every time I put on that
lip color I forget how much I love it I
don't know why I don't wear that every
day cuz you need to switch up your
makeup Taylor you have way too much so
the winged liner I'm going to be using
is my positions formula eye booster
which I need to get another one it's
usually a lot more black than is going
to show up but
need to make a trip to Rite Aid so just
make a base like that and then kind of
create this wing I'm going to take some
of that same elf eyeshadow and put that
on my bottom lash line and you only want
to put this on like the outer third of
your eye or else you're going to be
looking a little bit raccoony biome so
four mascaras I'm going to be using the
usual Mac prep and prime Maybelline
falsies and then wet and wild make a
length on the bottom which I really need
to get a new one this is kind of
disgusting it's like completely rubbed
off but still works I will be back ended
up using L'Oreal carbon black first and
now I'm going to go over with falsies
because I don't know I felt like it
okay so eyes are done for lips I'm going
to be using the girls glazed lip I got a
package
so anyways today we're going to be using
the glazed lip paint from la girl these
are brand new they sent me all six to
try out go comment down below if you
guys want to see like a review swatches
Tryon video wearing these guys I've
tried a few of them out so far and I do
really like them they're super pigmented
the only thing is it's very difficult to
apply because you can see the applicator
and they are super pigmented so it's a
little tricky to apply today I'm using a
blushing and it's like a really pretty
mock color that you'll see in a second
so I'm going to be using a lip brush
because it's kind of impossible to get a
clear cut line
pretty sure my lip brush still has black
cat in it yep we're getting a kind of
hombre lip right now so there we go I
love the color very difficult to apply
they do have a minty scent to it which I
really like that everything I feel like
that went by really fast
got a lot of fourth day hair the only
time I get volume though so here is the
final look and it's all already all over
my teeth if you guys like shout and

video a thumbs up so I know comment down
below if you have any questions or get
ready with me topics that you want to be
addressed in the next video and we can
