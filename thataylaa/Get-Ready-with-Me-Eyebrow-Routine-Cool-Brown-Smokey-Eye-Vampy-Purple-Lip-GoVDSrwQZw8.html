schmooze I'm looking wearing right now
I completely forgot to film an intro for
this video so here we are if you want to
see flip you're in the right place
just keep watching you get to see up
close and personal planets happening on
my face right now so we're gonna do the
brows
I've been shown how I do my brows in the
video in a while but I wanted to because
I feel like it's changed since the last
time so I'm going to take the UH
nostalgia dip brow pomade in dark brown
and the shade granite and my InFocus who
knows the brush that I use for my
eyebrows is just this mini Ecotools
brush I got this probably a year and a
half ago and it's like my go-to I grab
brush lately I've just been using dark
brown on the front part of my brows and
then I go in with granite on the tail
and I do it pretty messy and then I
clean up and kind of shave it with
concealer which I never used to do but I
find that that really helps to shape the
brows so they're probably gonna look a
little cray for a couple minutes and
then it'll be fine let me know if you
guys would want a whole eyebrow tutorial
yeah a girlfriend now I'm going in with
granite
then I'm gonna go in with my NARS
radiant creamy concealer but I'm using
the shade vanilla which is a shade up
from Chantilly I feel like when I use
Chantilly it's just too bright the brush
I like to use to carve them out is the
evening eleven brush by Sedona lace does
the background really dark right now you
just got to coat it on there
so then on the days that I feel like it
I've been using the ico brow gel I can
find it here we go this is the ICO
London brow gel shape and define I'm
gonna get like alright we got more like
was it talking about I haven't used too
many brow gels in my time so I don't
really know how this compares but I like
it because it has a small wand and this
is half a color I don't know if you'll
spend a weird and like cooling hope I'm
in focus right now this is the last or
second class video that I'll be using
this camera for I did order the Canon
t5i which autofocus got way too much
primer I didn't order the Canon t5i
which autofocuses so I'm freaking
thrilled with the lens I use I can't
reach my camera right now so I can't
focus it or manually focus it on my face
and when you're doing makeup stuff and
like showing products it's just best to
have an autofocus camera because the
amount of time that you save is unreal
so it's something that's worth it to me
I just put max prep and prime or not
know what did I just put painterly
paint-pot on my eye goals so I actually
have no idea what we're doing on the ice
today I want to do like a deep brown
smokey eye but I've no idea what we're
gonna use to it I think I might use the
lorac Pro palette because I've not done
a look with that in a while so mine is
pretty destroyed I'm going to take the
shade taupe on my favorite sit only CV
13 blending brush and just plop this in
the crease what's up with you guys how's
life I want to talk about the fact that
I changed my outro because I was getting
a lot of comments about your favorite
song being on I apologize for it's also
my favorite song but it's kind of out of
my control I don't want to have any
copyright issues with it also changed my
intro song which sucks because I love it
the outro song is different which if you
watch my whole video you know alright I
don't know if I want to do a Matt I know
this is really pretty
ok I'm going to take the shade deluxe by
colour-pop cosmetics and it's like this
deep bronze II have a new medic I'm
gonna do Matt I so I'm gonna take the
shade expresso from the LA profile
this is just a deep brown color with
this ship time to fill up and we're just
gonna pop this on the lid all right so
I'm gonna go in with my Pantone Sephora
Col a color palette I'm a little review
on this palette if you want to see that
I haven't used this since that review so
I feel like I should get on that I'm
going to take this warm brown shade
called hot chocolate on the same
blending brush and we're just going to
go over that to blend into the crease
Hellyeah this color is so pretty this
feels like super buttery well here it's
great I'm going to take this like big
powder brush with the shade cream from
the warm pro we're just going to take
that to blend out this a little bit it's
a good trick if you think he'd go over
like - hi I'm to your brow bone just
take a cream color blend it out I'm also
taking a tiny bit of white and just
putting that under the earth
bumper out I think I'm gonna take this
like red shade and just see what happens
this is a shade marsala I was gonna take
it on my finger and put this in the
center of my eye
wow that's full-on red not really
feeling that I think I'm gonna trying
white box as much of that as I can and
just start again let me go back in with
expresso and just Pat that over top I
think expressing this dark enough that
it'll cover it up so I'm going with
expresso on the other eye just because
that deepened everything up a little bit
Roza blurry right now I'm going to take
the shade russet on a Sedona lace Evo 9
brush we're going to put this directly
into the crease so I'm going to take
that same brush and take shifting sand
we're gonna have some left over from
that last shades it'll probably be
darker
but I'm just gonna run this on the
bottom that she was really pretty
alright now I'm going to take the shade
lalala by colour-pop cosmetics I'm take
my finger we're gonna put this on the
bottom lashline this is like a really
pretty rose Goldy color I just kinda
putting this on the middle of my eyes
I'm gonna take the shade XO by color pot
I'm going to take expresso and just
blend that on the bottom lash line just
on the outer third alright where are you
Brown eyeliner so on the waterline I'm
gonna use this brown eyeliner from
Sephora I think it's just their brand
that hurts and it's not coming off I'm
gonna tried the stubborn brown pencil by
Mac instead and awesome this is also not
sharpened
I think sharpening eyeliner is like
right up there with folding sheets on
the list of things that I hate in the
world whose folding laundry in general
is like the most pointless thing on
planet Earth
I'm gonna try out this Milani eyeliner
this is brown oil and this is the brush
i've been using for gel eyeliner and i
love it so i haven't tried the actual
eyeliner of this yet not dark enough to
go on top of this eyeshadow because you
can't really see it but it is giving it
like a nice kind of wet foiled look
which I actually really like I think I'm
gonna use a different eyeliner to do the
wing because I feel like you just won't
be able to see it then I'm going to take
my normal Physicians Formula i booster
for the wing okay so I'm gonna go back
in with that brown eyeliner on the
waterline and we're just gonna put a
little bit of this on the bottom lash
line just on the outer third we want the
bottom lash line to be even more smudged
out I'm gonna go in with expresso and
then blend it out like I've used
expressively 25 times so I'm just gonna
go in with falsies I think I'm gonna use
these I Nimmo these are super dramatic
this is number glam 12 and these look
super pretty don't you try it out I just
realized we did something really smart
instead of putting the sticky adhesive
all the way across the bands when you
pull it off it kind of like demesne the
shape of the eyelash they only put it on
the front and end of the lash so that it
just comes right off and it actually
like stays the curved shape so that's
actually really cool I think I have a
coupon code for you guys I just realized
I think it's ten percent off I don't
know I leave it down below but I do have
a coupon for you guys if you guys want
to check out I'm you know
alright so falsies are on I'm completely
in love with these they look really nice
and full kind of like mink lashes I
didn't even know what these are are
these new clashes so I'm just going to
apply my wet mild make a length mascara
to the bottom lashes I think these might
be my new favorite lashes the eyes are
finished I want to do like a deep
purpley lip so I'm going with the makeup
revolution salvation velvet Locker in
the shade velvet vamp I've only used
this one time before I think I actually
posted a picture on Instagram and I
really
I don't know how long lasting these are
but they're really nice pigmented liquid
lipsticks I'm not thinking to use a lip
liner I think we're just gonna go for it
but there's a new trend where you only
do the bottom or top lip just restart it
I'm gonna kind of let that dry and then
do a second layer of it just to make it
super opaque lipstick is always the
hardest part for me just because my lips
are so naturally not like symmetrical at
all it feels pretty dry and sticky all
right so I feel like that layers really
well all right so this is the final look
I hope you guys liked it if you did give
it a thumbs up so I know I am gonna be
having like a full face shadow inch
waves coming soon and now I haven't had
one of those in a while I've been
testing out a bunch of different
foundations so that's mostly why if you
want to know what's on my face right now
I'll leave it in a blog post which will
be linked down below I kind of like
doing it that way because then you can
see more photos and stuff as well not
just like a video comment down below
with any kind of looks or products that
you want to see in the next shadow inch
mousse and we can do that love you guys
thanks for watching and see you my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
