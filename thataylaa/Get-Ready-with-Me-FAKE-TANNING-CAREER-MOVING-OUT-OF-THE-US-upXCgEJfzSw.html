today we have a shadowing schmooze on
look I'm wearing right now I used a
bunch of new products in this video
actually besides my face makeup I think
I used all new products trying out this
chocolate bar palette from makeup
revolution got some new color pop stuff
and glam bought stuff so if you want to
see how I got this look you're in the
right place just keep watching all right
so I just spent literally an hour trying
to get my camera to work change to my
old lenses I was having major
technological issues so sorry if I'm not
completely in focus one of those days it
literally cannot tell it all of them in
size right now
alright so I've already done my face in
my brows obviously I used the L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte foundation and I
don't use this like on a daily basis in
real life but I feel like it looks
really well on camera especially paired
with the Maybelline blur and illuminate
primer I feel like these two on camera
just look really good I don't know what
it is about it so I have a whole box of
new makeup that I'm going to try out on
this video super excited because I feel
like I haven't sat down and done shadow
and cheese in a while life has been kind
of crazy lately with work so I'm excited
just schmoozed and talked about makeup
and things going on this is gonna be
kind of a Q&amp;amp;A video so if you're not
following my Instagram you should
because you can do fun things like this
asked you guys on Instagram to send me
over some questions and I have a bunch
of them so I'm gonna try and get through
as many as again so we're getting a
bunch of stuff from makeup revolution on
my brows today is the awesome dual brow
art pin shape in the shade darkest it is
pretty freakin dark I do like the way it
looked it was a little bit let me just
show you it wait what woah okay I
definitely didn't notice this and this
is like a felt-tip and I didn't even
know that was a thing I guess that's why
it's called dual brow cuz I say it's
hard to get a fine point because the way
with this like retractable end is shaped
it's kind of just like circle shaped so
I didn't have to go in with lot of
concealer to shape them but dang I wish
I knew about this side okay this looks
like a legit black eyeliner like
this is literally black guys can see
that for concealer I'm going to use the
Maybelline master conceal I posted a
picture I think on Instagram of this
this isn't the shade ten fair it's the
lightest shade I've been using this
every day for the last probably week and
a half and I think it's a decent
concealer it does kind of crease so if
you already have a problem with creasing
I wouldn't recommend this it has good
coverage and I do like the shade it
definitely has a lot of yellow tones
going on the thing I don't like about
the infallible Pro matte is that it's a
little bit difficult to blend stuff on
top of it everyone I'm kind of using
this every day for work when I don't
really care I'm not why I put my right
side I feel like never covers as well
I'm just gonna go for a little bit more
right in the inner part sentences are so
hard sometimes I'm also gonna take tiny
it for this on the center of my chin and
my forehead just to brighten everything
up this just does not blend well over
this fashion looking a little patchy and
cakey interesting it's so like always
I'm gonna go in with my positions
formula correcting powder and instead of
using my like huge Ecotools brush I
usually use I've been going in with this
six plus like dome tapered brush I know
that it's Sedona likes and Sigma make
one like exactly like this a six plus
brushes are from eBay they do shed but
for the price they're like decent
quality since this is a super light
powder and just gonna use some on the
parts of my face they don't want to
highlight if you want to see a full
highlight contour video I have that I'll
link it down below great maybe we should
make Sur some question so I'm just gonna
start at the top if you had to go to a
deserted island for a year what three
products would you take with you I don't
think I would survive when the deserted
island three years but if I did I would
take Foundation for sure probably like a
brow pencil and then mascara no I don't
really care about mascara foundation
would have SPF so we're covered there
but also turn into a freaking Lobster no
no I feel like all I really need is
Foundation and brow stuff if I had good
skin I feel
more makeup like ever maybe blush so I
don't look completely Casper asked
customers okay so I'm going with the
Tarte smooth operator powder this is a
mini version from glam bought I think I
mentioned glambot in my last video or
last new second-to-last video I'll leave
them down below they're basically a site
where you can buy high-end use makeup
for cheaper it's awesome and I'm
obsessed with it if I can figure out how
to get this open also they had a 40% off
all eye makeup say all the other day and
I went a little gray this is addressing
there's literally two cools on this
thing I've been kind of feeling the
translucent setting powders lately I
have no idea why we're going with my
Real Techniques blush brush which I
never have used for blush ever
and let's just powder up this foundation
is like already is sets to a powder
finish that you really don't need a
powder I just like it because it's
easier to blend blush and bronzer on top
of it I'm supposed to be a brunch in
like 30 minutes this is gonna be fun
feels really soft oh my forehead feels
like a baby's butt alright question
number two it's like a lot to think
about at the same time if you could
change one thing about yourself what
would it be
I would probably wish that I had the
ability to be a good public speaker I
think that's something that's like so
useful in life and they always tell you
that in college and high school and
stuff but it really is I never realized
the amount of public speaking I would
have to do after college it's just a
good skill to have that I'm horrible at
I do not like to be the center of
attention at all so that's like my
biggest fear so for blush and bronzer or
I guess this isn't technically a bronzer
but I mean you say as a bronzer
colour-pop cosmetics came out with new
duper shot cheeks and they're basically
blushes and they look so frickin
beautiful cuz that's what their
eyeshadows so when they sent me these I
was stoked
there's 4.2 grams of product in here
which I feel like is a lot so I'm using
the shade between the sheets as kind of
like a bronzer it's definitely like a
darker for me it could be just give me
some definition I've never used these
before so I don't know how
I'm here they're kind of like a weird
cream okay so this definitely looks like
a blush on it looks a lot darker in the
pan I feel like it feels weird like when
you dip your brush in it just kind of
turns into like a creamy thing but it
doesn't feel like the cream at all when
you blend it on your face so then for
blush I'm gonna use this shade cleanup I
did swatch this and it looks so freakin
pretty this is like the prettiest like
pinky purple shade ooh this definitely
has some shine going on yeah this one's
a satin finish and the other one was a
matte finish this is gorgeous
did I answer that question yeah are you
going to be doing mail opening videos so
I don't think I've mentioned it on my
channel I've mentioned on Instagram a
few times but I did get a p.o box I
wasn't planning on doing like an
announcement thing because I don't think
it's stuffing the deal and I don't
really want you guys to feel the need to
like send me stuff it's more for
companies and for privacy reasons I did
get a peel box so if you want to write
letters that would be awesome I love
reading your guys letters I've bought in
a few and it's been like so cool thank
you to everyone who's written so far but
so now I'm not gonna be doing mail
opening videos at least not yet I just I
don't know if they just like rubbed me
the wrong way but I do post pictures of
like the letters and stuff you guys send
me on Instagram how long are you in
Seattle for um that's a great question I
live here now so I'm not really sure how
long I love Seattle so far and I love my
job so I don't see myself moving anytime
soon I am obsessed with this blush
though didn't we see this I think for a
highlight and we go in with your
minerals Sweden Swedish winter I think I
got this in my Ipsy you know some one of
those boxes this is definitely a mineral
eyeshadow but I find that sometimes the
mineral like pearly white eye shadows
are really good for fair skin I'm gonna
go back in with that tapered brush that
we used under the eyes let's just hope
that this isn't oh this is sparkly
we'll go in with powder and when it turn
it down
well usually spray my setting spray
before I get my makeup I don't know why
what is your career besides YouTube I
work in marketing on a company it is a
full-time job I usually work more than
40 hours a week and then I do YouTube as
my second job so I literally have like
zero free time I consider YouTube a
hobby so I don't like to think of that
as work but it has turned into like a
full time drop for me as well which is
awesome but it is a ton of work so
I basically film and edit all of my
videos on the weekend and then schedule
em to go up throughout the week but I
love doing it it's a choice I love
talking to you guys and making videos so
I wouldn't ever not do that choose one
burritos or makeup that is probably the
most difficult question on planet earth
and I'm gonna have to go with burritos
then I'm gonna go in with this primary
oh there's two in here this is one of
the free gifts that glambot sent and you
produce a certain amount I think they
send out little sample size products
which is really awesome so we try out
the Too Faced shadow insurance in the
shade candle light looks like this is an
illuminating eyeprimer
ladies it looks kind of ashy which is
fine because they're gonna be applying
eyeshadow on top of it but it definitely
is going on patchy I don't know if you
guys can see that have you ever tried
fake tanning if so how did it turn out
would you ever do it again
so if you've watched my channel for a
while you know that I used to be an avid
self tanner eyes only my left eye
watering I used to hate my pale skin I
don't think I'll ever go back to self
tanning I have learned to embrace my
pale skin and I actually prefer it to
when my skin is self tan their fake tans
whatever if you want to hear my thoughts
and that I have a whole how to love your
pale skin video I'm going in with the
color pop cosmetics selfie eyeshadow
this is part of the Shannon XO
collection and I'm freaking obsessed
with it it's a perfect perfect crease
color good job Shannon and a blending
brush my favorite evey 13 my sit on lace
how many times have I said Sigma lace
we're going in with the 9:04 brush
we're gonna put this on the bottom
lashline then we're gonna go in with
this palette which I've not tried yet so
I love makeup naked chocolate palette
get out of there this is from makeup
revolution which I mentioned a few times
on Instagram and on my channel I think
kind of obsessed with them I feel like I
place an order like every week they
basically have a lot of cheap dupes for
high-end makeup and I'm pretty sure this
is supposed to kind of mimic the YouTube
Faced chocolate bar palette there's a
huge a smear on here looks like there's
a good mix of shimmer and matte shadows
if you could retire tomorrow what would
you do I would definitely go travel easy
what is the weirdest compliment you've
ever gotten one time I was walking
around in Palm Springs and this guy in a
mall came up to me and said that I have
nice feet which is weird on multiple
levels because I literally have like
midget sized feet I'm a size four and
shoes love life crushed someone special
just me myself and I over here at the
moment phone the Twitter you hear all of
my OkCupid and tinder date stories right
let's do some makeup I'm going to take
this like it looks like a deep rosy gold
color
this looks pretty and we're gonna put
this on one this is the second one over
right here hello yeah feels super nice
and buttery this is an interesting
question when you were younger you said
that you do not want to live permanently
in the United States and you preferred
the culture of other countries now that
you're older and established in Seattle
do you feel that that has changed I'm
interested to see how growing older has
shaped your view on the topic so if
you've watched my videos for a while so
thinking to geralyn CH vez you've
clearly been watching my videos for a
longest time let me just figure out what
I'm doing this shade is like one of my
favorite kind of all-time shades this
looks like Mac embark and the reveal to
follow my favorite shade from there I'm
one that's without was super powdery
yeah so if you've been watching my
channel for a while you know that I
planning on not living in the u.s. after
graduation and moving abroad somewhere I
did live in the Middle East for a while
I still definitely see myself living
outside of the US if I go to grad school
which I probably will I definitely want
to go to either Canada or London or
somewhere in Europe just because it's
cheaper and why not I just like the
experience of like being in a new
culture in a new place I feel like I get
bored when I'm in the same place for a
while so it'll be interesting to see how
long they stay in Seattle and so on said
you miss being in Jordan do you stay in
touch with the family you love doing
I do miss being in Jordan I feel like
the last few months I've like really
started to miss it because it's been
like it's been over a year now which is
so crazy to me my first one was such a
unique woman and she was just like
incredible I still do Skype with them
and whatsapp like chat with them they're
just kind of slightly blending that
shade into the crease there's gonna take
whatever's left over on the brush and
blend it into the bottom lashline I'm
gonna go in with the makeup revolution
this is a waterproof liquid eyeliner I'm
super excited to try out because the
brush looks really nice it's like a
super slim but felt to air what is this
doesn't look like fill I don't know what
it is I haven't not used my Physicians
Formula
eyeliner in a while besides my last
benefit fail I like that over here if
you didn't see that if you want to see
my honest thoughts on the benefit
they're real
I remember seeing a post a little bit
back you bought African black so how's
it doing for you so I have been using
the african black soap every day and I
really
like it I think it has helped to clear
up my channel I will keep you guys
updated on that sorry there's like no
way I can talk and do eyeliner at the
same code this is super black it's
interesting it's a very like curved
brush I don't know if you guys can see
that where's the white spot there it's
very curved alright that's actually
pretty easy it is pretty wet like you
can see it's still not dries I did just
try to go over it and it kind of wiped
off but I had you might have to wait for
it to fully dry for falsies I think
we're just gonna use my favorite kiss me
0-3 lashes you can get these up in eBay
what they look like energized kiss lash
adhesive I haven't used this yet let me
post this on Instagram some you said it
was like really intense like your lashes
aren't going anywhere it's an
interesting silicone brush this is like
probably the easiest applicator I've
ever used on the lash glue so I'm just
going to go over with some mascara my
favorite mascara has been the Maybelline
lash sensational this stuff is amazing
like there's illogically where it
shouldn't be alright so for bottom
mascara I'm just gonna using wet n Wild
mega length my go-to on mascara the
brush on this is just perfect for
getting in your bottom lash line because
it's so tiny go for lips I got the elf
matte lip color and T rose a couple
years ago I used to always use this and
I think I just lost it this is like
three dollars I want to say I think you
can get these at Target I don't know how
I feel about this lip color with this
eye because I feel like the eyes are
very warm tone and this is like pretty
cool tone I think I'm actually gonna
scratch that I posted a picture on
Instagram with this exact combination
but I've been freaking obsessed with it
this is the Rimmel exaggerate lip liner
in 45 epic and then mixed with the new
Milani matte naked lipstick I've been
wearing
every single day and work and about a
few compliments on it it's like the
perfect perfect dark ish matte shade I'm
gonna put the Milani on on pot alright
so the last thing I'm gonna do is go
back in with the chocolate palette thing
I'm going to take the lightest shimmery
like champagne color right here and just
pop this on the inner corner alright so
this is the final look if you guys like
this video and you like shadow and
schmooze videos go ahead and give it a
thumbs up so I know if you have any
questions that you want me to answer in
my next shadow interviews make sure you
follow my instagram love you guys thanks
for watching and see you my next video
