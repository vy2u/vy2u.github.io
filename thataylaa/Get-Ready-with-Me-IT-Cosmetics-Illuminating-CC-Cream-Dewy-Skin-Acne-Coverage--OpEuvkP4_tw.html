schmooze on the look I'm wearing right
now
that's very enthusiastic feels good to
be sitting down and filming again
actually took a little vacation which
was weird
just to be super transparent with you
guys like always this video is sponsored
by a cosmetics I was lucky enough to
team up with the lovely folks there who
sent me a giant box of goodies to try
out for you guys one of them you'll
actually see in my raves and rejects
video which will be up after this some
of the stuff I'm going to use in this
video I'm trying out for the first time
and a few of the products I've been
using for a few weeks now just so I can
give you my full thoughts on them like
always my thoughts are a hundred percent
my own it's what I'm thinking so let's
do this if you want to see how I got
this look you're in the right place just
keep watching feeling kind of 90s right
now with the leopard and the hoop
earrings but oh dry shampoo patch lovely
alright so I just got back from work my
eyes are super bloodshot right now I
just put in eyedrops so happens when you
stare at a computer for nine hours
so we're filming we're doing this it is
literally like Alaska in my room rang
out leopard robe I have no idea what
kind of look we're gonna do right now
we're just gonna play with some products
and see how they are my April raisin
rejects video will actually be up after
this so supposed to go up before this
that's not happening in that video I
mentioned my favorite combination for
foundation this month this is it this is
a hard candy glamoflauge foundation in
the lightest shade porcelain and then
the it cosmetics CC illumination BB
cream so that's what I'm be doing on my
face today so you can see how they look
I realized literally as I was getting
ready for this video that I've been
using not the lightest shade in the BB
cream which is probably why it was super
dark on me they actually have a shade
called fair so I'm going to be mixing
this with the foundation today so we can
see how it looks actually they might try
fair on one side of my face first just
by itself it does have pretty freakin
good coverage fair actually looks pretty
light so to apply I'm going to be using
the heavenly luxe flattop buffing
foundation brush if you have ever been
in Ulta and felt it cosmetics brushes
they are literally the softest thing on
planet Earth
I've tried out a couple of them already
and it feels like you're rubbing like I
don't even know what what's really soft
so just reading off of their website
this is supposed to be a one step seven
in one anti-aging serum dark spot
corrector brightening color corrector
full coverage foundation and it has SPF
50 which is really awesome
if you're a pale princess or actually
anyone should be wearing SPF in their
foundation so I'm just going to put some
of this on my pallet we're just going to
go to town I'm gonna start on this side
and do a before and after actually maybe
we should do this side so you can see
how much it covers oh yeah light is way
lighter than her fair is way lighter
than light it has a pretty heavy scent
smells like a spa it smells good I've
been using that foundation combination
for a few weeks now and it hasn't broken
me out all right so you can see this was
one layer I'm going to turn down the
brightness for a second so you can
really see pretty decent coverage I love
how illuminating this is it looks
beautiful mixed in with the hard candy
foundation which we'll do I don't know
if I should do a full layer of this all
over and then go in with weird about
disco I was gonna mix a little bit of
this with my hard candy like I normally
do hard candy foundation is full
coverage and it's super super pale so
you just need a tiny squirt of this this
brush feels so quick and nice I also got
a little sunburned in New Orleans so any
face products that I put on right now
just look super yellow compared to my
body tell me how one wears 50 SPF
outside and still get sunburned my
eyebrows are a little out of control
right now plucking eyebrows really
hasn't been at the top of the priority
list look at this freakin illumination
if you like dewy skin this is beautiful
we have our base on I'm gonna go in with
this CC plus full coverage correcting
eye cream this is basically a concealer
this also has SPF 50 which I thought was
cool and is supposed to be an anti-aging
hydrating serum I tried this out for the
first time this morning and the shade is
doable for me if you have pale skin it
can work but I also like to put a little
bit of the Naked skin concealer over top
to lighten it up I want to show you guys
just the coverage and stuff of the
it feels like super moisturizing when it
goes on your skin I just say words for
the first time today I literally can't
remember if I just said I wear this for
the first time today this morning and I
didn't have any problems with it
creasing or anything throughout the day
actually don't think we need the urban
decay on top looks pretty good and I
think when we put the Physicians Formula
powder on top we'll be good to go I
totally forgot to mention I primed my
face with the L'Oreal Revitalift miracle
blur this feels kind of funky it kind of
feels like I don't even know the
consistency like a paste or something it
kind of feels like modge podge but on
your face this is the all-over and
conceal brush this duo thing I'm going
to take this with my Physicians Formula
powder to set the under eyes I'm also
going to put a tiny bit of this just in
the center of my forehead so to set
everything I'm going to try out this by
by pours poreless finish micro powder
this is in the shade translucent it
looks like it's supposed to basically
make your pores disappear absorb oil and
shine instantly blurs the look of pores
sooo sleek packaging it looks like it
has a little tiny yellow tint to it I'm
going to use this brush which is freakin
heavenly I could just like sit here and
go like this for my entire life but
we're not going to do that Taylor I just
got a little bit of it in the cap I'm
going to swirl it around
well that's line everywhere we're just
going to set everything
try not to inhale it I love how the CC
cream even after you said it you can
still see the illumination peeking
through I definitely need to set my face
with that foundation combination I've
been using and what I normally use is
the ëcause medic celebration foundation
illumination in the shade fair well I
don't think I ever did a whole review on
this but I definitely did a shadow inch
mousse mentioning this like six months
ago or eight months ago will link that
down below if you haven't seen that but
I kind of refill in love with this thing
this has been my go-to powder gives you
such a pretty glow and it doesn't look
like you're wearing powder at all for
bronzer and everything I think there's a
highlighter in here to live laugh love
vitality face disc this thing is freakin
huge check the size of my face so we're
just gonna get a little contour going as
you can see this is definitely more of a
warm kind of bronzer color I'm gonna go
in with the highlight in here I've kind
of been enjoying doing highlight first
and then blush I don't know sometimes it
just like blends better I feel like I
know how intense this is so oh hell yeah
it looks like that has a tiny bit of
like champagne e pink in there now we're
gonna go in with the blush in here ooh I
really like that that reminds me of the
wet and wild salmon pink or something
I'm all about that blush let's see what
this brow powder is all about Universal
brow pencil with active brow enhancing
technology what shade is this Oh
Universal I feel like we should like
talk about life right now I just got
back from New Orleans literally a day
ago if you've been following my
Instagram I actually took a vacation for
the first time in like a year it was
great I'm appearance in New Orleans
definitely not somewhere I want to go
back but it was fun while I was there oh
okay so it looks like one end is a
spooly let's just team the brows for a
sec I am gonna be having an updated brow
routine so it looks just like a kind of
medium brown what are we gonna do right
now oh man
I really have people at these things it
definitely looks like supernatural I
think what we're going to do is just
apply this on the first like half of my
eyebrow then I'm going to do my normal
routine for the second half I'm going to
go in with my Ulta brow tint this has
been like the love of my life this month
I was gonna finish up the rest of my
brows with my normal routine and I will
be right back
rouser on I think I'm gonna zoom you
guys in a little bit yeah my eyeballs
hurt freaking light is literally
blinding alright so I'm gonna go in with
Mac's painterly paint-pot to prime our
eyeballs I'm going to try out they're
naturally pretty volume one match I
showed a pal oh I totally forgot to
announce that I am going to be in LA
next week on the weekend of the 30th and
I'm gonna be at generation Beauty I
actually wasn't planning on going but I
ended up having to go to LA for a
business trip anyways so if you're gonna
be there
comment down below it'd be freaking
awesome to meet you guys woo all right
this is really pretty
I'm gonna start out with this fluffy
brush and take sheer joy and we're just
gonna Pat this all over to kind of set
that what the called primer this will
just make it easier to blend everything
else out on top of it
no idea what kind of look we're doing
right now this sunset and sunrise color
right here look really appealing to me
yeah let's do it
I was gonna take that same fluffy brush
and take sunrise and put this in a
crease I'm going to take that sunset
color I believe yeah we're gonna take
the other end of this brush and put this
on the lid and tap it off it looks like
there's a little bit of fallout with
this I think we're actually only going
to put this on the outer third because
it looks a little darker than I thought
outer third turned into the outer half I
think I'm actually going to take Stila
kitten for the inner half or whatever
boland into that reddish color that
turned into super pretty like Goldy
champagne color
anyone else not see for like three
seconds after they apply eyeshadow now
we're going to take this deep brown
color called Java right here just
creating a little v-shape with this to
help give the eye some definition and
then I'm just going to drag whatever is
left over into the crease I'm going to
take a kind of smaller blending brush to
blend this out just because I want to
blend the brown a little bit upwards
rather than putting it down onto the lid
just so you can keep precise I'm just
going to use this thing and just put
them a good song or something and blend
away I'm just going to lay down a tiny
bit more of sunset and I'm also going to
take a little bit more kitten this just
really on the innermost part and then
blend with the second finger so it
doesn't have any pigment on it for a
brow bone and a highlight I'm going to
go in with transforming pearl and I
think yeah so you can if you want to
make any of these like shimmery your
supposed to be able to dip your brush in
the matte color and then put it in the
transforming pearl and then you have a
shimmery eyeshadow put this under the
brow bone so for the bottom lashline I'm
going to go back in with sunrise I think
that summer eyed shade is my favorite so
far I feel like this is a really nice
warm shade that can work with a lot of
different looks I'm gonna pop some black
eyeliner in the waterline I normally
apply mascara after my falsies I just
like to blend it in with the lash so I
don't have to do it two steps but I want
to see how this mascara looks on its own
before we put false lashes on so this is
the hello lashes five in one mascara and
this is a really big box so I'm assuming
this bottle is like huge
so looking online it looks like this is
a melted fiber technology have like the
fiber things but basically make it so
there's no fallout which is really nice
it's pretty much everything free no
parabens fragrance sulfate free cruelty
free everything free so this looks kind
of like a vape so let's just see how
this works this wand is actually really
nice it has like a
grip longer comes on one side and then
it has this little ball thing at the end
I was onto your lashes really nice I'm
just kind of turning it
this is what it looks like up close so
you guys can see I'm gonna with my
favorite I'm you know glam 12 lashes you
guys are probably sick of these by now
but I'd like them strike shampoo is so
bad
definitely gone an entire day with a
white patch on my head lashes are on I
love using these lashes because I feel
like I don't have to apply our liner
when I wear them they're just super
dramatic you are it looks like there's a
black shade in here and I'm just going
to take this brush and blend it on the
bottom lash line if you just smudge a
little black eye shadow when you're
wearing eyeliner in your waterline just
helps to blend everything together last
step of eyes we're just going to take a
tiny bit of Khitan on my finger and just
put that on the bottom lash line on the
inner corner for lips I'm going to start
out with the essence lip liner in soft
berry this is like a dollar from Ulta
and freaking amazing
I feel like berry tones and like deep
red tones will look good with this kind
of eye you could totally just wear this
lip color if you wanted to but I kind of
want to deepen it up a little bit
NARS pure matte lipstick and Tara
diffuse it's basically just like a deep
burgundy color you can use any kind of
color that you have like this alright so
this is the final look if you guys liked
this video give it a thumbs up so I know
let me know down below if you guys would
want to see another eye local or like
full review on this palette actually
really pretty love you guys thanks for
watching see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
