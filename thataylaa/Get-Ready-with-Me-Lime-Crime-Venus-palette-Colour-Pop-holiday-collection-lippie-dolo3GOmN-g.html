piece on the look I'm wearing right now
use a new one crying Venus palette can
we just look at this if you like we need
a moment of silence for this palette use
some new products on my face that I
haven't used in a while there's a
literal snowstorm going on outside in
Seattle and it's kind of confusing use
some new stuff on the face use something
from the colour-pop cosmetics Holiday
Collection yeah more of the stories we
have some exciting products in this
video as always if you want to see more
shadow and schmooze videos I will link
them in the down bar I have a whole
playlist of them I don't think I've ever
mentioned before but I do have a whole
playlist if you just want to go on a
shadow and schmooze watching spree
they're all down there so if you want to
see how I got this look you're in the
right place
just keep watching I just need to have a
pair of sunglasses like ready to go in
this room we're just dealing with the
lighting just hope that there's no
lawnmower so I just took a shower and
I've voiced Erised my face with the
Mario Badescu Badescu oil-free
moisturizer this has SPF 30 so far feels
nice absorbed really nicely into my skin
and then for a primer I'm gonna try out
the Blues shiny primer never heard and
we talked about this I got this in my
last Mimi box this is a huge-ass primer
like look at how big this is ooh smells
really interesting it really is like a
light blue color this actually smells
exactly like the Korres primer yeah like
identical I think I am gonna invest in
the deburring light because this is a
little ridiculous I love natural
lighting but you really never know
what's gonna happen I was gonna use the
Kat Von D l42
foundation because Kat Von D did restock
the lightest shade which I'm super happy
about I was gonna use that but I cannot
find it anywhere so what are we doing
Taylor so I've never tried this combo
before but I think we're gonna try the
Paula's Choice best face forward
foundation mixed in with Estee Lauder
Double Wear grace this stuff is
definitely a little bit too dark I think
I tried this one time before
it sounds pretty liquidy so I'm just
doing about half of each on the back of
my
go north the Sigma f80 flat top kabuki
brush just to blend this out makes it a
little bit more of this on the back of
my hand I actually really like the
consistency of these two mixed together
I'm just gonna go over any acne spots on
my chin that it hasn't covered up you
can't acne I feel like since I stopped
using benefit Porefessional a few days
ago feel like my acne has gone down
which is interesting a few of you guys
come to it saying that benefit
Porefessional broke you out I'm gonna
try and go off it for a couple weeks and
see if my skin clears up I really hope
it's not that because I love that primer
so for concealer I'm gonna use the
Rimmel match perfect concealer this is
in the shade 125 fair I posted something
on Instagram mentioning this and you
guys wanted to hear my thoughts on this
I have been using this kind of just to
use it I don't think it's that amazing I
do see it creasing a little bit
throughout the day the applicator which
is this brush just drives me insane
you can't even squeeze the product out
of it like it gets clogged in here I
have tried removing the lid I don't know
if I'm just having issues but I can't
get this frickin brush off so basically
just squeeze it out as much as I can
onto my finger and then go ahead and
apply to the under eyes also it is
snowing right now in Seattle what is
happening the Sun is out I don't think I
would repurchase this stuff again I'm
kind of just using it to use it up so
the set the under eye Physicians Formula
correcting powder like always
the rest of my face actually set really
nicely I don't know if that was the
Estee Lauder I feel like the Estee
Lauder doesn't usually set like this I'm
kind of confused right now
so just to like fully set everything you
probably could skip this stuff because
it's looking pretty dang good right now
I'm just gonna use a little bit of the
Ben Nye powder in cameo this is like the
banana powder just in the lightest shade
if you're a fair-skinned you do not want
to be putting banana powder in your face
you'll literally look like you have
jaundice not cute I actually think the
best way to find this stuff is to go a
little bit overboard and then just brush
it off with the powder brush just take
any powder brush you have and just brush
that away so sculpt out the cheekbones
I'm going to be using my sedona least
from the least i Sedona lace palette and
a lot of you guys tweeted me on Black
Friday saying that you got this half off
which is awesome I think it was $7 on
sale and then you could use my $4 off
coupon
so it's basically free it also works for
deeper skin because they have this
banana color powder in here and then
this darker shade is just perfect I'm
going to take that lightest shade and
run it on my forehead I'm also going to
take the completely white powder in here
and just pop some on the inner corner
and
rich my news son is behind the cloud it
so for blush I'm going to take you go
NYX blush in peach this doesn't really
look peachy to me at all it's more like
a light pink tone and just popping this
on that is the wind just gonna spray my
whole face with skin and navy a setting
spray alright I'm just going to do my
brows and I will be right back if you
want to see how I do my brows I will
link a couple videos down below but I'm
just doing the same exact thing so the
browser on I primed my eyes I think I'm
gonna use my Lime Crime Venus palette I
haven't used this in a video yet because
filmed an entire tutorial using this
that I didn't put up the lighting was
horrible and we had lots of issues going
on this palette is freaking beautiful I
know that it originally was gonna be
limited edition and I think they made it
permanent so you can't still get your
hands on this at the time when I bought
this I was not aware of all the
going down with Lime Crime a lot of you
guys are commenting on Instagram about
that and I had no idea I'm taking the
shade divine and pulling this in the
crease I don't really know what kind of
look I'm doing right now we'll see I
want to do anything too dramatic I think
I'm just gonna do like a neutral kind of
smokey eye
this brush evey 13 by Sedona lace is
perfect for blending in colors to the
crease actually reach for this one over
my Sigma e-40 you impact the color on
and blend at the same time it's just
perfect so next I'm going to take Ora
which is this light shimmery like white
is shade ooh this is pretty
whoo this is really pretty I still put
this all over the lid not gonna lie this
looks like 50 times better on the eye
than it does in
the palette also the nail-polish I'm
wearing a keep it in common this is the
Revlon Colorstay in Provence I actually
really like this line of nail polish
they're like really thick alright spent
on a evo 9 brush by Sedona lace I'm
taking Christian reminds me of brown
scratch by Mac and yeah totally we're
just gonna put this on the outer third
and then blend inwards
I'm just going to take whatever is left
over on that brush not a little bit of
divine and then run this along the lower
lash line my side watering is the worst
going in with my Holy Grail Physicians
Formula I booster eyeliner I feel like
there's like 10 steps and my shadow inch
means that we could just skip because I
do them every time
I was going to take the lightest shade
in my position squirming that shimmer
breaks this is definitely been like a
favorite of mine when we using the
lightest shade and just putting that on
the inner corner you can use this on
your eyes or face as a highlight Cupid's
bow send on that same brush I'm going to
take icon which is this deep brown color
and just run this on the bottom lashline
a bit actually not on that brush for
this I'm going to use just a flat
eyeliner brush I'm just kind of stamping
this color on there to create a line on
the outer third all right so I'm not
gonna be putting falsies on today
because I don't feel like it I'm just
gonna put on my Maybelline falsies and
mascara and then some bottom mascara and
I will be right back alright so top and
bottom mascara is on I also added some
white eyeliner to the waterline just to
brighten things up a little bit for lips
I'm thinking we're gonna go in with
something from the colour-pop cosmetics
Holiday Collection which looks like this
lady which is a matte shade looks
exactly like diva this is like my
favorite color in the collection
debating whether I want to use this are
new today let's just go all out let's
ease lady and these legit smell a cake
if anyone else has a lip ring then you
know the struggle is so real so this is
the final look we have wet hair today
