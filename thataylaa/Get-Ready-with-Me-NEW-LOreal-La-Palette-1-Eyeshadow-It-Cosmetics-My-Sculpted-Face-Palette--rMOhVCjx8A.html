mousse on the look I'm wearing right now
I'm like majorly slumped down right now
because the bun has to be in the frame
if you're new to my channel shout into
his videos are basically where we get
ready and just talk about things I have
a few exciting products that I'm using
in this video the foundation I'm wearing
is actually the NARS all day luminous
foundation which will be a activist I'll
have a whole review coming on that so I
didn't do my foundation but I did the
rest of my makeup is the new L'Oreal
lafalot nude lip palette nude one oh new
background so clearly we're in a
different room right now again if you've
been following my leopard row blogs and
basically you're doing a whole room swap
right now this is the new filming room
but it's gonna look probably totally
different in the background so let me
know what you guys think if you want to
see how I got this look you're in the
right place just keep watching all right
so my foundation is already on because
I'm currently filming a review on the
NARS all day luminous liquid foundation
finally so I'm just gonna be finishing
up my face and then doing an eye look I
make all over the place right now
and be doing an eye look using the la
palette nude one from L'Oreal this is
brand new they have a one and two I just
like the shades that are in the ones so
that's what I got
alright so the first thing I'm gonna do
is take the ICO London brow gel shape
into fine this doesn't have a shade I
don't know if they have different shades
I've been using this everyday for my
brows just to kind of comb them out and
it adds a tiny bit of color it is a
super wet formula so you have to wait
for it to dry before you do anything
else to your brows which is why I do it
before everything else let me know down
below if you guys have any brow gels
that you really like I've never used
them until now and I kind of want to
train more so I'm just gonna apply the
what is this Maybelline fit me concealer
in the shade 15 fair to my under eyes
this is looking super pink compared to
my face right now because the NARS
foundation is super yellow I've been
using this concealer every single day I
mentioned it my March reason rejects
video and I love it
15 fair is lighter than the lightest
shade which is 10 sometimes if you tried
out ten and is too dark for you
definitely try out the shade 15 it still
is a little bit dark but I use the
Physicians Formula powder over it which
lightens everything up I usually put
this on the center of my face like my
forehead a little bit down the nose and
on my chin I'm gonna be skipping that
today since I'm reviewing the foundation
so I'm going to take my favorite
Physicians Formula powders I'm just kind
of doing this pouncing and we're just
gonna set the concealer on the under
I've got the foundation on for about 10
minutes and it's still feeling pretty
sticky so I'm not gonna do my contour
and stuff yet I'm gonna go in and do my
brows well this is hopefully dries and
then we'll finish up the face I just
like to carve my brows out with this
just to clean everything up and I'm
gonna have a full eyebrow routine coming
up soon to just get super dark brows are
done so the foundation still hasn't set
so I'm going to go ahead and do eyes and
then come back to it still feels pretty
freakin tacky
I'm using Mac's Paint Pot in painterly
for the eyes I think I put the same pot
for literally like three years probably
really unsanitary but it still works
great I'm putting this all the way up to
the brow and then also underneath
because they're gonna be applying shadow
there okay so for eyes like I mentioned
I'm gonna be using the new L'Oreal
palette
how many shades are in here one two
three ten shades in here there's some
really nice warm toned ones and a nice
like champagne highlight one which I'm
super excited to use this is interesting
I think we're gonna put this in the
dress
I feel like this foundation makes me
look like deathly ill alright so I'm
going to take the Sedona lace 941 brush
this is just a big powder brush lip
brush we're gonna take the lightest
shade in here which is like a light it
looks pretty matte to me this is the
shade one I'm going to put this
everywhere where we applied the primer
just to make it easier to blend other
colors on top of it it's actually I was
like a slight shimmer to it which I
don't mind we're going to take this rosy
pink shade right here which is number
three I'm going to take my favorite
Sedona lace EB 13 brush we're gonna
blend this into the crease
so far they don't pull anything out
really well and are pretty pigmented
they don't have any kind of black or
really dark shade in here besides this
brown so if you want to do any kind of
more dramatic look you're gonna have to
use your own shadow so I'm using the
Milani Bella black this is just a black
eyeshadow I don't think I've ever
actually used this shadow okay I don't
know if it's the black shadow or what
but this is looking kind of funky you
guys see that I'm going to use Urban
Decay blackout instead that looks way
better so I'm just making a v-shape and
I'm not bringing this up super far
because we're gonna blend everything
together so I want to go back in with
the shade that we use from the crease
number three and just blend that a
little bit next we're gonna go in with
the lightest champagne shimmery color
number ten and I'm just gonna take my
finger and put this on the lid doesn't
as pigmented as I was expecting
let's see Oh looks pretty round the wood
let me go back in with a tiny bit more
black out I totally forgot to talk first
rate like one minute now we're gonna
take number six the matte brown shade in
here I'm just gonna blend this on the
bottom lashline I want to keep this
mostly on the outer third so our eyes
look bigger I feel like it's making it
look uneven because there's more light
on this side of my face I'm gonna be
changing the position everything of this
camera so I'm going to take a tiny bit
of black out for the bottom lash line on
the 9:04 brush
I'm going to take the Milani brow and I
highlight pencil and I'm going to use
the matte shade that's a matte side and
then a luminous side for like under your
brows I'm going to try this thing this
is the tony moly crystal tear glitter
white eyeliner I think I got this from a
Mimi box looks pretty okay we're going
to put this on the inner corner and just
see what happens and literally just put
in like a tiny dot of this just to open
up the eye I'm also going to put this a
little bit on the bottom okay we're not
doing a dot apparently flashes I kind of
want to just do a more natural lash so
I'm going to use number 48 by Kara I got
these off of shop Missa and there they
were a dollar all their eye lashes are
dollar which is insane we're just gonna
apply these and I'll be right back
alright lashes are on these remind me a
lot of the demi 120 whispies gonna use
the Maybelline lash sensational mascara
and put a little bit of this on just to
blend everything together when I blend
my natural lashes with falsies I find
it's easier to put my brush upward and
then just kind of push it right into the
false lash I'm just going to take my
favorite wet-and-wild mega length
mascara and apply this to the bottom
lashes I'm not gonna be doing eyeliner
in this look because I feel like I feel
like we don't need it with the falsies
and the black outer V I mentioned this
in my 10 most repurchase drugstore
makeup items video doesn't transfer to
your concealer it dries fast it's
waterproof and it's my thing so the eyes
are finished let's see how the face is
doing it feels less tacky I think I
think we're good to go
so to contour I'm going to use the it
cosmetics my sculpted face palette I
haven't used this before I've used this
like a couple times just like playing
around with it but I haven't really
given it a fair go there is a white
powder in here which is mostly the
reason why I bought this palette I
absolutely love my sit on a lace contour
palette with white powder I've mentioned
that probably ten times on my channel
but we're gonna try this one out I'm
gonna take the Sedona lace 850 brush and
this is just an angled brush let's go in
with this shade right here
all right so I'd actually blend it out
super nicely and it's a lot more
pigmented than I remember it
some unknown black stuff going on I'm
going to take a little bit of this shade
right here which is a tad lighter and
put this on my forehead I'm gonna go in
with the white powder and put a little
bit for this on my chin like forehead
and then a tiny bit under the eyes and
just see if it brightens it up at all I
have a whole video on how I highlight in
contour which goes in-depth about all of
this feel like that white powder
basically did nothing when you swatch it
on your finger it shows up and then when
you blend it into your skin it just kind
of disappears let's test out this
highlight there's like a light
pinky highlight in here that looks
pretty Rocky let's try it out put this
on the cheekbone whoa that was a lot Oh
correct I'm also gonna take this down
the bridge of my nose my Cupid's bow
it's gonna take a powder brush and blend
that out it is actually really pretty on
the skin actually like that highlight we
need some major blush right now because
feel like I look like I have an illness
with this foundation because it's so
yellow tone I'm going with the Polish
choice they came out with this palette
which is really cool too blush contour
palette I'm gonna take my 813 brush by
Stone release what shade should we use I
think we're gonna take this kind of fun
you know this is we're gonna take the
shade right here blends out super easy
it's pigmented I like it
I think I have a $10 off coupon code for
you guys for polish twice which I'll
link down below for lips I think we're
just gonna do a nude I haven't tried
this combo before but we're gonna going
with these two bad boys this is the NYX
extreme shine oh that's not what I
wanted NYX soft matte lip cream in the
shade Stockholm and then we're gonna go
in with this Revlon gloss over top
it's definitely more like orangey tone
that I wanted so I think we're gonna go
in with we're going with the Revlon 0:02
pink pout lipstick this is like a matte
pinky purple okay it's definitely more
what I was thinking in my head so we're
gonna go my sugar mama by gerard
cosmetics is my favorite pink lip gloss
of all time the light does kind of
bother me I feel like it's harder to see
what you're doing I think that's
everything
all right so it's good you guys in so
you can see what the makeup looks like
up close amazing do it I mean I'm just
leaning forward and my legs are getting
a workout actually really like these
lashes without the eyeliner if you guys
