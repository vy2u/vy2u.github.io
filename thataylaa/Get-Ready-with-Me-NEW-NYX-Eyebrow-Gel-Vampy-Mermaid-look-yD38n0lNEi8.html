shadow news video on the look I'm
wearing right now I'm really working on
smiling with my eyes guys
I feel like it's kind of like Marilyn
Manson meets Ariel The Little Mermaid
you feel me this is a super easy kind of
smokey eye look and you could substitute
out the lid color for whatever color you
wanted if you don't feel like rocking a
blue shadow you can go with a more
neutral tone or whatever you want I used
a bunch of new products and combos of
makeup and random so if you want to
see this look then just keep watching
got my mug is that backwards for you
guys from sweaty wisdom if you want to
check it out link will be below ready
for the world great lipstick on a coffee
mug is a whole new look I feel super out
of the filming groove right now so I've
already prepped my face by washing and
moisturizing and priming I just use the
Maybelline instant age rewind primer
that's just like my go-to one when I
don't want to think about what primer to
use there's too many options you know
I'm saying for a foundation I wanted to
try out this BB plus illumination by
Gerard cosmetics I haven't tried this
before and it's just like an
illuminating cream that you can mix in
with foundation or wearing your
cheekbones or wherever you want to
highlight so I'm going to be mixing it
in with the Kat Von D locket tattoo
foundation because this is super matte
so will really be able to see how much
this illuminates this isn't the shade
l42 which was discontinued by Kat Von D
and so for just announced that they're
bringing it back for all the pale
princesses out there that's some
exciting news I think you just got way
too much I've never used this like I
said so I don't know how much I'm
supposed to mix in here let's just start
with a little like half pump it looks
pretty bronzed I don't know if I got a
look enough illumination we'll see I
haven't used Kat Von D foundation in
forever now because I've been hoarding
it since I thought that they weren't
continuing l42 it's one of the only
foundations that is actually light
enough on its own for my skin so you can
definitely see a little bit of doing
this it doesn't look like too much it
just makes
so my face doesn't look completely flat
like it usually does with a matte
foundation I think we're gonna have to
get a ponytail soon I forgot how much
coverage this has I definitely like
how it just gave a little bit of doing
this to the foundation this would be
perfect to mix in with foundations that
you like the coverage but you don't
necessarily like the finish of it before
concealers I'm going with my usual
Revlon age-defying mixed in with NYX HD
lavender concealer you guys said you
still wanted me to show this so that's
what we're doing even though I did the
same thing every time I can't remember
if I've announced this in a video yet or
not but my best friend Rachel got the
job in Seattle so she's moving here and
I'm super stoked she's actually here
right now and she's staying with me for
a couple weeks at this apartment before
early starts on August 1st I just sent
her off to the aquarium so that's what's
happening right now but it's been really
fun because now I have someone to go do
like touristy with we went to the
Washington Arboretum yesterday which is
basically this giant freaking forest I
also learned that there are actually
people called arborist which they
basically design Arboretum's how does
one get into tree design why are we
talking about trees right now then I'm
going to take the Physicians Formula
translucent light correcting powder like
always and set the under-eye concealer
with this a couple people tweeted me
saying they bought this and they love it
it's light enough for them that makes me
happy I'm glad and the brush I'm using
is the ELF powder brush I've been using
this brush to set my under eye concealer
for forever I just like how dense it is
I feel like it just places the product
really well then just address my face
laura geller balance and brighten this
is one of my favorite powders like I've
mentioned multiple times before but I
have learned that it doesn't sit on your
face very well for long periods of time
I thought it was the primer or
foundation I was using but it's
definitely the powder when I go to work
now I don't wear this just because I'm
there for like over nine hours and by
the end of the day it just looks really
like scaly and bad and cakey so I've
been switching up my powders for work to
try and find one that I really like but
like today if I'm not going to be
wearing makeup for a long-ass time then
I just go with laura geller
alright so I think we're going to go and
do a light kind of contour and I'm just
using the NYX blush in raisin and this
is a good contour if you have fair skin
I'm just using this pink brush that is
like broken I don't even know why I'm
using this like why don't I just those
out I think I got this at IMATS like
a couple years ago I haven't been to a
matte since are you guys going now mats
should I go to IMATS I don't know
alright anyways it will do for now and
it's pink so I like it I am just
psoralen my brush in here and we're
going to do a contour so it looks like
we're doing a pretty intense contour
today but I realize how pigmented this
stuff was so for blush I'm going to be
using wet and wild a persimmon Pinker
was a pearlescent pink there we go and
this stuff is super pigmented so I'm
literally just tapping my brush one time
and we're just going to lightly dab this
on so I'm going to go in with a clean
Real Techniques blush brush and just
blend this out eyebrows for me are
usually that part of the makeup routine
that I am just not looking forward to
but today I'm super stoked because I'm
trying out a new product NYX eyebrow gel
I picked this up from Ulta and this is
in the shade expresso I've never used
this before it's supposed to be like a
long-lasting gel I think it's even
supposed to be waterproof let's just
read about it I think they had four or
five shades so to apply this I'm just
going to squeeze a little bit on the
back of my hand and then go ahead and
dip my eyebrow brush into it the brush
I'm using is just my mini Ecotools brush
this is interesting it feels kind of
like the anastasia dipbrow pomade when
you're applying it even though it's a
totally different formula
I definitely got way too much on the
back of my hand this is enough for like
all of America's eyebrows right here so
I'm actually really happy with the way
that that applied it was super quick and
easy if you don't like the look of super
defined brows you could probably use a
lighter hand and use less product and
get the effect that you want but I
person
like really it sculpted out where I was
clearly the four eyeshadow primer I'm
just using Urban Decay's primer potion
just because I have this tiny sample
thing that I want to get rid of so I
went into the Mac here in Seattle and
obviously got that I did not need
isn't it amazing how you just magically
empty out your wallet when you walk into
a Mac counter it's amazing the things I
got was the pro eyeshadow and
uninterrupted this is like one of the
most well known Pro eyeshadow I haven't
put it in a palette yet so I'm just
gonna hold it and we're gonna chill so
I'm just applying this to the crease
with a fluffy blending brush this is
just one of those eyeshadows that you
could literally wear with any look it
has a really interesting like tone
to it you know what I mean well we have
this color on the brush I'm just going
to run a little bit on the bottom lash
line or the blue color I'm going to be
using Milwaukee's Bella teal this is the
gel powder eye shadow I don't really get
the whole gel vibe from these to me it
just feels like a powder so I'm just
taking this on an urban decay brush I
think it's from the Naked 2 palette or
Naked palette one of those and we're
just gonna pull out this on the lid so I
wanted to attempt to use a brush for my
lid just to see if I was missing out on
something in the world and I'm
definitely not I think it applies so
much better with your finger so now I'm
gonna go over that with my finger like
look at how much more pigmented that is
it sounds a really pretty kind of teal
undertone to it I'm going to take the
shade by Milani and it's kind of I don't
even know what you would call this color
it's apparently a charcoal I'm just
going to put this on the outer third of
my eye then I'm going to blend that
inwards a little bit I feel like I'm
kind of out of it right now
like I need energy or more caffeine or
something so I'm going to go back in
with uninterrupted and just add a little
bit more of that to warm up the crease
alright so I'm going to take my la girl
blight on black liner put this on the
waterline that's what that's called so
then you can take any black eyeshadow
that you have I'm just using this shade
from the real tube palette and I'm using
a sigma e30 pencil brush for this and
I'm
going to run that on the outer third of
the eye just to blend out that waterline
if you do that last step I just feel
like it really helps to smoke everything
out and blend it all out so for eyeliner
I'm going to use my usual Physicians
Formula i booster and I always mention
this stuff and I wanted to point out
that make sure you get the very black
shade I think it's called
ultra black there is a gray color and a
black color in an ultra black color and
a couple people tweeted me saying that
it wasn't black at all make sure you get
the ultra black one because this one is
the alright so we finished up the
eyeliner and mascara for mascara I use
the usual but I've been really enjoying
using the falsies brush for the miss
manga formula I don't know I just like
the way it looks I think I'm going to go
with a gray kind of lip just because I
bought a stone lip liner at Mac and I
need to justify that purchase so I'm
just going to line my lips with this and
then also fill it in so I'm going to go
in with NYX macaron lipstick in the
shade black sesame I have a whole first
impressions video on the NYX macaron
lipsticks if you want to see that there
we go I think we're going to add a
little bit of a highlight and I'm using
essence blew me up highlighter I'm just
using a stippling brush with this and
we're just going to pop this on the top
of our cheekbones alright so this is the
final look I don't even know what to
call this I feel like it's kind of like
a vampy mermaid maybe that's what we'll
call it like always all the products
will be listed below if you're curious
about anything and you want to check it
