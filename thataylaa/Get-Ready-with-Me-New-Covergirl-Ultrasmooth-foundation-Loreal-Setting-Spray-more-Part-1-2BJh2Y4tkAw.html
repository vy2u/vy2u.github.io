moose on the look I'm wearing right now
this video is gonna be two parts part
one this video is just going to be you
my face so all of this I wanted to split
this up into two videos because I have
some exciting things that I'm talking
about in this video
lots of other things that I can't hold
in my hands have some exciting products
that I wanted to mention and just talk
about like more in depth I'm also pre
recording a bunch of videos right now so
you guys have stuff to watch over the
holidays that was a long intro I'm gonna
stop talking and you can watch me put
things on my face alright so I'm trying
out a little bit of a different angle
and everything my face is on the
computer right now this is weird I just
ordered the diva ring light so this is
all probably gonna change so I'm already
washed and primed in my face I use the
new Revlon Prime and anti-shine balm I
actually really like this stuff and I
think it works surprisingly well so I
mentioned this in my drugstore haul but
this is basically I'm get it open this
is just a primer and balm form so I went
to Ulta yesterday wasn't planning on
buying anything in obviously this
happened I'm gonna track the new
covergirl ultra smooth foundation and
applicator I don't think I've seen any
videos on this yet this is in the shade
805 ivory and it looks like it has a
really interesting applicator I'm not
exactly sure how this thing is supposed
to work so I guess it's supposed to
minimize the look of flaws and find
facial hair hella yeah you guys know
I've got some of that going on so I know
I have a whole video on how I dare my
face you want to see that so I guess
you're supposed to squeeze a small drop
of foundation directly onto the
applicator and applied to face in the
direction of facial hair growth I don't
know let's try it out I'm hoping that
this is gonna be light enough my other
cover girl foundation is like doable but
it actually looks pretty light I'm not
really sure how you're supposed to hold
this let's do this
this feels very odd and wrong um it
feels very bizarre I don't think this
thing is doing anything because if you
apply anything in the direction of your
hair theoretically it should help in
this just yeah we're gonna
ixnay this thing separate more extinct
we're gonna toss this jelly thing and
let's just try it with a brush so to
apply this I'm going to use my Sedona
lace FBO 7 a foundation brush this has
been like my favorite brush lately I
feel like the consistency is kind of
like a gel so far not the best coverage
let's see if I can build it up a little
bit yeah this is definitely light
coverage it's basically just cancelling
out my redness but it's not covering any
of my acne or anything which by the way
I feel like my acne is getting a lot
better I know this is still like bad for
compared to normal people's standards
but for me this is a lot clearer that my
skin has been in the last few weeks let
me know if you guys want a current
skincare routine things I'm using for my
acne it's obviously nowhere near perfect
yet but let me know if you want like a
progress video yeah so I would say this
is definitely more for people that want
light coverage it feels really nice on
the skin it just feels like a
moisturizer but it's not doing anything
for me so I'm just gonna take some my
Revlon Colorstay and I just put a pump
on here this is from BBMP I will leave
their link down below but they basically
have pumps for like all different kinds
of foundations I also got one for my
maybelline superstay this is awesome
because everyone wants a frickin pump so
I'm just putting a little bit of a long
fellers day on the back of my hand and
I'm gonna mix in a little bit of the
covergirl color wise the covergirl is
pretty light which I appreciate if I
remember correctly they did have a
pretty good selection but I love that
colors day
all right so that mixed in is definitely
giving me more of the coverage that I
need and some of it just kind of an
update on my foundations lately doc
using benefit Porefessional and I've
stopped using Maybelline Dream wonder
and I don't know which one it is but my
skin has definitely been clearing up I
love love love both of those products if
you don't have sensitive skin you should
be fine
I don't know I really hope that's not
what was causing the breakouts all right
that definitely gave me more of the
coverage that I like I've been on the
hunt for a good concealer for fair skin
and I tweeted you guys asking which ones
are your favorites and a lot of people
said the NARS concealer in Chantilly so
I did give the NARS radiant creamy
concealer I've been using this for about
the last two weeks now and I am
completely completely in love with it
this is perfect for under the eyes it
doesn't crease it gives you great
coverage it's just like the literally
the perfect consistency you could ask
for in a concealer
all right I have absolutely zero idea
where that just cut out I switched back
to the viewfinder mode because just
wasn't working so I just set my face
with the laura geller balance and
brighten powder and porcelain I used to
be obsessed with this stuff I don't know
why I stopped using it because it's
beautiful it just gives you the perfect
finish it's just amazing
so for bronzer and reusing the essence
sudden club bar Sun Club Sun Club
bronzer in blonds it works I got this
from Fred Meyer if you have a Fred Meyer
bayou they have tons of essence products
and these are all like two or three
dollars they have way better of a
selection than oltre does so I'm just
going to take my domed what is this
called
I said own Elise FBO five brush this is
my favorite brush to contour lately and
we're just gonna contour it up the best
way that I find to contour is if you
make kind of a fish face the line right
there is where you want a shadow then if
you bring it on the top of your forehead
we just kind of want to make a three
shape with this now we have cheekbones
this is definitely more of a warm toned
bronzer so if you're someone who likes
cartoons well if someone who likes more
cool toned bronzers which I usually am
to recommend the Sedona nice contour
palette which I used in a couple videos
ago a link down below this is good if
you just want to like warm up your face
a little bit so blush I've been obsessed
with this month is yeah it's got misuse
this is the wet and wild pearlescent
pink blush if you've been watching my
channel for a while literally a year ago
I was obsessed with this thing and I
used to every single day and I'm kind of
back to that now I've hit pan this is
like one of those og drugstore products
where's the brush there is this is a
super super pigmented blush and the best
brush I found to apply it is a more
stippling brush perfect for applying
super pigmented products because it just
places like the perfect amount on your
face I also love this brush because it
allows you to like pack the blush on
rather than blending and blending the
foundation off but it still looks
blended and like flawless so just a
little life update right now I leave for
home in four days super nice because I
get a week off of actual work I'm not
actually stopping workings I still have
to be checked
my email and doing a few things over the
break but super nice to have that whole
week like to be able to leave and go
home
trying to get like six videos
pre-recorded and edited for you guys so
you have something to watch while I'm
gone that's the thing like both of my
jobs I absolutely love and feel so
thankful for but there's no actual break
I feel like just for myself I really
need to take this week and actually have
a break because gonna be working super
hard this weekend to get all these
videos up for you guys and then just
kind of peace out for a week I'm shaking
that powder brush and kind of blending
everything together for highlight gonna
be taking us into blew me up shimmer
powder and meets a lot of essence today
this is in the shade rose it up this
might have been limitation but I
recently saw it at Fred Meyer so I think
you can still grab this stuff this is an
amazing drugstore highlighter and I'm
just gonna be taking me so don't lace
FBO one brush like this thing is
ridiculous but it works so well and yeah
it just makes applying a highlight like
the easiest process ever like look just
places it exactly where you want it if
you're a beginner this brush is like
foolproof I feel like we're just placing
this on top of the blush on top of our
cheekbones and then a little bit under
the brow bone as well I'm also gonna be
running this down the bridge of my nose
my Cupid's bow so to set my face I'm
using the Loreal makeups extender
setting spray I mentioned this in a
drugstore haul video which I'll link
over here and you guys want to hear my
thoughts on this stuff I've been using
this for about a week and a half now and
I love it I have zero issues with it
some people said it irritated their skin
I haven't noticed that I think it's just
as good as my skin and Navia setting
spray and this is about ten bucks
cheaper I will totally be repurchasing
this the only downside to me is the
spray it's you kind of get a shower when
you spray this on it's a little
ridiculous I don't know why they didn't
just invest in a better top like I'm
pretty sure just got half my hair wet I
also just bought the Mario Badescu Rose
setting spray which a lot of you guys
mentioned so let me know if you guys
want to see that and the next shadow
mousse alright so here's the final look
the eyes and lips will be up after this
video so make sure you subscribe so you
don't miss out on that
if you like shouting schmooze videos I'm
sure you give this a thumbs up so I know
I don't know what in this video will it
be up but I hope you have an awesome
holidays or break or whatever you're
doing right now I'm down below let me
know what you guys are doing love you
guys thanks for watching and see you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
