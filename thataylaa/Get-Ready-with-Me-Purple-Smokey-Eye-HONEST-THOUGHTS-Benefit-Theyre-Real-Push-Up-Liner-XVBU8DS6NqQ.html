today we have a shadowing schmooze on
the left I'm Wayne right now super
excited for this video because I'm
trying out a bunch of stuff that I got
off of Lamba if you haven't heard of
glam but where have you been
if you've been watching my videos for a
while you know that I used to be like an
avid blog sale make up fire this is
basically that except put on a website
and it's freaking amazing
flambo is the site where they buy and
sell gently previously worn makeup they
have a super intense sanitation process
so if you're a germaphobe don't worry
about it it's fine you'll find some
super good deals on high-end makeup also
if you're into like collecting mac
makeup they have a bunch of stuff on
there that was either a limited edition
at some point or it's part of a certain
collection I'll leave all their info and
a coupon code for you guys down below if
you want to check them out
you should I didn't do my face makeup in
this shot on shmooze because I filmed a
whole other video on how I contour and
highlight my face that will be up after
this video so make sure you subscribe so
you don't miss out on that
if you want to see how I got this look
you're in the right place just keep
watching
all right I'm super stoked for this
video because I have a bunch of exciting
things to try out so I'm just gonna dig
into my glam buff bag and let's go to
down they stuck in this NARS Coke
Copacabana voluma nater which was a free
gift which was really cool it's actually
a pretty decent size like when are you
ever going to use this much illuminator
in your life I don't know I'm going to
use this as an eye primer because why
not
we're just putting this all over the
lids I'm gonna start off with the Shan
EXO color pop collection I think this is
so awesome when youtubers get to
collaborate with brands to make their
own products like how freakin cool is
that
the shade selfie in here as soon as I
saw this I was like hell yeah this is
like the perfect warm tone crease color
and it is matte I believe yeah I'm going
to take that on my favorite blending
Brad which is the Sedona lace Eevee 13
brush I think these are pretty pigmented
so I'm not gonna take a lot I'm just
gonna blend that into the crease
I love these like warm brown tones
greatest thing ever this is blending out
really nice
actually the perfect crease color you
like I could stare at this thing all day
so what we haven't so now I'm just gonna
take a little fun amazing 9:04 brush and
just blend this on the bottom lash line
which might look kind of funky right now
but we're just gonna go with it I think
there's some leftover something on this
brush because it's looking a little bit
for me actually feels like it has a nice
stickiness to it all right so where this
whole eye look I'm gonna take the Too
Faced romantic I've held it I got this
off of blam bought besides one shade it
looks like whoever had this before did
not even dent this thing everything came
like super nicely bubble wrapped and
everything I did already open it just to
save time for the video but there was
like a sealant or like a plastic sheet
thing over all these as well they do
sanitize and clean everything obviously
in the upper bowl process a few people
have been asking lately for like a
purpley smokey eyes so I think we're
gonna do that I'm gonna start out with
the shade ever after which is this deep
purpley color I'm gonna take this morphe
brush I hate how they don't have numbers
on here well that kind of tuna fall
out so we're just gonna start by making
like a v-shape with this it feels so
bizarre to me to be filming at night
right now I don't think I'm gonna do
this again look I'm not in the zone I've
been really liking the dark on the
inside and outside who's gonna put this
on the inner third and outer third
basically and then leave that center
part to put the light purple
I feel like this kind of looks best when
you semi connect it just in the crease
yep so getting just connecting it in the
very crease very crease I'm just going
to take this brush which doesn't have
anything on it and just blend all right
so now we're ready to pop on that middle
color this honeymoon color doesn't look
super pigmented but we shall see
tend to fall out in the shadows like
holy crap I don't know if you guys can
see this but the purple is everywhere
I might put a lighter shade on top of
here whoo that's actually really pretty
can't judge a book by it's cover II now
actually has a nice like iridescent stew
it alright I'm gonna go on a mission to
try and find light shimmery purple
shades since they don't have a light
enough purple shade I'm gonna mix these
two NYX pigments these are each like a
dollar or two dollars or something I'll
try and figure out the shades and leave
them down below because they're not on
here I know this one is pearl
I have no idea what this one is so I'm
just gonna mix the two together and see
what happens
I just like to use the lid of a bath and
Bodyworks candle we have a lot of
everything going on here
that looks pretty this is a concoction
we have on the brush I'm just gonna
spray it with some Mario Badescu rose
water this is basically what I use now
to spray pigments when I don't want to
waste my setting spray there we go
that worked I've enough purple eyeshadow
for all of America I'm trying this new
thing where I like put away as I
use it it's been interesting so I'm
gonna go back in with the Sedona lace
pencil brush I know for and take first
dance from the palette this is like
looks pretty matte there's a little bit
sparkle in there nice deep brown color
I'm just gonna blend this on the bottom
lashline I do want this to be really
smoky so I'm bringing it pretty far in
I'm going to take the lightest shade in
this palette which is bouquet toss or
fashion there's two names I'm just gonna
put this under the brow bone I'm going
to take Urban Decay perversion which has
a 90% chance that it might break in my
eye
I totally forgot that I was in use this
brand new Milani shadow I did find the
benefit they're real push-up liner on
glambot and I'm debating whether I want
to use this in this video or save it for
a whole other video I'm kind of scared
that I'm gonna mess up my whole look if
I tried this thing right now let's try
it here goes nothing there was a phase
where I feel like my entire YouTube feed
was sponsored reviews on this product so
I'm kind of stoked to see whether it
lives up to what people were saying it
not know how to do this it's supposed to
draw an easy line smooth lash hugging
application twist the base ones to push
up the gel liner to the tip slowly glide
tip along lash line it's actually
awesome that this was brand new like in
the box from limbo what does on my nose
I think you've had a giant brush hair on
my nose this entire time yeah this is
literally brand new alright so I'm gonna
take this orange thing out let's twist
up how many times it's a twist base once
like I can't tell if there's stuff
coming out it's definitely nothing
coming out on my hand right now maybe we
have to get it going it feels super like
rubbery almost right any day now
oh here we go whoa super interesting
consistency definitely looks like a gel
hey do this I'm just gonna see what
happens
definitely doesn't like glide on and
really curious for this winged thing
because it's basically supposed to be
shaped in like the exact shape so you
can just drag it across in one swipe did
you guys see that round two okay so that
definitely is not easy
and now it looks like fun it is
really black which is nice but that wing
was like an epic fail and I don't even
know how I'm cleaning this up and I have
to do like a super intense wing I think
we're gonna do this for the base and
then ditch this thing no we're not even
doing that looking up close it looks
super chunky ladies think we're going
back in positions formula we're just
gonna have a really intense wing today
the formula of benefit is like so chunky
like I can feel it drying on my eye
weirdly alright I think these are the
most intense wings I've ever had
don't understand this I'm going with
this light shimmery shade in here and
just put this on the inner corner I feel
like I need a little black on the bottom
lash line just to even out this
intensely I'm gonna go in with just a
matte black eyeshadow this was an
unexpectedly dramatic look if you don't
feel like you want to go this dramatic
with the eyeliner black eye shadow and
stuff I feel like you could have just
stopped before the eyeliner and just put
on some falsies or mascara and some
bottom mascara and I feel like it would
look really pretty with like the purple
that's kind of what I was envisioning
but it's makeup you never know what's
gonna happen then we're gonna go in with
some mascara and then we're gonna apply
falsies the false lashes i'm gonna be
using are the red cherry 1:03 lashes i
basically gave these things like a
massive air cut I trimmed the band but I
also trimmed just like random parts to
make them look a little bit more natural
they do look pretty costumey since
they're like super long when you first
get them all right so falsies in my ski
is on her lips I think one do like a
dark nudie color Melania was super
awesome and sent me the entire new matte
color statement lipstick collection let
me know if you guys want a whole
swatches video on these or blog post or
something this shade I have been
freaking obsessed with you'll probably
see this in my favorites for the month
this is a shade 61 matte naked this is
like the perfect dark nude that I've
been searching for ignoring the shape to
work a lot and I feel like it's just
totally so pretty from glambot I got the
bomb bomb shelter lip gloss what shade
is this in in the shade dream girl ooh
this looks like a nice color and we try
to any of the bomb lip glosses before
but they are usually on hot look whoa
smells super sweet some kind of candy
but like whoa there that was like the
exact same shade or there was barely any
color payoff I think I'm gonna add
another gloss in the middle just to
lighten lighten it up a little bit I'm
gonna take the drug cosmetics butter
cream now we're talkin alright so this
is the final look if you guys liked this
video and you want more shadow entries
videos be sure to give us a thumbs up so
I know I feel like I haven't sat down
and done a shadow and schmooze in a
really freaking long time like always

below that I used on my face if you want
to see what's on my face and how I
contour and highlight for pale skin I
