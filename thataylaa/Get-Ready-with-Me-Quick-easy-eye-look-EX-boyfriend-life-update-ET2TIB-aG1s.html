 sixth sense for when I start
filming the apartment has been
completely silent all day and now the
apartment band is back all right so
today we have a shadow in schmooze on
look I'm wearing right now I'm actually
filming in my old bedroom right now I'm
doing a major room swap right now so my
old filming room the tiniest room is now
my bedroom this is just a temporary
background so I can get videos up for
you guys I just wanted to make a super
easy quick kind of look I have a couple
new products I've been really enjoying
that I want to show you guys how they
apply and look on that's what we're
doing if you want to see how I got this
look you're in the right place just keep
watching sounds like a fairly normal
intro for me alright so I am kind of all
over the place right now literally and
figuratively I'm going through a giant
room swap redo thing right now don't ask
me why I decided to do this right now
when I have like literally five thousand
other things to do but yeah I'm in my
old bedroom right now and this is super
temporary I don't even know what video
will be at first I have a room tour
coming for my old room and I also have a
vlog mentioning some of the stuff that's
going on we're just doing the shadow
entries in the middle of the living room
right now I Spit on Mac's painterly
paint-pot to prime the eyes feel like we
have a lot to chat about today I haven't
done a shadow in shmooze in a while it
feels like to start I'm going to take
the Naked 2 palette in the crease I'm
going to put T's this is pretty much
what I do every day for work all I do is
take T's and put it in the crease I like
how it's cool toned and it just gives
you nice definition without looking like
you're wearing actual like eye shadow
I'm in the middle of filming a leopard
Road blog today it is Saturday painting
furniture have to film to videos because
I'm going to be gone next week in
Southern California and have three
videos to edit today so I hope we're in
focus right now I'm still using t5i but
I focused it a different way and I don't
have it on auto focus right now I wanted
to apologize for the show that was
my hope video was that even
my 10 most repurchased drugstore makeup
items video that was quite the video
some of you guys didn't mind the focus
noise some of you like couldn't watch it
which I totally understand I have
literally one day throughout the week
that I can film so I didn't want to not
have a video for you guys so that's what
happened there we're going to go in with
the sololift palette and I really love
the story behind this palette first of
all before we tell the story look at
these shades these are so beautiful my
favorite one is this shade right here
which is called Natalia I actually have
it on my cheekbones right now I've been
using it every single day as a highlight
and it is so freakin pretty is probably
the most like natural looking highlight
I've used on my face before and it's
just such a pretty shade I think we're
going to start out with a darker shade
and then take my E bo9 brush by Sedona
lace we're going to take Fleur
I'm going to top off the brush because
we do get a little bit of Fallout so
basically they came out with this
palette as a way to thank instagramers
for the support of their brand and I
think that's so awesome and so unique
and they basically have all these
instagramers names right here I feel
like that is a brand who actually
appreciates influencers and bloggers and
I just thought that was awesome so I
don't really know what I'm doing right
now I'm just kind of just kind of going
I'm putting this mostly in the outer
third and then bringing it slightly not
slightly all the way in on the to the
inner corner but just keeping that in
the crease I've been liking the look of
kind of dark on the inner and outer and
then the light color in the middle to
make it kind of pop this isn't going to
be like a super special revolutionary
look for anything it's going to be basic
I almost never have a plan for the look
I'm doing and if I do it rarely turns
out how I actually pictured it and
sometimes it's good and sometimes you
learn I have so many videos that I have
to get up that I've been promising for a
while I have the NARS foundation review
coming the Beca one I don't know if I'm
going to do a full review on just
because it's it's so dark on my skin
that I can't even test it out by itself
I've been mixing it in and I'm still not
that much of a fan I think I'm going to
end up returning the Becca foundation
all right I think we're just going to
take that same brush and bring it down
slang actually we're not gonna give that
brush I'm going to take my student Elise
9:04 brush this is my favorite brush for
the lower lash line I'm actually going
to combine what floor and aerial which
is this gold shade and just see what
happens
like it also have planning videos coming
it's all coming guys last weekend I
actually had one of my really good
friends come and visit and stay with me
in Seattle so I wasn't on my normal like
filming schedule so that's kind of why
last week or whenever I'm you know when
you're watching this all the videos have
been like pushed back what is in my
eyeballs right now I'm gonna take
Natalia on my finger and put this on the
center oh my gosh do we see that we
ended up going to the above-and-beyond
concert in Tacoma which was freaking
amazing I've been trying to see above
and beyond for literally two years it
was just amazing to come was interesting
Tacoma kind of feels like Reno if you've
ever been to Reno I was blending that in
a little bit it's like gonna be the
quickest outlook of all time I think
we're also gonna put this are we know
that's all we're gonna do with the eye
shadow I just want to do like a quick
easy kind of look that you guys can
easily recreate something is seriously
in my eyeball so I don't have drawers in
this desk right now so let's go get my
eyeliner god I actually have a chair
right now so I'm just going to take a
black eyeliner and put this on the
waterline lashes I'm going to be using
are the Ardell 102 dummies it kind of
trimmed these down a lot I think what
should we talk about I feel like I have
so much that I don't even know where to
start work I don't want to talk about
work if you followed I wasn't even
planning out talking about this but I
might as well because it's the shadow
mushroom if any of you have been
following me for a couple years my best
friend at the time who we dated for
three years and we actually filmed an
ex-boyfriend tag video I don't even know
if it's still up we had a little
following out which I'm not going to go
into but we started talking again and
he's actually coming to see me in
Seattle in a couple weeks so I'm super
happy about that it's always nice when
people come back into your life
I think both of us feel really thankful
and that we're able to still be friends
that's in a couple weeks I'm also going
to Southern California I don't even know
if I mention that going to Southern
California my brain right now is like in
25 different
countries I just really desperately need
a vacation even though this isn't really
a vacation I'm only going to Southern
California for a weekend I really just
need to get out of Seattle for a bit and
relax and like not check emails and not
do work I'm going to try and get videos
pre-recorded and edited and everything
for you guys I'm doing my best look at
those lashes these are just perfect by
the way on my face I mentioned it in the
blog that I'm filming today but I'm
wearing the Revlon Colorstay mixed in
with Estee Lauder but I didn't do it on
camera because it was literally like
hours ago and I had to go run errands
and stuff I've been completely in love
with the Maybelline fit me concealer I
don't know why the heck I haven't been
using that for the last like my entire
life it is an awesome affordable
concealer if you're looking for one it
isn't super light if you have pale skin
but for me it's doable because I use the
Physicians Formula powder over top that
is like really light I wish I could just
film in here like it looks kind of
normal by the way all my nails right now
is a Sally Hansen I think it's called
Pacific blue like always such a relief
after your eyelashes are on you know I'm
going with the Maybelline lash
sensational which has been my favorite
mascara for a while now and just pop it
on last step for the eyes we're going to
take my favorite bottom lash mascara and
just obviously put some bottom so the
eyes are done I'm going to take I don't
even know what shade yet I got these
three lip products from la splash and
I've seen a ton of posts and stuff with
these on Instagram and they're liquid
lipsticks that are kind of like all the
rage right now and I got three shades i
swatched all these on my Instagram I've
tried one of these on my lips and it
literally did not budge I got to scrub
it off at the end of the night but these
shades and everything are like exactly
exactly what I was looking for
let's take love good like I've take up
I'm not going to use a liner with these
because I don't know I didn't the first
time it is fine
you feel a lot more like lightweight
than the Stila stay all day liquid
lipsticks definitely not as creamy they
feel very liquidy you guys always ask
how I apply lipstick with the lip ring
I literally just move it around really
complex and then when it's still wet the
formula I'll just go ahead and wipe it
off the silver part when they're drying
they feel a tiny bit sticky and then
it'll just completely be dry all of a
sudden strange not make any sense all
right so here is the final look super
easy simple is probably one of my
easiest tutorials or whatever shadow
instruments I've done these are pretty
neutral common shade so you can use any
similar ones that you have I know
Maybelline makes a really good palette
with the similar things not the nude
mattes but it's actually like a pretty
old palette I am obsessed with these lip
tints if you have dry lips these
probably aren't for you because they
feel a little bit drying but they last
forever I'm all about the long-lasting
lip products if you guys liked this
video and you want more shadow and
schmooze videos give it a thumbs up so I
know I know is it true we're good love
you guys thanks for watching see you my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
