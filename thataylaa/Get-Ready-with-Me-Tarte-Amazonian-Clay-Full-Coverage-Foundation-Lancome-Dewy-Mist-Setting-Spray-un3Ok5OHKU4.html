ready with me video on the look I'm
wearing right now I did pretty much my
everyday eye routine using the revealed
2 palette and then I also used my
everyday lip color that I've been
reaching for I'm working my ass off to
get videos ready for you guys for like
the next two weeks so you're not stuck
stranded without videos so thank you to
everyone who's been commenting noticing
that it really means a lot to me and you
guys are awesome trying out the new
tarte amazonian not new new to me
the Terra Amazonian clay full coverage
foundation and some other good so
if you want to see this look then just
keep watching
alright so I've already well my voice
just sounded super deep what's going on
right now alright so I already
moisturized my face with my polish twice
moisturizer and then applied benefit
Porefessional as my primer definitely
should have had more coffee so about a
week ago I ordered the Tarte Amazonian
clay full coverage foundation I haven't
used it in a video before I've used it
about three times and I don't know mixed
feelings I think I'm just not applying
it the best way I've been using my Sigma
f80 which needs to be washed but today
I'm going to try it with my Real
Techniques makeup complexion miracle
complexion sponge whatever it's called
I do have the lightest shade and it's
still a little bit too yellowy and dark
so to neutralize that and lighten it a
little bit and using my Manic Panic
dreamtone Holy Grail product for me
lightens your foundation neutralizes
yellow whatever you want so I'm just
going to put some of this on the back of
my hand and then mix in a pump of the
Manic Panic
alright so now I'm just going in with my
sponge to let's see how this applies
all right so already I like that way
better than how it looks when I use a
brush with it it is a really thick
foundation and it definitely has a matte
finish which I don't mind a good matte
foundation every once in a while but I
don't know lately I've been feeling the
doing this you know I've kind of been
trying to branch into the high-end
foundation world just because they do
have a bigger range of fair shades
usually I just want to try out a few
different one three guys if you saw in
my last shadow in this video I used my
Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation so
if you want to see how that wears and
how I like it then you can watch that
video I'm definitely going to have to go
in with a thin second layer because this
definitely is a full coverage on me
right now like I said I've worn this
foundation a few times now I don't
really think it's that amazing I think I
have a lot better drugstore foundations
like my Revlon Colorstay and I don't
think it lasts 12 hours the first day I
wore it I wore without a powder because
it did feel really thick it started
getting oily about five hours in oh no
I'm still deciding whether or not I want
to keep this foundation just because it
is like 30 or 40 dollars and if I'm not
in love with it then return it keep your
receipts ladies so if you saw my last
shadow insurance video which I actually
recorded yesterday um but I'm still
packing up everything I have literally
five hours to get all my together
and why I'm filming right now all of my
makeup that I have to use right now is
in this little bag we have limited
supplies if I'm using some of the same
things that's why so for concealer I'm
using my two favorite concealers lately
then to set my under eye concealer I'm
using my obsessions formula translucent
powder let me know if you guys want me
to just fast-forward through the
concealer and powder part or not show it
because I literally do the same thing in
every shadow in shmooze video because
that's just how I like to do my
concealer but then again there's many
people watching every time so I don't
know let me know what you guys think I
still don't know if I want to do a
powder with this foundation it looks
pretty heavy right now so I'm kind of on
the fence about it I think I'm just
gonna do a light dusting I use my Laura
Geller powder my Real Techniques brush
and just do a really light coat coat so
for blush I'm going to use my tar
Amazonian clay blush and Dollface I
mentioned this in my June raves and
rejects video when I don't want to like
think about my blush and I just want it
on my face this is pretty much what I
use and I'm going in with my morphe
stippling brush definitely still have
hair dye right there then for a little
luminosity I love that word I'm going to
go in with my bare minerals at ready
color boost powder in the endless
celebration I've been obsessed with this
stuff alright we've got the brows on I
think for setting spray where did I just
pick up and it's in the laundry room for
setting spray I'm going to try out a new
one this is the Lancome dewy mist spray
and it's supposed to be a smoothing
radiance enhancer it says it's also a
setting spray to set your makeup you can
use it before or after more both
whatever you're feeling I went to a
makeup CCO in Southern California when I
was there and I this usually retails for
thirty seven dollars like what the
they had it for thirty-one and then it
was half price at so I basically got it
for $15 I'm kind of a setting spray
hoarder I have like ten I love them so I
use this one time before my only
thoughts on it was that it feels like a
freaking fire hose spraying on your face
and it smells really strong it chemicals
and just cut it grass but if you can
overlook that as you think it gives you
a nice glow I'll see if you Vince I kind
of want to see if this top fits on there
because then I wouldn't have a bruise
every time I spray it on my face alright
this is an epic fail definitely doesn't
fit on there let's do this kind of
scared I can't do it Taylor
one do
oh it smells so bad mmm all right better
be worth it because it smells like ass
it definitely does help to do you up a
little bit though this side is all dry
and look how Judy looks looks really
nice actually yeah okay alright so for
eyes I'm going to be using Urban Decay
primer potion just cuz this is what I
have in my travel bag so my mom is
coming up tonight that's why I have five
hours to get my together we're
renting a u-haul and driving up to
Seattle tomorrow on the first so when
you're watching this it will probably be
like a week later I'm super excited kind
of just hit me like yesterday it's
really sad to leave your college town or
for me it is I had a really great
college experience so it's kind of weird
like starting this whole new life
basically but I'm really excited at the
same time so my Sigma e-40 brush which
is like my holy grail blending brush is
packed away I don't know how that
happened but we don't have it so I'm
just using these random brushes right
now I think I'm going to use the
revealed 2 palette actually I don't know
reel to palette or is Judas time those
are the only ones I have right now then
I'm going to use reveal too because I
used as Judy's time in my last shoud
wrench moves I think we're just going to
do my everyday matte smokey eye that
I've been doing lately because why not
haven't done it yet oh maybe I should
tell you what I'm doing this color right
here in the crease I have a whole review
on the revealed 2 palette if you want to
see it curious to see how this look is
going to go without a blending brush but
remember that tag that was going around
like a year ago or more that was the no
brush makeup challenge or whatever I
don't want to do that face is definitely
doable eyes the challenge I just hit
30,000 subscribers last night and I'm so
excited and thankful for all of you and
all of your support and everything I've
been trying my best to upload three
times a week for you guys and keep them
coming while I'm moving and everything
so all of your nice comments and words
of support and encouragement really do
mean a lot to me love you guys so then
I'm going to take this matte shade right
here it's like a light pink kind of
cream shade and I'm just using my
fingers for my lid color like I always
do so then I'm going to use my favorite
color in the palette which is this brown
shade which is pretty much an exact dupe
for Mac and Bart
I just like to plot this on the outer
corner this is literally what I've been
doing every day if I'm actually going
somewhere I just drag this about a third
of the way in and then kind of blend it
together with that cream color so then I
think I'm going to add a little bit of
color why not I'm gonna use this matte
red shade I'm going to run this on my
bottom lash line just on the outer third
then I'm going to take that brown shade
again and just do a little bit on the
outer portion of my eye and there we go
can you guess what I'm using Physicians
Formula I booster pen this just gives
you a super quick easy wing or whatever
you want to do so for mascaras I'm going
to use Mac prep and from someone
actually just tweeted me that they got
this let's just see who it is will give
you a shout out selina XO just tweeted
that try to reply to every single tweet
so if you're not following me on Twitter
you go do that we can talk the first few
times I used a mascara primer I didn't
notice a difference but once it really
liked conditions your lashes I can't go
without this stuff literally was
actually putting this on at home and mom
was like white mascara is that a new
trend she's so cute so then I'm gonna
use Maybelline falsies I'm gonna go in
with my L'Oreal miss manga mascara
because that policies is literally empty
I'm really not a fan of this whole bendy
thing I'm gonna try and put the falsies
top on top of this and see what happens
ooh I think I'm just gonna keep both and
just dip my falsies brush into that
formula I love speed I think I'm going
to add a little bit of this white
shimmer shade to my inner corner just
brighten things up a little I'm using
the same brush that I used on the bottom
lash line this is the Sigma e30 pencil
brush for lips I'm going to use the
Stila stay all day liquid lipstick in
patina I've mentioned this where is
their hair on my arm I mention this in
my June raves and rejects video as well
as on Instagram a few times but never
actually worn it in a video before and
by the way I just got this lip ring
yesterday of course my stud came out
while I was packing so I'm literally
having no idea where it is
those things cost like $40 so I went to
the place last night and this one was
only 14 so I was like sure I'll do whoo
anyways have them put on lipstick with
it on yet so we'll see how this goes
I know I'm not supposed to get on the
hoot that works and let it dry so here
is the final look nothing too crazy but
it's just been what I've been wearing if
you guys like shout on Schmidt's videos
be sure to give this video a thumbs up
so I know comment down below with what
your favorite everyday lip color is
because I want to know love you guys
thanks for watching see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
