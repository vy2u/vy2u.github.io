caramel alright so today we have a
shadow move so I'm gonna look I'm
wearing right now it happened again I
think it's been the same amount of money
every month on my rent as I do in glam
but so a lot of the products I use in
this video are from glam bought I've
talked about glam buck before because I
freaking love them but but if you don't
know it's basically a site where you can
get super markdown gently use makeup I
signed up for their email newsletters
because then you get alerted when
there's sales last night there was an
80% off all makeup sale took everything
in me to resist the items on there sell
out super fast like you can literally be
shopping around and have something in
your cart and then when you go to buy it
it's gone so as soon as you get one of
their emails I would hop on there are
some insane deals on there I tried out a
new BB cream the lumen a BB cream so you
can see how it looks and applies on my
face I also use the Too Faced chocolate
bar palette in this video for the first
time ever yeah so if you want to see how
I got this look you're in the right
place just keep watching
alright I'm super excited for this video
because glambot happened again I've
already primed my face I use the Make Up
For Ever HD primer this is ginormous
this would literally take me my whole
life
to finish all the stuff I'm using today
is pretty much from glambot it's
supposed to be a red canceling primer
because it's green you know it smells
like honeydew mixed with medicine really
strong smell I was not a fan of the
smell at all
I don't know how much red canceling it
did I've gotten a lot of questions on my
skin lately because if you've been
watching me for a while it has like
massively cleared up in the last couple
months this is basically all scarring
now I'm gonna be filming a skincare
routine coming up very soon so if you're
following me on Instagram I posted about
these this is why I went on glambot in
the first place I saw the Make Up For
Ever chromatic I think they're called
chromatic what is this chromatic mix and
they're basically white pigment drops to
lighten your foundation this is
obviously a little pricier than my Holy
Grail Manic Panic dreamtone but I wanted
to try these out it says it's an oil
base so I'm assuming you shouldn't mix
this with a water-based foundation I'm
hoping that this is an oil-based it
doesn't say this is oil-free so we're
gonna try it out this is the
lumen a BB cream from the drugstore you
can get this at CVS one of you guys
actually recommended this to me on its
own this is way too dark for me but I've
mixed it in with a couple different
things and I really liked the
consistency of it it gives you a super
natural skin like kind of finish and it
has pretty decent coverage so we're
gonna see how it mixes with this bad boy
and this was like $12 on glambot was a
freaking score
sounds like there's nothing in here I
put a little bit of that BB cream on the
back of my palate I'm gonna start out
with whoa this is like a really thick
kind of drop so I'm just gonna do a tiny
bit at first and see what color we get
okay that wasn't not enough this is a
really awkward way to squeeze to the
bottle Taylor what are you doing it's
not as pigmented as I was expecting when
try again I'm using a lot at this point
if you like definitely not as pigmented
as Manic Panic dreamtone you could put
like one pump of that in and this would
be light enough so let's just see what
kind of thing we're getting right now I
just like to dab it on my face and I'm
trying out the morphe mb8 foundation
brush I haven't used this before I love
the finish of this BB cream it literally
just looks like skin or like you have on
like a lotion or something if you just
want something light for the summer but
that has coverage so there we have one
layer I'm gonna go in to the other side
and then we'll do a second layer I've
already used up pretty much everything
on the palette so I definitely had to
use a lot of that make up forevers stuff
both times into where the BB cream I
haven't noticed that it broke me out
which is good yeah I think I just
literally used half the bottle of this
makeup forever stuff
well there goes an earring things are
freakin canon he has to get in I'm
liking this brush so far I'm thinking
about trying out the makeup geek
foundation brush let me know what you
guys think of that with down below if
you've tried it so I'm gonna go in with
whatever is leftover on the palette and
we're just gonna kind of spot conceal
and go over any parts that need a little
bit more coverage and see if it's
buildable I swear I can still smell that
primer kind of things do you want
honeydew right now I'm making even fruit
and like way too long mmm healthy things
I'm back doing Jillian Michaels I just
feel so much better when I work out but
it's like I'm either like an
all-or-nothing kind of person so I feel
like as soon as they stop working out
for a little bit I get out of the out of
the routine but we're back I just used
the YouTube video it's completely free
you don't you have to buy the DVD or
anything
gotta love Jillian what do you think
Jillian Michaels is doing right now
let's see how this is looking
it looks beautiful I love the finish of
this it's like dewy but it looks
completely like you just have sunscreen
on or something doesn't even look like
there's product on my face so concealer
we're just gonna go in with my favorite
Urban Decay Naked skin I actually don't
think it's possible to invent a better
concealer this is like everything I've
ever wanted in one just feels super
moisturizing but light and full coverage
and amazing what did I wear yesterday
whatever I wear yesterday
I've got a few popping up right here to
set the under-eye nothing new I've been
using this it cosmetics brush lately and
it just works great for right here it's
super dense and it just gives good
coverage I'm going to put a tiny bit of
this in the center of my forehead since
it is a bit dewy right there all right
so for bronzer I'm finally trying out
the hoola bronzer by benefit this was
one glambot and it was super cheap I
think this was one of the like 80% off
things I literally put this in my car
and checked out and then came back to
shop because things I'm going bought
sell out so fast got to do what you got
to do so it still has the brush too
which is pretty good it looks like it's
never been used
feels kind of like okay so I'm gonna go
in with my normal brush that I use for
contouring and bronzing whoa
okay that was way more pigmented than I
expected so we're just gonna blend a
little bit apparently we're having an
intense contour today and put a little
bit on my temples and maybe let's do the
double chin I'm just gonna go over that
with a blank curette empty powder brush
just to kind of tone it down a little I
actually really like the tone of that
though it looks really nice I'm gonna
pop on the brows really quick and then
we're gonna come back for everything
else you just press a button and your
brows would be done that would be the
greatest invention ever
so my brows are on we're gonna do I
think like a purple smokey kind of Iowa
as I saw this so I'm Glenn Bhat so Laura
Mercier cream eye color and the swatches
on Google looked kind of cool but
basically just a cream shadow I'm gonna
put this on the eyes and let it kind of
set and then we're gonna do blush and
highlight and everything I'm just
putting this all over the lid kind of as
a base and we're gonna blend this out so
it's okay if the edges aren't perfect
for highlight I'm gonna go in with my
Mac soft and gentle I also got this of a
gland bought a while ago I've been
literally using this every single day I
feel like I can't use a different
highlight right now I just love the way
that it looks like look at that it just
literally looks like your face is
glowing not like you have a product on
it I'm going with this blush called
gypsy by Becca cosmetics I've heard a
lot of good things about Becca cosmetics
lately like they're highlighters and
stuff if you like I need to try some out
glides on super pretty there's
definitely like a sheen to this I'm
gonna go in with my Too Faced chocolate
bar palette this is the first time I'm
ever using this I'm super freaking
excited because it smells amazing I
think it smells like marshmallows not
really chocolate there's some super
pretty purple shades in here
I feel like this palette is like super
hyped up so I'm excited to finally try
it why is there lipstick on
blending brush awesome I'm going with a
shade salted caramel for the crease and
it looks like a nice warm crease color
oh yeah
maybe I should assume you guys in never
I zoom in it my head is out of the frame
so I just have to like sit on half the
chair no my back falls asleep this shade
is like perfect for the crease has a
perfect amount of warmth and it blends
out super easily instead the Laura
Mercier if you don't have that you could
also use one of Maybelline's color
tattoos coffee break Cheers I feel like
my skin looks so smooth right now I
really like that BB cream let's do
cherry cordial or do I love this camera
but the internal temp gets too hot like
every two seconds so I have to turn it
off um what were you doing I'm just
gonna put this on the outer corner and
probably the inner corner these shadows
kind of reminds me of the revealed 2
palette like they're super pigmented but
they're also really easy to blend out
which isn't really nice a pop a little
bit of this on the inner part really the
center of our eye pretty pretty blank
all right now I'm gonna take marzipan on
my finger oh this was so buttery that
just felt amazing this looks really
pretty I'm excited and we're just gonna
put this on the center of the eye hell
yeah
it almost looks rose gold with the
purple let's go in with that same empty
brush and kind of empty a blank brush
with that product then on that same
brush I'm gonna go back in with salted
caramel that we started to it you just
blend a tiny bit of this right in the
crease again I'm just gonna put it tiny
bit more right in the center I can't
find my favorite I don't know lace eye
pencil brush so we're gonna go in with
this one what is on here I went to excel
to caramel again and just put this on
the bottom lash line and I'm gonna pop a
tiny bit of marzipan
right in the center on the bottom lash
line I'm going to take champagne truffle
which is this like beautiful light pink
shimmery
on the inner corner oh hell yeah I'm
also gonna put tiny bit of that on my
Cupid's bow I'm liking these I packed
away like 3/4 of my makeup because I'm
going to be moving apartments and which
I mentioned in a video I don't know if
this one will be up first so I just
grabbed whatever brown eyeliner I could
find this is the Sephora brand
waterproof liner angled pencil brush and
we're gonna add some depth to this we're
gonna go in with triple fudge kind of
blend out that waterline I also got the
semi-sweet palette so let me know if you
guys would want to see you look using
that as well but back in with salted
caramel on that same brush and blend
right underneath where we just applied
the brown alright so since we're pretty
bottom heavy right now I'm gonna go in
with some eyeliner there it is
I use the essence 2 and white in one of
my last videos I think this one will
actually be at first actually like this
for making the wing it's not my like new
everyday favorite I'm still in love with
my Physicians Formula i booster but this
one is not not bad essence so I'm gonna
go into the thin side and just create a
wing this one does look really really
matte just easy to create like a really
intense wing with this cuz it has a fine
point and it's pretty firm too
I'm gonna go in with a tiny bit of
concealer just to clean up the line on
this one a little bit like this one
looks longer yep I'm gonna play a I feel
like I'm forgetting something
no apply a thin coat of mascara and then
we're gonna go in with falsies ivory
fallen in love with the Maybelline
falsies mascara when I use this thing
like right now I'm just doing a quick
coat but when I actually do this thing
and like curl it and go to town it does
look like you're kind of wearing false
lashes I just applied my falsies I'm
wearing we're gonna just put the case up
on the chair I'm wearing the Kara lashes
s4 and these are from shop miss adore
shot miss a whatever older lash
are only a dollar which is a really good
deal everyone I have tried so far I've
really enjoyed then I went over the band
with the thick side of the essence liner
put some mascara on to blend in the
falsies now I'm gonna go in with my Wet
n Wild mega length for the bottom lashes
like always
alright the eyeballs are done I got the
Bobbi Brown lipstick in warm nude it's a
creamy matte lipstick and ooh I thought
was magnetic this looks like a really
pretty color I'm gonna swatch this that
looks nice I don't know if I'm feeling
like the nude with this I kind of wanted
to do like either a light pink lip or a
purple dark purple lip totally forgot to
use this this is a Tarte musique stain I
think they actually threw this thing
that's like a freebie because I feel
like I wouldn't have ordered a cheek
stain packaging of this is super cute I
also got the we're doing a mini haul
right now apparently Tarte mares yuka
oil I've heard good things about this
I've been wanting to try out different
face oils lately anyways that was a
whole I think we're gonna start out with
this NYX liner in the shade mauve let's
just line these things after using
essence liners this one does not feel
that's nice then we're gonna go in with
this Jordana twist and shine says it's a
moisturizing balm stain in the shade
gorgeous peony I can't remember if I
like this color or not so we'll see boo
that's actually really pretty actually
like that combo I feel like it's a nice
mod but like not a mauve and your face
kind of mom a little bit of purple this
is lilac petal my last pesto you need a
magnifying glass to read it I hope they
still make this this is from like years
ago
it's just a nice purpley kind of gloss
and I had my teeth
you don't want it enough close and
personal all right so this is the final
look I really like this chocolate bar
palette I feel like I could just take
off my makeup right now and just like
play with this for hours if you guys
like this video and you want more shadow
and schmooze give it give me give you
those videos give it a thumbs up so I
know again I'll have all the products
