shadow and schmooze I did a whole video
on my face makeup and now we're doing
the eyes and the rest of the face so
here we go if you missed that first
video I'll leave it down below or you
can click right here and watch that
first I wanted to do kind of like a
greeny gold smokey eye thing all the
products used will be listed down below
like always and if you want to see this
look you're in the right place just keep
watching all right so my face and brows
are clearly done I'm liking it got a
nice full coverage thing going on so I'm
thinking I want to do like a green
smokey eye I don't know we'll see what
happens so I'm going to take Mac's Paint
Pot and genuine treasure this is a
gorgeous like greeny gold Paint Pot and
it's just basically a cream eyeshadow
that's great for priming your eyes since
this does have color to it I'm not
taking it up to the brow bone so if I
kind of like the matte blending colors
and crease colors for this look I'm
gonna be taking the ish Judy's time
palette I'm pretty sure this is sold out
on BH Cosmetics but I did see it on
Zulily the other day
I'm freaking obsessed with zhu-li I
literally just discovered it last week
and it is amazing I did like all of my
holiday shopping on there it's kind of
like hot looked like they have a flash
sale thing going on
they have incredible prices and just a
 ton of different stuff if you
haven't heard absolutely I'll link it
down below but anyways long story short
pretty sure this pallets Jonesy Lilly
when I'm filming this it is anyways I
deep cleaned all of my brushes this week
and like half of them somehow magically
disappeared don't know where my favorite
Sedona lace blending brush is I'm just
gonna take this thing this is the
six-plus brush I think this is from eBay
I'm just taking this second shade over
that one and we're just gonna blend this
into the crease so if you missed my part
one basically recording I should tell my
videos today to get up for you guys
because I work and then I like to go
home for the holidays try not to leave
you guys hanging what do you guys think
about this nail polish side note it kind
of reminds me like exactly of the Kylie
our lip just a nail polish form it's the
Sally Hansen nail polish in so much pawn
FA WN they'll posh names crack me up
like that would be such a fun job all
right I'm torn between like three
different greenish colors I could use I
think I'm gonna use the Milani eyeshadow
in Bella emerald they sent out literally
the entire collection as like PR
packages to youtubers some bloggers
there's like 30 frickin shades and so
far the ones I've tried are really
pretty so I'm just gonna take my finger
look at that Pat the song I'm just
putting this all over the lid and then
we're gonna add another color on top of
it I'm gonna go back over with that it's
Judy's time color and just blend it did
have a little bit of fallout but it's
okay
this eye is always shaped so weird that
it looks like I don't get the color up
here but it totally is does anyone else
have that issue then I'm gonna go in
with makeup geek utopia which is like
just an indescribable color it's so
pretty it is one of their loose pigments
so I'm just gonna put a little bit in
the cap and then we're gonna spray this
with some setting spray you can also use
water but this is just easier right now
I just use this in a look I can't
remember so freakin pretty should I say
you guys in you should alright here we
go
all right so next I want to take this
like warm ground color right here from
the is GUI palette is this probably my
favorite shade in the palette you guys
know I'm all about the web Browns and I
was taking that on my Sedona lace Evo 9
brush so I'm just gonna put this on the
outer V and then blend upwards a little
bit kind of feel like a tree right now
so I was gonna turn my brush and
slightly blend we're gonna blend this
out afterwards so don't even worry
alright so I'm just gonna take a clean
blending brush and just go to town with
the blending right now now I'm gonna go
in with that lighter shade and this is
just like a matte cream shade and put
this under the brow bone I'm also kind
of just cleaning up the edges with this
I just went back and added a little bit
more utopia just because some of it got
blended away so now I'm gonna go in with
the first shade that we started with and
blend the bottom lashline and I'm just
gonna go ahead and apply my physicians
formula eye booster eyeliner you guys
know I'm obsessed with this stuff this
isn't a shade ultra black make sure you
get ultra black not just black because
I've heard there's a difference
so fast I did kind of overdraw like how
far I brought the wing out because it
makes your eyes look bigger and we're
gonna add some water line one line we're
now at some black eyeliner to the
waterline so that will help kind of tie
everything together so I'm use some
Urban Decay eyeliner in perversion this
is just a black eyeliner with the
waterline I'm gonna blend out the bottom
lash line just a little bit more with
that warm brown shade again for the
inner corner I'm gonna add a little bit
of the shimmery white shade for my
Physicians Formula shimmer brick thing
and just pluck this right there I'm also
gonna put this on my Cupid's bow
time for some falsies I'm going to use
these kiss true volume in ritzy I don't
know I've never used these before I
think they were like on sale at
Walgreens or something yeah so I'm gonna
put these on along with some bottom
mascara and we'll be right back so
falsies and bottom mascaras on these
look a little more and natural than I
was expecting just give this some like
natural length but nothing too crazy
I'll show you guys from the side don't
know if you can see that definitely more
than exercise to me it's like come in
and wear falsies I kind of want to just
go all-out for lips I'm going to use
Stila stay all day liquid lipstick and
Catina this is like one of my Holy Grail
lip products when I go out on the
weekend this is pretty much what I wear
like 99% of the time just like the
perfect red shade where it's not too
much but it stays on literally all night
I never realized it smooth I've heard
that the Sephora liquid lipsticks I
think they're like the stay the matte
lip creams or whatever I've heard that
those are also amazing I need to order
some of those and this thing smells like
cake can't go wrong alright so this is
the final look if you guys liked this
video and you want more shouting shmoo
so you guys give it a thumbs up so I
know again if you want to see my face
makeup there's a part one that I will
leave down below along with all the
products I used and all that good stuff
I don't know when this video will be up
but I hope you all have an amazing
Hanukkah or Christmas or whatever you
celebrate and take a break I think we
all need a break Friday to break
love you guys thanks for watching and
see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
