because we're gonna be talking all about
permanent eyebrows isn't it a good day
when you can just sit and talk about
eyebrows for 20 minutes so I just filmed
a video on this look and I also did like
a try on whole kind of thing which is
why we're in the living room right now
so if you guys follow me on Instagram or
Twitter you kind of already heard me
talking about this but I got permanent
eyebrows when I was in San Diego I've
been looking into this for a bit now
when I get an idea that I want to do
something I just hardcore like research
it and get really into it and then I
just do it so that's kind of what
happened with this so permanent makeup I
feel like there's this whole like taboo
kind of around permanent eyebrows under
the right artists they can look exactly
like brushstrokes and look super natural
even if you don't want your full brows
filled in you can get like a baseline
going so if you don't have enough brush
like go out to the grocery store with
you can just get the actual shape that
you want and then still fill them in if
you want to or you can go all out and
just get them fully done so permanent
brows depending on how you take care of
them and just your skin and everything
can last between three and five years
five years is definitely on the longer
end from what I've heard so you might be
thinking how is it a tattoo that doesn't
last forever which is exactly what I was
thinking
visual body tattoos do fade just at a
slower rate going on your face is a lot
thinner than your body skin which
affects the color retention also you're
getting UV rays on your face from being
outside
there's cell turnover anti-aging
products that you put on your face a lot
of things influence how long brows are
going to stay on your face like a normal
tattoo you do want to go in for
touch-ups most places have you going for
touch-ups anywhere from a couple weeks
to sixty days from when you first got it
done
so if you're considering getting your
permanent brows done my best advice to
you is to hardcore do your research on
who you want the artist to be when I
started looking for people in Seattle I
just wasn't finding any artists that
were doing brows that was what I was
looking for I was really looking for
natural-looking brush strokes I just
looked like hairs also looking at
whether or not the artist can do more
than one shape a lot of the times and I
think this happens when you get your
brows waxed too people have an idea of
what they think a brow should look like
but if you can't listen to what your
client is saying and do what they want
then I don't want you to be putting my
brows on my face for the rest of my life
so I knew I was already going to be
going to San Diego to visit my family so
I ended up looking at tattoo artists
there so I came across Carrie who I
found on Yelp and she's the owner of
fine line Studios in Pacific Beach which
is in San Diego looking at all of her
photos on Yelp and I just liked the way
that she did brush strokes and she also
had like a variation of different brows
she has a ton of before pictures on Yelp
and Instagram I'm going to leave all her
information and description box below I
highly recommend Keri I'm going to go
more in depth about my experience there
and I actually blogged the whole thing
so you guys will actually be able to see
footage there and see what she's doing
but right off the bat if you're in
California or if you're going to be
traveling there soon
make the trip to go see Keri and because
hands down it was the best experience I
could have asked for
so since I'm not in San Diego Keri and I
got on the phone she did like a
consultation with me I sent her photos
of the kind of brows that I was going
for I wanted more of like a rounded
shape my right eyebrow right now is
exactly what I was envisioning when I go
back for touch-ups we're going to fill
in at the left one a little bit more
like everyone says eyebrows our sister's
not twins I'm gonna show you guys a shot
right now of the before so I'm getting
ready right now to go get my eyebrows
tattooed I am so excited here's my brows
before this is what my eyebrows looked
like before as you can see my right brow
pretty much ended about halfway through
I was never really satisfied with the
shape of my brow so I knew that I want
to fix it up and kind of get the look
that I was going for this whole time
I do have naturally light brown
strawberry blonde hair but my eyebrows
are naturally dark which is a little
strange you can go back and watch my
videos to see how my brows look when I
used to fill them in and kind of more
before now when I got to the studio it
was totally different than I was
envisioning not that I was envisioning
like a shitty tattoo parlor but this
place is like a it kinda looks like
you're about to get a massage like it
looks very clean very sanitary
everything is laid out super
professional-looking I just really
appreciated this space it made me feel
like relaxed and she had music going on
so first we sat down I took off all my
brow makeup you can keep the rest of
your makeup on if you want to or if you
just go no makeup on but we just removed
all the makeup off my brows you can see
my actual brow here then what we did
first was let's choose the color of the
pigment that I was going for so I told
her that I wanted no warmth to it I
don't like warm brown tones I wanted
basically my natural color which is
exactly what it actually faded to she
can mix different pigments to get the
exact tone that you want and then she
basically would just test it out by
putting like a cotton swab on your
eyebrow so you can see what it's going
to look like against your skin so once
the color is picked then we went on to
the shape so she used a pencil to just
pencil in the shape that I was going for
based on the photos that I sent her she
was super cool with wiping everything
off a few times and trying again to get
the exact shape that I wanted my best
advice for you is to be super open and
communicate with the person that's doing
your brows because at the end of the day
these are going to be on your face for
the next five years and you want to be
happy with them so be as open and blunt
as possible she wants to make you happy
and give you brows that you're going to
love so don't be afraid to share what
you're thinking so once we nail down the
shape we were good to go so that whole
process took about an hour
the entire thing takes about two to
three hours depending on how long your
consultation takes basically I think I
was only laying on the table for about
an hour to an hour and a half
configuration it's 12 tiny little
needles and it just goes in a nervous
like exacto knife looking thing and then
I just hold it like a pencil so it kind
of meets your skin at about a 45 degree
angle and it's just kind of a little
scratch like that a lot of people on
snapchat and Twitter were asking me
whether or not it hurt and I feel like I
have a pretty high pain tolerance so the
first pass that she has to go through
that one literally just felt like a
little more intense version of plucking
eyebrows I think for me it was like as
long as I wasn't thinking about it I
couldn't see any of the tools my eyes
were closed I was just listening to
music and we were talking she's really
good at like keeping you relaxed and
like not thinking about everything so to
me it really didn't hurt at all I
literally just felt like plucking
eyebrows once she does that first pass
then she can actually put on numbing
cream which was fucking amazing I
literally didn't feel anything after
that she put on the numbing cream and
then would continue on for the rest of
the hour and I couldn't feel anything if
you're worried about the pain seriously
don't
oh wow crazy they literally look like
hair sure I know look here look here
tasty Wow Harry looks so good so here's
what my brows looks like the day after I
got them done as you can see they're a
little bit darker than they are right
now because the first five days after
you get your brows done I think she said
they're going to lighten about 20% so
the first five days after you get them
done it'll look a lot darker than
they're actually gonna look I actually
liked that color I think next time when
I go in for touch-ups I think we're
gonna do a little bit darker because I
actually enjoyed that like dark cool
brown tone but as you can see it is in
saying to me how much they look like
brush strokes actually getting it done
was super easy we were just literally
talking and hanging out the whole time
Carrie is amazing she's just like one of
those people that has a really good vibe
to her and I just really appreciate her
work ethic and she takes everything very
seriously and professionally if you want
to see Carrie's work follow her on
Instagram it's fine lines studios and
you can also check out our Yelp page and
her website for tons of information she
basically has everything you need to
know on there the price is on there Oh
which Pro talked about the price so the
price for permanent eyebrows ranges or
price is 500 which I feel like is
totally worth it for me to never have to
touch my brows again for the next five
years totally worth it to me I was
telling her how I found people on
Groupon in Seattle and a good point she
made was like this is something that you
probably don't want to be going for the
lowest bidder since this is pretty
permanent this is an investment don't
cheap it out go for the work that you
like now I'm going to talk about a
little bit what I noticed after you get
your brows done your brows are going to
fade about 20% from when you first get
them done since you just put ink on your
face you basically just have to be a
little bit careful for the five days
following when you got your brows done
so you're not supposed to put a direct
stream of water on your face so no stay
underneath the shower or like fully
washing your face I was using makeup
removing pads and then I was going in
with like Bioderma or something to
actually cleanse my face
honestly like that was the hardest part
of this whole experience wish it for me
was just not being able to like fully
wash my face every night she said in my
notice gabbing about two or three days
in and some itchiness I actually didn't
notice any of that until about the
fourth or fifth day my brows didn't get
super itchy but she said at that point
you can put on a little bit of Vaseline
if yours do as far as scabbing I thought
it was going to look a lot worse than it
did it literally just looked like a
little bit of like white flakes in there
I basically just tried to stay away from
touching my brows you can't put any
makeup on them for the first five days
no water just basically leave them alone
and let them like chill there and do
their thing my brows are fully healed
now so right now since I had like a
full-on smokey eye on I did add a tiny
bit of product literally just to the
underneath part of my brow everything
else is completely staying on for did my
makeup look today I got a quick shot of
what they look like without brow product
on so you guys can see has been
absolutely amazing not having to touch
my brows at all in the morning it
literally saves me about 15 to 20
minutes every morning sometimes I'll add
a tiny bit of product just on my left
brow to get that shape that I want like
I said we're going to be touching that
up when I go back so they just look like
you have naturally amazing eyebrows but
if you guys go to Carrie tell her that I
sent you
she's amazing thank you to Carrie for
helping me love my brows I hope that you
can help other people watching love
