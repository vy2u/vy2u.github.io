top right now but on the bottom there's
nothing going on
thumbs up if you also never wear pants
so today we have the very first episode
of girl goes grad so I tweeted you guys
asking if you wanted some kind of video
or series talking about what to do after
college and how to get there and jobs
and applying for jobs and resumes and
all that kind of stuff so this is just
me speaking from my own experience and
what has worked I think to get me to
that point of having an interview if
you're in university you know that it's
all fun and games until fall of
senior year rolls around and then
gets real real fast I think this whole
process of actually applying for jobs
and graduating and like starting real
life is very scary too I mean most
people I know it's you know it's
something new you're moving on your
university years are over and you're
starting like real life but more than
that there's very little direction that
we get I don't know it probably varies
from university to university but I feel
like my school hasn't been the most
helpful in getting me to the steps I
need to be so I kind of did my own
research and I'm getting myself there on
my own
so I hope that this information is
useful for you guys especially if you're
a senior right now and you're also
applying for jobs or if you're not you
need to be right now
this is when companies hire for like
next year so I'm going to kind of split
this up into a few different videos if
you guys like this so be sure to give
this video a thumbs up and comment down
below if it's helpful for you at any
point so I know and I'll make another
episode
excuse the awkward stripe of Sun right
here the one day that we have Sun
literally so today's video is basically
going to focus on the things that you
need to do in order to apply for a job
so let's just start okay step one would
be to have a kick-ass resume so you can
obviously Google what a good resume is
or whatever but basically I think that a
good resume is short concise and looks
visually appealing don't want to have
something that's all in the same font or
all in the same font size and just
blends together no one's going to want
to sit around and read a novel when they
have
of other applicants to go through so
this is something that I kind of learned
as I went this time but you need to
tweak and adjust your resume for
whatever job you're applying for so
usually when job posts an application
it'll have a list of that you
should be qualified for and you need to
literally read that and put that in your
resume I'm not saying the live but just
embellish the facts like you need to
sell yourself this is your chance to
sell yourself to this person
for example I've been applying for a few
different kinds of things I did have an
interview with Emirates air because I
wanted their travel benefits but anyways
for the application I focused more on my
customer service background at Mac than
anything else because when you're
working with an airline that's obviously
customer service centered and that's
what you want to stand out in your
resume and to appeal to them but when
I'm applying for marketing jobs I will
make You Tube in my blog and all of that
the main focus because obviously that's
more important than customer service
depending on how old you are when you're
watching this and how long it's going to
be until you have to apply for jobs if
you don't have any work experience make
sure you list your education and put any
relevant coursework that you've taken
that would be useful and apply for that
job one thing that I wish I had done is
get a real job like sophomore year of
college having any kind of something to
put on your resume because there's
different skills that can be applied to
different jobs for example when I worked
at a dental office while it was the
boring issued of my life I learned how
to do Excel and Microsoft PowerPoint
whatever like all of those kind of
technical things that certain
applications want if you're watching
this I would get a job like ASAP
anything to put on your resume I think I
just fixed the blind issue good to go so
my game distracted my second piece of
advice would be to have a even more
kick-ass cover letter so if you don't
know what a cover letter is because
honestly I didn't when I started this
whole process it's basically a formal
to the hiring manager explaining your
qualifications and why they should hire
you
puffer letters are kind of tricky
because you want it to sound formal but
you don't want to sound like you just
copied and pasted something off of
Google it's really your chance to sell
yourself to the person that's reading it
because you want your letter to stick
out and be more original and doesn't
sound like a you know paper copy of all
of the rest of the ones that are reading
so get more personal good writing is
always a great skill to have
so obviously and this is true for your
resume to make sure there's no freaking
grammar errors that is like the easiest
and worst mistake you do because it
shows that you don't even care enough to
proofread your resume or cover letter
give it to a friend give it to your
parents have them read it 10 times like
read that over and over again
because that's literally the worst thing
you can do for the formatting of a cover
letter you want to have your name the
company's name their address and then
you want to start it out by either
saying dear so-and-so like their actual
name if you know it but a lot of times
you don't so just say dear hiring
manager then you say your letter you
give your contact info and then you
conclude it with like sincerely
so-and-so you want it to be a formal
letter but you want the body of the
letter to have a little bit of character
if that makes sense also for the cover
letter you obviously want to rewrite and
change and adapt that to whatever job
that you're applying for make sure you
change the name of the company because I
have definitely been there and sent in
the wrong cover letter to the wrong
company not good so number three I think
is kind of interesting when I was doing
research for this whole like process
like how to stand out amongst other
applicants and that kind of stuff one of
the things that I read were there have
been a lot of articles within the past
like year so like this is a fairly new
thing to do is have a personal website I
obviously can't show you an example of
mine because it has all my info and
everything but if you go to weebly.com
no I'm not like sponsored by them or
anything they are a free website builder
super easy to use and choose different
templates and everything it looks super
professional and this
is kind of a virtual resume so what I
was reading about is if you include a
link to your personal website which a
lot of applications ask for now that
person is 50 percent more likely to call
you in for an interview and that is
crazy just by having a personal website
you stand above that many other
applicants so that's something like
super easy so do it why not
mine has like my name contact info
examples of my YouTube and blog other
relevant stuff that I have done has a
document to where you can open my actual
resume things like that so it's just
kind of a way for someone to visually I
guess understand more of like who you
are and what your capabilities are and
also I read on Forbes I think it was
that only 2% of applicants are doing
this right now
so if you have this this will completely
set you above other applicants so do
that the fourth big thing I would say is
you have to have a LinkedIn account this
is where everyone is right now this is
where you're gonna find a lot of jobs
that you can apply for this is where
people are seeking out employees need to
completely fill out your LinkedIn
profile you need to have a
professional-looking profile picture
don't be posting like a selfie or some
 no you need to go outside put on a
suit look professional and have someone
take a picture of you those are my like
four biggest tips I can give you for the
basics of applying for a job I guess
comment down below and like this video
if you want episode 2 which would be how
to make this a reality and actually get
the interview I hope this helps some of
you if you're in my boat and it's senior
year I feel like that look it's all we
need we just bonded I think the biggest
key in this whole process is not losing
motivation and just keep on going or
obviously not gonna hear back from every
company but if you do these steps and
like in the next episodes and everything
if you use this information I think it
will honestly help you guys because this
is all the research I've done and I
do you think it's helped me get a lot of
the interviews that I don't even feel
like I was completely like qualified for
compared to other applicants if you're
wondering the shirt is from wrong way
there is the link down below it's really
cute I'm obsessed with it it's a very
nice material too and I feel like it
would look really good with like a
longer colored necklace I don't know why
we're talking about this shirt right now
I know you guys keep asking for the Mac
video in the eyebrow tutorial all of
those are coming I'm freaking
overwhelmed with videos right now and I
keep recording new stuff and then like
forgetting to record that so it's all
coming I promise
yeah so we can got pretty intense today
and I need to put my eyebrows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
