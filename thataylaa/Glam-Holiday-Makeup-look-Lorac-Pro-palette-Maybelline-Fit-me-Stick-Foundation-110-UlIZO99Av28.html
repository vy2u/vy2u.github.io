schmooze on the look I'm wearing right
now
super excited to be filming this video
because this is a collab with a good
friend of mine here on YouTube Malory
17/12 love that girl I know a lot of you
guys watch my videos because you need
tips for pale skin she's also a pale
princess and she does some kick-ass
tutorials and reviews
I just really love Malory because her
videos are very real and candid and she
has fun and she's just I feel like we
would get along in real life I think you
guys would really enjoy her videos so
make sure you check her channel out I'll
leave it down below obviously we both
did a holiday look using the lorac Pro
palette because we both don't have the
two or the mega hashtag broke college
graduate if you're new to my channel
coming over from Malory's welcome to my
 show of a channel shadow in shoes
videos are basically my kind of get
ready with me videos we talk about
random things and put things on our face
if you guys want to see this look you're
in the right place just keep watching
what are we doing on the face I have no
idea got my girls mug ready to go
alright so I've already washed and pride
my face today use the L'Oreal magic Lumi
primer I've been kind of reaching for
this stuff again over my benefit
Porefessional just because I really like
the dewy look anyways can starting to
get drier so I just like the way that
this looks and it helps the makeup stay
on longer so I think for foundation
today we're going to use the Maybelline
fit me stick this is in the shade 110
and it is light enough I think in my
first shadow which means video ever I
use this thing you should really like
this it isn't the most long wearing
foundation so if that's what you're
looking for don't buy this but it does
give a really nice finish and the
coverage is surprisingly good so I just
like to put that on there and then we're
going to blend with the Sigma f80 to
brush this is my favorite brush to blend
the foundation I think it just works
really well because it's so dense this
would be a good foundation if you just
need something super fast in the morning
like
Pfaff such as was this is a pretty
freakin good job covering up my acne you
can see before and after kind of love
makeup if you guys have told me that the
normal fit me foundation is also light
enough for fair skin I still have to try
that one I don't know it just never
appeals to me when I'm walking through
the drugstore got it clearly keep going
on up there
so for under eye concealer I've been
trying to use up my maybelline instant
age rewind I think I'm almost there
couple more days we can do it doesn't
feel so good when you finish to make a
product blending this in with my finger
and getting some oh my I wish my
favorite powder to set the under eyes is
the Physicians Formula correcting powder
if you have fair skin this will be your
lifesaver I use this every single day on
an elf powder brush and just pack it on
it's from the drugstore it's portable
and I just loved it I'm also just
putting a little bit of this in my
t-zone to highlight I really hope you
guys can get the lawnmower right now why
is it that my entire neighborhood is
silent until I decide to whip out the
camera all right we're just gonna roll
with it I'm going to be taking my Too
Faced cocoa powder foundation I have
there we go I have a whole review of one
that works so hard to come out one of my
all-time favorite powder foundations I
use it to set my foundation obviously I
don't use a lot and you just need a
little bit of this stuff there we go
you guys don't even know how many times
I say alright and there we go when I
edit my videos I literally think I cut
out like 45 mowing a lawn is really not
necessary right now so to contour I'm
taking my Sedona lace palette this has
been like a Holy Grail this month I'm
just like praying that you guys can't
hear this I do a four dollar off coupon
code I'm obsessed with this thing I've
mentioned this I think in every shadow
and schmooze this month
it's just perfect I'm just mixing these
two shades it's really hard to do in the
viewfinder just like a perfect natural
looking contour there's a completely
white powder in this palette which is my
favorite part of this palette and I'm
just putting this on a tapered powder
brush and putting this
my inner corner just kind of over where
we set our under-eye concealer this
helps to brighten things up a shit-ton
doing guys in a bit right now the FIR
brows I'm taking my gel from the brow
bar to go which is pretty disgusting one
thing I'm going to take this on the same
brush that it comes with we're gonna put
the gel on first and then just go over
it with some black eyeshadow under why
by putting gel on my brows is like the
most satisfying feeling I really don't
understand why it's necessary to mow the
lawn on a Saturday morning you have six
other days to choose from so I'm just
using that same brush I can't talk while
I do my brows it just doesn't work out
one down one to go it's like such a
relief when you get your brows done
favorite primer Lele has been the BH
Cosmetics Studio Pro waterproof primer
you really never know what consistency
is going to come out of it that's the
only downside just putting this all over
where we're going to be applying
eyeshadow obviously I've been having the
shittiest recording luck by the way if
you guys follow my Instagram this on
Instagram or Twitter Instagram if you
guys follow my Instagram I had like the
recording day from hell last weekend two
and a half hours trying to record a
video that I'm not even putting up
because the lighting is just awful I
think the moral of story is I need to
get the deeper ring light or something
let me know what your guys's favorite
lighting is to film at night thinking of
asking for the diva ring light for
Hanukkah where all my brushes out there
now alright so for this eye look we are
going to tape off the corners without a
long enough face I don't know I'm just
going to stick this on the back of my
hand first to take off some of the
stickiness follow the line of your
bottom lash line and just place that
tape on there ladies it's just going to
help us get a super crisp line and we
don't have to worry about things getting
places we don't want them on time I kind
of want just like walk outside like the
see what happens so this whole eye look
is going to be using the lorac Pro
palette I do not have the second palette
I do not have the makeup palette so
we're using the pro palette you sit on a
lace EB whoa 13 brush has been my
favorite blending brush lately I think I
kind of want to do like a deep purpley
silvery eye I don't know we'll see what
happens so I'm gonna be taking a mob and
we're just going to be popping this in
the crease I would really feel like I
can't move my body when I have tape on
my eyes I don't know why working the
tape is so nice because you don't really
have to think about anything all right
Taylor get your together so we're
going to start out with the shade pewter
right here it's one of the metallic
shades and I'm just going to take this
on my finger and put this all over the
lid we're going to be placing other
colors on top of this so don't worry
about getting it perfect or not now that
we've got that shade on we are going to
go in with one shade from The Naked 2
palette we're going to go in with verb
from The Naked 2 palette this is like
one of my all-time favorite eyeshadow
colors I just think it's super unique
so I'm also taking this on my finger and
we're going to put this in the center of
our eye on top of that pewter color now
we're going in for my favorite part
we're going to take the deep purple
shade in this palette we're going to put
this in the crease I'm usually not about
putting like metallic shades in the
crease I think this color is deep enough
that it'll be it'll be okay I'm just
going to start by putting this on the
outer third you want to make sure that
you're kind of blending this into the
silver so there's no harsh lines going
on what is on my forehead how the heck
did that just get there anyways then I'm
going to go back in with mob on that
same brush and
and I do feel like we need to help this
verb shade stand out a bit more so I'm
just going to go in on a really tiny
flat shader brush and pack that color on
and then spray it with some where the
heck should I put this we're going to
spray that brush with some urban no skin
a navy a setting spray you can also just
use water but this is just more
convenient now we're going to pack it
right on in the middle look at that this
shade is so freakin pretty I just wiped
that brush off and then on the same
brush we're going to go in with white
from the lorac Pro palette I really like
how there's a matte white shade in here
I feel like that's kind of rare for a
palette and this is the evey 21 by the
way by Sedona Lise and pop this right
under the brow bone alright so for our
liner we're just going to put on the
Lime Crime in the shade quill look at
the packaging of this so freaking cute
it's literally silent for a minute and
then as soon as I try to say something
I'm going to let that eyeliner dry and
then we are going to peel off the tape
tape is off if you are a beginner at
winged liner I would definitely
recommend putting some tape on just
makes the process a whole lot easier if
you have like little situation like this
going on I'm worried about it we're
gonna blend everything out and you wanna
be able to go in with mob again on just
this little brush blending the bottom
lash line I'm going to take the deep
purple shade again on that same brush
and do the outer third a little bit you
don't want to bring this too far in
because this is a holiday look I still
want our eyes to look nice and bright
and open and not too smoky if you know
I'm saying and I'm gonna go in with the
Milani brow and I highlight and just use
that matte end we're gonna pop this on
our waterline actually want our
waterline to be a little bit brighter so
I'm going with some white eyeliner so
for the inner corner I'm going to take
the lightest shade in the Physicians
Formula shimmer brick I love this thing
you can use it on your face or eyes I
think we're also going to use this on
our face in a second I'm just taking
this white shade and we're gonna put
this right on the inner corner so I'm
going to do some mascara and falsies the
falsies I'm going to use my favorite
this me 0-3 lashes these are from eBay
I'll link them in the down bar your lash
glue I'm using my favorite duo lash
adhesive this is just brush on and it
works amazingly I'm going to apply these
and I will be right back so falsies and
bottom mascara is on for blush I'm going
to use Mac seem to be seen I feel like
this is like a perfect wintery very kind
of shade I'm pretty sure this was a
limited edition but you can use any kind
of berry tone that you have using my
favorite cosmetics foundation brush for
this I just love the way that it applies
blush so for a highlight I'm going back
in with my shimmer strips I still AM you
know what this thing is called I think
it's a shimmer brick buy in with the
lightest shade as well as we can on this
brush and just popping this on the top
of the cheekbones look how frickin
pretty this thing is for lips I just
want like a deep deep red color my
favorite one for that is the covergirl
outlast
5
23 this is just like my go-to red
lipstick got too deep or it's not like
super wearable it just is perfect and it
literally lasts all day like this stuff
is showing up a lot brighter on camera
but once this thing dries it is like the
maddest greatest thing and it's not
going anywhere all right so this is the
final look if you guys like this video
be sure you give it a thumbs up so I
know hope you guys have a Happy
Thanksgiving
eat lots of turkey love you guys thanks
