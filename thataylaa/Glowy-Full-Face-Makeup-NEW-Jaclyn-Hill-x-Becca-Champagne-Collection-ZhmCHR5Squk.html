with me at shadow extra moon style video
on a bunch of new so Jaclyn hill
and becca cosmetics came out with a
collaboration if you haven't heard of it
where have you been I did a full look
with those products and also a bunch of
other stuff that is new to me pretty
much used almost all new products in
this video that I haven't shown on
camera before hair is obviously
different I'm becoming a whole video on
what's going on with my hair right now
but I'm basically going from black to
silver so that's been fun so if you want
to see how I got this look you're in the
right place just keep watching talk to
you
ranked what goes down before filming
YouTube video so I pulled a bunch of
makeup that I haven't either haven't
used yet or it's new or whatever so I've
already washed my face I didn't prime it
because I want to try out this freedom
makeup Pro studio strobe cream I am not
too familiar with this brand but I
didn't try there whatever try swatch one
of their contour shades which I think
I'm using today and it looked super nice
so I'm excited to try out this brand i
swatched this on my hand last night and
I was gonna originally mix it in with my
foundation but it's pretty sheer like
it's not a super illuminating show-up
cream kind reminds me the Mac strobe
cream like it's better to apply under
your foundation in my opinion but it
smells so good very strong scent but I
actually really like it this is the
first time I'm wearing my hair curly
since I started the process going to
silver and I'm going to be filming a
whole video I think today if they
actually need to clip those back they're
going to be filming a whole video today
oh yeah looking cute on a process thus
far but I'll give you guys a look the
back is like a shit-ton blonder and
lifted a lot more than the front I did
go to this long why am I talking about
this in this video it shouldn't be able
video on it life has been a little crazy
literally having sat down look this is
the first time I'm sitting down in
forever I usually pre film my videos a
couple weeks in advance so when I feel
this is the Jacqueline Hill I just got
something Jacqueline Hill back there
cosmetics watching so we're gonna be
using that today but I just say I've
already played around once a little bit
and it's beautiful but I wanted to show
you guys on camera so for foundation
today when we mixing the Estee Lauder
Double Wear in the shade 1c one with the
Jacqueline shimmering skin perfecter I
did this combo yesterday and really
liked it but it was a tad too dark so
I'm gonna mix it in a tiny bit of the
next foundation mixer if you're new to
my channel I have a whole video on
foundation or just happen the whole
playlist that goes through foundations
for pale skin and my foundation reviews
and how it makes everything so I'm gonna
link that in the description box down
below picked up this sponge from writed
and it's basically a dupe for the Real
Techniques sponge so we're gonna crack
this guy open I'm gonna go what this is
gonna stink so I just wet it and it
feels pretty firm so we'll see how the
foundation brush or any is back up if
this doesn't work so just got my
concoction going the FCI water
foundation and one c1 is too dark let me
know down below if there's a lighter
shade I got this like I don't even know
probably three or four years ago I did a
foundation video on it a while ago and I
kind of wanted to try out a different
shade because it is a really good
foundation if you mix something into it
in my opinion a by itself it's a little
bit too like thick and matte for me but
I do like mixing it and it gives an even
coverage let's try this guy out it feels
super hard like this is not promising oh
yeah feels like a freaking rock and it's
literally soaking up yeah okay literally
just soaked up everything looks like I
didn't put anything on my face so I'm
gonna toss this then go in with the
foundation brush kind of want to try
this one this is the morphe g36 I
haven't used this yet feels like a nice
feels like it could be a nice foundation
brush let's try there you go look at the
difference in coverage it's not insane
just what tools can do it's weird doing
makeup with this area because I have no
idea like what colors are doable
this and lip colors have been really
strange this is the second day I think
I've had this hair and lip colors are
totally different like stuff that used
to look amazing with my black hair just
totally doesn't work with this hair
color so I don't think the stroke cream
we put on really did anything I'm
getting like a little bit of reflective
myths but my skin just feels nice and
smooth this is good if you're trying to
set as a primer all right foundation is
on skin is looking nice and glowy we got
good coverage for concealer going in
with my Holy Grail collection cosmetics
concealer you can get this off of ebay
if you're in the u.s. if not you can get
it at like boots or whatever I think I
might try the G 38 am I trying blend
this out would this usually I don't like
using brushes for concealer because I
feel like it takes away some of that
coverage okay like bears you got good
coverage putting a little bit of this
down the center of my face just to
highlight and also on any acne that
still needs a little bit more coverage
I've been getting a lot of questions
about the spur on the lock to experiment
I reset it and I haven't actually
started taking it I was taking a
different medication for my migraines
and they told me to wait to make sure
that I wasn't getting a reaction from
that first now I'm gonna start using
this barrel after him we will see
hopefully that helps drying that before
accutane going in with my stargazer
powder then I use every single day just
up the under eye this stuff is amazing
it's like five bucks off the cameras on
okay just realize it didn't pull up
setting powder so I will be right back
actually I kind of want to try I have
this wet and wild geometric highlighting
powder and it's actually not glow it's
actually not that great as a highlights
not intense enough in my opinion so I
might use a big fluffy brush and try and
just
my foundation with this I think that's
what we're gonna do why not feeling the
glow
ooh actually looks really nice glowy
foundation I don't feel like any right
now his hair so in fact I was Andy in
eighth grade for a musical of course I
was that kid who like didn't want to be
front center or even on stage at all and
they chose me Brandi I'm using the same
brow stuff and it seems to be okay next
time I lighten it I'll probably have to
change up my brows but I've just been
going with the Ardell dark brown brow
pomade switching between this in the
color pop pencil I pretty much use the
color pop pencil on a more regular basis
because it's just faster all right brows
are on next we're gonna go in to prime
the eyes this is L'Oreal lippies in the
shade nude this has been one of my
favorite primaries lately I got this off
of glambot for super cheap and we're
just gonna apply this all over the lid
and then let it set a little bit so for
a contour I have this freedom makeup Pro
contour kit this is in the shade medium
0-2 this is just the one that they sent
me I would have got the light one but
this contour shade actually looks really
nice I can get this open so it's a
pretty nice cool tone shade and I feel
like this is actually a pretty light
they feel super nice and buttery I
haven't applied this in my face it just
likes washed it so I'm gonna go ahead
and contour it up
okay I feel like that shade is perfect
perfect amount of warmth to it where it
doesn't look super ashy but it doesn't
look orange at all all right super into
this the going on with the Becca Jaclyn
hill palette I feel like this packaging
is beautiful it has a nice like
cleanable material so it's not going to
get super dirty and it just feels really
sturdy and like high-quality in here
there's five different shades there's a
blush contour or bronzer a highly I
think it's supposed to be like a blush
highlight blush topper the two highlight
shades so this one is champagne pop and
then this one is per second pop both of
these are actually too dark for my skin
tone to use alone champagne pop works
but it just looks a little bit too dark
and Goldy for my skin tone I'm going to
mix the rosier shade with a lighter
highlight matte actually mix it with
that highlighting powder again
I'm gonna plug whatever's left over
death or joy nose for blush I'm gonna
try a combo of this shade with this
shade over here and this one looks
pretty pigmented so I'm literally just
gonna like tap my brush in here oh it's
super pretty that blush shade is super
pigmented you literally only need a tiny
bit just don't weigh too much before we
go in for eyes I'm gonna just spray my
face with some setting spray this is the
hard candy it fast and fabulous I use
this yesterday and I liked it I think I
like my L'Oreal one a little bit better
so on the eyes we're gonna use a mix of
Jacqueline's eyeshadow palette and her
base thought I've used this a couple
times before and they blend out super
nice so I'm gonna start out with this
middle shade right here which is like a
nice taupe matte and blend that into the
crease I don't think I've tried any of
that guys I shot this before I just
realized then you kind of remind me of
Laura off a little bit the way they
blend out and just the pigmentation X
I'm gonna go in with this shade this
like bronze shade on my finger and Rin
with this all over the lid Oh super
pretty well that has a really nice like
light gold reflect to it since it has a
little bit of a like orange II warm tone
to it I feel like if you have green eyes
it just makes them pop let's go in with
this darker shade right here gonna put
this into the crease a little bit and
just on the outer here the root of my
egg actually looks a bit darker in the
pan than what's coming up on my eye and
we go with the darkest brown shade and
put this on the Hat outer half of my
bottom lash line taking this shade again
and blending that out we go back in with
the brown shade on my finger and just
put a little bit more of that on the lid
yeah that cheese is my favorite that is
beautiful
going in with the lightest white gold
shade here we're gonna put this on the
button inner corner words what are they
I don't think I want to put anything on
the waterline
okay I think I'm just gonna pop out some
wing
liner using position of formula that
gooster obviously not sure when this
video is gonna be going out this is on
sale for like seven bucks right now on
Ulta is it insane how much of difference
winged liner makes like look at that
I've been on false lashes but before
that I'm going to try out this it
superhero elastic stretch volumizing
mascara this is just a sample size
it connects actually came out with a ton
of travel sized things the BB cream is
freakin adorable it's like that big I'm
just gonna do a light coat before I put
on some false lashes give it me some
volume
I am super picky with mascaras so this
is exciting
okay well that's drying before we put on
false lashes I'm going to go in for the
lips I have this over shade here in
Staten Island this is like one of my
favorite grayish ope colors head and
carried this color with my a little bit
too cool with this hair okay I feel like
this looks way too cool toned I'm gonna
try and put that blush actually on top
just Pat it on top from the champagne
collection oh that totally works feeling
that combo time to go in with the lip
gloss just to top it off cuz my lips are
super dry right now this is the buxom
Kimberly
I love the buxom lip glosses they're
super minty so if you're into that you'd
love this these are the I wore one
twenty ones I mentioned these in the
haul video then I think will be up for
this I'll link it in the description box
