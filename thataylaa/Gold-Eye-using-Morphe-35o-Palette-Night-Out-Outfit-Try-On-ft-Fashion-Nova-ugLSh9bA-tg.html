washed and primed my face I'm going in
with a mixture of these two foundations
Marc Jacobs remarkable with the
cosmetics CC cream illumination version
I just mix these on a palette and then
we're going in with my current favorite
foundation brush this is by morphe and
it's the e30 one I believe I'm gonna
have all the products listed below but
I'm gonna be using a ton of morphe in
this video I always want to call it
morphe I'm gonna use a ton of morphe in
this video because they sent me a crazy
PR package they post on Instagram so
I've been trying everything out and I'm
really excited about a lot of the stuff
so I'm going in with the collection
cosmetics concealer this has been my
favorite concealer I mentioned this in
my raisin rejects video perfect color
stays on doesn't crease all the good
stuff so I'm blending that out with
another morphe brush and I'm going in
with my stargazer powder I found this on
Amazon it's like five dollars and it's
amazing for setting your under eyes if
you have pale skin if you don't this
will probably be too light for you but
if you have pale skin it just adds that
perfect amount of lightness without
being like a stark white powder and it's
hard to find a white powder that has a
good texture to it but this one does now
going with a BH Cosmetics eye primer
putting this all over the lid this has a
tiny bit of shimmer to it but nothing
super intense and for this entire eye
look I'm going to be using the morphe
35o palette which how freaking beautiful
is this thing this palette is so hard to
get your hands on they sell out like
every time it goes live so just check
their social if you want to know when
it's live but I'm just blending a light
tan brown shade into the crease my
eyebrows you're seeing right now I
actually don't have any product on them
they
is what it looks like after I got the
permanent brows I mean making a whole
video on getting permanent eyebrows my
experience so I don't know if that video
will be up first or if this video but
check description box because I'll link
it if it is I'm putting this warm brick
kind of shade into the crease is that a
color brick I think so
voiceover is a hard man let me know if
you guys like voiceovers or if you like
shadow and schmooze the morphe shadows
were blending out super easily super
happy with the 35o palette so far from
the ones I've tried I do have a more pea
discount if you're interested it's
tailored ten and that'll give you ten
percent off your whole order spring in
my brush with some mac's fix+ and then
going in with this gold shade just to
add a little bit more shimmer I honestly
didn't even need the fix plus it was
totally fine without it
now I'm gonna take this brown shade
deeper Brown and put it into the outer V
and just blend I'm gonna go back in with
a blank empty whatever blending brush
and just blend everything out in a
second I'm kind of going for a more
wearable gold smokey eye I didn't want
to do anything too intense or put any
black on there just because the dresses
that I'm gonna be wearing are pretty
bold and that's kind of how I usually
coordinate my makeup with my outfits if
I'm gonna be having just like a chill
relaxed outfit then I'll do more intense
makeup or like a dark vampy lip but if
not I'll just keep it lighter on the
makeup and go with a bold outfit so I'm
just blending some of that light brown
shade on the lower lash line just to add
a tiny bit down there and I'm going on
with my favorite Physicians Formula I
booster liquid liner this stuff is
amazeballs
talked about it 500,000 times and I'm
just making a quick wing sorry I'm like
chilling down out of frame right now
doing a super light coat of mascara on
the top and then I'm gonna go in with
violet Voss just layin false lashes
these have been some of my favorites if
you like the doll like separate of
lashes these are beautiful adding a
cream liner to my waterline just to open
up the eyes a little bit and then I'm
gonna try out this morphe contour
palette thing there's actually a white
shade in here which I was super
surprised about I'm taking this shade
right here to go in for a slight contour
slash bronze and this brush is amazing I
mentioned
on snapchat I've been posting on
snapchat my favorite morphe brushes for
the past like month or two but this one
I love and this contour shade was
actually pretty nice on my skin what do
you guys think I'm taking that white
shade and just popping a little bit
under the guise I didn't want to go to
intent I just feel like you can't have a
white powder and not put it on your face
am i right now I'm taking my ELF
illuminating palette and using that
shade that I mentioned in my race and
rejects video this is just such a pretty
like everyday highlight if you have pale
skin now I'm going in with some
covergirl blush been using this everyday
- and this blush brush pretty much all
the face product besides a contour I've
been using everyday now i'm going with
this morphe brush which is this huge-ass
powder brush I think it's the e - it is
so soft all the brushes by the way from
the elite collection that is my favorite
collection I've tried so far and now I'm
going with some Becca shimmering skin
perfecter just to make the highlight a
tiny bit more intense and topping it off
with some setting spray by L'Oreal and
then what I'm doing bottom mascara for
my bottom lashes because where else to
put mascara using Mac's tone liner which
is like a very gray topi shade and then
I'm gonna put some over cosmetics liquid
lipstick in Dubai on top of that I've
kind of been liking the look of having a
warm eye and then doing like a cooler
lip I just feel like it gives it a nice
contrast so we are almost done with the
makeup here I'm gonna show you guys some
outfit ideas some of these things I had
actually bought for a New Year's Eve and
then didn't end up wearing but they're
kind of more of like a glam going out
look at least for me because they
usually wear like jeans and boots
they're mostly all from fashion Nova so
I'm relieved willing for fashion OVA
with a coupon code for you guys down
below hope you guys enjoy I'm gonna
leave it to the music let's do this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
