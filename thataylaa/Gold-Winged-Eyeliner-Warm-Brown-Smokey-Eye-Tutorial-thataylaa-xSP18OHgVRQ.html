gold winged eyeliner look I woke up and
felt like I needed gold liner on my face
so this is what's happening I do have a
foundation routine coming for the look
I'm wearing in this video and all of the
product info will be listed down below
so we're priming our eyes with Mac's
painterly Paint Pot like always putting
this on the top and bottom and then I'm
going to go in with a morph shadow and
also a morph blending brush I have been
really enjoying these shadows and their
brushes I've been using them pretty much
every day now i'm going in with the soft
brown color in its judys time palette
this is if you watch my other tutorials
this is usually what I put my crease and
then yeah having a moment with Max
Browns grip you're not in a relationship
with your eyeshadow weird I promise you
mack brown script is better than any
boyfriend you will ever have we're just
defining our crease a little bit more
with this and I'm going back in with the
empty blending brush and just smoothing
out all the edges with this would be a
super soft and kind of smoky brown so
make sure that all of your edges are
blended then I'm taking a more eye
shadow and putting this under the brow
bone and then also in the inner corner
to brighten up the eye a little bit
again all the specific colors will be
listed in the down bar now I'm going
back in with max brown script and
running this with a sigma pencil brush
on my bottom lash line I just got this
pencil brush and I just feel like it
makes my life so much easier yeah here
we go just coating that on or the
Goldwing I'm going to be using NYX
liquid liner and extreme goal if you
don't have a gold liner you could always
use half-baked from the Naked palette
and just wet it with a angled brush and
then kind of use it as an eyeliner
now I'm going to be lining my waterline
with lore'l carbon black pencil liner
and I'm going to throw on a super thin
coat of mascara before we apply falsies
and for the falsies i'm using the jojo
lashes from the sweetheart collection
from oh my gosh calm that was a long
sentence now to blend in my natural
lashes with the falsies i'm just using
my L'Oreal carbon black mascara and then
I'm going to be going over this tiny bit
just the band to cover up any lash glue
with my morph gel eyeliner in black and
then I felt kind of inclined to make
like a cat I with the eyeliner on the
bottom this is totally optional I don't
know it's just you know just feeling it
so then I'm going to use my wet and wild
make a link mascara to put my bottom
lashes and here's the finish I look now
for lips I'm going to be taking mac
prolongwear in staunchly stylish this is
by far my favorite lip pencil Mac has
ever made since it is pro longwear it's
longer lasting than the normal ones and
I just love love love this color and
then here's me trying to find a lip
gloss where are you okay got it now this
is revlon colorburst lip gloss and
Bellini and I'm just applying this to
the center of my lips to make the lips
appear a little bit fuller and this is
the finished look be sure to give this
video a thumbs up if you liked it and if
you want more tutorials be sure to tweet
me your pictures or tag me on instagram
oh yeah just like this if you do this
look thanks for watching and I'll see
you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
