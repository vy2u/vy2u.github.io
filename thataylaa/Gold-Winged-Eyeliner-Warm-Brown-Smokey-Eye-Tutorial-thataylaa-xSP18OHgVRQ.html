winged eyeliner look I woke up and felt
like I needed gold liner on my face so
this is what's happening I do have a
foundation routine coming for the look
I'm wearing in this video and all of the
product info will be listed down below
so we're priming our eyes with Mac's
painterly paint-pot I like always
putting this on the top and bottom and
then I'm going to go in with a morphe
shadow and also a morphe blending brush
I have been really enjoying these
shadows and their brushes I've been
using them pretty much every day now I'm
going in with the soft brown color in
its Judy's time palette this is if you
watch my other tutorials this is usually
what I put in my crease and then yeah
having a moment with Mac's Brown script
you're not in a relationship with your
eyeshadow we're I promise you Mac Brown
script is better than any boyfriend you
will ever have we're just defining our
crease a little bit more with this and
I'm going back in with the empty
blending brush and just smoothing out
all the edges and this would be a super
soft and kind of smoky Brown so make
sure that all of your edges are blended
then I'm taking a morphe eyeshadow and
putting this under the brow bone and
then also in the inner corner to
brighten up the eye a little bit again
all the specific colors will be listed
in the down bar now I'm going back in
with Mac's Brown script and running this
with a sigma pencil brush on my bottom
lash line I just got this pencil brush
and I just feel like it makes my life so
much easier yeah here we go just coating
that on or the gold wing I'm going to be
using NYX liquid liner in extreme gold
if you don't have a gold liner you could
always use half-baked from The Naked
palette and just wet it with a angled
brush and then kind of use it as an
eyeliner
now I'm going to be lining my waterline
with lore'l carbon black pencil liner
and I'm gonna throw on this super thin
coat of mascara before we apply falsies
and for the falsies I'm using the Jojo
lashes from the sweetheart collection
from oh my lash calm that was a long
sentence now to blend in my natural
lashes with the falsies I'm just using
my L'Oreal carbon black mascara and then
I'm going to be going over this tiny bit
just the band to cover up any lash glue
with my morphe gel eyeliner in black
and then I felt kind of inclined to make
like a cat eye with the eyeliner on the
bottom this is totally optional I don't
know it's just you know just feeling it
so then I'm gonna use my wet and wild
make a length mascara to coat my bottom
lashes and here's the finished eye look
now for lips I'm going to be taking Mac
Pro Longwear in staunchly stylish this
is by far my favorite lip pencil Mac has
ever made since it is Pro Longwear
it's longer-lasting than the normal ones
and I just love love I love this color
and then here's me trying to find a lip
gloss where are you okay got it now this
is Revlon's colorburst lip gloss in
Bellini and I'm just applying this to
the center of my lips to make the lips
appear a little bit fuller and this is
the finished look be sure to give this
video a thumbs up if you liked it and if
you want more tutorials be sure to tweet
me your pictures or tag me on Instagram
oh yeah just like this if you do this
look thanks for watching and I'll see
you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
