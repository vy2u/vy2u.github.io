something a little bit different nothing
to do with makeup we're gonna be talking
all about motivation productivity kind
of hacks tips things that I do to stay
organized to get done so this video
has been requested from you guys on
social media on YouTube for a couple
years now and I've talked about it here
and there in different shadow inch muses
but I kind of wanted to just do one
all-encompassing video answering your
questions from Twitter and just talking
through everything so if you're new here
just to give you a 20 second background
really quick I started YouTube when I
was a full-time college student so I was
doing it on the weekends I've kind of
always done YouTube as a side thing
until this year out of college I got a
job full time where I was working 50
hour weeks and then on top of YouTube so
I do YouTube on the weekends which
really taught me how to manage my time I
also have chronic pain which the only
reason why I bring that up is because my
hours that I have to get stuff done are
very limited and why I do certain things
that I do that I'm gonna talk about
whether you have a side project that
you're trying to do if you're working
two jobs if you have a full-time job and
have children hopefully these tips help
you if you're cited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up let's get
into it
alright so I wrote down notes as I was
on a plane for a couple hours for this
video so I have a bunch of tips and
stuff here that I want to talk about I
tried to break this down in a way that
it would make the most sense so I asked
you guys on Twitter to ask me questions
for this video and one of the questions
that came up a lot was where do you get
your motivation from what motivates you
and as I was sitting on the plane I was
really trying to think what does
motivate me and I think thinking about
that like really thinking about where
you get your motivation from is really
important because when I really thought
about it for me I think I get most of my
motivation from outside praise I guess
you could say so whether it's from my
family or from my friends when I do
something that I'm proud of and then in
return get praise or just
acknowledgement for it I find a lot of
satisfaction and knowing that I'm making
someone proud and I think that's what
motivates me like in the long term and
also just self-worth I find a lot of my
self-worth in my career which is why
workaholic I'll be the first to admit I
totally overworked I'm workaholic so
keep that in mind when I'm talking about
all this stuff I prioritize work over
certain things in my life because I do
find a lot of satisfaction and
self-worth in my career not that that's
a good thing or a negative thing it's
just that's who I am
so that's kind of what motivates me when
I think what I'm going to be doing six
months from now a year from now five
years from now that's like the big
picture motivation when I think about
what motivates me on a daily basis and
where I get that motivation from I think
there's a few things the first one for
me is thinking about what I could be
doing tomorrow if I get this done right
now having plans set that you know
you're gonna have to get stuff done
before you go do that obviously if you
are self-employed you kind of have to
have self motivation or else you're just
not gonna get anything done you're your
own boss so you really have to figure it
out and find something that works for
you but as far as just not being in the
mood not feeling it sometimes you just
kind of have to recognize that you're
not gonna be the most productive right
now and go take a break go take a walk
go do something for an hour and then
come back and sit down and get it done
that's kind of probably used to always
be in college if I went to a coffee shop
and was planning on cranking out a
couple essays or whatever it was and I
just sat down and could not write it it
just wasn't in the cards sometimes it's
not gonna happen and you just have to
give yourself time I think that's the
big thing for me is giving yourself time
to feel that way and then be able to
step away and come back to it if you're
cramming an essay the night before it's
due and you get that block you're not
gonna be able to write your best essay
you're not gonna be able to probably
turn it in on time but people are
totally different in that way like I had
friends in college who would write their
best under pressure the night before
it's due I cannot do that I'm not that
type of person I usually like to get
stuff done ahead of time so I'm not
last-minute stressing out if you are not
feeling motivated and not feeling like
you can get anything done I have two
things that I do one listen to music
listen a really good pump up music step
away from your desk or whatever it is
just put in your headphones and go
listen to some music that always pumps
me up music is crazy the way it can
change the way that you feel and then
also listening to
Podcast if you don't listen to Gary
Vaynerchuk his podcast is extremely
inspiring extremely motivating he
interviews different people different
entrepreneurs calls people up on the
phone and his advice is very similar to
the advice that I like and I need to
hear which is just blunt to the point
listen to one episode of his podcast and
who don't feel like you can go conquer
the world there's probably something
wrong there last thing that I do to
motivate myself is incentivize myself
when I was a kid and my parents would
make me go on these like long a spy
grades he used to bring M&amp;amp;Ms along and
every like 10 minutes they would give me
a few M&amp;amp;Ms so I don't know if that's
where this came from but I still do that
to myself to this day whatever motivates
you the most with food with going to
hang out with a friend whatever it is if
you're having trouble motivating
yourself give yourself some kind of
incentive reward sometimes if I like
really want to go to Target or TJ Maxx
only let myself go there if I get XYZ
done something that works really well
for me it's timing myself I'll even do
that I was like folding the clothes or
doing the dishes if it's something that
I really don't like doing I'll tie
myself to see how fast I can get it done
I don't usually do that with work
because I need kind of like rush through
it but I will kind of give myself the
goal to get it done by a certain time so
that I'm not getting sidetracked and
kind of stopping doing what I'm doing
alright so next up organization and then
we're gonna talk about execution in
order to be the most productive you can
be organization is so extremely
important and key I'm trying to think
how to break this down in a way that it
makes sense so first off I am a very
visual person whether it's in school
whether it's in work whether it's just
seeing what I have to do I'm super
visual so I have to have a planner even
if you don't think you're a visual
person get a freaking planner it will
change your life I'm not even
exaggerating having a planner is the
best thing that you can do for yourself
to stay organized to stay on top of
things and to actually get stuff done
there is no way I could get done what I
get done without a planner doesn't have
to be a planner it basically just needs
to be a piece of paper that you write
down what you need to get done this
week while your deadlines are what you
need to get done next week what you need
to get done three weeks from now
anything that you know you have to get
done by a certain date that way you can
work backwards from there
what planners allow you to do is
visually separate out the tasks that you
have to do and optimize your time if I
woke up every morning and I had no idea
what I had to do that day I would be
sitting there wasting time thinking
about what I had to get done I'm not
talking like playing out to the minute
unless that's your thing every single
night I write down what I have to get
done the next day usually I do that
about a week in advance but obviously
things come up and things changed so
before I go to bed I know what I have to
do in the morning and that lets me know
what time I have to wake up what time I
have to get something done by I can make
a whole other video on planners but ones
that I've used for years where the Erin
Condren planners these are expensive
they're like fifty bucks
honestly they're good I really like the
vertical version but if you're just
starting out you're not that into
planners just go to t.j.maxx and get one
that's like six bucks they have tons of
planners they just want to make sure
that there's enough to write out daily
tasks so like in the Erin Condren my
Erin Condren has vertical and horizontal
I like the vertical better because then
you can do like morning afternoon night
or whatever that's what I had been using
this is my current planner I just use
this I think it's like a German one the
actual planner insert in here it just
slides in and I got this off of Amazon
and I love this the pages are super soft
hangs around 30 bucks so cheaper than
the Erin Condren and I love the layout
it's still vertical but it fits in this
case this is really nice too because it
actually has a zipper right here which
you can put pens in I have a lot of
personal stuff in here so I don't really
like to show pages I've already used but
here's an example of a blank page when I
was still using the Erin Condren in
September so there is no way unless you
just have a crazy good memory or visual
memory or something that you could
picture in your head exactly what you
have to do two weeks from now three
weeks from now tomorrow all at the same
time which is why planners are great so
basically I work backwards so if you
work ahead of time it just minimizes the
chances that you're not going to be able
to get something done people have five
dozen excuses for why they couldn't get
something done
and of course life happens things happen
but if you work ahead of time the chance
that you're not gonna be able to get
something done is so much lower because
you have so much more time for example
if I know I post Monday Wednesday Friday
and I wait until the day before to film
each video I would not get any videos
out just with my whole stuff
there's no way so in order to still get
those three videos a week out I pre film
a lot so that I'm able to follow through
with something that I commit to so
whether it's health issues or kids or
you know some other commitment that you
have in your life if you try and get
stuff done ahead of time it's just so
much easier to actually get it done and
follow through with it so my point being
it would be really hard to do that and
plan ahead that much in advance without
writing stuff down most excuses can be
prevented if you're someone who finds
yourself kind of talking yourself out of
something and making excuses for
yourself while you can't get something
done I would just write down the excuses
that you're giving yourself and think
about whether it's something that's in
your control or if it's out of your
control for example if your kid gets
sick all of a sudden and you can't go to
work that day or you can't get something
done that's obviously something that's
out of your control if you tell yourself
that you can't get a project done in
time because you have a dinner party
that night that's something that was
probably avoidable if you manage your
time a little bit better throughout the
week you probably could have done both
and I also kind of block out my schedule
so if I know I have doctor's
appointments or I know I have social
stuff going on I kind of plan things
around that even when you're planning
out your days whether it's just going
grocery shopping getting errands done
whatever it is think about all the
things you have to do that week and try
and just group it together in half a day
or whatever so you can get it done all
at once and if that's not realistic just
just think through everything that
you're doing and think is there a better
time I could be doing this is there a
better way that I could do this in less
time I'm a firm believer in work smarter
not work harder if you can get in a
routine and just learn how to optimize
your time you'll be so much better off
let's talk about execution so I kind of
already talked about setting the timer
try it out if there's something that you
really don't want to get done it usually
makes you kind of move a little bit
faster and just get it done instead of
thinking about how you want to get it
done something else that I do I don't
usually write these down I just
to keep these in my head but have like
kind of a list of ongoing tasks that you
can do if you're not in the mood or mind
space to do something else so for
example for me it's usually cleaning the
house doing laundry doing like kind of
things around here that at least I'm
still being productive and getting
something done obviously that's
something that I'm able to do since I'm
self-employed is if I'm not in the mood
to do something at that moment I can do
something else and maybe I'll work at
9:00 at night that night but this also
applies to students or work at home moms
whatever so if it's during the day and
you're not feeling like you can get
something done that's work or school
related at least get something else done
that's productive that you'll have to do
at some point anyways so for me
something that really helps me get stuff
done is my workspace if I'm in a coffee
shop working I'm so much more productive
because I see other people around me
working I hear people on the phone I
hear people talking and just kind of
motivates me co-working spaces are a
great option if you work from home
because you're also surrounded by people
who are doing the same thing even if
you're in an office I used to move
around to different areas like in the
afternoon I would get so sick of being
out my desk and I would just be really
unproductive there so I would go and
find a different table or go and find a
conference room or something so I think
that's pretty much everything I feel
like if you take two things away from
this three things one get a planner and
if you do get a planner let me know how
it goes tweet me number two work ahead
of time will be so much less stressed
you'll be able to get things done on
time number three I would say really
think about what motivates you figure
out why you want to do what you want to
do whether you're in school and you want
to become a graphic designer for example
or if you have a job and you're working
towards an exposition whatever it is
figure out why you want that and I feel
like if you figure out why you're doing
something you'll have the motivation to
do it for some people might be a job
title for some people it might be
financial motivation it might be that
you just love what you're doing you're
super passionate about it or you believe
in the cause whatever it is figure out
why you get up every morning and why you
continue to do what you're doing I
really hope that helps you guys just
know that whatever it is I believe in
you you should believe in yourself and
you got this if this was helpful for you
