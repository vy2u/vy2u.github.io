you how to get this Halloween deer look
obviously I'm lacking ears and things
but you know if you wanted to be clever
you could put headlights on and be a
deer in the headlights
no okay we're going to start off with
bronzing I'm just taking my normal
bronzer and just contouring it up
putting on the forehead everywhere we
want a really nice bronze deer look you
know what I mean next I'm taking just a
highly pigmented blush and I'm kind of
just contouring more at this and also
just adding some color to the face next
thing I'm going to do is take a thick
white pencil I'm using the NYX jumbo eye
pencil and milk you can pretty much use
any anyone that you have that is
pigmented enough to kind of do this and
I'm just putting it all over my nose and
then my forehead in like the t-zone area
just blending that out with my finger
and then I'm going to take a powder and
just set all that kind of blend it into
the bronzer that we just did
then I'm going to prime my eyes I'm just
using a Jordana cheap eye primer just
put this all over the lid up to the brow
bone anywhere that we're gonna apply
color and the eyeshadow I'm using for
this whole look is the Naked 2 palette
so any of the eyeshadows you see here
can be found in that palette I'm using
the dark matte black shade and just kind
of making like a winged liner with it
really quick it doesn't have to be
perfect we're putting other eye shadow
over it it's just to get like the base
color on there and I'm gonna be taking a
brown shade and just applying that with
a flat shader brush over top of that
both eyes and just kind of blending it
up to the crease
then I'm gonna be taking the darkest
brown shade in that palette and just
putting that in my crease with the same
flat shader brush that I used before and
I wanted kind of like a what's that word
exact line no I don't know what that
where it is I wanted a line so I'm not
gonna like fully blend it out I wanted
it to be a dramatic kind of cat eye look
then I'm going to be putting liner this
is just regular black liquid liner about
half an inch down from my eye towards
the bridge of my nose out and making a
winged liner with that and then I'm
using that same NYX jumbo eye pencil in
milk and putting that in my waterline
and also below my waterline to make my
eyes look way bigger as you'll see then
again I'm gonna be taking that same
white and putting it under my brow bone
and then blending it out with my finger
and following up with that same white
eyeshadow that we use to blend the
t-zone
now I'm doing the bottom liquid liner
I'm just putting this in a line
underneath that white right where the
white stops and then I'm not fully
dragging it to the outer corner I'm just
stopping or right there now to make the
nose of the deer I'm taking a black
eyeliner and dragging it from where my
eyebrow starts and then kind of tracing
that shadow that you can already see of
the bridge of the nose around in a
circle and then back up now the best way
I can describe this part is to just kind
of make two little circles on each side
of your nose and then connect that now
I'm going to intensify the eyebrows I'm
just using a dark brown eye pencil and
just kind of deepening it up and already
you know just going over your eyebrows
making it more defined this is optional
but I think that it kind of really pulls
the look together
then I'm going in with another bronzer
this is just a dark brown bronzer with
that small brush that we use before and
I'm just putting this right in my
cheekbones it's gonna even define it
farther and then I'm also dragging it
down a little bit just to you know get
the face of a deer guys here's my
mascara face nobody needs to see that
now we're going to use the same jumbo
eye pencil in milk and make sure it's
sharpened because we are going to be
drawing circles and you can see look how
fun this looks we're going to draw as
many as you feel like drawing I think I
drew five or six somewhere around there
you
then to finish off the look I'm just
going to use a nude lip gloss or lip
gloss lipstick whatever you want you
could use a gloss this is max creme de
nude just putting that baby on this is
the finished look thumbs up this video
