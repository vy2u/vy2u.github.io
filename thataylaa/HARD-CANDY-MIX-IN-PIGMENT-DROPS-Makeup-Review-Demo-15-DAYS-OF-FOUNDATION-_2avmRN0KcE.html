all right so today it is day 13 of 15
days of foundation there are only two
days left sadness if you're new here
this is where I've been trying out a new
foundation every single day for 15 days
days one through twelve our link down
below in the 15 days of foundation
playlist today we're going to be talking
about the hard candy mixin pigment
makeup drops when these came out I think
this was the one of the most requested
products to review how super excited
when these came out for a couple reasons
hard candy typically has a very pale
light shades which is great they're
glamoflage foundation and porcelain is
like one of the lightest products I
found
but these reminded me of the cover FX
custom cover drops which I personally
love I talk more about these in the
video when I'm applying it but it's cool
to see drugstore alternative come out
taken me this long to review these
because it has been a frickin mission to
get my hands on these things I don't
know why but the Walmart in Seattle
didn't have these I couldn't find them
online for forever I finally ended up
getting them online Walmart when they
came out so I ordered three shades for
you guys to swatch different ones even
though I'm obviously using the lightest
shade which is fair one all right swatch
time so right here is the hard candy
pigment drops in fair one next to it is
fair to light one this is the etude BB
concealer foundation in the lightest
shade if you guys have asked me to
include a foundation that I think is
closest to my skin tone and when I apply
this one I think this foundation is the
closest match I've come to for my skin
tone this Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless 110 NAT the end the cover FX
custom cover drops in n 10 so in both
the cover facts and this you get point 5
fluid ounces of product they have 12
shades to this online Walmart so let's
resume the claims as they're highly
concentrated liquid pigments that allow
you to customize any face product for
coverage or shade squeeze the dropper
add drops to any daily moisturizer
primer or to create a custom foundation
so mixing it in with another foundation
the more drops you add the higher the
coverage you can also add light or dark
drops to any liquid makeup to custom
match your skin tone this one retails
for $7 which is very affordable anza for
this one retails for $44 so obviously
ginormous price difference there
this thing will seriously last you so
long because you only need a couple
drops in each each time you use it to uh
solve the claims on here hard candy is
cruelty free if you're enjoying 15 days
foundation don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up you can join the Bey
radio family by subscribing if you're
new here if you want to see how the hard
candy glamoflauge mix in pigment drops
if you like this is a long last name
fine wear throughout the day you're in
the right place just keep watching
alright so it is 914 right now in the
morning it's Saturday when I'm filming
this Kristy is actually coming today and
we're going to vlog our fare tomorrow
Sunday so that will have already
happened by the time you guys see this
but I hope I got to meet some of you
Seattle people bar do you wash
moisturize prime my face use my joy anti
blemish matte primer so i've swatched
fair one on the back of my hand a little
bit and the consistency is very oily
almost it kind of feels like the unique
foundation but with more coverage it
doesn't really feel anything like the
cover effects drops to me this one is
totally fine mixing in with moisturizers
primers whatever but this one I think
would be best mixed in with another
foundation so I'm going to try mixing it
in with one that I love and that I know
how it performs this is the covergirl
clean matte BB cream in 510 I have a
whole other review on this product I
absolutely love this is one of my most
reach for foundations but it's too dark
so I'm going to try mixing it in with
the fair one shade see if we can lighten
it a little bit and with this foundation
I sometimes do like one and a half
layers just to get the kind of coverage
I like so I'm hoping this will add a
little bit of coverage and lighten it
and since this is super mattifying I'll
kind of know if this product alters that
by the end of the night this foundation
literally holds up the entire day and
looks amazing so it says to shake well
and I can hear why
super super liquidy I'm going to do my
sponge on one side brush on the other
Sigma f80 like usual just to see how
both applied I typically use a brush
with this product alright so I've got
about that amount of foundation wow this
is really liquidy one I'm not even
squeezing let's try four drops that just
went on the outside the bottle because
it's literally so liquidy I wasn't
squeezing the top where at all it just
kind of comes out okay so it looks like
it lightened it a little bit it
definitely feels very thin
who smells very chemically is it weird
that I feel like this is actually giving
me less coverage I'm definitely going to
have to do a second layer you can still
see a lot coming through down here and I
usually get way better coverage of that
beauty cream it did lighten it though
for sure
looking like more satin-finish right now
let's try the brush on this side I'm
just going to stipple it on all right so
here we have one layer definitely
lightened it but also lighter coverage
than I usually get so I'm gonna use a
sponge to go in for a second layer and
see if we can build this up okay there
we go much better coverage on the second
layer now we're at about hi medium I've
gotten comments lately about how I like
beat my face with the Beauty Blender
can't help it you guys I'm just trying
to get done I don't got all day to
pounce around a Beauty Blender on my
face two layers we're looking good it
does feel like it's setting like the
covergirl one does so that's good I'm
going to do the rest of my makeup I will
be right back right now we're calling
the check-in times 9:25 so let's just
call it 9:30 all right so the rest of my
makeups on it's now 949 Christie is on
her way right now so I need to freaking
get my strip together literally try to
take this 15 dives so to set my face i
use the maybelline superstay better skin
there we go powder in the shade 10
porcelain this product I can set or not
set but I usually set it for going to be
wearing it for a full day everything
blended out totally fine on top I think
basically what this product did at least
with this foundation was just lighten it
and really see any added coverage at all
one of the cool things about the cover
FX drops is that you literally can take
a light coverage foundation into full
coverage I love this product I don't
have a full review on this yet but this
is one of my favorite foundation
products ever made I think it's an
awesome idea and the finish and
everything is beautiful but I do think
these breaking out a little bit which is
why I don't reach for it like everyday
if you just search cover FX custom cover
drops the Tayla all the videos I've used
it in I think there's a couple shadow in
shmooze will come up this one didn't
really seem to add any coverage to me it
did help to lighten it but I feel like
it changed the finish and formula a
little bit so
for me I probably just reach for
foundation Lightner like a white mixer
over this
I do the wrap-up video at the end of
this series I will try this product in
different ways I'm not totally ruling
that out but just the feel of this feels
very Gracie to me so on the rest of my
face kind of blush and bronzer I use
Pixy subtly suntouch I know I've used
this 5000 times during this series but I
love this product highlighter I tried
out this new makeup from profusion light
and 0/1 super pretty kind of pinky puts
on my highlight just a hair light again
so my eyes all used was the morphe 35o M
palette this has pretty much any warm
well where you go this is pretty much
any warm matte shade you could ever want
in life lipstick is Maybelline 920 nude
list and I carved out my brows today and
I used the it cosmetics bye bye
under-eye illumination I saw Kristin
Leon doing this on Instagram I think in
a video and this is actually perfect for
carving out your brows because it's
super thick this is not great for
underneath your eyes and I don't really
like this or spoken ceiling but for
carving out your brows is awesome
because it's light enough and it's very
thick so it doesn't like slide around or
anything so I think that's everything
I'm going to try and pop in between the
last check in since Chrissy's here will
probably be out doing stuff we're
calling the check-in time 9:30 see you
guys in a few hours
alright so it is now 242 so the
Foundation's been on for a little over 5
hours there's someone walking by right
now it's fun there just draw Chris job
somewhere and got my nails done I'm just
in the parking lot right now but I don't
think I'll be home for a while so I
figured we would just do this on my
iPhone I feel like my face is oxidize a
little bit I probably could have mixed
in a little bit more of the mixer but
right now I'm going to get super
up-close looks pretty good I have a
little bit of creasing around my nose
right here place on bikes and then a
tiny tiny bit in the center of my face
but everything else looks really smooth
and Matt still like the covergirl
foundation usually does so right now
looking good I'm going to go pick up
Christie and I think we're gonna go to
dinner and just hang out I will check
back in at the
like all right so it is now 913 p.m. so
the Foundation's been on for 12 hours
everything looks pretty much the same as
when I would wear this foundation just
by itself except I feel like I am
breaking down a little bit more in the
center of my forehead than I normally do
for being one for 12 hours I think it
looks pretty dang good like it doesn't
it's not separating anywhere majorly
to me I just think the cover of X drops
are worth the splurge I think it did an
okay job lightening it I think it just
makes sense to go in with the white
foundation mixer if you're using it for
that purpose if you want more coverage I
really don't think these are going to do
it like I said I think it actually
sheared out the foundation a little bit
more but these had more coverage I think
would make sense but just the
consistency of it how they're super oily
and almost feel greasy I don't know
something about it I'm not that into but
I will continue to try these I'm going
to try mixing it in with just a
moisturizer or primer just to see how
much coverage I can get on its own with
this and I'll update you guys in the
wrap-up video so the way that I used it
today I think these ones are pass for me
I should probably just do a full review
on this product or demo to show you like
different ways you can use it because
these are freaking awesome and I feel
like I don't talk about them enough so
just my two cents on this one not
totally worth it for what they're
intended for I hope you guys like this
video if you did make sure you give it a
thumbs up Christi's in the other room
right now so I'm going to go love you
guys thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
