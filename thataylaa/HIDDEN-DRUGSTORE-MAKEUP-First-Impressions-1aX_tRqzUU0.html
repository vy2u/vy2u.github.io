video this one came to me at 12 a.m. was
laying in bed I was in CVS earlier that
day and I was looking at all the
products kind of on the bottom shelves
that I never even have looked at before
let alone try it out I was thinking
there's got to be some good products in
there so I basically went ham and CVS
let me tell you the drugstore is not
cheap anymore
when I got the receipt I was like in my
Sephora right now what is going on but
basically I did a full face look using
all hidden drugstore products obviously
the products that you have never noticed
before are going to be different for
different people
so all these products the ones that I've
never tried had never really even looked
at before so I'm putting them to the
test in this video doing a full phase of
first impressions on them I tried my
best to get a mix of different brands in
here products found a couple gems I'm
excited for you guys and see if you like
this video idea and you're excited to
watch because this video a thumbs up so
if you want to see how I got this look
using all random drugstore products
you're in the right place just keep
watching
alright let's dig in to my giant CVS bag
here I've already washed my face but
we're going to use the CVS brand makeup
perfecting face primer it says it
compares to L'Oreal studio secrets
professional magic perfecting base I've
definitely seen that L'Oreal one before
but I didn't know the CBS made like a
dupe RIT my skin has been getting bad
again I don't know what's going on like
you guys saw it was totally clear for
like a couple months and now it's racing
out again and I have some like big
cystic ones down here and I even have
some on my forehead which before I
didn't even get it on my forehead so who
knows man oh this is a total different
consistency than I was expecting
oh this is cool I thought it's going to
feel kind of like a moisturizer but this
is definitely more not silicone but it
just feels super super soft so it feels
good so I got a few different
foundations to try this one I'm really
interested in I'm not sure if this is a
powder or cream to powder but this is
the Revlon new complexion 1 step the
thing that drew me in about this one is
that it said it was full coverage on the
little display things I can give this
wing open if it is a powder I got two
other liquid options this is the all
made clear complexion for in one blemish
eraser and then L'Oreal visible lift
serum foundation I haven't heard a lot
about either of these products so I'll
probably be doing foundation Friday's on
them
the way this Dessay is supposed to cover
blemishes so I'm thinking this one might
have better coverage but it looks see
about coughing holy this is okay
this is a hella dark for me what did
they get their own shades no way in hell
this is the lightest shade zero one
ivory beige this is the lightest shade
it is a cream though so I'm not gonna
use it as a bronzer actually I'm going
to pop this back in return this thing
glad I got backups so I think I want to
try the all may one just because I
really want to see how much as covers
this is the lightest shade 100 i briefed
in the test i'll still acid in it which
i thought was really cool too looks like
a normal liquid consistency not too
thick not too runny I'm just going to go
in with my morphe 31 brush stipple this
guy on oh dude that is pretty good
coverage the shade of this is actually
looking like a really nice match right
now has a luminous finish we'll see the
dredge down a little bit I have a ton of
redness scarring acne right now so this
is actually covering much better than I
saw it I would say we're getting about
high medium coverage I really like the
shade of this the finish looks really
nice and like a side finish it's not
covering my major red acne spots off of
one layer but we can go on with
concealer okay I'm very pleasantly
surprised right now it looks really nice
it's sitting really nice on the skin
doesn't look textured anywhere if you're
new here I do tons of foundation videos
every Friday I do foundation Friday I do
a series 1215 days of foundation on my
channel this looks long you guys a lot
do you guys want to description box how
this one wears throughout the day so one
of the only concealers I found that I
haven't really heard a lot about is the
covergirl clean invisible concealer this
is in the shade 115 fair I'm hoping that
this is light enough it's not looking
too light I mean light drugstore
concealers is pretty tricky I usually
mix in the NYX lavender concealer that
really helps to lighten everything
polish and make sure this is good force
through on center my face
it feels really cooling feels kind of
cool oh no oh no what is happening hold
up maybe I need to blend my finger
okay this sets like super quick you
quickly blend this out with my finger
and if you guys saw that but it just
totally thought we
texture and like rubbed away the
foundation underneath whoa you guys see
this what is happening this dries in
about 0.2 seconds actually need to add a
little bit more to Center my fascia so I
can hopefully blend this out
this is weird even when I'm blending it
with my finger looking a little funky I
wonder if it's reacting weird with the
salicylic acid in the foundation
definitely don't like how quickly this s
but now that is under my eyes isn't
super brightening on my skin this is
almost the same shade as my foundation I
would probably pass on this one so I got
to powder options because I want to try
both of these at some point the first is
the Maybelline shine free oil control
loose powder this is another loose
powder this is the only smart shade 100
light pale this is cool because it's
supposed to be shade adjusting so I kind
of want to try this one we might just do
double on me right now I'll use this one
in a shadow and schmooze or something so
you can see what I think could get a
little puff and now that the
Foundation's been on for probably about
five minutes it still has a really
pretty luminous finish but it does feel
like it's starting to set a little bit
more I don't know what I'm setting my
under eyes lips didn't really think that
through I'm going to go into the morphe
e 44 brush it's kind of like a more firm
brush so I like it for powder to get all
the coverage out cam was pretty dark I
know when this is supposed to adjust you
can start any time do you see any
adjusting happening it looks and feels
really nice and smooth but it did just
take away the really pretty Phoenicia
has from the foundation okay this is the
only step I'm going to cheat a little
bit on I'm taking my position formula
powder just to set the under eye I think
we definitely need some brightening now
that my face cool dark looking alive
this one's for me since too dark I
probably won't wear this again but my
face does look very nice and smooth
eyebrows I got a couple different
products to try this is the wet and wild
color icon brow pencil which uses
brunettes do it better I use this before
I feel like I remember that name and
this is a Maybelline brow precise micro
pencil I usually really like some really
tiny
retractable kind of pencils so I think
I'm going with this this in the shade
255 soft brown when I first started
YouTube the maybelline pencil and like
the green with the
rain cap with my favorite and I look to
see if I could find it again they still
have it but I got rid of my one shade
that I used to use I used to really like
that one to get a little fully guy on
one end it doesn't feel quite as waxy
some of their pencils not bad but I
definitely like the LA girl new micro
brow pencil better than this so to
contour it I'm actually going to try
this mu a complete brow kit this is a
powdered brow product for pale skin a
lot of times the best option especially
at the drugstore should using an eyebrow
powder the elf eyebrow kit in the light
shade is amazing as a contour one of my
favorite contour products and this one
looks nice it doesn't look too ashy
hopefully I think this comes with a
little brow gel or something yes looks
like a clear brow gel let's you said
okay I'm obviously going in like this
lighter shade to contour let's hope this
isn't too ashy taking my wet wild
contour brush love this thing woo oh
yeah not too ashy not too warm you might
have found a winner folks like this one
will definitely reach for this again I
feel like one of the few blushes that I
hadn't tried from the drugstore was the
aimer smart shade powder blush it's in
the shade 20 nude mobs taking my morphe
Wi-Fi brush I think the gold collection
is back in stock I like these better
than the new elite collections they came
out with the red hair bristles these
feel almost exactly like the original
elite collection they also look like it
so I don't know let's just swirl oh
pretty all may look at you easy to blend
out I like the shade not too pink not
too mob purple if your skin tones a
little bit darker than mine you could
probably go in with Degas bottom two
shades and just skip the top lighter too
surprisingly I don't think I've ever
tried this is only using as a
highlighter and this is the physician's
form a powder palette mineral blow Pro
by Physicians Formula always have ten
thousand names for one thing this is in
the shade beige pearl since that powder
totally modified my face I'm going to go
to town with it highlighter and hope
it's good well whoa okay Hudson tense
I just got way too Mac yeah you need
like a tiny tiny bit of this this one I
think it just went a little ham but this
almost a little
a glittery fantasy my texture on my
cheekbone this side looks a lot more
natural na natural but less you know in
your face not that might be a little bit
glittery for my liking I feel like
people who like really really intense
highlights you probably love this I love
the Physicians Formula shimmer break
that is one my favorite favorite
products in natural nude it's amazing
alright on to the eyes for primer I'm
gonna be using this wet and wild little
pencil thing this is in the shade 130
pixie cream shadow pencil bring us a
little bit on the inner corner because
this is nice like light pink champagne
color it doesn't feel very cream at all
just kinda like a powder my actually put
this a little bit right under my brows
one will see how shadow blends on top
about right now I'm not super into it I
haven't heard anything about this the
anyway professional nude eyeshadow
palette this video I'm pretty sure the
first time trying anything from the MUA
brand they're a little bit on the
pricier side for the drugstore I think
this was like 15 or 20 bucks maybe so I
mean it's pretty much with the L'Oreal
eyeshadow palette are I'm pretty sure
they had on the had some like gem tones
in it or something but I just wanted to
do more of a neutral look today comes
with a brush not bad this would cover
like one tenth of your eyeball they
could use it for the inner corner
something imma start out with this new
where's my brush light nude shade right
here you could probably use the same
eyebrow products that I use for contour
so this just as well a little bit more
of a powdery eyeshadow it's like
brownish reddish shade looks kind of
pretty you might use that on the lid I
didn't want to actually put that into
the crease because it does look pretty
matte when you blend it out we'll just
do that
no not mat okay so I'm going to just
blend this onto my lid I'm gonna take a
little bit of this on my finger you see
oh yeah way better payoff with your
finger kind of want to do the note brush
challenge it just be really fun someone
tweeted me today a video of a girl doing
the dad does my voiceover video and I
think that I'll be frickin hilarious let
me know if you guys want to see that
when I go home my dad was probably love
doing that for you that I shed on the
bottom I'm going to use this Milani
supreme Kohl eyeliner never seen this I
really like the gold packaging though
eyes on the waterline really quick and
easily i'm going to tightline a little
bit the top
I'm going to blend that black eyeliner
out a little bit with the black shadow
in this palette I'm going to take that
second over brown shade right here is
they're blending really easily they're
tiny bit powdery for what I usually like
an eye shadow but they're blending out
early signs want that warmth down here
too so I'm going to take that same
reddish shade and just blend a little
bit for the price I think the wet and
wild eye shadows are better I only
picked up one liquid eyeliner so I'm
hoping this one works this is Revlon
Colorstay it's skinny and basically just
a liquid liner with a 0.1 millimeter
skinny tip hopefully I can win this
thing which me look because of how
flimsy this tip is is really hard to get
like a straight wing so I am going to be
putting falsies on but I want to do a
single coat of mascara before hands this
is the Rimmel volume colorist
so it has lashed in complex so it's
actually supposed to help tint your
lashes at the same time as like a tree
shaped kind of cone brush to it picked
Oromo mascara because I feel like a lot
of people are familiar with Maybelline
and covergirl mascaras not loving it not
hating it looks pretty average to me
always hard to see lashes when you have
a ton of eyeliner on they do it nice and
separated which I like but I know it's
like we got a whole lot of volume
speaking of volumes the lashes I'm going
in West are the Ardell make of volume
lashes c250
and they're actually doubled up lashes
there's like a lash on top of the lash
basically I almost went with anyway
lashes but when I lifted them up close
they look kind of cheap and the band's
look super sick nobody through a lot of
people have heard of ardell lashes but I
don't think I've ever actually tried to
double up kind okay all these are on I
like that these are dramatic but they're
still kind of wispy fluttery at the top
I'm going to time to use the same
mascara for my bottom lashes in my head
when I was shopping for all this I
thought I was going to do a very natural
eye that clearly didn't happen so I'm
hoping the lipstick options I have will
work I have the L'Oreal 6er one and new
ballet I don't think I've ever tried
this I don't remember this packaging at
all so this is actually like a liquid
lipstick / maybe even gloss Jessica
what am i doing doesn't say on here I
can remember if this is supposed to be a
liquid lipstick or a gloss smell the
interesting this is for sure it lipstick
this is the Loreal forever frappe 814 oh
it sounds like a brick red my other
option is kind of doing that foundation
lip and then putting this mu a gloss
over top which I kind of want to do it's
like a nude nude because it kind of cool
right now
to come and do that so since I don't
have a nude lipstick right now I'm
actually just going to put a tiny bit of
foundation on this concealer brush and
blend it on I'm going to first take this
glass and see how it looks and if I need
to warm it up a little bit
darken it I'll go in with this L'Oreal
one this shade it looks super pretty to
me this is the MUA luminizing lip gloss
and baby pink as soon as I saw this
through to my cart rare to see this
light of glosses smells like minty
temples well this is like circa 2010 I
mean it's a really light nude which is
awesome but I feel like since my face is
kind of dark right now it looks a little
intense totally into this color just
with the rest I think is a little bit
light right now so I'm going to add a
tiny bit of this L'Oreal
so this glides on a really nice doesn't
feel sticky at all and it has a really
nice sheen to it just want to keep
rubbing this on my lips I should really
like a shade of this - it's not - peach
not too pink in my because I have a
little bit of this mixed in with it so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
did make sure you give it a thumbs up it
helps me out I think I am most excited
about the foundation and then those two
last lip products I use also really like
the blush and the I broke as a contour I
think those are my top things out of all
