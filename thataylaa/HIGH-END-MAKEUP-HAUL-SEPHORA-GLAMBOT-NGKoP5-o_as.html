right halt so today we have a sephora
and random makeup all mostly sephora
I've been kind of going crazy online
sport lately I did just film my februari
raisin rejects so that's why we look the
same if you haven't seen that I'll link
it over here where we talk about what my
favorite products of the month I was
hard to get out let's just start I'm
gonna start with Sephora the first thing
is the NARS all day luminous weightless
foundation I posted a picture on my
Instagram of this and you guys wanted to
want to try it out this is in the shade
light one Siberia I'm actually wearing
it on my face right now I was gonna do
first impression on it but I don't know
I kind of like when I can try out a
foundation for a few days rather than
just giving you my thoughts within like
12 hours I feel like every foundation
applies differently and works better
with a brush or being a blender or
whatever and I just like to know those
things before I tell you to go do
something or buy it I will be making a
foundation review on this once I've
tried it out I do like the first
impression style of like checking in
throughout the day and showing you how
it applies and stuff so i'll probably do
that but just with a more what's the
word I'm looking for intense review so
Siberia is light enough for my face it's
kind of yellow it's actually very yellow
I think it's doable but it definitely is
the most yellow toned foundation that I
own if you want to see a full review on
this just let me know down below has a
pump I just had to mention it trying out
new foundations is like what really
makes me happy in life it's how I try
out new products for you guys and I just
like to see what's out there so that's
why I have an excessive amount
foundation this is the Make Up For Ever
HD foundation in the shade 110 I had a
sample size of this from Sephora and I
don't know if she gave me the wrong
shade but it was freaking dark so I'm
curious to see if this how this is I've
heard really good things about this is
supposed to be a pretty full coverage
and give like a nice flawless finish I
actually got this one off of glam buy it
was like ten dollars cheaper than was at
sephora so
not the last foundation that I picked up
is the Beca ultimate coverage complexion
cream this is in the shade porcelain
this was like one of those random
purchases where I was checking out on
sephora and decided to look at their
like bestseller new products or
something and I just came across this
and it got really good reviews I've
never heard anyone talk about it on
YouTube and it's supposed to be full
coverage the bottle I feel like is
really sleek I really like the packaging
kind of reminds me of our blast so I've
used this a couple times it's pretty
orange it's actually orange it can work
I probably will have to mix this in with
a lighter foundation but again I'll have
a whole like review and thoughts on this
coming up eventually let me know which
one of these foundations you guys would
want to see a review on first feel like
I just need to play around with this one
more and figure out the best way to
apply and they got the laura mercier
foundation primer and radiance I picked
up this one from Blaine bought the seals
are still on here I haven't used this
yet I've heard amazing things about this
primary like this is a lot of people's
like holy grail primer so I'm excited
tries out I picked up another one of the
a nostalgia beverly hills dipbrow pomade
this isn't shade granite it's what I
have with my brows right now I do have
dark brown or chocolate brown let's hope
i was using dark brown before and i
decided to pick up a granite because i
wanted something that was a little more
cool toned and just darker so you can
see maybe there you can kind of see the
difference to granite is definitely
darker i wish they made dark brown but
without like the readiness in it
sometimes it looks fine and sometimes I
just feel like my eyebrows look like
Auburn I really love these those what
I've been wearing on my brows every
single day next I got the kat von d
everlasting liquid lipstick in the shade
lolita i've had this on my like sephora
notifications you sign up to have them
email you with some things back in stock
and i put this on therefore i think like
two months
I got an email and I literally stopped
what I was doing I think I was like
mid-bite of cereal and never and over to
my computer and I gone on this stuff I'm
wearing on my lips right now it doesn't
look like what I was expecting it to
look like I thought it was going to be a
lot lighter I heard that they re not
reformulated it but like change the
color of Lolita and so the new ones are
a lot darker than they used to make them
kind of disappointing because this is a
totally different shade than I then I
thought it was going to be I still love
it I really like this like rusty red
kind of color but I just feel like I
have other lipsticks that are similar to
this which I was a little bummed out by
the color but everything else is really
nice I feel like it's a little bit more
dry than my stila patina that is my like
holy grail liquid lipstick right there
but so Sephora also threw in the benefit
roller lash mascara they have like a
bunch of the free deluxe itís sample
things that you can choose from and this
is one of them let's just take this out
I read a lot of stuff about this on like
Instagram and stuff so this would be a
super curling lifting mascara I have
never been a fan of high-end mascaras so
I'm curious to see how cute packaging oh
the brush looks like a smaller version
of my Maybelline lash sensational this
is my boy gril mascara it kind of looks
like just a smaller version of this
they're both curved you have like the
really small stiff bristles maybe you
like this then I got this NARS lip stick
from blam bought this is in the shade
carriage a few I have one of the other
knives lipsticks from glam ba as well
and i loved the consistency and
everything they're super matte and they
just go on so nicely and the packaging
it's just this is a super nice deep very
kind of red color when you layer it it
definitely looks just like a deep red
color but they're still very undertones
in there so I think the last two things
I got are these Tara tarina tarantino
I'm I just totally much of that these
are glitter liners I don't think I
ordered these from glam bah i think they
threw them in sometimes a throne
freebies if you purchase a certain
amount and I'm actually really obsessed
with this one this is in the shade
glitter miss I have it on my inner
corner on the bottom right now and when
it reflects the light it is like the
prettiest purpley pink color it is just
gorgeous and actually it is blackdiamond
and it's just a black glitter liner in
it's like okay but this one it's really
pretty so that was everything that I've
gotten recently from sporran glam but
not too much stuff but I felt like I
wanted to share with you guys because I
have some exciting videos coming up
using them if you like this video and
you want more haul videos give it a
thumbs up so I know I mentioned it in my
fabri weary raisin rejects video but I
did not do a tutorial on this look
because I was kind of unexpected just
kind of happened but if you want to know
the products that i used i will put that
in a blog post for you guys so you can
head over and check it out yeah love you
guys thanks for watching see you my next
video bye
