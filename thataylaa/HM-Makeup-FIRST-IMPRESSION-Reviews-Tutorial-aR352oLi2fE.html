makeup and it has black and gold
packaging so I obviously had to buy it
forever 21 came out with a makeup line a
few years ago and H&amp;amp;M just hopped on the
bandwagon that took me like five times
to say I picked up a few of their things
from the line
I ordered a lot more but I ended up
getting an email after I already made
the purchase saying that they were out
of stock so that was kind of annoying so
I have one two three four five products
I'm going to be talking about in this
video and I did do like a toriel on my
full face right now
it is on the pricier side for makeup
that I would expect from H&amp;amp;M most of
stuff is on like the higher end of
drugstore pricing feel like at that cost
like this stuff better be for kin
amazeballs if you guys want to hear my
thoughts and see how I did this makeup
you're in the right place just keep
watching alright so I already have my
foundation on and I didn't end up
picking up their foundation just because
I wasn't sure how the lighter shade was
going to be it looks super dark on the
website also it's $12.99
that's that's on like the higher end of
drugstore makeup right now I'm wearing
the a cosmetic CC cream mixed with the
new makeup from our HD foundation but I
did get the true matte finishing powder
by H&amp;amp;M I haven't tried this at all this
was $9.99 the packaging looks really
nice it's black and sleek just has gold
touches I have to say it does feel very
cheap like I don't you guys have hear
that but it just feels like you know
that makeup you get it for Christmas
when you're like 5 years old it's kind
of what it feels like it feels very
cheap ooh
it might be light enough so I got the
shade porcelain this looks like it could
be light enough see if I can find this
on the website claims to be a light
weight mattifying powder with fine
cashmere finish used to absorb shine and
set makeup suitable for normal to combo
skin I got this brush I don't think this
will be good too for the powder so we're
just going to go into my normal powder
brush I use this is by a cosmetics see
if I can avoid the brows I use the it
cosmetics cream today so we can see how
much it mattifies because this is a
pretty dewy foundation let's just go in
so it's definitely mattifying okay ash I
know my nose is completely gone and I
will see the forehead yeah
it definitely looks like I'm wearing a
powder it looks pretty cakey on my
forehead it did mattify it but not
loving the finish
I don't you guys can see that but it
does look pretty cakey on my forehead so
I got this buffer and blusher brush
I love how in the UK they say blusher it
feels really soft it has this tiny
angled end you can you might be able to
use this for like liquid foundation I'll
probably use this for a contour then you
could use this for blush or highlight or
whatever or bronzer you know it is soft
though so so far so good
did you have a bronzer but I didn't pick
it up so I'm just going to go in with
this huge like how freaking big is this
this is the it cosmetics vitality face
disk and I don't think I've really used
this that much I'm going to try this
bronzer and we'll see my p2 dark who
knows
so I'm going to sculpt out the
cheekbones at that end and you can't
really blend with that side so I'm going
to flip it over one this is nice for
like packing on the color but since it
is so firm it's a little bit difficult
to blend out I'll be use this for like
liquid foundation or maybe setting the
under-eye or something if you want a
super defined contour like look it is
super easy to get it in the right place
I'm not loving the way my skin looks at
all with this powder to be honest it's
starting to like crack around my mouth
in my nose area so for blush I picked up
their cantaloupe pure radiance powder
blush and I think they had a ton of
shades in this let me see yeah they have
ten shades of this blush and it retails
for $9.99 this is what the shade looks
like it's a super nice kind of melon
color and I have already use this once
or twice and I do really like this blush
I think it's a beautiful color so I'm
going to go in with this brush I haven't
applied it with this brush yet I'm just
gonna blend away this one doesn't have a
mirror on it by the way I do really like
the color I think this is a beautiful
shade where it's like not too orange II
just the right amount of peach you know
what I'm saying I'm using way more than
I usually do with this brush I feel like
it's kind of just like not really
placing the product very well I usually
only have to go in like once or twice
but I'm putting a ton on with this brush
for highly I think I'm just going to
wipe off this contour and and use this
brush for a highlight and see how that
works I'm gonna go back in with this
highlight from the disk thing and we're
just gonna kind of pounce this on the
top of the cheekbones oh yeah
we're going to tiny a bit a bit whoa I'm
gonna run a tag a bit of this down the
bridge of my nose and my Cupid's bow I
would say it's a little bit too firm to
apply a highlight
I will try using it under my eyes next
time so I want to prime the eyes with
Mac's painterly paint-pot mine is like
frickin dried up I really need to get a
new one of these I think I might go a
soft ochre this time it's like the
yellowy perversion so I originally
ordered a whole eye shadow palette on
hmmm and I was going to do a whole eye
look with it and then I
an email after the saying that I was out
of stock and they had already processed
the rest of my order so that was great I
only ended up getting one single eye
shadow from them but from a couple of
the reviews that I could find it said
that the single eye shadows were
actually like the best ones and you want
to try out one of their eyeshadow
palettes they're just out of stock right
now so for the majority of the eye
shadows I'm going to be using naturally
pretty palette weight cosmetics I think
I use this like awhile ago in a video
but I haven't really touched it since
first I'm going to go on the shade sheer
glow which is like the lightest just
neutral shade in the palette and I'm
just going to set that primer kind of
all over and this will just make it
easier to blend everything out next
we're going to go in with the shade
sunrise which is one of my favorite
shades in this palette it's like this
it's like a warm brown and I'm going to
blend this into the crease I'm just
gonna do a super quick and easy kind of
eye I'm not really doing anything today
I'm just like editing I kind of want to
use this purple though this allheart
shade looks really pretty
should we do that maybe the H&amp;amp;M shade I
got is Dover just as like white shimmery
shades so we'll probably use this on the
inner corner well it looks really
glittery should we do that yeah I'm
gonna go in with that allheart shade and
I think this is purple I really know ooh
that's pretty
we're just going to blend this all over
the lid ooh that's really pretty
alright I'm feeling that color I really
like that what are we doing I'm going to
blend sunrise again on the lower lash
line and try not to get in my book now
I'm going to go with that H&amp;amp;M shade and
we're just going to put this on the
inner corner I think super glittery but
I kind of like it actually like how it's
not super white but you can still see
those glittery flecks going on I
wouldn't say this is super pigmented
I'll swatch it for you guys it is a
little bit flaky in there so they're
single eyeshadows retail for $6.99 I
definitely would not pay $6.99 for these
I think Milani makes a lot better at
single eyeshadows I probably pay max too
for this maybe a dollar so I did pick up
their liquid eyeliner they have a few
different ones on there this is the
precision eye marker and it says it's
supposed to be a silky black liquid
eyeliner with long lasting smudge proof
formula blah blah blah let's do it so it
looks like it's felt-tip and it has a
pretty nice fine point goes on really
nice and matte black so far so good I'm
actually really impressed with this
eyeliner super easy to make the wing
because it has a really fine point and
just glide it on pretty easy and it
looks super black and just matte and I'm
feeling it for mascara I'm going to go
in with my Holy Grail Too Faced better
than sex mascara this stuff is frickin
amazeballs if you don't have it you
should go buy it
howsabout every night they have a few
different lipstick formulas that they
came out with I ordered two of the
liquid lipsticks and both of them ended
up being sold out I don't have any of
their lipsticks to try out for you guys
but I definitely want to try out their
liquid ones
alright so my camera battery just died
but all I did was put on LeBeau
cosmetics liquid lipstick and this is in
the shade Lexi and love with these
liquid lipsticks you'll probably see
this in my raves and rejects video this
month I am out of breath right now love
this shade I think it's a perfect like
natural a little bit darker nude feels
good on the lips love it the only things
I think you should spend your money on
out of the stuff I tried is the
precision eye maker a liquid eyeliner
and this is a good liquid eyeliner we'll
see how it wears throughout the day and
then I love the blush like I'll probably
end up buying a couple more shades of
their blushes just because I love this
color I love the way it blends out I
wouldn't recommend applying it with that
brush I think I just wasted way too much
product if you guys have tried out
anything from the H&amp;amp;M cosmetics line let
me know down below let me know if I
should pick anything else up if you guys
like this video and you want to see more
first impression kind of videos give it
a thumbs up so I don't love you guys
thanks for watching and see you my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
