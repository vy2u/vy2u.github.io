sitting out for like 35 days
all right so today we're gonna be trying
out hot topic makeup I just think of
like seventh-grade black and white
checkers remember those band things that
would like twist around themselves they
still make those those were kind of cool
so Hot Topic carries makeup they don't
have full on like full face kind of
makeup they didn't have foundation
concealer that kind of stuff but I did
get a ton of palettes we have like
10 pallets here some lip products lashes
when I ordered all this stuff they're
having some kind of sale so I got like a
couple bucks off each thing but for the
most part I feel like it's a little bit
overpriced especially for the kind of
branded like Nickelodeon or Disney
products which makes sense those kind of
things are always overpriced because
people will buy it regardless even their
other makeup that's like the Hot Topic
brand is a tiny bit pricey in my opinion
like there are some things that were
like thirteen fourteen dollars I'll have
everything I tried out link down below
but if you're excited for this video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up I
really appreciate it if you're new here
you can join the baby toe family and
subscribe I upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time and
when you guys are seeing this video I'm
pretty sure the 15 days the foundation
announcement video is gonna be coming
very soon so keep an eye out for that if
you want to see me put some Hot Topic
makeup on my face and how I got this
look you're in the right place just keep
watching alright so have my base on
brows bronzer concealer because they
didn't have any of those things on the
site they also didn't have blush but I
kind of want to attempt to use an
eyeshadow as a blush so I got I mean I
should have cost a kit I got three
eyeshadow palettes I might kind of mix
and match some of these so they do you
want to try all of them the first one is
the Manic Panic
amplified here's what the shades look on
the inside I think that would be a
really pretty blush shade I also have
another potential blush shade in the
galactic cosmic eyes shadow palette by
Blackheart so it seems like Blackheart
is kind of their brand because it does
say Hot Topic Blackheart on here double
the plastic thing on all these but light
year that might be good blush shade
maybe possibly even mixed in with a
little bit of this one to kind of tone
down that pink and I may also have a
third palette this is the Nickelodeon
eyeshadow palette this one I don't think
we have a blush shade that could work
I'm gonna see what this cotton candy
situation is that wouldn't feel soft too
that might be a really pretty blush I'm
gonna do that when you use an eyeshadow
palette as a blush or highlight it's
kind of tricky to only get one shade
when the pans are this small so I
usually kind of
squeeze my brush like that just to dip
in I'm gonna brush a little bit on the
back of my hand just kind of even it out
and then let's play oh that looks pretty
I mean it looks pretty glowy so it's
definitely emphasizing my texture right
there when it hits the light but it
doesn't look bad and it's a pretty color
for blush also blending out nice and
easily to her face Haley I got this look
how freakin cool this packaging is this
is the black art saturn's glow
intergalactic highlight palette this
outside packaging is so cool I did open
this to take off the plastic packaging
and the only thing is that look at how
far this bends up it only goes up not
even about halfway so you really got it
like this is a workout trying to lift
this thing up you can see it already
kind of ripping right there but here's
what those highlight shades look like
you get five shades so this white one
looks like it has a little bit of like
bluish reflect to it and then let's
swatch the one next to it
ooh that looks pretty it's actually like
a really light tannish champagne there's
a pink one next to it that also looks
pretty I'm actually feeling these two
darker ones not the white one because
that does look more blue but I might use
that as eyeshadow or something I cleaned
my makeup desk for the first time last
night and like forever because I'm
pre-recording shit-ton and just turns
into a disaster you can see the table
I'm trying to like put things away as I
use them so I'm gonna first take that
lightish tan shade see how this does oh
dang I mean you can definitely see my
pores and it is emphasizing my texture a
little bit but it has a really pretty
metallic effect to it it's not glittery
I mean that is not a bad highlight at
all I'm gonna add in a little bit of
that pink wow this is good intense I'm
gonna tone this down with some powder
after woah I'm just putting this right
on the high point not bringing it down
this far very intense highlight right
now I'm gonna go in with my blush brush
and just tone this down a little bit
blend it in I'm usually more into like a
subtle yet reflective highlight but I
like this and if you're someone who
likes that really how highlight I mean
this is really pretty it's a highlight
if I really need to tone something
I just go in with my powder brush that I
use for underneath my eyes I'll just
kind of tap it over so I'm gonna go in
with my usual eye primer I didn't see an
eyeshadow primer on there this is Mac's
Paint Pot in soft ochre so I use every
single day I'm testing a new eyeshadow
palette or something I like using this
because I know how it is I have no idea
what look I want to go for looking at
all three of these palettes I'm kind of
thinking of a bright blue purple kind of
thing because I have a shimmery blue in
this shade also shimmery purple in the
Nickelodeon palette there's a matte blue
which would be nice to use and the
Galactic there's also a shimmery blue
shade right here looks like matte purple
and then kind of a deeper blue shade
right here there's a light kind of tan
shade in the Manic Panic palette but it
seems to be a shimmery yet shimmery so
it's not something I would use in my
crease the only matte tan shade in any
of these palettes is this one in the
Nickelodeon looks pretty light like it's
probably a color I would use all over my
lid
but oh yeah okay well I'm gonna blend
this and I'll probably blend some
bronzer into the crease since there's
not another shade we're gonna use the
same product I use for bronzer today
which is the bare minerals blush in the
shade beige for days I'm gonna take the
shade a football head that blue in the
Nickelodeon palette and I'm gonna put
this into the crease showing up a bit
more dark than I was expecting
looks like a very bright blue in the pan
but maybe we just have to build this on
it yep shade looks a little bit muddy or
something actually taking quite a while
to blend out I think I've been trying to
blend this for like four minutes at this
point I rediscovered the Vera moana
color switch which is basically just
like a sponge I mean you can get these
on wish for like a dollar now but I've
had this for so long like since they
first launched before Sephora but I
literally haven't used this in years I
totally forgot about it and use this
between eyeshadows it just like takes it
all off your brush they can also be
helpful if you have a color like this
where you want to use the same brush to
blend but you want the product off of
your brush you don't want to keep
depositing it on your eyes so I'm just
and there you go the blue is off seems
to be almost like stuck there now it
doesn't really want to blend out anymore
so we're gonna come back to that this is
the blue nebula in the Galactic palette
let's see the shimmery one and Manic
Panic Nebula definitely looks a little
bit less chalky here's a nebula here's
Manic Panic I want to try and put this
blue all over my
with my finger yeah I'm gonna do I'm
gonna do that when I first put this down
it's not crazy how different colors look
the way you apply them this is the same
color that I just put my crease so I'm
gonna pack this down first and then put
that shimmery blue right on the center
feels nice and soft this highlight is
growing on me and I'm gonna fill in
those areas where I couldn't reach with
my fingers easily I definitely have a
lot of blue fallout right there yeah
when you blend this shade it gets kind
of weird and patchy okay totally weird
and patchy doesn't really want it here
at all I wish you could see my table
right now it's literally just flying off
of the brush on the table like there's a
big pile of blue powder let's go in with
nebula from the Galactic palette and I'm
gonna wet my brush for this one ooh that
looks really dusty and put this right on
this Center there we go I kind of feel
like an ice skater or something by the
way did you see the documentary is
coming out about what's her face and her
boyfriend famous ice skater whoo that
looks pretty on top of there definitely
helping to cover up some of the
patchiness we had going on these blue
edges need some work
so I'm gonna go back with the bronzer
shade to hopefully blend that out a
little bit hoping this doesn't get
totally patchy again
okay I'm googling this girl's name Tonya
Harding that's it thank you google okay
hi shadow well this white shade in the
Nickelodeon palette is very stiff and
super chalky looks like there's actually
a matte white in the Manic Panic let me
go on with that highlight palette and I
want to take the white shade that had
that blue kind of reflect to it I'm
gonna try and put that right on the
inner corner like why even put a mirror
on here if you can't bend it back far
enough to see her face I'm getting a
really good view of the shadows here
thank you for that whoops just got a
shadow all over the mic thank all of my
camera supplies have either eyeshadow
foundation concealer it happens nothing
too special there I'm gonna wet it
okay there we go I don't see any matte
dark shade in any of these there's no
black but I'm seeing and there's also no
dark brown or any kind of really dark
shade I think the dark is to have this a
dark purple okay there's actually this
really pretty deep I don't even know
this is it almost looks like a purple
gunmetal but it's pretty dark
it is a shimmer it's not matte but I
think I'm gonna run this on the lower
lash line this is Raven from the Manic
Panic
palette oh I like that they have a nice
little quote on there for you the Korea
demonic panic agreed I'm just gonna
blend that out with the same shade just
tap a little bit more just kind of smoke
it out so this is their double eyeliner
by the Blackheart brand again thick and
there's a thin side eyes are kind of
burning right now I feel like it didn't
start until I put that Manic Panic one
on the lower lash line and they look
pretty red I don't know if you guys can
see on camera but they're definitely
like bloodshot right now my eyes get
really sensitive to certain eyeshadow
palettes there's certain urban decay
ones that totally wreck my eyes I don't
know which ingredient it is I haven't
been able to like nail that down yet see
the thick wow that is that is thick
here's the thick side of that liner and
then there's the thin side the thin side
still looks pretty dang thick to me
this is hella long look at how friggin
long that thing is I'm so confused this
is like an inch long need some eyedrops
up in here but the show must go on
so here we go wow you've got a press to
get that out maybe it just needed to get
started I feel like in the last couple
months my lids have gone even saggy er
than normal for some reason so doing a
wing has been such a struggle because as
I'm doing it looks totally normal and
I'm like holding my eye like this and
then as soon as I drop it to normal I
mean what is that the struggle man I
mean look how much different your makeup
looks if you have lids so this feels
super stiff and product only comes out
like half the time feels like an
eyeliner that's been sitting out for
like 35 days I'm gonna try the thick
side just to get a little bit more color
out like what is that it looks like a
friggin tadpole don't judge my island
right now it's my ice vault
okay now it's not coming out at all
this isn't now okay well it legit just
dried up so I'm gonna switch Islanders
because I gotta finish that wing I just
touched it up with some cap on V liner
they had false lashes on there and these
ones look pretty nice these are the
saucy lashes apparently they're faux
mink lashes a good thing about lashes is
that they cover up a lot of your effed
up liner oh these are gonna be pretty
okay I'm gonna trim these down pop them
on and I'll be right back so my lashes
are on and I am so freakin pumped about
these lashes I feel like this is
everything I want in a dramatic lash
they have tons of volume at the base but
then they're still fluffy and separated
and they're not too long which is what I
find with a lot of lashes for my eyes
they just like go up to my brows a lot
of the times and these are the castor
style I don't think I said that and as I
was putting these on waiting for the
glue to dry I was looking up a little
bit about this brand and they are
cruelty free and I looked on their
Instagram and it seems like they're kind
of like a smaller indie brand so good
for them for getting into Hot Topic and
we decided to try more of these and I'm
gonna order more of these right after I
film this it says they're lightweight
and have a flexible band they have the
same kind of band as like I'll or or the
peer ones which I clearly don't mind
because those are two of my favorite
lashes I don't mind a thicker band but
for what I like and for what I look for
I am in love with these so I'm super
excited this is what I love about
filming these kind of videos even if
it's like Claire's or Hot Topic or
whatever it is
there's usually at least one thing that
I find that gets me really excited and
if I didn't do videos like this I
wouldn't find this product alright so
the last thing we're moving on to lip
products I got a few different lip
things first is the Disney Belle matte
liquid lipstick collection looks like
there's three in here and this is again
the Blackheart semi matte highly
pigmented plush liquid lip this looks
like a nude this is in the shade 0-1
let's see what shades are in the belting
oh heck yeah it looks like there's a
nice light nude and pump to use this
okay I should have showed you that
before I just totally destroyed that
packaging you get a bright red
definitely not trying to be 4th of July
today so I'm not gonna use that one but
then you get two nude shades which look
like nice kind of cool tones this one
looks like a really pretty color so I
might layer this on top of this one
because I do want to try this too
the packaging on these are super cute
the Rose lid and
sunburst applicator feels super cheap
and it doesn't get a whole lot of
product out not into the sin it's just
like the kind of classic cheap candy
scent really pretty color though and
it's going on very smooth feels very
lightweight doesn't feel too drying
actually feels very soft and velvety
definitely still feels a little bit wet
not wet you can just feel it kind of
like the NYX soft matte lip creams if
you like cool tones and nudes though
that shade is really pretty I'm gonna do
a little kiss test because this feels
like it's in transfer does say it's semi
matte yeah totally transfers it might
just be one that takes a little bit
longer to dry down or maybe doesn't dry
down like the NYX soft matte lip creams
it feels comfortable let's layer this
thing on top though this isn't enchanted
oh wow major chemicals know this right
on the center I think that looks nice
with the other shade this just is kind
of warming it up a tiny tiny bit I feel
like that one just made my lips look
super creepy this one's more of like a
matte liquid lipstick that's gonna dry
down versus this one it does say this is
a plush liquid lip so I don't think this
is supposed to totally dry down matte
this seems to be drying down darker it's
been on for a couple minutes now it
almost has darkened which is a little
bit odd this feels really nice I would
totally wear this again alright so this
is the final look let's just quickly run
through the hits and the misses so
obviously in the nickelodeon palette i
only tried a couple the shades i would
definitely pass on the blue obviously
made it work and it's pretty few packet
on the lid but it just kind of flies off
all over the place and it's also really
tricky to blend out I do think the
packaging and everything of this is fun
and if you were a Nickelodeon person
growing up I don't know might be a fun
thing to like have in your collection
this copper is pretty though let me
swatch a few more the copper soft but
then like Samsung that's a samsung no
smashing smashing is a little bit chalky
feeling oh that green feels like
sandpaper see the orange the orange is
really soft but it is chunky though look
how powdery that is the black hard
galactic palette let's watch a few more
but the ones that i've swatched so far
and then the ones that I used seemed
pretty nice so there's a few more
swatches this shimmer shade aurora
definitely looks a bit chalky the matte
shades feel really soft and look pretty
pigmented I feel like this one is the
kind of thing where it's not bad and if
you're really
to aliens or something or you just
really like the packaging then maybe you
would like this but it definitely feels
pretty cheap I mean it's like cheap
cardboard and I wouldn't say the
eyeshadows are particularly great
quality or anything but you can make it
work the highlight palette is actually
kind of fun the shades that I used if
you like that really intense highlight
it looks pretty nice in real life you
can definitely see my texture quite a
bit so I probably wouldn't wear it as
like an everyday highlight but if I'm
doing a full and look and I want a
really intense highlight it's pretty a
Manic Panic amplified like I said I
think something in these my eyes are not
quite enjoying just is kind of like
nothing special to me mattes aren't
particularly soft and pigmented and the
shimmer is same thing I think the thing
I'm most excited about is definitely the
lashes saucy lashes and then this liquid
lipstick absolutely
saucy lashes so that's everything I'll
have everything linked down below if you
want to check anything out but I hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you did
