right so today of this foundation Friday
happy foundation Friday this is what I
do a new first impression video every
single Friday on my channel today we're
talking about a Korean product this is
the Holika Holika Holika Holika aqua
petit jelly bb's is technically a BB
cream look at this packaging this is the
cutest freakin packaging I've ever seen
in my life this is a frosted glass
bottle you have a cute polka dot lid and
then there's a spatula one applicator
one of you guys recommended this in the
comments a long time ago on a video and
I've had this in my foundation to review
a pile for forever apparently this is
one of Korea's most popular foundation
BB products I also have the Holika
Holika cover and hiding liquid concealer
here that were going to be trying out so
I have the claims compiled from a bunch
of random sites it's not as a lot of
information on this product in English
online so this is what I have found from
scavenging this is a water-based BB
cream it contains 80% aqua mint water
does have SPF in it it's SPF 20 it says
on the box so you get one point three
five ounces of product in here which is
a lot more than a standard foundation
one fluid ounce retails for any we're
kind of between the ten and twenty
dollar range depending on where you get
it I got this on Amazon for about twelve
bucks
prices on Amazon always fluctuate so you
can find us on I hope they have it on I
herb for about ten bucks
similes link to this on Amazon and I
hope down below downside this only comes
in two shades which it seems like it's
pretty normal for Korean BB creams
especially so if you don't have a fair
complexion this product probably won't
work for you unfortunately
alright so swatch time here is the
Holika Holika BB in the shade zero one
next over is the leo le BB cream in the
lightest shade which is obviously way
too dark I do have to mix this one but
it's one of my favorite BB creams here's
German called 2:08 this pretty much an
exact match for me and then next over is
their bin Decay Naked skin foundation in
0.5 and then last is josie maran argan
foundation in our g5 so this water-based
BB cream is a hit product in Korea and
works well for a combination oily skin I
do have combination skin I
get oily throughout the day on my t-zone
because it has a wonderful jelly texture
that helps make up spread more evenly
leaving your skin looking dewy hydrated
and flawless has great coverage and
comes in two shades 0 1 &amp;amp; 0 2 I have the
shade zero one here apparently the shade
zero one aqua beige is more for people
with cooler undertones and zero to aqua
natural is for warmer undertones
made from various fruit extracts and
Alaskan glacial water there are some
interesting ingredients in here there's
a low peppermint and also hyaluronic
acid and glycerin so those are all the
claims on this guy I'm going to leave my
foundation Friday playlist down below if
you want to go watch other foundation
Friday videos after this one when you
guys are seeing this video I'm actually
going to be in Houston with Mallory
17:12 I am so excited I'm not sure if
we're doing a meet-up she's like
recovering from surgery right now so it
really just depends on how she's feeling
so I know a bunch of you guys live in
Houston so we might do a meet-up
I don't know we'll see let me know down
below if you're in the Houston area and
you would be able to attend to meet up
this weekend if you want to see how this
product applies when we're throughout
the day you're in the right place just
keep watching okay so it is 1018 in the
morning and last night I went on this
YouTube Canon 70d spree and learned all
this about my camera that I never
knew existed so I think I've been doing
it wrong for a while my ISO was way too
high the apertures now lower camera
thing so hopefully the quality looks
better right now
so I've already washed moisturize and
prime my face use my Joey anti blemish
matte primer it comes with this sponge I
don't know if your swish to dampen or
not feels pretty firm so on one side of
my face i'm using my morphe e31 brush
and then on the other side this nyx
sponge this is a new sponge I used in a
drugstore first impressions video I've
been liking this not sure if I like it
more than the Real Techniques sponge yet
but it's good I'm going to give this a
shake and it's supposed to be like a
jelly formula like a pudding whoa it
actually looks like pudding you guys a
close-up yeah it literally looks like
pudding in there like Wiggles so it
comes with this little spatula I have
about a quarter sized amount out on this
palette it does like peek like whipped
cream when you touch it
alright let's do this whoa it smells
like um what is that scent sounds like
some lotion I have it feels a little bit
cooling it's got too much
I'm just going to spread that over my
forehead I guess I'm not going to use
their sponge just because I have other
expunges I can use so off of that one
layer what's a brash is looking like
light coverage almost medium coverage I
think if we build this up we can get it
to medium coverage but my acne and
scarring down here is still definitely
coming through it feels like nothing
whoa that's just totally set into my
skin feels really nice so let's dab a
little on the other side and then blend
with a sponge
I'm definitely getting less coverage
with a sponge didn't cover that is acne
down here as well as on this side and it
looks really light coverage with the
sponge I can't put my finger on this
smell I would say sheer coverage with
the sponge and light coverage with the
brush on one layer it sets very quickly
I would say within about 30 seconds it's
totally set which is great my skin looks
like a natural glow right now which I
like it doesn't look too overly
illuminating but it also doesn't look
super matte my forehead it looks a
little bit textured on some of my dry
patches up here I did use that whole
amount that I put out on the palate so
I'm going to add a bit more for a second
layer and I'm just going to go in with
that same brush for a second layer I
like the way it applied way better with
a brush shade I think is spot on if it
doesn't oxidize I think this shade is
actually perfect
I love the lio le BB cream and that one
has a bit more coverage in this that one
is way too dark size to mix it but the
coverage on the Leo le is awesome I had
their favorite BB cream or CC cream is a
American brand a cosmetic CC cream that
has a freaking amazing coverage and I
feel like my skin really likes that
product like doesn't break me out or
anything I feel like I can't get totally
smooth application with the brush so I'm
just going to go back and smooth it out
with the sponge after so with two layers
I would say low medium coverage it looks
really nice and natural though the only
area I'm not loving is my forehead is
clinging to sound drat drat patches dry
patches on my forehead so I'm not sure
if you have a dry skin if this one would
work out it does say online that it's
more for humble oily skin so I have
their liquid concealer here cover and
hiding is what it's called and this was
in the lightest shade if I'm gonna use
this for under my eye
and probably the spot conceal a little
bit too because I want to see if we can
cover the scarring and stuff a little
bit blend that out I'm going to go on
with my G 38 and this side I'm going to
take my finger and two salons out a
little bit differently it's a very
illuminating concealer like my under
eyes look very glowy right now for my
skin tone I think the shade is a bit
dark it didn't do a whole lot of
brightening so you can still see some
freckles coming through like on my under
eyes so see if it covers any of the
scarring in acne it is helping to cover
some of the acne a little bit but it's
not totally full coverage covering it
like you can't see it the center of my
forehead is not looking great so between
the concealer and the foundation we are
at solid medium coverage now you can
still see freckles and stuff coming
through which can be nice if you're like
more natural looking products so I'm
going to go ahead and do the rest of my
makeup and I will be right back okay so
it's now at 10:55 so we're calling the
check-in time 11 o'clock so I did that
in the setting my face with a powder
mostly because I wanted to smooth out my
forehead a little bit and also add a
little bit of coverage if I could and I
definitely like the way it's looking
right now a lot better with this powder
use my cosmetics celebration foundation
elimination one my favorite powder is my
forehead looks way better much more
smooth right now it did add a little bit
of coverage everything right now is
looking really nice and smooth around my
nose I'm hoping it's not going to crease
it looks like it might there but we'll
see I think if you have dry skin this
might cling to some of your patches just
because it did with me and I have very
minimal patches on my forehead but I
tell you what's on the rest of my face
so for contour I used the shade from the
Physicians Formula palette that I loved
blush is also Physicians Formula this is
their new butter blush in natural glow
also love this but it makes me feel like
I need to be on a vacation so highly I
was watching this for actually for
eyeshadow and I felt like this would be
a nice highlight and I actually really
like this it's a super natural highlight
no glitter or anything this is the
Maybelline eye shadow in seashell pretty
powdery but besides that it makes a nice
highlight I also use that on my lids a
little bit and then I put one of the
color pop eyeshadows in my crease what
is Bellaire from colour-pop colour-pop
ultra matte in naughty with
Jordana buttercream frosting just but
that kind of on
my lips so I'm going to go about my day
it is actually a Friday the previous
Friday when I'm filming this so I have a
bunch of work to do I need to do some
laundry next check and I do will be in
natural lighting so I'll see you guys in
a few hours all right so it's now 347 in
the afternoon so it's been on for almost
five hours I'm holding the mic right now
so hopefully last time I did a check in
out here I realized the sound was like
super far away so I'm holding the mic
hopefully this was good so I have my
mirror here I was out running errands
and someone in Walgreens actually conv
complimented me on my makeup and I don't
think it was my like eyes or lips
because there's not a whole lot going on
so I think they were talking about my
face makeup and it does look really nice
even in the car mirror which it usually
looks like crap in the car mirror my
skin looked really nice and smooth it
just looks kind of like plump and
healthy so let's get very up close like
I just feel like my forehead
now with that a cosmetics powder on
looks super nice and smooth and getting
a little bit of creasing on my upper lip
but nothing bad right now pretty under
eyes I don't like this concealer I feel
like it's kind of worn off a little bit
I look like I have no coverage under my
eyes right now and it is creasing a bit
so I would say for me it's a pass on the
concealer but right now five hours in I
am liking how my skin looks so I'm going
to edit I'm getting ahead on videos
right now for when I'm going to be in
Houston so I have four videos to edit so
I'm going to get started on that and I
would check back in with you guys at the
end of the night it is now 8:25 so
pretty much 8:30 so it's been on for
about nine and a half hours if I'm doing
that math right yes so I was tempted to
check in a few different times
throughout this day because I am shocked
I'm shocked at how good it looks by the
way I have eyeliner on because I'm about
to go out right now you wouldn't know by
the sweatshirt and yoga pants but made
the effort for winged liner so as I was
looking at it throughout the day I mean
it has not broken down pretty much
anywhere in the center of my forehead my
forehead it just looks really good it's
just totally still on upper lip around
my nose looks a little bit heavy like
normal on me by the end of the night but
nothing bad at all for someone like me
who gets oily throughout the day and you
like lighter medium coverage to me you
have to really
on a lot and build this up to get medium
coverage so if you like more light
coverage and want something that just
looks really natural and glowy and wear
throughout throughout the day you might
like this since this doesn't have enough
coverage for me I think this is a
perfect one to mix it with something
like the Marke shake is remarkable where
I just need a bit more coverage but I
want it to last all day and look smooth
and nice so I'm about to go out I do not
plan on changing right now I'm literally
going to put on a vest
Friday night getting wild if you guys
