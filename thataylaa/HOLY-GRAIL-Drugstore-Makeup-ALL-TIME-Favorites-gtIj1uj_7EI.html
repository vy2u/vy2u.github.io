talking about one of my favorite things
in life drugstore makeup I have a few
similar videos to this but I can't
believe I've never actually done a
favorite drugstore makeup video or like
Holy Grail makeup from the drugstore all
the years have been on YouTube I have
two different drugstore makeup starter
kits so if you're stumbling across this
video in your beginner I'd recommend
going and watching those videos because
that's a good kind of starting point if
you just go into the drugstore and
you're kind of lost and confused in the
world those videos should help you out I
had a good reflection sesh on the plane
for an hour and a half and thought about
what are my actual true Holy Grail
drugstore products I've been using for
years some of these products I've
literally been using for over six years
seven years some of them are newer if
you've been following my channel for a
while you can probably guess like 80% of
these but I think some of them I use a
lot and just don't ever talk about on my
channel or their favorites from like
years ago and I still consider them
awesome products I just I'm constantly
trying out different things I am someone
who believes that makeup is makeup
there's amazing high-end makeup there's
amazing drugstore makeup the price tag
shouldn't define whether product is good
or not I found a lot of drugstore
products that are better than high-end
and vice versa so I just feel like just
go into the drugstore with an open mind
and don't forget to coupon because
drugstores put every brand on sale they
just rotate it out throughout the week
so you can save a lot of money if you
learn how to coupon at the drugstore I
used to be super into couponing if you
watch me like three or four years ago I
coupon like every day I was hardcore
into it and I've toned it down a little
bit but it's just a super easy way to
save someone you have the drugstore
alright let's get into the video if you
guys are excited for this make sure you
give it a thumbs up while you're
watching this let me know your favorite
drugstore products down below so I tried
to kind of pick one or a couple products
from each kind of category so I'm just
going to go through them all all the
products I'm talking about are going to
be linked down below in the description
box I think we're going to start off
with foundation because that's my
favorite thing in life this eyelash is
not cooperating today pretty much
nothing is cooperating today I'm just
have
one of those days all right so I have
four foundations to talk about which is
a little bit excessive but I like each
one for different purposes so if you
have pale skin and all-over favorite
foundation of mine which i think is just
awesome is the Rimmel lasting finish 25
our comfort serum foundation in the
shade 91 light ivory I love how this is
25 hours you can just do 24 I feel like
this is such an underrated product if
this didn't break me out I would wear
this every single day it lasts
beautifully throughout the day through
working out through sweating pretty much
anything I love the shade of it on me I
did a full review on this foundation
which I'll link down below I have
combination skin with cystic acne I like
a more full coverage foundation it
covers everything I need to cover but I
could also see this working really well
for someone with dry skins it does have
this like gel like kind of formula
everyone's skin reacts differently to
different products so my skin personally
doesn't like Rimmel products there were
most stay matte powder breaks me out try
this out if it breaks you out stop using
it if not I'm jealous so when I think to
like my back in the day holy grail
foundation it is definitely the
maybelline superstay foundation now I
don't use this at all anymore since I
don't self tan and the lightest shade is
extremely dark I think this is actually
the second to lightest shade because the
lighter shade is more orangie and this
one is more beige I kind of want to try
and mix this in with stuff now because I
haven't used this in probably I don't
even know a year or two but I used to
use this every single day when I was
self-tanning finish of it kind of
reminds me of the l'oreal true match
foundation it has a super nice satin
finish but this is a lot more
long-lasting in my opinion this has
awesome coverage if you're not pale try
this out if you are pale this will be
way too dark but you could try mixing it
in with other stuff last foundation I
want to mention is just for mixing
purposes for me I don't like this one
alone but the hard candy glamoflauge in
the shade porcelain is awesome for
mixing in to lighten your foundations if
you're someone who wants a drugstore
foundation but you struggle with finding
one that's light enough try mixing this
in you can get this out Walmart for like
six bucks also if you have super pale
skin if your lighter
me I have a full video on foundations
that are too late for me first I'm going
to talk about what I use to set my under
eyes if you just found my channel this
year you probably only see me as a
stargazer powder but before that for
years I've been using the Physicians
Formula translucent light setting powder
to set the under eyes if you're really
pale you could use this as an all-over
face powder for me this works awesome to
set my under eye concealer it's light
enough it's super hard finding a powder
at all drugstore or high-end that's
actually light enough and this one is
Physicians Formula always does buy one
get one free and 40% off so just wait
till all these drugstore brands go on
sale I use I heart CVS and I think the
other ones just I heart rite-aid calm
and they basically put out the weekly
ads a few weeks in advance so you can
see what sales are going to be coming up
I see my favorite all-over setting
powder from the drugstore when I am NOT
pale I use the Physicians Formula
mineral face powder in the shade
translucent and majorly hit pan on this
both of these have gone through I don't
even know how many over the years
probably like 20 of these each this just
sets your makeup beautifully I totally
forgot how much I love this until I use
this on vacation when I was in Mexico
and it just makes your face look
airbrushed it gives you such a pretty
finish it almost looks like a super
finely milled like translucent setting
powder it gives you that airbrush kind
of look it does have coverage and if
you're pale the lightest shade won't be
light enough so I only recommend this if
you're darker than I am this is a super
recent find but I've just been in love
with it this is the maybelline superstay
better skin powder in the shade 10
porcelain now this one is a tiny bit too
dark but I can make it work especially
if I'm wearing a foundation that's a
tiny bit too light this just has such a
beautiful formula and finish it's super
soft and it really does just look like
skin it's a little bit more on the matte
side I usually like my setting powders
to be a little bit illuminating so this
one is definitely more on the matte side
but if I want something that's just
going to fully set my face and like make
my makeup not budge all day I'll reach
for this this is awesome I didn't want
to go to ham on
NIC's and elf products just because I
feel like those weren't drugstore
products until a couple years ago
probably more than that now I don't know
they just feel different than like
Maybelline and Revlon and og drugstore
brands to me but I did their own a few
things because you can now get elf at
bar tells you can get help at Target NYX
you can get out all typewritten spans at
any drugstore Target Walmart now so I
did throw in a couple of those brands my
favorite overall matte shadows from the
drugstore is the elf mad for matte
eyeshadow palette this thing is awesome
I first tried this out in my ELF one
brand tutorial a few months ago and I've
just been reaching for this a ton wish
they had a better black if they had a
super black like makeup geek erupt black
in here this would be the perfect
palette they have some really nice warm
shades and just shades that you could
use with literally any look my favorite
not matte eyeshadows are the L'Oreal
infallible Pro eyes shadow these are
like single shadows these are pretty
pricey I feel like for the drugstore so
make sure you get these on sale I
actually have the shade gilded envy on
my lids right now which is this super
pretty greenish kind of I don't even
know what you call this I think I have
like five different shades of these
literally any of them are beautiful if
you like these apply it best with your
finger but you can also use a brush and
just spray it with some settings by your
water and then apply it to your lid and
that's how you get the like crazy
pigment do the same thing with this
eyeshadow this is the elf mineral eye
shadows these are loose these have been
around for years
these are awesome and so underrated
these wet are insanely pigmented
I love these I've use these in a few
different videos this is the shade
elegant this is definitely one of my
favorites it's like this light champagne
color these are a few dollars and
they're just insane I'm just going to
power through these three products
because you guys have heard me talk
about these five billion times probably
these two more than this mascara
favorite eyeliner hands-down Physicians
Formula I booster in ultra black this
thing is awesome if you're a beginner
I'm making winged liner or you just have
to do it super quick and like run out
the door get this eyeliner you won't be
disappointed
when wild make a length mascara this is
my favorite 4 bottom lash mask
it has a super tiny one so you can just
get in your bottom lashes really easily
I've been using this for ever since I've
been on YouTube and before doesn't
transfer down to my concealer at all
it's waterproof great favorite drugstore
mascara is between Maybelline lash
sensational and Maybelline falsies I
love Maybelline mascaras I don't have my
plain falsies mascara right now which is
why I'm showing you guys this one but
both of these are great options
I like mascaras that are typically
curling I feel like both of these are
really all about the way that you apply
them they have a curved brush so when I
wear these I like really work these into
my lashes and apply a couple coats years
ago when there is no such thing as
lightening products and foundation
mixers and white foundations this saved
my life this is the NYX HD photogenic
concealer in the shade lavender I always
get asked what my favorite drugstore
concealer is and I haven't found one
that is like all-in-one for me besides a
collection cosmetics but you can't get
that one in the u.s. at the drugstore
but if you have pale skin and you're
struggling to find a drugstore concealer
I would say get this in the shade
lavender you can literally mix this in
with any concealer and it'll brighten it
up and it'll make it light enough for
your under eyes which is one of the most
challenging things with drugstore
concealers or if any concealers but I
feel like there are definitely more
high-end concealers that are pale if
you're not pale I love the Maybelline
instant age rewind concealer sometimes
I'll use this and put a little bit of
this on top and then just blend it out
under my eye and it's light enough this
is just beautiful you can't go wrong
with this concealer the only thing I
hate about this is the applicator it
drives me insane this little sponge
thing all right highlighters Physicians
Formula shimmer brick strips can never
remember the name of this in natural
nude warm nude and natural nude are
beautiful lately I've been feeling
natural nude it's just a little bit
lighter you can use these for so many
different things if you don't have this
in your life seriously go buy it I would
bet my first child that you would not be
disappointed with this product you can
use this for like 5 billion different
things you can use it to highlight your
cheekbones with light shades right here
you can use it as a blush and just kind
of swirl the pink shades you can use as
a
bronzor reduces eyeshadow if you have a
deeper skin tone just going with the
deeper golden shades as a highlight if
you have pale skin these two shades
right here as a highlight are insanely
beautiful thing i love about this
product is that it just has such an
insane Sheen to it it doesn't look
glittery it doesn't look like shimmery
eyeshadows on your cheek this is like
when I think of a true highlighter and
how it should look it's this product
more recent find which has quickly
become like Holy Grail status for me is
the essence eyes shadow in the shade
zero one snowflake you have a little bit
darker skin tone go with zero a tap
ricotta or Graeme does glammy
Graeme Goswami but I love the shade
snowflake this is so freakin beautiful
this is actually an eyeshadow you can
get essence at Ulta or Fred Meyer by the
way and it's $1 or $2
I should probably figure that out but
now it is so soft it's so buttery it
blends on your cheeks beautifully it
stays on all day contour and bronzer are
one of the things that I haven't found a
Holy Grail drugstore contour and bronzer
yet blushes this was piece of cake
covergirl trublend blush in the shade
medium rose 200 this is so freaking
pretty swatching this and like when you
put your finger on it it doesn't do it
justice it just gives you such a pretty
pinky rose glow it does have a little
bit of shimmer to it so if you're
someone that likes a totally matte blush
this one probably isn't for you but I've
just been using this a ton since it came
out this year both these blushes I
actually got this year but I've been
using them every single day I don't
think I've reached for a different blush
in a long-ass time this one right here
is the wet and wild color icon hombre
blush and the shade in a purple haze so
pretty if you like more purpley pink
blushes on fair skin this looks
beautiful if you just want the pink
shade you can go and with the top if you
want to both you can swirl it if you're
feeling a totally purple cheek you do
you when wild blushes are awesome
especially the new formula they've
recently reformulated and repackage
their blushes and they're like 50 times
better now loved one wild blushes when I
think of drugstore lipstick my favorite
the first thing that comes to mind is
Milani matte naked I've gotten so many
compliments on this shade I used to wear
this to work like every single day it's
one of those nude shades that looks like
you're wearing lipstick but it's just
slightly darker than my lips so it
doesn't look too much for work doesn't
look too much for like everyday wear and
it's freaking stays on these aren't
marketed as like long lasting lipsticks
but they definitely are I love the
formula of these not too stiff not too
creamy I think my holy grail drugstore
lip liners are by essence the formula of
these are great and they're one or two
dollars 11 in the nude is one of my
favorite shades I also like her other
nude one maybe it's 17 very something
I'll put it down below but pretty much
all their lip liners rock you just can't
go wrong with these you can wear these
by themselves or just put a little bit
of lip gloss or lipstick overtop I
wasn't going to mention this until I saw
la girl in bartels which is a drugstore
here in Washington so I'm pretty sure
you can find this at some drug store or
online for sure but this is the LA girl
glide gel liner I've used this in a ton
of videos this is probably my favorite
black eyeliner for the waterline and
just pencil liner glides on super easily
it stays on the waterline doesn't burn
my eyes and it's literally two dollars
eyebrow products this is the Ardell brow
pomade these things freakin rock if you
haven't wanted to spend money on
anastasia beverly hills dipbrow these
are a great alternative they're actually
a little bit creamier I'm wearing the
shade medium brown right now I do have
permanent brows so on an everyday basis
now I don't typically put anything on my
brows but if I have like a full face of
makeup on and I look and stuff sometimes
I like to add a little bit more shape
when I had my black hair the shade I
wore was dark brown and I've dug a
pretty good hole in this one they stay
on all day they don't budge they don't
smudge and these are like eight or nine
bucks so I have to favorite drugstore
primers one of them I couldn't find but
it's the Loreal Pro I'm going to insert
a picture right here because I can't
remember the name of it this one is
awesome at giving you a glow and making
your makeup actually stay on longer I
repurchase this probably like ten times
I don't know why
have it right now probably because I
have like 40 primers I'm trying to go
through first before I repurchase stuff
but another favorite primer is the
Maybelline master prime blur and
illuminate this one is beautiful at
giving your face is super a healthy glow
it's not going to make your foundation
look super dewy but it just gives you
kind of this like radiance to your skin
I don't think this one necessarily makes
my makeup stay on longer it just makes
my skin look kind of healthier my
favorite setting sprays not even just
from the drugstore of all time our two
drugstore products the L'Oreal
infallible Pro makeup extender setting
spray I like this one because one the
applicator doesn't squirt you like a
freaking fire hose that's a really nice
spray tip or just kind of miss your face
I do feel like this helps extend the
longevity of my makeup
it doesn't have an obnoxious smell
another favorite setting spray is hard
candy fast and fabulous you can get this
at Walmart and I'm pretty sure this one
is cheaper than the L'Oreal one this one
I feel like does almost a better job at
actually making my makeup stay longer I
like the finish that both of these give
my foundation if like they're pretty
similar the hard candy one might be a
tiny bit more dewy when I go through my
500 setting sprays that I have in my
drawer I will definitely be repurchasing
this one first I think that everything
feel like it did that semi fast maybe so
that's everything I hope I'm not majorly
forgetting something that I use like
everyday love you guys thanks for
watching see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
