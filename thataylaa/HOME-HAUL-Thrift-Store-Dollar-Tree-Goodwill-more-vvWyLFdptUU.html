is now 2:13 in the afternoon I sat down
at like 10:30 to film the first time
that didn't happen literally all I've
done today is go to Rite Aid and eat a
vegan scone that was surprisingly good
anyways I don't know why I'm talking
about a vegan scone since I've been
decorating my room in the new apartment
I've been getting a lot of questions
about all this DIY stuff I've been doing
and posting on Instagram so I thought
that since you guys were interested in
that that I would flip all of my thrift
store finds in my mind the thrift store
is the second best place to target you
can find really good cheap stuff at the
thrift store and sometimes it just takes
a little bit of spray paint or paint and
fixing it up and it looks like something
that you got out of Pottery Barn which
is basically what I did with my whole
room I will be having a room tour coming
soon when everything is completely kaput
and I'm also working on the lighting and
everything right now I don't know let me
know if you like the lighting I feel
like it washes me out that's the only
thing I think it's good lighting is
natural lighting but I feel very not in
my right color I'm so freaking full from
this go so anyways let's get into the
hall I guess this isn't just a thrift
store haul this is my restored Dollar
Tree craft store haul is just the home
haul it's called a home mall but I'm
gonna start off with thrift store stuff
okay so the first thing I went to
Goodwill on a like Tuesday night it was
9 p.m. in the place was freaking packed
I don't know what was going on there
wasn't it like a giant sale or anything
they have sales every day but it was
insane I had my little shopping cart I
was pushing my shopping cart left at the
end of the aisle and I come back and
someone is going through my shopping
cart what the is this who does that
people of goodwill aren't saying but
anyways onto the things I got first
thing I got is this shell first of all I
actually really like the color how it is
but my room is like a black and white
theme and all my furniture is white so
I'm going to be painting these shelves
that I got and I have this whole empty
over here that I'm trying to figure out
what I want to do it but I know I want
to like layered shelves so I got this
shelf and this was like $2.99 I think I
took off the tag I think is $2.99 so I'm
just gonna paint this white and it has
nice brackets to hang it with already so
I didn't have to get anything from Home
Depot for that one and then the second
one I got is this shelf and it has a
heart on it which I thought was really
cute and it goes with my like vintage
theme we have going on so I'm painting
this one white as well and these are
going to be like oh my god this is
really heavy these are going to be
layered if you know what I mean then at
the thrift store I found this and at
first I was like I don't know if I want
to get this because it is it was $4.99
which is really expensive for Goodwill
but it goes with my room so well it is
this glass candle holder and I thought
it would look really good on the painted
white shelf with like a black candle in
it I thought about it I was like okay
well this would be like 10 or 15 bucks
at Target so why not
alright so then I found another candle
holder and I used to never understand
the point of actually like lighting
candles I've been on this like candle
binge right now I'm just loving it I
never understood candles and now I'm
like a candle advocate I got this candle
holder at Goodwill as well and this was
$0.99 and then the blue tags were
actually half off so I got this for
$0.50 this is from Target originally it
looks like brand-new oh no not from
Target it's from Bath and Body Works
just thought this is really cute and it
goes with my other ones I have right now
so then I also got two pillows at
Goodwill and they are in like perfect
condition I will be showing you an image
of them right now
but then each for $1.99 and they're like
brand-new but yeah I'm also like
furnishing our living room basically
really into this whole interior design
thing right now I don't know what it is
but I'm having a lot of fun and I'm
doing it for cheap so that was
everything I've got a goodwill I've
gotten a ton of other stuff at the
thrift store as the past few days but
you guys will see it in my room tour
next I went to Dollar Tree and I just
needed a couple of random things but
then I found these and these are the
luminescence candles in
sugar cookie and they smell just like a
freaking sugar cookies I just got four
words for the bath and body one because
it will fit perfectly in there and then
I saw this and I just loved the outside
of this it is a sugar cookie candle but
it is actually in a mason jar I just
thought that that was adorable - look
how freaking cute this is like I feel
like this would be something that you
find on Pinterest so those are about the
dollar obviously from Dollar Tree and
then the last thing I got from Dollar
Tree weren't just oh and here's a tailor
here to tailor hairs last thing I got
from Dollar Tree is just these white
little fake flower roses I'm all about
the fake flowers to have them all over
so the next thing I have is also fake
flowers I got these actually at Joan's
fabric store I think is we're in the
Halloween section which I thought was
kind of cool because I was looking for
black roses and this is the perfect time
to find them apparently because it's
Halloween either really cute they just
have glitter on the front I thought
these would be really cute to put on one
of the shelves just a little base or
something these were each let's see
these were 399 each however there were
40% off so I got him for like 230
something I don't know do the math that
was just a little quick mini haul for
you guys I only follow my Instagram if
you want to see things as I'm purchasing
them and creating them - all that good
stuff I just love the thrift store if
you have a thrift store haul leave
applause a video response because I love
watching them thanks for watching I'll
see you guys in my next video thumbs up
