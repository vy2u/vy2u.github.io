Friday it's the weekend
hello yeah a lot has happened in regards
to apartment things and moving in and
unpacking I would say I'm like 70% done
now I stopped to do a lot of unpacking
and a lot of decorating but I have like
the bulk French Eric kinds of things in
my arm
it's so sore I seriously don't know how
bloggers do this so tomorrow is vlogger
fair I'm super excited I hope I meet
some of you that would be pretty cool
feel like I have a ton of stuff to
do before tomorrow I have no idea what
I'm wearing for vlogger fair after paint
the nails probably pluck the brows who
knows so I'm obviously gonna be vlogging
tomorrow blogger fair and I'm gonna try
and blog tonight and then just put it
into like one one kind of thing you guys
seem to really like the last vlog so I
don't know I feel like vlogs are either
really entertaining or really boring and
I'm not sure which one I am so I'm just
gonna show you bits and pieces since I'm
gonna do a room tour when it's all put
together so if you saw my last vlog you
saw kind of the layout of this room it's
a living room so there's obviously no
closet or anything so I got this white
rack from Ikea it's just like a metal
whatever this is rack and then I got
these velvet hangers from TJ Maxx and I
just have all my clothes hanging on here
somewhat color-coded who knows I
realized that I have way too many black
clothes that desk is really messy
something I've been showing you guys
here's my nightstand that I put together
from Ikea Shay is not easy I don't know
why people say IKEA furniture is easy
she I think it's more time than swimming
than that anything over here I just have
my keys watch this man Kendall is
literally the best smelling thing in the
world it's black tie by Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works I think that one was limited
edition
I'm not sure mahogany teak wood is also
my other favorite this is also from Ikea
I just like it I feel like I have so
much to do right now that I don't
even know where to start so I think I'm
just gonna take out all of this recycle
done I think I'm gonna get some kind of
wall unit right here maybe like a tiny
bookshelf or something oh no how would
you guys fill up this awkward length
wall I
packed for literally two minutes and
then I lost motivations and I'm just
showing on my bed listening to you I'm
gonna make some fish for dinner because
I figured I should probably get
something other than ramen I know fish
is like the easiest thing ever to bake
on your own but this comes like argue
crusted and it's bomb I just unpacked my
mirror and it is completely completely
cracked I don't know if you guys can see
that but the mirrors cracked and then
right here is all cracked that's awesome
I've unpacked all the perfumes and have
them set up this unit which was just in
my other and this one also broke during
moving right here this is a mirror that
I got off of Amazon that I'm obsessed
with the hesays like giant ass number
it's pretty modern this is why I think
I'm kind of kind of confused right now
because I have like half modern half I
don't know my old style like this kind
of style would even call that like
contemporary I don't know traditional I
just kind of need to decide like which
one I'm going for I have the rug down I
love the rug right here I think is
perfect and also Rach walks out right
here so it'll probably be you know help
the noise a little bit I'm gonna be
getting a new mirror for right there all
above here is gonna have wall art and
stuff I've got spinach going fish is
almost done I don't know why the red
part of the oven isn't on this weird
this cooking you probably need to mix
that I want to see if I can boil a
hard-boiled egg in like a cup of water
in the microwave I don't know why that
idea just popped in my head but we're
gonna try it
alright calm down this is my favorite
way to eat spinach if you just saute it
with a little bit of olive oil and then
add some garlic salt it doesn't even
taste like spinach I just filled this up
with water let's see if this works
alright let's do this
30 seconds baby no no see
so that was an epic failure and it
literally just exploded everywhere over
the microwave awesome
don't try this at home kids got my fish
and spinach some wine and the classy
coca-cola Cup from Dollar Tree I'm
obsessed with these by the way actually
pretty good for drinking wine because
the rim is really thin but I also just
can't find our wine glasses put a petite
I think I just hit a wall</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
