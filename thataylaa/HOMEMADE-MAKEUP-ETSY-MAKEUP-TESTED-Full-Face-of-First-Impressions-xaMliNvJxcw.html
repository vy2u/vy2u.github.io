free candy you know the way to my heart
all right so today I'm gonna be doing a
full-face testing out all makeup from
Etsy I'm so freaking excited if you're
never heard of Etsy is basically like an
online marketplace for different sellers
there's people from all over the world
on there I love buying jewelry on Etsy
they just have a lot of unique handmade
things I just think Etsy is a really
cool way to support people's passions
whether it's makeup wood carving baby
clothes like whatever it may be I just
think it's cool
to help support people doing what they
love so I've been wanting to make this
video for a while I just didn't really
know where to start
I don't think I've ever purchased makeup
on Etsy if I did it was like years ago
one of you guys Kayla and a youtube
comment suggested that I'd do this kind
of just sparked it again and I tweeted
and a bunch of you guys said that you
wanted to see this video got me hyped up
so here we are Before we jump into
testing out the products I wanted to say
a little bit just about the experience
by makeup on Etsy and some things that I
think might be helpful if you guys are
gonna be purchasing anything or just
looking into shopping on Etsy for makeup
so I spent a few hours hardcore going
through Etsy trying to find the best
sellers that had good reviews I looked
at their Instagram basically just tried
to find people that looked like they had
interesting products good customer
service and that people had good things
to say about one tip I have before you
check out check their instagrams or just
do a Google search for any coupons that
that shop might have going on do I say
coupons or coupons end up saving 16
dollars to different coupons dropping on
Etsy makeup specifically there's
actually a lot of really great deals on
things some things can get pricey with
the shipping I found that was kind of
where I was spending most of my money
was actually on shipping total I spent a
hundred sixty six dollars in all these
products but 40 of those dollars were
for shipping I purchased all these
products myself and none of these
sellers know I'm making a video or
anything I did want to say I was kind of
worried about making this video just
because I recognize that these are small
businesses there's so much love that
goes into making products when you're
running it out of your own home a lot of
times it's just one person running the
show doing everything and I totally
respect that and I don't want to knock
down any particular seller that's not
the goal here I'm just trying to give my
honest thoughts on products and share my
experiences with them like I always say
products work differently for different
people something I love you might hate
and vice versa same goes for Etsy
sellers if I don't like a product it
doesn't mean that it's a horrible
product it just didn't work out for me
so like always and be honest with
that's how products work out for me just
felt like I needed to say that if you're
a seller I respect the hustle you go
girl or guy sellers that had cute
packaging I did keep because I feel like
that's one of the exciting parts of
shopping on Etsy is the packaging a lot
of sellers put a lot of time and effort
and money into their packaging which
would have just been money back in their
pocket so I definitely appreciate that
and I wanted to shout those people out
if you guys are excited for this video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up it
helps me out if you want to see how I
got this look and what I think about
Etsy make up you're in the right place
just keep watching I'm so excited to try
this stuff out I actually just got my
lash extensions put back on have a whole
video talking about my thoughts on them
and everything I've already washed
moisturized and primed of my face I
actually ordered this really interesting
powder primer on there that you're
supposed to put on before your
foundation but something happened and
the seller hasn't actually shipped it
yet so we're just gonna move on into the
foundation so I prefer a full coverage
foundation I want all the acne covered
so I got a couple of different sample
foundations to try out since I didn't
know which one was gonna be a better
shade and coverage the whole thing about
buying makeup on Etsy is a lot of the
sellers offer sample sizes so you can
get a little sample cups or bags some of
the sellers were charging between like
four and seven dollars to ship samples
it's a good way to try stuff out before
committing to the full size I'm gonna
have every single thing I'm talking
about listed down below with the seller
and everything the first foundation is
the superior performance liquid
foundation by CL cosmetics and I also
picked up another foundation sample and
a couple other things from pura nada
they gave me this little brochure in
here that one is handcrafted in Canada
vegan and cruelty free organic
ingredients I got all the lighter shades
the foundation this one is in the shade
alabaster and this is in Stockholm
alabaster one looks like it's about
three shades lighter than this
foundation so I'm thinking I'm gonna go
in with this I also got this which I'm
really excited to try this is a white
powder foundation mixer doesn't say to
not use this with liquid so I'm assuming
you could mix it in with liquid or
powder foundation to lighten it I also
did get a setting powder so I think I'm
going to mix that in with the setting
powder probably or use that underneath
my eyes but she also has a darkening
powder alright so I'm on the Etsy
sellers page we're gonna read some of
the claims about this foundation says
it's a moisturizing full coverage
formula non greasy texture but it does
have coconut oil in it which I didn't
know
not the best for acne kind of just
looking for the foundation with the most
coverage okay I'm so curious about the
coverage on this Oh shade looks nice I'm
just blending this out with my Sigma f80
the shade is nice I'm glad the shade is
light enough shade actually matches me
pretty well but this definitely isn't
full coverage it actually looks like
pretty light coverage you can see all of
my acne freckles everything coming
through yeah this is very light coverage
I'm kind of curious about the coverage
of this foundation is gonna be way too
dark so I might just add a tiny bit down
here just we can see how it does yeah
mm-hmm okay I think I'm gonna go back in
with that first foundation and let's
just try and build this up I also have a
concealer I'm gonna try out so I can
always spot conceal a little bit at
least this shade on this one is closer
if you like light coverage it is sitting
on this skin nicely kinda looks like a
tinted moisturizer it doesn't feel
greasy or anything like it feels like
it's setting down I'm just gonna dip my
brush in here ooh
okay don't build this that was the wrong
decision gets a little bit separated
almost it looks nice on my skin for
light coverage I just wouldn't probably
market this as full coverage okay so I'm
definitely gonna go in with this spot
concealer hopefully this has a little
bit more coverage so this is by the
brand born cosmetics it says silky shea
butter clean concealer I have the
lightest shade fair light this was 1095
says it glides on silky smooth has long
lasting performance it says our
concealer foundation is great for
sensitive skin and sensitive eyes so I
guess you could use this as kind of a
foundation as well all right give me
some coverage concealer so the plan is
the spot conceal with this and then also
use this underneath my eyes I have a lot
of acne down here right now so we'll see
how scuppers I'm gonna try using this
almost like a foundation so I'm not
getting that much coverage with this at
all it's actually like not covering yeah
it doesn't really look like anything's
happening I'm gonna use my Sigma f80 too
and try and just go in with this
okay I think I like a better as
foundation it's giving a pretty like
luminous glow still not covering a whole
lot but building it up on top of the
other foundation I think is helping but
on my actual acne spots it's not really
covering I did get a powder foundation
that I'm gonna use to set my makeup so
hopefully that will add a little bit
more coverage to I actually don't think
it really covers as a concealer I think
it more just evens out your complexion a
bit I need to be careful with this stuff
since there's so much oil in it with the
eyelash extensions I don't know if it's
really showing up on the viewfinder but
you can still see a lot of my acne
especially on my forehead let's try this
underneath the eyes it does feel very
moisturizing but the loose powder
foundation I got is the gourmet rose
mineral foundation in the shade number
zero faranoush roll I got the full size
of this I think she included these
little samples for free so that was
really cool she included the translucent
veil and then also a different shade of
the foundation I think the next shade up
the full size of this retails for 1495
says a very water-resistant complete
flawless coverage for skin conditions
like acne rosacea and redness so that
gives me some hope but that's claimed to
give flawless coverage for acne I think
first I'm going to set my face and then
probably mix it with that white powder
to use underneath my eyes the packaging
is nice it comes with a little shifter
thing that you twist to get the product
out Jade looks a bit dark but we'll see
I'm gonna use my normal powder brush
with this the for less cb4 and I have a
bunch of powder in the lid oh definitely
too dark let's give him a pretty good
coverage
that looks nice my skin looks really
smooth right now it doesn't look like I
have like a powder on even though this
is too dark I'll just blend it down my
neck
personally I get the best coverage when
I pat on my powder I never really blend
because it just blends away the product
underneath this is giving me a really
great coverage I'm just like full-on
bringing this down the neck
it is clinging like a little bit weird
but I think that's probably just the
liquid foundations I have on underneath
it does blend out you just kind of have
to work with it
it gives a little bit of like a luminous
glow that could just be the other
foundations with the oils can't really
tell when I just watch the powder on my
hand I'm going to take this smaller
brush and see if I can kind of use this
just on my spots to add a little bit
more coverage it's going on a bit darker
right there for some reason it is adding
some coverage I'm happy with the powder
I wish it came in a couple shades
lighter because this is too dark so
let's go with this white powder this is
a three gram sample jar and it was - 89
think I'm actually just gonna add a
little bit more of this in the cap and
then just go ahead and add in some of
that white powder and mix it in the cap
here's my little concoction I'm gonna
mix this with this brush the white looks
like straight-up powder sugar like it
has a similar kind of balls to it - that
definitely lightened it cool crazy how
when you mix white with things it
lightens it whoa whoa inhaling that the
white isn't super finely milled there's
some like balls of it so I feel like as
you blend it out kind of more white
keeps getting blended on if that makes
any sense like the ball will start
breaking down that's definitely too
light since my face is this dark right
now but I'm gonna go ahead and do the
other side and then we'll go in and fix
it we're gonna go on to my normal brush
and attempt to fix this just to make my
under eyes not look so crazy right now
I'm gonna take that same concoction for
underneath the eyes and just add some to
the center of my face the center of my
forehead looks really good which is like
my problem area I get a lot of texture
there but I think this is as good as
we're gonna get and trying to work with
it for like five minutes
clearly the white Lightner works I wish
it was a little bit more finely milled
there are some like bigger chunks in
there which if you're mixing you just
need to be sure to kind of crush them so
you're not getting too much white in
there and then actually just get a
second shifter and do my own mix of
these two for face powder for an eye
primer I don't really want to put that
concealer on my eyes because of all the
oils so I'm just gonna use my normal Mac
painterly Paint Pot alright moving on to
the brows eyebrow products and concealer
were the two things that were really
tricky to find people who are selling
those kind
at the market corner there's not a whole
lot of options so perhaps to them the
sellers that had cute packaging that
kind of stood out I kept to show you
guys because I think that's something
that's a really nice touch it's all
coming out of their profit essentially
so I just think it's a really nice touch
when people invest in that kind of thing
so this eyebrow product came in the
cutest packaging whoa it's like little
polka dot tissue paper and then it's in
this cute freakin box look at this she
also included a free eyeshadow sample so
that's really cool with this little card
she has directions for the eyebrow
product so that's awesome so let's take
out the box oh my god so cute
so her brand is breathtaking beauty and
this is the mineral eye brow tint it's
essentially like dip brow or another
brow pomade except it says it also has
and oils in it Etsy sellers love their
oils to encourage hair growth and health
it says the formulas long-lasting and
waterproof so I'm excited let's try this
out there's the inside nicely pressed in
there just coming through my brows with
a spoolie first dang this powder looks
good it feels like the perfect
consistency so far it's not too creamy
wear it like makes a dent in there yeah
that worked well it's not too waxy but
also not too creamy so you're still kind
of in control of it want to say it's
quite as pigmented as the dip brow which
could be a good thing because it's
pretty easy in my opinion to go a little
bit overboard with the dip brow that
looks really nice I would use that again
a plus packaging good product so for
contour this looks very promising the
shade of this this is the same brand the
pure nada this is the foundation I tried
this is the medium matte contouring
powder so she makes two different shades
in this the shade is actually called
alluring this is the lightest one and it
says for pale to light skin tones or for
a very natural contour some of the
reviews that a little bit goes a long
way so I just have a tiny bit amount
tiny bit amount I'm gonna use my flower
Beauty brush which I've been obsessed
with I have a very small amount on here
whew oh hell yeah whoo I feel like this
is a perfect tone blending out nicely
okay super excited about this I'm buying
the full size I had a little bit of this
on my temple since I still have a lot
left over on the palette you literally
need the smallest amount of this if you
bought the full size jar which i think
is 3 grams that would last you for
forever
that's pretty this is like what benefit
hoola light should have been oh I might
have blush we've got another winner
without one folks I'm super excited
about this contour powder I'm gonna be
ordering the full-size the highlighter I
got I could not decide which highlighted
to get there were so many pretty ones on
Etsy if I ended up coming with one from
Beauty bar baby it came in this hot pink
packaging which I appreciate
oh also RTA thiis but i didn't want to
forget to mention them so I put the
wrapper back in crucial part of the
seller she put in free candy you know
the way to my heart I also got a liquid
lipstick from her look at the packaging
so here's the packaging of the
highlighter comes this little pouch and
it looks like it's a magnetic pan I have
a magnetic palette here just by Ofra
that I'm gonna stick this into because
the eyeshadows they got are also
magnetic you can use a Z palette with
these or whatever so it has a beautiful
design on here it almost looks like the
Burberry highlight she has a few
different shades of these I got the one
pretty and champagne and this retails
for $7.99 which I feel like it's a
really good deal oh yeah super pretty
that is beautiful it's not emphasizing
my texture or anything gives a super
pretty sheen feel like I'm gonna need
more shades of these dude that's pretty
total use this as an eyeshadow too
 my instacart is coming right now I
think we're gonna take a momentary pause
alright have groceries PA for food so I
actually did get a blush so all the
eyeshadows I got and the blush is from
Feather River body at the blush in the
shade pink earth and it looks like this
really nice light baby pink kind of
color ooh that looks pretty blush was
nine dollars alright see oh that was
powdery very powdery
I don't know yeah you can see that the
kickback right there
tap off the brush powder is like flying
up pretty shade though I just dipped my
brush into the hiccup because there's
still at a product by the way when I was
waiting for the instacart I was looking
at my face out and I'm air by natural
lighting and the highlight looks frickin
amazeballs it's beautiful like I said
all the eyeshadows I got were from her I
got six shades I'm gonna pop them into
the palette so I can
you guys can see him all his over pet
looks monkey okay so here are the six
shades that I end up getting I got three
matte shades and it looks like three
shimmer shades I remember she had kind
of different formulas a couple of them
are pressed pigments super intense it
says so the pressed pigments were six
dollars and then the matte eyeshadows
were five dollars I think eyeshadows are
one of the things that I shopped around
for at the longest just because there
are so many options and a lot of them
actually don't show swatches I found
myself gravitating overall towards
sellers who showed swatches because then
you can see what the product actually
looks like definitely found myself
buying more from sellers I had swatches
I also would go to their Instagram pages
a lot of times to see if they had actual
photos of people wearing them and I have
the exact shades and shade names listed
down below I think I got this one to
also use as like a face highlight oh
heck yeah that just watched beautifully
let's try this this is like a gold green
kind of color there's that one I really
want to use that pink shade but I feel
like I've done a lot of pink looks
lately so for the crease since I have
some left over I'm gonna use the same
bronzer contour shade I used and it's
working great as an eyeshadow too I'm
gonna start out by going in with this
camel color which is called Ally and
these shadows seem to be getting really
good reviews by people a lot of people
were saying they were comparable if not
better to makeup geek so I'm curious I
think I'm gonna going with this red
brick kind of shade this is sunset these
eye shadows so far I have a little bit
of kick up but they're not anything like
the blush it almost looks more like a
coral when it's actually on your eyes
that's super pretty
these are blending out really easily and
I'm not getting like any fallout right
now and I'm gonna take the shade mermaid
I'm gonna use my finger to first put it
on since that's typically how I do lid
shades and then I'll blend it out with a
brush probably that's pretty actually
with these lash extensions I kind of
need to use a brush I can't get close
enough I'm gonna wet my brush to see if
I can get a little bit more pop with
this not like totally mind blown but it
is it's pretty I'm gonna go in that
deeper brown shade it's called cafe
looks kind of like Mack Brown script I
can't find my new favorite BH brush has
a freaking neon pink handle so you think
I wouldn't be able to lose it
ooh that's pretty
you like I have to move in like slow
motion with lash extensions when I do
eyeshadow I don't know this mermaid
shade I'm just not getting the kind of
pop I want from it I'm gonna try to use
my finger what that's better
I think finger is the way to go with
that one into those shadows I would
purchase more of those especially I
think the matte shades maybe I'll
actually use that pink on the lower lash
line first I'm gonna go back into that
camel shade and blend it on the lower
lash line like these were frickin
pigmented I think it might work that
pink shade I'm just right on the center
oh that's pretty it's almost like a
deeper rose gold shade that's beautiful
I almost feel like you could even use
that to top off like a lipstick I don't
think this white shade would quite go
with the look I'm going for for the
inner corner so I think I'm just gonna
take the same highlight shade that I
used on my face I'm just gonna put on my
bottom mascara I didn't really think
through the whole eyes lips thing I did
get a few different lip options again
this is by beauty bar baby liquid
lipstick this is the same brand that did
the highlighter cool packaging this will
definitely go with this look this one's
in the shade nude suede shoes and it's
$13.99 this packaging it might be tied
with the eyebrow packaging by breaking
Beauty there are so many cute things
about this one I love that she wrote a
little handwritten thing on here
but this was the coolest part I almost
threw this way I didn't even see it
look at that she hand drew up stick on
there that's just awesome that she took
the time to do that
so this is by the brand Jenny retro oh
my god this is so cute she included like
a mirror this is awesome
great job Jenny on the outside of here I
think it actually said to use a lip
primer and I think she just included it
and then I got this shade this could
also work if I want to do like a really
deep reddish brown it looks very liquidy
that's interesting thinking this is an
actual like liquid kind of tint thing
that dries down Matt because this is
very
very liquidy and then the last lipstick
I got it came in this purple packaging
super cute box on this one I love that
by Lolita cosmetics did I just say that
I think so
this is the laconic liquid lipstick in
the shade damned reciting it's like a
bright red kind of shade I just got this
to try out because I've been really into
these kind of shades lately and this
lipstick was 1199 so I think for this
look I want to try out the beauty bar
baby
I think this cool toned purple will look
really good with that green okay so it
doesn't really have a smell it smells a
little bit chemically ooh pretty color
it looks a lot more nude than I was
expecting which I'm pleasantly surprised
about feels very very thin it's not like
a creamy or moosie consistency is
applicator kind of tickles see how long
it takes to kind of totally dry down oh
the bottom is dry alright so took about
a minute to dry down and it feels nice I
wouldn't say it feels overly drying it's
definitely not like a moisturizing
liquid lipstick but I don't feel like my
lips are gonna fall off they're so dry
right so that's everything that I got to
try out from Etsy I'm gonna do a quick
rundown so you guys can see the things
that were passes for me and then things
I recommend off the bat I think the
thing that stands out most to me is the
highlighter it's beautiful definitely
gonna be picking out more shades of this
because just the way that it sits on
your skin and the sheen that it gives is
stunning the eyeshadows I also really
like especially the matte shades and
then the other kind of two standout
products to me are the gourmet rose
mineral foundation this pleasantly
surprised me and I think I will be
mixing in this Lightner with it Lightner
I think it's a great concept I think I
need to play around that a little bit
more maybe I just didn't mix it totally
right for underneath the eyes this gives
you pretty good coverage and just the
finish of it is beautiful I wish you
made a few more shades in this both
deeper and lighter and then this contour
powder man love this gotta be ordering
the full size of this I also would use
the eye brow pomade again those are the
thumbs up stand out products to me I
think my least favorite thing I tried is
probably the concealer just because it
didn't really cover anything think it
evens out overall complexion redness but
I wouldn't really call this a concealer
it's creamy but very light coverage
again just because I don't like
something doesn't mean it's a horrible
product I'm sure there's a lot of people
who have bought from these sellers and
have tried these products that
absolutely love them and it works for
them that's the great thing about makeup
and just off for first impressions
that's kind of what I feel
this foundation my only thing with this
is that I would not market this as full
coverage it looks beautiful as a light
coverage foundation like the way that it
sat on my skin was really nice this is
just in no way full coverage overall I
feel like I'm pretty pleasantly
surprised with some of the stuff I found
and it makes me want to pick up other
makeup and keep trying things out so
