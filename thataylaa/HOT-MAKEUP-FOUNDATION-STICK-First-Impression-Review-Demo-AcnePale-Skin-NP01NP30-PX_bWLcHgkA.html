cup Dollar Tree gotta love it
all right so today it is foundation
Friday happy foundation Friday if you
are new here this is where we do a new
first impression video every single
Friday on my channel 15 days of
foundation is coming up November 5th to
the 20th 15 days in a row of foundation
videos I'm getting ready I'm actually
going to start pre recording for that
soon like this week and you do but today
we were trying out a product that I
haven't heard a lot about haven't heard
a lot about the brand this is the hot
makeup natural perfection foundation
stick months ago they posted this
picture on Instagram I think dupe that
actually posted it and it was foundation
swatches and we show the picture right
here but it basically showed super pale
shades and a bunch of you guys tagged me
saying you wanted to see if they're
actually pale so I ended up getting two
shades I have the shade np0 1 and n P 30
it comes in 10 shades if you're pale
princess the lightest shade is actually
MP 30 which is a little bit confusing
but even on their color chart online MP
30 and NP 55 actually look lighter than
MP 0 1 and insert some swatches of these
two shades also next to some of the
other stick foundations that I own so
you can see this watches all right
swatch time so right here is the hot
makeup stick in NP 0 1 this is in the
shade NP 30 obviously way lighter and
this one is pretty pink toned right here
we have the Anastasia Beverly Hills
stick foundation in porcelain
this is the hourglass vanish stick
foundation in the shade Blanc elf stick
foundation in the lightest shade and
this is the golden rose stick foundation
in 0/1 all these products right here
I've either done a review on or use them
in a video so if you're curious about my
thoughts about any of them you can find
them by searching YouTube the taalib
plus the name of the foundation so this
retails for 29 bucks on hot makeup calm
I'm not sure if you can find this
anywhere in stores in the US I know you
can in other countries get 0.5 2 ounces
of product in here which is awesome this
is the largest amount of product I've
ever seen in a stick foundation at least
out of the ones that I own just to give
you some comparison the hourglass
foundation which I despise has 0.25
the product in here also did a review on
this Anastasia Beverly Hills stick
foundation
this has 0.32 ounces L phonation is the
closest next in line most product in the
stick foundation this has 0.49 the make
up forever stick foundation has 0.44
ounces so you definitely get a lot of
product in here for your money twenty
nine bucks for over half an ounce of
product is pretty good this brand is
cruelty free I'm going to go ahead and
read some of the claims on their website
it says this in innovative lightweight
foundation stick formulated for full
coverage effortless blending and high
pigmentation the core is infused with an
anti shine control powder that instantly
dissolves excess oil so you can feel
fresh throughout the day that is all it
says on there no parabens cruelty free
and hypoallergenic so let's jump into
the foundation if you want to see how
this foundation applies and wears
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching have to say it
again I'm on my not good camera the Sony
camera and it does blur my face face
blurs off you can see when I get really
close there it takes it off so this is
what my skin actually looks like right
now if I could not have that on I would
since it is a foundation review but I'll
try and get up close as much as possible
to show you what it's really looking
like in reality so I'm going to start
out with this hot makeup
pours away vanishing primer I'm really
feeling the rose gold packaging they
have going on I'm just gonna apply this
all over mostly focusing it in the
center of my face feels very soft I'm
going to sit on for problems and then
we'll go in to apply foundation so have
these two shades here you've already
seen the swatches and NP 30 is
definitely the lightest one it has this
little center thing kind of like the
Maybelline fit me stick is an anti shine
core so helping to control oil
throughout the day I have combination
skin I tend to get oily throughout the
day on my t-zone I'm gonna try n P 30
and if that's a little bit too light I
might mix in np0 one I'm going to be
using this elf brush I like the exact
one table this is my favorite brush to
blend out take foundations and cream
products it just works
amazing and it's a few bucks so I'm just
going to apply like a norm
I would have stick foundation has a
really strong scent it smells like super
chemically whoo so let's go in and blend
I might try a sponge on one side
possibly we'll see the product is
spreading pretty far but it's not giving
me a ton of coverage okay
this camera it looks totally different
you can see I'm trying to zoom in okay
so this is as far as I can zoom in
hopefully it doesn't do the blurring
thing I think that looks better
but you can see it's not really covering
any of this scarring right here Jade
whines it's pretty light with that
amount of product definitely not the
same kind of coverage that the makeup
perverts dig foundation has a blend out
pretty easily not as smooth as make it
forever
I would say it kind of blends out the
way the Maybelline fit me stick
foundation blends out I've done a ton of
stick foundation reviews so link those
in the playlist down below I have a
whole playlist or stick foundations off
the bat just kind of averaged to me
let's try the other side with a sponge
I'm going to try this BH Studio Pro
Beauty sponge I've already dampened it I
don't know what this is made out of but
it doesn't feel like the Beauty Blender
sponge material it's that like more
rubbery consistency let me know down
below if you know what that material is
called sponge is really hard not a fan
of this sponge pretty hard and I feel
like it's kind of just soaking up a lot
of the product we're going to ditch the
sponge and apply it tiny bit more since
I feel like that just ate it up even on
my forehead where there's nothing to
cover you can still see my freckles and
stuff coming through I'm gonna try and
build it up just down here and see if I
can get more coverage okay that
definitely gave a little bit more
coverage still not totally full I would
say we're about hi medium with two
layers kind of avoiding this area
because I don't want to put too much
product where I usually crease so here
is with about one and a half layers I
only put it on these areas I'm going to
take a look up close so I think it's
actually looking better on camera as far
as I can see in the viewfinder but when
you get up close up close texture city
let me see if I can show you this I
don't know if that's picking up at all
on the camera
ah but you can pretty much see all of my
texture my forehead does not look great
looks super patchy in here and it's kind
of like picking up on dry patches so
right now it is nagging o'clock I'm
going to apply the rest of makeup I am
going to do a setting powder today
because it feels sticky like it hasn't
set at all and it also just had that
kind of greasy feeling where I feel like
I'm definitely going to need to set this
one so I'm going to do that apply the
rest of my makeup and then I will be
right back
okay so it's now 923 we're going to call
the second time at 9 a.m. because that's
when I first applied it I'm gonna tell
you guys about what I put on top but
first before i zoom out I want to show
you I want to show you what it looks
like without the blur thing on it
doesn't look bad right now it does look
pretty heavy especially around this area
and on my forehead it doesn't look very
great you can just see texture and stuff
even with the powder and setting spray
so I'm going to zoom out and show you
what I used okay so to set my face to
use the maybelline superstay better skin
powder I've talked about this before
really like this powder has more of like
a soft matte finish contour i use the
sephora eyeshadow in tranquil and then
use a little bit of this Santi this
shade right here for like bronzer /
blush highlight a used hourglass
diffused light I recently got this and I
actually really like it it's like a
super nice subtle kind of highlight
which I wanted for this because I needed
something to make it look more like skin
eyelash inside the Kara 48 and then for
lips I used Rimmel lip liner in 0:32
innocent and then the lipstick is makeup
revolution chauffeur I think that's
everything
oh and then I set my face with the elf
makeup mist inside I don't think this
helps with the longevity of my
foundation at all but I do think it
definitely helped to kind of make my
face look more like skin unless cake
face as far as lasting power I like the
hard candy and L'Oreal setting sprays
better than this one so we are going to
wear this start the day I'm just getting
some work done and then I'm going to
this like presentation thing later I'm
not sure if I'll be finishing the check
in before then or after depends how the
foundation looks I am going to check in
in natural lighting so you guys can see
how
in the next check-in so I will see you
in a few hours all right so it is 246 in
the afternoon where's my clock think it
is so the Foundation's been almost on
for six hours
it is raining today we're supposed to
have like a typhoon or something here in
Seattle come on switch the shirt because
I was freezing took off the eyelashes my
eyes are on fire but let's do a quick
update I'm going to get really close so
hopefully it doesn't Fleur very up close
and personal right now really the only
thing that I think looks bad right now
is right here on the nose and I'm
getting some line marks right here I
feel like the rest of the face actually
looks better than when I first applied
it I think it's one of those that
actually kind of warms up to your skin
and kind of wears better throughout the
day at least so far I'm definitely
liking it better than when I first
applied it I think the shade is a
perfect match especially with the powder
that's a little bit darker have my big
mirror here that I'm looking super
up-close at and yeah I think the center
of the forehead and then around the nose
are really the only areas that I think
don't look great right now the center of
the forehead just looks quite textured
so I think I'm actually going to keep
this on until after the presentation
thing
Rach is coming over I think we're going
to grab dinner and then we're going to
this talk it's like a talk on refugee
the refugee crisis so I think I'm going
to try and keep it on and then check in
after that when I come home check in Y
is going to be a long day I'm actually
really excited about this rain right now
I have just been working I haven't eaten
anything I feel like I'm about to pass
out but I just post mates cafe hem
because I'm an addict I post mates dude
yesterday actually recognized me because
he's been here a few times now we're on
a first-name basis okay so it's now 8:24
p.m. so the Foundation's been on for 11
and a half hours pretty much and it is
oily look at how shiny I am looks pretty
horrible around my nose area I feel like
I could like dig in my nail and yeah
around the nose area just looks pretty
awful this still looks pretty good but
my forehead is extremely oily for
sending with the powder I usually don't
get this oily when I set with the powder
I definitely have foundations that hold
up a lot better for this length of time
so definitely
long-wearing personally I like the
makeup primer stick foundation better I
think it just blends out beautifully
looks like skin if you're going to spend
the money on the stick foundation I
think go with that one this one isn't
bad just not my favorite so I hope you
guys liked this video if you did make
sure you give it a thumbs up you can
always let me know down below I'm like
literally out of breath right now just
got back from the presentation and then
went to dinner with my roommate and now
we're doing this wrapping it up and then
I need to edit this you can always let
me know down below what foundations you
