the close-up shot I can't breathe or
else it moves too much
all right so today it's day 11 of 15
days of foundation 11s my lucky number
so hopefully we'll have a winner today
where did I just put the foundation yep
so as I was kind of scrolling through
Sephora this description for this
product just stood out to me because it
sounded exactly what I'm looking for
what I want in life this is the
hourglass illusion hyaluronic skin tint
so it's called a skin tint but their
description actually calls it a medium
to full coverage foundation which is
really interesting does it's a
foundation that smoothes the look of
fine lines and wrinkles and sagging skin
delivers a radiant glow for a smoother
firmer youthful looking complexion
so it sounds by that description that
they're kind of targeting this for more
mature or maturing skin even skin tone
softens imperfections boost moisture
levels in the skin it has hyaluronic
acid in it which is great for
moisturizing plumps tightens has
pearlescent pigments to give you a
luminous glow interesting that they call
this a skin tint but also claims to have
medium to full coverage it has SPF 15
this foundation retails for $56 it has
one fluid ounce of product just comes in
12 shades I've lightest shade vanilla
which says light cool undertone I'm
going to cert swatches right here so you
can see how the shade vanilla compares
to some of the other foundations I own
okay so here are some swatches right
here is the hourglass illusion skin 10
in the lightest shade vanilla next over
is the hourglass Immaculate Foundation
in the same shade vanilla so there is a
difference between these two vanilla
shades I would say this one is a little
bit more peachy this one is definitely
lighter here's the hourglass immaculate
foundation in the shade pearl
let's over zvo a luminizing skin tin in
the shade opal derma called 2:08 and CYO
life proof in 101 if you've been
enjoying 15 days of foundation don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up if
you're new here you can join the BAE
radio family and subscribe we're on the
final stretch here we're shooting to
raise $20,000 for project need to share
so the link to the merch page will be
down below don't forget to vote one time
a day at the link down below for the
shelter that you want to win $5,000 and
I'm going to be doing a meet-up in that
city when I'm filming this is actually
the 15th so day one goes live tonight so
I'm really excited I've been seeing a
bunch of your photos come in wearing the
shirts and everything
and so far it seems like the Midwest is
pulling ahead so when this video goes up
I'm really curious to see which city is
winning so far but if you want to know
my thoughts on the hourglass illusion
hyaluronic skin tan you're in the right
place just keep watching so right now
it's a 9:15 in the morning day 11 I
plucked my eyebrows after 10 days so
here we go I'm feeling ready here's a
packaging I like the squeeze tube just
kind of gold heaven so watch this yet
let's take off the safety seal hoping I
picked the right shade now that I was
looking at the descriptions again I kind
of wish I went with one shade up I'm
thinking maybe I should have gone with
shale because that one says neutral
undertones my skin is washed moisturized
and prepped right now I think I'm gonna
try it out with the sponge first on the
side of my face no idea how much to get
here putting it on with the sponge what
it feels very sticky oh I have a feeling
this one is gonna be one I like better
with a brush because I'm getting
probably highlight coverage right now
you can see everything coming through
still but the finish of it looks
beautiful it's super sunny in Seattle
today so nice out so I went outside and
was drinking my coffee out and the Sun
was having a really good peaceful moment
at like 7:00 a.m. and then slipped an 8
 on ice I definitely spilled like
half my coffee everywhere but I want to
start doing that in the morning just
getting outside because when I film
these videos especially during 15 days
of foundation most days I don't leave my
house mostly because they'll have like a
red smokey eye on I do kind of plan my
whole schedule around these videos but I
feel like that makes all the difference
just getting outside in the morning and
like breathing fresh air you know what
I'm saying that looks gorgeous on my
forehead it's sitting beautifully
especially right on the center but
everywhere up here looks really nice ooh
I just got a whiff for this Tarte powder
so let's see what kind of coverage we
get with a brush I still haven't even
used a third of the amount I put out it
feels quite thick and definitely has
tackiness to it it doesn't feel like
it's the most smooth like easy to blend
product but it also it's not hard it
just feels like a gel it feels really
nice on my skin it feels super
moisturizing and still lightweight even
though the consistency is pretty thick
I don't feel like I have a ton of
foundation on or anything right now oh
man it's just like melts into your skin
I'm definitely not getting anywhere
close to full coverage though off of
that amount with the brush or sponge
brush I definitely got better coverage
on this side I'd say brush I got about
medium coverage maybe you can build this
up to full so I'm going to use a sponge
and just build up on the certain areas
that I need more coverage I want to see
this full coverage they're talking about
I don't feel like I got that much more
coverage yeah it's not building a whole
lot so I probably would just skip
building it up altogether you know if I
had acne with this one this would not
cover acne so if you have like rosacea
scarring any kind of major pigmentation
on your skin I would not call this full
coverage but it looks beautiful and wear
this for just when I want medium
coverage a shade is off it looks a bit
too pink for me and also it seems to be
kind of oxidizing I have a feeling I'd
be closer to the shade shell undertone
wise because I can see like a line where
it just looks pink this kind of
foundation I could see being really
pretty in this summer when I just want
to cover up some stuff and make my skin
look a little bit more flawless but
still have it look like skin to the
touch this feels like a gel so if you're
gonna be putting any kind of products on
top of this you will probably have to
set your face I'm gonna set this area
but so far I'm really liking this one
everything except the shade but it's now
9:30 I'm gonna do the rest of makeup and
I'll be right back so it is 10:40 but
the second time is actually 9:40 an hour
ago because I tried to apply these
freaking things hard oh no words never
been so frustrated trying to apply false
lashes we're gonna come back to these
when I tell you what's on the rest of my
face but let's take a look at the makeup
tie powder just my cheek area so I can
blend stuff and everything blended out
really easily on top of this with the
powder over it so I'm gonna start a clip
right here what it looks like a natural
lighting I'm just loving the way that
this makes my skin look I don't feel
like I have makeup caked on it feels
comfortable on my face I don't feel like
it looks like I have face makeup caked
on I know the rest of my makeup it's
obviously not a natural look but as far
as my skin
I just like that it looks like my skin
it looks really nice the only thing I'm
not liking is the shade and that's just
you know the shade so here's the flash
test this does have SPF 15 so we'll see
if it has a little bit of flash back at
all so quite a bit of flash back in this
one ignoring my under-eye area because
that's where a lot of like the
brightness and flash back is coming from
just looking at my forehead and stuff it
does look like there's flash back I
wouldn't wear this one in flash
photography does have SPF in it and in
moisturizer I've been enjoying lately
and have been using a lot as the jouer
luminizing moisture tint if you want to
see what this looks like on my skin I
wore it in the eyebrow permanent brow
update video just to give you a
comparison the hourglass illusion does
have more coverage than this one this is
very light coverage but the jouer one I
feel like look slightly more flattering
on my skin this one is very glowy the
only thing I don't like about the jouer
one is that it oxidizes a lot and the
lightest shade is already a bit dark so
when it oxidizes it's a little bit
orangie so on the rest of my face for
makeup I whipped out this which I
haven't used in so long this is the
Maybelline master contour in the shade
10 I use this shade kind of just like as
a bronzer mostly I blush is the BH
Cosmetics floral blush this is in the
shade Caribbean coral and I didn't dip
into the pink at all I only used the
coral shade right here which gave a
really pretty summery kind of cheek I
feel like springy summer I can't believe
we're actually going into spring
are we in spring but time this video
goes up we might be in the spring kind
of was shopping my makeup this morning
trying to use stuff that I haven't used
in a while so I used the Fenty Beauty
girl-next-door chic freak kilowatt
highlight do a thing I just go in with
this shade and I forgot how pretty this
is it gives a natural glow where it's
not shimmery at all this is when the
highlighter sits really beautifully on
top of texture I like this one way way
way better than the white one that they
came out with my eye shadow is all the
more FLE more sleek Jacqueline Hill
palette and then my lips are L'Oreal
tongue-tied I used a little bit of the
LA girl non-stop nude liner just to give
a little bit more definition to my lips
the lashes that I ended up wearing right
now are the pur cosmetics diva lashes
because try it out these magnetic lashes
fired
first I went in with the accent ones on
one I tried this then I went in with the
full strip ones which these are I don't
know it doesn't matter
nicely because I don't recommend these
they're basically like you stick one on
top and then the bottom one like
magnifies and sticks together to the top
one they're so hard to place though
because the top one doesn't have
anything to stick to so it's just kind
of sliding around I feel like this is
gonna take a long time to master I
wouldn't say these are for beginners I
first thought these were gonna be like
easier to apply than false lashes I
don't think they are maybe it's just
because this is the first time I'm
trying him but the accent ones were
50,000 times easier than the full strip
ones would not recommend the full strip
ones and then the accent ones they
basically just stopped so there's no
feathering out into your natural lash so
it just looks really obvious that you're
wearing them it's like bold bold bold
bold nothing the other thing is that I
don't feel like these were any more
comfortable on my eyes than normal Foss
lashes I thought you weren't really
gonna be able to feel them they actually
feel really heavy because there's little
magnets on here if you're just curious
and want to try these I would definitely
go with the accents over the full strip
but good luck may the odds be ever in
your favor so that's everything check-in
times 9:40 I'll see you guys in natural
lighting for the next check-in okay so
it's 1:30 so it's been on for about 4
hours not wait until the five hour point
because I have Chipotle coming right now
I'm postmates so I want to eat and then
get in the editing zone so I'm just
getting this check-in done with so it
looks like it's oxidized yeah it's
definitely oxidized looks pretty good
it's settling a little bit into a fine
line up here so settling a little right
here I do feel like I can see it on my
skin a little bit more than the jouer
skin tint for sure I like the way my
face down here is looking
creasing a little bit in the areas I've
been getting but not too bad at this
point there is a little bit though it
looks pretty good on my upper lip and
around my nose this is interesting that
my creasing has kind of changed from it
used to be like my upper lip and around
my nose
liyan now it's pretty much only around
here don't know why that is I feel like
if I had the right shade and it didn't
oxidize I would like it a lot better
right now but just looking at the
product I like it looks nice and glowy
and I'll see you guys at the end of the
night it's now 7:40 so it's been on for
10 hours I just went on a little walk
and I was wearing sunglasses because Sun
whoa and I was expecting when I take off
my sunglasses normally I have freaking
like caves on my nose where it just
totally rubbed off all the foundation on
the bridge of my nose
literally 99% of time I don't know if
it's just because I was only out for
like a half hour or what but I mean that
usually happens literally within like
five minutes and sunglasses with me and
I have a tiny tiny indent right here
which is mostly just where my concealer
is like nothing I mean there's a tiny
you can see a little bit of mark but
usually my foundation is completely
rubbed off on the bridge of my nose so
that's a good sign to me it's up close I
think it looks nice I don't love this
quite as much as the jouer skin tint
right now I would totally wear this one
again I feel like this is gonna be one
that I like right now and I would wear
it again in a different shade on its own
but I think again I can find a little
something with this whether it's a
setting spray or something to make it so
I really like this one but I'm gonna
play around with it I don't think this
is gonna be one probably for oily skin
but if you have more normal to dry skin
and you're just looking for something
with a little bit lighter coverage and
that's gonna keep you feeling pretty
moisturize throughout the day
this one looks really nice it's not
creasing around my mouth the whole lot
which is nice I'm gonna try and get a
sample of shell at Sephora so I can try
out that shade when I'm testing all
these out but I hope you guys enjoyed
day eleven if you did don't forget to
give this video a thumbs up I love you
guys thanks for watching see you
tomorrow wait 11 smiley the description
