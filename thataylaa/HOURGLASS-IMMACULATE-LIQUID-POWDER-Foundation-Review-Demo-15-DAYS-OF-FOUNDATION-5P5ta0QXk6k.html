all right so today it is day 4 of 15
days of foundation this is where I'm
testing out a new foundation every
single day for 15 days if you've missed
days one through three or any of them
all the videos I linked down below in 15
days of foundation playlist along with a
pale-skinned playlist a any playlist you
need before we get into the video I
wanted to quickly show you guys this
because in my time since I'm pre
recording some of these I haven't seen
these t-shirts yet I just got them in
yesterday so I'm super excited to show
them to you on camera these are 15 days
of foundation t-shirts if you missed me
talking about them in day one I'm gonna
like the video where I explain all about
the t-shirts down below
it smells like soul aminika gifs so this
is the 15 days of foundation t-shirt my
mom actually designed the brush right
here I designed the rest of it super
excited about it I want to see all of
your guys's photos wearing them I'll
retweet yeah you might make it into the
end of this video onto the foundation so
today we're going to be talking about
the hourglass immaculate liquid powder
foundation it's one of those products
that has been around for a while now
I've just never gotten around to trying
this out in the last 15 days the
foundation series I reviewed the
hourglass not was that in this series I
think I was in this series I don't think
that was a foundation Friday I tried out
the hourglass vanish stick foundation
and that I really did not like so I'm
hoping that this one works out better
for me this retails for $56 and you get
one ounce of product in here so
obviously this is on the pricier
high-end side there are 16 shades in
this foundation there's actually a huge
range for lighter skin tones I have two
different shades here I'm going to
insert some swatches right now but I
have the shade pearl and also vanilla
because I wasn't sure which one I was
going to be vanilla is the lightest cool
tone undertone and then pearl has more
neutral undertones there is a porcelain
in between there that has light with
warm undertones so just depending on
what undertone you are obviously pick
the right shade alright so watch time so
right here is the hourglass immaculate
foundation in the shade pearl here's the
same foundation in the shade vanilla
this Maybelline fit me in 110 this is
the ytube BB foundation I did a review
on yesterday in the lightest shade Josie
Maran Argan foundation in the lightest
shade and Tarte rainforest of the sea in
the lightest shade I'm going to read
some of the claims on here is
this is a breakthrough liquid to powder
foundation formula that absorbs oil
camouflages imperfections and delivers a
long-lasting velvet matte finish so it's
supposed to be long-lasting we'll see
how it holds up throughout the day it
says this high-tech foundation
incorporates cashmere clay choppers
exceptional oil absorption absorbing 75%
of its weight in sebum while retaining
the skins natural moisture this oil-free
humidity proof and water resistant
formula transforms instantly from liquid
to powder creating an all-day finish
blah blah blah doesn't look dull or flat
anything else that's interesting let's
see suppose to effectively eliminate the
need for powder blotting or constant
touch-ups throughout the day so it
sounds like by that description to me
this is geared more towards oily
combination oily skin versus dry skin it
also says it's infused with clinical
levels of two powerful anti-aging
ingredients that is everything that it
says online I hope you guys are like in
this series so far if you are make sure
you give this video a thumbs up at any
point if you want to see how this
foundation applies and wear throughout
the day you're in the right place just
keep watching all right so I'm already
wash moisturize to prime my face
use my UA anti blemish primer this dude
is still scaling the building right now
so hopefully you can't hear anything
whoa
okay it comes in this little sealed
thing whoops that just came out then you
have the top here that you're supposed
to attach yourself I'm going to shake
this really well it doesn't feel that
liquidy there must be something with
oxygen getting in this formula because
it's weird that they give you your own
pump to put on the street vanilla
supposed to be the lighter one but with
cool undertones and then the shade pearl
is fair both neutral undertones so to me
vanilla looks a little bit more orange E
and I think pearl has more of like a
beige neutral undertone so I'm actually
going to go in with pearl since this is
a liquid to powder foundation and my
skin does not do well with putting any
kind of cream or liquid products on top
of the powder formula I'm going to put
on my concealer beforehand it's
typically best to just go in with all
your liquid products before and then if
you have powder other powders you can
put that on after so I'm going to go
onto my Tarte shape tape concealer first
to conceal under the eyes not going to
do any small concealing because I want
to see how much the foundation covers on
its own but if you want a spot conceal
on your own now would be the time
looking like a Rudolph so I have my
Sigma f80 kabuki brush here that I think
I'm going to use on half my face it
actually says online to try using your
fingers working in sections of the face
apply a small amount using fingertips
blend and repeat work quickly as
Immaculate immediately transforms from
liquid to powder as you blend and then
it says apply with their brush for an
airbrushed finish sponge application is
not recommended so I think I'm going to
try my fingers first like they say on
this side of my face and then go in with
a brush on this side and see which one I
like better I'm just going to go in and
use my fingers like it says working in
small areas I can already tell that
working with my fingers is not going to
give me enough coverage is that super
super sheer they're literally outside of
my window right now so I'm going to let
them do their thing for a second and see
it starts
alright the very kind gentleman doing
the window offered to move down to the
other window for a second thank you sir
we got pretty much no coverage using my
fingers imma try it on my forehead just
to make sure but I think I'm gonna go
off the brush I used quite a bit of
product before I use more than that
probably twice this twice for this
double this feels like the why I sell or
that Maybelline Dream liquid foundation
i reviews on both of those from a long
time ago feel super thin and weightless
it applies fine with your fingers I just
I'm getting pretty much no coverage it
obviously covered some redness and stuff
but other than that not enough coverage
for me so I'm going to go in with my
brush on this side you know I think I'm
gonna go in with a second layer really
quick on this side with a brush because
I don't want it to fully set into a
powder and then have to do a second
layer on top of powder so I'm putting
about a dime-size amount on here I'm
just going to go on with my brush and
stipple it on okay way better coverage
with the brush fro sure just turn down
the light a little bit by the way I'm
only using my ring light today let me
know if you can see a difference in the
lighting usually have my ring light on
one side in my softbox on the other but
it's frickin bright and it kills my eyes
so I'm saying what it looks like just
back to the ring light today yeah way
better coverage with the brush I would
say
have about medium coverage now that
covered that redness and stuff pretty
well it feels extremely lightweight like
you almost can't tell you have anything
on right now finish wise the one layer
side looks a lot better it doesn't look
as powdery so I think if you want more
coverage with this definitely spot
conceal before you put this on I think
if I spot concealed I think I would be
able to cover all this stuff but I would
still have a really nice finish so it
didn't look like I was really wearing
makeup not getting insane coverage or
anything but I don't think that's what
this foundation is supposed to do it
does look very kind of weightless and
just doesn't really look like I have
anything on my skin so that's nice my
forehead looks a little textured I'm
actually going to try the sponge and
just kind of pounce right there yes that
helps so right now it is 8:20 I'm going
to apply the rest eye makeup and I will
be right back hopefully we can film this
intro and everything before they come
back okay so it's now 8:30 - whew that
was 12 minutes but yeah everything
blended out really beautifully on top of
it I didn't put a powder on it says not
to actually because it turns into a
powder so as it is supposed to
effectively eliminate the need for
powder blotting or constant touch-ups
throughout the day so I did not apply a
powder so we can see how it wears just
on its own as I was putting on the rest
of my makeup this reminds me almost
exactly of how the YSL fusion ink
foundation looks doesn't have a whole
lot of coverage but it looks really nice
and natural on your skin has a really
pretty finish if someone was just
looking at my face right now
I don't think it looks like I have a ton
of foundation on right now it's looking
nice I don't really have any critiques
right now I do have some dry patches up
here on my forehead that are a tiny bit
emphasized because this is a powder
finish I think if you have super dry
skin I don't know if you would like this
yeah because on my forehead where I have
some dry patches it is a little bit
clinging on nothing horrible at all but
you can just see it a little bit so
super quick on the rest of my face I use
the city color matte bronzer in the
shade caramel do you guys say caramel or
caramel I've always had caramel on a
wedge is it caramel I also put that in
my crease on my lid the only thing I
used is this light shade right here
the more feedback Kathleen palette
positions formula I booster I've been
using this brow pencil and I really like
this this is by benefit and it's one of
their new ultra fine brow defining
pencil I have the shade for I think yeah
for really like this you can literally
just draw on like hair strokes prequel
blush was the covergirl medium Rose
blush I think it's called put it down
below that since eyeshadow and zero one
snowflake is my highlight ups are color
pop cookie with the Too Faced lip
injection gloss and spice girl over top
so we're going to call the check-in time
8:30 I'm going to be wearing this
throughout the day have a lot to get
done today and my time Kendall just left
yesterday so I'm like playing catch-up
right now so I'm going to keep this on
my face and check back in throughout the
day the next check and I do will
hopefully be a natural lighting if
people aren't scaling the side of my
building still fingers caress fingers
crossed okay so it's now 140 so the
Foundation's been on for about five
hours and I just took a look in the
mirror we are in natural lighting right
now it looks good it looks almost
exactly like the YSL Fusion dings like I
said except I think a little bit more
matte that one tends to get a little bit
dewy throughout the day this one is
definitely a matte matte finish it close
you can see around my nose and upper lip
it looks pretty good like I'm not
getting major creasing on my upper lip
notice looks a little bit crazy but
that's pretty usual for me blush bronzer
highlight is still totally on no major
complaints right now at the 5 hour mark
it looks pretty dang good I've been
doing some work work also edited a video
clean makeup brushes got my car fixed
having a productive day so I'm gonna
wear this for a few more hours and I
will check back in at the end of the
night
alright so it's now 642 so the
Foundation's been on for a little over
10 hours that's kind of weird when you
think of your day in terms of bed let's
take a look first thoughts for being on
for 10 hours this looks freaking bomb my
forehead looks really good my oil
overall looks like it's pretty under
control there's not any areas that look
super super oily for me this forehead
just looks to me like dewy now but I
personally like that when it's not to
the point where it's oily around my nose
it looks like it's breaking down a
little bit I'm going to show you guys a
close
upper lip looks good nothing major on
any other parts of my face we're off a
little bit on my forehead where I was
moving my bangs and stuff and at one
point throughout the day accidentally
like nicked my nose right here and you
can see where the foundations weren't
off on my nose a little bit but overall
I think for bang on for 10 hours this
looks pretty dang good if you're someone
who likes more natural coverage and you
want something that's pretty long
lasting and mattifying I think this one
could be worth a go if you have dry skin
don't think this one's for you for me I
would totally wear this again if I want
a more natural look or if I spot conceal
first before putting on the foundation I
feel like that would give me enough
coverage and have a really nice finish
since it does have that liquid powder
consistency I would definitely say put
on all of your liquids first concealer
whatever if you're someone who likes
higher coverage this one probably won't
be enough coverage or if you have major
acne or any kind of scarring and stuff
you'll either have to conceal first or I
would just say pass on this one
but if you're someone who likes lighter
coverage and more natural-looking
foundation I think you could really like
this so if you guys liked this video and
you're excited about 15 days of
foundation don't forget to give this a
thumbs up you can tweet me with the
