did my makeup in high school I took a
trip down freaking memory lane looking
at photos for this video
overnight shipped a black wig off of
Amazon in honor of this video I pin this
back just so I can do makeup but I'm
pretty sure I used to part my hair in
the middle in high school because that
was a really good look I went through a
 ton of different phases in high
school I would say my weirdest phase in
high school was a headband phase where I
wore black eyeliner all the way around
my eyes and then I would put this giant
ass headband so you couldn't see my
forehead and I wouldn't take the
headband off our headband straight every
single day for like five months I'm
pretty sure or six months and on one of
my birthday's my parents put all of my
headbands at a bag and they were all cut
in half happy birthday to me I would say
my longest phase throughout high school
was the major Orange self-tanner with
black eyeliner all the way around my
eyeballs so that's what I'm gonna be
doing today
self-tanner was like my best friend in
high school so the look I'm gonna be
recreating in this video is this gem
right here not gonna lie this was like
one of my better phases first one was
actually when I was pale with the
headband with black eyeliner all the way
around my eyes great look tailored great
look but since this is what I did for
the longest amount of time we're doing
it today I had a really hard time
remembering what I actually used I
remember a few specific products but
everything else is kind of a blur one of
the things I do remember using everyday
is the Sally Hansen airbrush legs this
is actually a leg makeup but it's like a
tanner that just washes off it's
basically just makeup and I would put
this all over my arms but don't
worry I wouldn't put it on my hands and
go for the white hand look oh my god
look at this this isn't a light shade to
you guys this is like straight-up orange
I would put this everywhere except my
hands and feet so I would literally have
white hands but in the winter I would
only put it where it showed so I
literally only put this on my arms and
then my neck right here whatever was
showing like through my t-shirt by the
way this t-shirt was what I had in high
school I would go to the thrift store
every single day once I got my license
the thrift store
was like my jam we have one right by my
parents house and literally every single
day before he came home
I would stop there and get some hideous
t-shirt I actually liked his shirt but
the majority of them were like I was all
about the grandma section I feel like
I'm just painting right now
my roommates gonna come back and be like
what the literal when I'm done at
my high school it was like cooler the
less put together you were but I wanted
like old clothes old car my guess is
good better than the opposite I guess oh
my god I literally can't believe how
gorgeous is I wouldn't do my face but I
would do my neck I actually did this
still my freshman year of college I do
this every single day I went to school
somewhere where it was like not the
warmest so I'll put this only on my neck
where it came out of my winter jacket oh
my good that's good so now that we are a
bronze goddess over here
foundation when I wore like the white
gothic look I went with Revlon Colorstay
I'm pretty sure but when I was self
tanned like this I'm 99% sure I used the
maybelline superstay I can't remember if
I started using this freshman year of
college or if I was using this in high
school
actually love this foundation this is
one of my favorite foundations but I
just found out that they discontinued
this from the drugstore but I definitely
remember the powder I used to use they
also discontinued it was by Ulta and
this is like really what took my orange
face look over the top okay first let's
put on the foundation so I would just
pour this straight out no primer nothing
I would just put it directly on my face
with my fingers I had those little
triangle sponge things but I always just
use my fingers oh my god is not going to
be dark enough I'm pretty sure I use
this shade and then I would use this one
Ulta powder that was like straight-up
orange to match the rest of my body I
remember my dad giving me about the
orange face I thought my foundation
looks so good you guys my parents and
like my family would always tell me that
my face looked Orange and I thought they
were crazy I remember the only
foundation brush I used was this one Mac
one but I think I got for like a
birthday or so
and it was it was that one where you
literally like painted on and I grew up
in Southern California so everyone was
super tan super bronzed blond hair
surfer so I feel like growing up in that
kind of environment is probably why it
took me so long to appreciate my pale
skin honestly because all of my friends
were super tan in the summer everyone
would go to the beach and I'd be like
Casper I'm gonna go in with a little
more just to cover some of us up because
I didn't use concealer at all I would
just use foundation I didn't use
under-eye concealer I don't use any kind
of concealer alright my camera keeps
shutting off for zero reason so
hopefully we can make it through this
video so this is nowhere near as orange
as my face used to be like I said I use
this one Ulta powder foundation it came
in this white little compact I looked on
all to see if they still made it and
they don't but it was like a powder
foundation so the only powder that I
have in my collection right now that I
think might be dark enough is from the
morphe contour highest-quality
contour palette and I'm gonna go with
the shade right here and possibly mix
the darker one if that's not dark enough
I have no idea what brushes I used back
then I'm pretty sure you use my mom's
like Mary Kay brushes in high school
we'll see if this is dark enough Oh
doesn't look dark look I'm gonna mix a
couple of new shades see if I can get it
dark enough oh oh yeah these powders
though don't look that bad
okay look kind of good that's an
all-over face powder so I didn't do
anything to my eyebrows I actually have
tattooed brows on right now my eyebrows
were quite the scene I would pluck them
like super short and skinny bronzer I
definitely used this the lid is like
totally off this is by Sephora I don't
even know what shade this is in because
it's literally covered by foundation
yeah
like no idea I think it says Bahama I
pretty sure I used the same brush that I
use for powder for my bronzer so we're
going to do that today and I used his
 tone a bronzer but I didn't I
didn't contour like contour him wasn't a
thing back then so I would just like put
this on my cheeks and I don't think I
used blush or anything I would just use
this so eyeshadow I remember the
one eyeshadow that I use from Altos a
matte brown shade I don't have that
anymore but I also remember this
Maybelline palette which is actually
pretty good there's a couple shades in
here that are bomb these like to coppery
gold shades but I'm just going to take
this matte brown shade right here
because that looks pretty similar to
Ulta one and I'm just going to put that
all over my lid I don't know what
brushes I use but I know I didn't use
primer and I don't think I knew what a
crease was back then so just like put
this all over my eye basically eyeliner
Oh God when I got grounded in high
school my mom would actually take away
my eyeliner like that was my punishment
I vividly remember using the covergirl
liquid line blast this is the exact one
I used to have this isn't brown but I
also had a black one I can't find the
black one but these are actually aren't
bad cuz I can't find the black one I'm
just using this Milani ez liner I don't
know if she's a black liner and I would
literally line it the crap out of my
eyes I would just literally trace around
my entire eyeball so that's what we're
doing today I think I would dry on and
then I would like smudge it out pretty
sure I saw that tip in like Seventeen
magazine or something or American Girl
remember the American Girl Magazine her
book I would literally bring this all
the way into my inner corner and then
once I got to the outside I would just
keep going around and it would be like
super messy and I'm pretty sure I used
just the end of this thing to smudge it
out yeah this is totally used that's
pretty much it I do remember having this
one Maybelline liquid liner that came in
a grey bottle they still make it but I
don't think I started using that until
like senior year of high school pretty
sure when my makeup started getting
better better senior year of high school
was when YouTube started getting popular
so I remember watching some YouTube
videos in high school but it wasn't
until like the very end all of you guys
watching who are in high school right
now you seriously have it so much easier
than we all did because you have people
to actually show you and tell you what
to do when I was in high school it was
like I would just look at Seventeen
magazine and put on my face
there was no Instagram
there was no Facebook there was MySpace
okay mascara time so I'm pretty sure I
started with that pink and green mascara
the classic but I'm pretty sure I
graduated to the L'Oreal voluminous
carbon black at some point in highschool
I don't know if that was more towards
the end when I started watching YouTube
or if I just randomly picked this up I'm
pretty sure I put this on the bottom
lashes - okay so for lips I would use
the Burt's Bees chapstick in white that
is the only thing I put on my lips I
hated lipstick I hated lip gloss if I
didn't have that thing with me 24/7 at
all times would go down basically
was just like a tinted white lipstick so
it'd make my lips look kind of pinky
nude almost in all of my pictures
throughout high school I had this pink
white lip going on I don't have that
exact chapstick anymore I'm not sure if
they still make it but I have this white
lipstick by Maybelline that I'm going to
use and just kind of like dab this on
just to get the same effect so this is
how I did my makeup in high school got
those white hands though I would
recommend doing the complete opposite of
this but you know I thought it was a
good look at the time we're probably
gonna be saying the same thing about how
we do our makeup now in ten years but I
hope you guys like this video I got a
lot of requests to do this so give it a
thumbs up if you like this if you're new
here make sure you join the babe Reno
family and subscribe let me know down
below if you're one of the original baby
dough's who have been with me since the
self-tanning days kind of ironic that I
had my hair black like this for
literally ten years and then just within
the last six months I've changed it I
will definitely be back to black at some
point I love black hair definitely not
