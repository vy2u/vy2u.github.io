so today we have a video that I should
have put up a long time ago so today
we're going to be talking about how I
got rid of cystic acne it's gonna be
about the products I think help
lifestyle changes prescription
medication everything that helped to
completely clear up my skin I'm gonna
leave my last acne skincare routine
video linked down below before you watch
this video you should head over there
and check out that video that's where I
go in-depth about the history of my skin
what kind of skin I have things I've
done in the past to try and help my acne
this is going to be more about where we
are today and how we got here and all
that good stuff so I'm not wearing any
face makeup on my face right now this is
all acne scarring it's actually a little
bit redder than usual right now because
I just worked out and then wash my face
I'm going to included before photo right
now this is where my skin was at about
six months ago
if you look back on my get ready with me
videos you can kind of see like the
phase of my skin clearing up it wasn't
until the last two months where my skin
was literally clear my skin has been
pretty much completely clear for two
months I haven't been able to go out of
the house without face makeup on in
about three years or four years to be
able to go out and work out without
makeup on it just feels amazing I hope
that some of the things I mentioned
today help you guys keep in mind that
everyone's skin is completely different
some of the stuff that I mentioned might
work amazing for you some of it might
not work for you this whole getting rid
of acne process is more about learning
the triggers for your skin and what kind
of acne you actually have and then what
you can do to help get rid of it let's
get started so I did start seeing a
dermatologist and it didn't help me as
much as I thought it would not on any of
the medications anymore that she put me
on the more in-depth about that in a
little bit it helped to go to the
dermatologist just because I found out
that I did have severe cystic acne and
it was hormonal so it's mainly focused
on my chin and then down my neck I only
have about five products to mention and
this isn't my full skincare routine if
you guys want to see my full skincare
routine video let me know down below
these are just the products that helped
with my acne so my face wash that I've
been using is Neutrogena all-in-one acne
control I've been using this for about
five months this is my second or third
bottle I love this stuff this is my
favorite Neutrogena that face wash that
I've tried it does have salicylic acid
in it and it's supposed to help with
acne scarring
I use this every time I wash my face so
whether it's in the shower or in the
morning or at night this is what I use
my next product is my holy grail acne
product I gave you guys kind of a sneak
peak of my skincare routine on snapchat
so if you follow me on there you already
saw this this is the Neutrogena acne
stress control toner this is a toner so
you basically put it on after you wash
your face you just use a cotton pad and
rub this all over I do this that morning
and at night Reese acne eliminates oil
and shine Turner's helped to neutralize
the pH levels in your skin I've gone
through three or four bottles of this
now I was using this sophomore year of
college when my skin was really clear
and I just kind of
using it because I didn't think it was
doing anything once I started using this
stuff again this is when my skin started
clearing up like this is what like
kick-started the whole thing I will
never stop using this by this after my
toner and before my moisturizer I go in
with petunia skincare vitamin C serum
they sell this on Amazon and this had
really good reviews on there it's
basically a vitamin C serum but it also
has hyaluronic acid it's good for
scarring and anti-aging and all that
good stuff I definitely recommend using
some kind of serum and your skincare
routine especially after a toner so if I
really like this stuff it doesn't have a
horrible overpowering smell at all it
just smells kind of like cinnamon as I
continued using this for my scarring and
stuff I'll let you know how it's doing
but so far I really like it after the
serum you always want to apply
moisturizer I heard a ton of people
talk about the B nigma face cream I
wanted to try it out and see if it was
worth all the hype I've been using this
for about six to seven months now I can
honestly say that this is an amazing
face cream it is pretty thick so it's
definitely more of a night moisturizer I
use this at night as a last step in my
skincare routine it has bee venom manuka
honey and shea butter in it has
completely changed the texture of my
skin when I say family and stuff in real
life that knows what my skin used to
look like it's not even like they say
that my acne has gone away it's like a
comment on my skin thing that the actual
texture and everything of my skin looks
great and I think I owe it all to this
guy rock and ice is a super pricey face
cream I wouldn't mention it if I didn't
fully believe in it I do have a 25% off
code for this so hopefully that helps
little with the price personally I think
it's worth it and I would repurchase
this with my own money so when I went to
the dermatologist she prescribed me it's
not am i tripling what the heck is the
name completely blanking on the name
I'll have it right here I actually
stopped using that after about a month
because I had a weird reaction with my
migraine medication so I'm not on any
kind of prescription medication at all
besides this face cream and this is Taz
rock it's basically a super strong cream
you don't use this anymore this is more
for like intense acne my skin took this
really well it can be super strong and
dry
and like intense for me I applied it
once a day totally fine my skin didn't
dry up at all but I do think that has
helped to clear some of the deep ones so
those are all the products that I use I
want to talk about three different
things that I think tremendously helped
clear up my skin throughout this process
the first is learning that primers
massively break me out I don't use any
kind of silicone primer anymore the only
primer that I use is a body shop tea
tree primer this is suitable for
blemished skin I actually really like
the primer it doesn't do as great of a
job at like filling in pores but it does
help to just serve as a base for my
makeup I love the body shop tea tree
line I use their face mask it smells
amazing it feels super refreshing in the
morning when you put this on I know the
primers can be a trigger for a lot of
people so if you have silicone primary
try taking it out for a week or two and
seeing if your skin clears up at all
next is birth control I went on birth
control about six months ago I really
think it's a combo of all these things I
mentioning I don't think it's just birth
control or like just the toner since
I've been on birth control my skin has
been good if you're curious i'm on kim
resi low and it's the 3-month pact this
is a personal decision but just wanted
to throw it in there this is what i'm
doing next thing i changed in my
lifestyle i guess is drinking more water
this sounds like so cliche to me because
i remember on my last skincare routine
video people were commenting that and I
was like its water like what's it gonna
do but I started drinking more water
mostly because I started working out I
drink about 3 times as much water as I
used to
I usually drink about 5 to 6 of these
per day drinking tons of water just
helps clear out your system cleanse your
body get a cute water bottle or
something if it makes you feel better I
only like drinking water if it's in a
water bottle that I like drink up ladies
these are just the things that I've done
that helped clear up my skin it feels
freaking great having clear skin I've
had acne for so long that I forgot what
it looked and feel like to have normal
skin when I was in Atlanta they lost our
suitcases for two days and it had all my
face products in it my birth-control
like everything in those two days my
skin started breaking out again so
whatever I'm doing right now
is working do your own research figure
out what kind of acne you have and what
has helped other people with that kind
of acne it's a lot of trial and error so
that's what I've been doing for my skin
I hope this was helpful for you guys let
me know down below if you guys have any
products that you love for acne scarring
love you guys thanks for watching see
you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
