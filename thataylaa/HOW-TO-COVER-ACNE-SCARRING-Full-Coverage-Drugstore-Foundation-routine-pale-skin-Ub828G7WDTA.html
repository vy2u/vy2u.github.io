be about acne and how I cover it if
you've watched my videos for a while you
know that acne and I go way back
unfortunately I have tried tons of
different acne care systems and products
and I'm currently trying out a new one
I'm in the purge phase so my skin is
extra bad right now so I thought this
would be a good time to film a how I
cover up my acne video the medication
I'm on right now it takes about a month
and a half two months to fully do all of
its magic so let me know down below if
you guys want a review on it once I'm
done with the system in the meantime we
just have to cover it all up the stuff
that I am sharing with you in this video
is all drugstore products it can be
really difficult to find products that
work for your skin especially if you
have acne prone skin and are on a budget
and have fair skin this is stuff that I
have tried and it works for me and it
doesn't break up my skin so I'm going to
pass it on to you guys if you want to
see how I get this flawless looking face
then just keep watching
all right so here is my face with no
makeup on as you can see I'm having some
pretty awful cystic acne down here this
one has been here for about I don't know
four days now I'm in the middle of
trying out a new acne product and they
say that you're going to have a purge
phase so I'm pretty sure I'm going
through the purge phase right now this
side of my face isn't too bad this is
mostly all acne scars right here I
usually get it down my chin and on the
right side of my face I think I sleep
with my hand on my face or something
like that because it's always only on
the right side of my face so when I want
a full Pepperidge face it isn't going to
clog my pores and make my acne worse I
usually go with ELF acne fighting
foundation this is super reasonable I
think it's about six dollars from Target
or you can get it online the lighter
shade is too dark for me this is in the
shade ivory so what I do to make it work
is mix it with Manic Panic dreamtone if
you watch any of my videos well just
like which if you watch any of my videos
you probably heard me talk about Manic
Panic dreamtone I have a whole video on
how to lighten your foundation so I'll
link that down below and this does have
salicylic acid in it and witch hazel
so it'll hopefully help your acne rather
than make it worse when it's on your
face we're a little bit of this on the
back of my hand then we go ahead and mix
in Manic Panic I usually have to do two
pumps with this foundation since it is
hella dark so I've already primed my
face with my Maybelline primer so after
I've mixed my foundation with clean
hands I just like to rub whatever is
left over on my face and then I go in
with my favorite brush to apply liquid
foundation and this is the Sigma f80
flat top kabuki brush 1 make sure your
brushes are clean whenever you're
applying them to your face especially if
you have acne prone skin because you
don't want to contaminate your brush and
then put it back on your face and it's
just a bad cycle to get into I do have a
whole video on how to deep clean your
brushes as well as spot-clean them I
like it over here if you want to check
those out I hope you guys can hear me
it's the fans not on right now
that's out so in spots like my forehead
where I don't have that much to cover up
I usually just like to concentrate the
most product in the middle of my face
and then blend outwards so whatever is
left over on my hand I just like to run
through the brush and then kind of
stipple it on the spots where I have
acne if you got to make a dub shanky
what you got to do while we're letting
this set on our face a couple of my
other favorite foundations for acne
prone skin with full coverage is the
maybelline superstay foundation the
lightest shade of this one is pretty
freakin dark probably an NC twenty five
ish around there so you do have to mix a
lot of Manic Panic with this if you have
fair skin if not this will be perfect
for you and another favorite is revlon
colorstay
there are two different formulas that
combo oily skin one is my favorite it's
amazing yeah these are my faves
alright so on to concealer the ones I've
been using for forever and I just love
the way that they look and work and
everything is the Rev one age defying
concealer I'm almost out of this guy but
since it is too dark I mix it in with
NYX lavender concealer the HD stuff so I
just mixed that on the back of my hand
again and I just like to use this for
under my eyes and then whatever is left
over I kind of gap over any acne spots
even if you don't have super dark
circles under under your eyes if you're
going for a full coverage look which you
probably are if you're trying to cover
up your acne
I've definitely recommend just throwing
on a little concealer under your eyes
because you can just see the difference
that it makes it kind of just makes your
whole face look brighter and will draw
less attention to your sort I'm looking
for I don't know shitty areas on your
face imperfections there we go sounded
great this combo does dry pretty fast so
you want to work quickly so I'm taking
whatever's left over and I'm just going
to dab it on these huge planet-sized
acne so to set the under iowa set the
under eye concealer my favorite powder
you already know if you've seen any of
my get ready with me shadow news videos
but this is the Physicians Formula
translucent light setting powder is
actually a correcting powder but if you
have fair skin it's perfect because it's
actually light enough so I just like to
use this with an elf powder brush and I
just go
pat this on aware of a concealer for an
all-over face powder to set everything
use what works for use we're going to
use the Physicians Formula mineral weird
help free powder this stuff is great if
you have acne prone skin this powder is
a little bit too dark for me so when I'm
not using this I'm using the Ben Nye
luxury powder and cameo you can't buy
this at the drugstore but it's drugstore
priced if that makes sense you can get
this off of ebay or amazon a link down
below this is really great if you have
fair skin if your about half a shade or
shade darker than me this would probably
be perfect for you so to apply this I
like to use a Real Techniques powder
brush is actually the blush brush but I
don't know how the heck someone could
apply blush with this thing because it's
huge alright so I'm going to put the
rest of my face on and we will be back
alright so here is what my face looks
like after I finished the rest of my
makeup pretty much all of my acne is
covered I feel great going out like this
just right amount of coverage you can't
see that I really have cystic acne
besides the raised parts which you can't
really cover up so I hope this helps
some of you guys on the lips is these
two products mixed I'll link them down
below if you want to check them out I
think that's everything
love you guys thanks for watching and
see you next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
