why are we wearing a long-sleeve nose
alright so today we're gonna be just
chillin and talking about something a
little bit different than usual so I
literally just got home from work to run
some red lipstick didn't know I was
filming this video in my how to have a
full-time career and do YouTube video
which I will link this I over here can't
remember pretty sure it's over here
it'll be in the I and the description
box ask you guys if you want to see a
whole series about YouTube advice and
just things I've learned and a lot of
you guys have your own channels so I'm
hoping this will be helpful for you
talking about YouTube is something that
I'm super passionate about and I feel
like I don't do enough on my channel my
career is also in this industry so I
feel like I kind of have like a
two-sided perspective both from being a
youtuber and then also being on the
brand side I'm not gonna be making more
videos related to YouTube I just figured
this will be like a starting point for
you guys and a good place to start off
this series or whatever we're calling it
I'm not gonna be making a video about
the technical side of getting started on
YouTube like what camera and stuff to
get because I just feel like a dinosaur
now there are so much better cameras
that have come out since I started
YouTube so I'm sure you can search and
find a relevant video on that topic
if you're curious but today we're gonna
be talking about how to grow your
channel on YouTube so I started making
videos on my channel about three years
ago in the first six months I got to
10,000 subscribers which especially back
then was a lot in a short amount of time
kind of right at the peak of that growth
I took a year off from YouTube because I
was living abroad and that was just a
personal decision I think as we talk
about this topic the most important
thing to keep in mind is that it's not
about the number of subscribers the
value in a good YouTube channel is the
engagement engagement and the average
views you get per video are so much more
important than the number of subscribers
from a brand side I can tell you that if
someone has a YouTube channel with 2,000
subscribers but they get 5 10,000 views
per video I'm gonna go with the channel
that has 80,000 subscribers but that has
good average views and that has actual
engaged subscribers who care about what
that person is saying
enough to comment about it gage with
their Instagram posts like the video
those metrics are so much more important
to look out for then the amount of
subscribers so as you picture what
growth looks like in your head
throughout this whole video just keep
that in mind I'm not solely talking
about the number of subscribers so the
first tip I have for growing your
channel sounds super cliche but I have
to mention it super quickly there's a
reason why everyone mentions this you
have to be yourself I think that there
are so many people trying to build this
story I've been build this narrative
around someone that isn't them a big
part of that is making yourself feel
good and putting out content that you're
proud of and that you can make without
putting on a whole act the other part of
that is that people can tell when you're
putting on an act people can tell when
you're not yourself you can tell when
someone's not passionate about something
they're talking about and it just
reflects on your channel overall if
you're passionate about what you're
talking about and you're being yourself
as much as you can sitting in a room in
front of a giant-ass light you're gonna
enjoy making content so much more and
people are going to see that and react
to that I think this is especially rare
in the beauty community there are so
many people trying to be a certain kind
of beauty guru or beauty vlogger
and just stop just be yourself
personally I think people are constantly
looking for something different in
something new and if you can be that
person then great my next tip when
growing your channel is to teach
yourself and do research just like any
other thing that you do for the first
time you're gonna have to teach yourself
a lot and I think that's why a lot of
people give up with blogging and with
YouTube because it's not easy it's not
as easy as just flipping on a camera and
the video magically appears and you get
millions of views that's not how the
world works anything that has good
rewards typically isn't the easiest to
do at the beginning especially you'll
probably have to do some technical
research like how to work a camera how
to edit how do I don't know what are
tracking like super basic things like
that but also just do some research on
the industry overall what our YouTube
trends YouTube SEO what is SEO if you
don't know what YouTube SEO is its
search engine optimization SEO is it so
industry in its own perfection way I
think of YouTube is you wouldn't start a
job and start working at a company
without doing any research beforehand so
why would you do that on YouTube you're
on a new platform for the first time why
not optimize your channel and do what
you can for it by covering the basics
like SEO I could do a whole video on
YouTube SEO and best practices for SEO
so if you guys want to see a whole video
on YouTube SEO let me know in the
comments down below
that would be really fun for me to film
because I love talking about this stuff
especially at the beginning I would say
putting out the right content that
people are searching for is super
important perfect example this is my
video that has the most views on my
channel to date which is my how to paint
wood furniture without sanding video
nothing related to beauty but I went to
paint my furniture realize that there
was no videos on this yet and I made the
video if there's something that you
can't find that you think other people
are probably trying to find to make the
video personally I think as focused as
you can get the better especially at the
beginning there are so many get ready
with me videos there's so many what's in
my bag videos there are so many out in
the day videos the chances of someone
finding your video that has pretty much
no views on it yet is pretty damn low
when your videos get to a certain point
where people are commenting on them and
engaging with them and liking them and
sharing them YouTube takes that into
account and says hey other people might
want to see this let's boost it higher
if you're not even getting the views yet
there's no way for that to happen and
the only way for you to get views is to
make that specific content that someone
might be searching for another tip and
this one is more geared toward beauty
bloggers or beauty bloggers but if
you're someone in the beauty space who
is trying to start a YouTube channel and
grow a YouTube channel honestly today I
would start out on Instagram Instagram
wasn't around back in the day when I
started YouTube or it was like just
coming out Instagram is such an amazing
place now to kick start your YouTube
channel if you look at a lot of
successful instagramers follow what
they're doing in your own way if you're
super talented that makeup and that's
what you want to do and that's what you
want your channel to be about post high
quality photos on Instagram tag the
brand's try to get them to repost you
and share your content
befriend other instagramers and
youtubers in the right way and there's
such a right way to go about doing that
that could be a whole of their video but
grow your platform on Instagram and then
once you have a solid community there I
would say about least 10,000 take that
community and send them to your YouTube
channel if you already have a base
somewhere else whether it's on tumblr or
Pinterest or anywhere else if you
already have that existing community
it's so much easier to get your content
found on YouTube and send them directly
to your YouTube channel also kind of on
that note cross promote your content no
one knows that you have a youtube
channel or that a video just went up
unless you tell them and you send them
right to the video I think one of the
biggest things I've learned from doing
YouTube is that no one does anything
unless you tell them to do it which is a
whole other art but people aren't going
to know to do something and take an
action unless you over balae tell them
to do that or literally tell them to do
that in an instagram caption or tweet or
anything else without being super spammy
try to cross promote your YouTube videos
across all of your other social channels
doesn't even matter if you have a phone
if you have 20 Twitter followers it
doesn't matter the fact that you're
active on there and people are gonna see
that they're gonna want to follow you
and get to know you better promote your
videos still tweet because no one's
gonna follow you if you're not active
and I think that's something that's
really hard for people to wrap their
head around sometimes is like I'm I'm
making a video but I'm literally talking
to no one or I'm tweeting but no one's
following me why am I even tweeting
you're gonna have to get used to that
while you start YouTube because that's
how you start everyone goes through that
awkward phase of feeling like they're
posting for no-one and I think that's
also why you have to be doing it for the
right reasons which I talked a lot about
in my last YouTube advice video if you
love what you're doing the fact that it
takes a long time to grow or that you
know you're putting out content for
knowing at the moment like all those
things don't become as important because
you're happy doing what you're doing
regardless personally the thing that has
most helpful for me besides trying to be
myself and focusing on YouTube SEO as
kind of a growth strategy is engaging
with your community there are so many
people who either choose not to comment
back or who think that they're too busy
or who act like they're too busy you
need to invest in your people we have
built a whole Bay Rideau community
around my channel if you're a subscriber
you're part of the Bay radio family
spoiler alert coming out with favorito
fam march soon I don't care if you work
40 hours a week you can take 20 minutes
every single day while you're peeing or
while you're walking to your car while
you're in an uber to respond to comments
because those are the people who take
the time out of their day to watch your
content I genuinely believe that people
recognize when someone does do that and
is engaged with them I'm not going to
comment on a channel if I've never seen
that youtuber respond back growing your
community and investing in your
community comes so full-circle depth not
with and I a hundred percent stand
behind that I don't care if you have 500
thousand subscribers it is so much
better to have a channel a half of the
size or a fifth of the size even that
has a hardcore group of people that will
like jump off the planet Earth with you
if you jump off I mean that was really
helpful when I started that has kind of
died down a little bit is collabs people
don't collaborate as much anymore on
YouTube I'm not sure if it's just like
the YouTube culture changing a little
bit or if there's so many youtubers now
that people almost feel like more
competitive to me I still do
collaborations with people that I
genuinely want to collaborate with one
of the most annoying things that you can
do is ask a youtuber who's 10 times your
size to collaborate with them especially
when they've never once spoken to you
build relationships first build
friendships first and if you think that
your audience would genuinely like their
channel asked to collaborate I've
collaborated with some of my best
friends on YouTube Holly it slopes take
Kendall Rae even if you don't do any
collabs your entire YouTube life make
friends on YouTube it's such a good way
to have a support system when you get a
shitty comment or if you have a network
question or a contract question or a
technical question I text with my
youtube friends all the time about the
kinds of things there's people going
through the same troubles that you are
and I would say my last tip again is
just do it because you're passionate
about it if you're in it just for the
money stop because that's not gonna
happen for a couple years and try not to
get frustrated it can be really
frustrating and discouraging sometimes
when you feel like you put your all into
something and you're not seeing the kind
of growth or whatever it is that you're
looking for that can be really
frustrating when you start focusing on
the numbers and when you start focusing
on things too much you can kind of lose
sight of the big picture and why you're
doing it in the first place
so that's just what's worked for me I
hope these tips were helpful for you
guys probably going to be looking back
editing this thinking of like 20 more
things I could have said if you're just
stumbling across this video you can join
the baby doe family by clicking the
subscribe button they'll be notified
