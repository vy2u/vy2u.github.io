your face all right so today we're going
to be talking about how to contour and
highlight fair skin I know when I first
started playing around with makeup this
was one of the things that was super
difficult for me to find the contour
shade light enough and highlight
actually light enough for my skin I feel
like it's taken me a while to find
products that work with my skin but I'm
super satisfied with what I've been
using lately so I want to share with you
guys if you're new to my channel I do
have a ton of videos on foundation
and products and powders and everything
that are good for people with pale skin
pretty much any of my shadow to schmooze
videos I do my foundation in so I'll
link those in the down bar so you can
check them out so if you want to see how
I contour and everything you're in the
right place just keep watching all right
so I have kind of the base of my face
makeup on I primed my face with the
Maybelline master prime blur and
illuminate primer which I absolutely
love
and then I went in with the L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte foundation I like
this because it is lighter there's a
full-on storm outside right now I like
this because it is light enough for my
face I don't have to mix anything in
with it I'm not a huge fan of the finish
but it does say Pro matte on it so it
wasn't expecting something doing see
basically just want to apply a
foundation so we have a clean even
canvas to apply all of our contour and
highlight on top of it so my favorite
concealer to highlight the under eyes
and just brighten everything up is the
NARS creamy rating it's a NARS creamy
this is what happens when I try and fill
the night radiant creamy concealer in
the shade Chantilly if you have fair
skin this is like the perfect concealer
if you don't have fair skin get this
concealer and your shade obviously the
formula and everything is just
everything that you could ever want in a
concealer so I'm gonna apply this under
my eyes I hope you can't hear that it's
freaking loud I apply this under my eyes
and this is going to help highlight the
under eye area and conceal any dark
circles or anything you have going on
under there this stuff is super full
coverage I just like to blend it out
with my finger I feel like that applies
the best for me or blends out the best
for me as you can see this is a super
light shade which is great because it's
really hard to find concealers that are
actually light enough for my skin tone I
also like to bring this on top of my eye
to cover up any freckles or whatever
everyone else have freckles on top of
their rival this concealer does drive
super fast they have to work really
quickly and probably make your life
easier if you just did one eye at a time
so I don't do that so to match the
lightness that we have going on under
the eyes I'm going to apply a little bit
of concealer to the middle of my
forehead down the bridge of my nose in
my Cupid's bow in the center of ocean to
blend this part out I just like to take
a stippling brush I'm just going to
blend this in ignore freaking planet
Mars on my forehead right now so we have
a couple options for setting the
under-eye my go-to Holy Grail is the
Physicians Formula translucent setting
powder which you know if you watch any
of my videos a consistency color
everything is just perfect it is a this
supposed to be a correcting powder but
when you blend it all together it just
is like a super pale shade if you don't
want as intense of a highlight going on
under the eyes you can use the
Maybelline fit me powder in the shade
100 translucent and also use this all
over your face if your similar shade to
me I'm going to go in with my Physicians
Formula powder on a Ecotools
kabuki brush this thing is frickin huge
I usually use my ELF powder brush for
this but I kind of destroyed it pressing
that in and I just like to press it on
top of my concealer this brush is kind
of foolproof because if you just press
it in it kind of covers the exact like
triangle that you want if you put
concealer under your eyes you definitely
want to set it with the powder a lot of
times the powder can change the color of
the concealers that's what I like to
find the super pale powder as well to go
on top of it so I personally like to set
my under eyes first and then set the
rest of my face so today just set the
face I'm using Too Faced primed and
poreless the L'Oreal foundation you
don't really
you'd like it feels pretty freakin dry
right now actually probably don't need a
powder at all but just to make our lives
easier since we're going to be blending
a lot on our face today I'm just going
to go ahead and set everything you also
use the elf translucent powder whatever
it's called I'm just using that same
Ecotools brush and this stuff is really
powder you can probably see it flying up
everywhere but it's really great for
setting everything and it just makes
your face feel so freakin soft you
definitely don't want to try to blend
your contour and everything right on top
of your foundation especially if it's
still setting it's going to be really
difficult to blend out and it'll just
make your life way more difficult you
want to make sure you're just patting
this rather than blending because you
don't want to blend off our foundation
take a tea break we're ready to go all
right so our face is good to go my
favorite brush to contour is the Sedona
lace FBO 5 brush this is just the
perfect dome-shaped contour brush this
brush comes in the vortex brush set
which is my favorite brush set they do
have a coupon code if you want to use
that illicit down below so contouring is
basically where we're going to sculpt
out all the parts that we want sunken
into our face and then we're going to
highlight the ones that we want to stand
out we're going to start by contouring
the cheekbones and then a little bit
around the forehead that's just where I
like to contour I know some people
contour at the jawline and down your
nose too I just keep it basic and do my
cheekbones and my forehead so I'm gonna
go in with a nude matte palette which is
actually an eyeshadow palette with
fair-skinned it can be pretty tricky to
find a light enough contour shade
sometimes a way to go is just use an
eyeshadow this shade right here is the
one that we're going to use today you
could also use this one if you're a
little bit darker this cool-toned one
right here or you can mix the two
together whatever floats your boat the
trick with the contour shade is that you
want it to be cool toned contouring is
different than bronzing here's another
one you could use this is Mac taupe and
then this would be a bronzer so you see
the difference in color a couple of
their options for contour NYX blush in
raisin which definitely is more purpley
but it actually works for me I actually
really enjoy it next blush in taupe is
another classic this one's a little too
dark for my skin tone but makeup
revolution London Eye
this is in the shade delicious if you're
a couple shades darker than me this will
probably be perfect for you
this is literally a pound which equals
like a dollar fifty so this is super
affordable I've been obsessed with this
brand lately spent way too much money on
their site all right so we're gonna go
in with the eyeshadow shade from the new
maps palette on FB oh five brush I'm
gonna start at the top and just kind of
do circular motions the great thing
about using eyeshadows is that they're
also usually easier to blend out at
least for me so when you contour you
wanted to start at the top of your ear
and kind of go in the direction of the
corner of your lip you don't want to
pull it too far down so that's just
going to look funky usually just want to
bring it about a third of the way and
then like slightly blend it in at the
halfway point I'm just going to do a
little bit more in circular motions now
we have a cheekbone this brush is just
the perfect size I feel like to get in
the hollow right there we're just going
to take a little bit of that same shade
and we're going to start to just shade
our forehead that's what that's called
whoa out of focus sorry there's going
right at the hairline of blending that
in that was the time where you could
contour your nose if you were feeling it
I feel so out of my zone when I film at
night you think I'd be more awake but
I'm literally like I don't feel like I'm
filming right now and next I want to
highlight my cheekbones you probably
switch up the order in the next few
steps this is just what I like to do I'm
going to go out of the makeup revolution
trio in Ultra fair I've been freaking
obsessed with this highlighter lately it
is super pigmented so you just need a
tiny bit the bronzer is also really nice
we might use that later I don't know the
blush kind of rounds we have NARS orgasm
just overall super great affordable
palette and my in focus right now who
knows so to apply my highlight I'm using
the Sedona lace FBO one fan brush look
at this thing like how could you not
want to put this on your face this
brushes things me so happy I'm just
going to literally tap this in the
product because is so pigmented you
shall see so the good thing about this
brush is that the way it's shaped it
literally just places the product
perfectly perfectly so you want to play
your highlight right on the top of your
cheekbone right here well feels really
right here so with this brush you
literally don't have to think about it
you just pop it on look at how frickin
pretty that is whatever is left on the
brush I'm just gonna run down the bridge
of my nose and on my Cupid's bow another
good option if you don't want to order
makeup from the UK is essence glue me up
in the shade rose it up this is a really
great affordable option this is like $3
or $4 definitely a little bit more pinky
but this totally still works if you have
fair skin next I'm going to use the
essence blonds bronzer we're just going
to warm up our face with this when I do
full-on like contour and blush and
highlight and everything I do like to
add a little bit of bronzer just because
I feel like it brings back the warmth
into my face so to apply this bronzer
and use the FBO 3 tapered brush by
Sedona lace and we're just going to kind
of warm this up around our face I'm
using a super light amount on this
pretty much the same spots as before but
just blending it a little bit more
around my face what are we doing alright
so for blush I'm gonna go in with elfs
candid coral this is like three dollars
I think this is one of my Holy Grail
blushes I haven't mentioned this in a
while on my channel I used to be
obsessed with this like probably a year
ago I've been kind of going away from
the corals but I'm feeling it today
another option what I usually use on a
daily basis is essence blush up this is
on their own bray blushes in the shade
pinky flow this thing is so freakin
pretty favorite blush brush lately has
been the Sedona lace ether teen
stippling brush you literally don't have
to think about applying your blush it
just happens
I was going to blend this
usually like to bring this pretty far on
the apples of my cheeks just because I
feel like that's what looks most
flattering on my face shape if you don't
know where your apples are just smile
I cannot smile with my mouth closed
feels so awkward alright so this last
step is totally optional this is just
for the people who want to take their
highlight up a notch I'm going with this
Sedona lace contour palette and there's
a pure white powder in here which is
freakin amazing I love this palette you
could totally get by with just using
this just for like a quick contour I
would totally combine these two shades
and use that my cheekbones I've done
that in a few videos I do love this
white powder I think it's so much better
than my it cosmetics palette that I sent
like $50 on its whole palette I think is
like between eight and ten dollars if
I'm right somewhere around there
supplies I'm just going to take a small
tapered brush and we're just going to
put this under our eyes on top of what
we did with the Physicians Formula
powder in that triangle shape and this
is just going to help to super highlight
everything I'm also going to put this on
the center of my forehead since we never
put the Physicians Formula powder over
here basically putting this in the same
spots that we initially put the
concealer alright so this is the final
look after obviously the rest of my
makeup is on my face I do have a shout
and schmooze video on how I got the look
I'm wearing right now so I'll link that
in the downbar you guys head over and
