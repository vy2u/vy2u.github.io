lighten your foundation no matter what
your skin tone this product is probably
going to be very helpful for you so
we're talking about the Manic Panic
dreamtone vegan flawless foundation and
color corrector and it is literally a
white liquid this can be worn by itself
if you're rocking an extremely fair skin
it can be mixed in with other
foundations it is amazing I've talked
about mixing foundations in previous
videos but this makes your life so much
easier please don't die battery why I
say this is amazing for any skin tone is
that we all have that foundation that is
a tiny bit too dark or when you're
transitioning from the summer months
into the winter months and all of your
foundations are suddenly way too dark
for you you can just mix a little bit of
this in with your foundation and it
matches your skin this has been my
lifesaver now I can literally wear any
of my foundations and make them light
enough for my skin tone so let me tell
you a little bit about this foundation
so it has a pump which is amazeballs I
got it for about $12 off of Amazon I'll
leave the link down below if you want to
try it out yourself doesn't have a
distinct smell to it which is nice don't
really have anything bad to say about
this I've been wearing this everyday I'm
obviously wearing it right now as you'll
see in the demo and I absolutely love it
I also have the Manic Panic virgin white
press powder which I mentioned and I
think my February rays and rejects video
and it is literally just a completely
white powder this is also great if you
have really fair skin and need to set
your foundation or just under your eyes
which is why I use it for manic panic
has some really great stuff for my pale
princesses in this video I'm going to be
mixing it with my all-time favorite
maybelline superstay foundation just
because that is my all-time favorite so
now I will leave you to the demo so you
can see what it looks like I think it's
here on my lip so basically what you do
is just take your darker foundation I
like to just use the back of my hand
and once you do this a few times you'll
know the exact amount of foundation that
you'll need but I just take that on the
back of my hand and then
put in a couple pumps of the dreamtone
as you can see it's pretty thick and
it's just literally a white liquid so
then I mix it in on with my finger and
you can see it getting lighter it's
really hard to mix in the viewfinder and
that's it i'm using the sigma flat
kabuki f82 blown this into my skin I do
like the consistency of it it feels more
like a full coverage foundation and as
you can see my foundation matches my
neck now that's always exciting it kind
of just takes charnel and ir to figure
out your foundation - Manic Panic ratio
that is it super easy to apply literally
just like a normal foundation so if you
liked this video and it was helpful for
you be sure to give it a thumbs up so I
know if you have any other good
foundations for super fair-skinned let
me know love you guys
thanks for watching see you in my next
video thank my I just switched like 10
times I can't believe I just recorded a
whole video without any coffee in my
system I am impressed with myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
