alright so today's video is going to be
a little bit different where you going
back to the tailor talks so if you saw
my current foundation favourites for
fair skin which if you haven't I will
link it right here and it'll open a new
window I mentioned maybe possibly doing
a video about how to love your fair skin
and a lot of people were interested in
that and so now we're here I don't
really have any direction I'm going in
this video I'm literally just gonna talk
and share my opinion and there we go so
we kind of have this societal belief
that tan skin are being bronzed are
being you know sunkissed it is how we
are supposed to be that's like the in
thing I'm not saying that people who do
have darker complexions are not
beautiful I don't think there's one kind
of beautiful and that's kind of the
whole point of this growing up I always
thought of having a pale skin as this
negative thing I wanted to be tan like
my friends I didn't understand why I
couldn't get tan I'd always burn and I
would get freckles and they would just
disappear back into white not turn into
a tan and everyone liked friends family
members everyone used to come in and be
like why don't you get a tan why don't
you get some Sun and it's just a bunch
of stuff that builds up and you begin to
think that your fair skin is not
beautiful I remember having this
conversation with my aunt when I was
like 13 and her telling me like one day
you'll love your fair skin you'll
embrace it and she was totally right
I see all the time on Instagram on
Facebook whatever just yesterday I was
on Instagram and there was like a group
picture of girls and someone commented
saying something like the chick in the
front needs to tan those like pale last
legs
I don't know where this whole tale is
bad idea came from but who are you to
tell someone that pale isn't beautiful
if you have something that sets you
apart from everyone else then that's
great that's what makes us different
I've gotten comments saying like why
don't you go out in the Sun have you
ever heard of self-tanner
I make a conscious decision to embrace
my fair skin it's not saying that I
don't use self-tanner every once in a
while because in the summer sometimes I
do use self-tanner you know if you're
going to be wearing a swimsuit and stuff
sometimes I want to be tan and that's
okay but I'm also okay with my fair skin
and I actually prefer it to when I'm
self tan so how I kind of like shifted
my thinking about this I remember being
in high school I used to wear
self-tanner everyday I hated my fair
skin one day I was so sick of playing on
self-tanner that I googled like how to
love your pale skin something like that
and I remember all of these blog posts
and stuff started coming up and there
were like girls there were guys
commenting and I remember reading like a
bunch of guys that were like I actually
prefer women with fair skin and like
that thought never really clicked in my
head because we're so ingrained to think
that like tan is beautiful tan is what
you should be to remember being like
thoroughly shocked if there were people
out there that liked fair sin and
thought it was like attractive and
beautiful not saying that you need a
male's approval to love your own skin
I'm just saying that something in my
history or in my experience that helps
me realize that it was an OK thing I
don't think it was until college until I
really like actually preferred my fair
skin when I went to Jordan last year
having pale skin is like this godsend
thing in general people don't really
have fair skin there so it's something
that is unique and it's very like
beautiful to them I think being in the
Middle East really made me realize that
my culture tells me one thing and being
with different people and in another
culture is like different values of what
is beautiful I'm just seeing how in the
u.s. how we value more tan skin and then
being somewhere completely different and
they value the complete opposite and I
know it's not just Jordan it's a lot of
different countries one culture isn't
right and one culture isn't wrong
there's just different views and there
isn't one definition of beauty and I
think that is kind of the point of all
of this is no matter if you are
naturally tan or if you would naturally
have fair skin who is anyone to tell you
that what you're born with isn't
beautiful you look at my videos before
Jordan I'm all self tan dand bronzed up
and everything don't put any self-tanner
on in Jordan after I kind of had this
like in PIFAN II all of my videos since
then I have been completely in my own
skin fair skin and this is me I know
like a lot of people were commenting and
being like you know people just tell me
all the time or make comments about how
my fair skin is ugly or how I need to
change it or whatever and my advice to
you would be to ignore them who are they
to tell you whether your skin is
beautiful or not you need to find that
happiness within yourself and accept the
skin that you were born with you can be
beautiful and have fur your skin you can
be confident and have fair skin you can
love your skin and have pale skin I hope
that helps some of you guys if you have
more questions leave them down below I'm
pretty good about responding to your
guys comments so leave them down below
and we can talk so if you like this
video and it was helpful for you be sure
to give it a thumbs up but button be
sure to give it a thumbs up so I know
shout out to all my pale princesses love
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
