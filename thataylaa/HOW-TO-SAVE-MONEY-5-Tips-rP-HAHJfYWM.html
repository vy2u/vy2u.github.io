money shopping online kind of just
shopping in general video I do most of
my shopping online so these are kind of
things that I use to save money if
you're shopping online addict just for
you if you're not you will be after this
video sorry the makeups a little intense
right now because I did just film a
shadow and schmooze video so you want to
see this look I'll link the video down
below it might be up after this I'm not
sure so I'm just going to talk about
some of the sites and apps I use to save
money or just small things that I do so
if you want to hear how to save money
then just keep watching all right so the
first thing I'm going to talk about is
this app that I've been using lately and
it's called shop euler and i am obsessed
with it i'll show you the interface
right now it's basically this app where
you can search all of the deals and
coupons and things that's going on you
can select the stores that you want to
show up on your app and it notifies you
when there's a sale going on or a coupon
or anything like that
I usually just check back every Sunday
for the new weekly ads to go up which I
love because I used to have like 10
different apps the rite-aid app and
walgreens app and all those things just
to look at their weekly ads but now I
can literally just do it from the shop
Euler app and what I really like is that
it doesn't redirect you to their site it
keeps you on the app and it just opens
instantly you can get Ulta coupons on
there it doesn't just help you save
money but for me the thing I really like
about it is it saves a ton of time
because you don't have to search through
all these different sites and apps
there's just everything in one place so
every Sunday I just kind of scroll
through the ads and deals and stuff and
see where I can save me some money so
the second way I like to save money
shopping online specifically is using
Ebates I use this literally every time I
shop online basically gives you cash
back every time you shop online you
literally get a check in the mail but I
like to do is before I make a purchase
anywhere I go on eBay say I'm buying
something from
I type in Victoria's Secret it'll be
like a percent cashback or four percent
cashback whatever it is it constantly
changes so you have to go check back and
see when they're like double cashback
sometimes they do triple cashback you
never know so then you just click the
link and it redirects you to Victoria's
Secret and it'll track that purchase so
it'll give you a percent cashback on
whatever you buy they also give you a
free ten dollar Target gift card or you
can choose I think there's like other
places first time you purchase over
twenty five dollars from anywhere even
if you're gonna use it one time
literally just do that you'll get a free
ten dollar gift card to basically get
$10 off in conjunction with eBay so I
like to use retailmenot.com
I use that only for coupons and tells
you how many times it's been used that
day and the ones that actually work so
you don't have to go through like trying
out a ton of coupons and get a free
coupon so why not my next favorite site
that I use to save a ton of money
and I actually don't you know if I save
money I just kick deals on that I
don't need is Amazon I used to be an
avid eBay buyer and I've kind of
transitioned to Amazon lately I don't
know why I've gotten a lot of stuff for
my room on Amazon I got this wallpaper
from Amazon I got the chair for my room
from Amazon this is quick and easy I
decided to get Amazon crying because I
buy so much stuff now that it's stupid
not to because they spent so much money
on shipping some of stuff like even
makeup is a lot of the times cheaper
than the drugstore so I would just check
before you buy anything see if it's on
Amazon it probably is and it's probably
cheaper a lot of people have don't like
shopping online because they don't want
to wait for it to come in the mail but
if you just think ahead and think about
what you're gonna need then you can
order it and discounted price before
you're like outta luck and have to
go run to the store and get it
overpriced so the last thing I do is
just old-fashioned couponing and my
couponing I mean like the red plum kind
of coupons like coupon books that come
in newspapers I'm lucky because our part
man building we're out right now the
mailman just leaves all of the coupons
it's a little slot thing and no one
takes them it'll just be like sitting
there for a week so I wait like good
week and then I take everyone's coupons
coupon addict but most coupons you can
stack a lot of times like
things like hair dye or L'Oreal always
comes out with tons of coupons but those
kind of things I wait until I have two
coupons and I'll stack them on top of
each other and I'll end up paying like
two dollars for an eight dollar thing I
used to be really into couponing and I
kind of toned it down a little bit but
you really can save so much money it's
literally free money sitting right there
final tip I have for shopping online and
saving money just in general this is
more of like a budgeting thing I usually
like to keep a certain amount of money
in my PayPal account and that is my like
go to kind of play money if you will
money that I get from my actual work
paycheck goes directly into my savings
account and I just leave it there and
that's where I pay for rent and bills
and stuff that's a good way to just
living yourself from overspending so
that is everything comment down below if
you guys have any other sites or apps or
anything that you like to use to save
money I'm always down for good couponing
app or something like that so let me
know like I mentioned I did film a
shoutin schmooze on this look which will
either be up before this video or after
this video it's already up I'll link it
over here and I'll link it in the down
bar when it does go up yeah I think
that's everything
love you guys thanks for watching and
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
