I'm doing is applying heat protectant as
well maybe hopefully you make it so your
hair doesn't get as damaged while you're
applying heat to it I'm taking the
Infinity curling wand bike owner you can
get this off Amazon
the way I like to curl my hair is
placing the wand behind my head and then
curling away from my face my opinion
this just gives you the best looking
girls I hold it there for about 20 to 30
seconds until the hair gets hot and then
I let it go and then right away I like
to spray each piece that I curl with
hairspray just to make sure that it
stays and the hairspray I'm using is by
Pantene pro-v so then I'm going to take
another small section of my hair and
just do the same exact thing if you want
your curls to be bigger and looser
you're just going to take a bigger
section of hair I like to do tighter
curls and then at the end I'm going to
come through with my fingers kind of
loosen it up so this is basically all I
do with my whole head of hair
strangers to you
once you get to the other side of your
hair you're gonna do the same exact
thing this site is always trickier for
me to hold but you're going to do the
same thing and just curl your hair the
opposite direction of your face does
that make any sense curl your hair away
from your face and then we're just gonna
spray it with hairspray again and voila
so when you're doing this the fatter
part of the curling wand should be faced
upward and the skinnier part downward oh
wait should I say that one more time so
this is basically what I do for my whole
head I'll show you my bangs in a second
if you like to tease your hair and now
would be the time to teach it I don't
use my hair because it's too thick to
hold appease basically just separate out
my bangs you're gonna place the one
behind your bangs and then curl if you
have a one-inch one this is gonna look a
lot better it's at my college storage
unit thing so I didn't have it but this
works fine you're just gonna have to
play with it a little more to make it
look normal
so here is what it looks like looks
crazy when you first take it out but
like I said we're gonna play with it and
move it around and yeah there you go
so now I'm just taking my fingers and
kind of lightly coming through the curls
to loosen them up a little you could
leave it how it is but I like mine a
little more wavy instead of like ringlet
curls so yeah just running my fingers
through and
and as one hairspray everything will end
up this is how I get big ass bombshell
curls if you liked this tutorial click
the thumbs up button and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
