this is absolutely ridiculous
and I'm starting my no buying spree
right now I'm like overwhelmed staring
at the pile of shit I have to show you
guys hauling is so stressful this is
like a shit ton of stuff I got like
swimsuits clothing makeup everything so
if you want to see a like 20 minute haul
here we go first I'm gonna do what I got
at Alta first thing I got is the NYX
matte bronzer and this is in the shade
light and the actual bronzer is actually
in my room because I've been using it
and I love it
it's probably my favorite bronzer I've
ever tried I think this was like $8.99
next thing is the NYX jumbo eye pencil
in milk if you guys watched my videos
you know I wear this every single day
love this stuff I literally don't go day
without wearing it it's just a matte
white pencil that you can use as an
eyeshadow base or I use it in my
waterline it's just multi-purpose I
think this was like 449 or something
like that next thing I got which I'm
super excited about is the NYX GG Studio
liquid liner in extreme coffee missus
brown liquid liner and I tested this on
my hand in the store and waited for it
to dry and tried to like smudge it off
it didn't budge so I was like okay I'll
try this when I got home I put my hand
under the faucet and I was like I was
probably gonna come right off
stayed on then I use makeup remover
wipes and this is the result after the
makeup remover wipe so it literally
doesn't budge this was like 4:52 not
sure but I'm really excited about it and
I think I'm gonna go back and get a few
more colors then I got the OPI nail
polish and just spotted the lizard and
it is like this gorgeous crazy green
blue color it reminds me of like peacock
or something this is just like a really
unique color last thing I got at Ulta is
this essence get big lashes waterproof
volume boost mascara and look at how
in huge this tubas I was kind of scared
up first because the brush is like
bigger than your whole eye the reason I
picked this up was because I wanted a
good cheap mascara just a new one to try
and this was 329 I think and it is super
good for separating your lashes and
lengthening it haven't tried any essence
beauty stuff until this mascara I was
like swashing everything in the store
and they have some good shit next I'm
going to show you some of the bikinis I
got there all Victoria's Secret brand
except for one which is from Walmart so
this is the one I got from Walmart it's
this white with gold like what is that
snakeskin I don't even know and it is
super push-up so if you have like
non-existent boobs like I do then this
is perfect for you so it's 16 dollars
and that is super cheap for like a good
push-up swimsuit compared to the
Victoria Secret ones which are like 40
dollars and then to go with that I just
got plain there's like this businessman
walking outside white bottoms from
Victoria's Secret and they're just tied
and they also have little gold beads
these bottoms from a tort suit that I'm
about to show you were super super cheap
I got all of them on like ultra
clearance these were the most expensive
ones and I think these were like eight
dollars and then I just got two random
bikini bottoms that I can just put with
plain black tops and I've been looking
at this print for forever and wanted
they're like miraculous top thing but
it's super expensive so I was like okay
I'll just get the bottoms and put it
with a black or like fuchsia top and
these were 329 on clearance just really
cute and bright and have like crazy
pattern designs that I like and the
other bottoms I got from a choice you
get online are just the dream polka dot
and then they have these black sides and
these are also 329 like that's freaking
crazy these are normally like $30 at
Victoria's Secret
the last swimsuit top I got it is also
Victoria's Secret brand but I
got it from MJR sails calm if you guys
haven't heard of that site you're
missing out it's basically a site that
sells returned victoria secret items and
Victoria Secrets brand is called famous
catalog so under MJ our sales comm
search famous catalog and then you can
get all these Victoria's Secret clothes
for like incredibly markdown prices and
so I got this like mint neon green
push-up triangle top four it was like
six eighty or something ridiculously
cheap like that just gonna pair it with
the white bottoms or black bottoms that
I already have alright so then I have
some clothes to show you guys I went to
Old Navy and Old Navy has really good
clearance stuff if you didn't know that
super cute stuff they marked on pretty
much everything so the thing I'm most
excited about are these heels and if you
know I have midget sized feet so it's
incredibly hard for me to find heels and
they had these heels in size five the
strings are fucking everywhere okay so
basically they lace up your heel like
this and have these really cute this
really cute pattern on them and then
they're like tan in the back and these
were on clearance for $13.99 but they
were also having 30% off clearance
prices so I got them for like I don't
know nine something next thing I got at
Old Navy is this like chiffon tank top
is like this crazy bright yellow color
and it's just really loose and has a
little bow right there where it ties and
this was on clearance for 949 but it was
also thirty percent off that and I got
to work out things because I'm like
trying to motivate myself to work out by
buying cute workout clothes so the first
thing I got is this sports bra just like
Heather or what is that I don't know
some kind of grey material and this was
on clearance for 749 and it has pads in
it which I like because yep they're
non-existent and then I got this workout
top which is actually really cute it's
like this bright
neon coral tank top and it has
drawstring at the bottom so it's not
gonna like show off your love handles or
anything so it's like loose all the way
and then tie it at the bottom and this
was 1494 and I went to TJ Maxx and found
these shorts and I was like I don't even
need more shorts but I have to have
these because they're leopard how
freaking cute are those they're like
cut-off denim leopard shorts these were
14.99 from Charlotte Russe when I went
to the mall with my friend I just got
this necklace that's super tangled okay
this necklace in it oh it matches the
shirt I'm wearing right now and it's
just like one of those statement piece
necklaces and it was originally 850 but
all of their jewelry was $5 that day and
then at Ross I am so freaking excited
about this if you guys are Betsey
Johnson fans and you know that she went
out of business and everything is like
completely marked down and I was like
you know what that means TJ Maxx and
Ross are gonna be full of that shit so
we were walking around and I see you
like these makeup bags and I was like I
bet you Betsey Johnson is in there sure
enough this one which is like I couldn't
even pick out a cuter bag for myself and
it has her Betsy Villa logo right there
and then it spools and roses and purple
and it's just perfect and it also came
with a smaller one like a smaller one
this size and that one is in my purse
both of those together were can't find
the tag but they were 1699 and it was
normally like 58 but then I'll show you
what's in this Victoria's Secret bag so
when I ordered the swimsuits online from
them they gave me a coupon for like a
free lace panty I got to pick out any of
the ones it's like a lace back I don't
really care about showing underwear so
if you're weirded out by it then go but
they're really cute like roses and then
the back is just lace obviously so I got
those for free so that was cool and then
from their semi-annual sale I got this
luminous cheek face highlighter in the
color Showtime and I use this the other
day why do I look pale as shit
focus pocus come on turn normal colors
pay for some reason it's only semi
normal colored when the bag is right
there so we're gonna keep it there but
anyway so I got the luminous cheek
highlighter and the packaging looks like
this I don't know how much this normally
was is probably at least I'm guessing
like at least ten and I got it for 350
because all of it all the makeup was
like 75% off I'll swatch it for you guys
I don't know if you will be able to see
this without any like sunlight but it's
just this gorgeous cheek highlighter and
I use it right over my liquid foundation
before I put on my powder and it just
gives you like a really pretty glow and
then I also got one of their lotions
that was like 75% off so I was like
three dollars but that's in my purse
also but I did want to share this with
you guys I got a $10 off your order
coupon that you can only use online I'll
let July 6 through July 31st
I'm guessing this video will be up
between that it's like a ten dollar gift
certificate basically you can't use it
on clearance or anything like that but
I'm not going to be using it so I
figured I might as well give it to one
of you guys so I'm going to put the code
right here so whoever is the first
person to watch this video that wants to
use it will get $10 off their Victoria
Secret comm order Oh have fun happy
shopping I'm going to show you stuff
that I got from the drugstore I went to
CVS Rite Aid and Walmart all to tried
and find this freaking Maybelline BB
cream that I can't find anywhere got it
on my Walmart but it was sold out and by
the time those videos up I'm probably
already going to have a review on that
so future me good job for finding that
if you follow me on Instagram you know
that Rite Aid was having spend $8 on wet
and wild get $3 up reward and there are
40% off so I got a bunch of wet and wild
stuff but I'm just gonna show you the
nail polishes if you want to see what
else I got just go on Instagram so
there's four nail polishes
one is this like right pink color and
it's in tropic Kalia and yep right pink
and is this super light pink like a baby
pink next it's in the color sugarcoat
and it's just this pastel pinky color
called on a trip and this is the color
that I'm wearing on my ring finger right
now and the last color is club Havana or
Havana whatever instagrammed a picture
when I was wearing this color I really
really like this color it's like a
bright orange II peach kind of then also
at Rite Aid it picked up the Revlon
Colorstay this is like the gel their new
gel nail polish and this is in the color
Provence I've heard good things about
these nail polishes okay so these were
like nine dollars at Rite Aid and then
when I went to Walmart they had them for
like for something do I got the base
coat and top coat and I absolutely love
these the base coat alone makes your
nail polish stay on I'd say at least two
days longer than the normally would and
then with the topcoat these are like
unstoppable together you gotta get them
so I'm wearing the base coat and top
coat on my nails right now so you can
see how shiny they're got Walmart I
picked up the Revlon color silk and soft
black this is my hair dye and I also am
trying the Dove Hair Therapy risk free
shine cream serum and I decided to try
this because I really like their dry
shampoo which is also from this line and
it smells hmm it smells amazing I can
get the lid on okay so the last thing I
got the drugstore I got that CVS and
it's the covergirl outlast all-day lip
color and this is in the color sweet
burgundy and it was 50% off as you can
see so it was like seven something it's
normally kind of expensive I always see
its Judy hi talking about these and she
says that they last all day and she can
kiss Benji without the red like
transferring and stuff last two things I
got are not like makeup or clothes or
anything like that just things that I
