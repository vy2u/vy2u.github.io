resisting the urge to eat a burrito
right now maybe just a shot I love how
they called these Maxie fries they're
literally just frozen tater tots so in
the last couple weeks I went to
Sacramento to see my cousin and then I
also went to Southern California and I
got a got some stuff the drugstores are
just on a whole new level in California
they get all of the new stuff first
they're always like fully stocked it is
a struggle to find a new products in
Seattle you have to go to like ten
different stores to find one thing so
first let's do CVS I went to CVS in San
Diego and then Cosmo Prof with my cousin
in Sacramento I love it CVS because you
can get some really good deals if you
work the system right they basically do
like cash back I'm blanking on what they
actually call it right now but they do
there it's not up rewards that's writing
what's it called extra bucks
I think someone's call so if you split
up your transaction you can basically
use the extra bucks money that you get
it like an instant coupon and then use
it towards your other half of your
purchase so if you do it the right way
you can actually save a ton of money and
get stuff basically for free if you
watch my channel for a while I used to
be super into couponing I just don't
have the time anymore but I love it okay
so I picked up a bunch of stuff I wanted
to try out some new drugstore face masks
so I picked up two the first is the
Nippon fab skin brightening mask it
sounds of like colic acid in it and I
heard talk to you glam like flavor guru
mentioned that she likes this brand of
face mask I don't know which one she
likes but I wanted to try this one it is
really tiny and this was pretty pricy
for the drugstore I think this is like
$13 and it is pretty small it says its
high potency pore tightening gel mask
this is the beauty 360 detoxifying
purifying facial mask with active
charcoal I thought this was gonna be
like the kind of like the origins
charcoal mask and this is nothing like
the origins charcoal mask this was
probably my least favorite face mask
I've ever tried it is a super okay
that's all over my pants this is a super
jelly kind of mask it's like it's weird
you put it on and you feel like you're
not really rubbing anything into your
skin now that I have this out
show you on my hand so you can kind of
see but it literally just is like it
feels like a gel moisturizer almost you
can't you can't even feel it like it
feels nothing like a facemask and then
you wash it off and it just feels like
it did nothing for your skin they're
having buy two get one free on certain
brands and you can mix and match them so
if it's products that you're already
gonna get you might as well stock up
L'Oreal is one of the brands so I just
stocked up on the infallible makeup
extent or setting spray this is my Holy
Grail favorite setting spray this feels
kind of empty I'm guessing I use this
every single day helps you makeup stay
on longer I just love the way that it
makes my skin look gives you like a
little bit of a dewy finish and then I
got two of my Wet n Wild mega length
mascaras in waterproof this is what I
use for my bottom lashes it has the
perfect size comb to get in there it
doesn't transfer you to your concealer
and they're like a dollar ninety-nine I
don't know what prompted me to pick this
up this is the covergirl refined rose
cheek kind of trio whatever this is
called I just thought this would be nice
to like mix these kind of shades I don't
know I really don't know why I picked
this up I'm not a huge fan of covergirl
I haven't really found anything from
covergirl that I'm like super wowed by
but I feel like I need to give them more
of a shot so we're trying this out we'll
see how it is I'm really excited to try
this I've been really into the shine
controlling primers lately I love the
makeup forever that I mentioned in my
raisin rejects video that one is amazing
this is supposed to last eight hours
eight hours I'd control with or without
makeup has a matte finish and extends
the wear of makeup I like using oil
controlling primers and then putting
like a dewy foundation on top that way
you don't look oily your skin just looks
healthy throughout the day let me know
if any of you guys have tried this and
what you think of it
this was 14.99 so pretty pricy for the
drugstore but I did use the buy two get
one for anything I always go in phases
of getting a lot of questions about what
teeth whitening stuff I use and then
it'll just like die off for a while and
that's when I know I need to wake my
teeth again but I've been getting a lot
of questions lately and all I've changed
is my toothpaste I switched to the
Colgate optic white toothpaste I can't
remember if I mentioned this in
rejects video I definitely mentioned it
in one of my videos but this is a
sparkling white one I really like the
Express version of this but I can only
find it on Amazon for some reason super
good sale in this it was originally 350
and then you get 250 off and then I
think you also get a up reward or some
or a cash back thing if you're looking
for a good whitening toothpaste that
actually works try out this line if
you're a coffee drinker it just helps
get those stains off and yeah there's my
teeth picked up an extra cool here
picked up an extra Physicians Formula
translucent setting powder this is what
I use for under my eyes every single day
it's a correcting powder but it's super
pale so if you in pale skin this is
excellent for under the eyes because
it's really hard to find a super pale
powder I'm so happy that I finally found
this shade of the Revlon Ultra HD matte
lip color I didn't want to purchase the
whole line and like do a review on them
just because I feel like those the other
colors I would never wear but I really
liked this one
this is what it looks like oops
it smells like um that flavored play-doh
you have been getting really good
reviews so we'll see it doesn't like a
matte at all to me it's pretty the
opposite of matte actually I've looked
at ten different stores for that one
shade this is in the shade seduction
alright let's move onto Cosmoprof you
don't know Cosmo Prof is basically a
beauty supply store so if you have your
beauty license you can shop there and
you basically get crazy deals everything
is super marked down because it's
basically at the cost that salons buy
the products anyone can go in there so
if you just want to look you can go in
but you obviously can't buy anything
without a card this was my first time in
Cosmo Prof and it was glorious I felt
like I was in Disneyland I get more
excitement in Cosmoprof than I do the
actual Disneyland so I got a few things
and I got really good deals on all of it
because it's literally like over half
off Paul Mitchell clarifying shampoo - I
wanted a good clarifying shampoo because
I use a ton of product in my hair I can
go a while without washing my hair I
usually start putting in the dry shampoo
on like day three or four because my
hair doesn't really
oily once I put the dry shampoo in
there's just tons of like product
build-up at my roots so I wanted
something to help get rid of that it
smells very citrusy I've been using this
for about a couple weeks now and it
smells super citrusy which I'm not
usually a fan of but it does the job
I usually go in with this on my roots
and like do a good scrub and then go in
with my other shampoo for just all over
my hair next I turned out the kenra
thermal styling spray so this is a firm
hold he activated styling spray you can
use this for straight or curly hair
styling which is what kind of appealed
to me using dry hair so after you
blow-dry your hair you spray it in and
then you can straighten it or curl it
whatever I've only tried this for
straightening my hair and I didn't like
it for that it made my hair feel very
sticky almost too firm for straight hair
I feel like if you're doing a curly hair
kind of look you might like it because
it'll actually hold the curl better but
first straight here I like my hair to be
like soft after I straighten it it
smells just like Garnier Fructis this
bad boy on the other hand I'm in love
with and I'm so glad I got it I was kind
of in the store debating back and forth
whether I was gonna get this so this is
the G G I have to think about every time
is it the Chi tea tree oil trio and this
is like one of their holiday says my
cousin was saying that right now is the
best time to go to Cosmo Prof because
they have all these holiday sets that
are like insane deals this trio it comes
with this the serum and then a face mask
hair mask this was 15 dollars for all
three so five dollars product I talked
about this and the hair mask in my race
and rejects video so I'm not gonna go
too in depth about that but I love both
of these I haven't tried the tea tree
serum yet I got some spa essentials
cotton rounds is there just three-inch
cotton rounds it was like 250 for this
whole bag of 80 which is a lot better
than the drugstore and these look like
they're actual good quality like they're
not gonna pull apart that is my pet
peeve when you use toner and then you
have the cotton many things coming off
all over your face so kind of pads
exciting so this is pretty new from OPI
I think this is the infinite shine line
does it's a gel effects
lacquer system comes with a primer base
coat of color and then a topcoat you
don't have to cure this with a UV light
but it is
make your nails look super shiny and
kind of gel like it says it's supposed
to last up to ten days I really like
this shade right here I think when I
actually take this off and try this out
now that I hold it it is so dusty if you
wanting to try out kenra for a while and
I just never pick it up out alta because
it is pretty pricey
I usually don't splurge on hair products
I just feel like a lot of the times the
drugstore ones are so much better
especially like the shampoo conditioners
I've never found a high-end shampoo and
conditioner that I like better than a
drugstore one this is the blow dry
shampoo thermal protectant shampoo and
conditioner and then as they're super
popular a blow dry spray in here I think
this was like seventeen dollars for all
three a Cosmo Prof last thing I got at
Cosmo Prof is the Kendra silk Ning
Kinross opening mist batteries done
great this is a tiny travel sized
version just I wanted to try it out
before buying the whole fake version so
far I like it it just makes your hair
look super shiny we can test it out
right now right now I have my hair
straight this is hard without a mirror
smells really good and just makes your
hair super shiny but that is everything
the batteries die good timing I'm about
to go eat my taco time I do have a video
on the look I'm wearing right now so if
you want to see how I got this look I'll
leave it in the down bar below love you
guys thanks for watching and see you
