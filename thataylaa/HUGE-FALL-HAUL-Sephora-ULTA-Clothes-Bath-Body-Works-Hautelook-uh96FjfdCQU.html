he's not there wearing a frickin like
that lipstick on Mandi alright so today
we have a fall haul kind of thing didn't
think I was doing this but then it just
kind of kept piling up in the corner of
my room so I thought might as well fill
Mahal right this shopping was very
stress induced its retail therapy I did
need some new clothes for fall and then
all the other stuff I bought it didn't
actually need but make about it we're
just gonna start with y'all store with
the makeup alright so there's been some
exciting things that have come out
recently mostly high-end stuff that I
wanted to try out so the first is the
Too Faced cocoa powder foundation this
is supposed to be I think a medium
coverage and it smells like chocolate
and it smells heavenly let me know if
you guys would want to see a review on
this product this is brand new the
lightest shade is actually light enough
for me I'm actually wearing it right now
on top of another foundation yeah let me
know if you want to know my thoughts on
this thing next I cannot believe I'm
holding this in my hands this is the YSL
brand new fusion ain't foundation sounds
similar to the Maybelline Dream liquid
foundation that I've been obsessed with
it's like I'm blinding you guys with
this box right now if you saw in my
oddest recent rejects video I've been
kind of obsessed with the Maybelline
foundation because it doesn't feel like
you're wearing anything on your face and
I just feel like it looks really nice
and natural on the skin
this isn't Shady to be ten porcelain I
saw one blog post on this with someone
that had fair skin and it looked like
enough for her so I'm excited to try
this out let me know if you guys want a
first impression or review on this thing
should we take it out of the box now I'm
just going to keep it in there next I
just stocked up on my benefit
Porefessional almost out of my mini
version so I needed a backup for when I
run out I really like
I think it does help my foundation last
longer and minimize my pores on my face
I like it alright now on to Ulta I
literally was gonna leave my wallet in
the car
and just browse the aisles didn't go
very well I got four of the new NYX vamp
simply vamp lip creams actually one of
them two of them are not the vamp
lengths they have pink ones nude ones
and a red collection all within like the
simple.you lip cream line can I explain
that really poorly probably let's just
organize these these two are from the
vamp collection these two are not I'm
probably going to be doing a review and
swatches video of these one of these is
supposed to be a dupe for Mac cyber this
one I'm wearing on my lips right now
this is in the shade knockout these are
retractable so you just wind it up and
they retail for about six dollars I
think around there alright so then I
picked up these two essence products
this is the essence blush powder blush
pinky and pinky flow and this is an
ombre blush and it is so beautiful these
are super affordable they had one other
shade I don't know if you guys can fully
see that there we go
I am very pleasantly surprised with this
blush I've used it a few times now I'm
all about my tart Dollface
blush it's a very similar shade except
it's about 20 dollars cheaper and it
just glides on so nice I've never used a
blush like this it just is like so
velvety when it goes on your skin
bronzer I got is the Sun Club bronzer by
essence for blondes and it says lighter
skin so holler it it looks pretty dark
even for light skin it was kind of
interesting because the one for darker
skin looked like it had more of a topi
tone to it and those are usually the
kind of bronzers that I go for a fair
skinned you don't really want to be
doing an orange thing so we'll see how
this works I haven't used it yet but
look how big it is it's like as big as
my face is like three dollars from Fred
Meyer that's what I find all of my
essence by the way Fred
has an amazing essence section you can
find Fred Meyer if you're in the Pacific
Northwest region how long have I had
that oh my dude so then I ordered a few
things off of a hot look I think you can
get $10 off your first order I think
I'll leave it down below so first thing
I got is this macadamia natural oil curl
cream that I've tried they're deep
conditioning mask I think it's good I
think it smells good I don't know if
I've noticed a significant change in my
hair from it but there's like a cult
following behind it so I basically just
needed a curl product truck so when I
saw this like half off on hot look oh
yeah the next thing I got is a Rebecca
Minkoff purse actually I'm just going to
talk about it first and then show you
because when I put it in the camera
everything else goes dark so I am NOT a
person at all I think the last purse I
bought was from Jordan which would have
been two years ago now I wear it every
single day and is starting to like break
and I kind of I'm starting to look like
a homeless person
I figured I should probably invest in a
new purse I think it's time so since I'm
not really a purse person I figured I
would just invest in a good one that's
gonna last me a while then I don't have
to deal with buying another purse
I feel so not girl right now but yeah so
hot look was having Rebecca Minkoff way
markdown sixty something percent off
when I saw this one and had studs and I
really liked it I just bought it so this
is called the mini crap was it called
Darrell with Darrell I think is Darrell
couldn't find the mini version anywhere
else online so I don't know if I don't
know what's going on with this style so
here is the purse it's a white leather
and then it has these gold studs I hope
am I even touching the gold over there I
haven't even taken out the inside stuff
yet I hope it's gonna fit my laptop it
looks like it will so then I was walking
through the mall and bath and Bodyworks
happened happens every time I can't stop
it I tried
to resist the urge but it wasn't
happening I didn't want to be that
person who includes fall candles in
their Hall but here we are so I got to
fall candles where is the label there we
go the first one is sweater weather and
the second one is tailgate I still have
candles stocked up from last winter I
have no idea how to describe sweater
weather
I like really musky sentence that smell
like men to put it simply this one
doesn't smell like that but I actually
like it smells very fresh it kind of
smells like when you pull your clothes
out of the dryer this smells like died
to me very classy like 30 year old guy
almost almost a little bit preppy when I
was in Bath and Body Works I went on my
shop Euler app and which I mentioned in
my how to say money shopping video which
I will link right here I'm obsessed with
this app I open it every time in a store
now if I opened up the app and there was
a coupon on there that had any signature
item for free so I picked up this body
cream this is the wild Madagascar
vanilla
it smells so good I guess this is brand
new the scent and I think they're making
everything like a candle the whole
entire line kind of smells like the moon
midnight Twilight or whatever it's
called moonlit path one of those linger
is really nicely throughout the day I
put it on this morning and still kind of
smell it on me right now alright so next
we have some clothes for fall I was
walking past JCPenney and decide you go
in there just because there was the
Sephora in their makeup addict and I
ended up getting two things surprisingly
the first is this sweater and it's just
black and white striped and it's super
soft this is by the brand Worthington
but a size bigger than what I would
normally wear just because I like the
look of really baggy sweaters and
thought this would look cute with like a
gold chunky necklace or something like
that next I got this thing which is kind
of a hideous yellow color but I'm kind
of obsessed with that it has a faux
leather color right here and then the
sleeves are what do you even call this
it smells like Grandma so it just goes
all the way down like a normal sweater
does but it's short sleeved
it actually looks kind of nice with my
skin which usually like bright orange
and yellow chains make me look like I'm
dead this one somehow works then I went
into Nordstrom Rack I'm having this
moment right now where I don't even
remember going into Norcia breath I
think I blacked out this entire
Nordstrom Rack experience this was like
last week two moments when you know
you're sleep-deprived I got this sweater
is one of those just really slouchy what
do you even call these I don't know if I
will print kind of thing it's super
comfy and super slouchy and I don't have
a sweater like this they usually want to
try them on they're just way too long
for me but down to my knees and I feel
like I'm wearing a dress next we have
H&amp;amp;M I realize this is a very long haul
but I've done a lot of shopping oh one
last thing from Sephora I got a sample
of the soft ivory Laura Mercier what is
that called the silk creme foundation I
went sick and I might use it in a shadow
in schmooze let me know so I went to H&amp;amp;M
and I got a few things I had this weird
obsession with polka-dots lately
hence the iPhone case so I got this
blouse from H&amp;amp;M and this just super
sheer and flowy but it fits really cute
it was kind of pricey this was $30 but I
figured it's a good work shirt and I
really needed more shirts that I can
wear to work so I went ahead and I said
let's do it then I got this white blouse
I just fits perfectly and it has these
really cute kind of I don't know like
the tee looking buttons beeps a
three-word it's just a super flattering
fit and I have it in a couple other
colors so when I saw it on clearance
this is on clearance by the way I didn't
say that
for $10 is normally 18 a
to get it does have someone else's
foundation down the side but not
something that a little bleach can't
handle last thing I got is this bra
which is from H&amp;amp;M and it is so cute it's
mint green and I like it because usually
with these belknap bras they make them
so they're removable straps and I keep
feeling that on the inside
this one has sewn in strap so you ain't
going anywhere
it was $18 such a super reasonable for
bra so that is everything feeling like I
need to work more this week so let me
know down below if you guys want reviews
on any of the products that I'm why is
my tongue like not up to speed with my
brain right now
so if you liked this video and you want
more haul videos give it a thumbs up so
I know love you guys thanks for watching
see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
