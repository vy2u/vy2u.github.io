money in Sephora alright so today we
have a freaking giant Beauty hole so I
have a few videos that I've been trying
to buy products and test out products
for which is kind of what started this
whole haul and then I just kind of
exponentially grew and then this
happened so place a giant order on Ulta
Sephora and BH Cosmetics every time I
shop online I use a base you can get
cash back this isn't sponsored by Ebates
but I love using Ebates it's like a
no-brainer you get cash back every
single time you shop online I just put
it directly in your PayPal or they'll
send you like a check in the actual mail
but it's the easiest thing ever and it's
free money so you should do it have a
link down below for eBay so you can get
a free ten dollar gift card if you're
just signing up right now but let's get
into the hall so I think I'm gonna do
alte first just because this is the
biggest box right here so I had a friend
from real life tell me that the Shea
Moisture masks are awesome for damaged
hair so I picked up this one I'm not
sure which one he was referring to but
this is the Jamaican black castor oil
strengthen grow and restore treatment
mask it has shea butter peppermint and
keratin in it guys my drugstore masks
have been doing wonders for my hair so
much more than some of the high-end
stuff I bought I love the L'Oreal and
I've shown on snapchat and like the bold
little tub and then the Garnier damage
racer both of those have been amazing so
I'm just like feeling the drugstore hair
masks right now oh yeah it smells like a
body butter okay this literally smells
like cake batter body butter pretty sure
when I bought this stuff on Ulta they
were having like a buy one get one free
or half off Shea Moisture so I picked up
these wipes these are african black soap
clarifying facial wipes and these are
brand new I've never seen these it says
for oily blemish prone skin and I do use
the african black soap in the shower
that's kind of like my shower face
washed and I love the way that it makes
my skin feel I have use these a few
times and I personally love the scent of
black soap I know a lot of people don't
has a very distinct smell it's kind of
like licorice and cotton candy
that's what it smells like to me pretty
much the whole reason why I started this
whole shopping spree in the first place
was because I'm going to be doing a
video on the best pale pale new
six I haven't been able to find anything
for pale-skinned that's like super pale
newts and I feel like it's gonna come
back this year I have a feeling I've
been super into them personally so I've
just been trying to bunch of them out so
that's kind of what started this whole
thing so I ended up picking up the NYX
lingerie in satin ribbon I have
embellishment and I have lace detail I
haven't tried this one yet it's still
fully sealed but this one looks the
lightest a lot of the NYX lingerie lipid
lipsticks look super pale on medium skin
tones but on my skin tone they look like
straight-up brown or purple like a
darker nude so it is really tricky
trying to find super super light
products so then I saw this which I'm
pretty sure I hide back in the day but I
can't find it this is the NYX macaron
lippy in the white shade and I don't
know why I never thought of this before
but ladies and gents why don't we mix
our lipsticks with white just like we do
with foundation or concealer or anything
else I don't know why I've never been
doing that so I got this and then I just
started this whole white lipstick search
ended up finding out that Maybelline it
recently came out with one it's wickedly
white I have used this hence why there's
like lipstick on there I don't like the
formula of this Maybelline one too much
it kind of just like smears around your
lip product I feel like it doesn't
deposit a ton of pigment I haven't tried
this NYX one yet but I have tried one
that I got from Sephora which I'll talk
about in a second NYX was something on
sale if I won't get one free or buy one
get one half off so I ended up picking
up a couple other things I picked up
this NYX eyeshadow base in white and
it's just a totally white eyeshadow base
kind of like a Mac Paint Pot the
consistency of it and I used to use the
NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk all the
time to prime my eyes and I don't have a
good white base right now so got this to
try out also got two of their baked
blushes I don't know why don't ask me
why I got these this one looks freaking
gorgeous it's like this mauve shimmery
shade and then this one is more on the
peach side I've kind of been
transitioning out of the pink blushes
and more into peachy shades or like just
using bronzer today I only have bronze
around my cheeks this mod one is in the
shades shift chiffon and then this
peachy one is in the shade
sugar mama then I got this NYX control
freak eyebrow gel since I recently got
my eyebrows permanent tattooed micro
bladed unless I'm like filming a video
or wearing a ton of makeup for the most
part I haven't been filling in my brows
at all on a daily basis I am wearing
product right now but anyways when I put
my foundation on sometimes it covers the
brows a little bit and I need to just go
in with like a makeup remover and a
q-tip but I also got this because this
is just a clear brow gel just to kind of
get the foundation off and like make the
color super visible again tart shape
tape concealer I have tried this a few
times so far I actually did a first
impression on this in the Anastasia
Beverly Hills stick foundation video and
ever since that video I've been wearing
this every single day I'm wearing it
right now
I haven't been setting my under eyes at
all it stays completely creaseless the
entire day it feels like I don't have
anything on under there it feels
extremely lightweight and thin the
formula of this is a lot thinner than
the Urban Decay Naked I think this would
work for spot concealing and it's
amazing for under the eyes you get a
 ton of product in here you get
twice the amount as Urban Decay Naked so
I've been really liking this I got this
white Maybelline cover stick concealer
this is totally white since white
concealers are like a thing now I kind
of want to see how this compares to the
Kat Von D ones I want to try this out
this has been out for forever I don't
know why I've never tried this so I got
a few essence products and I pretty sure
they were by only going half off - this
is their liquid lipstick is called and
I've tried this one time this is in the
shade 0-3 almost real this is not a
liquid lipstick at all this is totally
just a pigmented lip gloss I don't even
know why they call this a liquid
lipstick kinda reminds me of the NYX
butter glosses these I love this is the
essence XXXL shine lip gloss these are
some of my favorite lip glosses this was
in the shade nude candy light peachy
kind of nude right there they do have a
interesting scent straight-up candy
mixed with grape cough medicine yeah not
a fan of it I have raved about the
essence i shadow snowflake and apricot
as a highlight and I wanted to try
Grammy
as glammy 19 this one is more of a
almost silvery with a little bit of like
champagne in it can you guys see that I
can't even see that there this has a
little bit more champagne silvery tone
to it this is the essence tip liner
waterproof I did try this I didn't like
this first of all it's freaking hard to
get this tip out the tip of this is so
bizarre
it's literally like huge I don't know I
don't know it's like felt-tip and it
doesn't have an actual point at the end
it just kind of looks like it should be
a marker got a replacement for my
essence 11 in the nude lip liner I love
essence lip liners so I guess we'll do
Sephora and then BH Cosmetics but first
one thing that I picked up at Nordstrom
online this is the la prairie cell
cellular billion volts cellular cellular
treatment powder foundation people have
been raving about this it is
ridiculously expensive I can't believe I
actually bought this main reason I got
this was to try out for foundation
Friday so we shall see this will be
coming up it's supposed to be like a
super full coverage powder and people
that I've seen do videos on it so far
have pretty great skin I really want to
test it out and see if it covers acne
and not great skin so only did a few
things at Sephora but one of them I've
been loving this is the Olay Henriksen
invigorating night treatment overnight
resurfacer and this is an aah a I'm
using this for about two weeks now every
single night and I feel like my skin
really likes it my skin looks healthier
I don't know if it's this that's been
clearing on my skin I also changed
primers but I just feel like you know
when you put products on your face and
you can kind of tell if your skin likes
it or it just feels like it's breaking
you out this I think my skin really
likes and one of you guys actually
recommended this in the comments of the
video so thank you I think she worked at
Sephora and she said this was like one
of their top selling products for acne
so so far liking this I'll keep you guys
updated this is the product that I was
talking about the white lipstick this is
from bite Beauty and
is in the shade Blanc I didn't even know
this existed I super randomly found this
from this one I love roll-up and it's a
white lip product that you can put on
top of anything this one just has a lot
more pigment it's creamy and it looks
great applied on top of anything if you
don't want to get the lipstick on this
white you can just apply it to your hand
and then like use your finger and kind
of tap it on just to lighten it a little
bit I'm excited about this when I heard
Kat Von D came out with a white
concealer you know I had to get on that
this is the Lockett tattoo concealer and
it's a pure white shade in the shade
whiteout I've used this one time so far
and it lightened it I don't know how I
feel about the actual formula yet
because I feel like I haven't used it
enough but I love the packaging of this
I picked up this amazing cosmetics
concealer in the shade fair and this is
just the travel size I think I've used
this one time with ant the hugest fan of
the formula but this is one of those
ones that I will try out again I am
excited to announce slash slightly
regretful from now vib Rouge which
basically means you spent a ton of
money in Sephora but one of my perk
things was this Stila kit this is the
backstage best set and the reason why I
got this is because it has their wood
liner which I've been meaning to try for
forever I've heard good things about
this liquid liner it also has the liquid
lipsticks I love their stay all day
liquid lipsticks one of my favorite
liquid lipstick formulas and then I
think it also has kitten I don't know
goodness let's do that look at how cute
this is it's like Baby X is in the shade
fiery out oh
I think you actually own this and you
get their huge mascaras out school steal
a huge extreme lash kitten heck yeah
well kitten eyeshadow and a mini liquid
liner alright we're getting to the end
folks BH Cosmetics the reason why I went
on there in the first place was because
I wanted you to try out one of their
liquid lipsticks because it looked like
it was a pretty light nude shade from
swatches that I saw online but now that
I have it on me it's not super light
it's a shade sorbet and it's more of
like a peachy pink shade right there I
don't know if I would wear it's kind of
like too bold pink for me when I ordered
that I ordered
a bunch of other stuff was already on
there I got three of their liquid
lipsticks BH Cosmetics pretty much puts
everything on sale at some point so
don't ever buy anything full price on
there but these were on sale for like
850 when I got them I've worn the shade
lust which I posted a picture on
Instagram wearing this these freakin
rock they stay on all day they're not
super drying just a really nice liquid
lipstick formula and I kind of want to
buy like every other shade now this is
in the shade Glory which looks kind of
like a Christmasy holiday kind of red I
feel like I want a constant hunt for
good affordable sponges so I wanted to
try out the BH Cosmetics Beauty sponge
Pro so far nothing has been my Real
Techniques sponge I know what this
material is but some of the sponges I've
tried have this where it feels like it
doesn't feel like a sponge that other
material then I also heard this is the
super light nude this is their pop art
lipstick in the shades ink and I've
heard really good things about these
lipsticks I've never tried them but the
formula is supposed to be great and this
one actually looks pretty light so I'm
excited about that
there's ink right there I think this was
like under five dollars I got one of
their brushes I don't think I've ever
tried the BH Cosmetics brushes this is
vegan it's the v3 vegan contour brush
have you use it yet but it feels really
nice and soft
oops just got liquid lipstick on it I
still haven't found a bronzer that I
love I'm constantly trying new ones and
I'm constantly not that excited about
them this is their beige satin bronzer
and this isn't a shade tranquil tan I
tried this the other day and it's just
too dark for me and a little bit too
oranjee on the skin actually like the
one I'm wearing today but it's not what
I usually go for it what I'm wearing
today is the hourglass luminous bronze
light
this one's just quite a bit warmer I'll
give this one another go and I love the
packaging tried out the waterproof gel
liner I've been on a gel liner kick
lately
ever since I started using the English
eyeliner that one is beautiful when I
first apply it it's like the blackest
black it goes on super smooth but after
about 10 minutes it creases on me I've
tried
setting it with an eye shadow I've tried
everything to just transfers to my lid
so I've been on the hunt for a good
black gel liner that's as black as that
one
this VH studio when I tried the other
day and this one is just not even close
to as black as the Inglot one this I
really like this I've used a couple
times since I got it
this is the BH modern mattes 28 color
eyeshadow palette these are really
pigmented really soft mattes
and I think this is like 9 bucks or
something I'm gonna swatch a few of them
so there's the pigmentation super soft
alright so that was everything I'm
excited to finally put this stuff away
if you guys liked this video and you
want to see more hauls make sure you
give this a thumbs up I don't think I've
actually announced this on YouTube I
just realized but every Monday Wednesday
Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time is pretty
much when I'm uploading now I never
really like to have a set schedule other
than foundation Friday because sometimes
work and life happens but for the most
part that's pretty much when you can be
expecting videos for me so three times a
week 6 p.m. Pacific time 9:00 p.m.
Eastern Time
if you need some help in that department
love you guys thanks for watching see
you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
