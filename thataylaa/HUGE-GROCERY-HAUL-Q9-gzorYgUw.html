Iceland Norway trip and I just did a
giant grocery grocery grocery run words
what is English and got a ton of stuff
I've never done a grocery haul before so
I figured it would be fun whenever I
post like food-related things on
snapchat I always get a bunch of
questions about what I eat and just
request to do a grocery haul I have like
a couple huge things in a couple weeks I
have Kendall's wedding my cousin's
graduation which is in like a warm place
so I'm just trying to eat healthy for
the next couple weeks and I'm gonna be
doing Jillian Michaels I'm not like a
big dieter or anything I just try and
put healthy things in my body which is
sometimes challenging with work
basically with two jobs I have like no
time to cook so slow cooker recipes on
my best friend and let's just get into
the whole i also wanted to pop in super
quick to let you guys know that this
tuesday i'm going to be doing a live
collab with three of my favorite ladies
here there's also gonna be a two hundred
dollar Sephora giveaway so head 2-stroke
got me a slash Sterba thon they also
just got an app so you can download that
and find the page there it's going to be
super fun everyone has 30 minutes to do
some kind of crazy challenge things so
go to the page to subscribe to be
notified when everyone's live and I will
see you baby toes there so here's all
the food I'm going to show you guys
watch them go through this pretty quick
and show you guys what I eat so starting
with breakfast I'm trying to get some
healthier options I usually eat avocado
toast every single day pretty much in
some form of egg but I want something
quick when I go to work I'm really bad
and I usually end up getting something
from like Starbucks in the morning so
I'm trying to bring healthier stuff to
work I don't like eating breakfast right
when I wake up I usually have coffee at
home and then I go to work and get
something around like 10 so I'm gonna
try out this oatmeal this is apples with
cinnamon I'm not a huge fan of oatmeal
but if it has like a ton of cinnamon in
it we're usually good this has six
packets no artificial colors or
preservatives blah blah got some natural
pepper jack cheese slices I get this
mostly for wraps I like to make like
turkey wraps with tortillas so that's
what the cheese is for fat-free
jeez this is really good to eat with
tomatoes or just I like to eat it with
carrots actually and it's pretty filling
and I love the taste of cottage cheese
speaking of cheese well I got a lot of
cheese this bad boy is my favorite
cheese of all time
this is not like low anything or healthy
by any means but the creamy Swiss
original from laughing cow is amazing
when I make my avocado toast which I get
a ton of questions about on snapchat I
just use usually sourdough bread a
little thing wedge of this cheese and
then avocado obviously I never tried
this tribe humus thought I'd give it a
go
it's gluten free I didn't know there was
normally gluten and hummus but
apparently there is then I got some
yogurt also for breakfast or just snacks
this is Greek yogurt I really like Greek
yogurt it's just a lot thicker and I
just got raspberry vanilla or plain and
then blue berry and this is also for Zee
breakfast also I'm filming this on my
Sony new sony a 5100 camera let me know
what you guys think this is like my
vlogging camera now this is what I
brought on my trip then we have what is
this garlic which my whole freakin car
smells like garlic now so this is a
whole peeled garlic and I just like this
because I won hate peeling garlic and -
it comes in these little vacuum packed
bags so I feel like it'll keep it fresh
for a while and this is the ton of
garlic but I usually cook with a ton of
garlic so perfect I got three avocados
there's the third and then I'm trying
out this bread I haven't tried this
before this is the Dave's killer bread
organic 21 whole grains and seeds has
three M's of protein 60 calories per
slice and 12 grams of whole grains so a
lot healthier than the sourdough bread I
freaking love the taste of sourdough
though so I got these sourdough English
muffins to try I don't know probably
gonna be switching between these then I
got some bananas which they didn't have
any yellow bananas don't you hate that
you got two things of fruit
mostly again to take to work with me I
do not eat fruit unless it's like cut up
like this which is really bad I know
because it's you're like paying way more
for what it is like this thing I think
was $2.99 which is ridiculous like you
can buy a whole cantaloupe for
than that but do anything fast like this
it's just worth it to me to get fresh
ground turkey 93 percent lean and I'm
gonna be doing a crock-pot recipe today
actually because I'm working from home
today it's like a taco bowl recipe to
love crock box you literally just plop
in all the ingredients so one of the
ingredients is the ground turkey then we
have three apples I like to eat these
with peanut butter or just by themselves
and I have a lime and the lemon I
couldn't remember if I needed this for
the crock-pot so I just got some anyways
this is part of the crock-pot recipe
taco seasoning whoo I got a breath same
with this this is just diced tomatoes
with green chili then I got some corn
just because then some refried beans
again I just always like to have beans
then I have kosher dill pickles I love
pickles I could eat this whole jar in
one sitting I have two of these vegan
ramen it's basically like ramen but
vegan haven't tried this before but
looks promising I got two things that
peanut butter cuz it's buy one get one
free so I got one chunky
crunching peanut butter this is again
the open nature brand and then one
creamy peanut butter and I am like
eating healthier than I usually do I
like to get chocolate chips because I'm
actually not a huge fan of chocolate but
it really satisfies my sweet tooth
whenever I'm having a sweet craving I'll
literally eat like five or ten chocolate
chips and I'm like totally satisfied I
got these lightly salted rice cakes I
like to put peanut butter on these or
tuna as like a lunch and here's the tuna
again this open nature brand chunk light
tuna in water
I got salmon to make this is just super
easy just wrap it in foil and put some
lemon and butter and then cook it in the
oven so four wraps I'm trying out these
tortillas usually has 70 calories Porter
per tortilla and five grams of protein
which is I think pretty good for
tortillas high fiber low carb they
looked fine so we'll try them moving
over here I got some peeled carrots I
like to dip that in hummus some spinach
I like to put this in smoothies or my
juicer I didn't get all the stuff for
juicing this time but I'll probably just
be making
green smoothies celery because I think
the crock-pot recipe called for celery
or why do I get celery I don't you
remember now something I was doing
culture celery and then some kale I like
to bake kale chips or just make like a
salad and put some kale in it actually
really like the taste of kale which is a
recent finding for me 3 bell peppers
this is for the crock pot recipe to
zucchini also for the crock pot recipe
onion crock pot and then cilantro fun
going over here I just got storage
containers whenever I make a crock pot
recipe I have like tons of leftovers
that I put in the freezer and I have
meals for like weeks so I just got that
because I couldn't remember if we had
enough containers I typically drink 1%
low-fat milk so this is what I got and
then I love orange juice I know it's not
the best for you there's like a ton of
sugar in it but I just feel like
breakfast isn't complete without orange
juice so I'm cooking spray because you
ran out this is just nonstick canola oil
cooking spray from the pan and then I've
never tried this the kind of green juice
you buy is not nearly as good as the
kind that you can make at home like I
put way more veggies than what's in this
can and they're usually typically super
high in sugar this one is it has 53
grams so I wouldn't drink this whole
thing at one time probably then I love
sparkling water for me I need to like
something carbonated when I eat a meal I
just think it makes the taste so much
better instead of getting soda
I get sparkling water one regular and
then one lemon so this is everything so
if you guys like this video and you want
to see more grocery hauls give it a
thumbs up I usually switch between the
Safeway and Trader Joe's so this was
obviously a Safeway if you guys want to
see a Trader Joe's haul next give this
