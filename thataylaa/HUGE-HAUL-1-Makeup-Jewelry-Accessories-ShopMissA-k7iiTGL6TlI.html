with their children right now which they
seem to frequently do sorry being here
that actually kind of want you to hear
it it's pretty amazing I just got home
from work it was in the filming mood so
we're doing this by the way side note
I've been kind of obsessed with this
foundation combination this is the Estee
Lauder Double Wear mixed in with the
Revlon Colorstay these two are freaking
amazing
I have it on right now I didn't powder
or anything this morning this is after
like ten hours of work and my face still
looks pretty damn good alright so today
I'm gonna do like a unboxing haul kind
of video I got some stuff from shop
Missa calm and it's bundled quite
heavily do I have enough scissors the
chocolates that basically has dollar
jewelry and cosmetics and accessories
and a ton of false eyelashes I'm
pretty sure everything is a dollar I saw
a few things on there that were like a
dollar fifty but for the most part
everything's a dollar we're super zoomed
in right now because I wanted you guys
to be able to see me the jewelry this is
work I don't even know where to start
and so excited so I got a bunch of
jewelry got a bunch of makeup and
eyelashes and hair stuff and everything
was under $1 obviously this isn't going
to be like super high quality sterling
silver jewelry is more of this if you
want some fashion jewelry or whatever
all right I'm just gonna start off with
hair stuff cuz they're kind of right on
the top these are freaking adorable
first is this polka dot twisted hair
wrap I love these things especially for
when you're like getting ready and you
can just put your hair out of your face
this one has white hearts on it
it is adorable I also got a blue polka
dot one because why not I thought these
would look really cute with like red
lipstick and like hair down curled and
stuff I don't know that's how I picture
it next I got this bow thing which I
think was technically supposed to be a
kid's bow it has cupcakes on it and you
can't say no to mend things with
cupcakes on it I think I'm gonna use it
for something with my Erin Condren
planner if you guys follow my Instagram
and I posted two videos on YouTube about
my planner I'm kind of addicted to
planner decorating it's a bad addiction
let me know down below if you guys want
a whole other another video unlike
planner things I've had a lot of
questions on Instagram but not really on
YouTube though let me know so I got an
elf eyelash curler they had some elf
stuff on there and which was obviously
like this is the same price as an elf
but whatever I don't actually own an
eyelash curler which I feel like is kind
of strange I just never feel the need to
curl my eyelashes I feel like it's an
extra step that I just won't do but I
figured you might as well try it right
then I have two pairs of earrings I
really like these ones these are like
gold leafy black diamond D things these
look really pretty in Italy
most of the earrings I'm showing they
had in like 10 different colors so if
you don't like black and gold they have
the entire rainbow basically just try
these on I usually go for a super simple
jewelry they're like black and silver
black and gold I don't really like
colors and I just like basic things that
I can wear with like any outfit who I
really like those maybe we'll just keep
this earring out just to me might try on
here then I got these bow earrings with
like giant ass pearls on them hell yeah
hell yeah whatever lipstick I've thrown
today it's kind of feathering the day
when I can afford an autofocus camera
like my entire world will be changed
okay then I have a ton of eyelashes
I got 1 2 3 4 5 but I think there might
be
here somewhere what Brando it looks like
these are all Kara a hundred percent
human hair eyelashes
does that sound not appealing to anyone
else I feel like that's supposed to
sound like a good thing I kind of always
go for a similar eyelash styles I like
really separated lashes that give me
like kind of doll like lashes these kind
of look like the demi wispies which I
don't usually like so I don't know these
are number 48 then I got number 62 which
are very spidery and look like they're
gonna be nice dull ones these are number
99 they look like nice separated but
natural or s4y feel like I'm gonna like
these I like how these are kind of
tapered and they're smaller in the front
and then they get wider towards the
outside oh I got two pairs of those
these are just white and diamond pair of
little rose earrings I guess they're not
little they're pretty big I remember
they had these ones in a bunch of
different colors Oh found another
eyelash user number SF 66 not much to
say about these these look pretty short
these are brother brands star now watch
so different brand than the other ones
couple necklaces here so this is like a
gold I don't even know I'm not gonna try
and describe this because you're looking
right at it this looks really pretty and
I'm kind of stoked about this one
and there's this I would okay I'll pinch
it over and there's this one which is a
nice like circle choker kind of necklace
this kind of looks like little coins or
something I really like the hammered
metal look it's what migraine which ring
this ring is what my ring is that I wear
every day this like metal chain necklace
this one looks like it's a little bit
longer than the other ones I wanted just
like a simple silver necklace that I
could wear with anything
this one actually feels pretty nice and
heavy then I got a polka dot makeup bag
because you can never go wrong with
polka dots I won't use this for makeup I
don't really carry around makeup in my
purse by the way let me know if you guys
want to see what's in my bag video I've
never done one of those ever and I'm
kind of feeling it okay so I am super
super stoked about these they have the
gold like flash tattoos on there they're
obviously not the same brand but I've
been wanting in try these ever since I
saw them on Instagram they had a ton of
different
the signs of these if you haven't seen
these they're basically just gold and
silver tattoos and they look really
awesome on I don't think I'll be putting
like metallic ass gold stars on my body
but I really like these kind of triangle
geometric shape ones two of those I also
got oh just kidding I got three of those
it's what it looks like it's for your
hands they're a lot smaller got some
makeups so they have a lot of clean
color clean color I never know how to
say that brand which is kind of like you
like I see that on a lot of sites online
I don't think I've actually tried any of
their products before this packaging
though looks like it's from Dollar Tree
they probably have this at Dollar Tree
it's called American Idol has broadly
way Jamie's I thought this was a mint
color it looked whoa this is actually
super pigmented looks like it's the
exact same like minty color it's my
background which a lot of you guys liked
and a few of you didn't like so I'm
gonna go with the majority gotta love
democracy this actually it looks really
pretty and swatched really well so this
looks like it's a it's in the shade
mahogany I think this was a loose powder
bronzer this looks really really dark I
will not be using this I might use it as
an eyeshadow
not if you're pale princess oh good I
got another one of the eyeshadows so
this is their baked shadow wet dry
probably shoulda said that there is no
color on here it's just the white
shimmery one this one's a little bit
chalky yeah this definitely no I don't
like this one we have one last little
bundle stuff looks like I got one of
their blushes it's the mist chick blush
interesting packaging looks like a half
a like half orange looks really
pigmented that's it's watched on the
hand looks like it'll be a nice peachy
color I'm excited to try this thing ooh
that sounded so satisfying this is
really interesting packaging what is
this thing this is the Kajal eyeliner
look at this look at this little comb
thing they have going on I like to use
my eyeliner on my waterline I'm wearing
it
right now kind of wish I wasn't though
so I wanna try it out it all food this
in its shadow my schmooze there's
something clean color everlasting
lipsticks this is in the shade earth and
earth just flew out this is Earth okay
I'm trying to push it back in there
let's swatch earth actually looks pretty
nice
smells like dollar lipstick last kind of
makeup the item is this clean color
cocoa what does that say egg bomb bomb
this is the minty one I cannot put
anything not minting on my lips like
chopstick wise I can't do the flavor a

I just can't do it I really like the
packaging of this reminds me of the EOS
lip-balm
this thing's pretty tiny oh yeah these
are actually really cute okay I'm really
feeling these I think these are gorgeous
watching you do it I got to take this
off by a DD and I really like these
these are like right up my alley
here's another pro one it looks like
they're little gold bows with pearls
these are interesting I don't know how I
feel about this shape imagine like a
wind meal I think they could be cute
they're pretty big and we have these
hoops which I am super stoked about
they're just bold hoops with little
black jewels I remember they had these
ones and a bunch of different colors
these I think are the exact same as like
the first earrings I showed except they
have black and white on the bows like
these my only item of color are these
earrings I really like this orange and I
feel like with black hair orange kind of
just pops like these will be good like
summer earrings the last things I got
we're tattoos you had a really awesome
big tattoos on here I really like this
one
this flower black and white white and
then this says in the head and heart in
the head there we go so that was
everything that I got at shop Missa for
being a dollar I feel like they had
really really cute stuff if you guys
