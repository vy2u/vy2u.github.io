haul I can't even hold the bags up right
now because there's too many I'm pretty
sure I could fit in this Ross bag yeah
so I know I'm wearing the Marc Jacobs
remarkable foundation right now this is
the first time I'm wearing it let me
know down below if you guys want to see
a full review on this I just posted the
swatch of the lightest shade compared to
the Kat Von D l42 foundation that's on
instagram if you want to see it my
Instagram is the Taylor same as
everything else except snapchat so I
went to Ross Ulta and Target I think
we're gonna start with Volta I am amazed
that the ladies fit all my in this
tiny ass bag wow this is like the Mary
Poppins bag right here my best friend's
mom was way too kind and gave me an OL
tag if card for the holidays Marie if
you're watching this I love you you
didn't need to do that so I got a ton of
stuff unexpectedly I actually went there
because I did need one thing I picked up
my Holy Grail concealer this is the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer in the
shade fair neutral it's pale enough you
have light skin when mine ran out I
didn't repurchase it because I have 20
concealers that I wanted to finish up
and I've gone through a couple of them
so I feel like I can reward myself by
going back to this there's just nothing
like this sometimes I like to take a
break from products and see if it was
actually that good you know I'm saying
that you miss it best full coverage
concealer it's creamy if you haven't
tried it out it's honestly worth the $28
it is amazing I picked up these because
I heard someone talking about this now
remember who was I think someone
mentioned these in a vlog I watch like
20 people on vlogmas arm you know who
says what at this point this is the skin
Iceland
hydro cool firming eye gel so it only
comes with four pairs and it was like
$15 a little bit on the pricey side I
feel like but you basically put these
under your eyes it's supposed to like
moisturize underneath your eyes and I've
been having weird issues with my
concealer under there where it just
looks super dried not cute so we'll try
these out got this Freeman mask mint and
lemon clay mask it smells so good and
this is supposed to control oil and
breakout it says it's a cooling mask
which I love yeah I haven't actually
tried any of the Freeman masks that I've
heard these are really good drugstore or
affordable mess this is like four
dollars this is a brand that I've never
heard of before it's to be and they have
it on an end display thing I think it's
either a Belgian or
Italian brand I said made in Italy and
made in Belgium they're running now that
happens but this is a blush and it's in
the shade pop zero one just a really
pretty pale peachy kind of pink color I
think this was like $7.99 so ultra brand
was buy two get two free and I was
originally looking at this this is the
matte primer does an oil-free mattifying
primer this has salicylic acid in it
which is what sold me my skin reacts
really well Giselle silk acid I love
when there is salicylic acid in primers
because I feel like it's actually
helping instead of hurting my skin then
I got the old tech color correcting
foundation and primary stick I don't
know why this appealed to me I haven't
heard anyone talk about it let me know
if you guys have want to see like a
first impression review on this there's
a color correcting green shade in there
which I thought was interesting so then
the two products that I got for free
from purchasing those I chose the Beauty
smoothie buttercream cupcake how
appetizing does that sound it's this
three-in-one shower gel shampoo bubble
bath I would never use this for shampoo
I would just use it for shower gel but
it smells heavenly yeah it smells like
straight-up cupcake batter I like that
this has a pump on it Arianne out of my
exfoliator for the shower so this is the
coconut and almond milk
this has aloe shea butter green tea and
vitamins it's just an exfoliating scrub
I like to use this before I shave my
legs just helps to get all the dead skin
off and this kind of smells like
sunscreen actually a mix of sunscreen
and cupcakes it's the last couple things
from Ulta I got the Mario Badescu drying
lotion I usually use their what is it
called it's similar to the drying lotion
but it's not the same I've never
actually tried this but people love this
for acne and I need to get this thing
under control so I'm gonna try this out
basically just dip a q-tip in put it on
your acne and then let it dry overnight
last thing I got is the NYX HD finishing
powder this is just a translucent
finishing powder I liked it as pressed I
have this in the loose powder version
and there's something about loose
setting powders I just really don't like
I feel like it breaks up my foundation
and looks kind of patchy I don't know is
that just me but this looks really nice
it feels super soft when I swash it in
the store and I think this is like nine
dollars somewhere on there alright so I
just got a couple things at Target the
first thing which I'm super friggin
excited about are these boots or we may
actually came back with these last night
and I went to Target today and I bought
the same exact one
I love these because I have the gold
zipper and their pointed toes my other
boots like this are round toe and I
actually spill bleach on them in the
move so that's how many ones I'm usually
a size four but in these boots I can
just wear like thick socks and make it
work next thing I got is this flannel
jacket which was on sale for $10 and I
can't tell if it's super hideous or
could be cute but I actually really like
this emerald green color just super soft
and it zip up and it's just like a
casual throw on with yoga pants kind of
situation is this cute or ugly let me
know what you think down below last
thing I got at Target is a backup of my
Neutrogena oil-free acne stress control
toner this is like one of my holy grail
face products I've mentioned this 20
different times before alright so moving
on to Ross I have a huge ass bag down
here I got a lot of presents so I'm not
sure if I'm gonna show those I don't
know who watches these videos but I got
two things and gift bags which is really
exciting
look at how freakin pretty these are
here's the first one and then they're
just says Merry Christmas
these were $2.99 for all three this is
what these look like how cute is this
and then this one says hohoho my room is
literally covered in red glitter to go
with the black and gold theme we have
tissue paper a tissue paper super
exciting let's go in off the color feel
if I turn blue I'm actually doing a
super exciting collab video and it has
to do with Ross so I got a ton of stuff
for that video so I'm not gonna show any
of it but I probably got like 5 or 10
things for that video so we'll just put
you over here I got a ton of socks this
is a 6 pack of socks and this was $5.99
because where the do socks go
actually I feel like they literally just
disappear off planet Earth got a Monster
High doll for my cousin we did some
starbucks hot cocoa mix this was $6.99
and I'll probably give this to my aunt
as one of her Christmas presents I think
she watches my videos so we're good got
this candle winter gala cedar wood and
sage and this is smells exactly like a
toned down version of mahogany teak wood
or sparkling icicles from Bath and Body
Works it isn't as strong when you
actually light it I've lit this once so
far and it's not super strong like it
smells a lot stronger in the actual tin
whatever this is this was $6.99 normally
$14 I do not need
more candles I still candles from like
two years ago holiday collections this I
am so freakin excited about this is a
brush that looks exactly like the Real
Techniques bold metals collection except
it's $4.99 let's open this and see if
it's soft this is by the brand beauty
muse Pro I wish they had other brushes
that looked like this because someone
needs to make a freaking dupe set of
those Real Techniques brushes I don't
know why those brushes are like 20 or
$30 I think it's absolutely ridiculous
I love how it's like tapered down at the
bottom it feels very light like totally
hollow oh it's actually pretty soft not
like the softest brush I've ever felt
but it's definitely not itchy oh we
could definitely work with this I got
some refills of my Starbucks dark cake
cuts because these are my jam and I've
already opened these then I got a bunch
of clothes I don't know what it is but
my deodorant or detergent or something
has been destroying all of my black tops
so basically all of my basic tops that I
wear like on the weekend are destroyed
so I just picked up some random ones I
love this $6.99 I think all these were
$6.99 this one is super soft this is
another just basic black long-sleeve
slouchy thing that I'll wear with yoga
pants or jeans or whatever and it has
the like American Apparel white
drawstrings
this is $7.99 I don't know why I got
these I just had to these look so
Christmasy and festive and they feel
really nice and uh yeah these leggings
were $5.99 this is just a basic army
green long-sleeve shirt again super soft
super flowy this was $6.99 actually got
a couple colors this is like a total
weekend we're under a sweatshirt kind of
shirt and this is super soft again short
sleeve striped black gray this was $6.99
and then the last thing I got at Ross
was just a super exciting all black
t-shirt with the pocket this was $5.99
all right battery just died but that was
everything we're gonna wrap this up if

thumbs up so I know let me know down

foundation review and if you want more
