can't say no I am so excited right now
it is Sunday I'm in a good mood we're
filming I just hung out with Christy
from Rob UT Christy follow me on
snapchat you saw all of that
and by all that I mean my three snaps
pretty sure when you guys are watching
this I'll be in San Francisco so I'm pre
recording a couple videos so I have
stuff to put up so today we are unboxing
stuff from Korea I haven't really looked
at any of these yet I just took off all
the bubble wrap so we can get that out
of the way yes style.com contacted me to
see if I wanted to try out some of their
stuff and I started looking on their
site and they have tons of cool makeup
they have stuff from Korea Japan Taiwan
really unique stuff that you obviously
can't get here in the US and the cool
thing is that they have free shipping
over $35 so if that's your excuse for
not trying out makeup from other
countries you don't have one whenever
you have stuff from eBay it usually
takes a good month to actually arrive
here they have a section on their
website that ships in 24 hours all the
stuff I got shipped within 24 hours and
I got my order like two days later
literally we're just gonna dig in and
I'm going to show you guys gonna be fun
so the first thing I have here is the
ponds flawless white says ultraluminous
facial foam and this was a face wash
that got really good reviews on their
asian beauty products are really into
whitening like whitening skin care we
all know I don't really need to be any
whiter and rather this could be helpful
with helping with acne scars and just
like lightening your overall complexion
it smells really good and just fresh and
it has this like pearly pink color to it
this was six dollars and ninety cents
good deal drugstore price next I got
this sponge puff it's called this is
basically like a Beauty Blender dupe
let's open this thing up and see well
why should you start you're watering
this is only three dollars and fifty
four cents it looks exactly like this
Beauty Blender I'm excited to see this
out maybe I'll do like a comparison
video what you guys want to see that let
me know I do have a comparison between
Real Techniques and a forever 21 makeup
sponge it feels nice and squishy
that sounds so satisfying but look how I
am BG products always have super cute
packaging like they just make everything
looks so much more appealing there could
be like a piece of poop in here and I
it was cute I got this color my brows
brow gel by etude house I got the shade
rich brown I think it was the only one
that they had in stock this is just a
brow gel and this was 990 did I already
say that I think so let's see the
coloring well this definitely has a
bigger one than my older Brad gel if you
guys won't see any of these in a shadow
in shoes just let me know down below
what is this I don't even remember
a oh this is a face cream I believe a
lot of this is in Korean so says nature
Republic aloe vera soothing gel this is
one another product that got really good
reviews on there this was 1394 this
huge-ass container there is 10.5 fluid
ounces in here so it's freaking huge my
favorite favorite face cream right now
is be nickimja I leave it in the downbar
every video and I think there's like a
coupon code but that is my Holy Grail
face cream for the last leg I want to
say eight months to a year it's almost
out so I'm like on the hunt for a new
face cream this is like whoa trippy
definitely smells like cucumber jelly
formula this would last me like five
years I am so freaking excited to try
this I don't know if you guys saw that
video but like a video went viral on
Facebook of a girl putting on this mask
this is a carbonated bubble clay mask
and you basically put it on and it
starts like bubbling and foaming up on
your face yeah I just fell for that
video ever since that I wanted to try it
this was 1390 and it just comes in a
little this is called container oh heck
yeah I got these lashes these are sweet
eyelash number one and these are like
exactly what I like I love super
separated doll like lashes and they were
656 for this whole thing okay so on my
invoice that it said free gift but this
is really exciting these are mink lashes
and they actually look really pretty
says mink eyelash number 505 um this is
adorable this is the etude house lovely
cookie blush look at this packaging I
think I might about two oh yeah I didn't
get two of these these were each 990 my
biggest pet peeves is peeling off labels
this is so cute ooh
that looks like a super pretty shade of
peach I don't think you would ever apply
a blush with this but this is nice to
have for powder or whatever peach
parfait and then this pink one is in the
shade raspberry
tart I got this etude house proof 10 eye
primer this is just a shadow primer
never had a primer in this kind of
packaging this is very intriguing just a
nice like neutral nude color this was
890 I got the oh my eye line that's all
it says on here and this is a liquid
eyeliner
this was 690 which is really reasonable
for an eyeliner and it looks like it has
a really nice fine point let's see how
black this is oh heck yeah this got
really good reviews as well this is the
etude house drawing eyebrow oh there's a
spoolie on one end
this was 390 by etude house I got the
shade zero six black and this is just a
twist up pencil I think there we go
they had this creamy lip tint mousse
like a liquid lipstick on there I got
the shade three I have no idea what
color this was I think when I was
choosing the colors like they weren't
showing up ooh
that's actually really pretty I think
this is a liquid lipstick I hope this is
like long lasting because so like the
only thing is I actually wear on my lips
but let's swatch this bad boy ooh that
looks super pretty it's like a neon
coral red color
this was 1320 this is what I'm most
excited about
look at this these are animal face masks
like how exciting is that they have
tigers panda bears monkeys you name it
this just was really appealing to me and
I can't wait to put these on my face
this was kind of expensive it was like
22 dollars but you do get seven
different masks I got a bra they do have
clothing and jewelry and other stuff on
there this is one of those stick on bras
but what I liked about this one is that
it's push up it feels nice I don't know
how it works yet but I'll keep you guys
in the loop I'm probably way too excited
about this but this is a eyebrow razor
in the shape of a flamingo this was for
66 and I do use eyebrow razors only on
my eyebrows but on my peach fuzz as well
couldn't resist the Flamingo last thing
I got is this skin food rice mask this
is a wash off face mask and what is in
here special food ingredients for the
skin I think this is like an organic e
right
masks and it got really good reviews I
want to try it oh it smells really good
actually smells like just clean I
thought it's gonna smell like organic
and things but the consistency of this
is really interesting battery just died
again
we're gonna make it through this time if
you guys like this video and you want to
see more haul videos give it a thumbs up

chopping on yes style again they have
