all right it is whole time I feel like I
haven't done a beauty hole in a hot
minute so if you did not know it has
been slash still is the Sephora vib sale
the IB is like one of the most hard
things for me to say it gets you're
right in the bottom of the throat going
on right now I believe it's until the 15
so they'll still be a couple days when
you guys see this video I ordered during
this thing Bruges first access I am NOT
a proud Rouge member that is not an
accomplishment I place my order the
first day that this went up and got 20%
off my whole order leave if you're a vib
but not Rouge
I think it's 15% off through the 15th
it's weird how they don't like publish
it anywhere on their website you have to
read the freaking forum so I save 20%
off my whole order and then I also
stacked it with Ebates
which is basically a site where you can
get cash back I've used Ebates for years
this videos in partnership with them so
thank you to them for collaborating with
me on this video it's always awesome
when you get to work with brands that
you genuinely love those are the only
brands that I do sponsored videos with
Ebates is legit you get cash back either
deposited into your PayPal or you get a
check in the mail basically just type in
whatever site you're shopping on see if
they offer cashback they do for most
sites I think they have like over 2,000
on there they basically have like all
the main retailers for a Ulta Macy's
never online shop I do it on desktop I
don't know why I like can't get down
with mobile shopping comment down below
what you guys do
are you a mobile shopper or a desktop
shopper so I personally type it in shop
that way but they also have a browser
button that just pops up and reminds you
and then they also have a mobile app if
you prefer to shop on your phone so if
we're gonna be shopping the vib sale or
just anytime you shop on sephora or Ulta
definitely use eBay's because it's
literally free money you base is also
doing like a holiday kind of promotion
thing where they're doing double
cashback on certain sites so Charlotte
Russe is double cashback right now J
Crew and there are a few others so
they'll be down below in the description
box if you're new to e base by the way
they give you like a $10 welcome bonus
kind of thing when you spend your first
25 bucks so if you place any kind of
Sephora Ulta order or whatever and do
some shopping for the sale you'll also
get your $10 bonus so I have a link down
below for Ebates right at the top of the
description box where you can check it
out let's get into the hall so I show up
at Sephora for the sale and then all
I picked up a lot of stuff from Ulta I
did two separate Ulta orders because
they had a 20% off kind of thing going
on to which I feel like they usually do
right before Sephora does smart Ulta
smart all right so let's start out with
Sephora since that sale is still
currently going on there vib sales are
really the only time they do sales on
everything like new launches bestsellers
everything is 20% off or 15% off so it
is the time to splurge ladies and
gentlemen it's just the time to buy
yourself a present you deserve it
my present to myself which I definitely
did not need because I have five
thousand billion perfumes at this point
is the pin Rose pillow-talk poet perfume
because I actually got a sample this
with a different Sephora order literally
probably three months ago at least and
I've been holding on to the sample packs
actually still in my bathroom and I kept
it because it was such a unique scent
new at some point I was gonna cave and
get it and I didn't want to forget what
it was called oh that is cute that's
really small look at how small that is
here to the friggin bucks oh my god it
smells so good it is truly unlike any
perfume I've ever smelled I feel like
this is such a unique scent and as I was
reading the reviews for this perfume
almost every review said it's one of
those perfumes that people always ask
about and I could totally see that it
has this really warm in like comforting
cozy scent it almost smells like laundry
it definitely has that clean scent to it
almost smells a little bit like vanilla
or amber to me I would describe this as
like warm vanilla laundry I just could
sniff my arm all day by the way I
actually just filmed a whole video on
this look I'm wearing right now and I
tested out a few of the products I'm
gonna be mentioning so that video will
be coming after this you guys can see
kind of my first impressions on some of
it so I'm just gonna give like a brief
opinion on the ones that I did try
because my full opinion will be coming
in that video but I picked at the ciate
London glow too illuminating blush I
really like blushes that have a little
bit of a sheen not to the point where
they look like a highlighter but
something like the Too Faced pop don't
peach you guys know I like this I'm
wearing this blush right now on top of a
highlight that I don't like it's very
subtle
I really like the shade of this I could
see myself using this as like a really
simple everyday kind of blush to just go
with a bunch of different looks but look
at the packaging
so cute I like how small and like
compact this is I also tried out the
tarte maracuja creaseless concealer in
this video this was in the shade fair
which was the lightest shade I like the
shade of it I like the ton of it you
guys will see what I think of the
formula in that video but I've been
looking for a concealer for drier kind
of under eyes as I've been starting to
get drier I also picked up another
concealer that I have not tried yet this
is the Estee Lauder Double Wear stay in
place fall is concealer this is in the
shade one and extra light and a sailor
tends to run pretty dark so I don't have
high hopes for this shade but all the
reviews for this we're saying that this
was totally underrated so I'm excited to
try that I like an underdog so maybe
I'll try this in a different first
impressions video or I'll use it in a
shadow movies or something if I can wait
that long I'm really excited try that
one this was a recommendation from one
of you guys in the comments I think on a
foundation Friday video this is the
hourglass illusion hyaluronic skin tint
for those of you who don't know I'm
currently on accutane and I've been
using a lot of products with hyaluronic
acid just to help with the dryness I
wanted something that was moisturizing
and dewy but not super heavy someone
recommended this saying it had really
good coverage and was kind of like a
unique formula so I wanted to give it a
go this is in the shade vanilla this is
like a sturdy box here's what the
packaging looks like nice gold squeeze
tube let me know if you guys would want
to see this in a foundation Friday
speaking of being hydrated I picked up
the dr. jart
ceramide in I think that's how you say
it body oil I was looking at different
body oils to help with the dryness
because again my entire body is getting
dry not just my face this one had really
good reviews at a really good price
point you get a shit ton of product in
here you get 8.5 fluid ounces here's
what the bottle looks like I have tried
this twice so far and I really liked it
the thing that has always put me off
from body oils is that I don't want it
to get all over my sheets I don't want
it to get on my clothes I just wanted
something this moisturizing but super
fast absorbing so I don't have to like
sit there and wait for my body to absorb
oil for 10 hours this one says it's
designed for use in the shower or bath
or after the shower batch is like when
your skin is still damp 99% concentrated
a plant-based essential oils
combined with ceramide they're actually
both times I use this I just used it on
dry skin I'm gonna try tonight on damp
skin there's something about putting oil
or like lotion on damp skin that kind of
bothers me because like how do you tell
off afterwards you know I don't know
maybe you wait for your body to just dry
with the oil in it
that's probably what happens it absorbs
very quickly it doesn't feel heavy it's
super super lightweight the scent is a
little bit medicinal which I actually
like it smells like essential oils but
not bad herbal it's not overpowering oil
isn't gonna transfer and it just kind of
like seeps into your skin really nice so
I'm happy with that purchase I'm excited
to keep using it so that's everything I
picked up from Sephora I went kind of
crazy on OLDA though this is the Murad
age reformed hydrodynamic moisturizer
this is with a moisturizer looks like I
mentioned this in the jus a foundation
Friday and I got this off of a
recommendation from Caroline hyerin's
here ins I'm not sure how to say her
last name but she's like a skincare
genius if you want to learn more about
skincare definitely watch her videos
because I went on like a binge the other
night and I feel like I learned so much
in like two hours she's just like a
wealth of knowledge and on her blog you
can also look up specific products to
see kind of her review on it and just
the ingredients and everything this was
one the moisturizers that she
recommended that actually does something
and has good ingredients in it those
hyaluronic acid in it the thing that
sold me on this is that it's thick which
I love I love a good thick face cream
but somehow as soon as you put it on
your face and you blend it into your
skin it becomes so lightweight feeling
and it makes your skin literally feel
like a baby's butt so it's great for
makeup application if you use this
underneath your makeup my foundation
everything goes on fine over top of this
just a basic white cream doesn't have a
scent I'm kind of straying away from
scented products because I've learned
that fragrance is just not something you
want to put on your face if you can
avoid it there's no reason to have
fragrance in a product it is pricey I
think this is like 75 bucks so it's a
total splurge but I feel like especially
in the last year skincare is something
that I'm willing to splurge on if it's
worth it
if there are actually good ingredients
in it just because it's high-end doesn't
mean there are good ingredients in it
something I learned from Caroline so if
you're willing to splurge on this I so
far I think it's worth it I realized I'm
kind of like a little bit bored with the
eyeshadows I have have my few go twos
but I just want to try and branch out
and find different eyeshadow palettes
that I really love and it seems like
these ones were very highly rated this
is the sleek makeup eyeshadow palette
these are drugstore from Ulta under a
spell I got and eat n love the old to
carry sleek makeup now because before it
was kind of hard to get if you're in the
u.s. I want to open one of these up just
to see what the shades look like nice
sleek packaging so here's what these
shades look like my battery's dying
switch batteries we are back in action
so here's what the shades like looks
like what it's like there's some nice
kind of gem tones in there so I picked
up a few pairs of lashes the first ones
are one of my Holy Grail lashes the
bands on these are really thick these
are the I wore one 21s the bands are not
the most comfortable thing but the way
they make your lashes look they look so
bomb they almost have like a cat eye
look to them because they have a more
voluminous outer half than the inner
half have a bunch of videos wearing
these if you type in any name of the
product you want to see plus the Tayla
in the youtube search bar any videos
that I have wearing that will come up
since I list everything in the
description box so if you want to see
what these look like on you can do that
but these are bomb lashes I also picked
up two pairs of Ardell faux mink these
are both eight 11s I just realized that
I think wait did I pick these up because
I really like these yeah I think these
are the ones that I really liked I think
of use these in a video too and I really
liked them they also give you that kind
of cat eye look yeah eight eleven that
was one if you've been watching my
channel for a while you know the makeup
revolution heart highlighter goddess of
love or God does it got all of her faith
that's one of my all-time favorite
highlighters I wanted to try it in a
different shade and they switched up the
packaging looks totally different now
this isn't the shade golden goddess I'm
gonna open this up ooh yeah it's like a
champagne gold I love the packaging of
these and they have the most beautiful
wet kind of Sheen to them if you like
highlighters that look wet ones under 8
bucks and it looks beautiful on the face
okay yeah you can
see that so watching it doesn't do
address this maybe let's layer some on
it obviously haven't tried this shade
yet oh man oh man so pretty it just
gives you that wet look without
emphasizing texture and keep in mind the
highlighter that I had on under here I
did not did not like you guys will see
that in that video so it's gonna look a
little bit more textured right now than
it normally would because it's on top of
that next up is something that I knew is
gonna be a total hit or miss and not
only because this deodorant but also
because it's natural deodorant or
naturally derived deodorant this is the
every man-jack aluminum-free fresh scent
it says and i usually have good luck
better luck with man deodorants than
deodorants for women because they're a
lot stronger they usually just work
better
the only deodorant I found that fully
works on me and that like stays on and
it doesn't stay in my clothes weird
white splotchy things in the wash is the
Old Spice this one smells really good it
smells fresh kind of powdery but this
did not work at all and that's what I
find with the most natural deodorants
especially is that like usually only
people who naturally smell like roses
24/7 can pull off natural deodorants you
know I'm saying that one did not work
out for me so in the past couple months
I have been so into watching zoella and
alfie her boyfriend their vlogs I find
them to be really genuine and just fun
she's kick-ass let me just say like she
has a best-seller
she has a couple of different lines of
merchandise and products and all this
stuff like she's just kicking ass I
wanted to try out a couple of her
products to support her and just try
them out and see how they are so I got
the double cream body cream I love the
packaging on this super cute it's like
pink and white striped and I tried this
for the first time last night and I
actually liked it a lot better than I
thought I was going to not because I
thought it was gonna be a crap product
or anything but I typically I'm not that
into like body lotions I would rather
use something like a vino that's gonna
like really work but this one is
actually very thick and I put this all
over my legs last night it's gonna put
this on my hands right now cuz they're
super dry anyways has this sweet almost
almond scent to it but it's not
overpowering at all it's pretty light it
doesn't smell like something that you
couldn't wear like
you month this is like one of those
sense though that guys would like you
know what I mean if you are in a
relationship or whatever get this lotion
it smells really good but not too
intense and then this one I haven't
tried yet but I just love that concept
of this like a bath latte how freaking
cute is that and this packaging and
everything with the rose gold like
bottle cap so I think it's supposed to
bubble but also be like really
nourishing does it smells like sweet
almond cacao and honey I can't open this
my hands are all lotion ewwww
I've been really into bath lately now
that in this apartment I have an actual
bathtub it actually smells super similar
to this but I can smell I can't smell
the honey a little bit more all right
this is another one of those products
that I've been meaning to try for
literally years but just never have this
is the batiste dry shampoo in divine
dark I feel like I've tried the normal
one a long time ago don't remember what
I think of it I haven't tried just the
dark version actually right now I've
been using a dry shampoo and then I use
like a dark root spray over top right
now my roots are actually growing out
too like here you need to go into the
hairdresser my appointments next week I
just got the aged beautiful stuff from
Sally Beauty it's like six or seven
bucks I don't know if there'll be enough
color in here to be like a full on root
spray but at least it won't give you
that like white cast hopefully mmm oh it
smells good for some reason that's not
the scent I was expecting all right
we're coming up on the last last few
items this is the Tarte hardiest artist
Pro lash adhesive I am on a constant
hunt to find a lash glue that does not
burn my eyes and that keeps the lashes
on
I've tried latex free I feel like I've
had this talked with you guys like ten
thousand times but I feel like I've
tried every lash glue pretty much and
every single one irritates my eyes I
don't think it's the latex because I'm
not allergic to latex and I'm tried
latex free versions and I still burn so
I feel like it's some other ingredient
in there but basically when I wear
lashes it's usually just for an event
for a couple hours or to film because I
rarely can keep them on longer than a
couple hours it says it's formulated
without parabens mineral oil and a bunch
of other stuff so here's what the tube
looks like really pretty just white and
gold this I feel like I've heard so much
about since it came out this is the wet
and wild highlighting powder in blossom
glow I haven't been able to find this in
store buy me anywhere
Seattle drugstores are pretty shitty
whenever I go back home to
fornia that's when I go ham in the
drugstore usually because they have
everything a lot of people love this a
couple of my kind of Holy Grail
highlighters are actually by wet and
wild but they were a limited edition
which is why I never really use them in
videos or anything because you can get
them anyways as a really pretty print on
it
I think they had three shades in this I
got the one that looked kind of pinky
okay that looks like it could be nice
last thing is something that I found
doing a bunch of research when I was
trying to find skincare products to use
well on accutane I came across a few
different options for really gentle
facial cleansers a lot of people like
the basics at a Filipino cleanser also
the Neutrogena hydrating cleanser I
think is called but the one that I found
that apparently has the best ingredients
and everything out of those three and
that is actually gonna help your skin is
the CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser it
says this has three essential ceramides
and hyaluronic acid and I've been using
this for a couple weeks now every single
night and I freaking love this thing I
wish I used this and knew about it
before I went on accutane even I'd oily
skin because it is just such a nice
gentle cleanser that doesn't strip your
skin and that actually leaves your skin
feeling softer and like more moisturize
the other thing I like about this is
that it actually removes the remainder
of your makeup really well I wouldn't
use this to like take off all your
makeup I go in with an oil cleanser
lately and then I'll go in with this and
then I'll go in with a toner before when
I used a toner I would still get some
like makeup residue on the cotton pad
when I go in with the toner after using
this stuff there's literally nothing on
the pad like this removes all of the
remaining makeup which is great because
I've been really liking it also should
note this one passes Caroline's tests on
her blog and I think Stephanie Nicole
actually mentioned this in one of her
skincare videos too I think so that's
everything I feel like that was a Hello
