all right so today it is whole time got
a little bit wild I've been doing way
too much online shopping I've been in a
major clothes shopping mood I just
wanted to get some cute swimsuits and
just new stuff for spring and summer I
also have some home decor stuff to show
you guys so this is just a mix of a
bunch of stuff from Target ASOS American
Eagle all over Ashley just filmed half
this haul and my mic was completely off
so here we go again I've just been
waiting for that moment to happen with
this new mic I am very ready for summer
Seattle needs to get this done going the
first thing I got which I am in love
with look at this bag this just speaks
to me on so many levels this is a
drawstring bag that I guess you would
wear to the gym to be traveling a ton in
the month of May so I'm probably just
going to bring this on all of my trips
this is the most beautiful backpack I've
ever seen I'm gonna leave links to
everything I can find down below in the
description box that I got the self of
ASOS and I want to say it was under 30
bucks
I can't imagine me spending more than 30
bucks on this maybe I did I don't know I
was in the mood so if you watched my
recent shadow and schmooze video which
I'll put over here if you missed it I
talked about how I'm gonna be moving at
the end of the month or not at the end
of the month in like June or July moving
into one bedroom I'm super excited to
decorate kind of switching up my style I
want it to still be black and white
don't get me wrong there won't be color
it's a little bit more bohemian and
comfortable and less like modern and
clean so as washing Aspen and Parker's
vlog and she got a bunch of super cute
stuff from Target the home decor section
I couldn't find a couple of these things
in stores so I ended up ordering them
online what's the best way to show you
this so here's a picture of it right
here it's one of those hanging string
wall things there's a name for it
macrame but it's just this woven thing
that you can hang on the wall I feel
like against a white wall it's going to
look really good I want to do one of
those like white drapey mesh things over
the bed so I feel like this could look
cool on the wall or hung on the wall but
the couch in the living room if you
haven't checked out the target home
decor section right now you gotta go
Chrissy and I also went to the one in
Lynwood and if you're in the Washington
area that one was unreal it was
literally like an out-of-body experience
this one they also didn't have in store
so I had to get this online I'm not
gonna take it out of the packaging
because I'm going to be moving but it's
basically just an off white and black
tribal print rug it has some off-white
Castley kind of things on the end I've
been really into tassel and like string
and everything lately I'm either going
to put this at like the entryway or in
the kitchen by the sink it
is a throw blanket that I'm obsessed
with from Target it's very lightweight
and soft so perfect for summer right now
I have it folded up and kind of sitting
on the edge of my bed you guys might be
able to see it it's usually right there
in my videos in the new place in May
they're going to keep this on my bed or
drape it over the couch my bedding is
all pure white so this just adds some
nice contrast and kind of texture to it
now I'm checking the mic every two
seconds the last home decor item I got
at Target is this gold hanging thing
which I am obsessed I love all this but
I'm extra obsessed with this one you
need to chill here's a little picture of
what it looks like actually hung on the
wall I just feel like to look so good
either in the hallway or hung on the
wall somewhere in my living room I'm
pretty sure everything except the throw
blanket I got online from Target the
rest of the stuff I got in store so the
first thing is this beautiful swimsuit
this color is perfection i love this
burgundy color it almost looks like a
bralette but it's this lace high-neck
swimsuit I like that you can see some
skin through it though there's like this
mesh thing going on right there and then
it just Criss crosses in the back I got
the matching swimsuit buttons as well
which actually fit really cute because
cinches in right in the middle of the
butt which can be flattering makes your
butt look bigger
the bottoms were $14.99 and then this
top was 20 2.99 when I shop in the
target shoe section slash at most places
I'm either women size 4 which target
doesn't carry or a kid size 2 or 3 so I
picked up these flip-flops which are
just white leather super cute basic and
these are the Kat and Jack brand if
you're going to shop in a target kids
section Kat and Jack is where it's at
these were only eight bucks hell yeah
got another pair of sandals from the Kat
Jack brand in the kid section
I actually don't own a basic pair of
black sandals so I just picked up these
for the summer I feel like this will
look really cute with shorts dresses
anything this is a size three and they
were $17.99 so at the end of this month
I'm going to be going to Sasquatch which
is a music festival here in Washington
and I wanted like a fringy fairly
reasonably priced bag that I could bring
that I wasn't really scared of getting
dirty or anything sick of this crossbody
bag from Nordstrom the fringe is
actually pretty long as you can see
here's where the bag ends and the fringe
goes down pretty far I might cut the
fringe a little bit but this is the BP
brand from Nordstrom and it was around
$30 I actually haven't even opened this
yet there's a couple pockets on the
inside and it looks like a nice
cleanable material right here have some
braided detail right here so
just thought this would be cute for
festivals and summer and whatever
festivals like I go to multiple and
literally never go to music festivals so
American Eagle is having some kind of
sale online I want to say it was 25% off
the entire store maybe 30% off picked up
this really cute romper is going to be
totally hit or miss because romper is
usually make me look like a toddler
actually hold a romper in this terrific
tall video too so I guess this is a good
month for rompers super Q it's like a
gingham I think that's what this is
called print looks like a picnic table
has this really cute cutout right here
and it's just really flattering on the
top because I'm on the shorter side when
I look for rompers they have to be ones
that are tight on the top and sinchon on
the way so it doesn't make me look like
I have no body so it's just spaghetti
strap on the top and for reference I got
a size small short and rompers normally
4495 and I actually got it for 20
dollars and 23 cents
some reason they shipped this next top I
got it separately so I don't have to
receive for this one because I liked it
switches are away the receipt I'm pretty
sure this was like a major winter
markdown I think I got this for under 15
bucks and it's a super nice soft sweater
turtleneck here's what it looks like
hard to find sweaters that aren't too
long and too baggy and I feel like this
one would look super cute with jeans if
you like tucked into capris would look
really cute I love this kind of waffle
print down here I got two pairs of jean
shorts normally each of these were 49.95
and I got them both for 2810 these ones
I love and I'm keeping these these are
just ripped black denim shorts they're a
little bit high waisted the style on
these is some girls stretch size
reference I got a size two for some
reason the black ones fit me perfectly
I'm definitely keeping these but I also
got this pair which I'm going to be
returning these ones just aren't as
flattering but is the same exact size
and style and everything but for
whatever reason these ones just don't
look that great on heki like black denim
makes any outfit look 50 times cuter you
could just wear a baggy shirt with this
and just tuck it in the cute sandals and
you'd be good to go last thing I got at
American Eagle is this swimsuit top with
another high neck swimsuit which I guess
I'm into lately
I loved this white stitching around the
edge of this and this was 15 bucks and
again it has the same kind of cross back
right here I didn't get the matching
bottoms because I have black bottoms I
can just wear with this you know when
you go down the wormhole of cheap
Facebook ads for like
awful and Shion and all that that
happened has them all thrown in the same
bag and I shopped on a few different
sites so I'm going to find the exact
products I'll link them down below but I
don't really know which is from where
right now so if you have never shopped
on those kind of websites it is super
hit or miss some of the pieces are total
crap some of them are see-through some
of them just have the worst material
ever and sometimes you get really lucky
and it just is nice and it fits good and
it works out so whenever I purchase from
there I basically assume that half of
this stuff isn't going to work out but
it's so cheap that if you spend 60 bucks
and three of the pieces work out and
three don't you're still getting three
things for 60 bucks so that's how I
rationalize in my head anyways probably
not the best business practice for them
do you guys know I'm obsessed with the
leaf print I found this one piece I'm
trying to get into one pieces because
haven't been working out a whole lot
probably do that before it summer this
is super cute and it actually fits
really well sizing on there is always
really hard to figure out the best thing
to do is just read the reviews and I'm
pretty sure I got a size medium in this
again everything will be listed down
below kind of push up cuts the only
thing is the boobs are a little bit far
apart the other thing you have to look
out for when you're shopping for
swimsuits on there is most of them are
like song bottoms which I'm not about
that life so just make sure you double
check the back because 90% of them are
like song bikinis this one was actually
a total win I love this swimsuit this is
a black one-piece and it has this criss
cross thing going down the front this
one is super flattering if you're tall I
would say this one probably won't fit
but if you're more petite actually like
the perfect length a lot of one pieces
look weird because it's too long or
something on my torso but this one
actually fits perfectly this was a size
medium I got a few things from I want to
say was she in could have been wrong way
but I got this super cute belt this was
a few bucks this is what I was trying on
all the stuff within the thrift haul
video
I feel like this just spices up any
outfit it looks like some brand name one
I'm not that into fashion so I couldn't
tell you what brand it is but I know a
lot of people are kind of making
replicas of it so I just look really
good at those black tin and shorts I
show you guys to girl power
the most Awkward way possible show you
this I had this in white and black not
going to lie I kind of want to get the
white one too because I just love this
so much I love the Rose on it it's
actually really nice soft shirt again
tucked into jeans shorts I just think
this will look really cute for the
summer with like red lipstick on this I
actually haven't tried on yet the
material of this
is definitely very cheap this is like a
super long black skirt so it definitely
go past my knees which was kind of what
I was looking for one is skirt that I
could wear with wedge sandals for the
summer and this one might look cute on
the fabric of this just feels super
super cheap it's just super thin and
kind of feels like a tablecloth last
thing I got from one of the random
online cheap shops that is unknown
striped t-shirt dress I wanted one of
these that isn't super tight it's like a
baggy t-shirt dress so you could wear
with like white Adidas or vans or
something as a nice stretch to it and
the material this one does feel nice
it's thick stripes on stripes right now
so this thing I think I actually got off
of hot look I love shopping on hot look
it's where I get pretty much all of my
shoes and sometimes they have cute
clothes on there too they also have
really good makeup deals leave a link
for holic down below if you've never
shopped on there but it's Nordstrom
racks flash sale site put up new stuff
every 24 hours it's literally like my
morning ritual to check that when I'm
eating breakfast I thought would be
really cute for sasquatch or just as
like a beach cover-up with high-waisted
shorts I definitely wouldn't wear this
with the fringy first I showed you that
would be lots of fringe fringe overload
so this is a size small and the brand is
rageh last step I went to Ross for some
reason other cities I don't get that
lucky at Ross but the ones in Seattle
are pretty good but I just found a few
very summery things again more tassels
this is a lot of color for me right here
I just pictured this in the summer as
like a beach cover-up or something maybe
some pink lipstick you never know get in
wild
it is pretty see-through so I'd have to
wear a bando or something underneath
this but it's just an off-the-shoulder
top and then it has the fringe on the
sleeves and at the bottom and this was
only $7.99
I don't know how wearing suede in the
summer is going to go but I guess we'll
find out I just loved the dusty rose
kind of color of this and this is hella
soft it doesn't even feel like suede it
feels way better it's like a mix of
velvet and suede almost it's a high-neck
spaghetti top I feel like this would
look really cute with the jean jacket
and black ripped jeans or something this
was only $8.99 the last thing I have to
show you guys is a dress from Ross this
is not something I would normally go to
again I feel like my style is kind of
changing more into like bohemian stuff
than I ever happened here's what the
dress looks like so it's this off the
shoulder dress and it cinches in right
there at the waist
this one just fit me really well my
picture wearing this with like red
lipstick maybe over
new boots or something don't have
anything like this and it fit cute and
it was only $12.99 good times that rough
I think that is everything I can finally
watch the stuff and put it away so if
you enjoyed this video make sure you
give it a thumbs up it helps me out hmm
cold coffee if you like haul videos let
me know down below if you guys want to
see more of these definitely going to be
vlogging moving into the new apartment
and decorating and everything so if you
want to see more home decor hauls or
anything related to that also let me
know down below by the way you know I'm
going to get questions on my list right
now is the Urban Decay vice disturbed
liquid lipstick which is actually very
crappy but on top of it I really like
this this is the Urban Decay vice
special effects in a shade monarchy
that's what gave it this like metallic
blue purple kind of look shirts from Rus
forever 21 and julep Jenna nail polish
