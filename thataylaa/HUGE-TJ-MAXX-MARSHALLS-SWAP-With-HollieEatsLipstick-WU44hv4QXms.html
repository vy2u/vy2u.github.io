this is gonna be fun
so basically Holly from Holly eats
lipstick is one of my good friends on
YouTube we decided to do a Ross slash
mark show love slash t.j.maxx basically
any of those I think we decided on
hopefully because that's what I did swap
so we basically set a limit and then it
got stuff for each other and mailed it
to each other and now we're gonna open
things I've been following Holly for I
don't even know maybe like a year and a
half or two years now and I just love
her videos she's one of the youtubers
that I watch every single video that
comes out for reviews and
recommendations are on point and she's
also a pale princess scott Sabonis I met
Holly in real life last year at gem
Beauty and she's just like the nicest
most genuine person and those aren't had
to come by on YouTube sometimes if you

scissors so cute this is what the inside
looks like literal workout right now I
don't know where to start so let's just
dig in this is so exciting cute thank
you cards and envelopes I actually need
some more of these so this is awesome
you get sixteen note cards and envelopes
these are super cute and it just says
don't let anyone toll your sparkle these
will definitely come in handy oh hell
yeah
Deborah Lippmann nail polish and look at
this sparkly amazingness oh yeah I feel
like this will look really cool on top
of like black nail polish or something
there we go this is Deborah Lippmann
which is a really nice nail polish brand
actually don't own any Deborah Lippmann
so this is my first one so it's not good
oh cool this is soap box I've never
heard of this brand yes
a hundred percent natural spearmint
African shea butter and sea salt soap
and it looks like they donate by one and
we give one to a child in need more than
three thousand lives could be saved
every day but something as simple as a
barb soap and clean water
I can only smell right now but I'm
assuming this is really strong because
I'm getting like a little whiff and it
smells really good it's cruelty free
vegan free palm oil free all of the
fries it's a mom okay I'm gonna open
this because I see a part of it take you
through and I'm so excited because I
love this brand this is the Bliss
vanilla and bergamot body buff with shea
butter and sweet almond oil Oh
interesting before stepping into the
shower scrub yourself from collar bones
to calves it's very specific and rinse
well so it's actually like a pre shower
scrub that's really cool I've never used
on this it's kind of like a tone down
vanilla like it's not too much and it
has little exfoliating things inside
honey almond massage soap this is cool
it has little beaded things right here
so you can actually massage your body
with it that is smart whoever invented
this smart hell yeah jelly beans it's
only 10:43 a.m. right now but I kind of
want to break into these I could totally
go for some popcorn jelly beans for
breakfast been our minerals bareMinerals
moxie glasses wait this is freaking
awesome have been actually wanting to
try these for a while that color looks
beautiful I've heard these are really
good let's try one this one is just like
calling my name
super pretty whoo it smells kind of
pepperminty I feel like this would look
really good on top of like a nude these
are like right up my alley
anyone else have swatch OCD where you
have to like wipe off your swatches
right after so and there's this huge
heavy bag it looks like it's filled with
stuff this is a ton of 7xi individually
wrapped everything it looks like this is
oh this is my favorite this is the dr.
Bronner's almond I don't actually have
the almond scent so this is exciting
this is by far the best brush cleaner
I've ever tried this is a
if you don't have this yet you need it
to clean your brushes and it's super
affordable this is 399 it's better than
any bought brush cleaner I've ever tried
and the almond one smells heavenly this
smells like a cake or something
philosophy I don't think I own any
philosophy products is my first
philosophy this is almond a cream body
lotion that she's gonna smell bombing
Joe smells kind of like coconut to me oh
yeah love their packaging too like I'm
all about this font situation this is a
hundred percent natural coconut oil
coconut oil is loaded with vitamin E
proteins fatty acids and antioxidants
making it the perfect anti-aging
moisturizer let me know if you guys have
tried this with acne I'm always like a
little bit hesitant to put straight-up
oil on my face but if this is fine with
acne I won't totally try this out with
Holly skin is like literally perfect so

into stationery and planners and all
that good stuff and I know Holly is too

good inspiring pencil flash tattoos this

she is just lovin life we just take a
filming break and can I go to add myself
this is funny I actually saw these at I
think TJ Maxx I was gonna get these for
Holly and I was like this packaging I
could totally see Holly liking these are
the absolutely love lip balm and
strawberry and bubble gum I feel like
this would be a really cute thing for
Valentine's Day this one's pretty heavy
my favorite the body shop I am all about
the body shop I just there hasn't really
been anything that I've tried from there
that I haven't loved this is the body
butter in Brazilian no Brazil nut smells
good smells really different like fresh
but still kind of coconutty this reminds
me like straight-up of summer
is there anything in life more
satisfying than a brand new body butter
but I'm all about the black and gold
this is totally up my alley and it's
lined paper feels really nice this makes
me really happy
looks like there are a couple other
things down here oh my god is this it is
