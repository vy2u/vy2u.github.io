feet all right we got a little bit wild
at ulta when we moved apartments I
basically got rid of like bags of makeup
and donated it so now's the time you
know you got to restock at some point so
a lot of the stuff I'm going to show you
guys today our products I've been
looking at for a while and I finally
just caved I'm super excited that I got
a chance to work with Ebates on this
video if you guys have been watching my
channel since the beginning you know
I've literally talked about Ebates for
years basically Ulta was having double
cash back on Ebates so that's why I
justify my online shopping addiction
they basically give you cash back on
every online purchase they recently has
got this little like browser button
thing that's actually super cool it's
basically like a Chrome extension you
download it it takes like 10 seconds and
then every website they are on it'll pop
up what the cashback is and then you
literally just click activate it's like
the easiest thing ever I think I got it
eight percent cashback I usually wait
until they have a double cashback sale
because they always do it with like
Sephora and Ulta all the good makeup
sites and you get a free $25 gift card
when you sign up so hell yeah let's just
get into the hall alright so the first
thing I picked up is the Clarisonic Mia
one I've been looking at the Clarisonic
Mia for years and I just never good
justify in my head spending like $200 or
whatever this is on this thing actually
is not 200 it's like 100 I think this
thing is all over YouTube but basically
it's just a toner it's not the word what
is this them one speed facial sonic
cleansing people say that it like
changes the texture of their skin let's
open it up I got the gray one because
not about that color here's the actual
tool and then you just hook it up to
this little system and one sided to use
this I kinda want to use this tonight it
comes with the brush on here but I also
picked up the acne clarifying cleansing
kit he came with this face wash that I
heard was amazing a couple of you guys
actually snatched me photos of this face
wash and said it was really good it has
2% salicylic acid acne treatment in it
and then it comes with a different kind
of brush if you have some acne going on
next thing I got which I'm super excited
to try out is the lumen a bright now
vitamin C day cream this is like a
brightening face cream with SPF 15 I do
actually use a moisturizer in the
morning which I know is really bad I
just used my body shop tea tree primer
and this does like a good job of
moisturizing so I know
sue me I love the lumen a BB cream it's
probably my favorite BB cream and this
face cream got super good reviews let's
smell it
I love when face creams come in like
heavy jars like this you know and just
feels luxurious I don't know if old it
carries lumen a in stores I feel like
I've never seen it in stores okay come
on seriously okay great well it smell
nice all right let's just get that out
under the nail oh it feels really nice
smells super citrusy and like fresh mmm
smells really good you can kind of smell
the SPF a little bit doesn't feel greasy
at all which is good the next thing is
the Ulta contour kit I haven't heard
anyone talk about this before and I'm
kind of trying out a bunch of different
contour kits right now just to review
for you guys the warmth bronzer shade
looks like it might be nice let's
compare this to my sculpt to face my
sculpture face is my Holy Grail
that's the shade I use every day there's
two highlighters in here as well if you
have a darker complexion it looks like
they have some really nice deep shades
in this palette I'm like this little
cheap like like I might rip this thing
off next I got the big sexy hair
volumizing dry shampoo I actually tried
this when I was staying with a co-worker
in a hotel room and this stuff legit
worked I've never had something that
actually gave my hair volume I've like
super thick heavy hair that just doesn't
tease and this stuff actually worked and
it doesn't give you that like nasty
super dirty tacky feeling let's smell it
smells good just smells like fresh well
that literally went like a mile over
there I've been liking my swag dry
shampoo lately just because I spray it
and like literally white comes out I
don't know if I'm just at the end of my
bottle but got to switch it up another
hair product this is the not your
mother's beach babe texturizing sea salt
spray and I was looking at a bunch of
different texturizing sprays on Ulta
this one got really good reviews and it
was like a third of the price of a lot
of the other ones I was looking
post a photo right here of the hairstyle
I'm talking about but I've been wearing
my hair a lot like this lately I
basically just get out of the shower at
night sleep on wet hair put like
something like a texturizing spray in it
and just throw a few curls on in the
morning and it's literally the easiest
hairstyle ever I hate hair our hair is
not my thing and this is a super easy
like doable hairdo let me know down
below if you guys would want to see that
but I'm just gonna try this out and see
if it's better than the stuff I'm using
right now well it looks like there's
literally salt coming out oh I actually
forgot I ordered this I finally caved it
got the Becca shimmering skin perfecter
highlighter and moonstone I don't know
why but I have literally been putting
off buying this for like years since it
first came out I don't know why because
people say amazing things about this
moonstone looked like it was the best
shade for pale skin let's see
I hope this lives up to all the hype oh
hell yeah I just got back from work and
like threw on green eyeshadow in
lipstick so we have like 10 hour
foundation on right now I got a backup
of the Ulta brow tint in deep because I
love this stuff by far my favorite brow
gel it is amazing I like it better than
the benefit the color of this is perfect
if you have a dark hair it's like cool
toned it doesn't have too much red in it
which is something that I find with a
lot of brow products like why are you
trying to put red in that super cheap
super great you need this this is the
NYX liquid suede cream lipstick this is
from their new liquid suede line I'm not
sure if these are supposed to be
long-lasting I hope they're better than
their butter lipsticks whatever they're
called this isn't a shade stone fox is
this super unique like dark grey kind of
shade that I'm clearly weirdly attracted
to you right now and I feel like I might
slice my finger off doing this okay
let's just swatch this bad boy yes
literally like a dark grey ooh I'm
excited doesn't smell very pleasant
smells like straight-up chemicals Ulta
recently started carrying a makeup
revolution in store which I'm so excited
about because I've ordered from them
before and they're a UK brand pretty
much everything I've tried from them
I really loved I just did tutorial using
their chocolate bar palette I'll link
that down below if you haven't seen it
this is their vivid baked highlighter
and the shade radiant lights looks a
little chalky no but when you put it on
it doesn't has like a nice sheen
actually things are like five bucks or
six bucks I also picked up their blush
palette and this adds a highlight and
then a few shades of blush and then I
color a couple of contour shades as well
I like the rose gold nice sleek black
packaging the packaging on this actually
feels really nice it's kind of heavy
and there's a giant ass smear on it this
highlight blush shade is gonna be super
pretty okay at that highlight it looks
really exciting I think it's actually
supposed to be a blush but it's like a
super light shimmery pink oh yeah I'm
gonna be doing a lot of traveling over
the next couple months for work and then
it's holiday season which how the hell
is it already almost holiday season that
is crazy so I picked up a few travel
sized things the verse is this not your
mother's beach babe texturizing hair
cream so I'm assuming it's similar to
the spray but in cream form oh it smells
like coconuts you put it in damp hair
for an extra tousled matte finish hold
getting travel sized products is also a
good way to just test out products if
you don't want to buy the full size I
think also is having some kind of buy
two get one free travel situation so I
just picked up lotion even though I
don't really need lotion this is the
fresh water mist shape and everything
kind of smells like laundry detergent
then I got this tea tree oil cooling
foot scrub which I'm actually stoked to
try out I'm on this weird like foot
thing right now I got a bunch of the
body shop peppermint cooling foot
products and I don't know I'm just like
really feeling the foot products lately
I never used like a scrub thing or any
kind of papayas in my life until like a
couple months ago do normal people do
this stuff to their feet was I just
missing out on all of childhood what
smells like super pepperminty tea tree
well I think that just cleared out my
sinuses then I got a backup of my
vanilla sugar hand sanitizer and I just
throw this in my purse and it smells
freaking amazing people think you
putting on a lotion when you whip out
this stuff it doesn't smell like hand
sanitizer ow all right so that was
everything that I got went a little
crazy if you guys liked this video and
you want to see more haul videos give it
a thumbs up so i know i'll leave the
link down below for Ebates love you guys
