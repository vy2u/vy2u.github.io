don't you know what data is right now I
think it's Wednesday night I'm going to
try and post this vlog the day that I
record it today because I just feel like
there's a lot on my mind right now and I
just want you guys to be filled in with
why I haven't been posting as many
videos as I usually do maybe I should
turn the fan off turning the fan off at
ninety-degree he is dedication so it is
8:30 p.m. at night right now and I just
got home from work I got to work at 8:00
a.m. today so it was a really long day
basically there's a lot going on in my
life right now work wise and health-wise
and I just haven't um haven't feeling
too hot I'm not going to go into detail
about what's going on at work I am going
to be going out of town on a work trip
starting on Tuesday basically planning a
whole event for work on top of all my
other work stuff on top of this huge
project that just got added to my plate
and on top of YouTube and on top of
moving apartments so I just got the keys
to my new apartment today which is
really exciting it is freaking beautiful
I can't wait to show you guys I think
I'm going to do is it really dark right
now probably so there we go together I'm
probably going to do a empty apartment
tour kind of video just to show you guys
why I was standing right in front of the
oven when it's like 9 degrees also
making many chicken tacos right now
Trader Joe's is basically just a lot on
my plate right now I've been extremely
stressed and it's not helping my
migraine situation I don't really talk
about migraines on my channel because I
just feel like I don't really have to
get into health issues you guys probably
don't really care about that but it
hasn't really been debilitating and I've
been in the ER a couple times in the
last month or two which is more than
usual yeah that's all we're going to get
into about the health stuff but I just
wanted to pop on in because whenever I
don't record my normal videos for you
guys I don't want it to be interpreted
as me not caring because it's literally
the opposite not posting YouTube videos
almost stresses me out more than just
putting up my two videos a week like
normal because I just feel like it's
just something that's important to me to
post
but I also understand that life happens
and sometimes you have to put your
health and body first which is what I'm
trying to do right now so at least not
working very well because I'm recording
YouTube video right now arm skin sort
chili a chicken Taco Time
super freaking happy with my apartment
it's like way better than the unit they
showed us when we sign the lease that
happened helpful power let's just put
you here well I feel like it was just
like really delayed timing no one judge
babies I've been doing lots of apartment
shopping online I did a bunch of Groff
stuffing which I did film a home haul
before all this went down so I think
that'll be up I don't know I have to
edit it I think when I get like really
stressed I just do a lot of retail
therapy
I've done like way too much online
shopping in the last couple weeks so I
figured we do a mini haul after I make
my tacos camera just definitely fell off
of the oven why did I only put five
tacos on here Who am I kidding
all right well the tacos are in we're
gonna do a quick haul what should we do
first
I bought a ton of stuff on cotton
on which is that huge ass box you see
back there so let's do that first I had
never been on cotton on before I was
actually looking for affordable workout
clothes and that's what I found them I
feel like my world is kind of forever
changed I feel like they're what forever
21 it used to be except like cuter they
also have an insane home section a ton
of home stuff and they had like a crazy
clearance sale so let's just get into it
basically all of the clothes I got were
like under $12 which is insane I got
these black jeggings they're jeggings
got really good reviews online so I
wanted to try them out these are
definitely not jeggings they're like
straight up jeans which I'm actually
really happy about they're just like
stretchy skinny jeans the length
actually looks really good I'm 411
so it's frickin hard finding jeans that
I don't have to hem
and this length actually looks pretty
good I got a us a size four they do run
really small which is what I read online
you look like they'll fit perfectly I
also got a pair of acid-wash ones I
don't know in any acid-washed jeans and
I thought these looked exactly like
those American Apparel one i main reason
why I went on there which to get workout
clothes and I found a couple things to
these yoga pants which are a super
freakin cool except I got way too small
of a size yeah what's really cool about
these is they have this like a leathery
texture on the bottom which I thought
was really cool and they're just capris
the fabric feels really nice motivation
I don't know I got this sports bra which
I am freaking obsessed with I just love
the way that this looks a cool thing
about this is that it has underwire cups
if you're someone who doesn't like to
wear a sports bra without padding or
without like some kind of Cup action
going on
this feels really really nice and it was
super formed I think it was like $14 or
$15 on sale and it has a nice back I got
a top which I don't know if I'm gonna
wear this for working out or just for
life it's just this super baggy top I
think it says Manhattan or something on
the front who knows I just liked the
black and white it could actually pretty
much be a dress on me I got a few really
cute shirts slouchy white tank top it's
actually pretty see-through so I
definitely have to wear like a cami or
bralette or something underneath it this
white crop top by the way I got rid of
like five bags of clothes when I moved
and so now I'm actually trying this
thing where I only buy things that I
really like and then I'm actually gonna
wear what just tends to be like black
and white and that's it so I got this
white crop top without be cute with like
a swimsuit or something this is the only
item of color a rose like baby doll
who's out these are called and they had
a bunch of different colors and these
here's the word that was all the clothes
I got from their shipping for coming
from the UK was actually pretty fast
pillows I'm not going to take these out
of the plastic because I'm going to be
moving them to my new apartment but I
saw these X black and white pillows and
I was like
Leigha I need these they're kind of cool
because the other side is a totally
different pattern here's the mint one
which I really like then I got some bugs
they were having this crazy like
dishware sale so I got four of these
white mugs and they were each a dollar
the kinda remind me is like golf balls
the texture on them they have these in
like mint color and a light blue I think
then these mugs which I'm freaking
obsessed with the black in my ex again I
think that's everything from cotton the
up and just beep I have no idea I'm
gonna do a really quick Victoria's
Secret haul because that happened to I
went on there because they had their
semi-annual sale
I recently been wearing one of their
bras that fits me better than any bra
has ever fit me in my entire life I just
got another one because it was on sale
and I wear the same bra every single day
how did perfect coverage I get was
totally off so just a white one right
now I have their oh the front of this
one is actually different I also got a
ton of underwear I think okay that goes
Jill all of the underwear I got were on
sale for five dollars
I should probably take this up right I'm
just gonna go super quick through the
underwear Excel know how exciting this
is for you guys
neon these white and gray lacy things
right what's going on bag oh I like
these ones blue tie-dye lacy kind of
thing I like this material no show panty
I think that's what it's called and this
feels like a really nice quality lace
well these are these are very
see-through purple pink tie-dye that's
really cute I like this cut it actually
goes down a little bit it's like the low
V um alright Taylor I think I've enough
underwear for like the rest of my life
another pair of the cheeky booty shorts
these are really cute this is not your
showing up on camera but it's like this
neon green I'm going to get more like
cute workout tops right now I just use
like my old college shirts this one I
thought was really cute it's neon white
and black and yellow it was like really
nice soft material I'm just gonna eat my
tacos and I'm definitely not good I'm
going to attempt to that is hot I'm
