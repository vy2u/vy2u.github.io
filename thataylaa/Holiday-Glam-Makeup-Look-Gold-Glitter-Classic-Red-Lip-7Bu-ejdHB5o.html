amounts of gold glitter on their face
all right so today we have a holiday
glam kind of look how is it already
almost December I need to whip out the
Hanukkah bush soon I was feeling just
thrown glitter on my face today so that
is what happened a lot of the products I
use today are either from the Korean
beauty haul video that I did last get
down below or from glambot which you
guys know is one of my obsessions in
life you guys have a hurting lamb but
they basically sell pre-owned products
they have freaking bomb sales lately
they have a huge sale coming up for
Cyber Monday and Black Friday they're
gonna have like a dollar store section
lots of good stuff I do have a thirty
percent off coupon code if you're a
first-time glambot shopper I'll link it
down below if you've already shopped on
there make sure you sign up for their
email newsletters that's how I always
get on their sales because sells
out fast on their the thirty percent off
code is only good for the first 72 hours
so make sure you go ahead and utilize
that if you guys want to see how I got
this look you're in the right place just
keep watching what we do here just go
back back back
okay it is Sunday and we are a leper
open it up today got the girl's mug
let's do this by the way the next season
of girls comes out in like a couple
months who's excited I am I've already
washed and primed my face I just used
the Urban Decay just lick in a tube
primer for the first time from limbo
this is a mattifying gel primer if
you've used the makeup forever
mattifying primer that's been my like
go-to mattifying primer lately I don't
know why but my skin I think my skin is
dry so it's starting to like over
produce oil because it's winter I don't
know my skin has been getting a little
bit oily throughout the day so I've been
using that primer I really like that one
it works super well but it feels super
tight on your face like you feel like
you just had some Botox done this one
doesn't feel quite as tight right now so
far so good we'll see how it wears
throughout the day for foundation today
we're gonna be mixing the Kat Von D
lock-it tattoo foundation this isn't the
shade l42 that they discontinued for a
little bit and then they brought it back
hello yeah and the Leo Li BB cream this
one is way too dark for my skin and this
one is way too light for my skin so
we're gonna have a foundation baby I'm
just gonna mix these on the back of
Kalat right now on my Too Faced Born
This Way Foundation review there were a
lot of comments saying to review this
foundation so I figured I'd whip it out
and try it out again I wasn't a huge fan
of it back in the day why is this having
issues coming out it's like full eye
itself it is way too thick and cakey
looking on my skin for my liking even
when I apply it with like a Beauty
Blender or something so I'm gonna try
mixing it in with a few different
products and see which I like best and
maybe we'll do a review on it mix them
it up
it is super full coverage so I did about
half a pump of that and then a pump of
leo le and we're just gonna tap away my
favorite foundation brush of life no
wearing earrings this is a really good
time to put on earrings when you have
foundation all over your hand good ideas
Taylor I would just like to note that I
washed my hair two days in a row this
week that is a world record for me so my
favorite foundation brush ever is the
Sigma f80 to brush this guy it's a round
kabuki brush it is amazing for blending
out foundation and giving you
really good coverage I think I have a
20% off code of Sigma so I'll link it
down below even though they are pretty
pricey foundation brushes for me are
worth the investment I got this and it's
like freshman year of college I think my
skin went through a really good phase
and I went through a really bad phase
again make a week ago and it's just now
starting to clear back up I started
using the freo foreo luna mini and i
actually really freaking liked it i
think i'm going to have a whole review
coming on that bad boy but that was the
only thing i switched up in my skincare
routine and my skin started clearing up
again so i don't know it's a lot less
abrasive I guess then the what's called
Clarisonic it is a little bit difficult
to blend out I don't know if that's just
because this is a thicker combination of
foundation or the primer is just a
little bit difficult to blend out on top
of but it's not like lighting on super
smooth or anything so I'm just gonna go
back over spots that need a little more
coverage i'm gonna take a dampened
sponge and just kind of bounce over the
foundation my face this is actually by
it cosmetics and it comes with their new
dual ended foundation stick and I
actually like this so much better than
the Beauty Blender it has this flat side
right here like the Real Techniques
sponge but then it goes up into a point
so you can get like under your eye on
things it's just great like I don't know
why I like this so much better than
Beauty Blender but it doesn't soak up as
much product for me I don't know if you
can buy it separately but even though if
the foundation stick isn't my favorite I
would totally buy it just for this
sponge zooming in a little bit my
eyebrows are a little bit Krait now I've
gone through a phase where they're just
like not working with me you know what
I'm saying so I picked up this so Susan
concealer quad I've never seen this
brand heard of this brand or anything I
saw it on glambot and I saw that there
was like a white concealer so obviously
have to try it out so I think I'm gonna
mix these two lightest shades for under
my eyes whoo this feels pretty try it
out and like full-on rubbing this will
be interesting maybe just needs to be
warmed up a little bit yeah this is
gonna be interesting I don't know if
this will work for him to the eyes let's
try and spot conceal and see what
happens
nothing's really happening yeah I don't
think this will work
under the eyes so we're gonna go in with
a different concealer I'm going with the
Maybelline instant age rewind concealer
this is the dark circle eraser I haven't
used this in a while kind of forget what
I think about this I think it's like
super pink like it's a salmon concealer
there's not a whole lot left
I've been trying this new thing where I
use up all of my products before I
attempt to buy new ones like drugstore
makeup especially cuz I have a time
um so the next empties video is gonna be
a little little cry wow this one just
kind of came off this is super salmon
I'm liking it though when you blend it
out it just looks super brightening
which I like I fell asleep at two last
night and then woke up at six thirty
wide awake dark circles are on a whole
new level right now it is already
starting to crease on my lids a little
bit so I'm gonna go ahead and set that
super quick using Physicians Formula to
correcting powder like always oh yeah
we're looking real awake now Oh before I
forget a couple people have mentioned
that I mentioned I'm doing a hundred
thousand subscriber giveaway and it
hasn't been up yet I am still doing that
so stay posted I just had a couple
giveaways on Instagram and when I think
on Twitter before they're just trying to
kind of space them out but that is still
coming I have the whole box I'm gonna
let the foundation set a little bit
before we put on bronzer and all that
good stuff we're gonna go with brows I
got the Ardell dark brow what is this
brow pomade
I actually got this at Cosmo Prof but
I'm pretty sure you can get this out
like Fred Meyer or any drugstore haven't
heard anything about this yet so let's
see you can guessing this is supposed to
be similar to like the Anastasia Beverly
Hills one which I use almost every day
it comes with a double-ended brush which
is nice there's just fully on one end
and then this angled one which actually
looks really nice it's like pretty stiff
which I like so let's just bully these
out it looks like it has a little bit of
a red tint in it which I'm not a huge
fan of but we'll see it's like super
creamy
so far like it's super easy to work with
and you kinda can just work with what's
already on your browser you don't have
to keep dipping in and going back one
thing I love about the dipbrow from
Anastasia Beverly Hills is that it lasts
for freaking ever so this stuff lasts as
well I think this is like a total dupe
so far I'm really liking this stuff it's
gonna go in with the etude house brow
gel that I got and I mentioned this and
my Korean beauty haul but it is way too
late and read like look at that so we're
just gonna go in off my ultra brow tint
that I use every single day and I love
for eye primer I'm gonna go with this
proof 10 eye primer I haven't tried this
out yet this was also in the Korean
beauty haul I haven't tried this I've
heard it's really good so we're just
gonna
oh it looks like super watery kind of or
something not a whole lot of like color
pigment in it oh yeah interesting it's
kind of like blending away my concealer
so I'm just gonna tap it in I feel like
this is when those eye primers that kind
of has to like dry and set before you go
in with shadow I'm gonna go ahead and
set that with just a creamy looks just
like a white eyeshadow it just feels
like it needs to be set you know what I
mean it's like starting the crease a
little bit whoa what is happening okay I
don't know what just happened there but
whatever shadows we put on top will
cover it up so I think we're gonna do a
reddish goldish holiday winter glam kind
of look I don't really know we'll see
what happens I'm gonna go with the Kat
Von D shade + light eye palette I am in
love with this thing I don't know why I
put off buying this for so long but it
is freaking amazing I've been using it
almost every single day you just have
really good like basic colors so just
taking the shade right here we're gonna
put this all in the crease don't you
love when there's like one eyebrow hair
that won't stay in place next I'm gonna
go in the NARS Steven Klein palette from
glambot and this is actually a highlight
blush palette this is in vengeful I
think we're gonna use this shade and try
it on
I use this as a cheek highlight I don't
know how pigmented this is gonna be so
we'll just go to town oh okay it's
actually like a super pretty cranberry
shade guys so I'm just kind of blending
this on the outer third I'm blending it
up into the crease a little bit it's
actually super pretty I think that's the
first time I've ever done eyes before
the rest of my face and next I'm going
to take this Jakob beauty triple baked
eyeshadow thing I freaking love these
identical Instagram posts on them and
swatch them but these are beautiful I
think this is like a totally underrated
product these are like $6 from Ulta this
is in the shade cherry fudge sundae and
they're just absolutely beautiful I
think I'm going to take this middle
shade first and just put this all over
the lid look at how pretty that is
I'm just bringing this all the way into
my inner corner and then blending it
outwards I'm kind of feeling glitter I
think we're gonna do it I haven't done
to look with glitter well why are we
blue this is just when the glitters from
the Mac Holiday Collection a couple
years ago you can use any gold glitter
that you have you can get little glitter
packets from Sally Beauty for like $2
and those work just fine too any like
finally mailto glitter will do so I like
to actually use eyelash glue to apply
glitter to the lid there are lots of
different ways that you can do it
certain brands make like actual glitter
glues but I'm just gonna brush a little
bit of this on top of the lid then go
straight in with the glitter so I'm just
dipping this straight in my brush
straight into the glitter it's gonna be
glitter everywhere oh that just that on
my crease good we're just gonna have
that baby on if you don't want it kind
of fall out you should probably do your
face makeup first I mean your eye makeup
first I didn't really think that through
glitter was kind of an impromptu
decision eyelash glue does hold it on
pretty well though oh yeah
gotta love some glitter not bringing
this all the way to my outer third
because I do still want the outer third
to be dark like smoked out a little bit
so I'm just using a powder brush to kind
of dust off any glitter fluff
got a glitter mustache going on oh good
now that we have that down I'm gonna go
back in with the shade and light palette
and I'm just going to go in with I think
the black can just place this on the
outer third the be there we go to be and
just blend this a tiny bit into the
crease
okay I'm gonna bring the gold a little
bit farther out just cuz I don't want it
like abruptly stop right there we have
our glitter on I would definitely
suggest doing your eyes first if you
decide to do this look we're having a
glitter party on the face so I'm gonna
go in with this eyeliner oh my eye line
this was also in the Korean beauty haul
this is just a good liquid eyeliner with
a superfine a point so I think it'll be
decent to go over glitter glitter is
always hard to go over with eyeliner
we're gonna do lashes too so I think I'm
just going to do this super a thin line
is actually going over the glitter
pretty well
okay so I'm gonna go back in with the
Jacob UD trio and go in with this red
shade down here we're just gonna blend
this on the lower lash line I'm gonna
take a flat liner brush and go back in
with the black eye shadow from Kat Von D
and just kind of use this as an eyeliner
and just kind of press it in to the
outer 1/3 on the lower lash line I'm
gonna take this white eyeliner from
colour-pop and just put this on the
waterline you can do waterline Islander
without opening your mouth we're a
frickin magician
okay last step for the eyes I'm gonna go
back in with this NARS duo and take this
gold shade and put this on the inner
corner on the bottom lash line oh that's
a super pretty shade this we have some
pretty crazy glitter going on I'm going
to apply a coat of mascara before we put
on falsies I usually do it after falsies
but I just want to make sure the lashes
are fully coated and they don't have
like glitter all over them just change
out of the leopard robes getting pretty
toasty but what are we doing mascara is
drying let's do bronzer my favorite
bronzer of life lately has been the
bodyshop honey bronze it is amazing it
blends out beautifully oh
her foundation is fully set now I'm tiny
bit of this on my temples as well it's a
virtue Kylie we're gonna try out this
quad no duo again oh heck yeah
that was actually beautiful do you guys
see that highly for some reason it's
always so hard to show up on camera I
think it's like the angle of the light
thing I love about Glenn but is that you
can get limited-edition stuff that's not
like $200 over price like it is on eBay
I'm also running this down the bridge of
my nose and Cupid's bow whoo it is hot
in here going on with this two-faced
blush also I'm so jealous of the people
who have snow right now I follow all
these Chicago Instagram accounts because
I love Chicago and they just got snow
it's November come on Seattle okay
anyways this is in the shade love flush
and this is like the perfect winter
blush I've been wearing this almost
every single day this is part of to face
to face holiday collection they have
three different ones of these and it
comes with a trio of Milton lipsticks
actually did a whole blog post on my
blog which I'll link down below of my
October favorites since I never posted
an October race and rejects video and
this is one of the products in there I
would never normally gravitate towards
this color like you would think is way
too dark for my skin tone but it just
looks like a really nice very kind of
flush uh let's do some full sea action I
think I'm gonna try out these sweet
iWatch eyelashes this is also from the
green beauty haul probably gonna have to
trim these bad boys down good so far I
really like how this foundation combo
looks I feel like the blush and
everything blend it out really nicely on
top of it and it still has some like do
to it it doesn't want fully matte which
I like okay I really like the way these
look they're like the perfect amount is
separated and they're actually not too
long or too intense and these were super
affordable you get five pairs of them
and I think they were under seven
dollars all right so the falsies are
drying I'm gonna go in with some bottom
mascara I can't find my wet and wild
make a length mascara anywhere right now
so I've been using the falsies push-up
which I'm not a huge fan of for the
bottom lashes but it's here
okay lips so we're just gonna do a
standard red Holliday flip so I'm going
to start out by lining my lips I'm gonna
use the colourpop lip liner in poison
I'm just fully filling these in I found
math Ruby one glambot heck yeah in the
last one my video some people were
curious as to how you can like sanitize
lip products but you do at makeup
counter Suzy spray it with alcohol and
wipe it off and it completely sanitizes
it and you can tell that they've also
chopped off the top part of it so it's
totally fine if you are like a
germaphobe you can totally sanitize it
again yourself this is like a mat true
Matt holiday red I love this shade all
right so this is the final look here's
