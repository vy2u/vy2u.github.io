we talk about how there's an unfair
amount of pretzels in here not right all
right so today we have a Hobby Lobby
haul I don't know what happened but I've
been like crazy into DIY iing right now
I think I've been watching too many home
decor hauls I blame it on YouTube before
a couple weeks ago I had never been to
Hobby Lobby I'm not quite sure how I was
moving along in the world politics aside
Hobby Lobby is amazing time like a mix
of Michaels and home goods like half of
their store is for like the extremely
crafty DIY people and the other half is
just bucket I'm just gonna buy this
argument they just rotate their sales
whatever isn't on sale when you go it's
gonna be on sale next week most likely
so I keep that in mind if you go
shopping at Hobby Lobby pretty much
everything I got was 40% off which was
insane so great so I'm still kind of
decorating my room in my apartment I
will be doing a room tour once it's all
done
oh I'm just gonna show you guys what I
got and let's do this the first thing I
got is this vase thing I don't even know
what you're supposed to put in here I
think it's just like decorative that's
why I got it I really liked the metallic
mirrored look with the rope I think it
looks kind of like cool and rustic my
style has kind of changed it should be
more like why is this echoing I should
be more like classic traditional and I'm
kind of moving into like the rustic more
modern look if that makes sense I don't
know but I feel like this was a good
combo of the two styles and I really
really like this still know where I'm
putting this but we're gonna figure it
out this I'm keeping it next thing I got
is this burlap canvas I thought this
would be really cool to just paint
something like gold on here again kind
of a combo and there's hair lovely again
kind of a combo of like rustic and not
glam I don't know what the style is I
did get another huge canvas that I did
paint I'm gonna be making a video on it
I filmed the whole thing so be on the
lookout for that along with this I got
black gold and white acrylic paint so
we're like two dollars each done the
cabinet right now are also get them but
that's what I'm gonna be painting this
thing with well so then I got this into
and candleholder this sounded like a lot
better idea in Hobby Lobby than it was
when I got home I don't know it reminds
me too much of Halloween I feel like
what do you guys think of this could
look good I just am not really sure how
to make it look good without looking too
like cheesy and Halloweeny
it was 40% off I might be returning it I
don't know it smells man so to
go along with that I obviously got three
of these candles these are just like
normal unscented white candles I
probably wouldn't actually like these
are just for looks side aisles always
get you you know I was just walking by
on my DIY mission and I saw this
notebook and I felt like I had to have
it it's just completely blank on the
inside I think yeah just lined and it
has gold on the side which I really
liked and I just thought this would be a
good notebook for writing down YouTube
stuff and my schedule and random
that I probably don't even need to write
down
I'm not telling the crisis by the way
but this was $4.99 and this was like one
of the only things that wasn't on sale
when I got it
everything else I've showed is between
nine dollars and fifteen dollars but it
was forty or fifty percent off that
price so then I got a bunch of foam
paint brushes these are just always good
to have around I just got like the value
packs to them because I always go
through these I don't like washing
actual paintbrushes
so even when I paint furniture I use
foam brushes especially if you're gonna
be using like primer and stuff that's
just the painting asked to wash it out
with a paint brush so you probably want
to use a foam brush I do have a whole
video on how to paint your furniture
without sanding if you want to see that
random but that was like one of my most
popular videos I've ever made it's
always the unexpected ones so then I got
this ribbon I don't even know what I'm
using this for I just felt like I had to
have it I'm all about the black and gold
and the like Moroccan print that's what
this wall is over here that I usually
film in front of I don't know maybe for
Christmas presents this was $2.99 Nana
was 40% off next I got this cardboard
little sign I'm going to end up painting
this and
these two poke in around the corners or
the edges of it to kind of make like a
studded outline effect and this is
probably just gonna sit on one of my
shelves or on my wall
this is $2.99 40% off it was like a doll
or something and these are just normal
thumbtacks I actually got these at
Dollar Tree you think yeah I ended up
getting a thumb tacks at Dollar Tree
because they were like $5 at Hobby Lobby
and that's a little ridiculous then I
got three just glass mason jars
these were $1.99 40% off it's kind of
funny because I used to get these from
the thrift store and you can buy them
cheaper if you buy them new weird I
bought three of these because I was
gonna hot glue them together to make a
like DIY brush holder kind of things
like super basic but I think I'm gonna
do that because I don't like having
random cups all over the place I just
want all my brushes in one place then I
got this e6000 glue I was looking for
the like wood as nails or whatever it's
called glue and they didn't have it so I
ended up getting this is just a wood
glue if you saw my post on Instagram I
stained my IKEA dresser and put these
like gold corners on it and that's what
I use to glue them on I didn't want to
like screw into the akio desk so I just
glued them on with this stuff it is
white whichever didn't realize I wish I
got the clear one but what are you gonna
do alright the last couple things are
actually from Dollar Tree first one is
this candle holder and the second thing
is this silver plate what I'm gonna end
up doing is blowing the plate on top and
it's going to be kind of a perfume
holder I'm thinking about making all
these into like one quick easy dollar
trade DIY video let me know down below
if you guys would want to see that they
are like super basic things that you can
do so that was everything I got at Hobby
Lobby I feel like I'm gonna be addicted
