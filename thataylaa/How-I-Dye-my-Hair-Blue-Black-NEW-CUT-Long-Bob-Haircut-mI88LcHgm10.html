start this video I had a 2 a.m. idea to
start looking at pictures of logs and
ended up trapping off 11 inches the next
day so this happened impulsive decisions
are my forte so this video is just going
to be showing you guys the new cut and
also how I dye my hair I color my hair
at home I have for years if you have
dark hair it's so easy to do yourself
this is just what I do I'm going to
start out with how I dye my hair and
then you guys will see how my hair used
to look and then I'm going to go into
what my hair looks like now
all right dyeing the hair the first
thing I do is take off the leopard robe
and put on a really hideous black hair
dye shirt that I use for dyeing my hair
every single day
I typically dye my roots about every
four to six weeks and I do my whole head
probably every three months or as soon
as it starts fading a little bit I
usually switch off between different
hair dyes it's really easy to test out
different ones with black hair dye today
I'm using a salon which is freakin
awesome you basically go online take a
hair quiz they match you with an expert
colorist and they basically create a
custom color for your hair so mine is
soft black with a tint of blue on the
roots and then a blue gloss on the rest
of my hair so they formulated two
separate bottles for me and it only cost
twenty bucks which I feel like is so
cheap you guys can get 50% off so you
can get your first one for $10 with the
link in the description box which is
insane like as cheap as a box dye you're
basically getting professional-grade
hair color and advice you just died at
home yourself so it comes with this kit
that comes with stain guard remover
shampoo and conditioner so I'm just
starting out by brushing my hair and
then I'm going in with stain guard on my
forehead this just helps to make sure
you don't dye your actual skin your
stylist is also available by phone or
email so if you're like mid Diane hair
and you're having an emergency or you
have a burning question give him or her
a ring so I'm just rubbing this down the
neck since I dyed my hair darker than my
natural color which is like a strawberry
blonde I always start out with the roots
so I'm using a 20 volume developer and
then the root color it's just like a
normal color you just pour it in and
shake it up and you're good to go put
those gloves on and then they do give
you custom instructions for your color
which is pretty cool they actually tell
you specifically what's in each bottle
and how they mixed it they save all of
your info on file too so if you want to
go back and say like I want more blue in
the dye they know exactly what to do
next time so I go ahead and just start
by applying my roots I always start in
the center and then I kind of just
portion it off with the actual head of
the bottle like kind of part it and just
rub it in with my fingers so this is
just always what I've done I framed my
face first and then I'll go in to the
specific sections
and get all of my roots covered this is
totally doable by yourself but it is a
lot easier if you have a friend or
roommate who can get the back for you
I'm so used to doing it myself now over
the years that I'm just kind of nowhere
to go so now that my roots are all done
I'm going in with that blue gloss and
just shaking it up you don't have to
section off your hair for me it's just
easiest to make sure I get every section
and I basically just pin them up and
then I'll take a section I'm starting
with my left side today and I literally
just squirt the dye on the hair and then
kind of use my fingers to rub it in and
make sure it's all covered while I'm
waiting for my color to develop I
usually pluck the brows and do all the
things that I've been procrastinating
doing so I wash my hair with the shampoo
and conditioner that came in the box and
here's what the color look I was
blow-drying my hair this day so I'm just
putting in some heat protectant and this
smells so freakin amazing this is by a
salon and it smells like a perfume as it
has antioxidants and vitamin b5 in it so
it'll help your color from fading as
well then I'm going in with the
anti-frizz serum and I don't like to put
this on my roots but I just put it from
about my ear length down since my hair
is super thick and naturally wavy I
definitely always put some kind of
smoothing product or oil in to help with
the frizz situation if we're happy with
how the color turned out I feel like
especially in natural lighting it has a
really nice blue tint to it this video
is filmed over like a couple weeks Stan
so this is how the hair dye looks after
two weeks I wash my hair about two to
three times a week three times is very
generous probably two times a week my
hair doesn't get super oily so I just
dry shampoo it up and we're good to go
but this is how the color looks it looks
super shiny and healthy I love the color
it's staying in really well and I think
it has a perfect amount of like a bluish
tint to it when I'm outside you can
definitely see the blue tint a little
bit more super genuinely happy with the
color I will be repurchasing a salon for
a shirt I really like that when I wash
my hair a ton of color doesn't come out
in the tub I feel like when I use my box
dyes every time I wash my hair is like
black liquid pouring down the drain when
I've been washing my hair not a whole
lot has been coming out so I feel like
it's just staying in my hair really well
okay so now that we are 11 inches
shorter so I'm going to sort the
pictures right here then I showed my
hairstylist what I wanted I feel like
that's helpful if you're going for the
same kind of look I basically just like
instagrammed long bobs for two hours at
2:00 a.m. it was a good time I am
definitely still in shock mode like I
was sitting in the chair and my hair
stylist Danielle was like are you ready
for this I don't think I really process
what I was doing until after 11 inches
had been chopped off my hair but I
donated it to Locks of Love in the
charity that that slando needs to is a
children's wig donation I do like it I
feel like I'm still getting used to it
and the cut isn't exactly what I want
yet I'm actually going to be going in in
a few days back to her to have her just
thin out the back a little bit because
I'll show you guys basically angle it a
little bit more like I want there to be
a clear angle in the front and then also
my hair is so thick that it just is way
too heavy and like chunky in the back so
I'm gonna have her thin it out of it I'm
going to show you guys the back now so
here's what the back looks like I just
want it to be a little more like angled
and edgy and less like soccer mom so
here's what it looks like up close so
you guys can see how she layered it and
stuff I'll probably update what it looks
like on Instagram or snapchat so make
sure you're following me on there if
you're curious I literally got this done
yesterday so I haven't played around in
styling it too much yet but I'll observe
a picture right here of it curled and
this is kind of like how I left the
salon then I went home and I kind of
styled it myself a little bit more and
here's a picture of that check it curled
again I think once there's like layers
in the back and it's less thick it'll
look a lot better curly right now I'm
feeling the straight a little bit more
