video no it took me way too long to get
this video up I kept putting it off
because I feel like I have so much to
tell you guys and it's going to be a
very long video but I have time to film
I'm ready and we're doing this today so
if you've been a subscriber or Instagram
follower or anything like that for a
little bit you know that I've been
working at Mac I am a freelance makeup
artist that's my position title there so
in this video I'm just going to talk to
you about how I landed the job the
interview process and then also I asked
you guys on my Instagram if you have any
questions so at the end of the video or
kind of like throughout I'm going to be
answering your guys questions from
Instagram I do want to start this off by
saying that there is not one way to get
a job at Mac every interview process is
different depending on your location
your manager things like that so if you
want to get a job at Mac this isn't the
only way to go about doing it and this
is just kind of my experiences obviously
everyone has a different experience this
is just what happened to me makes it
sound like it's a bad thing this is how
I got the job so I have always kind of
done freelance makeup on the side
throughout high school throughout
college for some reason I never really
thought to apply a Mac just because I I
kind of envisioned you having to go to
cosmetology school I don't know it just
never really popped in my head for some
reason till I actually got a job at
Sephora and then one of my friends was
like why don't you apply for Mac that is
a great question so I started doing a
bunch of bunts a bundt cake so I started
doing a bunch of research on how to get
a job at Mac at this point I was still
kind of up in the air about Sephora
obviously Mac is like my number one if I
got the job at Mac I thought I was going
to keel over and die because I'd be so
happy so after I was like oh yeah maybe
I could get a job at Mac I just did a
 ton of research like literally
hours and hours of research what you
want to do is first of all the first
time you go into the Mac counter have
your resume ready we're all black look
like you would look if you work at Mac
you can't really write
your makeup skills on a piece of paper
the first impression that they're going
to get of you is how you present
yourself be full-on decked out in full
face of makeup going to work after this
this is something that would be like
appropriate to wear on your interview
and also just when you first drop off
your resume you want to show your makeup
skills on your face obviously be super
bubbly outgoing say hi to everyone
working there feel like you're almost
being interviewed the second you walk
into the store or the counter or
whatever so just present yourself as you
would in an interview basically so after
I dropped off my resume the manager told
me that she thinks there might be
freelance positions opening up basically
unless you've worked at a makeup counter
before I don't think you have to start
in freelance but probably 90% of the
people do stamp start in freelance I
think it's cool that Mac hires from
within so once you're in freelance then
you can work your way up to like
part-time full-time positions if you
want to if not you can do what I'm doing
and just stay as freelance and the cool
thing about freelance is that you can
move around so whatever sitting I'm in I
can call up the Mac counters and be like
hey I'm here if you need people to work
I'm available so that's something that's
really great for me because being a
college student and graduating soon and
moving around I don't know where I'm
gonna be yet so that's just something
that's really awesome and that's why I
love working freelance so most people
start in freelance unless you have
significant experience or have worked at
a counter for a while before or whatever
some other circumstance so about like a
week went by and I decided to follow up
with her so I gave her a call and I was
like hey I'm really interested in the
freelance position and she's like thank
you so much for checking back I would
just be really confident in persistent
don't think that you're bothering them
obviously they don't call them every day
but if you want the job definitely
follow up because that's gonna show them
that you're really serious about it and
that you really want the job I followed
up with her and on the phone right then
she made an appointment with me to have
an interview from this point I think
this is where a lot of people have
different experiences depending on again
like the location how big your store is
if it's a free-standing store things
like that a lot of people go through a
very intense
of interview process not that mine
wasn't intense but I didn't have to go
through as many stages I think as a lot
of people do so basically what she told
me before the interview was that I would
have to bring in my own model to do
makeup on I think she said I would have
30 minutes to do a daytime look and then
15 minutes to transform it into a
nighttime look this is like six months
ago now so if that's wrong it goes by
super fast but that's what you have to
be able to do if you're working in a
matte counter it can't be sitting there
doing someone's makeup for an hour when
you have 20 other customers so I think
I've had like five days to prepare for
the interview I sat down with my friend
who is the model I did it exactly as if
I would do it in the interview and we
just practice I tie myself we did it a
couple times if you don't have all matt
products to practice on it's totally
okay I didn't either what I did was just
did a ton of research like I said I
looked up like dupes for the colors that
I had so I could just like know what I
was gonna be dealing with I did a really
neutral daytime eye for the nighttime
look I just smoked it out with like
carbon and then added diva I think for
the lipstick and the liner maybe a
little bit more bronzer - also testing
you based on the fact that you can talk
to someone while you're doing your
makeup and you can like schmooze with
them it's not just like you're sitting
there in silence putting on their makeup
you have to act like they're real
customer and you have to act exactly as
you would is if you were working there I
think the part that I was most nervous
about was the Sanitation stuff I was
reading things online about people
having like Sanitation horror stories
during their interview and it really
freaked me out but luckily my manager
wasn't that strict about it and she kind
of was like helping me through the
process first of all use as little
brushes as possible because that means
that you're showing the client that they
can do this many things with only three
brushes and they're more likely to buy
the three brushes but also you can keep
a cleaner workstation so what you want
to do is start off by laying out tissues
all over the counter I put tissue for
like all the eye products all the face
products the lip products and then the
brushes you'll have in your brush felt
they basically want to try and keep
everything as organized as possible
you're using any of the lipsticks lip
glosses mascaras things like that you
need to use disposable ones and you
can't read it there's a lot of videos
and articles and stuff about how to
sanitize makeup at Mac so I'm not going
to go to in depth about that process
also a big tip to help you throughout
the interview if you pick like three or
four products and just know a few facts
about each of those things the manager
is going to see that you did your
research and that not only you know how
to apply foundation but you know why
you're applying that foundation on their
skin type make sure you ask their skin
type first thing that's a big one just
like ask questions like you normally
would with a client I made sure I
brought up the back to Mac program fee
Viva Glam fund things like that just to
show that you are able to sell Mac
basically and that you did your research
so I thought after that interview I
would have like a sit-down interview
with her or something like that um like
at a different time but she actually
just did it right then so after we did
the makeup she said it looked really
good she loved it she took pictures of
it to show the other manager we went
outside and sat on a bench and just had
kind of like a sit-down interview
particularly asked me like normal
interview questions you know obviously
why do you want to work for Mac just
typical interview questions so just have
those answers kind of prepared said that
she would get back to me within a few
days so I ended up calling her back a
few days later because I had to let
Sephora know whether or not I was taking
the job obviously Mac was my number one
choice so if I got the job I was going
to take it in a second she just told me
on the phone like we would love to offer
you a freelance position at Mac and I
was ecstatic if you're following me on
Instagram that day is probably a little
obnoxiously happy but it was really
exciting for me it's still kind of crazy
to me that I'm working at Mac just
because like it's Mac it's just really
fun for me and it doesn't feel like
working with that being said know what
you're getting into
working at Mac is not an easy job you're
on your feet for you know the whole
shift so like basically eight to nine
hours
I think that if you're interested in
working at Matt go for it don't need to
go to cosmetology school or anything
like that which i think is cool because
it's all about your skills and your
ability to sell and communicate with
people so if you know how to do those
things and you're set
racquel 13a says do they make you try
out everything first of all I don't
think make me mr. right verb I would
love to try out everything again this is
speaking from freelance it's a lot
different if you're permanent because
that means that you go through Mac
training I mean you can go around in the
store and obviously try out anything
they don't like send you home with a
 ton of stuff and be like hey play
with this you're curious with stuff like
try it out in the store my first month
working there I was kind of thrown in
during like Black Friday in the holidays
so that was an interesting experience I
would just like go around and they have
this whole book that tells you in detail
about every product I would just like
read through that book when there was
free time or downtime and just go around
and like test out the products it's hard
when you first start because you don't
know where anything is you have no idea
about the actual details or how to sell
the product so it's really just about
like listening to your co-workers seeing
how they explain products seeing what
works seeing what doesn't work it's
Emily zero for says what do you do on a
daily basis at work I'm just helping
people find the products that they're
looking for there's different like
events and things like that so prom
season was like a couple weeks ago so we
had like chairs out what we just did
prom makeup for like five hours which
was really fun for me that's what I love
I love like sitting down with one person
and focusing on them and being able to
talk to them and like find out about
their life I don't know that's what's
interesting for me but sometimes it does
get really really fast-paced so if you
can't multitask well this probably isn't
the job for you I answered a couple of
these questions already
sanitation questions did you get annoyed
having to wear a full face of makeup
every day no and I think that if you get
annoyed having to wear a full face of
makeup every day then Mac isn't the job
for you people that work at Mac makeup
is our passion I love putting on a full
face of makeup it's like my canvas
forget to literally create any kind of
look and it's also really fun because
this a lot of the times it's not
something that I would just wear out on
the town for a day so you get to really
go crazy and experiment
and just I don't know it's it's really
creative and that's the part that I love
about doing makeup Sammy Davis says what
makeup did you wear to your interview
did you bring a portfolio / can you show
us a little bit of it if you do so to
the actual interview I wore like a matte
brown smokey eye diva I basically did
like a dark vampy look because that's
what I feel like I'm most comfortable in
don't do something that is out of your
comfort zone go with what is you and be
able to point out if she asked like oh
what's on your eyes today even if you
didn't use Mac products you need to be
ready to say what Mac product you did
use so if she or a customer or something
asked like oh what's on your eyes or
what's on your lips just make it up go
with it be like oh this is Mac Brown
script and this is Mac diva even if
that's not what it is just because it is
an interview you're not there to sell
Kat Von D you're there to sell Mac did
you bring a portfolio
I didn't bring a portfolio I know other
Mac interviews do it a lot differently
sometimes it's like a really intense
group interview where you sit down and
you bring your portfolio and things like
that
so if you get to the point where you get
an interview I would just ask the
manager or whoever's interviewing you
should I bring a portfolio it's better
to ask than to show up and not have a
portfolio already answered a lot of
these Kaylee Jordan 18 says is it a
really stressful job I guess it depends
on what stresses you out in my opinion
it can get a little bit stressful you
know depending on your location again we
have a really really busy small mac
location so it does get it pretty
crammed in pretty stressful at times but
like I said if you're not down for like
a high paced work environment then
probably shouldn't work at Mac this one
is from Kendall's pics or Kendall ray on
YouTube shout it to my girl Kendall says
what are the dumbest things people ask
you when they shop haha sorry you know
this is my personality and I have to
know dumbest things people ask you have
had people come and like try to return
to do fix lotion or something with like
sour cream in it just like weird
like that that people think they can get
away with you don't want to like
send them but you have to be like yo
this is sour cream trying to think of
other moments Oh sometimes people will
walk in and be like hey is this Sephora
or they'll ask like oh do you guys have
that famous Kat Von D lipstick no but we
do have 500 famous MAC lipsticks a lot
of the times people ask like what the
difference is between Mac and
bareMinerals
I don't judge people based on how much
they know about makeup but there
definitely have been some interesting
questions that have been asked Hannah
bag I gotta some things as what's the
best thing about working at Mac I always
tell people that working at Mac doesn't
really feel like working to me I also
just like being able to like express
yourself and wear whatever you want and
act however you want one that you can't
act however you want there is just like
a fun work environment and a good group
of people that usually work at Mac if I
didn't get to your question it's just
because I have to stop filming and go to
work now the questions are still coming
on in on Instagram but if I didn't
answer your question leave it down below
and I will write a response to you we
can talk I just want to say that if you
are talented at makeup have a passion
for makeup and it's what you love I
would say go for it never hurts to apply
for me Mac is the perfect place to work
and love being able to wear a full face
of makeup I love being able to wear all
black clothes to it anyways on a daily
basis Ben have tattoos you can have
crazy hair colors it's just an awesome
place to work I literally have nothing
bad to say about the Matt community all
of my coworkers are awesome my managers
are awesome I've had zero bad
experiences so far I just think it's a
really great job and if you're
interested in it go for it so I hope
that was helpful for you and answered
some of your guys's questions if you
