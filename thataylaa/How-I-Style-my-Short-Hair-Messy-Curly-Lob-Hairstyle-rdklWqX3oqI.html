11 inches of my hair about tons of
questions about how I style it so I
figured I would show you guys today
I usually just wear it curly like 99% of
time so if you want to see how I get
this look right please alright so I
started out with damp hair just getting
out of the showers and what my hair
looks like first I like to go and I
think we protect in this is the get
eated by isla and I mentioned this in my
favorites video it smells so dang good
if you're gonna be using Hot Tools you
always want to go in with a heat
protectant so I just spray this all over
kind of run it through with my fingers
then I'm taking this oil by a salon and
this just helps to like smooth
everything out all the products I'm
using will be linked down below by the
way I just like to put this on the ends
of my hair you don't want to get this on
a root since it is an oil I'm gonna be
brushing through my hair and then I just
go in and blow-dry I have a weird method
for blow-drying that works with my hair
I'm super thick coarse hair and this is
just the best quickest way for me to
blow-dry my hair I don't have a fancy
hair dryer I literally just use this $15
Revlon dryer from TJ Maxx I've been
using this for a couple years now and I
love it
super easy to hold I like getting travel
sized because I feel like they're easier
to work with when I put it on my hair
this way it takes me about 10 minutes to
get my whole head of hair completely dry
and not this long it takes them usually
about twenty-five so I feel like this
works for me you do you so to get this
curly look I actually use a straightener
to curl my hair so be sure you guys how
I do that my favorite fully grills
trainers by Bombay hair
it literally heats up in about 60
seconds and it shows you as it's going
up and then it turns green when is ready
I've been using the straightener for
almost three years now hands down best
straightener have ever used I do have a
discount code for Bombay so link that
below here's the CVS defend the thermal
protectant sprays is another
Spray and I just like to put this all
over my suit hair super shiny and it
protects against the heat so I'm gonna
part my hair and section it off I have
enough hair for like ten human beings so
I've just sectioned off three different
times when I stay on my hair so this is
my bottom section I'm just flipping it
up and then I'm gonna go in with the
straightener
so curling your hair with a straightener
takes some practice not gonna lie but
once you get it it's super easy I take
about one-inch sections and first go
over it just to smooth out something
like the frizzies and then you can start
curling so the best tip I have for this
is curling away from your face so the
actual girl should go outwards instead
of towards your face for this look with
short hair you want to start curling
right at the base of your skull
basically right when you can turn the
straightener and then I like to leave
the end straight it just helps make it
look a little more edgy and messy and
not so much like ringlet curls and as
you can see I'm letting go about an inch
or two away from the bottom to keep it a
little bit straight so you're gonna have
to hold the straightener differently
depending on the side of the face you're
on in both cases the head of the
straightener will be pointed down before
you go in with heat if you've never curl
with your hair with a straightener
before I recommend just keeping me
straightener off and playing around with
it you'll see the best ways to hold it
and kind of how to position your arms
and then you can turn on the heat and go
to town most important thing is to keep
moving you don't want to hold the heat
in one spot because you're literally
gonna fry off your hair if you want an
extra edgy messy look you can try
alternating directions that you're
turning it once you get towards the back
of your head but you definitely want to
turn away from your face
in front of your face after each layer I
go in with hairspray I used a dove hair
spray it's like a light flexible hold
hairspray not every piece is gonna be
perfect and that's totally fine because
we're going for like a messy wavy curly
look so now I'm sectioning off another
player and I'm basically just gonna be
doing the same thing for the rest of my
head so I just go away from my face
curling right at the base will help give
a little bit of volume so you definitely
want to turn the straightener as soon as
you can
for me attempting to get the back of my
head is kind of a struggle I basically
just go around to the back and attempt
to curl it sometimes it's easier if you
pull it over to the side and act like
you're just doing the side of your head
like I'm doing here going back in with
hairspray you can never have enough
hairspray in your life all right since
my hair is super thick my hair holds a
curl pretty easily if you have thinner
hair you might want to spray before and
after you curl so when I do the front
section of my hair the last layer I like
to flip my bangs over and do them last
so literally going in doing the same
thing if it looks like too much of a
ringlet curl we're gonna go in
afterwards and mess it up a little bit
so don't worry just let it chill there
my hair doesn't get super oily at all so
when I wear this hairstyle I usually
wear it for
ah I have a whole video on my
experience getting the laws and all that
so link that a little I in the corner
and down below but if you're thinking
about getting short hair just keep in
mind that is a lot more work than it
seems like just because I do have to
style it every single day since I can't
just put it up into a ponytail I do love
it though it's growing on me so this is
what it looks like after I curl now I'm
gonna go in and to you since my hair is
super thick it does not hold the tease
at all but I still go in just to add a
little bit of texture I spray first and
then use a teasing comb to go in tease
or we say cheese again and then what
I'll do is go through the ends of my
hair and add a little bit of tease again
this just adds some texture and a little
bit of volume I would definitely
recommend doing this if you have thinner
hair than I do
so now just run your hand through pull
your fingers through the curls to loosen
them up a little bit and just get it to
look how you like it if you like tighter
curls keep it like that if you like
looser curls than I do you can just keep
running your fingers through and break
it up a little bit and then of course
going in for a final spray so this is
what the final look looks like I hope
you guys like this video if it was
helpful for you give it a thumbs up so I
know again I'll link all of my hair
