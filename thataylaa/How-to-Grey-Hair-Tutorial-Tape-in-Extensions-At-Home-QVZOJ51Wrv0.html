you guys how I got gray hair I'm
actually filming this intro a couple
weeks after I film the rest of this
video so my hair has faded since the
footage that you're gonna see I'm gonna
try and make this intro super brief
because if you're landed on this video
you probably don't care you probably
just want to know how to get gray hair
but the information I might tell you
right now is important so don't fast
forward the results that you get depend
on where you're starting from
I had box black hair for over ten years
just in the last four months I've
started to lighten my hair to get it to
silver I'm not quite too silver yet I'm
at this gray shade but I actually really
like this gray shade matter what hair
color you have naturally or colored you
have to lighten your hair to a pale
yellow shade before you can put any kind
of gray color on top if your hair isn't
light enough it's just not going to show
up don't even try trust me I've tried
you're not going to get gray hair
without having your hair light enough to
begin with so what that means is that if
you're starting with dark you're gonna
have to bleach it to get it light
throughout the lightening process I did
not do that myself going from black to
blonde is a really intense process I
have two videos documenting my process
I'm gonna link those down below so I'm
not going to go in-depth about that at
all just know that you have to lighten
your hair before putting grey on so I do
have tape in extensions in right now my
hair naturally is about this short this
is a piece of natural hair super short
I've had to cut off a lot throughout the
whole process but I also just like short
hair I did want to add a little bit of
volume and length so major shout out to
rob Beauty Christie Christie is who
helped me throughout this whole thing
you guys will see her in the video I
could not have done this without her
especially the tape and extensions so
we're going to be showing you guys how
to do the grey at home and also put in
your own tape and extensions it is
easier if you have a second person to
help you out the reason I went with tape
and extensions over clip in extensions
is just for my lifestyle I just don't
picture myself clipping in extensions
every single day now that I've had the
tape and extensions in for a little over
two weeks I can say that I love them
there really isn't anything negative I
can think of as we said hers lasts for
about three to four months it's
basically just as soon as you get that
hair growth and they start
a little bit more just literally remove
them they are full-on in like I could
tug on my hair right now I don't have to
worry about anything falling out the
only thing you have to worry about is
the tape showing you can get tape that
matches your hair color but since we had
to start with a pale blonde shade of
extensions and color them darker gray my
tape color is like a white shade so I
just have to make sure that my hair is
fully covering it it isn't really an
issue unless it's like super windy and
my hair is blown everywhere but you can
sleep on it totally fine they're totally
flat so unless someone is like massaging
your head they're not going to feel them
if you place them and cut them right I
feel like they can look super natural
Kristy also cut mine I could not have
cut them myself so if you have a friend
who can cut them or maybe you want to
put them in yourself and then go to a
salon to have them cut them that could
work super happy with him super happy
with the results of everything Thank You
Kristy Kristy was seriously a lifesaver
I'll leave her channel link down below
you guys should go check her out she
does like insane special effects makeup
super talented she's a good friend of
mine on YouTube lover go subscribe I
think that's everything I had to tell
you if you are new here you can join the
baby doe family and subscribe it'll
notify you every single time and put up
a new video so if you want to see how I
got gray hair and puttin tape and
extensions at home you're in the right
place just keep watching so when I left
the salon this last time this is what I
walked out of with pretty blonde change
is not gray or silver at all so I ended
up adding some stuff to my hair I
basically added like three different
things and I ended up with this
it is a shade of grey it just had so
many different colors in it that it was
hard to keep up with and I also didn't
like the root color they're like kind of
green as you can see but when I went
into Salon Christie I came out with this
so as you can see we added some length
also evened out the color and just got
everything a really nice deep grey shade
since I had so many different shades on
my hair and I wanted it just one tone
that was easy to keep up with and we
also had to match the extensions to my
hair we decided that it would be best
and easiest if we actually stripped the
color of my hair so everything that's in
my hair right now and it'll take it back
to the blonde shade that it was bleached
to at this lot when I was at this lawn I
knew that she got it to a pale yellow
shade so if we stripped this color we'd
be good to be back to the pale yellow if
you are also needing to strip color this
method worked really well this is what
Christie has done on her hair lots of
times we actually used vitamin C which
you can get at the drugstore and now I
would not recommend getting these
tablets you need to get the kind that
pop open and have liquid inside because
we literally sat here and crushed
freaking tablets for like four hours not
exaggerating you can get powdered
vitamin C already if you can find that
at a store near you buy just powder
vitamin C make sure it's straight
vitamin C not emergency or anything like
that I have super thick hair and I have
a lot of it so in my hair we ended up
using a whole bottle of vitamin C
crushed crush it really fine and then
mix it one to one with shampoo mix it up
really well and then you're just going
to fully saturate the hair we left it on
for about an hour but just check your
hair and you'll see it start to lift
once it's done and you feel like you're
ready to wash it out rinse it out and
then put some purple shampoo on there
just to tone out any brassiness and when
you rent it out it'll look something
like this so as you can see I am back to
the pale yellow blonde shade my roots
are actually pink hair it was hard to
see on camera but the roots turned up
straight up pink and pretty sure that
was from the joy coke color that I put
on them I've read that that can lift
really weird when you try and remove
color or bleach it so here's the pink
roots just so you guys can see I was
totally fine with a darker like shadow
root so I wasn't super concerned about
that we were just going to figure it out
once we got there so after I dried my
hair this is what my hair looks like now
my hair is super damaged because I've
been bleaching it for months now I know
you don't have to tell me my hair
bounces back pretty quick though and I
use old Plex and all that good stuff so
don't worry now we're going to go in
with the gray and for this I use the
wellö 250 you can get this from Sally's
and we're just going to mix this with 20
volume developer one to two well its
developer just follow instructions on
the box and apply like you normally
would all over the hair you want to make
sure every inch is covered we decided to
first put the toner everywhere even on
the roots just to see how it turned and
then if the roots were still a weird
color then we would figure it out but
luckily when I rinsed everything out
this is what we got it to so super cool
like blueish gray it looks different in
every lighting but I love the way the
roots turned out they actually turned
out a really nice ashy dark gray
brownie shade actually really like the
roots and the rest of it was exactly the
color I was hoping for so now we're
going to go in with the extensions so
I'm gonna show you how we colored these
and then actually put them in and
blended them to match my hair and look
like real hair so I'm Anna from VP
fashion these are the exact style number
I'm gonna link them down below I also
have a discount code for you guys this
isn't sponsored by VP fashion this is
just the extensions that I chose to try
out I went with these because they're
known to be good for coloring and like
fun fashion colors and stuff a lot of
extensions are treated with stuff that
just turns it weird colors and these
ones are supposed to be like really good
for coloring so when you get them the
6:13 a comes in this pale yellow shade
actually cut some of them off to start
because I knew I didn't want to have to
waste color on ends that wasn't going to
need if you're going to be coloring tape
and extensions just try and look out for
the tape you obviously don't want to get
the tape wet before you stick them in
your hair it just won't hold as well so
I just used a rubber glove and wrapped a
ponytail around there kind of just keep
the water out a little bit if you have
any better methods let me know down
below this is just what I did so the
first thing I did and you can also do
this if you want silver rather than gray
is just use a purple shampoo put a ton
on there and really work it through and
purple shampoo just totally tones out
that yellow
I actually recommend the Pravana purple
shampoo over this one this is like the
cheap Sally's one but the Pravana one is
amazing I used it on clip-in extensions
and it worked way better but this worked
I mean it just toned out the yellow and
turned it to like more of a gray tone as
you can see here's after so huge
difference just with literally purple
shampoo I'm just gonna summarize this
part for you because I would not
recommend doing this basically what I
did was put on the joy Co color which
was a mistake it turned them like
straight-up blue which is what you're
seeing here this is actually after we
stripped the color using that same
vitamin C mixture so if you get these
extensions just go straight to the well
ot 50 after the purple shampoo don't put
anything else on them so we're literally
doing the same thing we did test strands
on my hair by the way and the extensions
before we put any of this on and when we
did the test strand on the extension and
held it up to my real hair it looked
like almost a perfect match so doing the
exact same thing that we did to my hair
just mixing one to two Wella - developer
here's a good tip because Christie's a
genius and I never thought of this
before but if you want to measure really
easily use that same toner bottle for
your developer because it'll give the
exact amount when you're trying to
measure out developer and toner so if
you're using two bottles of toner you're
going to need four bottles of developer
if you're using three bottles you'll
need six bottles of developer because
it's a one to two ratio so then you're
just going to fully saturate the
extensions just paint them on flip it
over these extensions are super thick so
make sure that you really get in there
we kept finding patches of like dry hair
even after we thought it was completely
saturated so just really work it in with
your fingers and the brush and move
around the hair and make sure all those
patches are covered we want to get as
close as you can to the tape without
trying to get it wet because you
obviously don't want like blonde peeking
through at the top it's kind of tricky
we actually got a couple of them wet but
the inside ones were totally fine so we
left the toner on for about 20 minutes
you'll see it start to turn colors rinse
it out and then just dry it so now we're
going to go in to the actual tape in
process Christy puts her tape ins in
herself so it is possible but if you
have a friend who can help you out it'll
make your life a lot easier especially
if this is the first time that you're
doing this we're going to peel off the
tape and then just place your comb right
directly below the tape so that's kind
of sticking to it and it'll just help
hold it in there you're going to want to
section off your hair starting at about
the top of your ear and when you choose
pieces of hair to actually apply the
extensions to make sure you get a really
fine amount of hair I got better shots
in a second so sorry this is like cut
out but basically you're going to
sandwich two extensions together so once
you put that one on the bottom of your
real hair now we're going to sandwich it
with one on the top you want to place
them about half an inch away from your
root so it's not too uncomfortable or
anything and here she is just putting
that one on the top and just pressing
down really good to secure it the reason
why you want to choose a really really
tiny amount of hair is so that the tape
is actually sticking to the tape on
either side if you have too much hair in
there it doesn't have anything to stick
to when placing the tape you obviously
want to put it places that are going to
be covered by other hair so you don't
want to stick one leg right
of your ear because there's not gonna be
anything to cover that so basically just
find the spots that are more sparse and
that you can like blend in with your
hair section it off like we're doing
here and then get really fine them out
and then you're just going to keep
applying the tape in the same way you
can kind of take down the clip and see
where everything is falling if you need
to figure out where to place your next
piece of tape but Chris you just kind of
like worked her way from bottom to top
here's a better shot of how much hair
she actually used and how she's placing
the tape you can see that you can
totally see the tape through it so you
really just want the smallest amount of
hair and then use your finger to press
down and make sure everything's secured
and then just take out that comb your
hair is gonna look really long and
ridiculous and not blend it at all until
you go in and cut it so that's okay it's
gonna look pray for a little bit Kristi
said hers lasts for about three to four
months you can use the same hair you two
literally just remove it with like
alcohol and then you can replace the
hair so you don't have to buy new
extensions every four months you just
use the same ones you can wash your hair
the same try not to place product
directly on them like oils or anything
because that will just loosen the tape a
little bit but otherwise do everything
normal so here we go looking like
Rapunzel as you can see you can see my
short hair on the top it's not blended
in at all which is why you have to cut
it to a length that still is going to
look natural so if you have naturally
super short hair you'll probably have to
go about my length if your hair is
naturally longer than mine you can go
longer with the extensions because it's
just going to blend better I have no
idea what Kristi is doing here so I'm
not even gonna attempt to explain Kristi
cuts her own hair too
I don't know how she does it but she's a
boss by the way it was literally 3:00
a.m. at this point so major props to
Kristi for being a trouper and finishing
my hair color wise I feel like the
extensions and my real hair matched
pretty dang well when she was done
cutting we just curled my hair and then
this is the final result super happy
with it I think Kristi did freaking
incredible Chrissy's not a licensed hair
professional at all she just has learned
all this and I just think it looks
amazing
better than any time I've ever gone to a
salon I love
I think she totally killed it I would do
this whole process again recommend it to
you guys I want to you still using the
t-50 to color my hair when I need it so
here's a little before-and-after for you
everyone loves it before and after okay
so that is how I got my gray hair I did
want to say that this color phase
extremely fast since it is a toner it
isn't a color so it's not going to stay
on like a color even like a
demi-permanent color to keep up with the
color I've been using either the
fanciful true steel wash which is
literally a wash out color so if you're
going to be like going in the rain or
something don't put it in but you just
put it in with wet hair blow-dry it it
stays on until you wash it next time
that's a good option but it's super
temporary literally washes out another
option which I love these is a celeb
luxury color rinse I mixed the silver
shade with the pastel lavender I'm going
to link the exact ones down below along
with everything else I used in this
video but those are freaking amazing
they're actually colored depositing
shampoos awesomely to keep up with any
hair color really they literally just
deposit color every time you wash your
hair with them those have been a
lifesaver or else my hair would be like
actually blonde Brown right now hope
