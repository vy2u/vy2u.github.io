Antarctica right now almost wore the
leopard rope in this video we're
refraining so I'm really excited to
finally be filming this video this is
something that I get a ton of questions
about and I've never made a full video
dedicated to I want to start doing more
like how to grow on YouTube and just
YouTube Help videos I think there's a
ton of people out there who think about
starting a YouTube channel and just
don't know where to start and don't know
how to grow and don't really know how to
navigate this world I've been doing
YouTube for almost four years now three
active years of making videos one year I
was abroad and couldn't record videos so
I'm just gonna go through my background
on YouTube a little bit how I prioritize
and manage my time and how you can also
have a full time career and do YouTube
there just to give a little bit of
background I started YouTube when I was
in college as a full time college
student I would do YouTube after class
when I probably should have been
studying and I would edit videos on the
weekend or edit them whenever I had time
throughout the week in YouTube in
college was a lot easier just because of
the way that your classes are kind of
spaced out so fast forwarding a few
years I graduated college Wow it was
almost two years ago it'll be two years
in June moved up to Seattle started a
full-time internship which turns into a
full-time job now I have a full-time
career at a digital marketing agency I
work 40 hours a week there was
definitely a point for a solid year and
a half when I was working more like 50
hours a week at a startup so
prioritizing time and making time for
YouTube is not an easy thing I think my
number one kind of point of this is that
whether it's YouTube or blogging or
starting a podcast whatever it is if
you're gonna be investing so much of
your time in something outside of your
already full time forty hour week job
you have to love it you have to
be invested in it you have to be
passionate about it and it has to be
something you enjoy doing and you have
to be in it for the right reasons if
you're starting youtube today because
you want to make money it's gonna take
you a solid at least two years before
you make any kind of significant money
from YouTube so you can't go into it
thinking that you're gonna start it to
make money for me it is still a hobby
it's still a passion it could be a
full-time job for me right now but I
just I'm workaholic and I have other
career goals for myself so I don't know
if I'll ever do youtube full-time I
think I might if I was I would be
investing my time
a lot of other things I don't currently
have time for but it is possible to put
up two to three videos just like full
time youtubers do well you have another
job so if you're doing this because
you're passionate about it then you're
gonna have to really figure out how to
manage your time and prioritize time for
YouTube everyone has the same amount of
hours in the day it's how you choose to
spend those hours it's going to
determine whether you succeed on YouTube
and can put out consistent content or
you just don't and you keep making
excuses and you don't put up content
because you're busy everyone is busy
even full-time youtubers that busy if
you have another full-time job on top of
that you're extra busy and you're gonna
have to figure out how to prioritize
your time so I would start by going
through your schedule figuring out when
are your big chunks of free time for me
that Saturday and Sunday those are my
two weekend days I work Monday through
Friday so on Saturday and Sunday
those are my dedicated YouTube filming
and editing days and yeah that's the
weekend and the reality of it is a lot
of the times I don't have a weekend I'm
filming two to three videos and then
also editing those two to three videos
so I basically get a week's worth of
YouTube work done in two days to be
completely honest sometimes sometimes
that's hard sometimes you're sacrificing
your social life or you're sacrificing
hanging out with people or meeting
people and doing other things for me
it's how I choose to spend my time so I
wouldn't be doing this if it's something
that I didn't genuinely enjoy I want to
keep up with my personality is just to
go all-in on something I'm like black
and white with everything like if I'm
working out I'm full-on working out or
I'm not doing anything while I carve out
Saturday and Sunday at the same time I
make sure that I completely turn off at
about 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. every day during
the week so sometimes I'll have to get a
video up and I'll be working on the
description box or scheduling things
there doing social promotion or whatever
it is and I make sure that all of that
is done by 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. so I can
actually relax and not be like
completely overworked and killing myself
so once you figure it out kind of you're
free days and you're free hours it might
not be a whole day whatever it is you
need to set a schedule make that your
dedicated filming day my roommate knows
Saturday warning there is no going to
coffee there's no going to brunch it is
all about filming and I think when
you're doing that trying to be smart
about the content that you're filming it
obviously depends on the kind of content
you put out but for me
since i film makeup beauty related
videos mostly i already know i'm gonna
have to get ready for a video I might as
well film it and turn that into another
video so today I filmed a shadowy
schmooze on this look now I'm filming
this video also along the lines of
content you're gonna have to majorly
plan in advance the kind of content that
you're putting out because all of my
videos are a couple weeks pre recorded
and edited I have to think advance for
when I'm gonna be able to film a January
Raisin rejects or video with a brand or
things like that where I can't just
randomly decide I'm gonna film it one
day after I have it figure out ahead of
time so I can actually make that
deadline and get that video up on time
getting something like a planner or
calendar where you can just write out
your videos really helps have a running
list of video ideas and I'll kind of go
through and like prioritize them so
social channels keeping up with your
social channels is super important for
YouTube I try and take as many Instagram
photos on the weekend as I can you can
use tools like HootSuite to schedule
tweets I never really do that cuz I just
like tweet in the moment you know but
you can just get your like captions and
everything already typed out and notes
have your pictures ready to go and then
just post it throughout the week I'm not
takin like makeup photos throughout the
week or product photos or anything
mostly so any of the Instagram photos
that are going out throughout the week
are usually 9 out of 10 times taken on
the weekend my next tip is use your
break time when most people are taking
breaks you're gonna be working so you're
gonna have to get used to that on my
breaks at work or at lunch or whatever
I am tweeting and responding in the
comments I am posting on Instagram doing
all the kind of maintenance stuff that
does add up and does take time obviously
car rides plane trips any of that kind
of thing we're gonna have a chunk of
time get everything prepared so you can
spend that time editing or posting or
whatever it is so while I have a
schedule for myself for filming and
editing to relieve some of the stress I
don't make a video schedule I don't say
I'm gonna be putting out videos every
Monday Wednesday Friday for me if I had
to
set schedule it would stress me the
out if I couldn't get a video up that
way you also don't have to make excuses
to your followers when you don't get a
video up I've never promised that so you
guys don't expect that in return
obviously I try to put up two to three
videos every week sometimes those weeks
where there's three or four or I do a
live stream sometimes those weeks
whether it's 2 or 1 I rarely do one
video you can usually get to up a week
but not having that promised set
schedule really helps me personally so
if that's something that stresses you
out maybe try getting rid of the
schedule people are still gonna watch
people are still gonna love you as long
as you're putting out videos at some
point my next tip is don't make excuses
whether you do YouTube
full-time or if this is your side thing
while you work full-time don't make
excuses either do it or don't do it you
have to be all in it if this is
something that you want to be a
successful ID and if you can't get up a
video or if you can't whatever like I
have 10 things working against me health
issues work time all this stuff just
don't complain about it either do it or
don't do it people are gonna watch you
for you and the quality of your videos
and the consistency is a few of those
things going for you just do you
everything in your life is a choice so
if you choose to go all-in on YouTube
you owe it to yourself and your
followers to follow through with that
this is my choice I choose to work two
full time essentially jobs that's
something that I choose to do because I
love both of them if I didn't love both
of them I wouldn't be doing them whether
you're thinking about starting a YouTube
channel or you already have and you're
having trouble managing your time or
getting out videos or whatever it is I
think you just have to realize that
you're doing it because you love it
you're not doing it because one day you
want to have 500,000 subscribers or
whatever it is you're not doing it
because you want to make money anything
that you're doing in your life that
takes a huge chunk of your time you
should be doing it because you love it I
think seeing that it is possible helps
and also like someone that I really look
up to is pretty shiny sparkly he's an
anesthesiologist and she also has a blog
and she does YouTube and consistently
puts out videos so it is possible it's a
choice it's how you choose to spend your
time you're your own boss and I think
recognizing that is really important
there's no one telling you that you have
to get your videos up there's no one
telling you to schedule stuff for social
or to respond to emails or
this back-end stuff you're your own boss
and you're gonna have to prioritize your
time and make it happen if you want it
to happen so that's probably a super
long video I hope that was helpful for
some of you who are having trouble
prioritizing your time and doing this or
if you're just thinking about starting
YouTube but having a job is kind of
roadblock for you it is possible living
proof and I just want to say a huge
thank you to all of you guys because
really all of your support and comments
and everything is what motivates me a
lot of the time caring positive feedback
really does push me and help me continue
what I'm doing and keep going you guys
