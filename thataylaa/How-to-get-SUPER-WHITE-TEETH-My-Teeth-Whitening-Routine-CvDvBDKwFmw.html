like cutely posing with Birkin LED light
in their mouth where have you been
alright so today we're going to be
talking about how I get these babies
white first time I've had a spray tan on
in literally three years definitely had
like a Ross for a friend situation
happen where I didn't turn so I have
like a zebra stripe down the side of my
body that's good so probably one of my
most asked questions is how I like my
teeth how I keep my teeth white with all
the coffee I drink so we're going to
talk about all that finally today I'm
excited so I'm a big coffee drinker
which coffee can stain your teeth wine
stains your teeth so if you are a coffee
drinker or anything like that I would
definitely recommend using the products
and we talked about so the first thing I
do is brush my teeth obviously twice a
day I use the Colgate optic white
toothpaste I've mentioned this before on
my channel this is like my favorite
whitening toothpaste I use the crest 3d
white for years and in my opinion this
one is so much better I feel like I
actually noticed a difference with this
stuff and it does help to remove like
the surface stains I feel like I don't
think a whitening toothpaste is going to
like dramatically whiten your teeth but
just for day-to-day whitening I feel
like it definitely helps to remove the
surface stains I can lie this one tastes
pretty shitty the crest one definitely
tastes better than the Colgate one so if
you're like really into toothpaste being
like minty and enjoyable this is not
either of those says whiter teeth in one
week I actually think the Express
version of this if you can find it I
think I've seen on Amazon that one works
a lot better I just had this one I
couldn't find the Express version at the
drugstore by me but if you can find that
one or order it on Amazon I feel like I
like that one a little bit better than
this one we're like everything like
always in the description box down below
next thing I do is go in with actual
teeth whitening and I feel like you
always see tons of tanned red stuff
floating around Instagram and YouTube I
can't tell you how many brands I've
tried out and then I haven't moved
forward with because they didn't like
the product you
now I only talk about and recommend
stuff that I genuinely love and I've
tried out if it's a horrible product at
the end of the day that looks better on
me so I'm not going to recommend
something that I don't genuinely believe
in so rightist I'll reach out to me to
collaborate on a video so I'm gonna
trying this guy out for a while now you
guys have seen on snapchat and I think
it's an awesome affordable option for
teeth whitening the past I've used
whitening trays from the dentists which
work awesome but they are pretty freakin
pricey you guys can get this whole white
with style things that I'm about to talk
about for 28 bucks with the coupon code
the taillow which is a pretty dang good
deal so this is all the stuff that it
comes with super easy to use you
basically get these little trays and you
boil them in water until they get kind
of soft and like malleable ooh that's a
good word malleable and then what you do
is you stick them in your mouth you kind
of press them against your teeth to get
that shape and then drop them in cold
water when you're satisfied with the
shape honestly that was the only
difficult part for me I don't think I
got my water hot enough so I had to do
it a few times where I actually got the
shape right for my mouth but once you
actually get like the teeth marks in
there and it fits your mouth nicely you
want to trim around the gum line hold
you a teeth whitening is that you
actually want to get it on your teeth
not your gums
go figure because when you put whitening
product on your gums they will burn I've
had it happen with the stuff from the
dentist I've had it happen with Crest
Whitestrips if you have sensitive teeth
you'll want to leave it on for less time
than they say you want to make sure
you're trimming the tray close enough to
your gum line where when you put it in
your mouth the whitening product if
there's any that comes up on the top you
can wipe it off so it doesn't get on
your gums if you don't trim it close
enough it's just going to be chilling in
there in this tray on your gums so they
give you the top in the bottom tray here
my bottom one looks like freaking mini
you put them in at the same time you can
do it one night the top one at the
bottom I usually just do it at the same
time because why not usually sports and
Gellin put the tray in and then you just
go in with this guy and this is just an
LED light so it basically helps to they
could go faster so you just put it
around and go got then you just chill
there and leave it on for thirty minutes
I use my whitening trays I usually just
put on a face mask chill watch them
YouTube videos for a half hour my bottom
teeth have always been super hard to
whiten and I feel like actually I'm a
trying talk
like this has actually helped to whiten
the bottom which is usually really hard
to do for me bullying white with style
and description box down below along
with the coupon code that you can use to
get it for 28 bucks which is pretty much
the same price as like Crest Whitestrips
so I feel like it's worth a try also
look at this freaking bag like I just
love their packaging and branding and
everything alright so the last step in
my whitening routine is using a
whitening mouthwash I stick with the
Colgate brand this is a Colgate optic
white
I see fresh mint flavor this is a lot
more refreshing and like minty than the
toothpaste this stuff legit works I use
this pretty much every single night if
I'm using the whitening trays at night I
don't typically use this just because I
don't want to like irritate my teeth
basically or my gums whenever I start to
see my teeth getting a little bit too
yellow again I just go in with the trays
use them like two times a week and then
I usually go a few weeks without using
them at all you could use them as much
as you want but that's just what I do
again you can find this on Amazon if you
don't have it in a drugstore by you but
I just feel like this actually
works so that's basically it super quick
video this is just what I do and what
works for me let me know your guys's
favorite whitening products down below
in the comment section love you guys
thanks for watching and see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
