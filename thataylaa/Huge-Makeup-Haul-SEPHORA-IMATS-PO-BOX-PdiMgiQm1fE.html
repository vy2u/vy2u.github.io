down and put on a quick wing liner and
then this happened happen anyone else I
didn't film a tutorial on this look but
let me know if you guys want to see it
actually I like the way it turned out I
feel like when I just play around with
makeup those other looks that turn out
the best because there's no like
pressure while the cameras on you know
I'm saying okay I have a ton of
stuff to show you guys today this is
gonna be a huge makeup haul I went a
little crayon Sephora I have the makeup
that I bought from IMAX to show you guys
and I feel like this lash glue is like
glue to my bottom wash I have yet to
find the lash glue that doesn't burn my
eyes I've tried latex free lash glue
I've tried every kind of lash glue you
guys have super sensitive eyes let me
know if you found a good one this is
also going to be some stuff that came in
my p.o box because there's some cool
 in here that I think you guys don't
like to see let's start out with Sephora
I just put up a whole Sephora hacks
video so if you want to see how I save
money shopping on Sephora I'll leave
that link in the description box below
it's always so deceiving how tiny the
box looks yet you hash out your entire
wallet so it was double cash back for
Sephora on Ebates and whenever it's
double cash back on ebay I go to town
because it's like free money you don't
know what you miss is I mentioned it
before but they're one of my favorite
sites that I use to shop online and save
money okay
this lash oh yeah all right we'll deal
with that after what were we talking
about he bathes basically they give you
cash back every single time you shop
online I've been using them for years
I've mentioned them for years and I love
them if you haven't use you base before
it's free to sign up and then when you
spend your first twenty-five dollars on
a site you get a free ten dollar gift
card which is freaking sweet if you're a
mobile shopper then you can use the app
I personally like to use desktop that's
just how I shop online but there is an
app anyways so it was double cashback on
a Sephora I think right now it's Macy's
and JC Penney or something you can still
get makeup on Macy's Le Blanc for eBay's
in the description box below if you want
to use it flush sign up I have a ton of
stuff in here so I'm on a mission this
year to hit VIP Rouge which I feel like
it's a bad life goal because that
basically means you're spending a
thousand dollars so like always you get
free samples on Sephora so these are
just perfume samples and then the primer
oil by Smashbox which I'm actually
excited to try
is a really interesting concept of
primer oil I feel like that's the
opposite of what you usually think of
when you think of primers I'm curious to
see if this gives like a super dry matte
foundation a more luminous finish so
basically after I posted my nighttime
skincare routine I got a ton of comments
about products that you guys recommend
and products that I shouldn't be using
on my face and all this stuff if you've
been following me for a while you know
that I have cystic acne majorly it went
away for like a good six months and I
made a whole how I got rid of acne video
and then it freakin came back so I am
trying to figure out the best products
to use on my skin again it has been such
a struggle I've basically been tossing
out all the old stuff I was using trying
new things trying anything to clear this
up and a lot of you guys said to try the
first aid beauty line I've heard people
talk about first aid beauty for years I
don't know why that they just never like
appeal to me so many of you guys have
snapped me and tweeted me saying that I
have to try first aid beauty so this is
the skin rescue deep cleanser with red
clay is this a gel cleanser that's ideal
for combo oily skin it contains red clay
rosemary leaf oil and botanical
antioxidants so well this is not a cheap
face wash I usually go for like
drugstore skin products but I feel like
I'm doing something wrong and I'm
willing to try out anything right now
and skincare is one of those things that
is worth the investment because it's
your skin when your skin looks should be
the rest of your makeup look shitty
which is what's really annoying to me
like my foundation has just been sitting
so crappy on my skin lately because I'm
breaking out so horribly everywhere wow
this thing is like glued on smells very
minty
like peppermint tea kind of so while
we're on this thin care for say beauty
thing I got the facial radiance pads
which are basically like toning pads
that use after you wash your face before
your moisturizer you guys know Holy
Grail Neutrogena stress control toner
that's like one of my favorite products
ever
but someone commented saying that it has
a ton of alcohol in it and I looked it
up and it does so I don't know that's
one of those things that I feel like was
working for my skin and I don't know if
it's just making it worse in the long
run I don't know so I'm trying out these
they're alcohol free and safe for
sensitive skin ooh my nail polish
matches these are pricey for 60 pads I
think these
yeah for 60 pads it was $30 holy crap
so these better be good okay something
that I am super excited about is the
brand new Lancome tint Idol ultra makeup
stick so I have the Lancome 24-hour
normal liquid foundation I haven't done
a whole dedicated review on it but I'm
pretty sure I've included it in a
shadowing shmoo the saw link that in the
downbar this is a new foundation stick I
love the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation stick so we're gonna see how
this compares let me know if you guys
want to see a full first impression
review or something on this I got the
shade 110 ivory I can't believe I got
this I've been resisting buying this for
a year now like ever since this came out
I don't know why this is the Kat Von D
shade in light contour palette so many
you guys have told me to try this out
for pale princesses and see how it is
whenever I saw this I feel like there's
not gonna be enough shades that work for
my skin tone to make it worth it but
then I figured I could use the other
ones for eyeshadows or use on other
people or whatever so I ended up caving
and I bought the Kat Von D shade and
light palette it just sucks that none of
these shades are light enough like I'm
not gonna be able to use these highlight
shades probably for anything this one
looks a little bit lighter but it
definitely has more warm tones in it and
then this one looks more cool I'm really
curious to see if this lives up to all
the hype this was a totally impulse buy
this is the NARS all day luminous powder
foundation so I've tried the all day
luminous liquid foundation I have a
whole review on it wasn't a huge fan of
the all day luminous I love the NARS
sheer glow foundation I do want an
illuminating powder
I like the a cosmetics celebration
foundation illumination but this shade
is a little bit too dark for me so I
want to try and find something that
works for my skin tone so that wow this
packaging is really nice it's like a
matte black and like all about this this
is in the shade Siberia ooh it looks
like it could be light enough well I
think it's just like inhaled some of
that powder this was not a cheap powder
I think this is like 30 something
dollars so we shall see if it's worth it
okay then I got the full size of the
Smashbox primer water vegan is I got a
sample size the sample size totally
worked
does that ever happen you guys like I
always think why do they throw
so many samples but they totally work I
had a sample size of this and I ended up
loving it I love wearing this under my
Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation it
makes you have a super pretty like glow
to your skin I don't think it actually
helps with making your makeup stay on
longer but I do think it helps with
making her skin look really healthy and
moisturized and glowy and it's silicone
free alcohol-free and oil free which is
really good if you have acne prone skin
if so the last thing I got at Sephora is
this which is already open because I've
worn it once and this is the Stila stay
all day liquid lipstick in karma
Camarillo car Murillo caramello totally
off Stila stay all day liquid lipsticks
are like my oh gee liquid lipsticks
these are amazing these are totally
underrated if you haven't tried these
yet you need to the formula is on point
they're long lasting not super drying
and they're honestly one of the best
this shade I think is new it is such a
pretty dusty nude rosy color I'm gonna
swatch it for you guys because we're
gonna be doing a lot of swatching later
there it is look at that color it is so
pretty when it dries down is fully matte
I just love these they smell like cake
Sephora done I'm not gonna swatch these
because I'm gonna be doing a whole
review on them but this is the NYX
lingerie liquid lipsticks I just wanted
to show you guys because these are brand
new so far really liking these spoiler
alert they're $7 and get him on Ulta now
they just started carrying it on an
altar before I was only on the next
website next thing which is super
exciting because my name is actually on
this this is the soul look I basis
palette and basically like I didn't have
any act and creating this or anything
but I do work closely with David the
owner I think he's the owner he included
my name on here which is so sweet so
there's my name
that's exciting here's the colors inside
super pretty I love this shape but if
you guys want to see a shadow schmooze
UMI's the first palette the gracias
palette was beautiful I love the shades
in there why are you flashing on the
camera okay so I have all the stuff I
gotta I mess in this little bag I didn't
actually go to crazy eye mask I was
pretty good I don't have that much
self-control it's mostly just because I
didn't want to wait in line so the first
thing I got is this fidelium tools brush
I haven't tried fidelium ever before
this was $12
this is the face 9
see a fresh reason why I got this is
because it is such an interesting shape
this flat and then tapers up it's such
an interesting shape I've never used a
foundation brush like this yeah it just
like sits really nicely on your face I
love to the yellow handle next thing I
got which I'm really excited about is
this pinky rose liquid lipsticks pinky
rose cosmetics this isn't a shade VIP
and I feel like this is one of those
brands that's gonna blow up this year I
just have a feeling they have liquid
lipsticks the ladies were super nice at
the booth I bought all the stuff with my
own money by the way they're a
California local store that thinks
they're based in Sacramento they're
liquid lipsticks look beautiful they're
fully freaking waterproof we swatch
these on our hands there and could not
get them off for the next like two days
these are like a long-lasting kind of
liquid lipsticks these aren't budging oh
man
I'm so excited to wear this look at this
shade and these dried down it's fully
matte I'm gonna have a hell of a time
getting this off my hand so I got to
violet Voss eyelashes that were just
totally escape from that for a second
just lay in I don't care these are made
of synthetic hairs and they're faux mink
lashes so they're supposed to look like
mink lashes but not be like $30
basically and I just think both these
look really nice I love the separated
kind of lashes by the way right now I'm
wearing these right now I'm wearing 126
by eyelure and found my eyelash for my
nuts never heard anything about this
brand either I think this is what IMS is
for like I don't want to wait in line
for two hours at brands that you can buy
online I feel like it's about
discovering the brands that no one talks
about yet and that are either
up-and-coming or just don't have the
recognition that they maybe deserve
powder blushes and I figured out just
put to use directly into my Z palette as
they are just pans but these are too
blush no one blush and one highlight
actually is by the brand it's the I
don't know if I said that the girl
totally talked me into this highly I was
just thinking at the blush because it
looked like NARS orgasm but this
highlight she swatch and it was like
incredible I think these were like under
$10 this is in the shade Barbados so
soft it's like a champagne Eagle look at
that glow I might as well swatch the
blush to sunshine and happiness
that's positive we handed of questioning
this now because this looks a lot warmer
than I typically like like a lot peach
year I got it Milani Luminoso side note
and I am not a fan of it on my skintone
Luminoso and it is like straight-up
orange so here's that blush let's blend
it out it might work it almost blends
more like pinky yeah I do you guys see
that looks like a nice like melon by the
way this part of my desk is clean right
now and then literally from the frame
right here over it is like a clusterfuck
of stuff is that really the last thing
like that Oh two more things from my
mattes
I was on a mission to find more white
foundation mixers for you guys to try
out this is a brand I've never heard of
either this is makeup design Marie HG
airbrush makeup but the guys thought
that it was totally fine to just mix in
on your own and I figured that since
you're putting it in an airbrush machine
it might be like very concentrated which
could be good I'm going to be doing a
whole video reviewing all of my white
mixers I've bought in like three new
ones in the past couple months to try
out that is coming this is the model and
a bottle lipstick sealer everyone knows
a model in a bottle before they're
setting spray which I haven't actually
ever tried but their lipstick sealer
really appealed to me this is basically
supposed to make any lipstick ever
waterproof and smudge-proof which is
like my problem with lipsticks and why I
only wear liquid lipsticks so if this
works it will basically solve all my
life's problems so that comes as tiny
little glass bottle nothing particularly
interesting it's like totally nail
polish bottle ooh smells very chemically
the last thing that I'm gonna show you
guys is all the stuff that came in my
peel box so Urban Decay was frickin
amazing and sent me the entire new when
Stefani collection lipsticks the lip
liners eyebrow stuff and then this
palette I'm just gonna show you guys and
swatch some of them this packaging is so
pretty I didn't receive the first round
of PR samples for her collection so this
is the first that I'm trying of her
whole Urban Decay
operation this is so freaking beautiful
I really like how they did the circles
kind of rising up like an album so this
is the blush and highlight palette you
probably can't even see the actual
shimmer that's in here but some of these
highlight shades or blush shades
whatever they're supposed to be are
beautiful I'm wearing the shade cherry
right now which is this like pinky one
swatch on these who this looks really
pretty look at this fourth one right
here this peachy one looks super pretty
I'm not going to take out all the
lipsticks and swatch them because I did
that exact thing on Instagram if you're
not following me on instagram it's the
teyla and you can go find the photo
where you swatch all of the lipsticks
okay and then there's this brow box
which is so cute if that means a shaved
blonde though that's not really gonna
work but I'm just gonna give this to a
friend bathwater blonde but look at this
packaging I feel like this is like a
little Polly Pocket thing whoa who
remembers the days of Polly Pocket so it
comes with two powder shades and a gel
shade down here and my leg just fell
asleep done there's all the
corresponding lip liners as well makeup
for ever sent me a really unexpected
super nice package and it had this
palette in here which is the palette
nine artist shadow palette I'm actually
wearing the purple shade right now that
I'm wearing is from their holiday
palette I was gonna use this but I just
wanted like a brighter purple this teal
shades it's like skin to me oh yeah they
have a very interesting consistency like
they're almost gel so there's some
swatches make up forevers also sent the
HD powder which I actually have never
tried I'm excited to try this out I
don't bake or anything because Mike it
makes my concealer look so bizarre under
my eyes it like takes away all the
Pepperidge it's really weird does that
happen anyone else but I'm excited to
use this for the rest of my face and see
how it works so we're gonna stop that
there because probably a super long
video but if you guys like this video
and you want more hauls give it a thumbs
up so I know make sure you check out the
description box for everything I
mentioned in Ebates and all the links to
products all the good stuff
love you guys thanks for watching and
see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
