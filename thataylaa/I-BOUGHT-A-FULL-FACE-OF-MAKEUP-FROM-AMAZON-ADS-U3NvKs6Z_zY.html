all right so today I'm doing a full face
of makeup with products that Amazon
recommended that I buy these are like
the products at the very top when you
search for something on Amazon that pops
up as a sponsored product this video is
not sponsored by Amazon these are just
sponsored products by the brands that
pay for these ads so basically just went
on Amazon search different words and
whatever popped up as the sponsored
product I purchased the majority of the
products that Amazon recommended were
really affordable I don't know if they
just think I'm completely broke based on
the amount of money I spend on their
site they didn't recommend anything
high-end so this is a pretty affordable
look I thought this would be fun to see
one what Amazon recommends that I do buy
and to just try products that I might
not necessarily have tried yet or been
inspired myself to pick up so I haven't
seen anyone do this exact video yet but
I was inspired by Sofia Nygaard she
hasn't done a makeup one I don't think
or an Amazon one but she does similar
videos where she buys products from
Facebook Ads snapchat ads Instagram ads
things like that buys whatever they tell
her to so I was watching some of those
videos and thought how fun would that be
to do that with makeup and what better
site to do that with then Amazon love of
my life where I spend 99.9 percent of my
money so if you guys are excited for
this video don't forget to give it a
thumbs up I hope you enjoy while you're
watching if you're new here you can join
the BAE Rito family and subscribe upload
every Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m.
Pacific time here we go
Amazon sponsored products alright its
first thing in the morning Super Bowl
Sunday when I'm filming this so the
primer that was recommended to me by
Amazon was the Maybelline master prime
blur and redness control primer great
clipping job so I was excited about this
one because I don't think I've ever
actually tried this primer I do have a
lot of redness on my face especially
from the accutane the lights kind of
like make my skin look a little bit less
red than it does in real life but it
definitely is pretty red especially if
I'm like outside in the cold it gets red
super quickly we'll see if this actually
controls some of the redness it doesn't
smell the best it feels very lightweight
not the most moisturizing my skin is on
the normal to dry side right now yeah it
actually feels a little bit like drying
as far as redness control I don't feel
like it did a whole lot so I probably
use this as like a color corrector
product it's a very light green color
and when you blend it in
it basically just disappears and turns
clear so since my skin feels a bit dry
right now I'm gonna take the setting
spray that was sponsored on Amazon and I
actually already had this one so that
was exciting this is the Bella Jade
makeup setting spray I've done a couple
of their Amazon videos makeup videos and
I tested this in one of them having used
it a whole lot since I just haven't been
like reaching for it but let's try it
again
has a really nice mister on it it's
organic and it looks like it has pretty
basic ingredients in here which I like
so I'm going to use on top of my makeup
to have a whole video test me out Amazon
brushes and actually some of those
brushes that I discovered in that video
I still use to this day every single day
skin is feeling a little bit more alive
right now it's not like a super dewy
setting spray but it definitely gave me
a little bit of glow which is nice so
the sponsored product for foundation was
the dermablend flawless creator drops I
actually already had these I have a
whole video reviewing these if you want
to know my full thoughts on them they
are too light which is good for mixing
and with other foundations to lighten
them at the shade n0 and they're also
super matte so I want to try mixing this
in with the Bourjois healthy mix serum
foundation because this one is too dark
and it's very dewy and I haven't reached
for this a whole lot ever since doing
the mixing all my foundations video as I
was going through all of those I
discovered so many foundations that I
totally forgot I had so I'm excited to
whip all those out again and try them
these are a hella liquidy I think I need
to remix that it almost looks like oil
just came out I mean I am full-on
shaking this thing that looks like it
lightened it pretty well see how this
shade is these drops really mattify yeah
my favorite kind of mix in pigment
foundation is the cover FX custom cover
drops if you like a glow and you like
coverage those are amazeballs
often that one layer I'm getting medium
coverage still have some one here so I'm
just gonna build it up a little bit
doesn't really want to build it's kind
of like wiping away not loving that
combo but it also doesn't look
horrendous so as I was searching for
these products I found a different
product pops up for every kind of search
term so if you search concealer versus
under eye concealer brings up obviously
different results in different sponsored
products because advertisers bid on
certain words so I ended up getting this
maybelline brightening creamy concealer
and fair I've never tried this I'm kind
of a
sited I'm really curious how this shade
is gonna be okay this looks pretty dark
if it's way too dark I'm just gonna
brighten this up with some powder okay
let's try this with my finger first
feels very thin and does feel pretty
creamy bring this on the top of my lid
too
it's pretty sheer very sheer it's like
not really covering anything it's
actually darkening my under eyes it's
even looking way better on camera right
now I mean it's like whoa let's try to
blend it out with a brush on the other
side this is my morphe g 38 best
concealer brush of life with a brush it
looks a bit more textured but I feel
like the coverage is a tiny bit better I
look like I haven't slept in 10 years
okay do I try and salvage this with
another concealer just realized I have
one powder for all over the face not
really an under eye setting powder so I
can't even really brighten this up so I
think what I'm gonna do is apply a
little bit of another concealer just to
fix my under eyes right now and then I'm
gonna use the powder in here to set the
under eyes yeah it's still like clinging
weird on top of it
okay so this powder was I think one of
the only products that wasn't like a
brand that you can find in the drugstore
or somewhere else was like a true Amazon
product drive never seen anywhere else
but this is the face powder we're gonna
be trying as the virgin ink translucent
botanical face powder cool packaging
look at that that's nice okay
definitely plastic but it looks nice so
the powder powder isn't super cheap it
was 1897 marked down from 39 50 okay
they just have like every keyword
possible in the title loose matte
setting foundation makeup natural great
and I smell for women oily dry skin who
knows what this actually is
oh okay there is no sealant on this it
actually looks like there is a sealant
on there right there so I think the
powder just seeped through some of the
holes cuz they are open so I think we're
good to go
I Will Survive that's like my motto of
YouTube lately it looks like it
definitely has a tint to it and it looks
like kind of a darker beige color not
sure how that's gonna be for the under
eyes but first I'm gonna use that as an
all-over face setting powder here we go
oh that has a weird smell to it dude
what does that smell it that smells like
that
powder I have for my coffee what is that
called okay this 100% has a color to it
and it's definitely darkening my face
and also taken away some of the coverage
maca powder is that what is called it
has like a nutty smell to it weird weird
scent man I mean my face looks pretty
makeup you right now you can like see
the powder sitting on top and it is kind
of emphasizing my texture I wouldn't say
this is a smoothing blurring powder or
anything I like to keep right here
without powder because it just makes dry
skin look a lot healthier or not as dry
and dead my monitor is actually looking
like it matches but it is quite dark
like at least two shades dark so I
definitely can't use this for under my
eyes my eyes already majorly creasing we
need to brighten these things up so I'm
gonna quickly use my Physicians Formula
powders for 19 bucks great plastic wood
packaging but that's about the only
thing I like about this let's do some
brows so for brows I got a Revlon
product that I actually have never tried
I don't think this is the Colorstay brow
pencil in 220 dark brown drugstore brow
products are always kind of a blur to me
they release so many all the time they
just start to melt together like I very
well may have argued tried this oh this
is interesting
look at this tip I don't think I've ever
seen a tip like this for a brow product
I'm gonna use the very tip right there
because this is an interesting design
like this is an oval I guess I could use
that for the very center you got to use
a really light hand with this because a
lot of product is quickly coming off I'm
gonna turn this to use the tip oh there
we go
hmm that one went flying this is exactly
what I always talked about that I don't
like in brow products when it's just too
pigmented and too smooth there's no grip
to it so you can just get over obviously
drawn on brow super quickly because of
that why is it looking hella red in the
front like it's literally looking purple
or red I feel like it's getting worse as
I'm spooling it out we're gonna leave it
at that let's move on to this brow
between the tip on this which just
doesn't make sense for an eyebrow shape
and then the color and the formula hard
passed hard best for bronzer I was kind
of shocked that they're paying too
this product because this is a hello old
covergirl bronzer to me this is like
old-school covergirl don't really know
why they're running ads on this product
but I bought it this is in copper
radiance 102 I think they only had one
shade on there or something
I'm gonna use my wet and wild brush and
I'm just dipping in not blending out the
easiest and it's looking quite patchy
could just be on top of that powder
holy see that looks like I
literally just put a highlighter where I
contour I mean that is not radiant that
is a highlighter lights are going down
low for this one oh yeah I don't think
my bronzer has ever looked worse if you
had a deeper skin tone of course you
could use this as a highlight shade but
I would not recommend using this as
bronzer whatsoever
no matter what your skin tone is just
because of the finish of it I mean it's
literally a highlighter it doesn't seem
to be blending in the easiest anywhere
I'm just blending this out with my
powder brush it's kind of like stuck
wherever you plop it down this one on
the other hand though is actually one of
my favorite blushes I was super happy
this was this Bond type product because
I already have this in my collection
this is the medium rose by covergirl
trublend blush this is bomb this is a
great blush I actually haven't used this
in a while but I want to say about a
year ago this was like my go-to blush
you guys have probably seen it in tons
of videos if you've been watching for
that long the shade is just gorgeous it
gives you that like flushed pink kind of
look this one blends out easily and has
a nice radiance to it where it's not a
highlighter it's just radiant my under
eyes are like crepe City over here you
could like hide something in there the
sponsored highlighter is actually one
that I know I despise wow we got a lot
of like got a lot of dead so far this is
the Maybelline master chrome metallic
highlighter a lot of people love this I
find it looks like eyeshadow on your
cheek it totally emphasizes texture in
my opinion but hey let's try it again
maybe it'll look different oh man yeah
do you see face is looking rough today
it emphasizes every single pore and
ounce of texture I'm actually going to
try it with this Kat Von D brush to see
if this kind of like diffuses it I've
been using this if I want just a sweep
of highlight and I want it
to be a little bit less concentrated
this is the what brush is this 25
hopefully this kind of smoothes it out a
little bit maybe I mean it's definitely
more diffused but I can't really see
anything so I'm gonna add a bit more way
they I know a lot of people love this
one for me it just does not work on my
skin there's a lot of blending happening
today alright let's go in with some Bela
Jade save the day Bela hopefully this
will kind of sink everything in make my
skin look less textured a little bit
different this time I think I'm actually
smelling that face powder oh wow for
some reason it is like magnifying the
scent of that face powder I gotta go get
that for you guys here's my maca powder
maca maca Watsa I swear it smells
exactly the same and it even has the
same color to it I am confused I think I
just might have put maca powder on my
face actually that setting spray just
massively helped my skin out it
definitely added a tiny bit of do and it
kind of just melted everything together
a little bit because when I'm super
excited to try it because I've never
heard of this brand it's the Elizabeth
Mott thank me later
I primer super cute packaging it has
this like gray and white situation a
little squeeze tube and it has this very
soft matte kind of bottle it looks like
it has a little bit of like a light pink
color to it so it doesn't really have a
pate color to it this is definitely one
that's gonna kind of rub off the
concealer or whatever you put on top of
your lid but it has a nice consistency
to it it feels a little bit thick which
is what I usually actually like in an
eye primer we'll see how everything
blends on top but it feels like it has a
really nice consistency to it now it's
kind of blended in it feels like it's
setting and it did give a little bit of
brightness to the lid when I searched
where eyeshadow palette the Maybelline
nudes eyeshadow palette came up and I
know I have this somewhere I could not
find it
I literally search through all of my
drawers I know it is somewhere so
instead we're gonna cheat a little bit
and use the 24 nudes just another
Maybelline palette and I don't actually
remember what I think of this have I
ever used this one kind of want to do a
gold eye there's not really transition
shade in here and there's not a whole
lot of matte colors to like working to
your crease normally I would use my
bronzer to do that this does have the
shimmer in it so it's not
be like a matte crease color but this is
what we're working with so I'm going to
blend this into the crease I mean even
on the eyes it looks like a shimmer
shadow on top of this eye primer though
it does have a nice stick to it it
almost feels like I'm using my Mac Paint
Pot I think to warm up my crease a
little bit I'm actually gonna take the
blush and just put a dab of this in the
crease and I'm gonna take this gold
shade on my finger and apply that to the
lid it almost looks like a cross between
a copper and a gold I'm gonna take this
deep deep brown shade because it looks
like the only matte dark ish shades in
here are this one and then the dark blue
I'm gonna work this Brown into the outer
V I'm liking this primer I feel like the
primer is actually doing something to
these eyeshadows right now where the
inner corner would take a little bit of
this white shade and actually kind of
mix it with this taupe B shade right
here I think I'm gonna take a little bit
of the master chrome face highlight and
put that right on the center oh yeah
there we go
very pretty as an eyeshadow I think I'm
gonna come back to the lower lash line
and let's do eyeliner this is the Revlon
color skinny liquid liner I don't think
I've ever tried this
I'm just looks like a basic brush tip
applicator there are some interesting
sound sounds coming from upstairs right
now I hope you guys are hearing this oh
Jesus Christ
hold him I might go these are the same
people who do gymnastics every night I
don't think that's aerobic exercise is
happening anymore eyeliner this is a
very flimsy brush applicator so this is
takin a lot of concentration so I'm
doing a wing I think I'm actually gonna
take a flat edge brush as this is still
wet and kind of do a little smudge
action here with the applicator it gives
you kind of those jagged edges so I'm
just kind of smoothing this out to this
for what I like an eyeliner I probably
wouldn't use this again because it's
just totally flimsy so it's a little bit
hard to control it take the dark brown
on the flat edge brush and just run this
on like the outer third now I would go
in with the same or do just go
Maybelline master chrome is on the
it's pac-man oh here it is I'm gonna run
that just kind of on the center slash
bring this all the way in I guess I'm
gonna wet that with the setting spray
just to get a little extra pop the
mascara that popped up was the covergirl
total tease you guys know how I feel
about this mascara I have the brown one
so that's what we're gonna be using this
wand is just why the little ball thing
on the end is just a little red X so I'm
turning it the other way just I can get
it without the ball having used brown
mascara in a while kind of liking the
brown shade this is inspiring me to whip
out a different Brown mascara is I do
feel like it's kind of making my eyes
pop a little I don't think I'm gonna put
on false lashes today I kind of just
want to keep it at this the same mascara
for my bottom lashes let's try and use
the ball oh no not no Bo
I just wanted to chop off this bowl all
right I do like the brown color like I
said I want to reach for another Brown
mascara it's kind of exciting
so for lipstick I was kind of bummed I
just got a boring Revlon lipstick I was
hoping I was gonna get like an obscure
Amazon brand the shade that came up was
225 rose wine so that is what I went
with
you don't smell anything didn't get a
lip liner so I'm just gonna try and do
this with that one whenever I do this if
I'm not using a lip liner I'll just turn
the lipstick to use the tip to kind of
draw in that line
as you would with the lip liner that
shade is super pretty it's bright but
it's still wearable rose shade I feel
like it's looking a little bit more
orange or bright on camera so if you
like would be a perfect 10 of spring red
where it has a little bit of that warmth
to it well I don't know should I put
them on look how crazy of a difference
false eyelashes make so this is the
final look using all products that
Amazon recommended that I buy sponsor
and add products I feel like the vast
majority were duds this time around
things that I would use again the
setting spray primer I think I'm most
pleasantly surprised by and just the way
they blend it out there's something
about it that I really enjoyed so I
wouldn't use the thank me later
primer again I'm gonna keep trying this
out I think those were kind of the only
things out of this one that I found okay
or good we had a lot of rejects this
time around but I hope you guys enjoyed
