Friday this is where I try out a new
foundation every single Friday on my
channel I have a whole playlist linked
down below I've done tons I don't even
know how many foundation Fridays fitted
at this point today for foundation
Friday we're doing something a little
bit different I was on Sephora doing my
nightly scroll like usual and I think it
was on the home page where the
foundation finder thing popped up and
instantly I was like that would be a
cool video to take the quiz see what
foundation Sephora recommends to me
actually purchase one of the foundations
and then review it for you guys and see
how accurate their quiz was and see if I
like it or not
Wow I just had all that in one take that
was pretty good I've never taken their
foundation finder quiz I don't know if
it's a new thing that's on there or it's
been around for a while so we're gonna
go through the foundation finder I took
this screen grab as I was doing it for
the first time the first question that
they ask you is what kind of coverage
are you looking for you guys can guess
what I chose give me that full coverage
bro what kind of finish would you like
I chose radiant finish I have dry skin
right now so I definitely prefer more
radiant finish next they asked which
formula do you prefer I put no
preference because I wanted to see what
they recommended for me and I and I
don't really care I'm down to try
anything and then the next question was
how would you describe your shade
porcelain to like that was a quick one
there what's your skin type I put dry do
you prefer to have sun protection I put
no preference because again I didn't
want to limit what they might have given
me so I just put no preference so then
they gave me my results and they gave me
five foundations to choose from and I
actually have tried every single one of
these foundations except for the Giorgio
Armani my astro fusion makeup so that is
the one that I decided to go with for
this video
keeping in mind that I selected dry skin
radiant and full coverage I think these
selections will see what I think of the
Giorgio Armani but far as the other four
I think these selections are pretty good
I definitely would say the NARS natural
radiant foundation I would put under
that category same with it cosmetics
that's pretty much full coverage you can
build it up to full coverage for sure
NARS all day luminous again I'm gonna
have to give another shot I don't
remember that
being full coverage though and then the
tomforde forgetting $85 waterproof
foundation and concealer I have a whole
other video on that one too I do think
they gave me pretty good results based
on what I entered into the quiz I do
notice that they put two very pricey
products on there one of which I was
forced to buy Thank You spora you know
keep in mind that I'm assuming their
goal is to have you buy some of the
Foundation's from these results so so
putting an $85 Tom Ford Foundation in
there they might be trying to get you to
empty out your wallet here so I fell for
it I purchased a $64 foundation this is
the Georgie Armani my Astro fusion
makeup it has SPF 15 in it this retails
for $64 and you get one fluid ounce of
product in here
most Giorgio Armani foundations retail
for $64 actually just reviewed another
one the luminous silk foundation in 15
days of foundation so on so forth
website this only comes in 11 shades but
on Giorgio Armani's website it comes in
16 shades so if your shade is not listed
on Sephora you might have to check it
out on Giorgio Armani the lightest shade
two said fair with warm undertones the
next up shade three said fair with
neutral undertones so I went with the
shade three because I do have more
neutral undertones and warm undertone
and I personally find that if the
undertone is closer to my skin tone it
can make the foundation look a lot
better and closer to shade match even if
the actual shade is a little bit dark so
I typically read the descriptions and
will go for something that says more
neutral undertone so on safaris website
I actually think they have the wrong
description listed for this product they
have one that's where the primer it says
a lightweight makeup primer ball blob so
I'm pretty sure they have the wrong
description listed there so I checked
out Giorgio Armani's website and it's a
totally different description about a
foundation so it says brighten your
complexion with refining liquid
foundation that leaves behind naturally
glowing skin basically this is a matte
foundation it has water free oils that
have a 60% time-release fresh feel non
greasy finish 11 percent pigments for a
perfect complexion there's no powder no
mask effect contains the Lotus oil known
for anti free radical properties anti
free I don't know what is going on with
this description so based off of that
description it doesn't say anything
about being full coverage also says it's
supposed to be a matte finish and in
Sephora squiz I did select radiant
finish so we'll see how the finish is
but
you guys are excited for this video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up I
forgot to do swatches let's insert some
swatches right here so you can see how
the shade three compares to some of my
other foundations
alright so swatch time right here's the
Giorgio Armani maestro foundation in the
shade 3 next over is the Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation in the shade
3.75 NARS Ultra radiant foundation in
Mont Blanc NARS sheer glow in Siberia
derma called 2:08 CYO life proof and 101
and Marc Jacobs remarkable in the
lightest shade 10 it's 7:28 in the
morning right now we're getting an early
start I have my Sigma f80 here I'm gonna
used on 1/2 my face and they actually
brought back my friggin favorite morphe
sponge one you guys let me know on
Twitter that this is now back they
discontinued it totally took it off
their site and now it's back on I'm
gonna purchase a new one to make sure
that it's the same exact sponge as the
one I love and recommend because I don't
like any of the other morphe sponges I
only like this one it's called this
stiletto sponge
I love the round bottom right here super
squishy this is my favorite sponge I
stopped using it in videos because it
wasn't available so I'm stoked that they
brought it back I'm gonna give this a
shake it says to shake it really well on
their website so you have a glass bottle
and then this has a little dropper guide
I'm just gonna start out with about that
amount and see how far it goes let's
start out with a brush on this side this
is gonna be fun with these earrings well
feels super lightweight oh wow we're
getting some clingen right there we're
gonna attempt to fix that in a second
because I'm getting a major clinging
right here around dryness but the shade
I think looks pretty good looking at my
neck this reminds me a lot the way it
goes on of the Maybelline Dream liquid
or the actually have right here or the
hourglass immaculate liquid to powder it
feels super super thin this definitely
is more dewy than the two of those man
it feels like you're putting air on your
face like you don't feel like you're
blending anything on I broke out a
little bit from I think a face mask I
used last night totally doing something
weird on my forehead let's see how this
does with a sponge it's almost like
removing it
self a little bit when you blend it Oh
missed you so the foundation is heavily
scented has that perfumed kind of scent
which I would like to avoid in a
foundation which it's not necessary and
that fragrance can irritate your skin
more so with this Bunge it actually
looks a tiny bit more matte I feel like
the brush was giving me kind of like
separation almost I'm just trying to go
over everything which is definitely
helping it seems to be actually like
mattifying now it doesn't look nearly as
dewy is when I first put it on so it's
looking not great up here even after
smoothing it out with a sponge it looks
like it's separating cling and weird
right on my forehead and then also
certain areas down here don't love how
it looks on my nose I would say it's
about light coverage high light coverage
it basically just tone down my redness
this side with the sponge it looks like
light coverage for sure my redness and
stuff is still coming through right here
kind of build it up right here a little
bit it's just doing weird things to
certain parts of my face where there's
any kind of slight dryness it's just
totally clinging and kind of emphasizing
it after a few minutes it looks more
like a satin matte finish okay
this just looks pretty crappy I don't
have a whole lot of dryness on my face
right now this is taking every tiny
little ounce of it and making my skin
look pretty crappy I'm gonna zoom in it
is looking rough up here by my eyebrows
between my eyebrows right here just all
over also down here it looks okay in
this area on both sides and that's about
it as soon as you get closer to my nose
on my nose it is just like so at 7:44
I'm gonna do the rest of my makeup and
I'll be right back
it's now 841 we're gonna call the
check-in time 8 o'clock since that's
when I finished up with my face makeup
so I did end up setting this one because
there was no way that I would wear this
foundation again without giver hear
yourself talk and you like don't
recognize your own voice that's what's
happening right now it wasn't super
tacky like I do feel like you could
probably get away with blending powder
on top of it without setting with the
powder just obviously depending on your
skin type but I did set it with the
laura geller balance in Brighton powder
because it was needing some help I would
not wear this foundation again on its
own at all it looks pretty crappy on my
skin so the laura geller definitely
helped especially on my forehead i still
don't think it looks good enough to
where i would wear these two again i
don't even think i would mix this in
with stuff because there's just nothing
about it that is making my skin look
good basically still not looking good on
my dry patches and right here on my
forehead a shade 3 i think works so as
far as how the sephora foundation finder
worked with this pick i actually don't
think this is similar at all to the
other foundations that were listed there
this one is much more matte much more
light coverage I would not have paired
this with those other foundations that
they had listed when I would definitely
would not put it in the dry skin
category definitely would not pay $64 I
wouldn't pay $24 for this I wouldn't pay
$4 for this but we'll see how it wears
throughout the day so I'm gonna show you
what this looks like in natural light
and then we will do a flash test I
actually think it looks a bit better out
here like looking at it in natural
lighting doesn't look as bad it still
definitely does not look good on my
forehead and it I wouldn't say it looks
good but I'm gonna zoom in real close
think you guys can see that there's just
major Kling in and texture all up over
my forehead and this is after the powder
made it look a bit better
keep in mind you looked way worse and
then here is the rest of my face
so here's where it's clinging and kind
of getting patchy super Creasy right
there I don't love how it's sitting on
my nose either we're gonna go do a flash
test so keep in mind this one does have
SPF 15 in it and I don't have any kind
of SPF on underneath the foundation but
I do have that laura geller powder on
top oh oh man
flash is so weird like how does my body
look hella day it looks like I have
self-tanner on or something and then my
face is like a ghost when I would not
wear in flash photography my face looks
like it's like 10 shades lighter than my
neck the makeup on the rest of my face
I've been trying out these two bronzers
I think I got both of these off of hot
look I'll have the link for hot look
down below but it's like a flash sale
site they mark down a ton of makeup this
is the Elgin s color correcting bronzing
powder it looks totally different on the
face and it looks in the pan for some
reason on my skin it pulls very warm
like it's not even looking like it on my
finger but as soon as I put it on my
face and start blending it out it looks
a little bit to oranjee I like this
laura geller bronzer and the shades
sunrise fair a lot better I've used this
a few times so far and this one just
kind of warms up your face without
looking too orangie so for blush and my
eyeshadow i use the new pixie and Chloe
Morello palette and I really like Chloe
she seems like a cool girl she seems
funny the blushes are very pigmented you
just need like a DAB and you'll get
enough pigmentation on your cheeks but I
just kind of used a mix of these two
blushes I really liked the matte shades
the shimmer shades I couldn't really get
them to pop the matte shades were
beautiful everything blended out really
easily I'm really happy to see someone
do a more cool toned palette because I
love cool toned shades I do like how the
finished look turned out for my inner
corner use the Urban Decay heavy metal
glitter liner in the shade glam rock I
just popped this glitter right on the
inner corner my lashes are kiss gala
cannot get enough of these lashes I'm
into them liner I've been trying out the
Sigma liquid liner pen this is super
matte super black but I can't get like
the smooth edge on all of the areas so
then I went over it in sur compartments
with my Physicians Formula my eyes have
been getting super super watery lately
throughout the day to wear my eye makeup
just like completely comes off right
here so we'll see how this one holds up
throughout the day too I haven't worn
this for like a full full day yet
where's my highlight I used the jcat you
roll in Bella Rose this is one of my
all-time favorite face highlighters so
pretty if you want like a pop in light
pink shade I've been in love with this
la girl liner this is a non-stop nude
this is one of those liners that just
works with so many different lip colors
news and on top I use the new Too Faced
what shade is this birthday sue these
are so nice and moisturizing and creamy
feeling if you have really dry lips like
I do right now it just kind of oh and it
just had someone my teeth how long has
that been there they don't feel like
ones that aren't gonna slide around like
I feel like I'm gonna have to touch this
up throughout the day probably and it is
transferring to my teeth a little bit
again the check-in time is 8 o'clock
I'll see you guys in a few hours and
natural lighting for the next check-in
so it's not 2:30 I've had this on for
six and a half hours now
I still haven't eaten lunch starving got
in the filming zone I feel like it
actually doesn't look nearly as bad as
it did when I first put on like with
this powder I don't think it's too bad
looking again not too where I would want
to wear this again because it does look
a little bit just like heavy makeup you
to me let me turn down the brightness
here's my forehead it just looks pretty
makeup B and textured I do feel like I'm
getting a lot of creasing get increasing
on my upper lip which I haven't been
getting lately around my nose it doesn't
look the best don't like how it looks
around my mouth area major crease in
here's what we're working with six and a
half hours in I'm craving Chipotle so
bad I'm gonna resist though I'm on a
healthy eating and working out kick
right now burrito bowl sounds so damn
good though I'll see you guys at the end
of the night so it's 6:00 what time is
it 647 system for almost 12 hours I feel
like it has looked exactly the same
throughout the day hasn't gotten any
worse or anything just wouldn't probably
reach for this especially for the price
tag I just definitely don't love it
quite as much as I should for that much
I feel like it's rubbed off a little bit
right here this is kind of where I rest
my hand when I work on this side - down
here
I definitely don't think this one is for
dry skin so as far as the sephora
recommendation thing i would not have
put this under the dry skin category I
think because it's like a serum and
super liquidy it seems like it would be
decent for dry skin but this was such a
bad one so much separation and come on
to any of my dry areas that I have on my
face I just really could not get this
one to look semi decent without having a
powder kind of even everything out so
for me this one's definitely passed like
I said I wouldn't purchase this one for
four dollars obviously if you have a
different skin type than I do this one
might look totally different but it just
sat horribly on top of my skin here's
the thing with light coverage
foundations for me I'm totally fine with
wearing a light coverage foundation if
it doesn't look like I am wearing makeup
there are definitely foundations I have
that are so smoothing and just look like
skin like the jus a skin tint perfect
example light coverage looks like skin
it doesn't look like you have any makeup
on your face and then there are projects
like this where it's light coverage but
it looks like I have makeup sitting on
top of my skin there's like weird things
happening and for me it's just not even
worth putting anything on if that's the
result I'm gonna get with a light
coverage foundation and especially one
for $64 so if I am using a light
coverage foundation I want it to
obviously look good so that's where I'm
at with this foundation but I hope you
guys enjoyed this video idea if you did
don't forget to give it a thumbs up and
Ulta actually has a similar foundation
quiz so let me know if you want me to do
altas I love you guys thanks for
