which means its foundation Friday every
single Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time on my
channel I do a foundation video but in
today's video I wanted to do a video
trying out ulties foundation quiz I did
one on Sephora a couple months ago I
tried out Sephora's foundation finder so
link that video and I and down below I
thought it'd be fun to do the same thing
with ulties foundation quiz and see how
accurate is Ulta also carries different
kinds of foundations and obviously they
have drugstore foundations as well so to
koltes Foundation quiz and bought
whatever the heck they told me so if
you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the burrito family
and subscribe I upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. save time
alright so when you start out it says
you're going to tell them about the
coverage finish and the one benefit
you're looking for will do the
matchmaking and find your best
foundation yet so the first section
coverage I selected full coverage it
says conceals most problem areas acne
scars and birthmarks for a flawless look
then it goes on to the finished question
says what foundation finish makes you
look flawless I obviously chose dewy I'm
a little dewy obsessed then we move on
to the Benefit section and this is the
one foundation benefit that you care
most about I wanted to select like four
on here I probably would have selected
long wear evens tone hydrates okay so I
guess three so since my skin is dry I
was gonna go with hydrates but then I
read the description for the evens tone
one and it said a flawless base and
smooth texture and texture is one of my
big issues with foundation I really like
a foundation that is smoothing that so I
ended up going with evens tone and I
figured since I chose the dewy finish
hopefully I would still get a foundation
that was a little bit more hydrating
because of that your matches are
revealed and I got ten results here so
I've actually tried quite a few of these
but there were a few that I haven't
tried I love that cosmetics CC
illumination a cargo bag foundation I
actually just reviewed during 15 dates
of foundation NARS sheer glow I don't
actually know if I have a dedicated
video on NARS sheer glow if not I will
do that la girl foundation I do feel
like falls under all those categories
it's smoothing its dewy it's good for
dry skin it's hydrating I haven't tried
the lorac pore affection foundation so I
they also ordered that one out of the
ten recommendations they did give me
three drugstore priced options so we
have the note luminous moisturizing
foundation which I have not tried
L'Oreal Lumi have a video on that la
girl have a video on that too they end
up going with the Lancome renergie lift
anti-wrinkle lifting SPF 20 foundation
so spend a sheen retails for forty seven
dollars you get one fluid ounce of
product so it's definitely not a cheap
foundation so I ended up going with the
shade 140 what you guys will see how it
works out but there is a shade 110
underneath that I think the reason why I
went with 140 is because 110 in the past
has been super pink and also too light
for me so I figured 140 would probably
be closer but I am gonna do swatches in
a second but let's read a little bit
about this thing there are a lot of
words on this page about this foundation
basically if I were to sum this up it's
supposed to be kind of an anti-aging
anti-wrinkle younger than ever make your
complexion look even and line free it
says it's for normal to dry skin types
which I am moderate to full coverage
instantly lifts the appearance of lines
fights against wrinkles supposed to be
kind of more dewy gives you an optical
radiance effect has vitamin E in it
fragrance free and non comedogenic so
everything it says on here is typically
exactly what I gravitate towards I want
something that's a little bit dewier
plumping as far as the description
sounds good to me I'm gonna serve
swatches right here so you can see how
the shade 140 compares to some of my
other foundations I am moving right now
I'm pre filming all these videos so my
makeup is completely packed right now I
have a few foundations I left on my desk
mostly just for swatching and like
everyday use so unfortunately I can't
compare these to my Lancome foundations
right now but I'm gonna pop in some
swatches right here so you can get kind
of an idea of how 140 looks against some
of my other foundations okay so here are
some foundation swatches right here is
the Lancome foundation in they'll not
lightest shade the shade 140 next to it
right here is NARS natural radiant
foundation in Mont Blanc Tarte
rainforest of the sea foundation in
porcelain derma called 2:08 and CYO life
proof and 101 both of these are pretty
close shade matches for me right here's
the cover FX custom cover drops in the
shade and
I'm gonna do my usual 10-hour wear test
with this one flash test everything so
here we go
Foundation Friday okay so it's almost
nine o'clock in the morning right now I
am excited for this one because I feel
like everything as far as it claims is
like exactly what I want in a foundation
so we'll see how it is have no idea how
that shade is gonna be on me I thought
it would be closer than the 110 shade
but we'll see I haven't done swatches
yet this is like a very tiny pump what
the heck it's like smaller than my
finger do have my face in my Sigma f80
flat top and my other half with this
bunch I also wanted to let you guys know
that as of right now and I'm editing
this and this is going up the Sigma set
that I did is live again so we have more
in stock so hopefully there's one for
everyone now and I'm going to leave that
down below link in the description box
if you wanted to get your hands on one
of the limited edition sets if you have
no idea what I'm talking about I did a
whole announcement video that also
linked down below let's do the brush
side first I've already washed
moisturize prepped my skin oh I think
this shade is gonna be perfect if it
doesn't oxidize it says it's fragrance
free oh I feel like it's already
oxidizing yeah it's already darkening a
bit it's about a shade too dark maybe
even two shades don't know if it's
showing up but it's definitely too dark
maybe I should have gone with 110 it's
looking pretty nice so far I love the
glow definitely light coverage I can
still see everything coming through it
basically just cover it up some of my
redness on my cheeks
it feels very lightweight and it has a
nice Glide - it doesn't feel like it's
dragging or anything this feels a little
bit like the Becca aqua luminous right
now so everything except the shade right
now
I'm liking it's looking pretty I'm gonna
pull this all the way down my neck in a
second let's try the sponge side I wish
I could just watch it next to the
Lancome foundations but those are all
packed for a more natural looking
foundation this is looking really pretty
so far love the radiance love how
lightweight it feels whoo that looks
pretty I got how glowy and nice and
smooth that looks up there might have
gotten a tiny bit better coverage on the
brush side overall yeah it looks about
the same sponge and brush with this one
you go either way you can still see
scarring and stuff coming through so I
would say this is definitely more light
coverage I would not call this full
coverage at least off that one layer I'm
gonna take my sponge though and just try
and build this up a little bit right on
my scarring see if we can get it a
little bit better coverage
not a whole lot so I think it's safe to
say this is probably high light coverage
when I say that some people get confused
I just mean out of light coverage it's
like the highest light coverage not
quite medium coverage but it's not super
light coverage okay I'm gonna do some
major neck action right now pull this
all the way down I have a ton to do
today I have a lot of moving things to
do
furniture deliveries editing so I'm
gonna be out and about so I'm gonna try
not to have a super dark face right now
all right so right now it's looking
pretty it looks really nice and just
kind of natural glowy it just kind of
makes my skin look a little bit better
without looking super makeup II I think
this is definitely more for people who
just want more of a natural looking
foundation I really like how it looks on
my forehead look at that glow oh it
actually feels weird it feels like it's
drying down to almost like a little bit
of a powder finish there is I can still
feel the tiny bit but it feels very like
thin and natural on the face doesn't
feel super sticky I do think I could
blend stuff on top of here which is
exciting that's interesting because it
looks really luminous but it actually
kind of sets down so right now it's 909
I'm gonna do the rest of makeup and I'll
be right back okay so it's now 9:40 I
cannot remember the last time I saw you
guys I think those 910 we're just gonna
call the check-in time 9:15
I didn't powder my face or anything like
usual so that's about when the check-in
should be everything blended out really
easily on top I didn't feel like there's
any kind of drag to it which I really
liked it does feel super lightweight and
it's it's really bizarre because it's
super glowy but again to the touch it
doesn't feel super makeup II so that's a
huge bonus right there I think it looks
beautiful if you like radiant more
natural looks and even now that I have
my concealer and
I didn't spot concealer anywhere but I
feel like now that just that I have the
rest of my makeup on it's looking like a
lot more coverage it doesn't look quite
as natural also probably because I have
a ton of makeup on right now but if
I did a more natural look I think this
could pass as like a natural looking
foundation but also doesn't look too
light coverage with this kind of like
dramatic look did I turn my mic on feel
like it's making my forehead look so
nice and plump it's not settling into
any my lines up here and it is supposed
to be good for wrinkles
his foundation sounds like it's geared
more towards a little bit mature skin or
maturing skin mature ring hi I had
someone the other day point out a gray
hair to me can you not right now I think
literally the only thing I'm not liking
is just the shade and again they do have
a lighter shade so I'm definitely gonna
pick that up if I end up really liking
this one by the end of the day so the
makeup on the rest of my face I have not
been able to put this frickin bronzer
down this is the MUA bronzed perfection
matte such a beautiful tone love this
bronzer I don't know why I ever stopped
using it my blush I use physicians for a
vintage Rouge butter blush and we have
some lashes gel on there I have those
lash things where you put the lashes
back into the case but how do you know
which lash is which then where highlight
a use Physicians Formula Butter
highlight mine is kind of broken but
this is in the shade a pink rose and
then I tried out the Tarte toasted
palette I actually got this one off a
glam bought it and so far so good wasn't
like totally blown away but I mean
everything was easy to work with blend
it out I've been really liking bringing
my eyeliner a little bit farther in and
almost creating like a cat eye thing I
feel like it just like elongate the eyes
a little bit so that's what I did
been doing that and then my lipstick is
elf metallic lip crayon this is in the
shade magnetic mauve this is such a
freaking pretty color that just all my
makeup I think okay whoa I just
discovered that my computer can kind of
be used as like a chin reflector so as
far as how the ultra foundation picker
worked I think everything except the
full coverage claim I wouldn't call this
full coverage I definitely wouldn't put
this in the full coverage category but I
do think falls under the radiance
category the dewy finish and then also
when I selected even skin tone and it
said that it was smoothing I would say
that this is a smoothing foundation it's
definitely not one that's emphasizing my
texture or anything which can be hard to
find so we're gonna do a flash test you
can see how it looks in flash
photography and then also
I'm sure you guys clip in natural
lighting so here we are in natural
lighting I think it looks so freakin
pretty and glowy look at that again this
is one if you like Chloe skin if not
you're not gonna like this one but my
forehead looks bum so let's go do a
flash test right now oh it looks pretty
and flash looks nice there's not a major
flash back even though there is SPF 20
in here keep in mind it is about a shade
or two too dark for me so that kind of
helps so if there is flash back it
wouldn't make it look as light as if it
matched me so maybe that's why but in
flash this way it looks nice on my skin
again it looks really smoothing so yeah
looks really pretty in flash see you
guys in a few hours and natural lighting
for the next second okay so I'm actually
in my new place right now so this is
gonna be the filming room and probably
sounds super echoey right now cuz
there's no furniture in here and it's
just wood floors right now it's 2:15 so
it's been on for five hours and I was
out running the errands and stuff and
was looking at it in the mirror like I
went to home goods saw it in the mirror
and it looked beautiful obviously the
only thing is to shade it actually is
looking like it matches but my face
definitely looks orange doesn't seem to
be like breaking down a whole lot yet
I don't have a mirror right here to
check it out but I did just look in the
bathroom err
so here's what it looks like love how
lightweight this feels like I don't feel
like I'm wearing a foundation right now
I am pretty sure I've seen this egged on
Wi-Fi I don't have the internet set up
here yet but as soon as I get on Wi-Fi
it went to order the shade 110 that's
how excited I am about this one today
I'm gonna be vlogging parts this move so
I think that might actually go up first
so check that out
I'll let you down below and in the I
don't see you guys if yours or the last
chicken just set down the smear and
water apparently but it's now 7:15
there's the time there it is it looks
and feels so light weight and just
radiant that it doesn't look super
makeup be like when I look at my
forehead it just looks like a nice like
veil over it almost I would say that
this is one that's definitely good on
texture I mean you can't even really see
it a whole lot sitting up there which
you know if you have textured skin is
hard to find I do look a little bit
drier / crazier around this area which
usually happens but overall I mean I've
been looking in the mirror and stuff and
every time I've looked at my face and
different lighting throughout the day
today I really love how this foundation
looks so I'm excited I feel like we
haven't had this big of a winner since
like the last 15 days foundation series
this one kind of reminds me of the Becca
Foundation but right now I'm liking this
one a little bit more just like the way
it sits on my skin I am gonna order the
shade 110 I might have to mix it too I
have a feeling that one will be too
light this one's too dark so I'm just
gonna keep this one and all mix those
two shades probably this might be too
much glow for some people but if you
like glow and if you have dry skin
especially I think this one could be a
winner yes I feel like there's like the
spectrum I like no just need to shave my
legs but I hope you guys enjoyed this
