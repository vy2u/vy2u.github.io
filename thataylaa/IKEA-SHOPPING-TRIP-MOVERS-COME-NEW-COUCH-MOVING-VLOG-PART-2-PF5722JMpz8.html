day
so freaking tired right now but the room
is done and I'm just waiting for the
moves right now woke up with a giant
stress is it this is the first day I've
had in like a month and a half
Titan Airy stress and I'm lovin this
highlight this is the cosmetics my
sculpt a face palette highlight all
right so the move is done I am so
frickin happy I feel so relieved I am so
impressed with these makers if you're in
the Seattle area I would highly
recommend awesome movers think the whole
thing is two guys one truck it's a flat
rate I'm not getting paid to say this I
wish it was but they were just amazing
they had my whole whoa they had my whole
other apartment unpacked within 25
minutes I had a pile of stuff that was
gonna take to Goodwill and they took it
down for me then we get here he asked me
if I had a boyfriend or someone to help
me like put together my bed
single life no he's like oh no problem
we'll put together for you so they
literally assembled my bed like I just
think that was so above and beyond and
so kind of them here's my bed this is
what the French are looking like I'm
probably gonna be moving stuff around I
have no idea where I'm going to be
putting my filming stuff and lights and
where the setup is gonna be I think I'm
gonna put on my bedding and start
putting together some stuff I might head
to Ikea because it's Monday so it's
probably a really good day to go to Ikea
everyone is at work
this looks so artsy it does Jordi is my
friend from high school
yeah that's weird six years literally
 that still feels like it's like
weird we are currently getting pancakes
now we're gonna head to Ikea it's so
funny the looks you get when you whip
out a guarantee like people get so
uncomfortable but we're gonna vlog in
IKEA and the movers just came yeah
pancakes excited
we are in the happiest place on earth
and joy is having a lot of fun ooh
that's cool
I think I want the white one white or
black but black might look good with the
desk excuse black oh here it is
do you want this one yeah take one for
the team I really don't know okay my
goal is for you know success I got this
all right they're out of the Alex and I
drawers which is freaking awesome
dedication
look at this marble table though this is
like crime and stuff better alright so
we went to Ikea got some cupcakes it was
a good time I don't know how I thought I
was gonna go to Ikea by myself
definitely need two people for that
everything is in the new apartment I'm
waking up at 4:00 a.m. to go to Atlanta
and I just wanna show you guys the bed
so this is how the bed's looking so far
I got my comforter on there I have like
a bunch of other pillows but they're
packed away might be attempting to stay
in this like a dark grey IKEA was
actually sold out of the Alex 9 drawer
so I got two of these this is like the
bigger version it's that that's what it
is and I actually got two of these so
I'm gonna take off the wheels on one of
them and just stack them on top of each
other and thinking of putting that along
that wall I think or that wall I don't
know I also got this thing looks great
huh it's the busy bee Jojo or something
whatever glass shelves with the black
rims and I got marbled white contact
paper they think I'm gonna put on a
couple of the glass shelve it that'll
probably go over here a ton of stuff at
IKEA oh and hey our couches are here
greyish like tweed material and it has
brown legs which I thought would go good
with like the mid-century modern kind of
thing we're gonna have going on so I
have a bright area rug coming a coffee
table from Wayfarer and I will probably
do like a gallery wall over here we
actually have a lot more space right
there than I thought I think we're gonna
put like a cool plant this is what the
couch looks like up close
I'll have the model if I can list it
down below it was from more furniture
and I got a super good deal on it and
I'm stoked what else do they get I got a
bunch of stuff from Ikea organization
stuff I got a couple of white pillows
for my bed so I'm going to call it a
wrap I hope you guys liked this vlog if
