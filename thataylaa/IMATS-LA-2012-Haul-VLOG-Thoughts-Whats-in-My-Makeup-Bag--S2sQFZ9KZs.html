and I am so exhausted right now I
literally got ready precisely for the
fact that I was filming I wanted to film
this intro for you guys I'm talking
about IMAX and everything free warning
this is gonna be really long I'm
going to have down below in the
description box there's going to be all
the times with when I talk about what so
if you want to see only the hall all the
times we'll be done there so you can go
right to that point if you don't want to
watch this whole like 20 minute long
video okay so for IMATS I stayed at my
friend's house in LA and we left that
morning we gotcha I'm us around like
12:30 I think you walk in and there is a
huge showroom it was like so crazy busy
or wearing like crazy on their
faces it was kind of overwhelming the
first person I met was actually when we
were walking on the way to our mats and
we were like me and Laura my friend were
at one side the street and then on the
other side of the street I see this girl
and I was like her eyebrows look like
really familiar and then we get closer
and it was Nicky or Eurasian Nicky I'll
put her username right here she was so
cool and down-to-earth and I felt like
we had known each other if I like we
were already friends like it did not
feel like I was talking until stranger
or whatever but we always talked on
Twitter and stuff so it was really cool
to like finally meet her in person but
she was leaving as we were going in
sorry if I'm like super not energetic
right now I'm like literally about to
pass out as I'm talking but then we were
like walking around we had been there
for like two hours Soph Fashion Show and
stuff that you guys will be in the vlog
then I was texting Shelby
xoxo Shelby ji and we met a holy
guys she is like even more gorgeous in
real life she I took off my heels I was
like this like my feet already hurt
and so she was wearing these like 5-inch
heels I looked like a midget next to her
it was really cool to me Shelby she was
super sweet and gorgeous and all of
these people's channels will be down
below but
oh yeah Laura and I were in there for
probably like three hours you like there
wasn't as many like of the big people
here that the then there was at the New
York IMATS they'd get to meet a few
people that was planning on meeting I
really freakin wanted to meet
meghanrosette
I was like I'm going on a Meghan hunt
right now
felt like I was trying to find
Waldo so make sure you check down below
for all the times if you want to
fast-forward to a certain point
I'm going to film this really really
quick because I'm supposed to already be
on the road right now
why did the lighting look normal what
tilt my head maybe I should just film
the whole video like this by
instagrammed a picture of my eye Matt's
makeup bag and you guys wanted a what's
in my makeup bag video alright so I have
to makeup bags I'm bringing the first
one is this super cute leopard neon
green one that I got from my zero dollar
swap with Court four five four five
still go watch that if you want to and
then this is the big-ass glittery thing
okay so I'm just gonna pull out whatever
where's my red my red tighten you get
out here I don't like it accents the
moment I start filming first thing I
pull out is Urban Decay's all-nighter
spray this is what I use before and
after my makeup and it lasts all day
with this stuff and I literally will not
go a day without wearing this I'm
addicted to setting spray the next thing
I pull out I don't know why I have this
we're gonna put that back in my room
because it's gonna Navy a setting spray
don't need both of those okay then I
have my foundation I'm bringing the
Revlon Colorstay whipped foundation in
two hundred sand beige and this is what
I did a review on love this stuff
wearing it right now this is what I set
it with is the Maybelline mineral power
powder foundation and this has an SPF of
eighteen that's a really random number
and the bronzer I use is what is this
 Milani baked bronzer and glow it's
one of those baked bronzer so it has
like a little bit of shimmer in it but
it's not super glittery concealer I have
been using which was actually in the
products I freaking hate video but I've
been using it not only as a concealer
but more as like a brow bone highlighter
and I like it for that and that's the
instant age rewind race circle
eyebrow pencil is maybelline define a
brow and medium brown and I'll say about
that it's a brow pencil it's good like
it my eye primer I use is Mac's
painterly paint-pot
if you don't use a primer you know what
you're doing with your life the blush
I'm bringing which is really dirty is
Mac's improvise and it's this like I
think this is probably another baked
mineral blush and it's so super pretty
like rose color with like
pink shimmer in it and then another
blush I'm bringing is L'Oreal True Match
and innocent flush and it's just a super
pretty peach color I wear this pretty
much every day it's matte which I like
it's another concealer and it's the derm
dermablend cover creme in rose beige and
I just got this I instagrammed a picture
of it the other day and it's super super
full coverage alright this is kind of
ridiculous I brought a lot of makeup and
I brought this quad just because this is
the shade I use for my brow bone
highlight on my eyes every single day as
you can see I hit pan and this is just a
Physicians Formula pellet in Canyon
classics this random eyeshadow I brought
is Mac's
modern pewter and this is from the extra
dimension collection and it's so
freaking pretty mascaras I have three
then bringing first one is L'Oreal
voluminous carbon black mascara and
that's what I have on my eyes right now
and then the second one is L'Oreal
doesn't have a name it's into black too
obviously you could see it runs the wet
and wild make a pump waterproof mascara
and this is what I put on my bottom
lashes what else am i bringing and I'm
bringing only two lip things I'm
bringing Mac's creme to noon the Revlon
Super Lustrous in peach petal oh this
actually has an SPF of 15 that's pretty
cool the last couple things is my
eyeliner Maybelline ultra liner
waterproof liquid liner that I use
everyday except today cuz I'm wearing
mascara and then the NYX jumbo eye
pencil in milk which I actually do use
every single day and I put this on my
waterline how exciting that is it's just
a ball it just makes me happy that was
everything in that bag bag is my brushes
brushes I don't think this is gonna be
too entertaining so I'm just gonna show
them to you really quick Sigma flat top
kabuki brush what I use everyday hair
but I use everyday for blending out my
liquid foundation this is the f80 elf
powder brush blush brush and contour
brush right here eyes I have two of the
elf shader brushes one of the BH
Cosmetics blending brush one of the elf
defining eye brushes and the Sigma
tapered blending brush II forty then the
Urban Decay Naked 2 palette just because
I really like two of the colors in there
and that's about it
honestly I use
bourbon pistol which are these two
colors right here is everything in my
eye Matt's makeup bag I know it's a
little ridiculous don't need all that
make out I never know if these videos
are entertaining because I don't know I
like watching them this is probably the
only time you guys are ever gonna see
what's in my makeup bag video because I
never touch up my makeup throughout the
day so the only time I actually have a
makeup bag is when I'm traveling really
excited for IMATS I'm excited to meet a
bunch of people that I talked to on
YouTube and why is this leave so much
higher than this sleeve alright I need
to go now stairs
so it is actually Saturday night right
now the day of IMATS and I am filming
back at home obviously you know
background it's the same I'm like super
 exhausted so I think I'm just
gonna show you guys what I got today and
then maybe talk about IMATS and
everything like that
I'll film that tomorrow and then compact
this into one video so if the lighting
isn't great it's because I'm using a
construction light so here's my lovely
I'm Matt's bag which I'm gonna keep for
like my whole entire life I don't know
why I just really like the bag it's so
appealing and they were out of them when
we first got there and I was like oh
hell no then we checked back like two
hours later and they restocked is what
the MS bag looks like it's like bigger
than my whole body I didn't get that
much stuff at IMATS I didn't really
think I was going to I was going there
more to like meet the girls I talked to
and meet people and just like for the
overall experience I did pick up a few
things mostly like brushes my
battery's dying charge it or should I
try and do it really fast
I'm gonna charge it that's how much I
love you guys I'm gonna charge it so
charge the battery for about two minutes
and then got too bored and anxious so
probably gonna have to repeat that
process in about two minutes okay so
when we first walked in there was like
this makeup brush place with like super
cheap brushes and it turns out there
were like 25 of those in the showcase
room but we didn't know that okay so we
both got brushes at the first one I
don't have a stippling brush so I got a
like blush stippling brush that was a
tongue twister and it's by the brand
royal and langnickel I don't know I
think that's who sponsored this how
it is oh yeah what up sponsors maybe
they should have an easier name to
pronounce if they're gonna sponsor an
event just saying it's a stippling blush
brush I think Oh 750 oh it was six
dollars the next thing I got is this
brush from CC fashion brush calm is
their website gel eyeliner brush yeah
it's supposed to be bent it's not like
broken or some this was only a
dollar so I was like huh yeah
my favorite purchase
the day and it's this pink brush from I
don't even know who it's from it doesn't
say on the handle but it's this blush
brush that's pink clearly and I just
like that as pink kind of makes me want
to like go eat them freaking cotton
candy or some and that was only 250
I don't know if I said that but okay
then the next thing I got is this pin
just has really good pigmentation I mean
you can only find it out I'm at a these
I'm really excited about we went to
Inglot so I got two of their pan
eyeshadows and these you can put in like
their freedom palette which is their
magnetic palette but I have a Z palette
and some other palettes so I just put
the pan straight into those palettes
first color I got is called it's just
388 and it's this like super bright
matte royal blue color and it is so
freakin pigmented I was like I don't
know when I'm ever gonna wear this but I
need it in my life I don't know why this
one came in their little box and that
one didn't but they're both pans and
it's the shade 358 and it's just this
gorgeous taupe purple color I looked on
their website when we got back to my
friend's house and these are usually I
think it was like $12 a piece and I got
both of them for $10 the last brush I
got I know I went like brush crazy and I
don't even need brushes like I don't
know why I got this many brushes but
they were so cheap like I had to baby
kabuki brush like how freaking cute is
that it's so tiny but it's super super
dense and I asked him and it's synthetic
bristles so you can use this with liquid
foundation and this is crown brush and
this I got for $4 water do you have to
stay hydrated at IMATS gotta push all
those girls out of the way by the way
while we're talking about shoving chicks
out of the way we are freaking standing
at Inglot and this lady is like hover
crafting above all of the eyeshadows
like dude can I just see that one shade
so the last thing I got it I'm ass I
went to Oberon decay and I was trying to
get the D slick setting spray but they
sold out but it was really cool they
gave me a promo code to use online for
40% off because Urban Decay everything
was 40% off I almost shat my pants but
the one thing I got
is actually in The Naked 2 palette and I
think is really unique is the light gray
champagne color and the Naked 2 palette
and this is one color that if I ran out
in the Naked 2 palette I would
repurchase knees were 10 80 at the booth
instead of like 18 something the lady
said normal retail that was everything
that I got at IMATS this is the book
they gave us like that's cool that's
creepy as like think you gonna have
nightmares for a year about that one
thumbs up if you like this and I'll see
you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
