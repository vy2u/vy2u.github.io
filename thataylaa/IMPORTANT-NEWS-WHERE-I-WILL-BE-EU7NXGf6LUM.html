you guys it's good and bad I haven't
been putting it off well I've kind of
been putting it off it's like a good
kind of bad news if that's possible so
if you've been following me on Twitter
Instagram you might have kind of picked
up on it but I will be studying abroad
in Jordan for nine months starting
September 1st I'm going to kind of break
down this video explaining everything
what that means for YouTube what that
means for you guys telling you about
what I'm gonna be doing in Jordan things
like that so if you want to fast-forward
to a certain part then just look in the
downbar everything's gonna be down there
so I'm going to start out by telling you
what that means for YouTube since I'm
guessing that's why most of you are
watching this if you want to know about
Jordan where what I'm going to be doing
then it'll be at the end so I've known
since about May that I was going to be
studying abroad for pretty much a year
this has been really difficult for me
because you're like I'm just kind of
getting started on YouTube and like
picking up the pace and having a lot of
fun I love making videos and I didn't
want to just cut all that off because
I'm gonna be studying abroad so
basically I had the idea for this summer
to pre-record 30 videos was my goal so
that would be about one video a week I'd
put them on private and then schedule
them to come off private while I'm in
Jordan once a week so you guys would
have something to watch while I'm gone
for nine months so that was the plan
that is extremely difficult to do it's
summer I have a full-time internship I
had some family issues with my
grandmother and it just didn't work out
how I expected it to I don't think
people understand how long it takes to
film and edit a single video there were
days this summer when I spent about nine
hours filming and editing trying to get
videos up for you guys now like during
the summer and also pre recording ones
for while I'm going to be gone it's just
extremely difficult so basically I've
been recording as
videos I can in one day switching
outfits so you can't tell trying to edit
those and get them up before I leave in
about three weeks so far I'll be able to
upload a video about once every two
weeks for you guys throughout the nine
months I'm trying to pop out some more
before I leave so I can get them up more
frequently than that but I want you guys
to know that I honestly tried my hardest
with the things that happened this
summer crops to daily vloggers because I
honestly don't know how they film and
edit every single day it takes so much
time and energy and seriously good job
to you guys so right now I hope you
can't hear my dad's a whole laugh in
there so right now like I said there'll
be a video every couple weeks it was
really important to me that I have
something to put up for you guys I
appreciate your support and I hope you
stay with me through this nine months
the reason why I pre-recorded videos
instead of recording them in Jordan is
there will most likely not be internet
in that in the place I'm staying at
there's internet in the café's and on
campus where I'm going to be studying
but I don't know if that's gonna be
enough Internet to upload a video which
takes like three to five hours in
America so it'd probably take like two
weeks in Jordan so I didn't want to get
there and be like oh I don't have
any internet I can't upload a video and
then have me be screwed and you guys be
screwed so I tried to kind of pre
prepare for this situation I'm crossing
my fingers that I can upload in Jordan
because I think would be really cool to
do like Jordan vlogs or Jordan updates
like study abroad updates and that kind
of thing so I can talk to you guys like
actual time and I know I can Skype from
there so I'm thinking I might be able to
do like some blog TVs so I can talk to
you guys live from across the world I
think that'd be pretty awesome so let me
know down below if you want Jordan vlogs
or updates or things like that for the
videos I pre-recorded I've left a like 8
second blank space at the end of each
video where in an annotation while I'm
in Droid and I'm trying I'm going to try
and just type
quick-like paragraph of what I'm doing
how my experience is so far stuff like
that so you guys can kind of feel like
involved in the whole experience I guess
as far as Instagram Twitter Facebook
still talk to me still tweet me I'm
going to be checking everything I may
not get back to you within the same day
um but I will get back to you
but yeah so I just wanted you guys to
know that I'm not disappearing from the
face of the earth so that's what it
means for you guys check the down bar
because I'm probably going to forget
something and I'll type it down there
okay so now I'm going to tell you about
what I'm doing in Jordan why I'm going
to Jordan where Jordan is if some of you
don't know because a lot of people don't
and things like that so if you don't
know my major is International Studies
as part of my major they require us to
study abroad in a foreign country where
our area study is so I'm learning Arabic
and my focus is development work in the
Middle East so if you follow the news at
all you know that Jordan is one of the
few places that is like semi mostly safe
right now in the Middle East
Jordan is next to Israel in Europe so
it's right in the middle of everything
pretty much
I personally am not scared for my safety
or anything like that if you've watched
any of my older videos I said in the
nineteen random facts table tag I'll
link it right here I said that I studied
abroad in Israel for five months in high
school so I've been in that part of the
world I've been in different cultures
languages things like that I'm not
really worried about that or the safety
or anything like that people live there
every day yeah things happen yeah it's
not as safe as America clearly or other
countries but things can happen anywhere
and my kind of perspective on all this
is can't let that hold you back from
going where you want to go or doing what
you want to do because things can happen
anywhere so I'm going with a program
there's I think there's about 100 other
college kids from different countries
Australia Europe America everywhere so
after the week-long orientation I'm
going to be assigned a host family which
I'll be living
for first semester second semester I'll
probably moving in to move into an
apartment once I know the area and
people and things like that I will be
going to school they're taking intensive
Arabic classes and just other classes
for my major probably be traveling a lot
planning on going to Israel Turkey
Morocco possibly Egypt if things get a
little better dad don't watch this so
we'll see this is going to be an
experience and I'm so excited because
I'm the type of person where I can't be
like sitting in the same place for like
more than a year I just get bored so
I'll be posting where I am and stuff on
Twitter and Facebook so if you live in
any of those countries that I just said
definitely contact me and we can do like
a meet-up across the world that'd be
pretty damn cool so yeah I'm going to be
there September through the end of May
and then I may do some more traveling at
the end I don't really know I think
that's everything I wanted to say about
what I'm gonna be doing alright so now
my kind of thoughts on everything
alright obviously we have lives other
than YouTube YouTube is not my job I
don't plan on ever solely depending on
YouTube for my job I wouldn't personally
feel satisfied with that I'm the type of
person that I if I could I would have
like three different jobs just because
I'm interested in a lot of different
stuff and I get bored so basically I
decided I was studying abroad before I
even started YouTube not that YouTube
has changed the fact that I want to
study abroad at all like I said you
can't put your life on hold for YouTube
especially when that's my goal career
working in the Middle East it's just
hard knowing that there's going to be
like things going on here different
things happening on YouTube like just
small things that you don't think about
it's really hard to think ahead of what
you guys will want to see nine months
from now and what's going to be like
happening at that time basically I've
put so much hard work into this channel
and I put a lot of
effort and editing time and filming time
into every single video that I put up
and I hope you guys appreciate that and
I hope you kind of understand if some of
the videos that I'm putting up aren't as
exciting or funny or whatever because
like I said it's really hard to do that
when you're filming five videos in a day
I know I'm forgetting some like big
point that I wanted to make but like I
said check the down bar because I'm
probably going to forget things and type
it in there let me know if you'd be
interested in like live videos from
Jordan our blog TVs
I've also I have no idea what it's gonna
be like when I'm actually there and how
much time I'm gonna have but I've been
thinking about starting a blog and
documenting my travels there and telling
you guys like where I am pictures things
like that so if you would be interested
in that then comment below and let me
know I know I'm forgetting something
damn it I was told longest pause ever
and I thought about absolutely nothing
yeah that's basically everything I
wanted to say thank you guys I don't
know how to wrap this up make sure you
still tweet me and talk to me and
everything like I said I'm gonna be
checking everything I appreciate you
guys I'm thankful for you guys and I
will hopefully see you from a like live
video or blog TV soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
