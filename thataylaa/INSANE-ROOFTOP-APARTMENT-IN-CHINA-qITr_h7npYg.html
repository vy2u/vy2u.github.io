gonna stay in his apartment tonight and
I'm just gonna chill here and enjoy the
bathtub I'm going to show you guys a
room tour because this is freakin insane
let's just do this so you walk in beds
right there there's a glass-enclosed
toilet and bathtub right there like
literally in the middle of the room
there's a little coffee I got cheesecake
to go there's some coffee and stuff over
there
here's the bed there's a huge s TV the
Airbnb host when he showed us this room
literally went over every single
American TV show and American movie on
here when he showed us the room we got
the TV dialed in coolest part about this
bed is the mirror up here giant ass
mirror on the ceiling you know that's
for and then here's the bath I'm
actually going to take a bath tonight I
haven't taken a bath in so long I
literally only do when I'm in like
hotels sinks literally right above the
toilet there's me there's like in a
little lobby area out there kind of with
a couple of their units oh there's
another bathroom if you want to use that
one and don't want to like you know pee
in the middle of nowhere but it's
actually really cool because you can go
the bathroom and you have this view
probably the coolest room I've ever
stayed in you have a little chair over
here closet and then I'll show you guys
the deck think I got some footage out
here earlier but now it's salon
nighttime out here might be quiet cuz
there's neighbors I know why doesn't
want to focus right now there's
beautiful stools out here telescope
and then this chair which I want so
beautiful
I could just sit out here for hours I
was just reading a book out here we've
been staying on that side right now
we're on Sudan I believe keep the other
side of the river but I think I should
talk to you guys because I haven't
really talked blog double lot to strip
but so far it's amazing it's totally
different than I was expecting some
reason I thought it was going to be like
a ton of people everywhere in just
super past it's actually pretty spread
out I feel like when I walk down the
street here there's actually less people
on the streets then like in Seattle
downtown it doesn't feel super intense
and it's super green like there's parks
everywhere we went biking one of the
days through this park and there's a
huge lake and it's like miles and miles
long and would say this is one of those
places where it's so much easier to have
someone who lives here that can show you
around because feeling normally you can
kind of get by in a country even if you
don't know the language just by body
language and like figuring it out but it
really feels like there's not a lot of
people who know English here especially
just going into restaurants or getting
food on the street or whatever so it's
been super nice to have our word to just
do everything pretty much and we just
like chill and follow along
everything is dirt cheap here the food
even same the taxis are super cheap or
you can take these bikes the bikes that
we did through the park I think 20 cents
an hour and you can drop them off
anywhere you just use an app and then
you can pick them up anywhere and write
em why is the number say do you have
that and then the place of urbanized
stadium yesterday what you guys saw was
just everything about that place was
amazing in a super good location like
everything about it was just perfection
so I think I'm just gonna facemask it up
Phoebe who I met at the bar she actually
gave me a shit-ton a face mask she good
so sweet Phoebe you did not have to do
this she gave me a giant bag of
different face masks I did this one but
it was silver I did that in our Airbnb
yesterday so I might do a different one
this was definitely just done manual so
I hope it wasn't out of focus that I'm
tired I'm soo packaging is speaking to
me can I do this one I also picked up
some stuff from etude house you into the
store the other day
nothing i'ma show you guys cause I kinda
wanna do like a first impressions kind
of video other than that we haven't
really done any shopping or anything yet
tomorrow we're going to the fake market
I want to get some Nikes I want to get
Idina stuff and it's all like hella
cheap it's a fake so I think I'm just
going to chill in the back turn out the
lights look at the view and have a
relaxing night so I'll talk to you guys
tomorrow
look at how cool this looks with the
lights off I need a lush bath bomb up in
here so crazy so I got the bath like a
third filled up with hot water and then
the hot water totally ran out and it's
like freezing cold except there for like
30 minutes trying to get it back to hot
so now I'm using the water heater and
boiling water and pouring it in the
bathtub 500 times it's like sort of
black now I used to shower around Jordan
