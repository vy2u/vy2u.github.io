for more than two seconds that would be
fantastic all right so today it is
foundation Friday so I try out a new
foundation every single Friday on my
channel I am feeling very festive very
excited we got the holiday background
going on I kind of want to just keep
this year round I'm feeling it so I was
very excited when I saw that Maybelline
was relaunching the superstay foundation
because I actually had the old one here
this has been one of my favorite
foundations for years if you go back to
I think like one of my first few videos
back in the day this used to be one of
my favorites I used to wear this every
single day when I self-tan or I would
mixes in with products but this
foundation was freaking beautiful I was
so bummed when they discontinued this
but they reformulated it and they are
back this is the maybelline superstay
full coverage foundation it says up to
24 hours throughout this video I'm kind
of comparing both of these just because
I've used this for so many years I know
how this one is and this is a
reformulation so I ordered this online
Ulta I feel like you have to sneeze oh
yeah it's coming so I ordered this
online Ulta so I couldn't actually see
the shades but I got the lightest shade
102 fair porcelain so there's not a
whole lot of claims on altas website but
it just says it provides an ultra
transforming effect long lasting
foundation lightweight yet high-impact
coverage glides onto skin lasts all day
blah blah says on the bottle it's full
coverage and it retails for $11.99 on
ulties website you get one fluid ounce
product which is standard this comes in
16 shades and 102 fair porcelain which
is the legislature said that is quite a
bit lighter than the lightest shade of
this foundation like I'm talking for
five shades lighter which is awesome I
hope that the deepest shade on here is
actually deep i minister swatches here
as a lighter shade 102 fair porcelain
but I can tell ya this is a fair
drugstore foundation which is awesome
it's too light for me you guys will see
in the demo had to like warm up my face
a shit-ton with bronzer
alright so swatch time right here is the
new version of the maybelline superstay
foundation
in the lightest shade 102 fair porcelain
here's the old version of the maybelline
superstay in sand beige pretty sure
there's one technically lighter shade in
the old formula but it was very similar
to this it was just more kind of orange
II so quite a big shade difference there
so that's awesome Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless foundation in 110
derma call to 0-8 covergirl vitalist
and lightest shade 705 which is way dark
and then the CYO life proof foundation
in 1:01 so that's all the claims if
you're excited for foundation Friday
don't forget to give this a thumbs up if
you're new here you can join the BAE
radio family and subscribe I upload
every Monday Wednesday Friday at 6 p.m.
Pacific time now I feel like I have to
hiccup and sneeze this is this is a new
feeling if you want to see what I think
of the new Maybelline foundation how to
apply somewheres throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching look at all the lights
alright so I've already washed
moisturized and primed my face I'm gonna
have everything I used link down below
so we didn't have to go into that I am
so freakin excited to try this one today
because like I probably told you in the
intro I used to be obsessed with this
foundation such a pretty like skin like
sat in a little bit dewy kind of
finished
I feel like this foundation was totally
underrated so I'm really curious how the
formulas gonna compare to the new one
and you guys have already seen swatches
but just looking from the bottle I
haven't done the swatches yet looking in
the bottle this one is obviously quite a
bit lighter I'm gonna give this a shake
this thing does have a pump which is
also exciting yay for pumps I'm gonna do
half my face with my la girl star sponge
and then the other half with the Sigma
f80 three curved kabuki think it's
actually really nice it just like hugs
your face what I want to start with
siddur it with a brush on the side of my
face I have is it right on the center of
my forehead this is definitely the
lightest Maybelline foundation thus far
I can tell you that much looks like I
think I actually could have gone a shade
up great coverage oh it's looking pretty
dry on my skin right now this definitely
off the bat looks much more matte than
the old formula ooh
it is emphasizing all of my dryness over
here not even emphasizing I don't even
have dryness on my cheek right now it
is making my skin look super super dry
over here my skin right now is very well
moisturized I am on accutane so my skin
is dry I'm not combo anymore but I am
using so many products and prepping my
skin that I really haven't experienced
like the major dryness so that's good it
looks very very dry all over in here
let's keep going yeah I definitely could
have gotten up a shade wow this is a
great problem to have good job
Maybelline
alright I'm hoping this one looks better
with a sponge on the other side with the
brush I would say low full coverage I
can still see stuff coming through but
full coverage this right now is looking
very matte on my skin I'm just smoothing
out this side with the sponge too so
this side definitely looks better like
less dry with the sponge I'm not getting
quite as much weird dryness going on and
the forehead definitely looks better got
a little bit better coverage with the
brush I mean you can still see stuff
coming through over here the site is not
looking too hot so right now I am
getting a clip on the other camera so
I'm gonna get really up close so you can
hopefully see other way the dryness I'm
talking about okay think this thing gets
out of focus really easily so hopefully
this isn't focus because I can't really
tell very dry looking all around here
doesn't want greater on my nose either
here's this sponge side as you can see
there's still definitely stuff coming
through all over here say it looks
slightly better than the other side but
it still doesn't look like good making
my forehead look super dry on this side
like that does not look good at all
sponge side definitely looks better but
still doesn't look great so what I'm
gonna do now is take a little bit more
on the sponge see if we can just build
this up a little bit see if I can smooth
out the brush side at all I'm just
focusing this where my acne is and
everything I'm not going like right
around my nose
oh this looks bad this looks really bad
I would say off the bat if you have dry
skin or even the slightest amount of
dryness not for you I'm looking white
right now
okay so right now it's 9:30 a.m. so
that's when we're gonna call the
check-in time like I said in last week's
video
haven't been powdering my face feels
actually like a powder finish yeah this
is totally different than this
foundation feels like it's set down yeah
my forehead feels like totally dry right
now I'm definitely preferring this
formula filming this on Tuesday this
videos going up on Friday
obviously foundation Friday but I'm
gonna try this one again just so I can
see with my skin right now how this one
sits on it and I'll update you guys in
the description box how that goes I wish
they just made this same exact formula
in more shades I don't even know why
they discontinued it in the first place
but whatever just a little bitter right
now so I'm gonna try and warm up my face
so I don't look completely ghostly today
I do have some errands to run and things
so yeah I'm just gonna go ham with the
bronzer today I think the check-in time
is 9:30 I'm gonna do the rest of my
makeup and I'll be right back so it's
now 1006 rest of my makeup is on I think
it's looking a little better still way
too light I don't know what is happening
on my nose right now the foundation has
just like rubbed off in a couple spots
oddly so I'm gonna try and just smooth
that out my pores are like extremely
emphasized on my nose what is going on
it was fine
blending product on top it just kind of
felt like I was blending on top of the
powder as far as how everything's
looking on my face really don't like how
it looks right now this side looks okay
this side and my forehead is kind of
just a total disaster
it looks fine from far away I mean it
just looks like I have foundation
sitting on top of my face major major
dryness weird things going on around my
pores don't know what's happening on my
nose I mean I've never really had that
happen so that's that I think you know
how I feel about the foundation right
now now I need to like hoard this
foundation and only use a drop of it
each time because I'm almost out I'm
like down to here so the makeup on the
rest of my face for bronzer I use the
hourglass diffuse bronze light this is
one of my favorite bronzers but I want
to just
overall warm up my face so I just kind
of put that everywhere like around my
temples on my cheeks down here a little
bit just tried to warm up my face a
little bit and I also used the hourglass
incandescent Electra blush which looks
like this it looks kind of scary like
flamingo pink in the pan but it's really
pretty yet on your face just for like a
pink blush and then for highlight I used
one of my all-time favorites Physicians
Formula shimmer brick in natural nude
that's what my face Haley is I also use
this on the inner corner of my eyes or
eye shadow I use the morphe 39a palace
so ginormous I did a shadow and she was
using this it was like the army green
look I just went in with some of these
shades right here in the middle is that
one which was gorgeous and I also used
that shade right there the shimmer
shades in here are so they almost feel
like a wet metallic I didn't wet my
brush at all this pal is actually really
nice there hasn't been a shade that I
haven't liked in here so far and then
for lips this was just like not a good
Maybelline day I tried to use Maybelline
matte ink again this is in the shade 15
lover and it's just transferring
everywhere it was like bleeding out a
little bit over here I think you can see
it then I ended up putting my blinked
aura over top which is one of my
favorite shades right now super super
pretty I just put that like on the
center I think that's it my usual
mascaras which will be linked down below
I was gonna film November rays and
rejects today I don't think that's gonna
happen unless I like redid my entire
makeup right now so that's that the next
I gonna do will be a natural lighting
I'll see you guys in a few hours all
right so it's 3:20 so it's been on for
almost 6 hours right now I want to wash
off my face so bad
took off my lipsticks I've just been
coating my lips and aquaphor but this is
a no this is a no actually looking
better on camera I think is it's like a
little bit bright right now there we go
if I had one word I would just say
crusty like my face looks hella crusty
right now I feel like that might be some
like slang term but I can't remember
what it means but I mean like literal
crusty it looks weird not even dry like
what is that it just looks bizarre and
like on my nose and then over here it
looks dry I mean
sponge I definitely looks better it's
also rubbed off a shit-ton right here I
think that's where I was like resting my
arm I mean my acne is like full-on out
right here my forehead doesn't look
quite as bad I feel like as it did
earlier like blending right now so it's
seven o'clock so it's been on for almost
almost ten hours nine and a half hours
and wow I look I look fabulous right now
ready good on the town I think I'm just
gonna wipe off all my makeup to go this
thing because I would rather wear no
makeup at this point everything looks
the same as last check-in except around
my nose area now looks worse and I'm
also getting creasing on my upper lip
okay so creating here creasing around
the nose this just looks weird funky
funky more weird and funky yeah as far
as the formula this it reminds me
nothing of the other formula so if you
liked that there for me a lot I don't
know you might love this one or you
might hate this one but they are totally
different I'm surprised actually called
to the same thing because to me these
are nothing alike so I wouldn't wear
this one again I don't even think I
would mix this really doesn't sit well
on my skin at all I am NOT a fan and I'm
bummed because the other one was so
friggin good but just like I say with
every foundation not everything works
the same for everyone so you might love
this you might have great experience
with it I'll update you down below but
if you guys enjoyed this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up I got to
breath right now just a Chipotle I love
you guys thanks for watching see my next
