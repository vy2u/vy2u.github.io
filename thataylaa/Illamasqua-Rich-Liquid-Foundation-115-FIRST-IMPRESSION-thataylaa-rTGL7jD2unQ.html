foundation today we have a first
impressions video on the illamasqua rich
liquid foundation I'm so excited to
finally be filming this because this
foundation has been sitting in my to
review pile for literally probably two
months so the reason why I initially
picked this up was it was before I
discovered the Manic Panic dreamtone
which is like my go-to Lightner
foundation liner to make my foundation
lighter without necessary so a couple
months ago I was like on the hunt for
good foundations for fair skin and ella
masca makes an amazing range of shades
from super super light almost white to
foundations for deeper skin tones so
that's something that I really
appreciate in a company obviously a
little bit lighter than the average
human being I was a little bit skeptical
to buy this because it is freakin pricey
probably the most expensive foundation
that I have ever bought if you watch any
of my videos you know that I'm usually
an elf drugstore kind of girl so this
was like going into new territory for me
this foundation retails for 39 to like
$42 which is you know a big chunk of
money but I wanted to try it out for you
guys and see if it's worth it this is in
the shade RF 115 have it up on my phone
so I'm trying to okay so the lighter
shade is shade 100 and it is completely
white this one is the second lightest
shade and then the darkest shade goes
335 there are 15 shades and this is
supposed to be a completely full
coverage foundation it says that it
provides maximum long-lasting coverage
without feeling or looking heavy it
blends easily to hide problem areas and
create a natural finish so if you want
to see if I agree with that then you can
keep watching
probably clip back the hair it says to
apply using an illamasqua brush not
everyone has an ill masca brush so we're
going to work with what we have
I'm going to use the Real Techniques
miracle complexion sponge because I've
been obsessed with this I've been using
it every day no matter what foundation
I'm using so it comes in this little
squeeze bottle which is nice I hate
having to like pour it out on the back
of your hand so I'm just going to
squeeze a little bit on the back it says
it's full coverage so I'm not going to
take too much to start also kind of feel
like I'm squeezing gold onto my hand
right now because it stuff is so frickin
expensive so I'm just stippling it in
with my sponge and then let's just let's
go for it
okay so it is like super freaking thick
clearly pretty light I think once we add
blush and bronzer and stuff it'll be
okay but this is really like kind of
rocking the Casper look right now it
kind of smells like vanilla yeah what
the heck it smells like birthday cake
not the easiest to blend out I'm kind of
putting a lot of pressure onto the
sponge here's the side of my face
without makeup obviously and here's with
the out fill mask of foundation as far
as coverage goes I mean it covered up
everything it's like clinging on to some
of my dry patches over here and under
the eyes it looks kind of funky it's
like settling in all of my lines I do
like how light it is just because that's
really rare to find in a foundation I
wouldn't have to mix this with my Manic
Panic because it is light enough by
itself I'm going to apply the rest of my
face and I still have like half of what
I use so you really just need a tiny bit
the consistency kind of feels like I'm
putting on a concealer in a way like
it's that thick okay I'm starting to
feel like ghostly white right now we're
gonna have to put on some major major
bronzer so I have my full face done I'm
looking pretty scary right now I'm going
to put on the rest of my makeup and hope
that I can kind of tone down this like
stark white okay so I obviously have the
rest of my makeup on if you want to see
the look that I'm wearing right now I
will have a get ready with me video up
after this one so you can see that there
so obviously I got it to tone down a
little bit we're looking like a normal
human being again I've got to say I am
NOT a fan of the finish it's completely
matte but more than that I feel like
it's completely like emphasizing my
pores you can see all of my pores around
here my forehead looks like super
textured
it's kind of like clinging to every
possible thing it can on my face I feel
like I'm wearing full coverage
foundation and for me that's a lot to
say because I pretty much wear full
coverage foundation on a daily basis but
it
feels like heavy like I don't know how
to scrap it I feel it on my face as far
as their blending out claim I do think
it highs problem areas I don't think it
blends out easily at all and I don't
agree with the fact that it doesn't look
or feel heavy I think it pretty much
does both I think this would be good to
mix in with another foundation for that
added coverage and lightness but then
again I have my Manic Panic to do the
same thing and this is $12 versus $39 I
do really appreciate the fact that
Illamasqua has such a wide range of
shades and recognizes that not everyone
falls in the same 5 skin colors
props to Illamasqua on that everything
else I'm not that much of a fan of we'll
see how it lasts throughout the day but
to be honest like I I feel like I'm
wearing a mask right now it is almost
5:00 p.m. so it's been about 4 hours now
with the foundation on and I feel like
it almost looks better now it's kind of
like settled into my skin maybe just
because it looks a little bit more dewy
now but my blush and everything is still
completely on it's starting to like
settle in the lines above my lips but
that's about it
so it is now 10:10 p.m. and I feel like
the foundation is looking increasingly
shitty
super oily on my forehead you can see
like my little wrinkles we have going on
here super oily around my nose it's
starting to like come off on my nose and
then also on my forehead up here in
general I think this would be a good
foundation to mix with other foundations
if you want a little bit more coverage
but I'll probably never be wearing this
again by itself it just wasn't that
amazing to me and it definitely wasn't
worth $40 in my opinion so that was
everything if you guys liked this video
and it was helpful for you be sure to
click the thumbs up button so I know
comment down below with any other
foundations that you would like me to do
a first impressions video on and we can
do that love you guys thanks for
watching see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
