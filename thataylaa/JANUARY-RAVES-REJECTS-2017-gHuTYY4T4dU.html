stick that looks like an Olympic torch
all right so today we are doing January
raisin rejects I cannot believe it's
February what the heck it feels like it
should still be December I am NOT
mentally prepared for spring can we
rewind feeling interesting today I've
had like four cups of coffee I'm on a
muscle relaxant right now I need to put
food in my stomach but we are doing this
I didn't have a December Raisin rejects
last month because my yearly favourites
went up like I always say I do not take
rays and rejects videos lightly if I
want to recommend something it's not
something that I just used a couple
times within the last week these are
products that I have put to the test
that I've used a lot and that I actually
have reached for a ton this month this
month is a little bit different because
I actually have I think I might have
more rejects than I do Ray's January was
a month of new releases there were so
many new drugstore releases high-end
releases tons of new products came out
this month pretty much every day I feel
like I was trying out a new product
either on camera or off camera I also
did two drugstore first impressions
videos which I will also put one in the
cart down here and both of them down
below in the description box love when
words come out such a boring coffee cup
today so let's jump into the raves of
the month we're starting out with
Physicians Formula butter blushes I
loved the formula of the butter bronzer
but the shade pulled super orange for me
so I never reach for that one but I love
these blushes they're super subtle you
can build them up I have the shade plum
rose which is this kind of like mauve
one and then also natural glow this one
looks more peachy on me both of these do
give you a glow if you like more matte
blushes this is not the product for you
these really do give you a pretty glow I
feel like they just blend into your
bronzer and highlight really nicely kind
of like evens everything out I'm wearing
plum rose on my face today and they
smell like banana boat sunscreen which I
oddly like it makes me feel like I need
to go on vacation my go-to foundation
combo this month when I'm not filming or
trying out different foundations it was
definitely the Clinique beyond
perfecting foundation and concealer and
my stargazer white foundation I mix
these two together I like mixing with
stargazer better with this foundation
over a Manic Panic for some reason these
two formulas just go really well
together this product I have an older
review on but it is full coverage
there's something about the way that it
blends out that is just so easy to apply
and quick it has a huge-ass one this is
like the heart-shaped tape one but on a
foundation I was just in Texas for a few
days to visit Mallory 17/12 and this was
the only foundation that I brought this
is what I was wearing everyday it's just
one of those foundations that I know is
going to look good no matter what 0.5
breeze is the shade I have this one is
too dark on its own which is why I mix
in a light nurse I'm wearing this combo
right now you guys will see in
Wednesday's video I'm actually filming a
first impression today on primers
underneath here but you have on this
Foundation and I normally set it with a
cosmetic celebration foundation
illumination powder stays on all day
looks beautiful so this product I
remember talking about while ago on
snapchat I don't think I've ever
mentioned this on my channel but this
one has kind of resurfaced this month I
don't know why I randomly reach for this
but once I did I've just been using this
a ton this is the polished choice blush
it on contour palette polished choice
makeup is super hit or miss for me but
this palette is surprisingly good this
bronzer shade looks like it would be too
dark but if you use a light hand it has
the reddish tone to it which I love I
hate oranjee bronzers if you like the
more brown red toned bronzer look this
one is great and it blends out really
easily the other favorite in here is
just highlight shade this highlight
shade I've also been using a ton which
surprised me because it looks like
nothing exciting in the pan but when you
put it on your face this is a very
subtle natural but glowy kind of
highlight I've been kind of on the hunt
for a highlight like this this month
where it just doesn't look like too much
I like the blush shades I'm not super
into them because they're really
pigmented so you do have to use either a
stippling brush or a lighter hand with
the blushes they're not bad they're just
too pigmented for my liking but I do
really like the bronzer shade in here
and the highlight I've still been
getting questions about my favorite face
mask and how I whitened my team aid to
videos on both those topics this month
if you missed those a length and down
below I made a pamper products video but
and my skincare routine but I mentioned
this mask in that video and I love this
thing I really feel like this has helped
my skin a lot this is the origins
10-minute mask out of trouble or you can
actually use this as a spot treatment
and sleep in it which I've also done I
definitely notice a difference in my
open acne I don't think it's really
helped prevent acne from coming but when
I do have to open ask me where it's like
needs to heal this really helps make
them smaller and dry them up a little
bit I love the smells if it smells like
mental a demet smells
what's exactly like Mentholatum if
you've ever used that when you're sick
it's a super stick white pace kind of
looks like toothpaste but a little bit
thicker and it has like a cooling
sensation I just love everything about
this mask this pur cosmetics trolls
palette totally took me by surprise I
don't know why just looking at this I
wasn't super excited about it but as
soon as I started actually using it
these are beautiful the pigmentation is
amazing with these they don't blend away
but they're easy to blend all the
eyeshadows I'm wearing today are from
this palette I brought this to Texas
with me it was the only eyeshadow
palette I brought there are some really
nice warm shades this transition shade
this shade wisdom is a perfect
transition shade if you're around my
skin tones fuzzy it's a beautiful warm
orange color it's in my crease right now
the only thing I don't like is that this
white shimmery shade and also the shade
Brigitte they look just like shimmery
white and light pinks but they are major
duochrome this white one looks almost
blue purple when it's on your eyes and
that's great but it's hard to make kind
of a comprehensive look out of this
palette sometimes I wish they had a
lighter under the brow bone kind of
shade or for your inner corner because
there really isn't an inner corner of
shade in this palette I just think they
killed it with the formula Z's I'm not
sure if this is a limited edition I'm
guessing it is because it looks like a
collaboration with DreamWorks one of my
all-time favorite perfume sense is
Elizabeth and James Nirvana bourbon it
smells so fricking good I have to roller
balls one in my purse in one at home and
this is the Elizabeth and James Nirvana
black scented dry shampoo this smells
like a perfume if you're going to be
putting this in your hair you do not
need to wear perfume that day I like it
because I feel like this stays on my
body better than perfume does I can put
this in my hair in the morning and the
next morning I still smell it in my hair
it stays in really well it's actually a
really good dry shampoo too it doesn't
have a white cast this is the travel
size because I just want to test it out
but go in Sephora and smell this oh my
god it smells so good they need to make
a candle out of this because I would
burn that 24/7 so I just have a couple
of products to mention if you've seen
any of my videos this month you probably
saw this one coming this is the MUA
luminizing lip gloss and baby pink you
can get this from CVS I despise the
smell of this one because it smells very
chemically it doesn't have a scent at
all just smells like chemicals but the
color of this is so beautiful for layer
for wearing by itself even if I'm having
no makeup days I'll just put this on to
go out because it gives your list a
really nice clump with a little bit of
color it's not too pink it's not too
orange II it does have color to it it's
really nice for layering like I could
even wear it on top of what I have on
right now doesn't feel sticky it has a
really smooth formula what I'm wearing
right now has been kind of my go-to
combo this month this is colour-pop
ultra matte lips in knotty I'm not a
huge fan of the ultra matte lip formula
they're very drying so if you have dry
lips stay away the ultra satin lips are
much better in my opinion but I love the
shade of this one and what I do is when
it's still drying down I'll put on just
a tiny bit of the Jordana sweet cream
butter cream frosting liquid lipsticks I
just put this right in the center and it
helps to make your lips look a little
bit bigger and more plump I just love
this combo a lot of the colour-pop ones
are a little bit to oranjee on my skin
but this one I feel like is the perfect
balance I just love this shade of mousse
if you've been following my channel for
a while you know my deodorant saga saga
saga why does that sound so weird coming
out I finally found one that works it
doesn't change my clothes colors it
doesn't stain and I just really love
this this is a degree clinical
protection this one sheer powder I just
get whatever's on clearance I really
hope they're not cancelling cancelling
discontinuing this product because every
time I go into CVS one of the cents is
on clearance for like $4.99 my last 3 of
the month is the all May smart shade
powder blush and 20 nude moths pretty
much since the hidden drugstore video
I've been reaching for this a ton I've
either been going between this or the
Physicians Formula blush this is just
such a pretty shade it is a matte blush
and if you want some of the lighter
shades you can just go in with the top
few stripes if you need deeper shades
you can go in with the bottom ones all
Mae is very questionable as a brand you
can google it I do not support what
their brand represents yeah they need to
do some rebranding it's a little bit
frightening it is 2017 alright folks
we're onto the rejects get ready because
there's a lot so my first reject these
were sent as PR these are the Lancome
metallics liquid lipsticks that are
brand new or glosses whatever the heck
these are I don't know if I got a bad
batch or what but I haven't heard a
single person talk about the smell of
these I mean it is like toxic
smelling it's not just a chemical scent
like the anyway lip gloss this is like
something is wrong in here some of them
are worse like this brush gold shade is
horrible I can't even smell this without
wanting to gag and then some of them are
as bad like zero to lavender this one
almost has no scent so it really is only
certain ones which maybe is why I'm not
hearing anyone say anything I don't know
but I am shocked because I mean this is
bad but besides that they're just super
sticky and thick I don't like the
formula Z's another lipstick reject
these are also sent us PR is the Urban
Decay vice liquid lipstick I have a
couple issues with these one a lot of
the ones that say that they're matte are
not mad at all they have like a shimmer
to them I'm not sure what happened there
even shades that are originally matte in
their lipstick formulas when they turn
those exact shades into liquid lipsticks
some of them are not mad at all but are
called matte these just applied super
patchy on me you have to really work to
get these opaque they're pretty sheer
for liquid lipsticks I just had higher
expectations for these they're way
better liquid lipstick formulas out
there I wouldn't say they feel extra
drying but they're just more of a dry
liquid lipstick formula just the fact
that you really have to layer these up
to get a fully opaque lip I would say
pass for me alright this thing what the
heck is this I use this in the drugstore
first impressions video this is a major
reject for me the sponge itself is
pretty shitty it has more of a rubbery
kind of consistency it's not a sponge it
actually gets bigger and is super soft
and then they decided to stick it on a
stick that looks like an Olympic torch I
know other brands have done the stick
makeup sponge situation it just doesn't
make sense to me why do we need a stick
when we can hold the sponge it's just
really impractical because when you go
to actually blend it out the whole thing
Wiggles around so you have no control
over the actual sponge so basically you
have to like put your finger on the back
up here and then try and blend it in it
just doesn't make sense
we don't need sticks on our Reed
blenders so this one is a 74 dollar fail
for me this is the girl on meteorites
brace brace base primer did a whole half
face comparison of this with the Catrice
primer it's not that I think this is a
bad primer by any means it just does the
exact same thing as the Catrice one it
doesn't control my oil anymore
I really don't see how this is worth $74
if you guys in that video said to try
out the gold grill on primer so I might
do that let me know if you'd want to see
that down below but for 74 bucks I don't
know if I would pay 10 bucks for this
uses about three or four times since
that video and I'm just still not
impressed for me personally this one was
a reject I know some people love this
from what I heard in the comments on
this video it sounds like a lot of
people just did not work out for some
people really love it just like any
product these are just my opinions and
my experiences with products something
that I hate you might love and vice
versa so this is the NYX total control
drops foundation I just don't like this
this is not full coverage some of you
were saying maybe they meant four drops
as in for full serum drops like
everything that's in the little dropper
counts as a drop I just don't think
that's the case that's like Tarte
reinforces the C's saying you have to
push out an entire dropper full of
product that seems like a ton of product
for me the coverage isn't there it just
looks dry the formulas I'm just not into
I really like the Maybelline Dream
liquid dream wonder you know I'm talking
about similar foundation I like that one
500 times more than this and this is not
that cheap if you saw the unboxing on
snapchat of this collection you probably
knew this was coming this is the Tuesday
sweet peach palette this is not a bad
product there's nothing wrong with the
formula of the eyeshadows it's more so
what really turns me off from this is
the scent and the color scheme scheme
scheme I can never do that words the
color selection in this palette is very
confusing to me I know it's supposed to
be kind of peachy with the greens and
the oranges and the pinks and all that
but then we have a glittery purple in
here there isn't a dark shade in here
this time is dark brown if you're doing
more of a natural kind of brown
champagne eye yes you can create a whole
eye look in here but if you're doing
anything smokier there's no basic dark
shades in here to use I think they
killed it with the idea of this I love
the idea of the sweet peach collection I
love the packaging of it whole
collection is a really cute idea it just
kind of fell short who this scent smells
like artificial syrup to me almost like
peach cough medicine next reject which I
also did a whole video on is the Philly
sponge I did try this a couple more
times after
making that video this is unnecessary
yes you can apply the product to your
face that having it soak into something
but when it actually comes to blending
like you need to do with your foundation
this is worthless if you want to use
less product just use your hands don't
need a silicon piece of material to do
that so lost rejects with the month is a
covergirl clean matte pressed powder
this one I used in a video and then I
used it probably five more times after
that just to make sure it just makes my
skin look very flaky and almost dry and
this is also when those powders for me
that takes away some of the coverage
certain powders I don't know what it is
but it completely takes away the
coverage of my foundation I don't know
if that's just an acne texture kind of
thing or what let me hope that happens
you down below but there are very few
powders that I can wear that don't do
that to me which is why I usually stick
to my three favorite powders just the
formula the way it sits on my face it
just looks very flaky and dry and I have
combination oily skin so this one is a
no so those are all my raves and rejects
this month I hope you guys like this
video if you did make sure you give it a
thumbs up so I know let me know down
below what your raves
and rejects tell me what you also didn't
like I also want to say YouTube is
having major issues with subscription
feeds and notifications going out and
all this stuff I've emailed them four
times and I get the same canned response
back every single time you don't just
have to subscribe now you have to turn
on the Bell for notifications and now
sometimes even the Bell doesn't work the
notifications don't actually send out so
now is really the time to follow me on
social media because you will definitely
see me posting when new video goes out
on social media to answer our Twitter
Facebook Instagram I always post a new
video goes out so make sure you're
following me on those I'm going to put
my social handles right here so you can
go do that so we can be friends it'll be
fun love you guys thanks for watching
see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
