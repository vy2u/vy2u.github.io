rejects I just filmed a shadow rush
moves on the look I'm wearing right now
so it'll be up after this video so we
don't put our January rays and rejects
up in the end of February what's
happening major technical difficulties
when I started filming today so I'm
using my old lens right now and I can
only see if I'm in focus on the tiny
viewfinder so fingers crossed it's all
good actually have a ton of products
that I wanted to mention this month and
like 99% of them are makeup stuff it was
a good month for new makeup let's just
get started I'm gonna start off with
face products
okay so I've strolling through the
aisles of bartels
like usual I going to get like a light
bulb or something and end up with like
10 makeup products and I'm trying out
the Garnier clean makeup removing lotion
cleanser you guys know I'm like a
die-hard Neutrogena makeup wipe fan I
usually use those for all over my face
and my eye makeup and it takes up
everything I don't know why I decided to
try this I think I was just tired of
like spending so much money on makeup
remover so what I've been doing is just
using the wipes on my eyes and then I go
in with this stuff you don't do anything
I go in with like a full caked on face
of makeup and you literally just start
rubbing it into dry skin and it
completely dissolves everything
literally everything you can use this on
your eyes and your eyebrows and
everything as well it says that it's not
supposed to irritate your eyes I've used
on my eyes a couple times it didn't burn
my eyes or anything but I just like
smudged all the makeup all over my face
I've just been liking it for my face
I've been using way less makeup remover
wipes because of this stuff and it just
leaves your skin feeling really nice and
moisture I'd still use like your face
wash afterwards because it can leave a
little bit of a film
I don't mind it because I just go in
with my african black soap which a lot
of shoe guys recommended and I've been
really liking by the way I just go in
with that stuff and it completely takes
off everything
Tyra some zoomed in I can't focus this
camera we're not this close right now so
whatever every single day this month I
use the Maybelline master prime blur and
illuminate primer I mentioned this a few
times now
this is great this is the only
illuminating primer I found actually
shows through your foundation which is
what I really like about it right now
I'm wearing the Loreal Pro matte
foundation and you can see that like my
face does have an illuminated look it
doesn't look completely matte and that
is totally because of this primer okay
doing okay your should do if you have
oily skin you have to wear like a matte
oil-control foundation but you still
want a little bit of not complete one
dimension on your face I would recommend
trying this stuff out I don't think it
helps with like the lawn GEB one never
remember I say that word it doesn't help
with the longevity of your foundation I
don't find has SPF 30 has a really nice
smell I want this in like lotion form
and I'm enjoying it foundation I've been
wearing pretty much the entire month of
January a kind of shocking to me this is
the Studio Fix fluid by Mac this is NW
10 I have like a love-hate relationship
with this stuff I don't really love the
formula by itself it's just a little too
matte and cakey for me but mixed in with
the elf acne fighting foundation which
is a really nice dewy full coverage
foundation it's like perfect
and not tell for in focus there I have
to makeup revolution products that I've
been obsessed with first is the bronzer
trio this is in the shade ultra fair
ultra brightening contour kit I
mentioned this I don't even know a lot
this month I feel like I mentioned this
in my contour how to highlight contour
video do powder just by applying to the
always have such great pigmentation
they're easy to blend out they're soft
and buttery they're just amazing
especially for the price I think this is
around like eight US dollars I want to
say it's a UK size so you do have to pay
for shipping but if you're gonna order a
bunch of stuff it's totally worth it the
highlight shade in here is freakin
beautiful the blush reminds me of like
NARS orgasm bronzer is doable it's not
like the best bronzer bevatron for your
skin but it is doable you can use it and
it'll work my favorite blush this month
is the makeup revolution now it's
literally called now with an exclamation
point I use the lace 813 a stippling
brush to apply this stuff this is super
pigmented so you definitely want to use
stippling brush in a light hand when you
apply it if you're looking for a good
blush that makes you look just like
flushed and like you just walked outside
and it was cooled outside this is
exactly that I feel like I've been
looking for a shade like this for like
my entire life and I finally found it an
on makeup item has been this bracelet
this is basically like the watch
bracelet combo that I wear every single
day this bracelet is by celebrity
inspired cameras l'bri inspired me or
celebrity inspired celebrity and smart I
only wear jewelry that I don't have to
take off in the shower
I'd rather splurge and have good quality
sterling silver jewelry then have stuff
that I have to take off every night that
I've been wearing this every single day
in the shower and it hasn't changed
colors at all it's real sterling silver
and it's really nice quality besides the
obvious super cute design what I really
like about this is I have never been
able to find a bangle that actually fits
my wrist I'm super super small wrist and
the awesome thing about this is that it
unscrews so it actually comes with a
mini screwdriver thing that you can take
the bracelet on and off the way this is
shaped since it's oval it just fits
perfectly on my wrist you have small
wrist this will definitely fit you if
you don't have small wrist they actually
make like a bigger size on their site
I'll link both of them down below I also
have a 10% off coupon code for you guys
if you want to check it out they make
rose gold gold and silver ones I'm kind
of obsessed with these and I kind of
want a whole armful of them I have a few
lip products are the laga lip products
let's start where should we start I'm
gonna start with colour-pop cosmetics
lbv this is a matte lip pencil I'll
swatch it for you guys why not this is a
super pretty berry color it looks a lot
brighter on my hand than does on my lips
for some reason but when you use this
with their liner it is like a perfect
deep berry color I'll run this in one of
my haul videos and in my leopard roll
blog I'll link both of those
or near or down below the next are two
products that I'm wearing on my lips
right now this is the Rimmel exaggerate
liner in the shade epic this is supposed
to be like a dupe for Mac spice I love
this great quality easy to use I love
the shade of this I've been looking for
like a deep good nude combo for forever
this one I am freakin obsessed with this
is the Milani matte naked lipstick you
need to pause this video go to the
drugstore buy this right now out of all
the products I mentioned today this is
by far my favorite product of January
literally this is the perfect matte
formula the perfect shade everything
this one I've been wearing every single
day to work it looks a lot deeper with
this liner on it's a perfect like deep
new color but still appropriate for work
smells kind of like crayons and vanilla
that I can overlook it next tray this is
definitely a lighter nude this is the
makeup revolution the one I wear this in
one until leopard wrote blogs I'll link
it over here so you can see what it
looks like on but this is like the
perfect nude if you have fair skin
definitely lighter than the Milani one I
just mentioned it's more of like a Mac
now it's definitely darker than that
though this is all in my head I'll
swatch it there it is perfect nudie
color I have two favorite nail polishes
is month both from the Milani color
statement line I kind of totally forgot
that they sent like the entire
collection of this and it was just
sitting in my closet I love the formula
of these nail polishes I'm wearing a
different shade right now the first
shade is mobbing forward it is like the
lip combo on my lips but in nail polish
form this is like almost a grandma shade
but not quite there if you like it's
deep enough that it doesn't look like a
grandma shade but I really like this
mopping forward next one is gilded rocks
and this is like such a frickin pretty
gold pink glitter this is one of those
glitters that you do not need anything
underneath it it's super opaque I wore
this on top of the
nail polish and it looked freakin
awesome if you want to see what this
looks like on with the black nail polish
I do have a photo on Instagram overall
just really been liking this line of
nail polishes in general and it's what
I've been wearing my entire month and my
last favorite is definitely not a makeup
product or beauty product they are shoes
these are my brand new babies how do I
show these I guess we don't need to so
these are the lace-up tom bootie wedge
things I don't know how the heck they
made these things but it literally does
not feel like you're wearing like high
heels these are the most comfortable
wedges I've ever worn in my entire life
I've worn these to work I've worn these
going out on the weekend they're just
like a great multi-purpose kind of shoe
I usually don't like the style of Tom's
but I feel like they like totally
stepped up their game they have tons of
cute styles they had one with like
leather on the back they had like a dark
maroon one of these they just have tons
of cute shoes I'm kind of obsessed with
these and then of the most comfortable
shoes I've ever worn all right my only
reject of the month is this Physicians
Formula i shadow palette thing whatever
you want to call this they look
beautiful like they look so metallic
they look so pigmented and they're just
not a chalky the weirdest formula a
couple of them are okay but the silver
ones are just so chalky and patchy
looking this is just like a total bust
to me did one other shade of this Tanny
Goldy shades champagne there we go so I
haven't tried that one so I can't speak
for that but this is not worth your
money and just don't buy it
packaging is cute though so that was my
January raves and rejects if you guys
