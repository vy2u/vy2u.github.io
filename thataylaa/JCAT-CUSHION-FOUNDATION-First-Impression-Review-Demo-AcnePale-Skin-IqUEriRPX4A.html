sentences right now alright so today it
is foundation Friday and we're going to
be talking about the jcat cushion
compact foundation I asked you guys on
snapchat a few weeks ago
you voted between the covergirl
foundation and this foundation and I
already did the review on the covergirl
foundation if you missed that one so now
we are testing out this bad boy pletely
forgot to film the first half of this
video so it's actually a few hours later
when I'm filming this literally got four
hours of sleep last night and then drove
an hour and a half this morning Kristy
and I were doing hair until 4:00 in the
morning slightly sleep-deprived right
now I leave for New York tomorrow
morning my time so I'm doing five
billion things today slightly stressed
slightly all over the place but we're
filming this foundation Friday also if
the quality looks different / not as
good / the lighting is weird I'm on the
sony a 5100 today because i cannon
literally just broke this morning before
filming this I'm having the weirdest
love today so anyways let's talk about
the foundation so during 15 days of
foundation I did a review on the Jake
eye skin sealer foundation I wasn't a
huge fan of that one I'm gonna leave
that review down below if you missed it
but that was a liquid foundation they
recently came out with an actual compact
foundation which is awesome I love how
more American brands are trying to hop
on the cushion
train my favorite cushion foundation
I've tried is the Misha magic cushion
did a review on that too so leave that
down below JK you can get at Ulta I
don't believe I've seen the cushion
compact sold at all - yet jacob does
carry this on their website you get 14
grams now 13 grams of product in here
and just to give you a comparison in the
Mesha you get 14 grams of product so
just a tiny bit less in here at the
shade one zero one porcelain which is
the lighter shade so this product
retails for $17.99 and if I'm being
totally honest I think that that's
pretty high obviously you have more high
quality packaging than you do is just a
flip powder or a liquid foundation so
I'm assuming some of the cost is because
of the packaging but it just seems very
high but when you run out of the cushion
product you don't have to buy a whole
new compact you literally just get the
refill and the refill is only $12.99 it
comes in eight shades which if you think
of in terms of normal foundation that's
pretty crappy but because this is a
cushion product I feel like
it's actually pretty good not sure how
deep the darkest shade goes but you guys
will see I have the lightest shade so
you'll see how it goes on in a second
their claims are pretty limited on here
so I'm just gonna breeze through this it
says it's skin care plus makeup doesn't
really say what kind of skin care
benefits this has they say daily sun
exposure 45 plus protector I'm not sure
if they're trying to say SPF 45 I don't
see anything about that anywhere else on
the packaging
okay so there's actually more claims on
the box than online so I'm just going to
read this it says it's a multitasking
formula that delivers flawless coverage
sun protection and hydration in an
invisible flawless airbrush application
without streaks or unevenness of makeup
flawless natural coverage and that's
pretty much it so let's jump into the
first impression I feel like my brain is
a mashed potato right now if you want to
see my thoughts on this foundation and
how it applies Amar's throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching right so Sony camera does have
a little bit of a blurring effect to the
face I don't have that feature turned on
but it still blurs and makes your face
look better than it actually is so since
this is a foundation video just keep
that in mind it's literally my only
option today so we're doing it for the
most part any cushion foundation I've
ever used has applied better with the
actual sponge that it comes with that
tells me to apply for me it always works
better with the sponge it comes with but
for the sake of the video I will try a
brush on one side of my face in the
compact sponge let me other side rows of
packaging I really like this metallic
thing they have going on also really
like the inside of this totally black
love the all-black love the black sponge
I haven't seen this with the cushion
foundation before and like with normal
cushion products they have this little
sealant thing where you push it all the
way down if you don't push it all the
way down your product will dry out they
want to make sure you do that then you
just peel off and there we go the most
satisfying thing ever all right I'm
gonna zoom ian cuz I can I've primed my
face with is you a anti blemish matte
primer that I've been using everyday
let's go in with product so I'm gonna
use the sponge first on this side and
then go in with a brush maybe on the
side and I will see oh this is a firm
compact if you like
right off the bat I can tell the formula
of this is a little bit
I don't think stiffer is the right word
but it kind of feels like it just isn't
sliding around as much even just an
application shade is actually pretty
light and very pink toned wasn't
expecting that looking at the pan we'll
see if this oxidizes but so far off the
bat this looks like one of the lighter
cushion foundations I've seen you do
really have to push down in this cushion
to get product out it has a scent I'm
not sure what it is oh it's coming back
smells like something from childhood
know so far about this bunch I would say
it's slow medium coverage high light low
medium on that one layer I can still see
some redness and stuff coming through my
skin doesn't look totally flawless but I
kind of like that just for something
quick it evens out my skin tone but it's
not making a look totally full coverage
yet so this time I'm going to try brush
I'm just stippling it straight into that
compact I don't know if it's going to
take anything off and I'm using my Sigma
f80 by the way so yeah it's pretty much
picking up no product especially because
you have to really push down in this
compact if you want like ultra ultra
light coverage maybe a brush would be
good but I definitely think we're going
to switch back to the sponge so I
definitely feel like I don't need any
more product on my forehead my forehead
looks pretty flawless I am going to go
in just as a little bit more down here
to see if I can build that up and get a
little bit more coverage Wow
that looks good kind of impressed with
this one at this point the finish of
this is very beautiful super skin like I
don't really see any texture on my face
right now my pores don't look like
amazing you can see my pores right here
but they don't look ultra large since
they don't have as much to cover up on
this side I'm just going in with a tiny
bit more
so before I apply concealer and the rest
of my makeup and everything I will show
you guys a close-up right now this is
looking very nice beautiful finish kind
of just looks like your skin but better
oh it actually feels like it's starting
to set okay that's exciting because
every other cushion foundation ivy
used it has a very not wet but you
definitely need to set it or else like
your hair is just going to stick to it
it just feels kind of sticky usually
little bits coming off when I'm tapping
but it's not majorly transferring if I
don't have to set this I'm going to be
frickin thrilled if I'm going with my
under eye concealer and give that a few
minutes to set just so I can see if I'm
going to need a powder or not you can
really see with this concealer how pink
tone the foundation is feels like it
hasn't totally set like the forehead has
yet so it probably needs it good yeah
this feels great
five more minutes or so so I'm going to
go do the rest of my makeup right now is
twelve seventeen I'm getting a late
start today my life is a show right
now you're probably already told you all
about let's call the check-in time 12:15
I will be right back once I have the
rest of my face up okay so it's no 1242
I don't know why that took me a half
hour I learned I did nothing on my face
just did super basic makeup today
because I have a bunch of errands to run
you gotta say right now at this point in
time this looks pretty bomb if you don't
like doing products you won't like this
unless you set it with a matte powder
but if you do look at this glow right
now I love the way it looks on my
forehead it looks super natural but it's
set I didn't powder my face at all I
only used bronzer and it blended out
totally fine I used the pixi by petra
subtly suntouch love this bronzer and I
tried for the first time the Catrice Sun
glow in zero three zero medium bronze it
just like mix these two together for my
face highlight is the goddess of love
and then my lips are two-faced lip
injection the gloss in angel kisses I've
been wearing this a ton I love this and
it definitely burns like one of those
plumping things so right now I really
don't have any complaints I do have
combination skin and I tend to get oily
throughout the day on my t-zone but
there are certain foundations where I
can just tell when I put them on that I
don't need to set it with the powder and
there are others that it's the opposite
so this was just one that I don't really
feel like I need to set just the way
that it's setting on my face but I'm
hoping that we don't get super oily
throughout the day because right now it
looks beautiful so I'm going to go about
my day and I will check back in a few
hours I am going to do the next check-in
and natural lighting so you can see how
the foundation looks there all right so
it's now 333 so the Foundation's been on
for a little over three hours and had
out of the house right now for couple
hours so I wanted to check in a little
bit early and get some natural light so
you guys can see I think it looks pretty
dang good it looks very skin-like
but it still has coverage I feel like
it's one of those foundations where you
could get a lighter coverage if you
wanted or you can build it up like I did
and get more of a medium coverage but I
do think next time I could even get away
with one layer if I just spot concealed
a little bit shade wise this one is a
little bit too pink for me if they
haven't it's a little more beige or
neutral toned I'll probably be
purchasing that one I like this by the
end of the night the shade doesn't look
bad I just think it's a tiny bit off so
this camera is obviously a little bit
different than the one I usually film
with but you can still see up close if
you think I'm starting to get a little
bit oily around my nose around here
looks pretty good no major lip creasing
or anything my forehead looks it's
actually looking shinier on here than it
does in real life for some reason just
looks dewy no oil is coming off or
anything right now no major complaints
I'm going to go carry out my day and
I'll check back in at the end of the
night it's now 9:30 p.m. so the
Foundation's been on for a little over 9
hours and I literally feel like I'm
sleepwalking at this point I've been
packing for like the last three hours
and working and trying to get my life
together and trying to stay awake let's
look at the foundation by the way red
lipstick so I was just playing around
colors to bring to New York think you
guys can see on this camera how oily I
am
there's just pretty much oil all over my
face right now I was checking pretty
much every hour and I would say it
looked good up until about the 7 hour
point maybe 6 or 7 hour point it was
pretty good still but I do think that
obviously if you have oily skin you're
going to need to set this one at the
same time though the cushion foundations
are never super long-lasting on me my
Misha cushion doesn't get this oily I
feel like without a powder but it
definitely isn't like a long wearing
foundation and this product didn't claim
to be super long wearing but it is super
oily like next time if I'm going to be
wearing it for more than five hours I'll
probably powder my face with it it looks
really good when it first goes on I
think it looks pretty damn good for the
first two hours so if you're looking
just for something to throw on when
you're going to run errands or whatever
and you're just going to be back at home
and you don't care how your face looks
in a few hours I think it would be good
if you're trying to find
like a new favorite all day long word
foundation I don't think this is the one
for you dry skin you might really like
this though because it is very
moisturizing when it goes on I almost
think the way this one went on and since
it is pretty hydrating I think it might
work for mature skin so I don't think
this one was bad by any means I actually
think the finish of it and wait first
goes on is very beautiful
I think I'll still be using this I would
just use it too like I said go run
errands for a few hours I hope you guys
