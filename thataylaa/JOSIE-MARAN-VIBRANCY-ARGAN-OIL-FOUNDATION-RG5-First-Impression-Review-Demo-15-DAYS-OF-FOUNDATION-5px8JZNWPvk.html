of foundation where is time going I feel
like I'm going to say that in every
video from here to number 15 if you're
new here this is where we are trying out
a new foundation every single day for 15
days day 9 which means you guys are
probably sick of the intro by now but
it's here today if today's foundation is
one that was requested by you guys this
is the Josie Maran vibrancy argan oil
fluid foundation and this is pretty new
and I had to freaking hunt down my shade
this is the shade RG 5 which is the
lightest shade
they've been all sold out online and in
stores of the shade but I just set up
alerts on for calm and they send you an
email when something comes back in stock
let's read some of the claims on
sephora's website so on sephora's
website comes in 14 shades I've the
shade RG 5 which says for fair skin
tones with neutral undertones alright
let's see what they say
a revolutionary medium to full coverage
skin care foundation fluid powered by a
hundred percent pure argan oil and
nutrient pigments for vibrant glowing
skin and they quote like a
fresh-squeezed juice vibrancy utilizes a
revolutionary cold-pressed process that
preserves the powerful hand selected
ingredients for the freshest most
effective skin care foundation did read
some of the ingredients on the back of
the box and it looks like there are a
lot of things that grime coping don't
break me out coconut aloe leaf juice
which is actually supposed to be good
for acne I believe there's shea butter
if any of you guys are good at
dissecting ingredients please let me
know if this foundation would be good or
bad fracking obviously everyone's skin
is different to something that breaks me
out might be totally fine for you but
just keep that in mind so as far as
their color mashing it says R is for
rosy undertones G is for golden
undertones and RG is for neutral or rose
gold undertones so this is more of a
neutral shade which I agree with it
matches me really well it's pretty much
all of the claims on here supposed to be
medium to full coverage and if you guys
are new to my channel I have combination
skin with cystic acne I tend to get oily
throughout the day on my t-zone like
always the 15 days of foundation play
is linked down below if you missed any
of the things you can go wash them there
I also started adding little day numbers
to the thumbnails so when you go on my
channel you can see just by scrolling
what day is what if you guys want to see
how the Sun ation applies and where's
throughout the day you're in the right
place
just keep watching all right now to wake
yet it is 8:30 in the morning I'm back
at my aunt's house because construction
was still going on got the coffee so I'm
still in San Diego obviously yesterday I
didn't film I wore the Golden Rose stick
foundation again which I did a review on
for day 8 and if you missed that video
you'll want to go watch it or to get me
yesterday setting my full face of the
cover of X powder and I really liked it
but today we're talking about the josie
maran vibrancy argan oil fluid
foundation and the shade rg5 and can I
just say I went on a freakin witch hunt
to find this shade look at this
packaging I think it's beautiful looks
like watercolor swirly things has a
super pretty gold pump so this is just a
work of art not a foundation I don't
have all of my stuff with me so I
unfortunately can't do the half prime
side but I do have a brush and Real
Techniques blender so we are going to do
a half face of each so this is supposed
to be medium to full coverage I'm just
going to pump out some one two back in
my hand don't you know where my palette
is right now and first I'm going to go
in with the brush on this side of my
face let's do this so again I'm going to
have to be careful of the brows a little
bit this is supposed to be super glowy
has our mineral in it
it smells interesting I've never tried
that josie maran argan oil I have tried
to milk just like little sample packets
of it I can't remember what that smells
like with this smells definitely smells
like some kind of hair oil or something
whew super pretty glowy finish already
and good coverage the waist looking
right now I don't think I need to really
go over it for a second layer I really
like coverage and the shade
this is good too with stipple a little
bit of this on my forehead then I'm
going to have to be careful because I
just got the permanent brows on okay I'm
going to carve out the brows after I do
the side of my face so I did use pretty
much a full pump on the side of my face
but coverage wise and finish it looks
super nice and luminous I was oozes high
medium coverage that are definitely
still some spots showing through but I
don't mind it let's take of this video I
might put on a little bit more and see
if we can build it up and get totally
full coverage but I would be totally
fine going out like this on them on a
normal day putting one more pump on the
back of my hand and the consistency
running a little bit but it's not too
runny and it's not too fixed and so far
I don't feel like the golden rose
foundation broke me out as totally if
I'm wearing it two days in a row but it
is hard to tell when the after two days
and thank you guys who are very
concerned about my skin in the comments
with 15 years foundation but do try out
new products almost every single day
anyways
could be part of my skin issue but again
I do YouTube I rarely wear the same
foundation two days in a row anyways so
don't worry guys it's all thing okay
okay so I do think I had to use more
products with a sponge because I use
that full pump and we didn't even cover
my forehead yet so I so went on and
blend it out this one is a little bit
less tricky but I'm just going to pounce
over this side to see coverage wise they
look about the same I think you could go
with a better brush or sponge for this
one so before I do the brows I'm just
going to put a tiny tiny tiny bit over
some of spots on this side and see if I
can give fuller coverage see if it's
buildable and things I really like this
so far I think the shade is really nice
it definitely is a super glowy dewy
foundation so I'm going to have to set
my whole face for sure if you have dry
skin your skin would probably love this
because it's not
to any of the dry patches at all on my
forehead is actually sitting super nice
on my forehead okay so my full face is
covered I am really liking this so far
just first impressions I think it looks
super nice and luminous the shade is
definitely a match it's light enough
looks like a pretty neutral shade to me
it's not too pink or too yellow I was
kind of shocked the coverage we got
coverage and finish so far actually
kinda reminds me of the a cosmetics CC
lumination cream gives just the right
amount of coverage and makes your face
look super plump and moisturized so I'm
going to apply the rest of my makeup and
I will be right back so before I powder
here's a close-up so you guys can see
the finish super luminous as you can see
as I turn my head definitely not full
full coverage like Marc Jacobs
remarkable or anything but this is
totally enough coverage for me on a
daily basis right so it is now 903 am
the rest of my makeup is on and I am
really liking it so far
even with setting my whole face using
this stuff it still looks dewy and you
can kind of see the foundation coming
through I love when that happens so hey
when you have a duty foundation and then
the powder totally covers up all the do
this is beautiful sitting really nice on
the skin hoping I don't get super oily
just because it does have argan oil in
it but we shall see you this foundation
is probably going to be on for a long
time tonight because I'm actually flying
back to Seattle tonight I'm going to be
checking in throughout the day but it
might be in kind of dinky places because
I'm not going to have this camera so I
will check back throughout the day okay
so we were like at lunch and then
walking around all these random stores
in San Diego so I decided to film in the
kids section of this random French place
so this is what the foundation looks
like this was after six hours aware at
around 3 p.m. and I think it looks
pretty damn good
it looks glowy still but it doesn't look
oily to me I think it's sitting really
nice from the skin my mom liked it again
Wow - mom and baby do foundation
approvals that's a refuge let me tell
you and I just see I like it I know it
was on my lip here her chin whatever
that is I think it was lipstick so
anyways yep that's
the check in now I'll see you guys later
on in the night after my flight all
right we are back in our normal
background I just got home from the
airport literally 30 seconds ago
unzipped my suitcase took out my camera
and we're filming the final check-in so
it's now 9:00 2:18 p.m. so the
Foundation's been on for over 12 hours
now and wish probably in the mirror
I couldn't talk through the last
check-in because I was in a random
French store but I do really like how it
looked at the last check-in it looks
nice and glowy without looking super
oily or anything and for being a dewy
foundation I actually feel like this
looks pretty good after 12 hours
it looks glowy it definitely looks a bit
oily on my forehead but I don't feel
like I look like a greaseball right now
I still feel like I look kind of doing
Chloe and keep in mind that the lights
do reflect off so it does look a little
bit more shiny under the lights and it
does in real life starving right now
feels good to be home I love going back
to San Diego to visit but it just
reminds me every time how much I
love Seattle so as far as how the rest
of it looks it's creasing a tiny bit
around my nose but nothing that you
would notice just looking at me straight
on a chin area looks good
cheeks look good blush bronzer
highlighter still completely on um
overall I really like the shade I loved
that I didn't have to mix this I feel
like I can totally wear the shade it's
light enough but not too ghostly white
for me it didn't oxidize throughout the
day at all either which is always a plus
so I like this one at the end of 15 days
you guys will see my thoughts compared
to this and some of the other
foundations I've liked so far I'm going
to rank them all one to 15 at the end of
the series so I'm not going to spoil it
now but I do really like this foundation
and I'll definitely be wearing this one
again so if you guys liked this video
and you are excited about 50 knees
foundation give it a thumbs up don't
forget to tell your friends about 15
days of foundation and literally in like
a split formation right now on my floor
didn't even pull my chair oh and my
ankle feels like it's been a crack in
half right now basically since I wasn't
able to film yesterday in real time my
time every day from here on out I have
to film to be on schedule so I'm just
fingers crossed that I don't get about
or anything between now and the end of
15 days home stretch this is actually a
lot harder than I thought it was going
to be I think I'm going to do like a
little recap thing of like that
went on during this whole process
because it's just interesting like
nothing is as seamless as it looks I
have so much more respect for daily
vloggers I've always had respect for
daily vloggers but it's like whole new
level man whole new level
love you guys thanks for watching see
you tomorrow oh why did I think this was
a good idea
alright I'm literally stuck in these
right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
