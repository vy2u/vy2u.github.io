right so today is July raised in May Jax
I literally just said that 25,000 times
it is 8:00 in the morning right now
night after the Bachelorette finale
Jojo chose the wrong guy definitely
feeling like I need a little caffeine
can tell it's gonna be an interesting
filming day I didn't film a June rice
and rejects last month I can't remember
why
so I have a ton of products right
here in this box to show you guys likely
then be a super long video so go grab
your burrito get some wine whatever your
thing is I just want to start off this
video by saying welcome to all the new
Bay Rados if you're new here say hi down
below if this is your first raise and
rejects on my channel I don't take
monthly favorites videos lightly I don't
just last minute throw all these things
in basket these are actually things that
I have been thoroughly using these past
couple months that I think is worth you
guys's money I have a bunch of exciting
things coming up but one of them is that
I'm going to be in New York for
beautycon this year which I'm super
excited about me and mallory 1712 are
going to be staying together for a few
nights there and we are going to be
going to beautycon so not sure if we're
doing some kind of like meetup situation
yet but we are going to be at beautycon
New York October 1st so excited it's
gonna be a good time also one last thing
that we're going to jump into this I
have two giant giant giveaways coming
soon it was supposed to be for hitting
hundred fifty thousand but we're still
doing it so one of them is going to be
on Instagram and the other one is going
to be on YouTube not sure which video
I'm going to be throwing into so just
stay tuned on Instagram and on YouTube
there's going to be two giant giant get
boys let's get into the makeup so this
month was basically the month of
highlighters for me a lot of these are
ones that I've never heard anyone talk
about so I'm really excited to share
them with you guys I found three amazing
affordable highlighters that all of you
need in your life so the first one is
what I'm wearing right now this is
actually an eyeshadow I mentioned this
on snapchat and on Instagram this is the
essence zero one snowflake
this is actually an eye shadow as soon
as I swatch this in store my first
thought was that this could be a really
good highlighter just because the
formula of this
so soft not powdery at all it doesn't
have any kind of glitter in it it's just
this beautiful sheen when you put it on
your face I know why i'm swatching
because it's literally on my face right
now there is no glitter this looks
almost identical to Becca pearl except
that it's $2 or $1 I need to figure that
out obviously if you don't have pale
skin this white shade will probably be
too light for you but if you do have
pale skin stunning I like pure white
highlighters on my skin gold highlighter
champagne pot those kinds of shades
don't look that great on my skin I
really like a white white light
highlighter pick this up at Ulta or Fred
Meyer whatever you have you will not
regret this if you don't like it as a
highlighter use it as an inner corner
shade I have the shade 0-8 apricot eye
here to show you guys as well this one
is also beautiful but on my skin I do
like snow flake a little bit better this
one is more of a champagne kind of color
but the formula again is just like they
need to repackage these and turn it into
a highlighter because these are amazing
most underrated highlighter on YouTube
that I've been talking about for years
is a Physicians Formula shimmer brick
except this is in a new shade to me for
years I've been using the warm new
palette this is natural nude and this
one is fifty thousand times more
stunning I didn't think it could get
more beautiful pretty much any skin tone
could use this depending on what yours
is you would obviously just go in with
lighter or darker shades for me I like
to use a mix of these ones up here it is
so beautiful it looks almost identical
to snowflake it just has a tiny bit more
like pink tones in it this is just so
underrated you can use this as a shadow
go pick up the shade natural nude last
highlight I've been obsessed with this
month is the etude house secret beam
highlighter I randomly found this on
Amazon when I was looking for the golden
rose stick foundation I think this is
like eight bucks nine bucks
stunning the shade of this reminds me a
lot of the Physicians Formula one it's
more unlike the pinky almost purpley
side which looks beautiful with the
blush I'm going to show you next when
you swatch this the formula of it feels
a little bit stiff not chalky just a
little bit stiff it's watching this does
not even do a justice because when you
apply this to your face no words the
brush I've been using to
my Harley is the Sigma fo3 I picked this
back up because my morphe 509 brush
though it is called totally frayed
edging to wash it again and light
condition it and get it back into shape
but I've just been too lazy to do that
so I've been using this brush and it is
beautiful there's something about the
quality of Sigma brushes i 100% think
Sigma brushes are worth it I've had my
Sigma f80 2 and F 80 brushes for almost
5 years they have not broke they have
not shed they're just amazing quality
some of you have to keep in mind with
morphe is that they're good short-term
affordable brushes they are not
long-term glues not the highest quality
it can be tricky if you're on a budget
and just want to grab something cheap
right off the bat but honestly Sigma
brushes are worth the investment to me
so just keep that in mind when you're
purchasing brushes these are expensive
they are an investment but they last so
the blush I've been wearing every single
day I think there's been like two days
where I've applied to different blush
this month is wet and wild color icon
blush in in a purple haze I think this
might be limited edition I'm not sure
but I'm pretty sure you can still find
this on Amazon this is a couple bucks
when Wilde reformulated their color icon
blushes and these formulas are so much
nicer
these blend out beautifully I'm wearing
it right now it has a little bit of the
glow to it I wouldn't say it's like a
shimmery blush or anything but it does
have a little bit of a glow if I
seriously already been talking for 20
minutes so liquid lipsticks that I have
fallen in love with this month are the B
heel liquid lipsticks these are amazing
I have about six shades of them I wore a
few different shades of these during 15
days of foundation if you ever want to
know if I have a video mentioning a
product or wearing a certain products
you can literally just type into YouTube
the Tayla and then the name of the
product
I type everything in the description box
so that video should pop up for you two
of my favorite shades are natural nude
which I'm wearing right now and pretty
penny which is this beautiful Orange II
red without too much orange in it this
brand is brand new so if you haven't
heard of them before that is why I think
they're only a few months old honestly
one of the best liquid lipstick formulas
I have come across so far they have a
normal
the applicator they're not drying on the
lips but they do dry completely matte
long-lasting the scent of these reminds
me of like a pumpkin spice latte it's
like vanilla mixed with the pumpkin
spice latte but I've been loving these
I've been reaching for these over my
Stila I believe you can only get these
on their website right now so I'm going
to link them down below along with
everything else I'm mentioning today
obviously like always
so foundation favor of the month you
probably all can guess if you watch 15
days of foundation if not I'm gonna
leave that playlist down below you can
go watch all the videos I did announce
in the wrap-up video that I'm going to
be continuing 15 days of foundation
we're also starting foundation Friday
this week this Friday 6 p.m. Pacific
time the very first foundation Friday
video will be up which I'm super excited
about but anyways favorite foundation
hands-down Tarte rainforest so the sea
not going to go in-depth about this
because I literally did a full review on
it only con for me is that I do have to
apply quite a bit of this and layer it
to get the kind of coverage I like but
if you mix in a couple drops of the
cover FX custom cover drops these are
awesome for mixing them with foundation
I literally use about 1/3 of the product
when I use these two together however I
am 99% sure that these break me out
that's kind of a bummer so instead
lately I've been mixing this with the
Marc Jacobson horrible foundation which
is what's on my face right now
I literally just drop in a couple drops
of Marc Jacobs gets really good coverage
the formulas of them together just work
really well new powder discovery this
month has been the maybelline superstay
better skin in the shade 10 this
actually has salicylic acid in it which
I love my skin loves salicylic acid the
shade 10 is on the darker side so if
your my skin tone are a little bit
lighter it'll probably be too dark I use
it to actually warm up my face if I have
a foundation combo or a foundation that
looks a little bit too pale the formula
of this you're just so soft doesn't look
powdery on your face which is what I
like about it literally just kind of
melt into your skin this is definitely
more of a matte finish drugstore like in
this so eyeshadows that I'm wearing
right now I've shown on snapchat a bunch
this month I've worn a bunch in my 15
news foundation videos and
the vibrating sponge video which a ton
of you guys were asking what eye shadows
I was wearing in that video all of them
were makeup geek eyeshadows I've had
this palette for probably six months or
a year now and I never really reach for
it until this month I don't know what
inspired me to actually start playing
around with these but I am so glad I did
because I feel like I've been missing
out in life so makeup geek shadows if
you're not familiar with them are pretty
affordable you just buy the little
single pans here and you can stick them
in a Z palette or any kind of magnetic
palette that you have matte ones blend
out beautifully but some of them are
almost too powdery where you blend and
it kind of disappears a little bit but I
do really like Peach Smoothie which is
like cult favorite blending shade right
here I'm just going to tell you what's
on my eyes right now because that's
pretty much the ones I've been reaching
for most often so I have Peach Smoothie
and the peat in the peach in the crease
as a transition color then I went in
with this shade right here which is
stunning so my favorite shadows from
them are definitely their foiled
eyeshadows they have such a unique
formula they're super shimmery
reflective foiled shadows but they don't
have any kind of follow at all because
they're almost like and you know how to
describe it feels almost like a gel
formula to me this is a shade
starry-eyed this is what's all over my
lids right now in the center of my lid
and on the inner corner is the shade
whimsical which is this light pink
foiled eyeshadow it almost looks okay
we're getting some major creasing going
on in glot liner love the way it goes on
but damnit creases every single time so
this shade whimsical looks like it's
going to be super pinky purple when you
actually put it on your eye it's just
beautiful like light shimmery almost
white pink shade I just put this right
on the center of my lid to get some
dimension and I also have it on my inner
corner today another favorite of mine is
in the spotlight which is also a foiled
eyeshadow look at that reflective
reflection reflection reflectiveness
this one is more of a peachy shade these
are just gorgeous you don't need to wet
your brush at all when you use these and
then another favorite which I
think is foiled no this is just when
their eyeshadows this is in the shade
voltage this is amazing for the inner
corner if you want that super bright pop
in your inner corner it almost has a
little bit of like yellow or light gold
ish green in it but it's still light
enough to put on the inner corner
definitely recommend those foiled
eyeshadows for makeup key I'm pretty
sure my thing says 30 minutes right now
this is gonna be funded super quick
mention matte shadows been using the elf
mad format palette ever since filming
the elf one brand tutorial I've been
reaching for this a lot I'll usually use
the matte shadows from here going with a
couple the shimmery makeup geek shadows
and then I'm set for the price you
cannot beat this some of them are a
little bit stiffer than others but
overall like look at that pigmentation
alright so we have a couple more rays
that I'm going to go into rejects to
skincare favorites this month this is
the polished choice BHA liquid lotion
mention this in my nighttime routine if
you want to see my current skincare
routine along with what I do at night
you can go watch my nighttime routine
video you guys recommended this in my
last skincare routine video like months
ago if you have issues with texture try
out VHA if use this in the morning under
your foundation the glow enos just comes
through it looks beautiful under
foundation I know that's not as purpose
but this is honestly better than some of
my like illuminating primers second
skincare item that I had to mention if
you follow me on snapchat hear me talk
about this or wear this 5000 times at
this point but this is the new L'Oreal
pierre clay mask they don't actually
have the name of this one but I believe
it's like the detoxifying one L'Oreal
came out with three new mass this one is
by far my favorite there's something
about it that my skin just really likes
I am almost like halfway done with it
right now the formula of this reminds me
exactly of the origins black charcoal
mask very almost gel like formula when
you put on your face but it completely
dries down and I just leave it on for
probably like an hour an hour and a half
and then I wash off my face and my face
just feels super smooth on to the fun
part rejects so I didn't want to put in
any
any of the foundation rejects this month
because there was quite a few and I
mentioned all those in the best and
worst of 15 days foundation video so I'm
not including any of those products here
because you already know how I feel
about them I did have one foundation
reject to mention though not part of
that series because I didn't do a June
raison rejects video I couldn't mention
this one but this is the l'oreal
infallible pro glow foundation now i
know a lot of people love this
foundation for me personally this one
really didn't work i'm not sure if I
just got a dud I almost want to pick up
another because it just feels so oily to
me like when I put it on my face it
doesn't feel like a dewy foundation it
feels like a liquid gracie formula i
just can't get this to work on my skin i
tried mixing it in with other stuff and
it just goes to show that every product
works really differently for different
people i will say some people are
calling this full coverage this is not
full coverage next reject is the
anastasia beverly hills liquid lipstick
in the shade mic now i have never
purchased anastasia a liquid lipstick
until literally a month ago i don't know
they've just never really been that
attractive to me i purchased the shade
milkshake and stripped at sephora i need
to see if it was worth all the hype ooh
and it is so not in my opinion these
remind me of a worse version of the
colour-pop ultra matte lips they are
super drying they crack you can't apply
over them
this shade milkshake in particular is
extremely patchy definitely going to be
returning this shade because it's just
too patchy to wear get an even
application you have to use a couple
layers of this next reject is this
L'Oreal True Match Lumi Pro glow
illuminator I had high hopes for this
because I usually have good luck with
the like color correcting kind of
highlighters when you mix colors
together like this the shade usually
comes out really beautifully this
formula is just so shitty great thing is
i swatches pretty nice like it looks
like it's going to be okay
when you swatch it but as soon as you
put this on your face it literally just
all disappears I have no idea what
happens to it it's a little bit on the
powdery chalky side just kind of
disappears off your face and not a fan
my last reject this is the freedom pro
studio strobe cream I think I use this
in a shadow introduced video so I'll
link it down below if I did it just
really doesn't do anything more of like
a really highly scented moisturizer I
don't see the glow I don't see any
strobing effects going on it's pretty
much just like a lightweight moisturizer
what is this scent it smells like it
almost smells like a Biffy to me like
you know that scent not like a
scent but just like a port-o-potty scent
it has that weird scent all right that
was all of my race and rejects I hope
you guys liked this video
it was probably extremely long if you
liked this and it was helpful for you
give it a thumbs up I always love when
you guys tweet me we're talking about
Instagram things that you have purchased
off of my recommendations so if y'all
follow me on Twitter Instagram is all
the Tayla snapchat is the tale of snaps
who's excited for a foundation Friday
