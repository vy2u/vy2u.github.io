shitty
all right so today we're doing July rays
and rejects this month
what's a busy month I was gone for like
half of it moved apartments I've been
documenting a moving process in moving
vlogs so I have three of them up now I'm
going to be having a force coming to
actually the fourth might be up at time
you guys are showing this video but when
I'm filming this I'm pretty much all
moved in so I'm going to be having a
whole apartment tour coming Beauty room
tour come in all the good stuff so this
month I don't have a whole lot of things
I liked I have a lot of things I don't
like I don't like just thrown in stuff
to throw it in but I don't have a lot of
products I don't have a whole lot of
products let's get into them I'm going
to leave my raids and reject playlist
down below so you can see last month's
videos and all the other month's ever I
found a solution to the door handle
showing grace mature genius this one is
definitely like the standout makeup item
of the month for me this is the Kevin
and Quan celestial bronzing veil in
tropical nights it's like this ombre
kind of thing this lightest shade right
here is perfection for contour if you
have fair skin holy-shit sees this is
amazing there was on vacation and I was
self-tanning and stuff this month this
was perfect because I could just bring
this and depending on what my skin tone
was I could go in with any of these
shades deeper a brown shade right here
is a nice bronzer where it's not to
oranjee not to warm it still looks like
a nice deep kind of brown formula this
is beautiful it's pigmented but not
overly pigmented it blends out easily it
does have a little bit of a sheen to it
I don't want to say it's like shimmery
but it definitely has a little bit of a
sheen to it you can see it in the pan
even but I picked this up just kind of
on a whim in Sephora when I was in New
York and this to me is worth every penny
I freaking love this thing this thing is
like my new go-to dry shampoo this is
the igk jetlag invisible dry shampoo
they need to make a candle and a perfume
and everything else out of this oh my
god it smells so friggin good I
literally could just sit here and sniff
this for an hour I'm wearing this in my
hair right now it doesn't give that
white cast I'll do a list a little spray
you can use as like a texturizing spray
as well it gives me volume like look at
that my hair is so thick and heavy that
it doesn't hold at ease so this just
helps to give me some texture and volume
you can also use it on like the ends of
your hair or just commish my hair for
some texture in there this I really like
using on like 2nd 3rd 4th day hair if
it's
been a week and I'm on day number five
I'll use something that takes away the
oil a little bit more than this one this
one I just really like for like styling
and it does help with the oil this is
awesome I think azide chic and Sephora
now I think it is they have the best
packaging to all their products are just
beautiful to the face awash I've been
using the last three months pretty much
every single day at night has been the
elbe acne dough maximum strength face
and body scrub I got this because I was
in the depths of Amazon looking up acne
products so what's new and I came across
this face wash that's had really good
reviews it has 2% salicylic acid in my
skin that responds a lot better to cell
silk acid than benzoyl peroxide and it
says that has willow bark extract no
parabens or synthetic fragrances or
anything like that I feel like I noticed
a difference in my skin when I stopped
using this I was gone for a couple weeks
I didn't have this face wash with me I
definitely notice my skin breaking out
more and when I started using it when I
got back home it got kind of like under
control again I'm not sure my shadow and
shmooze is going to be going up before
this but I was going to talk about
accutane in that video feel like I've
been talking about this for last few
months but actually I'm going to start
accutane in September so I'm going to be
documenting the whole process and
everything I don't really want to get
into arena I just made that executive
decision I'll tell you guys more about
accutane and the timing and everything
in the shadow inch mousse but anyways in
the meantime I'm using this face wash
this next product is one of those cult
favourite items that I've just never
wanted to try out I don't know why but I
picked this up when I was in New York
because I ran out of my Physicians
Formula
eye booster and we were in Sephora so I
wanted to give this a go have fun to you
tattoo liner in trooper block waterproof
liquid eyeliner and since that trip I
don't want to say I like this one more
than my Physicians Formula at this point
I think they're pretty much equal but
since then I've been reaching for this
liner it stays on my eyes it's super
easy to get a fine point with your wing
I think I tried this out as like a
Sephora sample I want to say like a year
ago and I was not impressed by it and I
think I used it that one time or a
couple times and just kind of stopped
using it I don't know if that one was
just like dried out or what but this one
I've been really liking this guy was a
pleasant surprise did a video testing
out Amazon makeup brushes and since that
video I've been reaching for this brush
for blush it's the perfect shape it's
super soft it just blends it out easily
and I can get it right where I want it
the Emacs design brush it comes in a
brush set boiler overall I like the wood
brush set better than the other one I
compared it to as far as I know you
can't buy this brush individually but
there are a few other really nice
brushes in that set kabuki brushes
powder brushes and it's super affordable
I've just been still using this one for
blush and I really like it this powder
kind of pleasantly surprised me since I
have been so many different skin tones
as month with tanning I use this powder
and brought this with me on my trips
because I have a bunch of different
shades of these it was just kind of
convenient but I ended up actually
really enjoying this powder I've been
just reaching for it to reach for it not
because it's convenient wow that just
sold it but this is a new Maybelline fit
me loose finishing powder the thing I
like about this is that it has some
pigment to it it gives you a little bit
of color it gives you a little bit of
coverage you guys don't have a weird
thing with loose powder as a lot of
times even if they have pigment to them
they'll take away the coverage of my
foundation and that doesn't happen at
all with this my favorite way to apply
this is actually with my dry morphe
sponge i just use the bottom of it have
this on my face right now in the shade 5
i just dip the bottom of the sponge in
here and then like cover my face in it
basically it says beautifully on the
skin it's matte but it gives you that
kind of soft focus and that kind of
finish this powder to me is really hard
to look cakey last rate for the month is
another hair product this is the Shea
Moisture argan oil and almond milk
smooth and tame blowout cream this
smells so amazing
it's literally heavenly it's like sweet
and almost smells like vanilla a little
bit but then there's some almond in
there
it has marshmallow root extract in it it
says it's pretty much for all hair types
cruelty free color safe no sulfates
parabens mineral oils I put this all
over my hair when it's damp when I get
out of the shower and I feel like it
really helps to kind of tame some like
the flyaways and just keep my hair
feeling soft and smooth these are all
extensions but I noticed my real hair
when I use this feels much more soft and
when I don't in the Dead hair now after
attempting go silver it's actually only
right here like the next time I get my
hair cut it'll be totally off my real
hair is a lot healthier now it's pretty
much all grown out it doesn't look that
healthy right now cuz I'm on like day 5
hair if you have super dry damaged hair
Shea Moisture has some really great
products I really like their hair mask
as well and get this at all - it's super
affordable alright so it is reject time
I have
whole bin here filled with rejects so in
a recent video I kind of touched on my
thoughts on this and there was kind of
like a mixed response it seems like half
of you guys really enjoy this product
and half of you guys really don't enjoy
this product and it's interesting
because let me tell you what it is first
this is the l'oreal voluminous Lashkar
dice
waterproof mascara so basically this got
a lot of hype for being a Too Faced
better than sex dupe and I will say the
packaging is extremely similar I see how
they were going for a dupe kind of
effect the wand looks similar to me this
is nothing like the Too Faced better
than sex mascara I don't get nearly the
same kind of volume that I get without
mascara and this is much more of a drier
formula it's interesting because it
seems like the people that liked this
mascara are the ones who don't like to
face better than sex
which makes sense because they're
totally different I totally see that
because this one is less clumpy doesn't
give you the same kind of volume it's a
different formula it makes sense why if
you like one you wouldn't like the other
but to me that's not a dupe at all it's
literally just the same packaging this
one didn't work out for me more power to
you if it worked out for you mascara is
one of those things that just so hard a
lot of times to recommend a mascara
because people just seem to have totally
different views on mascaras the past
month I've been picking up some random
brushes just to try out different brands
and see if I like any of them so pick up
two different cap on D brushes this one
is a reject for me this is number 25 I
guess I just had a higher expectations
for this because the reviews on Sephora
we're saying this is like a
multi-purpose brush that you can use for
everything you can use it for your under
eye setting powder contour bronzer blush
and when I got this in the mail I
literally went back and read the reviews
to make sure we were talking about the
same brush here I still did try it out
for all of those things pretty much
anything I could try it out for I did
besides liquid foundation and I don't
get it like to me could just be my face
shape but for me this brush is just a
little bit too small and firm to do any
of those things I couldn't find one use
for this that I actually enjoyed it with
this is my first Kat Von D brush
purchase ever I don't have any of her
other brushes I like the brush handle I
think it's really pretty
it is soft the bristles feel nice it
feels like good quality but I just kind
of totally underwhelmed with this thing
and now I don't know what to do with it
L'Oreal micellar cleansing water don't
like this at all
this is like pure oil if
feels like an oil makeup remover use
this all over my face I used it to take
off my eye makeup and it did take off
the eye makeup but it just leaves this
oily film all over your eyes not like a
typical micellar water micellar waters
are usually very lightweight feeling
they literally feel like a water but
they take off your makeup typically they
don't leave you with any kind of film
that actually feels really nice it's
been really liking the Garnier one but
this I'm just going to use to like take
swatches off my arm and stuff just to
not waste it and use it up but I would
not use this on my face really don't
like the film that it leaves at all this
eyeliner is a total fail for me this is
the NYX Trey Jolie tres Jolie gel pencil
liner in brown definitely use this in a
past video before I think a shadow and
she was like awhile ago and this just
doesn't freaking come out it's horrible
on the waterline even not on the
waterline like just trying to put it on
your lower lash line there's not a whole
lot of color payoff to it just kind of
like a shitty brown liner next reject I
feel like was actually one of the most
hyped up drugstore products this month
this is the Maybelline master chrome
metallic highlighter in 100 I've heard
complete rave reviews of this
highlighter I understand I'm not someone
who likes that glitter boom i shadow
look kind of highlighter which probably
why I don't like this but I have texture
on my face and this is one of those
highlighters for me that just emphasizes
it times a thousand
looks pretty shitty I didn't get that
intense intense metallic effect either
you guys saw me try this out in the
shadow and schmooze I've tried it since
then I'm not wowed by it at all I think
it looks like time to cyst shading eye
shadow feels like it's going to be
really nice when you swatch it like a
super soft and buttery feeling but when
it's actually on the skin I don't know
it just looks like a really mediocre eye
shadow to me so it's a covergirl total
tease mascara you guys also saw me try
this out in the drugstore first
impressions video and this one is just
like one of those products where I feel
like brands try to be really original
which is great and sometimes it works
out in their favor but this one is just
like what is happening so as you can see
this has the weird little tip right here
where you can use it to like separate
your lashes apparently or get the lower
lash line it just didn't work well for
either of those things and it gives you
like a really really really natural lash
almost to the point where it's like not
worth wearing mascara
it was pretty underwhelmed by this but I
like the packaging so this is another
product that I picked out
at this for when I was in New York and
it looked totally different in this for
lighting so this is the Seurat we love
as a dis or this is a blush this thing
was not cheap I think this is around
like 30 bucks this is a newer brand
kradin Sephora so I wanted to give it a
go it looks like a really nice cool
toned brown shade that I was going to
use as like a contour that was the plan
when I stepped outside this floor and
got back to the hotel it didn't look
quite the same it definitely has more of
like a rose warm tone to it the shade is
fine the blush is fine but for the price
point I was just kind of shocked by this
packaging when I took it out of the box
this is like kind of ridiculous for the
price point you get a little plastic
thing holds in the actual blush I don't
know if they were going for like the
minimalistic sleek look here but even if
the actual packaging this plastic is so
friggin cheap I feel like if you drop
this it would just crack it just reminds
me of like kids makeup or something
there's something about the packaging
that's like a huge turnoff to me
probably be returning this for that
reason because the actual shade I'm not
that wowed by the actual formula is fine
but I'm not completely wowed by and the
packaging is just know then my last
reject for the month yeah dang I did
shit-ton rejects guy saw recently in my
Ulta one brand tutorial this is the
older double duty primer and foundation
you like the one word I have to describe
this it's definitely double duty double
shitty supposed to be medium to full
coverage combined silicone and soft
focused complex there is nothing about
this foundation that a soft focus this
looks so heavy so cakey looks like you
have like five layers of foundation and
five layers of powder on like I always
say foundations work differently for
different people so I'm sure some of you
love this for my skin this one just
really didn't work out alright that's
everything
by the way on my face right now I'm
wearing the pure trendsetter lashes my
eyeshadows are all the Jacqueline Hill
morphe palette and my lips are Oprah
I'll have it down below in the
description box it's in my car right now
