Buffalo Wild Wings if you're attempting
to eat healthy do not watch my own
videos that is what inspires this
Buffalo Wild Wings purchase
all right so today it is june raves and
rejects i feel like you guys are going
to be able to guess like 90% of the
products i'm going to mention today
because the last reason rejects video I
did was April so these are really my
favorites from like the past two months
pretty much yeah pretty sure I mentioned
all these products at some point but
that's kind of the point of favorites
right there are things you actually use
my entire face and makeup right now I
used all these products you can see how
they actually look on well let's jump
into it everything I'm going to be
talking about is linked down below in
the description box I also have a lot of
rejects this month pre warning so I'm
gonna start out with dis concealer
because I am so frickin excited about
this I think I'm actually gonna do a
whole video on this product and show you
swatches and everything because they
just came out with two lighter shades
and a white shade of this this is the BH
Studio Pro total coverage concealer this
thing is six bucks six or seven bucks
get off of BH Cosmetics five the shade
101 this is their previous lighter shade
and the shade works really well for me
it does have a bit of a yellow tone to
it and I usually like more pink toned
concealers I've been using it pretty
much every single day I've been reaching
for this over the Tarte shaped Cape the
thing I love about this is that it is
complete full coverage it's creamy but
then it dries down almost to like a
Tarte shape tape kind of thing where it
sets I would say it's a bit thicker and
creamier than the Urban Decay Naked skin
but not nearly as drying as a tart shape
tape I hope that this starts to get more
recognition on YouTube because this is
an awesome super affordable concealer
how to mention this one because I
officially finished drop this thing
it is now totally gone this is a
maybelline instant age rewind dark
circle eraser this is in the shade fair
the thing I love about this is that it
matches my skin tone exactly so on days
when I don't want to wear makeup
I'll just literally spot conceal with
this thing it blends into your skin
looks like there's no products sitting
on top of your skins you can't actually
see the concealer but it covers my acne
it looks beautiful if you want a
concealer for no makeup makeup kind of
days go with this one so these past two
months for kind of the month of bronzers
for me I just want to preface this by
saying I'm very picky with bronzers I am
equally as shocked that I have four here
that I want to talk about I really only
have three I'll explain I'm going to put
swatches in so you guys can see what you
think you'll like best because the tones
are a bit different in all these I like
a bronzer that has a tiny bit of red in
it but that's a little more cool toned I
don't like super warm orange II kind of
bronzers because they tend to pull
orange on my skin I think overall the
best one for my skin tone
formula wise and shade is definitely the
hourglass diffuse bronze light this is
they're fairly new shape now I think
this came out a few months ago barely
looks like a bronzer in the pan because
it's mostly like this cream color but
when you swirl them together you get the
most beautiful shade it's not too warm
definitely the most cool toned out of
all the ones I'm going to mention I love
the formula because they blend out
beautifully they give you this almost
Sheen it's not a totally matte bronzer
actually none of these are completely
matte but if you have a similar skin to
undermine you've been struggling to find
a bronzer that works for you I
definitely recommend this guy this next
one is the bare minerals invisible
bronze and fair to light is when I
wasn't initially wowed by the key for me
with this one is using a really light
hand I wouldn't say it's overly
pigmented but if you have more fair skin
it can easily look a bit orange II at
least on me but this is what I'm wearing
right now along with the Physicians
Formula contour it gives you a bit of a
warm kind of bronze but it's not
overpowering not to oranjee and the
formula this is just beautiful blends
out really easily all three I'm talking
about you formula the new Becca sunlit
bronzers are beautiful out of the three
this one has the most sheen to it but
the two shades and when you're talking
about our Capri Coast which is the
lightest shade and bronzed Bondi here's
them side-by-side looking at bronzed
Bondi in the pan I initially thought it
was going to be too kind of warm and
bronzy for me but the thing I like about
this is that it gives me that kind of
reddish bronze which if I am going to go
with a darker bronzer I want the red
tone to it the pretty close to me is
similar to the bareMinerals bronzer in
the sunset I have to use a really light
hand with it or it can look too warm but
if you use a light hand to really
beautiful shade by the way my favorite
brush to apply all of these has been the
Sigma duo fibre f15 brush this is great
for bronzer gives you a really easy
blended kind of look and doesn't apply
too much product in one place if you've
watched any foundation Friday's lately
you'll definitely know the next three
products coming so I'm just going to
quickly touch on them this bunch has
quickly replaced my Real Techniques
sponge I still love it but this thing is
freaking awesome this is my morphe I've
tried a couple of their other red
sponges that look like this and they're
not the same so I'm only recommending
this one I didn't like the flat edge one
it's not nearly as squishy this one is
damp right now so I just used it super
squishy super soft I love using this
bottom part I'll use the side sometimes
for concealer I used it today with the
BH Cosmetics concealer I actually also
use the RCM a powder today which I never
used but
want to whip it out and try it again you
decide to apply my powder as well and it
worked great by the way I feel like I
could talk all about this in a shouter
instruments or something but I just want
to quickly touch on something I'm a
morphe affiliate which means I give you
guys 10% off and I also make Commission
on it you can make Commission on any
product that you talk about whether it's
Sigma or whether it's BH Cosmetics
Maybelline you can make Commission off
of anything
making Commission off of morphe for
recommending a product that you
genuinely like is no different than
making Commission off of the Sigma brush
you actually make more Commission off of
Sigma higher end brands because those
are priced higher so with that being
said let's just chill in the whole
morphe Sigma I don't get it I could talk
all about this for five hours just
speaking for myself here but if I
recommend something is because I
genuinely love it there's a morphe
product in my rejects so one two three
yeah three products that were sent to me
in PR and my rejects that's that I could
talk all about this actually let me know
if you guys would want to do that in a
shadow inch moods because I have lots of
thoughts on this topic clearly but
anyways I even finished talking about
the sponge I think so the one thing I
will say with this sponge is that this
point is so pointless I just think they
could have made this either more firm on
the tip or just taken off the tip
because it really can't do a whole lot
with it kind of too flimsy to get right
in the corner so I have a couple
foundations I want to mention since I
haven't talked about my favorite
foundations in a couple months so coming
out of 15 days of foundation which if
you missed that series I'll link the
playlist down below I also do the best
and worst of that series my most reach
for foundation since then from that
series is definitely the laura geller
cover locks our nation I think I'm
almost add this I'm like getting to the
bottom this is such a beautiful
foundation the thing I love about this
is that it's full coverage its creamy
this is probably one of the more creamy
foundations I've ever used and really
liked it gives you that kind of plump
moisturize healthy look without being
overly dewy and mix is amazing with
pretty much any foundation I've tried it
with the only downside to me with this
is that it doesn't hold up super well on
my skin I have combination oily skin so
a lot of foundations break down on me by
the end of the night this one is not the
most long-lasting on me but if I just
want my skin to look frickin flawless
and smooth to type my texture really
well it's beautiful I definitely have to
powder my face with this one if I want
it to stay on but today I mix this with
my next favorite which is the covergirl
healthy elixir vitalist foundation so I
officiated 705 and
7:10 which are the exact frickin same
thing tweeted CoverGirl's says pissed we
did not get a response I think it's
ridiculous that the lightest shade is
this dark and that they actually have a
705 shade but it's the pretty much exact
same color at 7:10
but shade aside since I can't wear it by
itself because of the shade I've been
mixing it in with foundations and I love
it this thing stays on which is what
surprised me about it I have a whole
foundation Friday video on this but the
thing I love about this is that it
looked healthy it's dewy gives you that
glow but it stays on this is stayed on
throughout workouts it looks really
great by the end of the night I wish I
could just wear this by itself I'm
tempted to self tan just so I can wear
the foundation this on its own is
beautiful you can get really great
coverage mixed in with this it's like
next-level I also really love mixing
this in with the Lancome 10 adult ultra
makeup this is in the shade 90 and I was
a sasquatch at the end of May it was
like 90 degrees and we were sweating
we're outside the entire day I mixed
these two together and for me with oily
skin in the heat my makeup looked pretty
good all day so this one I'll mix in if
I want it to be like extra long-lasting
I don't like this foundation on its own
for me it looks a little bit too heavy
cakey so I just realized I talked about
the sponge and then forgot to talk about
the other two products super quick
because I mentioned this in every
foundation video favorite primer lately
has been the hilum eyed matte 12 primer
this helps my oil I really like these
two together because I have tried this
primer with other moisturizers I
fingered on Instagram comment or
something from one of you saying you
tried this and it kind of balled up on
your face try it out with different
moisturizers because this is one of
those products that really works
differently with different moisturizers
and how you're prepping your skin it
literally just almost fell over trying
to turn the camera back on because my
leg totally builds Lee so this is the
Urban Decay rehab makeup prep hot
springs hydrating gels I love this it
doesn't make my ask me any worse it has
a very thin kind of gel formula and
dries down and absorbs really fast which
is what I love about it these two
together for me have just been working
great to prep my skin's a standout
eyeshadow palette to me has been the BH
Cosmetics Carli bybel palette I feel
like this is not getting enough
recognition on youtubeland
or is it just me Carli de les palette
there was an original one which I never
picked up but I bought this one and it
has kind of exceeded my expectations all
of my eyeshadows right now are from this
palette and I also used this highlight
shade which is just beautiful I use this
in the shadow and smooth so if you want
to see it an
shinu can check out that video thing I
like about this is that yeah it's like
warm Browns like everyone is doing but
there's some different shades in here so
a few cool tone shades in here and
they're just some really unique shades
like this purple shade that I have on my
lid right now there's a few shades in
here that I wouldn't reach for unless it
was in a palette I love that there is a
highlight shade for literally any skin
tone in here if you have a deeper skin
tone you can go in with one of these
Goldy ones or this one and then if
you're more close to my range you can go
in over here and you can use these as
eyeshadows too so all the highlight
shades look great as eyeshadows I've
been using the white shade for my inner
corner it's what I have one right now
the matte shades in here are super soft
pigmented easy to blend but they don't
blend away so awesome job Carly I think
this is beautiful it's super affordable
to most reach for blush lately has been
the makeup revolution blushing hearts
candy queen of hearts blush it looks
kind of like the two-faced heart blushes
except they're 50 times better
usually there's swirl all these or just
dip my brush into this top color right
here
so what I have on my cheeks right now it
gives you a nice kind of pink flush
without being overpowering it obviously
is more of a glowy blush it's not matte
or anything
I like that because it doesn't give you
the highlighted look like that's just my
highlighter right there as far as my
actual cheeks it doesn't look like I
have highlighter on my cheeks again
super affordable great these are newer
release but I had to mention these
because I've just been surprised in a
good way by these these are the makeup
ever aqua excel color paints when I open
this jar package I was not excited about
these to be totally honest until I
watched Sam Sherman's
eye swatch video where she swatch all
these on her eyes as soon as I saw that
video I got these out and started
playing around with them so these are
basically super pigmented cream kind of
eyeshadows that you squeeze out you can
use them as a base you can use them as
eyeshadow alone
liner I haven't tried them for liner yet
but that's what they say you can do em
24 is that crazy - yo shade that I wore
in the ordinary foundation video today
as a base I use em 56 by the way what is
up with makeup Forever's names can they
name these more exciting please like a
beautiful matte kind of taupe brown
shades they have tons of colors I think
they actually have some shimmery ones
I've only tried the white shimmery one
which I wasn't that impressed by I can't
find the white matte one but I can give
a white matte one - which would be
awesome at the base
Simon swatch these for for you just you
can see how insane they are been
applying them with just like a concealer
kind of brush you brush like this will
work great to apply with you
Elsie's your finger mat works fine but
these are so crazy opaque a completely
dry down they're not going to budge they
don't crease they just totally nailed
the formula ZZZ whether you want more of
a neutral one as a base or you want some
crazy color I just think these are
totally worth it I feel like these are
what I was hoping the milk makeup
pigments would be and I did not like
those I mentioned those in a reject also
link Sam's video down below if you want
to see what each shade looks like on the
eye she did a whole video on that the
last two things I want to mention are my
current favorite lip combo for a nude
list this is what I like when I want a
light nude but I want something a little
bit more pink tone so what I have on my
lips right now this is a Maybelline 105
nude whisper liner with 535 purely nude
matte lipstick the matte lipstick form
is our bit drying so as long as you
don't have super dry or like peeling
lips you should be fine
when I'm not filming 9 out of 10 times
they go for it and do blitz something
like this in the last reason rejects
video I mentioned my other favorite nude
lip combo so okay
on to rejects actually has a decent
amount of rejects so this first thing is
the urban decay meltdown makeup remover
cleansing oil stick so this thing does
take off your makeup what I don't like
is that it's literally like a giant glue
stick supposed to put on your face and
then kind of rub it in with your fingers
and it's let's take everything off it
does take everything off I just freakin
pulls on your skin it does not glide on
smooth like you would think with an oil
it really tugs out your skin which is
what I don't like about it I also just
think this probably can't be very
sanitary right something about putting
this on your like makeup dirty face and
then using it again I guess you could
wipe it down between uses you should
probably do that I'll stick with my
makeup wipes next reject is by morphe
this is their prep and set spray it's
cool because this is actually in like an
air sprawl aerosol aerosol spray can so
when you spray it's like a super super
fine mist and it smells really good
like this scent should be in a body
lotion it almost smells like dancing
waters by whoever that was I love this
spray and I love the smell of it what I
don't like is that it almost leaves like
a sticky like I can feel it on my arm
where it just fell it leaves a little
bit of a sticky thing to it which I
actually don't notice a whole lot when
it's on my face I just feel like it does
literally nothing
try this probably around 8
now now I'm gonna feel like when I spray
it on it makes my foundation look worse
like immediately and then it just does
nothing for helping the makeup stay on
longer making it look better throughout
the day this one I think is a pass for
me it's unfortunate that the actual
project does nothing because I like
everything else about it
next is the elf brush cleanser wipes you
get ten individually little wrapped
wipes in here so these are not supposed
to replace your like deep cleaning of
your brushes it's just supposed to be
kind of an on-the-go thing if you're
traveling or if you just need to clean
off a brush really quick these actually
remove the product really well from the
brush what I did not like at all is that
it leaves a total oily residue on your
brush which you then have to wash your
brush so it just completely defeats the
purpose of being quick and not having to
wash your brush if you try and go in
with product after you use these you'll
just have an oily brush with product on
it by the way I usually use the dr.
Bronner's soap it's awesome you can get
at Ross or TJ Maxx or Marshalls any of
the stores for like 6 bucks so
Maybelline brow drama brow mascara what
the actual were they thinking with
this launch so as you can see this thing
looks like a freaking cactus or
something here's the size compared to my
brow will must just drop that on my face
I don't know how you're supposed to
actually get your Brown on your face you
have very large brows with a lot of
surface area this might work but I think
for the average brow shape this is just
a little absurd I can't even use it
without getting product on my face if
you actually have another thing from
Urban Decay this one I wanted to like so
bad because I love the tone of this this
is their naked skin shapeshifter so the
highlighter in here is really nice I
actually haven't tried this light cream
shade I want to try it to set my under
eyes but the reject product for me are
these contour shades I love the tone of
this one I wish the formula was
different because these are like
eyeshadows the pigmentation - these are
just way too intense to be contour
shades or bronzer shades actually a
little bit absurd not only are they
super pigmented but I find them to be
really difficult to blend out every time
I tried to use these I've had to go in
with face powder over top of it to tone
it down and really blend it out because
they just don't blend on their own under
this mirror you get cream shades which I
haven't even touched because I'm not a
named contour highlight person at all so
I can't speak to those I'm just speaking
to the contour shades in here way too
pigmented next is another thing by
Maybelline this is the master duo
eyeliner so I actually tried this in the
dad buy some makeup video if you haven't
seen that I'll put it an eye over here
and down below that's when my dad went
shopping and he picked out this he
actually did pretty well except for this
he actually had to chop off the top of
this because there was a ball on the end
again Maybelline what is with them
putting balls on the ends of things we
don't need balls on the end of all of
our products especially with an eye
liner I have no idea how that's supposed
to work boiler alert it didn't even when
my dad chopped off the ball in here to
get that like finer point the actual
product is just horrible so wanted to
scratch you you can't get a full black
line it's just would not recommend in
the last reject was fairly recent
foundation Friday video it's a target
clay stick foundation usually when I
don't like a foundation I keep it just
for future videos and whatever but this
one I am going to be returning because I
just who this looks bad this just
completely breaks down on my skin kicks
up in weird areas even when you
initially put it on it feel like it's
kind of like melting off of your face
the stick foundation playlist so if you
want to see other stick foundation
reviews and ones that I do like that
will be down below so those are all my
raves and rejects I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did make sure
you give it a thumbs up let me know what
your favorite products were from the
month down below or your rejects I'm
always curious to hear your thoughts on
things that you guys have tried so if
you'd like something that I talked about
