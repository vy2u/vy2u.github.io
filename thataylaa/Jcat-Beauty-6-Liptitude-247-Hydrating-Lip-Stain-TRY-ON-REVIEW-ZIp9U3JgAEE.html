blot my lipstick right now
world's best nice alright so today we
have a video on the brand new J cat
Beauty 24/7 hydrating lip stains I'm
gonna be swatching some of these or not
swatching I'm gonna be putting them on
my lips and I'm also gonna be just
talking about them and sharing my
thoughts so that's what we're doing
today so I have six shades of these they
come in fourteen shades on jcat beauty's
website these retail for $5.99 each
which is a freaking steal for the
quality of these so I'm just going to
read a few of the claims that they have
on their website says it's a long-wear
lip stain that delivers intense color
with no sticky residue
they have mineral based skin
conditioning emollients which makes a
lip stain stay on for hours with high
impact standing pig nip stamp staining
pigments there we go
so the high pigment claim is completely
true this is what the wand looks like it
is actually perfect because it's not
super bendy you can still get in the
lines of your lips it's actually super
easy to control and handle is kind of
like a nail polish bottle so it's easy
to hold it they smell super mint to you
which I'm a fan of so when you first
apply it on your lips as you'll see when
I try them on they go on extremely
pigmented it is moisturizing in the best
way possible my NYX soft matte lip
creams those go on and I just feel like
they're gonna slide off my lips like
there's not enough grip to them or
something I'm not a huge fan of the
consistency of those I know a lot of
people love those these there's
something about it where it's not sticky
but it feels like it's gonna stay on
your lips so once you initially apply it
if you don't Pat it down with a tissue
or something it takes for freaking ever
to dry it's not quick drying at all I
feel like with most lip stains or kind
of long-lasting products they dry
superfast into like a matte finish these
ones aren't matte unless you pat them
down like I did right now the first time
I applied these it took about twenty to
twenty-five minutes for the project to
actually dry that's something that I'm
not a huge fan of because in the morning
when I'm going to work or something I
just want to apply it and have it stay
on and I don't want to have to worry
about like drinking coffee 20 minutes
later
then it coming off so I definitely Pat
it down with the tissue right after I
apply it just kind of mattify it and
make it so it stays on it also will get
on your teeth while it is wet as soon as
I Pat it down I don't have any issues
it's staying on we're good to go
it does last all day on me but if I'm
eating some kind of like food that has
oil in it or something I do notice that
it starts to come off on the inside of
my lips the outside stays pretty well
throughout the day with like eating and
drinking coffee and whatever and just
living life I like that when I Pat it
down I don't really lose any of the
color it really does like stain your
lips for $5.99 I think Jacob you did a
killer job on these so if you want to
see how each of these shades looks on my
lips you're in the right place just keep
watching all right so I have six shades
of these guys right here I haven't been
able to find the actual names of them I
don't think they have like word names
they only have number names I think this
table is like missing a leg let me start
off with the lighter ones the lightest
one I have is right here they smell
exactly like the LA girl or the LA I
always get the girl and the colors in
the splash mixed up why is there three
things I have a lake
they smell exactly like those glazed lip
paints they're kind of minty which I
really like I don't like fruity smelling
stuff on my lips I prefer this these are
insanely pigmented as you can see they
go on so smooth the consistency of these
is kind of like addicting like I feel
like I could just rub these on my lips
for hours this is obviously a little bit
worn G for my skin tone but I have been
enjoying putting this on top of other
lip liners they just make your lips look
so smooth and feels like super
moisturizing next we have this light
pink shade the colors in the bottle are
a little bit deceiving there way
brighter than they look so sounds like a
neon coral kind of baby pink like look
at that as you can see I have a little
bit on my tooth the one thing you have
to be careful about what these is making
sure that you put a paper towel on the
inside of your lip to kind of Pat it
down because they will get on your teeth
before they're dry again crazy pigmented
this is literally like neon on my lips
right now this will look good with like
darker liner around it obviously all
right next we have my absolute favorite
shade which is this one I like wearing
this one by itself I like wearing this
one by mixing stuff let's show you oh
they just go on so smooth consistency is
seriously unlike any lip product I've
ever owned this looks a little bit like
drug cosmetics
1995 to me this is a perfect like deep
brownie 90s kind of new that everyone's
super into right now I can't own this
one down really well either by mixing it
with the lightest shade or by mixing it
with color pop cookie this is definitely
my favorite one in the bunch right now
we're gonna go in with this fuchsia
shade right here I actually wore this on
my birthday
and I really liked it cool story Taylor
people always ask how I put lipstick on
with my lip ring it's pretty simple I
literally go like this damn I think this
is a beautiful bright fuchsia shade if
you're in the market for one
I just I'm gonna go in with the purple
shade and I'm excited to try this one
cuz I haven't actually put this one on
yet it looks like it's a nice blue tone
purple oh hell yeah I actually really
like this one it's not as purple as it
looks in the tube I thought this one was
gonna be like straight-up purple but as
you can see it looks like kind of just
like a fuchsia but with a tint of purple
it went on really nice feels nice like
the other ones alright so this is the
last shade this is the red shade I
really like this one
it's a nice blue based red so it makes
your teeth look white I'm gonna try and
blot it so you guys can see how it looks
and how that works except I don't have a
tissue
I'm using my aunt's birthday card to
blot my lipstick right now world's best
niece so you can see it kind of start to
mattify as you bought it it definitely
does set you just have to give it time
even after you pad it it still feels
completely moisturizing like my lips
don't feel dry at all right now so that
was all swatches of the Jake a beauty
lip stains all six shades that I own if
you guys are getting this in your epsy
bag let me know your thoughts on them
down below so if you guys like this
video give it a thumbs up so I
was an enthusiastic one love you guys
