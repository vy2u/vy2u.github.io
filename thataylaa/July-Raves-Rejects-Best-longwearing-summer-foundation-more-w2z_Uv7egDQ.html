rejects
I'm excited to film this video mostly
because it means that July is over so I
was kind of the month from hell for me
freaking stoked it's August we have a
lot a lot of July favorites this month I
didn't film the June raves and rejects
but I just whispering in that bowl intro
feel like nom yelling I didn't film a
June reason rejects last month so this
month I have a ton of stuff these
are products that I've literally been
using every single day for the last like
month and a half to two months and some
of them are a tad random okay so first
we have to give a shout out to the
foundation that I wore in Atlanta it was
the only foundation I brought to Atlanta
and this is the Revlon Colorstay whipped
foundation in 110 ivory I have a super
old a review on this back in the
self-tanning days I'll link it down
below if you want to see that if you're
looking for a long-lasting foundation
that will literally last through
anything you need this we hosted an
event in 95-degree heat with 50%
humidity and no a/c and this literally
lasted throughout the entire event I was
like dripping sweat cute it completely
stayed on my forehead stayed on my
entire face and it looked great I
usually use my Sigma f80 two kabuki
brush to apply this I just like the way
that it looks together and the shade is
perfect if you have fair skin it's pale
enough yeh Revlon the next thing which I
was kind of debating mentioning this
because I mentioned it before but I
actually liked it for a different
purpose and if you guys have seen my
videos you know their favorite contour
shade of life lately has been this one
right here from the my sculpted face
palette by it cosmetics I was kind of
ignoring the highlight for some reason I
don't know why because it is literally
beautiful I'm not wearing it right now
because I didn't know I was filming this
video or else I would have but it is
this shimmery light pink highlight it
looks like pink in the pan so once you
put it on your face it is like a
gorgeous shimmery white color and it is
just insane like look at that in the
same favorite brush to apply blush this
month has been the cosmetics all right
they have no
name or number on here it literally just
says a cosmetics I'll try to find this
and link it down below
slanted stippling brush I don't know
what this was made for but I use it to
apply blush and it literally just blends
out your blush flawlessly and it is so
freakin soft I love it cosmetics brushes
they're expensive
but for a reason yeah I hope they can
find the name of this eyeshadow palettes
that I've been using almost every day
this month has been the Too Faced
chocolate bar palette mostly just the
shade salted caramel probably like 90%
of the month I didn't actually wear
eyeshadow I only wore salted caramel in
my crease and then I threw on a little
bit of the mascara I'm about to talk
about I just love this shade this is
like the perfect crease transition shade
it's warm character is a caramel or
caramel whoa didn't wanna take the
mirror thing off the other eyeshadow
palette is the pure minerals soul mattes
pellet the name cracks me up every time
this is a matte eyeshadow palette and I
actually did a tutorial shot on choice
video using this palette these are
probably the softest matte shadows I've
ever used I'll blend out effortlessly
they're just so freakin soft and I'm
just obsessed with like these colors in
here I haven't heard anyone talk about
this palette before and I feel like you
need it in your life the mascara that I
mentioned before I've been using every
single day is the Too Faced better than
sex mascara the first couple times I use
this I was like not that crazy about it
the formula is super wet but holy crap I
like haven't been wearing eyeliner
lately I've only been using this mascara
and for some reason it really gets my
like outer lashes to make my eyes look
bigger
I might actually like this better than
the benefit roller lash here's the wand
and this isn't something that I would
like usually go for I don't know what it
is about this but one coat and you're
good to go so for a hair this month I've
been going for this like natural
voluminous kind of wave kind of thing I
don't even know what this is I'm not
wearing a bra right now is this fun
basically just been watching my hair at
night and then when I get out of the
shower I put in this Sally Hershberger
glam waves this smells amazing it's like
a foam consistency and it smells like a
perfume can get this at the drugstore I
got this at Bartel
suits into fine waves or stores moisture
and Tim's frizz and so I basically just
put it in my hair scrunch it a night put
it in a braid go to sleep wake up and
then all I do is going with the bombay
Gold Collection one I believe this set
comes with three different ones this
looks like a 3/4 inch to me I don't know
why they don't just write down the thing
but I love this I basically just use it
for the front part and then I put a
couple like random curls I feel like
it's a good mix of like natural but you
still tried I do have a 20% off code for
Bombay it's just tailored to and you can
use that get 20% off your entire order
my Holy Grail favorite straightener I've
ever tried is by Bombay as well a link
both of those down below but I mentioned
that in another favourites video right
this is pretty random but I went to his
phase where like no deodorants were
working on me not a good combo and
there's like 90 degrees Seattle heat all
summer I've been on a deodorant hunt and
I went from having no deodorants they
worked on me to like two that I really
loved the first is the secret invisible
solve Brazil
this is rainforest Smithson and if you
like guide to go to this smells like man
and it works just as well as the guy
deodorant secret deodorant usually
doesn't work on me at all this one for
whatever reason laughs throughout the
entire day and just keeps me smelling
good this one is brand-new this is the
Dove dry spray and I found this because
I was looking online and this one had
really good reviews and it's basically
just a spray so you just spray it like
this inside your shirt obviously I just
put it on before I get dressed and you
can do that because it doesn't leave
white marks anywhere it is completely
dry it's not wet and like gel and gross
feeling when you put it on it's
literally just a dry spray and then you
put on your shirt and you're good to go
so these last two products as a little
bit hesitant to mention just because I
have super mixed feelings on this
product this is these are the colour-pop
ultra matte lips the color of these is
why I've been wearing them every single
day and I literally have been wearing
these two colors every single day for
the last month this is a shade middie
and then trap you have to wipe this off
your hand like superfast or else it will
stay in your hand but here's trap dark
mauve kind of color and then middie is
what I've been wearing
like to work everyday it's a lot lighter
and it's just more of a neutral nude
color so there's my dealers trap I'm
gonna have a lower view on these so I
don't want to give too much away but
love the colors of all of them the
formula is very drying like very drying
all right I have 2 rejects this month
and they're both concealers by
Maybelline this is the maybelline
superstay better skin concealer and then
this one is the covergirl already such
is that focusing Ready Set gorgeous
concealer so let's start with the
covergirl Ready Set gorgeous concealer
the shade of this is pretty light the
formula I really couldn't do the formula
it didn't give good enough coverage the
concealer wand is like a stick so it
doesn't Bend at all and it just feels
super cheap to me can't deal with this
wrong but the product alone is
definitely more of like a light coverage
concealer this isn't gonna work if you
like full coverage under your eyes or
you have a lot of dark circles to cover
up when you blend it out it just kind of
feels like a super cheap concealer like
it kinda reminds me of like the wet and
wild concealers the maybelline superstay
better skin concealer was definitely
better than that one
this one gives more coverage and it does
last all day it just didn't like blow me
away at all lightest shade is pretty
dark it is 10 I rate a lot darker than
the other concealer this one isn't
horrible it gives better coverage and it
definitely blends out nicer and like
dries faster it just didn't blow me away
I don't know if it's just because the
shade is off personally I don't think
either of those are worth your money and
I'll probably be returning these so
those are all the raves and rejects for
this month because I'm doing so much
like home decor decorating kind of stuff
right now I have a lot of like home
favorites this month let me know if you
guys ever want to see a separate video I
need to shave my legs so bad right now
if you guys like this video and you want
raves and rejects to continue give it a
thumbs up so I know love you guys thanks
for watching see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
