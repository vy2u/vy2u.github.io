for you guys the I like and I
hate first thing that I tried out and
loved this month is the Ardell 120 demi
whispies I don't have little box things
as I'm wearing them right now
yeah this is what they look like I look
like the thing this off from Ice Age
right now I've never been down to buy a
$5 pair of false lashes like you don't
need those especially and I can get a
whole box of them off eBay for $2 but I
was in the drugstore and I was like I'm
gonna see what all the damn - it's about
these 120 damn whiskies and I have these
things on I feel like I'm wearing the
Rolex of false lashes
my next favorite this is the product and
this bye mate their websites mate makeup
company calm and it is this nude
lipstick in the colour naked truth and
clearly I've used a lot of it because it
used to be like a normal pointy looking
lipstick so if you want a new lipstick
that isn't going to wash you out but you
still want to have like a new type of
lip it's what I'm wearing right now I
just filmed a tutorial by the way on
this look I don't know when it'll be up
my next favorite is this thing okay I
told myself I wasn't gonna buy this damn
palette because honestly I wasn't that
impressed with the Naked 2 palette I
liked about two shades from it and
that's about it but I had a 40% off
coupon for Urban Decay from I'm at so I
was like I have to would you pass that
up
no I love this thing 50 times more than
the Naked 2 palette you guys have
probably all seen this 5 billion times
but these are the colors and I think I
like it more because it has these like
matte colors naked where's naked right
here naked is the perfect transition
color for your crease I don't care what
look I'm wearing that is my go to
transition color now it just helps blend
all of your eyeshadows together and kind
like that makes sense to anyone I don't
think so I would totally be okay with
only using this palette for the rest of
my life actually I'd probably get pretty
bored but it's good for everyday makeup
doesn't appoint the next favorite of
mine is a perfume and it's the Ralph
Lauren hot Ralph Lauren whatever and
clearly it's a favorite because it's
almost gone I totally forgot I had this
perfume and whenever I come home from
college
it's like Christmas because I
discover like in my room that I
forgot I had like I found an Essie nail
polish in my sock drawer the other day
tell me how that works
I'm absolutely horrible at describing
scents so I'm not even gonna go there
but it reminds me of a mix of Britney
Spears fantasy and playboy naughty it's
probably embarrassing that I know what
playboy naughty smells like but I was in
Walmart the other day and I was like
spraying all the perfumes on me and I
sprayed that and it smells freaking
amazing they kept like smelling it on my
arm like damn this smells good but I
don't know I just couldn't justify
buying a playboy perfume like what if
someone asks you what you're wearing
what do you say playboy Noddy I'm pretty
sure I mentioned this next product in
like a early like one of my first videos
ever
but it's the Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray and I honestly am unsure
as to how I lived without this product
in my life before
hey I spray it before and after I apply
in my face makeup I didn't used to like
buy into the whole setting spray things
because the only thing I tried was the
elf setting spray which doesn't do
it's like water on your face I notice a
huge difference in the glass ting power
and just the finish of my makeup when I
don't apply this it's retails for $28 I
believe and it is worth every single
penny I will keep repurchasing this
forever I have like three backups right
now you're unsure and don't
by into hole makeup setting spray thing
like I did you can try this get this a
Sephora and if you don't like it you can
use up to like half the bottle that the
lady said and then return it we're just
kind of weird to me so if you don't like
it keep your seat and you can return it
okay now I have some non Beauty
favorites
before like I said - yeah I have before
I move on to the rejects of the month
the first one is a channel that I
randomly came across from reading an
article they are the knife Knowles it is
a vlogging couple kind of like the
Shaytards which I don't watch or
boyfriend or girlfriend or what are my
favorite
it's duty time except they're 50 times
more hilarious they just had a little
baby and Austin the husband dad whatever
it's hilarious he reminds me of Jim
Carrey and then his wife Brittany is
like this fricking hot mom who is so
sweet and funny and I don't know I just
really really enjoy watching their
videos and I feel like I haven't heard
anyone talk about them before so I
wanted to share them with you guys
because if you like watching YouTube
videos that make you laugh in our
entertaining then I would definitely go
check them out subscribe if you do tell
them I sent you last night I literally
watched like 12 of their videos in a row
and was crying laughing I don't know
they're just really fun to watch and
yeah second favorite of mine that isn't
a beauty thing is the Jillian Michaels
30 day shred DVD got it off Amazon for
like I don't know eight dollars because
I was like I don't have a gym membership
since I'm just here for the summer and
get back into shape after college like
killing me jillian is no joke I thought
it was gonna be like a you know just
like getting toned workout no you're
gonna be like pouring wet in
sweat when you're done there's my dog
the UPS guys walking up right now
anyways what was I even saying what it
is is every day for 30 days you're
supposed to do the DVD and it's a
20-minute intense very intense
to work out and there's three different
levels which I like and in every level
there's like two girls behind Jillian
who do modified versions or harder
versions so you can kind of choose the
level you want she works muscles that I
never knew I had
yeah still going I'm like on day 16
right now so I'm like halfway done and
it's great because I have all of her
one-liners memorized all right now on to
rejects this product was sent to me like
I told you earlier regardless of whether
it was sent to me or not I'm gonna tell
you if a product sucks this company said
that they were sending me an anti-aging
cream which I was like great because I
have like a fear of aging not gonna get
into it and I got this it is called 100%
raw and natural wrinkle butter with
earthworm complex another word for
saying earthworm this has
earthworm in it why would I be down
to put earthworm poop on my face I
really wanted to try it out and like it
oh I just like which there's my dog
again I really wanted to try it out and
be like yeah I wear earthworm castings
to bed what up and just like rock it I
put this on my face about two minutes
later I wanted to puke
it looks like dried look I saw don't you
want to open this it looks oh it looks
like dry cement and mud and poop mix and
it smells horrid god I wish you could
like virtually smell this is meant
to be in a toilet or in little
earthworms case in the ground not on my
face my second reject is this Victoria's
Secret shimmer stick or whatever it's
called luminous cheek and face
highlighter and it's in the color
Showtime and when I first put this on I
really liked it and then I realized why
I was on clearance this is one of those
products where there's like a I don't
even know what that's called there's a
layer of the shine on top and then once
you rub that layer off it sucks
here's what it looks like and I would
swatch it but nothing shows up because
there's this is
nothing like what is this I don't know
that was my July Braves and rejects if
