now and it is surprisingly comfortable
all right so today we have July rings
and rejects cannot believe it's the end
of July where the heck did time go I've
already been in Seattle for a month it's
so bizarre it's gone by super fast so
don't that many rays for this month this
is gonna be a random one so the first
thing I wanted to talk about which I
mentioned in one of my shadow and
schmooze videos is the Lancome dewy mist
in love setting spray it smells
absolutely horrible so if you're like a
scent person and sentence really brought
their you then you probably wouldn't be
able to deal with this on your face but
if you can overlook the horrendously
strong smell this is an amazing product
for making your skin look dewy you
literally only need one spray and
sometimes I'll just spray it in my hand
and rub it on my face before my makeup
it's awesome because you can make any
foundation dewy so if you have naturally
oily skin and you like to use a matte
foundation but you still want that like
flowy kind of look then just spray this
a couple times on top you'll be glowing
I got this from a CCO it's originally
pretty pricey I think it's like $38 I
got it for 15 so I'll try and find it
online and link it down below for you
guys if you're like a die-hard do a skin
fan then this is probably gonna be worth
it for you my next wave of the month is
the Ben Nye luxury powder in cameo if
you watch youtube videos you've probably
heard banana powder been talked about
before banana powder only works for a
certain skin tone if you have fair skin
probably don't want to be putting banana
powder on your face but Ben Nye makes
the same powder in different colors
which no one talks about so this is the
shade cameo I used to use this for only
under my eyes and now I just use this as
an all-over face powder I was having
issues with my laura geller powder
because i realized it doesn't hold out
very well throughout the day I love the
powder but it's not very long-lasting so
I've been kind of switching it up in
sandwich powders I like for keeping all
my makeup all day this powder has been
doing the job this stuff is super
affordable you can get it off of ebay or
amazon so the next two products are
skincare products and
both things that I got in my Mimi box if
you haven't seen that I will link it
over here these are two things that
really stuck out to me I've been using
them for about four weeks now I really
really am all about the galacto my C's
80 eye cream I noticed this a huge-ass
tube for eye cream they're usually in
like a tiny jars I'm not a fan of the
smell but the actual product works
really great I put it on at night and I
also put it on in the morning before I
do my makeup and let it sit there for
about 10 minutes I just find that my
under eye is so much more moisturize now
if you have a problem with creasing with
your concealer I would definitely
recommend trying an eye cream I looked
up what the heck khalaqtu my C's are and
that's basically a branch of fungi which
helps to moisturize your skin the second
rave from the mini box is the 5a
cleansing gel for oily and shiny skin
first off this smells freaking amazing
it smells like it could be a perfume and
a hair it doesn't like that very much
but it leaves your skin feeling super
cleanse just like strips your face of
everything without making it feel dry
I'll use my Neutrogena face wash and
then to just get all like the residue
off I just like to go over it with this
stuff I really like the way it makes my
skin feel my next rave which is pretty
freakin random is this bad-boy
old-school hot rollers I have never used
hot rollers before if you are not a
morning person
like I am these might be your lifesaver
since I literally can't give two shits
in the morning about my hair I figured I
would try these out can get them off of
Amazon and they have four big rollers
right here okay and then the purple ones
are eight smaller rollers I heat up in
like 60 seconds I'll literally just roll
them in my hair in the morning do my
makeup and then I'm done with my makeup
I take them out in my hair looks like I
just spent like a half hour on it but I
literally spent like three minutes tops
my kind of hair product less to products
are both makeup products the first one
is the cosmetics celebration foundation
illumination in fair I will link the
shadow news video I have where I use
this
I feel like I have to hiccup yeah there
we go but I've just been really feeling
this powder if you like illuminating
products then you will love this it
gives you really great coverage you can
wear it on your own or you can wear it
as a setting powder really happy that
the fair shade is actually fair enough
it looks kind of dark in the pan but
once you put it on your face it totally
works
I got mine off with QVC and it came with
a really nice brush that I've been
loving for blush I don't like it to
apply the foundation I just used the ELF
powder brush this is the first it
cosmetics product I've tried and I kind
of want to go get more my last rave of
the month is the whitening lightening
gloss in sugar mama I don't know why I
looked at the bottom I should like know
this by heart right now I know I have
literally mentioned this I feel like in
every video this month but that's
because it is amazeballs I don't know
how I didn't get on the whitening
lightening train before this these
glosses really are the I don't know
what it is about these I'm usually not a
gloss person at all but I actually like
look forward to putting this on in the
morning sugar mama and butter cream are
my two favorite colors if you were only
gonna buy one I would go with sugar mama
I just feel like it's a super flattering
light pink nude color have it in the
same shadow in this video as the
cosmetics product so if you want to see
these two in action you can just go
watch that video I only have one reject
this month and this is the NYX honey do
me up I was super freaking excited to
try this because first of all look at
the packaging second role it says it has
gold flakes in it who doesn't want to
put gold flakes on their face if this
product just did literally nothing for
me I don't know there's a secret way to
apply this or some doesn't feel
like a primer it doesn't feel like a
moisturizer it doesn't feel like a gel
it just feels like goo on your face and
it doesn't do anything if you've tried
this and you liked it let me know how
you apply it or what you do with it
because not doing anything for me that
was my July raisin rejects
comment down below what your favorite
products were for July and if you think
I need to try anything let me know down
below I do have a shadow news video on
the left I'm wearing
now I think it'll be up after this one
so make sure you're subscribed if you're
not already so you don't miss out on
that
love you guys thanks for watching see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
