I have like eight things to show you
guys for my favorites everyone says that
the month like flies by know this one
 crawled ok so my first favorite
for the month is like my favorite
product I think I've tried all year is
the gemma kid makeup school face hilar
in dewy glow looks like this and it's in
the color ice gold this is basically a
cream highlighter which is holy tits
amazing this is what it looks like on
the inside I have this like weird thing
with highlighters where I put it over my
powder and it usually like just doesn't
look good like it's like powder and then
shimmer and it like turns like a weird
gray color I don't know does anyone else
have that issue this thing is like
butter on your face and it gives you the
prettiest frickin glow ever this
normally is pretty expensive it's like
in the 30s I would never pay $30 well
maybe for this I would I will have it
down below in the downbar a link to a
European website which has urban decay
care products everything for for super
mark down I'm still smiling
after stop smiling stop which has
everything for super mark down so I got
this for around $18 for the quality of
this product is a really good deal and
also is free shipping comebacks I'm
gonna mention which I also got from that
website again will be done below is the
Kerastase Oreo relax slim originally why
I went on that website was to buy this
thing because when we were packing up
and moving out of my house at college my
mom came to help and I like had all of
my hair stuff packed away and so she had
this with her and I tried it out and I
like fell in love basically you apply
this when you get out of the shower I've
never had my hair it looks so unfroze E
and like tamed in my life it makes your
hair feel so soft it has a yeah it
smells amazing
this normally retails for like $48 here
that's the cheapest I found it on a u.s.
website and let me just say that I would
never spend freakin $48 on a hair
product ever unless it had like 24 karat
gold in it
this
stuff I got off that website for my
whole order was a total of 32 dollars so
if that was 18 whatever do the
difference that's what this was which is
such an amazing price and that's where
my mom got it from to the next two
products are self tanners the first one
is quick tan bronzing spray and medium
dark and the second one is Sun Goddess
in dark which has all over it so
these I have been using every single day
this one I use on my legs in my stomach
and back if I'm like wearing a swimsuit
and then this stuff I mix with lotion
and put it all over my chest and arms
and face this one you can get from folic
accom I'll put the link down below
basically I got this because I had a
like $20 gift certificate to them so I
used it on this I'm not sure how much it
retails before I think it's around $20
so everything is down below okay
everything I usually absolutely hate
spray tanners but this one I spray on
use one of the gloves and rub it in and
it gives you a flawless tan no streaks
nothing the color isn't orange has good
amount of color to it which is why I
like it for my legs and it lasts like
this thing laughter about three days
without fading at all which is amazing
for a self-tanner this one I'm not going
to talk too much about because I have a
whole other review coming for it but it
has a perfectly all live tone to it
which is what I love most about it yeah
love this the next two things are face
products the first one is the Revlon
Colorstay whipped foundation have a
whole other review on this which I will
link right here this stuff is amazing
I've been wearing it every single day I
always get compliments on my face and
how flawless it looks when I'm wearing
it is lady just like wandered up and was
like hey what's on your face I have
never had anyone asked me that about my
foundation before I rediscovered the
Maybelline fit me powder I had this
thing in the bottom of my jar it's not
completely full coverage I'd call a
medium coverage I don't know what it is
about it but it gives you a glowing
finish I don't know it's not like dewy
doesn't make you look oily or
anything like that just gives you a
really pretty glowy look next thing I'm
gonna talk about is my Moroccan argan
oil which is pure argan oil literally
imported from Morocco bottled in the USA
and this stuff is like literally
straight up from the tree or wherever
they get argan oil I think it's a tree
the only thing is this stuff smells very
strong as it's not processed or anything
like is literally straight-up argan oil
we're the ones that are sold in the u.s.
are usually processed have chemicals in
it and like fragrance so it doesn't
smell like this so what I've been doing
is we squirt it in the palm of my hand
in the shower and then putting my
conditioner also in my hand and then
just mix it together and put it all over
your hair like I usually start here and
go down I got this off of Etsy and I
will have the seller right here this is
like the real so the last two
things are nail polishes is the Revlon
Colorstay base coat and top coat these
together like I mentioned in my haul are
freaking amazing together your nail
polish literally lost about I would say
three to four days longer than it would
without a base coat and then when you
use the top coat with it it just gives
it this even finish I have it on my
nails right now if this is focusing get
them at Walmart for about five dollars
each which is way cheaper than at the
drugstore I'm done so that was
everything thumbs up if you like this
and I'll see you guys in my next video
