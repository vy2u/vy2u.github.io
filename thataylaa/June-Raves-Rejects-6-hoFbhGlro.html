hi guys so I am in a bit of a tizzy
right now I don't even know where to
start this story but literally about 12
minutes ago I got back from the beach my
roommate was leaving which he never
 does there was still a little
bit of Sun out so I figured that it was
my one and only chance to film
hence the no talking videos lately but
no I didn't go to the beach like this I
got ready in approximately eight minutes
slapped on some makeup they probably
have makeup in places where they don't
belong such as my teeth cool haven't
showered I've sand in my hair I'm
currently wearing swim suit bottoms and
I threw on this dress to make it look
like I'm really put together and things
this I don't even know what I'm filming
right now and now we haven't started
going on outside I guess what we're
filming is my hygiene slash in July I
don't know my favorites for the last
couple months since I haven't done a
favorites video in literally a year what
the hell is going on outside I'm gonna
try and film this fairly fast because I
can't even see the Sun right now but
somehow they're still a little bit of
light I have some stuff some of it is
from the Middle East
stuff that I picked up in Jordan and in
Israel why am i recording right now who
my makeup doesn't melt off right now
it'll be a freaking miracle okay let's
begin shall we
the first thing is this shampoo that I
picked up in Jordan I've seen it in
Israel too obviously
oh my god you've gotta be me I
hope you guys can't hear that but we're
gonna continue because we have no other
option I think I picked up is picked up
I've had this really here Vatika shampoo
this is the moisture treatment shampoo
yeah like I said I got it in Jordan it
has almond has almond honey yogurt spelt
y ou G H u RT s that I was just about to
make really bad joke but I refrain and
henna how do you have tenant and shampoo
I thought henna was not shampoo able
this stuff a smells amazing
B it makes your hair like literally when
I get out of the shower like I wouldn't
have to use conditioner I feel I still
do obviously but it feels really socks
this brand is like what my host family
had in Jordan and it's fairly cheap but
it's really good and they make some
really good like deep conditioners too
I'm sure you can get this somewhere in
the States or eBay or something
the next thing let's switch off American
Middle Eastern products give it a nice
flow Wow my hair is literally sticking
to my forehead and that will cat is
trying to get in that's going yes I'll
just do these two together because
they're the same brand is the covergirl
in LA where rehab it got it out that's
what matters a star concealer this is a
simply an ageless eye concealer in 205
this is the lightest shade I believe and
it obviously comes in a pot which I
really like and you can use like a brush
to apply I just swirl my finger in is
what it looks like has a really nice
consistency it's super creamy good
coverage I like it because it's kind of
paint based it doesn't give you that
like yellow I don't like the yellow
under Thomas doesn't do anything for me
unless you have yellow under it get when
I am together I feel like it let's just
get comfortable here okay next we have
the covergirl in LA Foundation and funny
story not that funny but it's a story so
we're gonna tell it and I'm itching my
leg on this chair because I horrible
what the mosquitos here are killer
anyways okay baby right now this
foundation my mother actually sent me
from America and I asked her to send me
the
new covergirl settled covergirl three
and one foundation and that's it happen
but I got this in the mail but thanks
mom cuz I actually really like this and
which surprised me like if I saw this in
the store I've never think to buy it but
I like it because okay that's really
dirty we're gonna ignore that but it has
a pump which is awesome so just the
consistency is so creamy what I usually
do like I did in my sweat proof makeup
get ready with me video which I'll link
down below is I put some of the Revlon
Colorstay foundation on the back of my
hand and then I'll put a pump of this
and it gives it a really nice creamy
texture I don't like the texture or like
the consistency of the color stay
foundation that much I think it's a
little like gluey I don't know the word
like it doesn't blend that easily to me
so if I put a pump of this in it gives
you like a little bit of a dewy finish
but you still have the foil control and
staying power from the Revlon Colorstay
mom this one's for you next is let's do
a Middle Eastern product and this is
cold
top beauty nail polish and it is
obviously white it's what I have on my
tips right now this brand I've only seen
in Israel I don't know good luck on
getting it it's really cheap but really
good it's super opaque you know the
point of putting us in here isn't to
tell you to buy this nail polish brand
is that I really like white hand polish
your summer specifically I think it just
looks really good when you have like
like right now I don't know I probably
wouldn't paint my nails all white
because they're too long but I think it
looks really good in the summer when you
have like nicely shaved kind of short
white nails I don't know if that's just
me or if I've been on Pinterest for too
long but I really like white nail polish
in summer next we have the elf High
Definition powder which I'm sure you've
all all have heard about I tried this a
few years ago I absolutely hated it and
then I was looking for transition
translucent powder and I didn't want my
camera just cut out not quite sure where
it stopped but as I was saying I used to
have major issues with getting mascara
on my concealer like for my bottom
lashes little dots that make sense
this stuff if you just put a little bit
what am I saying you put this under your
concealer on your under eye concealer
maybe you should just stop making video
today it completely sets it you won't
get creasing you won't get mascara line
all right my camera battery just died
and the Sun is literally about to set
over the building so I figured I would
just keep filming on my iPhone so sorry
for the quality this bad I also like
this transyl translucent powder because
it doesn't change the color of your
foundation so it would have a perfect
match for your foundation and then you
are having issues because you put a
setting powder right and then it doesn't
match your neck anymore which I was
happy for a while then this is perfect
because it's clear and it'll set your
makeup and it makes your face feel
pretty soft
alright so the next Middle East product
it is this Garnier pure long-lasting
shine control moisturizer and I picked
this up at super farm which is like the
big pharmacy here and it was on sale
and I really liked the Garnier skin line
everything I've tried has been amazing I
really like their face wash the oil
control face wash it really does control
your oil and it works and I really like
it and it smells really fresh and clean
so that's always a plus
last rave for June is this l'oreal
infallible eyeshadow but this is an iced
latte which i'm sure you guys have all
heard about however i think it is
gorgeous and iris
we discovered it comes with this little
press thing and you just take it out and
then the inside it looks like that oh so
pretty is what I have on my lid right
now it's just really pretty for the
summer if you don't want to do like a
whole I look and you want to do
something really fast just pop this on
it'll make you look like you have like
your eyeshadow done even though you
spent two seconds on it
and I only have a couple rejects for
this month ish the first one I
hate okay well we have a very lucky
relationship because I think it's an
awesome product and it does what it says
but let me just say the product is the
Rimmel stay matte I have another one
because I brought it from the US just so
you can actually see what it looks like
where it is okay show the out it's
great it's a great powder it completely
controls your oil it makes you look
completely mad however for my skin it
makes my skin horrible I have like acne
over here that gets really bad and I
started noticing a pattern that whenever
I use this like which I usually only is
when I don't have self-tanner on and I'm
like really really white but when I use
this it gets 50 times more it's like I
can't even touch my skin my acne gets so
bad it hurts it's painful and I
definitely realized that I breakout when
I use this stuff it's a shame because
it's awesome and like it as a product
but you need to calm down
mouse um my second reject is this I
really really really wanted to like this
I had my mom send you this in the
package with some of that other stuff
because I can't tease my hair like my
hair is
so thick that it doesn't hold the t's
and I like the look like I love big ass
hair
I want big ass hair he just means bless
you I like big US hair but I can't get
it and so I thought that I would try
this powder got to be powder full of
volumizing styling powder oh wow
cats get sick it says it's for instant
volume and it has root lift root lift
texture control I don't know about the
root lift it doesn't really do that much
for me I don't know about the control
but the texture makes you feel like you
haven't washed your hair for a year and
that usually doesn't bother me like I
don't wash my hair up he couldn't lead
to be honest
however this stuff literally feels like
you poured some kind of concoction in
your hair that should not be there
you're supposed to like powder it and
then rub it and it gets all big and
things up here your hands like feel
sticky afterwards like I don't know how
to describe it but it's absolutely
disgusting alright I think the Sun is
officially down now and we are done with
all the products that I've laid out just
say hi for us stop trying to make it
appearance just do your thing
that's anyways this is not my cat it's
