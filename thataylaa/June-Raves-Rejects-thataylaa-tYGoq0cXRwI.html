myself for rallying and filming right
now I was in Southern California this
morning now I'm back in the Pacific
Northwest I have one day to pack all my
shit
this will all be empty then I moved to
Seattle on July 1st literally just got
back here ran some errands got moving
boxes threw on some black lipstick and
now I'm filming so excited so much shit
to do a little stressed but it all work
out because I have a rock star probably
shouldn't try to drink rock star with
black lipstick on by the way and I'm
gonna get questions on my lips right now
is the Manic Panic matte black lipstick
in nas fur off - don't know how to say
that sounds like an African tribe
anyways it is 7:35 out right now so I
have literally about a half hour to film
before I have no light so today we have
June raves and rejects I don't have that
many things this month I have a few
things that I'm really stoked about and
a few things that I'm really not stoked
about
I think I'm gonna start with two lip
products because I feel like I'm most
excited about them the first is the
Stila stay all day liquid lipstick in
patina this is so beautiful if you've
been following my Instagram you've seen
this but it's basically a matte liquid
lipstick which I'm really all about the
liquid lipsticks I really like my pretty
zombie cosmetics ones this one is even
more moisturizing but I do find that
these kind of come off a little bit
easier
it smells like cupcakes in heaven
cupcakes are heaven well insert a couple
pictures so you can see the color on my
lips but it's like a beautiful dusty
rose kind of color I've been wearing
this when I don't want the hassle of
putting on a red lipstick but I want to
look a little bit more put together the
formula isn't as long-lasting as I
thought it would be if you're eating
foods that have oil in them it will
start to come off a little bit I usually
apply this every couple hours when I'm
wearing it so I don't think it's like a
stay all day kind of thing like it says
but the color is amazing so I can
overlook that next one is an oldie but a
goodie I've been reaching for this a lot
for my red this month this is the
covergirl I don't even know the full
names of these it comes with like this
and then the sealant thing will have the
full name listed below because I can't
think of it right now this is another
liquid lipstick this thing does not
budge it is a little bit more drying
than the Stila one about half the price
from the drugstore there's just a
beautiful deep red but it's not too dark
this is one of those Reds that would
look good on any skin tone smells like
cherry it's been reaching for this every
time I want to wear a red lip this month
and github next I have kind of an
interesting product or I think so hate
when you have an itch when you have
foundation on this is a polished choice
son 365 self-tan concentrate you guys
know I'm all about having the pale skin
I embrace it now I love it but there are
those days in summer where I want a
little bit of color just on my legs just
so I don't look so see-through on my
legs I haven't used this on the rest of
my body but I have used it on my legs
and it is a perfect super natural
looking I wouldn't even call it a tan
let me tell you what it is first this is
a self-tanning concentrate so it says to
mix it in with
loschen what I like about this is since
it's a concentrate you have complete
control of how deep you want your tan to
be for someone like me I usually do two
to three pumps on every portion of my
leg if that makes sense like the upper
portion I mixed it with lotion two or
three pumps same thing on the bottom and
that gives me the perfect color that I
want it does not look like you're
wearing a self-tanner at all I think it
looks more natural than Jergens natural
glow if you have fair skin and you're
afraid of trying a self-tanner but you
just want a little bit of color then I
would definitely recommend trying out
this I think it's a really smart concept
that you have control over how much you
want it and if you're someone that is
tan and you like a deep dark tan then
you could just put a few more pumps in
there you know my next rave of the month
is the Anastasia Anastasia whatever dip
brow pomade and mine is in the shade
dark brown I was quite skeptical to buy
this stuff because it seems like
everyone and their mom mentions it and I
didn't know if it was gonna be one of
those products that is overly hyped
about I bought this with my own money
off of Sephora
I really like the gel kind of formulas
for your brows I usually use a Mac one
this is what I'm wearing right now a
little bit goes a super long way as you
can tell I've only like dented it I wore
this to the lake and it stayed on all
day through the Sun through the sweat
through the water it didn't budge this
is awesome for summer you don't want
your brows to be sliding all over your
face so yes I do think that this is
worth all the hype it gets this is the
real shit next I have two face products
one of them I forgot to mention in my
may be of some rejects video is it it is
June right I forgot to mention this in
my favorites and rejects video and I
don't know how because I've been using
it literally everyday this is the Laura
Geller balance and Brighton powder and
porcelain when you swirl it together you
get this really nice fair powder it is a
little bit illuminating so it's not
gonna look cakey on your face at all
this is one of my favourite powders I've
ever tried if you've heard of this and
you've been wondering if it's worth the
money it totally is I got this OP hot
look for like half-price flash sale
sight which I will link down below but I
looked on QVC the other day and they
also have it it also has
dioxide I just realized on it so it has
SPF 15 which is nice
my next wave of the month it's a blush
which I've been wearing pretty much
almost every day if not this I wear my
wet and wild one which you guys have
heard me talk about five thousand times
is the Tarte Amazonian clay doll face
blush and this is supposed to be a 12
hour blush I don't know about that claim
by itself because depending on what
foundation you use underneath it helps
the longevity of your blush however this
color is freaking beautiful I have the
mini version I really like many versions
of things this is a really pretty kind
of doll pink shade I'll swatch it for
you guys there you go sometimes I think
my wet and wild blush can be a little
bit overpowering so if I'm doing kind of
a more intense eye look I just want to
tone down the cheeks I use this one and
it still gives me a pink flush without
being like whoa too much blush
girlfriend someone from Craigslist wants
to come over right now and pick up a
desk perfect timing
last but definitely not least is my baby
revealed 2 palette by Coastal Scents I
feel like he didn't breathe the whole
time I just said that I have a whole
review on this palette I used it in a
shadow movies get ready with me video
all those will be linked down below if
you want to watch them but this shop
Shalit Shalit this palette is so
beautiful I am literally in love with
the matte shades I have this shade on my
crease right now I've been using these
two shades almost every day blend out so
easily just a perfect palette and I
really like it
this is only in 1995 so if you didn't
want to spend and this one just fell out
maybe that's why it's 1995 if you didn't
want to spend $50 on The Naked 3 palette
which I would not do if I were you
I regret buying the Naked 3 palette I
would totally buy this one instead $30
cheaper and I think it's a lot better
quality than the Naked 3 palette I'm
just gonna say it I'm not a fan of the
Naked 3 palette
so I have a couple products this month
that I just despise so much that I feel
the need to mention them the first is
this NYX radiant finishing powder mosaic
thing it appealed to me because I
thought it was gonna be like my Holy
Grail Physicians Formula one which I've
hit pan on clearly nothing like that one
while it looks really appealing and
pastel II it is so chalky it comes off
more like blue than anything like I'm
not about to put this shit on my face I
might color with it but it comes off
really chalky I was going to use this
shade as a highlight I don't know if you
guys can see the texture of that but
it's just not good as soon as I'm done
filming this video I'm gonna throw this
thing out actually let's just do it
together
there we go next one is the la girl pro
primer I mentioned how much I hate this
in the eye Kate house haul video where I
got this room it is just unlike
something I have ever seen not in a good
way you swatch it it feels really nice
it feels really creamy it goes on fine
but as soon as you put eyeshadow on top
of it some weird thing happens where
it's like the primer sticks out
underneath the eyeshadow it clings to it
weird something's not right
just feels like something's wrong in
here that was my June raves and rejects
video if you guys like raves and rejects
videos be sure to give it a thumbs up so
I know comment down below with what your
favorite products of June were so I know
if I should check anything else out so
think this is the only video that's
going up that's gonna be like actual
real time when I'm filming this and
uploading it the next day the past two
videos and then the next few videos
we'll all be pre-recorded because of the
move and Seattle and work and all that
kind of stuff so if you want to be
caught up on everything in real time be
sure to follow my Instagram Twitter
Facebook page whatever you want to do I
update all of them love you guys thanks
for watching see you in my next video
