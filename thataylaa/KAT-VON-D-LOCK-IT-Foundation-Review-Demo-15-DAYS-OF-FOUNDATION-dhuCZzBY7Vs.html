don't even know what date is right now
we're going to go 12 fun facts sometimes
I feel these intros twice with two
different date numbers just in case
alright so today it is day 12 of 15 days
of foundation I'm feeling it you guys
feels like day 12 so as I mentioned
during day 1 say was day 6 Maybelline
fit me matte and poreless a couple of
these foundations during this series are
ones that have just been asked about a
ton by you guys and that I've already
tried out a few times and didn't have
good experiences with so I just never
kind of reach for them again so today
we're talking about the Kat Von D
lock-it tattoo foundation I have the
shade L 42 here and L 44 Kat Von D did
just recently come out with the shades L
41 and L 43 and there's now 30 shades in
the entire line I love when brands do
that many shades of foundation it is
awesome so just to give you a little
background on what I thought of this
shade this is the shade L 42 this is one
of the palest foundation shades out
there I'm not sure if L 41 is lighter
but I kind of want to get a little
sample thing from floor to see all right
swatch time I just did these swatches
and then talked on the phone for like 20
minutes so let's see if I remember all
of these right here we have the Kat Von
D locket tattoo foundation and l4d2 here
it is in L 44 this is the covergirl
Queen matte BB in the lightest shade
urban decay all nighter in 0.5 etude
house BB concealer foundation that I did
a review on during this series in the
lightest shade and derma called
208 which is the lightest shade of derma
call and I also have a review on this if
you are very very pale I did a whole
video on extremely pale like too pale
for me foundations and l42 is one of
those foundations for me this makes me
look very ghostly if you're extremely
fair l42 could work for you it has a ton
of pink in it so super quick my initial
thoughts with this I've tried this
foundation probably 5 or 6 times over
the years and every single time it just
looks super cakey it's super heavy on my
skin I have not understood the hype
about this product there's just
something a little bit off about it
looked very chalky very heavy and some
of you guys have told me that the
formula and L 42 is actually a little
bit different
in the wrestle line I'm not sure if
that's true I don't think cap on Diaz
ever like come out and said that so when
I heard that I wanted to pick up this
foundation in a different shade to see
and I picked up this shade on the lam
but here's my little the lam bot sticker
it's basically where you can buy and
sell pre-owned makeup I always shop on
there when they have when they're big
sales because that's really when you can
get a good deal I know they have one
coming up for Black Friday and I believe
I still have a thirty percent off coupon
code that works for you guys so I'll
link it down below in the description
box if you won't check it out but I got
this I think 10 or 15 bucks cheaper than
retail we get one fluid ounce of product
in here and this retails for $35 I'm
just going to read some of the claims on
here says it's a high pigment full
coverage foundation with a matte finish
in 24 hour wear now it's a new look in a
total of 30 shades oh yeah totally looks
different oh man wait where are you
going come back anyways just one light
layer this creamy formula corrects
discoloration stop shine and hides
blemishes sign me up
formulated with 21% pigment this
powerful foundation is loaded with
proprietary ingredients total matte
coverage a stays waterproof fade proof
and transfer resistant all day long says
Kat Von D does not test on animals and
this is also vegan so I think that's all
the claims we will see if l42 is any
different than L 44 if you're enjoying
15 days of foundation don't forget to
give this video a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the babe rito
family and subscribe it notifies you
every time and put up any video you want
to see how this foundation applies
somewhere throughout the day you're in
the right place just keep watching so
I've already washed moisturize prime my
face with the jouer anti blemish matte
primer I am breaking out a little bit
right now I don't know what it's coming
from I'm trying a new face wash too so
it could have been that but anyways I'm
gonna do a sponge brush I'm going to do
the AOA studio f4 this is a dollar
kabuki brush I'm gonna do this on one
side of my face and then my Real
Techniques miracle complexion sponge on
the other we're going to break the
glambot Seal of Approval so like I said
I'm going to be trying to shade l44
today have not tried this shade yet my
l42
looking pretty rough okay already the
consistency of this squirts out way
different than my l42
so I'm going to try my sponge first on
this side of my face
yeah I can already tell you this is way
different than the l42 that I have I
might have gotten a dead bottle because
this just went on way nicer than my l42
yeah what the heck way nicer so this
looks actually like smooth on my face
doesn't look heavy or cakey the l42 when
I put it on looks like I'm wearing a ton
of makeup this is just sitting on my
skin really nice this oxidizes it's
going to be too dark but right now I
think it can work okay so that one side
I think we did get pretty much full
coverage so let's try the brush side now
so it goes on totally fine with a brush
I think we got pretty much same exact
coverage but I do think it's easier to
apply and a little bit quicker with the
sponge
results look about the same though my
pores are looking pretty big right now
but that's kind of usual the rest of my
face looks really nice looks like satin
matte finish though so it's a little bit
dark you can see the line right here I
wonder if l43 would be better for me
this I have never gotten this kind of
finish or just texture with the l4d2 so
I'm pretty sure either the formula is
different in that one or I just got a
bad bottle right now I like this looks
really nice so we're going to call the
check-in time 9 o'clock I don't think
I'm going to set this with the powder
just because it is supposed to be
mattifying and good for all-day wear so
I kind of want to see how it holds up on
its own so it is 917 the rest of makeup
is on and I'm a little bit shocked by
this one in a good way just because I
despise l42 so much and this is like 180
this feels like a different foundation
to me let me know down below if you've
also experienced that with l42 or if I
just need to buy a new bottle
this doesn't look totally matte to me
you can see on my forehead there's a
little bit of like satin matte finish
going on which I love I don't like a
totally totally matte foundation it
feels like it's starting to totally sit
I didn't apply a powder on top blush
bronzer highlight blend it out totally
fine on top without a powder my only
complaint right now is
that it's settling in a little bit of
wrinkle up here it's creasing a tiny bit
on my forehead I'm hoping it doesn't do
that around my nose I don't know if you
guys will be able to see that but it's
kind of just settling into that one
little wrinkle right there so on the
rest of my face I did kind of a
throwback today used all products I
haven't used in a super long time
use my body shot bronzing powder and
zero one this is like oldie but a goodie
I used to love this thing
I didn't put blush on this is all that I
have on my cheeks Mac lightscapade skin
finish also love this and I got this
from glam bought like a couple years ago
and then as I use the Sephora and
Pantone palette which this is also from
a couple years ago I wish they made this
permanent because the colors in here I
feel like are so in right now all these
warms and like greens and stuff lips I
used Rimmel first class nude with a
little bit of NYX high voltage Mirage
over top did that whole thing without
even half a cup of coffee so I've been a
proud missable so we're going to wear
this throughout the day I will check
back in in a few hours okay it is now
1:27 so the foundations been on for
about four and a half hours I feel like
it's oxidized a little here's my neck
looks a bit dark I might need to go with
the 43 shade or makes it a tiny bit of L
42 from far away I feel like it looks
really nice just kind of matte and
smooth and then when you get really up
close so when you get really up close
and like actually look at the texture it
looks like it's almost separating a
little bit on my forehead especially in
the center of my face nothing major
really on the rest of my face my face
looks a little bit dry and under my lip
I am starting to get a little bit of
creasing I think the center of my
forehead right here is the only part
that doesn't look great I need a nice
moisturizing or smoothing primer under
this one because it does look like it
just needs a little something-something
last check and we'll be at 6 p.m. so
I'll check back with you guys then so it
is now what is on my hand right now
alright so now 708 so the foundation has
been on for 10 hours I didn't end up
going to the thing I was going to go to
so we've got an extra hour out of it for
being what's supposed to be a mattifying
foundation I feel like I look pretty
freaking Oh alarm to do this I feel like
I look pretty oily right now especially
my forehead and it looks like it's
broken down
a lot on my forehead as well it's kind
of like separating stuff not even in the
center of my face but kind of all over
my forehead I think next time this is
one that I would definitely set it does
look too dark now I think I would try
this again I would just set it with a
powder I do really like the coverage and
it looks really nice for the first few
hours I think it went on totally fine
I'm just not super super wowed by it at
this point but this might just be one of
those that I might fall in love with if
I use it with different products mature
skin or dry skin I would say stay away
from this one I don't think it really
will do anything for you
oily skin set with a powder regular skin
you probably be fine I hope you guys
liked this video if you did make sure
you give it a thumbs up love you guys
