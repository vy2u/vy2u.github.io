of foundation it feels like day 12 guys
I'm feeling it but I've got my t-shirt
on today understand the proceeds for
these go to project Beauty share so I'm
gonna leave a link down below this is
actually very fitting mantra for today
15 days of foundation is always a really
good mental challenge for me because
it's always around day 11 or day 12
we're really start to feel it so today
we were talking about the Koh Gendo aqua
foundation coach endo coach endo this
has been one of the most requested
foundations from you guys for a while
and I finally bit the bullet and got it
this thing is not cheap this product
retails for sixty two dollars and get
one point zero one ounce of the product
this is a Japanese foundation I've never
tried anything from Coach endo a little
bit about the brand if you've never
heard of them it says born in Tokyo and
raised on movie sets around the world
coach endo combines the planet's most
precious botanicals with Japanese
skincare technology to nourish and
protect your complexions natural ability
to regenerate and thrive
this foundation has been very talked
about very hyped up on YouTube only
comes in seven shades which is obviously
a major downside and it doesn't go deep
at all like I would say the darkest
shade looks like a medium kind of skin
tone I have the shade zero one two I'm
gonna insert shade swatches right here
so you can see how this foundation
compares to some of the other lies
foundations that I own right so swatch
time I was watching about four days of
videos right now so that's what we have
a ton with swatches right now
but here's the coach endo foundation in
the shade 12 next over is the Sephora
ten hour where foundation in the shade
ten Loreal Pro matte and 101 and 102
only included this because I was
watching this guide today and comb
custom foundation derma called 2:08 pur
cosmetics bear doll and porcelain tarte
rainforest of the sea in porcelain an
urban decay and get Skin Foundation and
0.5 so reading some of the claims ones
before it such as a high definition
I'm wearing mineral foundations the skin
conditioning foundation smooths and
covers imperfections while feeling
weightless and comfortable it's cruelty
free and it does not contain any
artificial colors fragrance or mineral
oil for all skin types shared to medium
buildable coverage natural dewy finish
if you've been enjoying this series
don't forget to give this video a thumbs
up I appreciate it is one through eleven
our link down below in the description
box and a playlist along with the first
two seasons playlist if you are just
joining the burrito fam welcome
everything you need to know / you want
to know ever is down below so if you
want to see what I think of the Kogan
doe aqua foundation and how it applies
somewheres throughout the day you're in
the right place just keep watching it's
actually April 12th when I'm filming
this I just realized 828 in the morning
I'm so curious to try this one out just
because I've heard such good things
about this what the packaging looks like
I like the shape of it it's a little bit
matte very basic glass packaging and
then it has a pump so 1/2 I say so many
is my morphe e30 wine this is my only
semi clean foundation brush right now
and then the Real Techniques miracle
complexion sponge on the other half of
my face where I do wash moisturize and
prime my face use my Laura Mercier
foundation primer let's get started woah
very liquidy looks like a very liquidy
kind of sim consistency so I'm curious
to see how this applies with a sponge
let's start with a brush on this side of
my face on their website it says the
best way to apply this is in thin layers
and build it up a shade is very pink
toned you can kind of see a distinction
on my neck
woah feels super lightweight on that fin
layer with the brush it's not covering a
whole lot at all even my redness is
still coming through right here
definitely light coverage on that first
layer but supposed to be buildable looks
very radiant lately I feel like I've
been preferring the sponge with most
foundations and I think I am on this one
too where I got a little bit better
coverage with a sponge it looks kind of
like a tinted moisturizer right now
definitely light coverage before I add a
second layer just so you can see all of
my stuff is coming through right now it
could be nice if you like that light
coverage when use a sponge for the
second layer since I like how that
applied a little bit better so use about
two and a half pumps so far on my whole
face so it is building I think we're at
about medium coverage now if you're
someone who has asked me you'd probably
just have to spot conceal even on the
second
layer it isn't covering up any of my
acne but it looks nice and thin it
doesn't look like I'm wearing two layers
of foundation it looks really good on
the center of my forehead I always look
for products that sit well right there
because that's one of my problem areas I
can get pretty cakey on the center of my
forehead not the formula or way it looks
on my skin at all but the coverage looks
pretty similar to the Loreal Pro matte
foundation that I reviewed a couple days
ago now that it's on my skin though and
I blended it down my neck I actually
liked it shade before I do the rest of
makeup I am going to spot conceal down
here just a little bit I'll show you
guys because why not typically I use a
concealer that's a little bit darker but
my shape tape is right here it looks
really plump and radiant on my skin I'm
really liking the way that it's sitting
on my skin right now so with that second
layer on here's what my skin is looking
like I think it looks really nice very
smooth it's not clinging anywhere it
looks good on the center of my forehead
around my pores enough I want to powder
my face with this one I'm loving the way
that it's looking on my skin right now
and I feel like if I put on a powder at
my room that and I just powder the
center of my forehead
right now it's 8:40 someone applied the
rest of makeup and I'll be right guys
it's now 9:40 I just totally hit a wall
I actually finished up my makeup around
9 o'clock so that's when we're going to
call the check-in time I've been on for
about 40 minutes now and it looks really
nice I use the cover FX illuminating
setting powder just on the center of my
forehead but I used a really light hand
I didn't want to fully powder my face
because I do love the finish of this and
it looks just like skin right now the
way it looks kind of reminds me of the
Tarte reinforcement the seed foundation
but I can get better coverage with that
Foundation for sure when I use this
foundation again I would definitely spot
conceal all of my acne first and then
just go in with one layer of the
foundations whenever I do reviews on
lighter coverage foundations I try and
just look at the actual products because
obviously I'm someone who likes more
full coverage but just looking at how
it's sitting on my skin if you don't
have a lot to cover up it looks really
nice it looks like skin it's not
emphasizing any weird discs on my face
anywhere right now I have no complaints
I'm gonna tell you guys what's on the
rest of my face to contour my face I use
my ELF eyebrow kit in the shade light I
just go in with this shade right there
to contour her blush / I guess bronzer I
know this product I can kind of use for
both this is a Burberry earthy blush I
tried to melt makeup holographic stick
in the shade supernova and it was like
straight
blue so then I went over it with the Mac
mineralize skinfinish in lightscapade
just kind of toned down the blue I'm not
trying to have a blue highlight on my
face today
so the matte shades use modern
renaissance palette on my eyes and I use
my favorite Stila liquid glitter and
diamond dust I love this thing
pro tip if you're going to use this
definitely put down all of your matte
shadows and use this last this is the
first time I tried to blend my kind of
outer V corner after putting this on and
it totally made the glitter go
everywhere so if you've had issues with
that definitely put on the glitter as a
last step
gara eyeliner on my normals will be down
below then lips I tried out this combo I
use the pur cosmetics liquid lipstick in
the shade up a with wet and wild nudie
patooty think that is everything so
check-in time is 9 o'clock the next
check and I do will be in natural
lighting and I'll see you guys in two
hours
alright this one for T so if foundations
knots are almost 5 hours and I wanted to
do the check-in right now because they
actually just swatch the foundations and
I was washing off the swatches I noticed
on my arm it kind of faded a little bit
now since about 10 minutes ago but on my
arm right
I can't even point to it kind of right
where my crease is right there in my arm
it got really red and splotchy and
that's right where I swatch this coach
endo foundation so I'm hoping I'm not
allergic to it and then I looked in the
mirror and I'm going to zoom you guys in
I'm actually getting some little bumps
ok I think the camera actually is
picking it up if I attempt to be really
still hopefully you can see that but
there's little white bumps all over my
nose obviously around my nose it is not
looking good at all right now and then
also a bit on my forehead it's not super
noticeable but when I get up close and
look in the mirror I can see it if you
were just looking at my face from
farther away you wouldn't be able to
tell as much right now I'm piling a side
is it piling or pilling you know when
your question yourself then you have no
idea a little bumps aside I still like
the way my forehead and skin looks from
far away all this is coming through so
again not for someone who needs more
coverage so it's obviously not wearing
the best on my skin right now but I
don't hate the way it looks so I hope it
doesn't break down more throughout the
day but I will check back in with you
guys at the end of the night ok so it's
now 7:05 so the Foundation's been on for
10 hours I have a new tripod standing
vertical handheld tripod things is
exciting don't have to worry about
covering the mic I think for whatever
reason this one
isn't sitting on my skin very well
pretty much the same thing that happened
with the etude house foundation which I
loved but the pilling I got the little
white dots everywhere that's exactly
what's happening on this one so I'm not
sure if it's one of the ingredients that
maybe is in both of those products but
I'm going to zoom you guys in I think
you guys can see that then around my
nose area just does not look at it all
it's like not sticking to my nose area
at all from far away the center of my
forehead doesn't look bad ish is when
you get up close so you can see little
white dots there as well but from far
away it doesn't look bad if you use this
foundation let me know if this is happen
you or if it's just something that my
skin is doing but if I didn't have those
dots I don't think this one would be bad
at all I think God actually really liked
it gives everything else if you just
look at my skin kind of far away looks
really nice feel like I don't look
overly oily right now it just looks kind
of like a healthy glow even after 10
hours so I'm going to play around with
this one and see if I can make it work
for my skin and I'll update you guys and
wrap a video my thoughts the workout
will do this thing now
tripod weighs like 10 pounds if you guys
enjoyed this video make sure you give it
a thumbs up love you guys thanks for
watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
