on top alright so today it is day 6 of
15 days of foundation this is where we
try out a new foundation every single
day for 15 days I've been switching off
days between drugstore and high ends so
today we have another drugstore
foundation and this is a new release by
la girl this is their Pro matte HG High
Definition long wear matte foundation so
this foundation has 1 fluid ounce
product in it which is standard and it
retails for $8.99 on Ulta but there's
only 8 shades on Ulta if you go on la
girl's website they have all 14 shades
there but it retails for $10 so a buck
more on LA girls website but you might
have to go there if they don't have your
shade on Ulta so reading the claims on
this one it says it's a soft and suede
like finish from a foundation will have
you cover it and shine free all day
I do have normal to dry skin right now I
used to have oily skin I'm on activated
right now it says creamy liquid formula
provides smooth and buildable coverage
minimizes the appearance of pores and
fine lines for an even soft focus effect
it doesn't say the coverage on line but
on the back of the bottle it says medium
to full coverage the packaging is a nice
frosted glass bottle and it does have a
pump to all the high-end brands that
can't afford to do this la girl brands
doing it and it's eight bucks so I
actually have the four lightest shades
here so I'm gonna do swatches of all
these four shades compared to some of my
other foundations and also the LA girl
Pro coverage this first shade right here
is the LA girl Pro matte foundation and
the lightest shade ivory next over is
the same foundation in the shade bisque
beige and then natural so as you can see
the fourth over lightest shade natural
is actually lighter than the second two
shades and the second shade there's a
big difference between these two shades
so it kind of jumps and then the third
shade should probably be like over here
and like this
shade and the second shade has a lot of
orange II almost like peach tones to it
this foundation right here is the la
girl pro coverage foundation in lightest
shade porcelain CYO life proof and 101
derma called 2:08 Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless in 110 so I do really
like the la girl pro coverage foundation
especially as my skin has been more dry
this is a beautiful illuminating dewy
foundation I have a whole other video on
it but I do think that this breaks me
out so I'm hoping that this foundation
doesn't do that I also really like the
white mixer in this line they have a
white mixer that you can mix in to
lighten foundations so I'm curious about
this foundation we'll see how it is how
it wears throughout the day if you're
excited for 15 days foundation and
you've been enjoying don't forget to
give this video a thumbs up link to vote
is down below right at the top of the
description box this eyelash needs to
get in place dude I also wanted to say
very exciting we actually added limited
edition mugs to the page they'll have
already been up by the time you guys are
seeing this but this is the first time I
can like announce it in a video since
the other ones were already recorded a
couple of you guys suggested this so I
brought back two of the old 15 days of
foundation designs that were a limited
edition and those are now on mugs so
100% those proceeds also goes to project
B shares throwback og 15 days foundation
designs are down below wow I really need
to pluck the brows right now can't wait
okay so right now it's 803 in the mornin
I need all the coffee today so I'm ready
wash moisturize prepped my skin I did
really good moisturizing this morning
cuz we're going in with a matte matte
foundation I have been done the swatches
yet but I think ivory is gonna be too
light so I'm gonna go on to the second
lightest shade bisque if it's too dark
or too light I'll mix in another shade
but we're gonna do half my face with my
Sigma f80 flat top and then the other
half with my la girl sponge that sponge
rocks by the way I haven't seen it on
all two yet but I think you can only get
it from our website right now this one
might be dark yeah it looks a little bit
dark
okay so natural the fourth over shade
actually looks much lighter and much
closer to my undertone then Biss does
this one looks a lot more beige toned
yeah we're gonna go in with that one
this one looks definitely more peachy on
the bottle it says medium to full
coverage and it's supposed to be smooth
and buildable
oh that looks a little dark I'm smelling
I used a dr. Bronner's soap on my sponge
this morning and it is scented dr.
Bronner's by the way you can get it at
like Ross or TJ Maxx and stuff best soap
ever to clean your makeup brushes that
shade is dark yeah I don't know if you
guys can see that on camera so bisque is
definitely out of the question I guess
I'll try beige even though this
definitely looks darker the natural in
the bottle the beige is for sure darker
so I guess I want to mix in a little bit
of the lightest shade ivory ivory I
think looks too late yeah I really own
would be too light I think I'm mixing in
a little bit of ivory and with natural
feels very smooth doesn't feel like a
matte foundation usually does okay it
feels very lightweight and thin it feels
super super lightweight whoops
oops okay guess I'm spreading this over
let's go down the neck try the brush
side I'm gonna not build up this side
just do one layer so you can see and
then go in to build it up because I
think something might have happened when
I went to build that up I really like
the consistency of this you're not
putting on like a thick heavy matte
foundation hmm okay weird that's getting
really patchy in certain areas and
almost darkening this is totally mixed
like there's no darker shade that should
be coming out this is weird because it
looks really nice from far away when I'm
looking at my mirror but when I actually
look up close there's some weird stuff
going on I don't know what's happening
with its like certain parts are
oxidizing and it's not looking the best
around here
it's definitely oxidizing I hope this is
gonna pick up on it but right here is
where I'm seeing the weirdness
it's weird even on my forehead there are
certain parts that are just darker
there's definitely some clinging
happening in certain areas I can see in
the viewfinder the shade looks fine but
in real life this is oxidizing so fast
my face looks about too shy to shades to
shades too dark and bit orange not the
best coverage definitely not full
coverage low medium coverage you can
still see everything coming through I'm
not liking this it's weird because I I
like the thinness of it I like how
lightweight it feels and again looking
at it far away it actually looks really
nice it's just there's some weird stuff
going on so I'm gonna try and actually
just use the lightest shade I've read
because this has oxidized so much I
think I'm just gonna try and build this
up with a sponge I don't see a big
difference between brush and sponge side
as far as coverage or finish so I think
I'm just gonna use a sponge and it's
gonna probably look a little bit light
at first but once it oxidizes it should
match oh no man maybe that is my shade
it's not really building as far as
coverage yeah at all
this is oxidizing on my skin like crazy
like it's almost like I put it on and it
instantly darkens you can see how light
that looks right there and watch it'll
darken almost immediately so with that
in mind I think I would be ivory alone
not mix it with anything just
considering what it changes to this one
is interesting man I'm confused by this
one ignore my eyebrows I'm plugging them
tonight very confused it feels nice it
feels lightweight and for a matte
foundation it doesn't seem to look too
heavy or cakey on my skin right now
which is pretty hard to find for a matte
foundation but then when I look up close
it looks wild like I just don't
understand this major patchiness like
there's this thing right here between my
eyebrows that's happening maybe this is
one that will just like totally change
once I do the rest of my makeup and you
won't really be able to tell I haven't
had a foundation oxidize as much in a
while no know if you guys will see this
but there's a line right here even where
I blended down the lightest shade ivory
wouldn't call this full coverage
wouldn't call this buildable I don't
think I got any more coverage on that
second
at all you can still see freckles
scarring things coming through so I
think this one is about medium coverage
to the touch
it feels pretty dry like it doesn't feel
too sticky I do think I could blend
powder products on top of here it is
transferring a bit so right now it's 822
I'm gonna do the rest of my makeup I
have some new things I'm gonna play your
house I'm really excited get some
caffeine in my life it'll be right back
okay so it's now nine oh nine we're
gonna call it check-in time 8:30 since I
was when I finished up with my face
makeup you guys we just have to have a
holy seize here I tried out this
eyeshadow palette two of them these are
new drugstore palettes oh my gosh these
are the new Milani most loved mattes
palettes these bold obsessions in most
love mattes this one's bold obsessions
the gold from this palette unreal that's
what's on my lids right now and then the
matte shades I use these ones Milani
literally knocked it out of the park
with this palette I'm just blown away by
the quality of these shadows anyways
I'll tell you what's on the rest of my
face I just got way too excited let's
talk about the foundation so it didn't
end up setting my face with powder at
all and powder products blend it out
fine on top of it so I like that you
don't have to set this one with powder
and now that the rest of my makeup is on
I like how it looks again it's just very
bizarre I went out and looked at natural
lighting and you can see almost like the
weird discoloration darker and certain
spots lighter in certain spots and again
when I mix the shades they were totally
mixed so I don't think that was it I
think it's just weird like something
weird is going on maybe it's my skin
right now I have no idea but I am
getting weird
discoloration all over there's a little
bit of separation almost on my forehead
where it looks like it's just kind of
sitting on the top right here but
overall the finish and how it looks
looks nice from far away is might be one
that just totally clings and kind of
patches up if you have texture on your
face I just wish the patchy thing wasn't
happening because other than that it
looks pretty good alright let's go do a
little flash test where did I put my
phone here it is and this one does not
have SPF so hopefully this doesn't have
a big flashback
whoa what the heck not expecting that
okay why does my head look super small
first of all with flash it looks about
ten shades lighter so in the rest of my
face we talked about my obsession with
bold obsessions for blush I uses a wave
a gentle touch blush I got this off of
glambot highlighting palette i use this
morphe babe in paradise use this shade
right here these are super soft you
could probably use these as eyeshadows -
the white shade is more like a purple
for contour I use a Smashbox contour
palette this shade right here one of my
favorites lashes are the kiss / guitar
in gala and then lipstick I use Kylie
Mary Jo Kay the necklace I'm wearing
sweater nail polish everything is always
down below in the description box I'll
see you guys in few hours and natural
lighting for the next check-in so it's
no 146 so it's been on for over five
hours and my phone is about to die we're
on five percent right now how does it go
- heard that quickly I peeled off my
lashes though looking a little funky now
but let's take a look I look quite dry I
actually haven't looked at my face yet
looking even happier to me it's almost
looking like splotchy now by the way I
just filmed a empties video so that's
already up that's why I look the same in
that video as I do today I think you
guys can see that it looks pretty
splotchy keeping patchy er than before
and I also look quite a bit drier it did
say that this is oil controlling so I'm
not totally shocked you know obviously
something that's oil controlling isn't
ideal for my skin type right now but if
your oily skin it would probably do a
lot better if I'm only looking at like
the finish of it trying to avoid the
color and stuff doesn't look horrible
horrible dry my forehead has it looks
better it's definitely looking a bit
textured on my forehead like oh man
but yeah even just the finish up it
definitely looks a bit textured dry so
that's where we're at right now five
hours in I'm curious if any of you guys
have tried this yet have experienced the
patchiness I need to
at the empties video edit date two and
day three
lots of editing today so I hope you guys
enjoy what am i doing it is not the end
of the video see you guys at the end of
the night okay so right now it's seven
o'clock so it's been on for over 10
hours at this point ten and a half hours
let's take a look oh and I have lipstick
okay I feel like it has oxidized more so
exact same thoughts as last two
check-ins I think this one I'm just
gonna have to totally try a couple more
times I don't think I've ever had a
foundation like this where I I like it
but there's also some really not great
things going on maybe the layering was
the downfall next time I'm going to try
it with a primer underneath and I'm
gonna try only one layer of the lightest
shade if I'm just looking at the finish
of it it doesn't look particularly bad
on my dry skin which is good that's been
tricky to find I'm over all confused by
this foundation that is like my thoughts
on this so I laughter you guys in the
wrap-up video once I've tried this a
couple different ways I don't have an
ounce of moisture on my face right now
like it is so dry feeling so I think
with this I definitely would use like a
moisturizing setting spray over top for
me my skin feels very dry right now so
with this one we'll see how it goes in
there applet video but if you've tried
this one let me know if this has
happened with you or what you thought of
it down below in the comments and by the
way I always get questions about this
this was just from Costco it's the most
comfy jacket I've ever purchased in my
life I sleep in this literally I think
I'm in this like 20 hours of the day
would recommend over this foundation
spend your money on this Costco jacket I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
did don't forget to give it a thumbs up
if you're excited for a day 7 is
tomorrow day 7 and we really have to go
through this every single morning when I
I just need to start writing this down
but if you're new here don't forget to
join the burrito family and subscribe
every single day is 6 p.m. Pacific time

literally shaking right now I'm so out
of shape probably key that I should wash
