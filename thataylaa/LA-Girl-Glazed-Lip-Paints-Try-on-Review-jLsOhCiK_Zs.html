looks like I'm a rock star addict but
I'm really filming these all in the same
day you know I kind of man so today we
have a review slash Tryon of the brand
new la girl let'slet's here's all of
them these come in six shades in retail
for about three dollars three to four
dollars depending on where you get it I
have a link down below where you can get
the whole collection for like sixteen
dollars I think or 18 somewhere around
there so these are supposed to be a
super intense color with an extra glossy
finish that's what it says on the front
I think la girl is trying to be kind of
like to face melted the packaging is
super similar with the bold cap and will
- I have not tried the Too Faced melted
they're super pigmented go on really
easily they feel nice on the lips they
don't feel super sticky at all but they
do tend to transfer onto your teeth so
I'll probably have red on my teeth in
like two seconds they do have a minty
scent which I really like
I definitely prefer minty sense to like
the fruity shit but if you don't like
that then you probably don't want to try
these up here in my face
the only thing I don't like about these
is the applicator for a gloss that's
supposed to be super pigmented and kind
of like a liquid lipstick this is super
difficult to get in the lines of your
lips you definitely need to use a lip
brush because the top of this is just
too difficult to get in the lines of
your lips at least for me so if you want
to see a demo slash Tryon of each of
these colors then you can just keep
watching
all right literally have about ten
minutes to film this because the Sun is
about to sit if you want to see a
tutorial on the eye like I'm wearing
right now I have a whole get ready with
me video on this look I just changed my
shirt just for the sake of I don't know
felt like it so I'm going to start out
with the pink ones in the collection
start out with baby doll
feel like nicki minaj right now this is
like a total shan EXO pink color is this
one of the ones that goes on really
easily like I had no issues applying
that one some of them are a little bit
more difficult but this one is fine no
problems here so there we go that is
baby doll the next pink shade I'm going
to apply is a bombshell this one is a
little bit darker and more magenta
that's where dad's gone before
this is the point where they're hard to
apply because I wanted to get just a
little bit out and if you get too much
and then it gets all blobby so there is
baby doll or what is this bombshell like
this is a super pretty kind of fuchsia
color for summer obviously and not with
eyes like these but just with the
neutral eye and some blush I feel like
this would be really pretty more of a
cool tone magenta which I prefer
definitely sat with my roommate for like
20 minutes trying to explain what cool
tones are so the next shade I actually
used in a get ready with me shadow and
schmooze video this is in the shade
blushing
super-pretty a moth color I'm just
applying these superfast right now but
normally I would use a lip brush to
apply it because like you can see it is
kind of difficult to get in the lines of
your lips with this kind of applicator
so then we have this orange a shade
called hot mess
I am never a fan of orange lips I just
can't do it it just doesn't work I don't
know if it's my fair skin or what but
not a fan but I already want to take it
off
this would definitely look much better
on someone who has a tan going on or
something again hot mess that is what I
feel like right now next is probably my
favorite shade from the collection this
is the shade koi and it is a purple
color obviously it's my favorite pink go
wrong with purple lips and this is like
a true purple like this is Barney purple
right here you ever think about the guy
who actually plays Barney like what is
he doing right now
so here's koi this is like I said my
favorite ones cool toned purple really
bright really fun I like it what do you
guys think of koi also once you leave
them on for a little bit you definitely
still feel the mint eating leanness
which I really like and then the last
shade we're trying on is pinup I like
the name of this one but look how
pigmented these are it's actually kind
of insane so here's pinup just a classic
red definitely gets on your teeth super
easy so that was all six of the brand
new la girl glazed lip paints if you
liked this video be sure to give it a
thumbs up so I know like I said I have a
link down below where you can find them
