here it's actually the day before I
leave for LA so it's Tuesday today I
leave for LA Wednesday have a couple
days we're doing like the project view
share thing with the shelter on Friday
and then the meetup is Saturday and that
Sunday I head back to Seattle just in
case you needed to know my entire LA
schedule but it is 1:30 right now and
actually have a nail appointment because
these are looking a little bit tragic
this morning I've just been editing I've
got two weeks worth of videos pre-filmed
which is awesome because literally the
day after I get home from LA my mom and
my grandma from North Carolina are
visiting here for a whole week so I got
that week you saw at the videos
pre-recorded too so I have just two more
to edit so I've just been editing a
shit-ton lately just I can schedule all
those okay dirty mare I still need to
clean where Snoopy's nose was but here's
my outfit for the day these jeans are
from American Eagle and I just rolled
them up and then these shoes are Nike I
don't know what style they are but if I
can find him I'll link them down below I
feel like they were kids are these kids
alone I can't remember I just have on
like a high-neck tank top I think this
was from Old Navy wow this mirror is
needing some cleaning and then this long
sweater it has like two pockets right
here this was from Kohl's I think so
here are my finished nails they look so
nice I'm in love I did like a grey they
have three free gels and we put the
chrome tips on so nails are done in that
salon was so freaking cute can I move in
so thank you Tony
at Juniper nail salon and Ballard
I'm obsessed I'm obsessed shout out to
my fake adidas workout t-shirt that I
got in Jordan like five years ago for
like five dollars still going strong all
of that needs to be folded I'm about to
do some Jillian Michaels right here
so figured I would show you guys what it
picked up during the Sephora vib sale
actually plays two separate orders
because you know and you think you're
gonna do good and only get a couple
things and then you get a little wild
that's what happened just got this order
in today but these ones I've been trying
for about a week now so picked up the
summer Friday's mask because I've heard
so many people rave about this it's the
jet lag mask and you basically use this
as like an eye cream an overnight kind
of mask a moisturizer underneath makeup
a ten-minute mask whatever you want
I've used this about five times now and
I literally haven't seen the difference
at all I've tried it as an overnight
kind of thing I've use it in different
ways and I don't even feel like it
really moisturizes my face that well so
I don't know it seems like it's getting
kind of mixed reviews on Sephora I
picked up this because again I've heard
rave things about this so this is the
Bobby Brown vitamin enriched face break
brace face this thing is friggin pricey
I think this was like 80 or 90 bucks so
pricey so I wanted to pick it up during
the sale I'm gonna give it a go try it
out I've used this a couple times now
underneath makeup it's basically just
like kind of a thicker cream but when
you put it on it doesn't feel super
thick on the skin so far I'm not
obsessed or anything but I'm gonna keep
using it and see what I think of it
especially underneath makeup I picked up
this guy Oh what the heck wait what
that's the floor of what's going on here
bro now there's not even flaps on this
side so that's interesting but this is
the dr. jart ceramide in cream heard
really good things about this on the
reviews on Sephora this is the halo
hydrating perfecting powder these are
the way repairing conditioner and then
the repairing shampoo and I'm usually
like a drugstore shampoo kind of gal but
wanted to give this a try ooh cool top
you'll smell it know how I feel about
that smell see how it is when I'm using
it in the shower
all right so I made it to LA I've
actually been here for a day now but I
was in Venice staying at my uncle's
house for a day and just hanging out
with them and stuff I didn't vlog or
anything that because I was just
enjoying some family time but I made it
to the Airbnb and it is freaking unreal
I'm gonna give you guys a tour but check
out oh oh my gosh this patio haven't
even gone out here yet oh my god so
frigging currents in downtown LA I love
Airbnb I feel like it's the best way to
stay it's a loft in downtown LA good
location everything and I'm gonna link
it down below and I think Airbnb I have
a code where you can get I want to say
it's $20 off your first Airbnb or
something I'll have everything down
below but look how it's looking
beautifully this is decorated here's the
kitchen this is like a speed Airbnb tour
right now giant mirror
well the huge mirror I feel like you
can't even tell how huge it is I'm doing
this like backwards but here's where you
walk in this is what you see and then
here is the bedroom I mean here's the
bathroom we've got some nice little
white marble there and I'm saying let's
go out on this balcony shall we
so excited to see the skill
so freakin cool
I cannot wait to just chill and like
take a nap in this but tonight it's
Thursday tonight's my kind of chill
night and then tomorrow all the
shenanigans begin so tomorrow we're
meeting the Good Shepherd Center by the
way I guess for those of you who don't
know I'm here
for the whole project pshare event

dollars during the beauty wishes
campaign during 15 days foundation so
tomorrow we're giving the five thousand
dollar check to the Good Shepherd Center
the LA shelter that one and then my
parents come in tomorrow my parents are
gonna be at the meet up and tomorrow
we're also doing a dinner with Raju
Pierre my parents are gonna come to that
and then Saturday is the meet up in
branwall so super excited I cannot wait
to meet you guys I hope people show up I
always have this like fear with meetups
that no one's gonna come but I know it's
always kind of scary doing meetups the
sun's out it's like 70 degrees feeling
good I just want to like post meet
something tonight do a face mask chill
as opposed to old thing on Instagram
stories of what my travel skincare
routine entails these are the best

my friggin favorite why is this ad like
frozen right now so i just got my coffee

look at how crazy this is though you can
like see everything
it's creepy probably
I'm like getting ready in phases right
now and I don't like to do the top of my
hair until after I do my foundation
stuff just I don't have to worry about
clipping back my hair but I'm gonna put
on some I've been obsessed with this
stuff pretty sure raves and rejects will
be up before this video goes up but this
stuff is awesome for just a super like
low maintenance gradual why is this
something such as she's focusing
tomorrow for the meetup I'm pretty sure
I'm wearing shorts so I'm gonna do this
one more time today so I'll be good for
tomorrow it's super like what do you see
I could be careful cuz it like runs out
but it dries hella fast you don't have
to like shave or anything I mean I've
shaved a couple days ago but I didn't
like exfoliate my legs doesn't look
streaky or anything and it dries
literally in about five or ten minutes
you can put on clothes afterwards I'll
link it down below but I just get it on
Sephora alright so I am ready to head
out this is what I'm wearing keeping it
cashmere t-shirts and like jeans these
shoes are some of my favorite like
casual comfy ones that still look a
little bit nice these are by VSP key I
got them off a hot look where I get old
my shoes I'll link all up down below but
it's like a flash sale site by Nordstrom
they have size fours if you have small
feet too but these jeans are the black
ripped jeans I always wear from Topshop
this shirt is TJ Maxx and say this
jacket was also TJ Maxx or Target
nothing was TJ Maxx here's my makeup for
the day I'm not wearing false lashes or
anything just so my eyes don't want her
like crazy but my foundation I'm wearing
is the Vichy that I just did for a
foundation Friday mixed in with CYO life
Griffin 101 and it's much better of a
shade and so far I like it I sprayed it
with the makeup forever setting spray
which helped a lot my lips is Sephora
liquid lipstick in the shade 33 and then
my eye shadow is the jaclyn hill morphe
palette with the Smashbox trio like the
topi one I always use yeah my highlight
is my Drake at highlight that I love the
loose one the pearl Luminizer we have
Sun so I'm about to catch an uber over
there I still haven't sat in this chair
over there
so project you to share we collect
gently used personal hygiene and
cosmetics for women in shelters that are
dealing with homelessness addiction and
mess
we start off with animal shelters we're
now at 30 shelters to suppose nanan
Eastern Washington and we actually now
get a lot of brand-new products so one
of the things that thanks to Taylor we
end up getting the attention of some
exceptional and national brands like
Tampax and Maybelline Garnier and Prive
and elf cosmetics and there's a handful
of others so when these big companies go
through rebranding or you know different
things happen with packaging or with
their warehouses in the past I'm not
sure what they do with those things but
once they discovered project Beauty
shared they started sending those items
to what also thanks to Taylor our donor
base we used to have probably about 25
different states that were contributing
project leaders shared through social
media thanks to Taylor we now have
donations from all 50 states as well as
about 13 countries around the world and
so she's taken her celebrity and turned
it into something that's incredible and
influence over the people that followed
her has brought so much to project being
shared and so that's kind of to see to
where we're at today and where we stand
today because we have all these national
brands supporting us our shelters have
as much as they could use and so we
wanted to do something to pay it forward
we wanted all the people there
supporting Taylor supporting project
baby share across the United States to
know that we're sharing the love and so
thanks to sharon robertson our
development director she went out to did
an exhaustive search of shelters across
the United States and we chose Miami
Houston New York Chicago and LA
we want to target and you guys here in
LA and then thank you Alice and Ross
Kelly who's on the board here and who's
our social media marketing guru and he
works for an amazing company has great
resources and great expertise if they
worked with Taylor to build a floating
platform and reason to launch this on
social media and I think between the
five shelters we had over 35,000 people
engage around different wattages we're
very excited I think you take that over
11,000 votes you guys came out as the
winners wanted to do for you and thank
you but I can walk famous yeah we have
referrals for the women so if they're
looking for work if they just moved in
and they don't have any clothes they can
come in and they can get clothes for
themselves and for their children I
think it's really cool for people to see
where the money goes and stuff so what
do you guys think out of the $5,000 like
do you have any kind of idea of where
that might be going or what does e is
for probably gonna go into the Family
Services program mean bad program is
strictly private funded so it's very
flexible we're going to make sure that
it goes straight to the families that we
serve at Farley house that they can you
know go out in the community and feel
like a family because they've lost that
you know through their journey of
homelessness so that's what we're going
to do with the donation
so if people locally who live in LA want
to get involved what's the best way that
you can get involved with Good Shepherd
Center and someone else mentioned that
food donations are the most important
would you say thank you so much
we have a donut delivery remember the
one and only location tell me your
original idea Stan found this giant
mirror uh-huh whoo and wait that's just

wrong way this way cool look
