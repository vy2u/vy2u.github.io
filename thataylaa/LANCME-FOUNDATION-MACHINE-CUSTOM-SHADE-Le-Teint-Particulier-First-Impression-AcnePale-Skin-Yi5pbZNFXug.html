days of foundation what the heck
feels like it's still day 4 this is
where I try out a new foundation every
single day for 15 days days one through
eight our link down below in the
playlist I am so freaking excited for
this foundation I could not sleep last
night felt like Christmas so this is the
Lancome
Ladon particularly a so say it one more
time I've been saying liptint adult
ultra for like three years so step up
this is the beautiful box I have here it
is so soft love a good soft box and
here's the star of the show so basically
in 2015 a couple years ago Lancome came
out with this custom foundation machine
which basically scans your face and then
is supposed to come out with your exact
perfect foundation shade how amazing
does that sound by the way this is not
sponsored by Lancome I paid for this
product myself so I'm going to kind of
talk through /blog this one because I
got a lot of vlog footage of the actual
experience getting it done I did a whole
video on a similar kind of concept for a
drugstore foundation the covergirl
custom foundation so I'm going to put
that over here if you missed that one so
that one was basically where you use an
app to take a photo it scans your face
and they customize your foundation so
watch the video it's probably going to
be a longer video because I have a ton
of information tell you guys grab your
burritos grab your coffee let's do this
the Seattle is actually one of the first
two stores that they launched us with
back in 2015 I don't know how I never
heard of this but it wasn't until this
year when the BuzzFeed video went
completely viral on Facebook which all
of you guys have probably seen it
completely went viral and that's kind of
when this product got picked back up
again and people started talking about
it you can actually only get this done
at 11 different locations in the US I'll
leave a link down below on their website
where it shows you which ones
so Lancome bots au key technology and on
their website it says it's the most
sophisticated and unique service in
cosmetics protect against oxidation and
maintain color accuracy the custom-made
technology is equipped with eight
peristaltic heart pumps for an airtight
blending and dispensing process the
innovative technology allows for
customized coverage finish and
moisturizing and of course shade I want
to point out that in Sephora yes you can
use their system to find your perfect
shade
what dad's doing is choosing from
already existing foundations in the
store so your pick for your perfect
shade is going to be from a lot smaller
of a pool this literally can make over
20,000 shades so I'm just going to read
the claims off the website really
quickly and then we'll jump into more
about what I think you guys will be
wondering so as I say micro fill
technology infuses a weightless liquid
foundation with high impact pigments
that glide on easily to flatter and
hydrate meticulously blended with
neutral and natural undertones to create
an ultra flawless finish that's like
second skin long wearing a breathable
oil free paraben free fragrance free
formula safe for sensitive complexions
so I actually really like that it's
fragrance free because a lot of high-end
foundations have such an intense floral
scent you know what I'm talking about
that's all it says on the lancome
website to get this entire process done
and to walk out of the store with your
foundation it costs $80 actually don't
get a full fluid ounce of progress you
get 0.7 fluid ounces obviously that is
very expensive for a foundation I think
this is the most I've ever paid for a
foundation but keep in mind that you are
paying for the technology and experience
the whole process as well it's basically
like a consultation and you're creating
your own foundation
so basically you book an appointment go
into your lancome counter you take off
all of your makeup and then they use
this scanning device to pick three spots
on your face neck or shoulders or
basically anywhere she explained that
you could do anywhere on your body that
you wanted to match the color to for me
since I have acne and I have a lot of
redness and stuff it was kind of
difficult for us to find a neutral area
on my face if you're someone who has
lots of freckles and you can actually
get a spot big enough on your face to
match the color to there might be a spot
on your body maybe on your chest or like
the back of your neck where it doesn't
get as much Sun we could grab that scan
from once you do that you get your
custom complexion ID number which is
also printed on the outside of here this
stays in their system and this basically
pulls up the screen on the computer
where it tells you your undertone it
tells you how much yellow white red
black they're putting in your formula so
here's the screen that you get after
yours
skins or you're pretty neutral a little
bit more on the neutral cool side
because you do have a little bit of pink
in your skin and then so this is showing
that that's kind of what we get yellow
that's going to go in there mostly white
I totally understand
remotely I have a 91 white yeah I think
this is how much moisturizer is going in
there and we have known for that are
going in there because we're doing a
full coverage honestly the coolest part
of this for me was seeing my exact
undertone I feel like my skin has
changed over the years and I used to be
very cool toned and just in the last
year I think I'm much more neutral and
this kind of confirmed that I'm
definitely more neutral cool and I also
had a bit of yellow in there I feel like
getting confirmation I guess on what my
undertone really is was the coolest part
for me I think this is also where you
can choose if you have dry skin normal
skin or oily skin I actually heard and
the girl at the counter confirmed that
the oily skin version is not the best so
even though I have combo oily skin I
went with the normal skin version not
supposed to be a lot better and here you
can also choose the coverage that you
want being someone that has acne and a
lot to cover up I typically like full
coverage foundations so I chose full
coverage I'm just going to tell you guys
off the bat this is not full coverage
nowhere near full coverage barely medium
coverage you'll see in the demo but that
was a huge downside to me if this is
going to be a custom foundation where
you're supposed to be able to completely
customize it why not make the full
coverage actually full coverage this
isn't even me comparing it to like derma
Col or Marc Jacobs this is like it is
not basic full coverage I think that's a
major miss on their part because
coverage is one of the things that you
do look for in a foundation so once you
select all that you can kind of tweak it
there or you can also tweak it one more
time so if you know you like more pink
in your foundation or you like it a
little bit lighter or darker you can
tell them then and they can adjust it on
the screen or once the first batch is
made they can also adjust it after that
then the crazy machine thing happens the
foundation comes out then it's put into
this shaker once a shaker goes that's
what really mixes up all the pigments
and that process only took about five to
ten minutes for the shaker when it's out
of the shaker that's when you get to
test out the foundation for the first
time so when we first put it on it's
always difficult to see in the lighting
in those counters I walked over to a few
different mirrors
and the shade was definitely too dark
Maddy and my friend who was helping me
film camera one and she also thought it
looked too dark I want to make a
nickname lighter
oh I thought when you were putting it on
it looks a little dark looking on camera
but it in person it looks are quick I
can see the tags looks are that's where
you can adjust it we're kind of deciding
whether I should go one or two shades
lighter I just went with one shade you
guys you'll see in the demo but I'm kind
of regretting not going with two shades
lighter then she put it back into the
machine made it a little bit lighter it
came out she plopped a label on it put
it in the packaging and here we go it's
always tricky because I think you know
how you like to apply your foundation
best so it's hard to judge a product
based on the initial application at a
counter I just kind of had that in mind
as I was getting it done they say that
the best application is with their brush
that it was made for that brush was not
my cup of tea it's a very flimsy brush
you're definitely going to get light
coverage with it this was yesterday when
I went to the Lancome counter last night
today when I'm filming this is the first
day that I've full-on put it on you guys
will see what I think of it and how it
applies but in this store
as someone who has acne it definitely
looked pretty light coverage we had to
use a lot of concealer on top to cover
up any of my acne and just give a little
bit more coverage and also a powder say
you need a refill for this or you're
going to be a couple shades darker in
the summer and you know that even if you
don't live in the area where you got it
done you can actually call up the
counter that has it is they have your
complexion ID in the system so they can
just adjust it darker or lighter on the
screens and then mail you out a new
foundation you have to travel to the
place that you got it done again the
thing that I do not like about that is
that to get a refill you basically have
to purchase this entire foundation again
you can't reuse the packaging it's $80
again there's not a discounted price for
the refill which I just think is a
little bit ridiculous if you're paying
for the experience and Technology the
first time around and they don't have to
do any of that work again literally just
takes basically 20 minutes to develop
your foundation again since they already
have all the information in the computer
Wisie $80 again I guess it would be
worth it if you found finally your Holy
Grail perfect foundation shade and
foundation formula for me I definitely
would not spend $80 again on the refill
for multiple reasons that you guys will
see I do like the whole experience I
think the experience was really
different and fun I like the packaging
on the box
glad they went with kind of more
minimalistic packaging black white gold
it looks a little bit less outdated than
some other Lancome packaging so I think
I just touched on everything I wanted to
I'm going to serve swatches of my custom
foundation shade compared to some of my
other closest foundation shade matches
just so we can see how it compares okay
so it's watch time right here's Lancome
foundation in my custom shade next over
is derma called 2:08 which I would say
is probably my closest shade match in
any foundation next over is clear
cosmetics paired all in porcelain which
looks totally different than derma call
and it looks like it would be way too
orange but for some reason this shade
works once it's on my skin the Lancome
shade almost looks like if these two
shades had a baby so I guess that makes
sense
x overs chart rainforest of the sea in
the shade porcelain and then Urban Decay
Naked Skin Foundation in 0.5 I have
reviews on all these foundations if
you've been enjoying 14 days of
foundation don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up if you want to see
what I think of the flattened
particularly a foundation in the right
place just keep watching all right so I
am so curious and excited to try this
out and see what I think of it applying
it to myself it's pretty light there's
not a whole lot of weight to it the pump
feels nice but everything else feels a
little bit cheap II plasticky to me I've
already washed moisturizing primary
Pacey's my Laura Mercier primer like
normal in stores she said it applies
better with a foundation brush but I'm
still going to try half my face with my
Real Techniques sponge just to see so
here we go to the dollar pump right here
so I'm going to start with about a dime
sized amount morphe e 31 brush on this
side of my face it has kind of a gel
feel to it to me feels lightweight
but it feels super moisturizing and I'm
kind of thinking we should have gone
with two shades lighter and the
viewfinder you definitely can't tell as
much but in real life
tiny bit dark still I would say maybe
half a shade to a shade I wouldn't say
this is a perfect match to my neck or
chest we already altered it one time
from the machine reading so if I wanted
it to be even closer to my skin tone I
think it would have actually been two
shades off since it is a bit more
moisturizing it's not clinging anywhere
right now
definitely not full coverage you can
still see a lot coming through I'm going
to get up close after I do the sides
with a sponge it just basically evened
out my skin tone on this half I used
about a pump in
a half already on half my face thank you
I would say highlight to low medium
coverage with a brush and I used a
decent amount of product definitely more
than what was put on my face in the
store the first go through so let's
going with a sponge on the other side
see if there's any difference so like
I'm actually getting better coverage
with a sponge right now yeah I think I
got better coverage on the side try the
forehead it is supposed to be buildable
so I'm definitely going to go in with
the second layer I don't know it still
looks like highlight coverage to me on
this side but maybe a tiny bit more on
the get up close so freckles coming
through asking me you can still see it
didn't cover up any of this acne I did
bring it all the way down but yes even
though I don't have a whole lot to cover
up on this side right now you can still
see whoops my mic was light over there
you can still see in my discoloration
and stuff coming through and even on my
forehead where I really don't have a
whole lot to cover up just looks more
like light coverage to me than anything
sitting a little bit dry on certain
parts and I actually noticed that in the
store yesterday
but I thought it was maybe the skin care
and everything that she used underneath
but when I look really up-close yeah
it's actually looking a little bit dry
on certain parts which is interesting
okay so I'm going to go in with now a
third pump for the second layer I'm
going to use a sponge since I do like
how actually just blend apply it a
little bit better see if we can build
this guy up it dries pretty quick oh
definitely work in sections with this
one building as in I'm getting more
coverage but it's actually getting a bit
patchy yeah this is weird it's kind of
clinging to certain areas more than
others I'm gonna actually go grab my
vlog camera before I put on the rest of
my makeup and zoom you guys in and
natural lighting so you can really see
what I'm talking about because there's
some interesting things going on right
now but what's going on the other side
for a second layer not looking ooh
not looking good on my nose whoa okay
this is looking pretty bad guys this is
how it looks yesterday I remember
walking away and thinking my face looked
a bit dry on the second layer it just is
looking like medium coverage now this
looks pretty bad all right I'm going to
go grab the vlog camera so you guys can
see but
right now it's 9:15 so it's pretty
gloomy out today in Seattle so there's
not actually a whole lot of light coming
through right here I think you can even
see the shade here's where it kind of
stops
I think the shade is a little bit off
and being hypercritical because that's
what this whole foundation is supposed
to be your perfect shade I'm going to
really zoom you guys in because what is
going on my face right now so hopefully
you can see this basically have a giant
patch a foundation where it just kind of
clinged on to right they're not covering
any of this it looks dry around this
area and then my nose just looks pretty
horrible like what is going on down here
it basically didn't stick or blend out
at all and I really tried to smooth it
out with my sponge and the brush I have
redness coming through right here looks
like it's kind of gathering around here
and then again on the center my forehead
doesn't look as bad but I yeah like you
can see that sitting on my skin pretty
dry I'm really glad I didn't get the
oily version because I can't even
imagine how that would sit on my skin at
the moisturizing version is looking like
this yeah I think this speaks for itself
I probably should powder my face but I'm
worried that I'm going to look like a
freaking desert if I do that I might use
my cosmetics powder Isis now 1004 I'm
going to call the check-in time 9:30
since that's about when I finished up my
face makeup so I ended up setting my
face because by the time I put my
concealer on looking like a hot mess
powder I use a cosmetic celebration
foundation illumination I love this to
set my foundation this does give you
some coverage and it gives you a glow
and this made my face look five thousand
times better right now out this powder
on top right now it would be bad with
the powder on top it looks like I'm
wearing a different foundation it
totally helped to smooth out and just
give more life to my skin over the dry
patches and can you see the patchiness
anymore does look a bit heavy around my
nose area under us my face I use a body
shop zero one bronzer I love those
things
wet and while just rose a champagne I
also use a new Wet n Wild mega glow
highlighting powder in the sweetest
bling and this was super pretty it's
like a pinky kind of highlight I tried
out a couple things from model Zone
which is a UK brand but they're caring
and IOLTA now this is the vintage Rose I
shadow palette who this mirror goes all
the way back small things in life I've
used a few of the matte shades out of
here and then went in with the pure
cosmetics eye polish in the shade caviar
these are awesome if you never tried
these I've been using this for years
false lashes was pure bombshell again
obsessed and then my lips is over
Cosmetics nude potion this is the
nikkietutorials liquid lipstick so 9/3
you check in next checking ID will be in
natural lighting and i'll see you guys
in all right so it's now 3:18 in the
afternoon so the foundations go on for a
little over six hours I just got such a
cool email I'm so excited
Mae it's going to be fricking crazy man
China Portland and then this thing
looking at the foundation it just looks
very not good it just doesn't look good
I was in Yunnan it looks very foundation
a very textured I literally just tried
to touch my face daughter focus looks
into the camera so I think it's picking
up a bit the texture on here I'm getting
some creasing on my upper lip I think
the nose area is my biggest thing like
it just looks pretty bad even with the
powder on top definitely better than
without the powder like I said without
the powder this would be a complete
disaster right now my forehead doesn't
look bad it just doesn't look the best
in my opinion looks a little bit dry you
can just see the makeup on my skin I
feel like you guys know how I feel about
the actual Lancome foundation at this
point but I'm going to keep this on
throughout the night just to see if I do
get really oily or what Oh pulls the
falsies off by the way so I'll check
back in with you guys at the end of the
night okay so it's not 746 the
Foundation's been on for a little over
ten hours and I'm not oily which is good
I'm not that way at all for ten hours so
I do think it's controlled my oil pretty
well but I feel like you guys kind of
know how I feel about it so at this
point I don't see myself wearing this
again at all probably said the 500 times
now but with the powder on it is mild
better than what it looked like without
the powder I would have not gone outside
with just that foundation on I have seen
people who love the formula this so this
could just be one that totally did not
work for me and that might work for you
like I say with every single product
something that works for me and that I
love might be the opposite for you and
vice versa
this is always just my opinion in my
experience with a certain product it
doesn't mean as a horrible product isn't
you might not like it so with that being
said for me this one is a major no I
mean I think you guys can see from
application just how patchy and bizarre
it got and just dry I wasn't really
expecting it to look dry especially
since I got the version with the
moisturizer in it and it started actual
shade matching technology for me
foundation on its own was a little bit
off with the shades but I couldn't my
fault that could have been where we
chose to take sample from maybe if you
don't have acne and stuff on your face
will probably be easier to get an exact
shade match so I kind of want to try out
the match coat I've heard about the mask
Oh Foundation let me know if you guys
would want to that that's also a custom
Foundation app so I hope you guys enjoy
