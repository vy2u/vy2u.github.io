all right so today it is day 14 of 15
days of foundation one more day left we
got this if you missed any of the
previous days they're all linked down
below and 15a is a foundation playlist
everything down there always so today
we're going to be talking about the
Lancome tin adult ultra cushion
foundation this is a pretty new product
it came out in August I've gotta say the
thing I'm most excited about about this
product is that it comes in 17 shades
which is extremely rare for a cushion
foundation cushion foundations usually
come in like five shades that's on a
good day so the fact that this has 17
shades and it looks like it does go
pretty deep is awesome Thank You Lancome
Lancome our Lancome Lancome sounds too
fancy for me alright so watch time so
the cushions were a tiny bit hard to
swatch but hopefully you can tell this
is the Lancome tonight'll ultra and zero
nine zero this is it in 1 4 0 this is
the Lancome 10 idol ultra liquid
foundation in zero nine zero maybelline
fit me matte and poreless 110 Kat Von D
lock-it
L 42 and urban decay naked and 0.5 so
brace yourselves this retails for 47
dollars which i think is the most
expensive cushion foundation I have
definitely it's probably one of the most
expensive I've seen I know why sell is
coming out with the cushion foundation
let me know if you want to see that when
they come out with it you get zero point
four or five ounces of product which is
kind of standard for cushions Jacob has
0.46 typically with cushion foundations
they have refills where instead of
buying the entire packaging again you
just get the little refill pack thing
whenever you run out Lancome does do
that with this product but the refill is
$39 which I just feel like that is super
pricey
I wish they made the refill about $10
cheaper let's read some of the claims on
here it says it's an oil free high
coverage long wearing liquid foundation
and a portable cushion compact it's an
ultra innovative cushion foundation that
gives you buildable full coverage and
refreshing hydration that lasts unlike a
sponge cushion the ultra absorbent fiber
network was specifically crafted to lock
in high coverage textures so I do
don't really know how exactly that would
work how it locks in high coverage
textures but the cushion I noticed is
definitely different than other cushion
products it's this like I don't know how
to describe it it's almost like a mesh
it's pretty hard it's like not a normal
sponge thing I've never seen it before I
actually thought it was a sealing and
tried to peel it off at first the result
is a lightweight hydrating formula with
a natural-looking matte finish that is
all the claims on this product is just
so satisfying to hold if you're liking
this series make sure you give this
video a thumbs up so I know if you're
new here you can join the bay radio
family and subscribe I upload three
times a week pretty much foundation
Fridays on Friday if you want to see how
its Lancome cushion apply some are
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching all right so I
have already washed moisturize primed my
face I use my usual
anti blemish matte primer there's been a
day in between when I filmed the last
video and today and I feel like my spots
are starting to heal up where I was
breaking out so I stopped using the Olay
Henriksen African red tea cleanser so I
think it was actually that that was
breaking me out could have also been the
LA girl foundation that I did a few days
ago the video on maybe a combo of the
two who knows so when you get this
product it comes in a box inside the box
there's this compact black and gold
super pretty right up my alley and the
actual cushion comes in a little plastic
thing so it's not getting any air in it
or anything and most cushions have this
seal over the top of the cushion that
you peel off before use it this one
doesn't actually have a seal it's just
in this little thing so once you take it
out of there you just pop it in this
little compact I love the all-black
packaging on the inside
super easy you'll hear it kind of click
once it's in there and I actually tried
to peel off this thing because I thought
it was the protective seal or whatever
but this is actually the cushion right
here so have the shade zero nine zero
and one four zero here I feel like we're
kind of used to tossing the little
applicators that come in products with
arts and powders or cream products or
whatever but with cushion foundations
these things really are typically the
best way to apply them but for the sake
of the video we will try it with a real
techniques sponge with fish and
foundations you're supposed to kind of
Pat and roll about people in past videos
say I don't
that I do I just kind of like do it fast
so I know patent troll how you patent
trolls let's start with zero nine zero
ton of product comes out when you do
that smells very perfumed almost a
little bit alcohol you - it's kind of
like project just keeps coming off so
I'm just going to keep going on my
forehead eyelash glue lovely this is
supposed to be buildable - full coverage
and I actually think the shade zero nine
zero is perfect so one little dip and
the sponge thing actually covered half
my face doesn't look like a ton of
coverage right now probably about low
medium coverage but I'm definitely going
to go in with the second layer with this
one because it is supposed to be
buildable to full I love using cushion
foundations when you just need to run
out of the door really fast the Mesha
magic em cushion foundation I did or if
you on a while ago is still one of my
favorites I also really like the jcat
one that I did a foundation Friday on ok
oh
totally forgot to use a sponge whoops
yeah let's try sponge on one half of my
face for the second layer we're going to
do that so I'm dipping my sponge
straight into there yeah a little bit of
product goes a really far away
I think it's faster to apply with a
sponge over the thing it comes with but
that added coverage but we're still not
- full coverage I think we're at solid
medium coverage now let's see how the
second layer looks with this thing it
does look very nice on the skin look
super luminous and healthy which cushion
foundations typically do I like the
coverage like I feel like it's enough
coverage for me but you can still see my
skin coming through I think if you just
spa can see a little bit my scar I next
time first I could probably be fine with
one layer it does feel like it's
starting to set a little bit I don't
think I like a scent kind of smells like
a baby wipe with cushions you always
want to make sure you snap it closed so
there's no air getting in there and
drying it out so here's what it's
looking like a closed super pretty and
glow
we looks very healthy and just kind of
like skin I don't see it clinging
anywhere on my face it just looks super
nice and smooth and glowy's so right now
it's looking good I will be setting this
with the powder I think I almost always
set cushion foundations or else they
usually like slide around a little bit
it's 7:59 so we're calling the check and
time eight o'clock
I'm going to do the rest my makeup and
I'll be right back okay so it's now 8:30
so the rest of my makeup is on and I did
end up setting this one with a powder I
used my laura geller double taped fake
double double take baked versatile
powder foundation in porcelain is one of
my favourite powder is to set foundation
with it looks totally fine and good but
this isn't one of those products where I
feel like the dew and the globe kind of
comes through powder the thing I really
like about the jcat is that it that's
what happens and it just kind of looks
like glowy skin even after you set it
with a powder this one didn't really do
that it kind of just totally modified
does it's supposed to be a natural matte
finish so that could be why it kind of
modified with the powder and that's kind
of cool to have a cushion foundation
that actually has a matte finish if
you're into that I typically like more
satin dewy products but I can be down
for a good matte cushion every once in a
while blush bronzer highlight blended
out totally fine on top I think right
now it's looking good so I'm rest my
face use the benefit hoola bronzer with
a little bit of Ulta velvet blush and
some blow over top that's all that's on
my cheeks right now this new color pop
highlighter and strap this is like a
pinky highlight super pretty and I feel
like it helps to just warm up your face
a little bit
I love the color pop super shot cheeks
and this is black on black matte
packaging hell yeah all I use for
eyeshadow is the covergirl Golden's true
Naked palette I think I have a video
using the Roses one a while ago Too
Faced better than sex mascara colour-pop
ultra matte lip in Times Square and this
is the one that came in the little mini
pack thing and they have this frosted
container with black matte packaging
color pop needs to just make this
packaging the permanent packaging let's
start a change.org petition earrings are
rocks box ring bright Anthony's I always
link jewelry t-shirts everything
put it down below in the description box
so again check in times 8 o'clock next
check and I do will be in natural
lighting and I will see you guys in a
few hours all right so it's now 12 54 so
it's been on for pretty much 5 hours at
this point the shade and everything
really looks so different and natural
lighting I'm actually gonna be having a
different filming situation coming soon
and there's natural lighting so get
excited for true to color lighting I
feel like some of you guys think I'm
darker on camera than I really am
because the lighting in my bedroom does
make me look more tan but when I'm
actually out in actual lighting like
here is my neck heel
anyways I just feel like this foundation
shade looks totally different in natural
lighting right now so let's take a look
up close I was just looking at it in the
bathroom lighting and in natural
lighting and it looks really nice I
think still looks pretty dang matte my
forehead looks a tiny bit satin matte
but overall I would say this is pretty
matte my upper lip looks pretty good
around my nose looks good no major
creasing right now I'm liking it I don't
think I have any major complaints I'm
leave this on until the end of the night
I'll check back with you guys then ok so
it's now 6 o'clock so the Foundation's
been on for 10 hours I don't know what
is going on with my under eye concealer
lately maybe my under eyes are just
super drier it's the powder I'm using
right now but what the heck my under
eyes look like horrible right now for
setting with the powder I'm pretty oily
and also the foundation is breaking down
on my forehead a little bit it doesn't
look bad at all actually from far away
it looks pretty good when I just look at
myself in the mirror but when I'm like
really close it doesn't look that great
I think for the first few hours it
looked totally fine was my favorite
thing ever and also didn't look bad at
all I just think for the price point for
this I probably wouldn't recommend it I
think the Misha magic M cushion
foundation and the J cat Beauty cushion
foundation are just as good if not
better but I do think some people will
like this and I do like this one has a
bigger shade range so this might be
worth trying if you have never been able
to find a cushion foundation
your shade does not that wowed by this
i'll try setting it with a different
powder and see if that changes how it
holds up throughout the day but just for
the price it's like yeah if you have dry
skin i think this one actually could
work since it goes on pretty luminous
and it doesn't seem to really cling to
any dry patches or settle in anywhere it
might work for dry skin same with mature
skin if your oily you'll just have to
use a really good setting powder
throughout the day let me know what you
think of this down below i'm kind of on
the fence so that's my thought on the
Lancome cushion if you guys liked this
video make sure you give it a thumbs up
so I know love you guys thanks for
watching
see you tomorrow for the last day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
