fifteen days of foundation this is where
I do a new first impression video every
single day for 15 days if you're new
here definitely go check out the
announcement video is going to talk all
about the series at what's happening
where you can get t-shirts where you can
buy makeup all the proceeds are going to
project a share along with day one if
you missed it which was we Natasha de
Nona just bring them back Jordan begs
right now if you liked abraded wet dog
so today we're gonna be talking all
about the laura geller brand new cover
lock foundation this is supposed to be a
full coverage cream foundation for some
reason when I look at the words cover
lock I just think of a four-leaf clover
let's read some of the claims on altas
website this retails for $38 and you get
one fluid ounce of product it comes in
nine shades as the lightest shade which
is porcelain and their description for
porcelain says doll light complexion
alabaster skin the shade up from that
just says skin is warmer than porcelain
super helpful Thank You flora and then
the deepest shade is called deep and it
says Coco complexion and they also
spelled complexion wrong anyways reading
the description it says create the
smooth even complexion you crave with
true full coverage blends away
discoloration scars and even tattoos so
this is supposed to be like heavy duty
coverage if they can block tattoos dang
so that's all it says basically smooth
full coverage doesn't say what kind of
skin types this is supposed to be for or
the kind of finish it has so I'm going
to search some swatches right here so
you can see how the lightest shade
porcelain compares to some of the other
live shades of foundation that I have
alright so swatch time right here's the
Laura Geller cover lock foundation in
the shade porcelain next over is
Natasha's Nonna foundation X in the
shade 10 which I did during day one
derma Col to 0-8 Tarte rainforest of the
sea in the shade porcelain
maybelline fit me matte and poreless in
110 pur cosmetics bear at all in the
shade porcelain so if you're excited for
this video and for 15 days of foundation
don't forget to give this video a thumbs
up if you're new here you can join the
BAE Rito family and subscribe yeah
that's cool
attempted to savage savage salvage this
braid overnight 10 guys left like a
freakin let me sub already wash
moisturize and prime my face I use my
Laura Mercier foundation primer this is
what I'm using throughout this entire
series this time around I'm really
excited for this one what am I not
excited for foundation well here's the
packaging it's just kind of a kind of
average squeeze tube in my opinion
nothing super exciting about this
packaging at all so on once in my face
I'm going to go on with a brush this is
the Sigma f80 - I usually like this
brush or the elf one for a little bit
thicker kind of cream foundations I just
find that this usually applies the best
we're gonna try that brush and then on
the other side go in with a real
techniques sponge I feel way more weight
today than I did in day one this is
supposed to be full coverage I'm just
going to start with let's see how far it
goes well this smells interesting okay
this has great coverage off the bat
covering really well for the amount of
products that I used when you blend it
out it feels very lightweight doesn't
feel like you're blending on a heavy
kind of cream foundation feels almost a
little bit goofy or airy and a little
bit of this goes a long way this isn't
one of those foundations that you really
have to use a lot to get full coverage
liking how it's looking on my forehead
this is definitely a matte foundation
but it's not clinging anywhere on my
forehead to any of the dry patches and
on my cheek area it looks really nice
and smooth with a brush let's see how it
looks as a sponge I usually use this
amount on one half of my face and I used
half the amount that usually use on
usually you should see really we need
just a tiny bit of project with this
yeah it literally feels like I'm
blending out air right now very
lightweight it's promising folks it's
looking so good on my forehead this is
definitely full coverage I don't need to
go in with a second layer at all covered
kind of my darker acne spots really well
but it does not feel heavy or cakey
whatsoever and it's just sitting on my
skin really nice
has kind of a soft focus effect like a
soft matte finish and I'm shocked at the
amount that I use to cover my entire
face and get this much coverage since I
have a tiny bit of the acne still coming
through down here I'm just going to go
in with a sponge and see if it covers
more just so you can see if this is
buildable I definitely don't need a full
second layer with this at all yeah
doesn't cake up at all it looks really
good
as far as sponge versus brush I think
they applied pretty much exactly the
same the sponge was a bit quicker so
right now it's 757 so we're going to
call the second time eight o'clock
I'm not going to powder my face with
this because I don't think we need to at
all it's drying down to kind of a powder
finish so as you can see all of my acne
down here is covered I feel like it
looks really nice and smooth look at my
forehead I mean I have dry stuff going
on and this is not clinging to anything
looks really good on the forehead so
eight o'clock I'm going to apply the
rest of my makeup and I'll be right back
okay so it's now 8:25 and the rest of my
makeup is on so I didn't powder my face
and it feels like you have a powder on
like everything blended out super easily
on top of it doesn't feel sticky or
anything but I do think it kind of
transfers a little bit when I was just
moving back my bangs it kind of just
totally rubbed off the foundation right
there the only other thing I noticed
right now is that it is settling into a
line up here are decreasing it's not
creasing on my upper lip yet other than
that I think it's looking really good so
on the rest of my face I use the MUA
bronze perfection matte bronzer blush is
the new l'oreal infallible paints blush
palette here I just went in with this
kind of peachy shade right there I
shadow I put the same bronzer into the
crease and then I went in with the BH
Cosmetics foiled eyes eyes hi shadow
palette this house is actually also my
face highlight I went in with these two
shades right here mix them and just used
a really light hand to use it as the
face highlight and then on top of that I
put this deal of glitter in diamond dust
I'm in love with this thing to normal
eyeliner mascara which will be down
below everything I always have on my
face is down below what I'm wearing
jewelry everything I'm literally about
to drop off my hair right now before
lips I went in with the pencil and like
a lipstick right here from the brand
real her this is in the shade lady love
and these were
in my fabfitfun box which I did a hole
in boxing video on I want to wear this
throughout the day I'm super excited
because I'm pretty sure the Canon vlog
camera should be coming today so I
should have that by the next check-in
hopefully but the next check and I do
will be in natural lighting so I'll see
you guys in a few hours all right so
this is my first time using and turning
on ever as a canon g7x to discuss the
marks to it so I'm going to be using for
Check Into now the quality so far looks
working good it also looks much more
true to color than any time I do check
it on my iPhone so this literally just
came in the mail and then I charged it
for ten minutes and now we are here so
I'm hoping I have enough batteries a
second so let's see how the foundation
is looking so it's definitely more dewy
when it's I look oily yet but my
forehead you can definitely see some oil
coming through I'm hoping it doesn't
turn into oil oil by the end of the
night just assume in on this thing look
at that oh hell yeah you can actually
really see you okay it looks like it's
starting to separate on the center of my
forehead to me right there oh by the way
I dive in save the time just look at the
time and it's 1:30 so the Foundation's
been on for five and a half hours
overall I think it looks pretty good
right now
nothing major is going on I just feel
like my forehead doesn't look the
greatest maybe if I said it with the
powder next time trying to get a little
bit of creasing on my upper lip very
faint lines but they are there I think
my pores for me look pretty good they're
not super emphasized or anything yeah I
think my forehead is really the only
parts not looking super great right now
this lipstick is holding up good I mean
sysm other way in real life you can kind
of see more of a distinction but I don't
know if it's - it doesn't look too dark
it just looks like the undertone is a
little bit off but again barely
noticeable I have a feeling at this
point this is one of those that I would
have to set my face with the powder at
least on the center of my forehead I'll
check in with you guys at the end of the
night and I think I am going to start
doing the last check-ins
in like the bathroom lighting just you
can see it more realistic with this
camera so see you guys at the end of the
night I hope you like new cameras all
right so it's now 7 o'clock so the
Foundation's been on for 11 hours and
I'm looking pretty oily we're in the
bathroom right now so I'm under the
bathroom lighting I hope you guys can do
this but it's separated on my forehead
quite a bit I think you can see that
it's also
settling into some of my lines up here
it just kind of looks like it's sitting
on top of my skin on my forehead I
wouldn't say the rest of my face looks
great but it also doesn't look horrible
do have some creasing on my upper lip
around my nose looks a bit oily so I
think this might just be one that I need
to set even though it does have a powder
kind of finish when you first put it on
I'm obviously quite really right now and
I think I would use this again just with
it powders I'll try that out and let you
guys know by the way we're doing an
update for have to mention us doing a
wrap up video again this series we're
going to be ranking all the foundations
trying them out again and since I'm
sharing the three or four thief's a
couple weeks in advance we'll have more
than 15 days to throughout the video
right now I'm not in love and I also
don't hate it I just think this might be
one that you need to work with a little
bit figure out how it stays best so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
did and you're excited for this new
camera because I am give it a thumbs up
so I know love you guys thanks for
watching see you tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
