foundation we're on a first-name basis
now
all right so today it is day one of 15
days of foundation I can't believe I'm
actually saying those words right now it
is here folks it is here so 15 days of
foundation is where I test out a new
foundation every single day for 15 days
I've done a few other series all the
videos are separated out into different
playlists so if you want to go back and
watch different seasons I'll link them
down below in the description box if
this is your first 15 days of foundation
Series watching in live time leave a
comment down below say hi to the Bay
radio fam welcome I talked all about 15
days of foundation this time around
what's different what's the same
everything you need to know in the last
foundation Friday video which was the
cleaning powder first like two and a
half minutes talked all about series in
my time when I'm starting to film these
it's actually August 8th today I haven't
even posted the announcement video yet
but I hope you guys are excited don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up
while you're watching if you're excited
for 15 days foundation and you enjoy
these videos so every single day for the
next 15 days 6 p.m. Pacific Time 9 p.m.
Eastern Time
a p.m. central time there it is there'll
be a new video going up make sure you
have notifications turned on so you
don't miss any at the end of each video
I always show your guys's beautiful
faces from using the hashtag 15 days of
foundation on social so if you want to
be featured here are my social channels
follow along send me your pics that
sounded alright so moving into
foundation number one this has been
requested from you guys on social this
is a new foundation from Laura Mercier
it's the flawless fusion ultra long wear
foundation here's what the box looks
like pretty basic so I try and do a mix
of high end and drugstore foundations
throughout this series but we're gonna
start off strong with one of the most
requested foundations from you guys so
let's read some of the claims about this
thing it retails for $48 and you get one
fluid ounce of product so not a cheap
foundation it comes in 20 shades ranging
from the shade 1 c1 shell which is what
I have to 6 and 1 truffle is the deepest
shade so there one sentence brief
summary of this foundation is a 15 hour
long wearing oil free liquid foundation
with a matte finish and weightless
medium to full coverage my wear tests
are usually 10 hours I feel like that's
a decent amount of time to wear
foundation throughout the day so we'll
see how it's looking at the 10 hour
point 15 hours would be like the middle
of the night
high performance that sweat humidity
water and transfer resistant color stays
true won't oxidize says it controls oils
immediately
and throughout the day matte finish is
never dull flat or cakey so I do have
combination skin I get oily throughout
the day so we'll see how this controls
my oil insert swatches right here of the
shade 1 c1 shell next to some of my
other foundation so you can see how the
lighter shade compares all right so
swatch time right here's the Laura
Mercier foundation in the shade 1 c1
shell next way is derma called 2:08
which is pretty much my closest shape
match I have a whole review on this I
still get questions about derma Col
makeup for ever matte velvet plus in the
shade 15 before I talk sizes this one
when it oxidizes gets about a shade
darker Urban Decay Naked Skin Foundation
and 0.5 and Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless and 110 so as you can see the
lightest shade of the Laura Mercier one
is pretty dark if you want to see my
thoughts on the Laura Mercier ultra no
flawless fusion ultra long wear
foundation I can't get that right and
how it applies and wear throughout the
day you're in the right place just keep
watching alright I have removed my fur
back here today some of you guys have
been saying that it looks like angel
wings I'm short
this chair is tall I don't know let me
know if you like it I feel like I look
too short maybe I just need a new chair
chair dilemmas so I prep and prime my
skin the same in every single foundation
video just to keep it consistent so I
use the Urban Decay rehab makeup prep
moisturizer and then I go in with the
hilum I'd matte 12 primer these are my
go-to so link them down below in every
single video if I don't mention it so
what I'm using I always try out a brush
on one side of my face and then a sponge
on the other so sponge i use is the
morphe sponge this one is amazeballs
this is my favorite sponge and on the
other side today I'm gonna try the elf
ultimate blending brush I've been really
enjoying this brush my go-to brushes are
the Sigma f80 82 a different elf brush
and I also really like this one of
course there's like a friggin cement
truck parked outside make a noise right
now ooh very nice sleek packaging it's a
pretty narrow I have this shade 1 c1
shell you guys will have already seen
swatches but I haven't watched it yet I
always get questions about this I just
use a bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks candle it I have
for years it's a great foundation
palette any day now well it has a very
tiny hole I'm gonna start with a sponge
on this side of my face okay off the bat
this is definitely gonna be oh yeah this
is dark
it actually looks lighter on the
viewfinder right now in real life this
is about at least two shades dark like
it looks straight-up orange good thing
I'm just
I'm gonna be home today because whoa
house pretty good coverage that I would
say high medium you can still see my
acne and some stuff coming through but
it looks pretty nice looks a tiny bit
heavy around my pores but everywhere
else that looks very smooth looks like a
soft matte finish forgot to tell you
guys the time right now it's whoa that
was a great what am i doing it's 9:24
looks nice on the center of my forehead
that's kind of like the true test for me
is how it looks right on the center cuz
that's where I have tons of texture and
a lot of foundations look super cakey
right there especially matte ones this
one is looking pretty good on the center
of my forehead so I like how that
applied with a sponge let's try a brush
on the other side both brush and sponge
I would say this one is solid medium
coverage for some reason it actually
looks a little bit dewier on this side
usually with a sponge it does since you
have the moisture in there this is very
confusing I don't think I've ever had
that happen it looks straight-up satin
on this side of my face didn't have
anything on this brush I don't think
that would have caught that well I like
this side better I actually think I
might have gotten a tiny bit better
coverage on my acne on this side I also
had more acne on this side this is
supposed to be buildable so I'm just
gonna take a really small amount and see
if I can cover it down here a little bit
more with the brush on this side I'm not
gonna do a full second layer I don't
feel like I need it okay so that is
covering it actually looks a bit heavy
right on the center my forehead I'm
gonna take this sponge and just see if I
can get that kind of excess product off
or whatever is happening up close it
looks a little bit heavy on my forehead
it also looks heavy around my nose area
in my pores alright now I don't not like
how it looks
besides the shade I wear this one again
I definitely have to mix in either
foundation Lightner or another
foundation it's already starting to
crease a tiny bit right here on my upper
lip and just the way that it's sitting I
feel like this might be a creaser but
we'll see it's drying down which I like
it doesn't feel super sticky or anything
feels like I could blend product on top
of here because of that and it's
supposed to be 15 hour where foundation
I don't think I'm going to powder my
face with this one I have foundations
that look and perform better on my skin
without powder and vice versa so it
really just depends on the prod
okay and actually this side is starting
to look a lot more matte now it's kind
of matching this side it doesn't look
quite as satin right now it is 932 I'm
gonna apply the rest of my makeup I'm
super excited to do eyeshadow right now
for some reason I'm in like an eye
shadow mood I'm gonna do my makeup and
I'll be right back okay it is now 10:20
we're gonna call the check-in time 9:40
I think I said 9:30 last time I talked
to you guys so that's when I finished up
my face makeup I was doing my makeup out
in my living room to use that mirror and
I feel like I look old like this
foundation makes my skin look 10 years
older than it is it's creasing up here
settling into some lines it looks a
little bit heavy there are certain parts
of my face it look really nice and
smooth like my cheek area then around my
nose and overall just on my forehead and
my chin it just looks a little bit heavy
so here's a little look at natural
lighting it's actually looking way
better what the heck I think this is too
good of lighting hold on let me try and
get it so you can actually see what I'm
saying
thank you guys can see this creasing
right here looks a little bit dry just
sitting a bit heavy and you can see in
my pores you're like pretty emphasize
right there around my nose area actually
looks kind of like dry and a little bit
textured Ashley feel like this is a
little bit more accurate I think you can
see a little bit better here as you can
see I blended it pretty far down my neck
this is where it stops and then here's
my actual skin tone it completely dried
down to like almost a powder finish so
it was easy to blend product on top of
it but with that being said when I went
to put on my concealer I use the BH
Studio Pro concealer really difficult to
blend it in with the foundation I got
this like weird line right here which is
like almost what happens when you put a
liquid on top of a powder for whatever
reason that shade on camera is looking a
lot better so much I guys this on the
rest of my face for eyes I was feeling
the purple with the nails all of my
eyeshadow from the jaclyn hill morphe
palette eyelashes are Ardell to 50s I
forgot how much I liked these for
bronzer I used elf Saint Lucia and I
went in with L'Oreal glam bronze and
zero one light pale I was like a contour
and then for lips I used the color pop I
love sera he and curvy then my highlight
was just the second shade over I love
this shade as a face highlight so
check-in time is 9:40 next check and I
do will be in
or lighting if I can keep my lashes on
that long this will be a miracle I'll
see you guys in a few hours it looks
like I just worked out but it definitely
didn't all right so it's now 253 so the
Foundation's been on for a little over
five hours the lashes stayed on for a
solid hour so looking at the foundation
I actually like how it looks a little
bit better now I feel like it's wearing
fairly well my forehead looks definitely
better than five hours ago area don't
like how it's looking is still around my
nose and upper lip it looks a little bit
heavy and I'm getting some creasing
around here and the shade for whatever
reason it looks like it matches the
viewfinder right now when I look at my
face in here it is orange so here's my
forehead clearly like a little bit
textured don't like how it looks around
here just like Kay can you see it
creasing right there looks a bit heavy
down here so I'll see you guys at the
end of the night
okay so right now it's 818 p.m. so it's
been on for a little over 10 hours it's
held up pretty well I feel like just
filmed part of a haul so I'm
everywhere right now my oil looks pretty
good right now it's not too oily my
forehead I feel like is actually kind of
warm better throughout the day the area
where I don't like it is how it's been
all day right here I'm wondering if
maybe like a smoothing primer or
something would help that separating a
bit down here overall right now not bad
not loving it not hating it you can see
it there's like a straight up orange
line right now I don't know I think this
is one that I need to wear a couple more
times maybe mix in with something I
don't think I would wear this with the
powder though I think it'd hold up
pretty well without a powder don't feel
like I really need to set this I don't
know just kind of nothing really stands
out about this one but I'll keep trying
it out and see what I think of it there
is a wrap up video at the end of the
series where I rank all two foundations
number 1 to 15 and since these are
pre-recorded I actually get a pretty
decent amount of time to test out the
rest of foundations so I hope you guys
enjoyed a one a 15 days foundation I
feel extra tired right now like it's
only 8 p.m. but I feel like I could fall
asleep right now if you enjoyed this
video and you're excited for 15 days of
foundation don't forget to give this a
thumbs up why am I
right now love you guys thanks for
watching see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
