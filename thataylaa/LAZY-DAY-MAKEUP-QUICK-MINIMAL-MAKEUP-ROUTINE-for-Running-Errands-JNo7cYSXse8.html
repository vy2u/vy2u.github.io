Friday we're doing something a little
bit different I wanted to show you guys
my kind of quick lazy makeup this is for
running errands what I do for Foundation
and I also show you the rest of my face
because it takes like two seconds this
is what I do if I'm just running out the
door want to look like I have my
together if I'm going to a doctor's
appointment go in to run errands I would
say if I'm grocery shopping but I never
grocery shop team Amazon fresh and
instacart if I want to still look put
together but I want to do the most
minimal make-up possible this is a look
that I do this is what I most often wear
if I want like a step up from this I
actually filmed my everyday makeup
routine or work-appropriate makeup
routine that is a little bit next level
this is like the bare minimum what I do
so I hope you guys enjoy this video I
also tell you really quick how I do my
hair and I show you my outfit so if
you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the BAE Rito
family and subscribe I upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. soup time
here we go alright so basically I do
minimal steps for every possible thing
usually when I do this I can get
everything done in about 10 or 15
minutes usually about ten but one thing
I always take the time to do is prep my
skin because then whatever you put on
top of it is just gonna look so much
better so I have already washed and
moisturize my face using the survey
hydrating cleanser in the survey daily
moisturizer I'll have them both linked
down below but then just make sure my
skin is super moisturized and ready I
gone with the Too Faced hangover at 3
and 1 priming spray so I make them I do
about I don't even know five six breeze
whatever covers my face pending on how
good my aim is that day for my hair on
lazy days I almost always either put it
in a ponytail or just throw it up into a
super high bun messy bun thing like this
and I literally just grab all of my hair
put one of those what are those call
like the scrunchie wrap things the
ponytails that I'll have them like down
below if I can find money Amazon or
something but they're great for messy
buns if you have a on a pair so I
kind of just wrap that around and pull
out some pieces so now that my face is
looking nice and glowy and dewy for
foundation the quickest foundation I
find for me to apply is the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD stick foundation I talked
about
for years I love this foundation it
gives you full coverage super quick I
actually did the ten minute makeup
challenge a while ago like a year or two
ago and I'm pretty sure I use this
foundation in that video because it's
just so quick to blend out and
everything this stick foundation is what
I use if I still want that full coverage
look if I want something that looks way
more natural and just glowy and less
coverage a bone at the CYO long lasting
life proof foundation I feel like I have
a ton of videos using this lately so I'm
gonna switch it up and do my makeup
forever today I'm gonna start out with
the shade wide to 15 and if I feel like
I needed deepen it up a little bit I'm
gonna use our 330 I actually gave my mom
this one and she didn't like the smell
of it it does smell really bad that's
the one thing with this foundation like
dude makeup forever it smells like a
freaking fish market so I literally just
draw this thing on and the key with this
foundation for me is putting a lot on
the first time around I don't really
like building it up so I just totally
draw this thing on and I think I'm gonna
need to darken this a little bit today
so I'm gonna do one or two stripes of a
dark one and then to blend it out I like
to use the Sigma f80 - I like this brush
or an elf brush I'll link it down below
and I actually don't like to apply any
concealer under my eyes or anything when
I do this I'm bringing this right
underneath my eyes I don't find that it
crease is really bad or anything but if
it does since I'm not powdering you can
just tap it out throughout the day and
usually when I do this I'm not trying to
have like a super you know long-lasting
thing it's like I'm going to run errands
or going to an appointment or whatever
it is so it doesn't need to last for
hours on end if I'm like really in a
rush I don't really do this in sections
I'll just put it all over my face at one
time and this foundation works pretty
great for all skin types when I had oily
skin and would use this I obviously
wouldn't use like a dewy priming spray
or anything you could use an oil
controlling primer or something
underneath if you wanted to and on my
dry skin it works great doesn't
emphasize my dryness at all and gives
you that do so I'm pulling this over my
eyelids as well and I like using this
brush because it is a stiffer brush so
it just works really well with stick
foundations all right
since we got full coverage there I don't
need to go in with any concealer or
anything I like the look of no concealer
under my eyes when I'm doing this kind
of look because I find when you put
concealer on at least on my skin with
the powder and everything it just looks
kind of more done up versus if you just
leave your skin looking like skin and
your under eyes and stuff are still kind
of coming through a little bit it just
looks a tiny bit more natural if you
will so for brows I do have permanent
eyebrows on which I have a whole video
on and I would highly recommend I love
my permanent brows I know when I do
makeup videos and stuff I do like a full
on brow on top of it but I love them for
this reason when I don't have any makeup
on my brows are on and when I'm just
doing minimal makeup like this all I do
is just go in with the old to brow gel
and sometimes I don't even do this
especially if I'm good about not getting
my foundation over my brows that's the
only thing is that since they're not
actual hairs if you get foundation over
it kind of covers it up which is why I
use this but if you wanted to you could
just use a q-tip to remove the
foundation off and then you won't have
to do anything to your brows I just find
the permanent brows save so much time
and even when I do my full on makeup
just because you already have the shape
there it's so much easier I get my done
at fine line Studios Kerry she's amazing
she does such a great job that's all I
do for brows I just quickly take my Lord
Geller powder on the area's I'm gonna be
putting blush and stuff just so I don't
have to worry about blending on top of
this this just saves time blending and
everything and that takes like two
seconds I need to clean this desk so bad
I've been on like a filming spree okay
for real sorted oh here it is right
where it's supposed to be so I take this
brush this was from the Amazon brush set
did a whole video testing these I love
to use this for blush and bronzer lately
so I'm going to take the Physicians
Formula bronzer I'm just depending on
how I mix the foundation shade like if I
feel like it's a tiny bit too light
I'll go in with bronzer but on most days
I usually just use blush but I'm just
gonna add a tiny bit today because I
feel like I could have a little bit of
warmth going on and it's okay if it's
not fully blended I'm gonna go in with
the blush and blend everything together
I'm trying to do this out like the speed
that I would do it normally it's just so
you guys can see obviously I'm talking
and stuff so it takes longer so then I'm
taking the Physicians Formula blush
butter blush and rosy pink
and tapping this over again I'm gonna
blend it out with a different brush so
it's okay oh I've got too much of that
one I might take that same powder blush
and blend this out I really like a light
pink kind of blush like this on days
when I do this kind of makeup cuz it
just gives you that really pretty flush
I would say most days when I do this I
almost always just do blush and
highlight just because it's quick but I
always do a highlight and I usually use
the elf illuminating palette this that
shade right there the one I picked pan
on because it just gives you this really
natural glow and just looks really
flattering on and it's quick it takes
like two seconds to do highlight so not
really wasting a whole lot of time so
some days I'll just do my face I don't
know about you but sometimes I feel like
my eyes look better without any makeup
on it then when I just do mascara I just
gonna go with whatever I'm feeling my
eyes have been really dry and kind of
itchy from the accutane so some days I
just don't even want to put any mascara
on and deal with it usually if my
eyelids are kind of sticky from putting
the foundation over I'll just take that
same powder whatever I used and rub it
over my eyelid just so it's not sticky
there and so the mascara won't transfer
up to my brow bone right here if you
want to you could take your same bronzer
shade if you used one and just throw
this into the crease it just blends out
super easily and adds a little bit of
something to your eyes if someone used a
Catrice glamour doll when I'm full
undoing my makeup I like to layer this
with the Too Faced better than sex but
this on its own is great as well I live
in Seattle so we get rain as I'm sure
you've heard and this one doesn't run or
anything in the rain I don't think this
is technically waterproof but it doesn't
actually run yeah it doesn't say on here
that it's waterproof but again I've
never had issues with it really running
and when I do this I kind of tried and
focus some of the mascara on just the
outer lashes right here so it makes your
eyes look a little bit bigger I don't
usually like to do bottom mascara on
these days because I feel like it just
adds a little too much I feel like it
just looks more fresh without it
especially since I didn't set my under
eyes I don't want the mascara to
transfer down there if I did put bottom
mascara on whenever I do this on camera
I'm thinking more about keeping my mouth
closed and actually putting on the
mascara now we're looking a little more
awake just gonna go in with my lip
product this is what I use 99.9 percent
of the time if I'm doing look like this
or if I have no makeup on I'm going out
this is the lemis lip sleeping mask I've
talked about this before in a monthly
favourites video I am almost out of this
thing this whole jar it is such a
beautiful like light pink kind of color
and just gives you this really pretty
plump kind of look if you wanted it a
little bit more light or nude sometimes
I'll just use my foundation brush and
just brush it over my lips first and
then put that on and it gives it a
really pretty like light pink kind of
look but because my lips are pretty dry
right now I don't want to do that so
this is what we're doing last step I do
is just put on perfume because I feel
like if you smell good then people think
you have your life together I'm just
spraying the Stella McCartney what was
this one called peony I just sprayed
that on my hand that definitely wasn't
my wrist I think is just called Stella
can't remember it smells so good and
it's really nice like daytime one cuz
it's just really fresh even if I'm just
like running out the door I usually
always spray some kind of perfume on or
body splash or something so that is
literally all I do I feel like this is
probably a hello fast video but
everything I used again will be linked
down below in the description box I'll
show you guys a quick shot of my outfit
what I usually wear I am headed to the
post office right now so that's what I'm
wearing this woful print kind of
long-sleeve is from Abercrombie and it's
a comfiest thing ever I have this in
three colors like slouchy and loose so
you don't have to worry about you know
we're in like a tight shirt or whatever
it's just really comfortable and then I
usually throw on some kind of vest or
something I have like different puffer
vests and this one is actually just from
Walmart a couple years ago I don't know
if they still carry this but I'll try
and find something similar and link it
down below but it was like 15 bucks I
want to say and I feel like it's really
cute like you would never know this from
Walmart and it has this really soft
collar right here and I boost our uggs
if you live anywhere where it rains or
snows these technically can be snow
boots too and I just feel like they're
so cute they're very wearable rain and
snow boots
that's my outfit I'll throw on some kind
of down coat because it's freezing and
raining outside and that's everything so
I hope you guys enjoyed this if you did
make sure to give it a thumbs up I love
you guys thanks for watching see you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
