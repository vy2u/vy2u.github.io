I'm buying two light bulbs let's just
start vlogging tonight we're going into
Home Depot to get new lighting for to
attempt to film a study whoa what is
going on here Oh
do-it-yourself clinic I don't even know
what kind of lights are you doing huh
probably should have done some like
lighting research before it just has to
be like a I think it's called like soft
lights or something it's like for studio
lighting but it has to be white it has
to be really white soft wait I think
these are it I need something to like
kidding I mean I have no idea screw than
to live no you have to like I don't know
let's check all the options
okay sidetracked by RG need only two
feet from Oroku one can see okay maybe
like I'm Dexter now when I look at
bathtubs I think of breaking done well
we had a very successful Home Depot trip
I'd say what would you say week truly
truly successful got some bolts let's
see how how this works I really did zero
research on this so I think I didn't
research like a month ago
why do you know the thrift store is
right across the street we just dropped
a friend off at the airport and you know
right now who knows what what the night
holds for us what you actually have
homework are you actually gonna do your
homework I just talked to her well then
why are we going back for you to do your
homework studio lighting in here
what because they look like brand-new I
guess no I actually found a pair of
shoes I'm gonna like step out or
something and then I'm debating whether
or not I should get these two song let's
see yeah it's kind of bizarre there's an
abnormal amount of shoes right now
oh I want to do the studio lights the
ones that we just bought ok so we got
back like an hour ago and we had a super
deep talk so obviously gonna feel that
you're fairly successful at the thrift
store I got this black skirt for like 3
bucks high-waisted and like pleat
pleated sat with us called and this
chiffon rose kind of top okay I'm doing
a really bad job at showing these like
super cute tucked into the skirt hoping
these are the right light bulbs and now
we're gonna rocks Rachel's eyebrows and
we're eating wine and Claire we're gonna
be using the moon hair removal and you
can get this off Amazon for like 10
bucks and you just microwave it it's
been difficult
I do heat it up for way too long so
we're like waiting a critical who do
before of the eyebrows Oh God hey are
you seriously putting your phone in the
sink
okay but okay
I browse words and you can't even really
see what's letting out things I think we
figured this out it looks pretty good
this is literally our setup right now we
have one lamp clips in my purse the
other lamp clip to the top of my mirror
but basically like everything I read
online okay you want it to be away from
your face wonderful it looks gone this
camera this looks freaking good I am so
shocked I don't know if you guys can see
what I'm zoomed you in but look it's
freaking nighttime and look how good
this looks this is so great because now
I don't have to film that like very
inconvenient times in the middle of the
day this is the camp camera I just got
the Canon t3i I love it so far the
viewfinder is freaking amazing so much
easier to film with this is what happens
when you film a tutorial here Akal so
impressed guys so impressed so this cost
a total of 28 dollars which is freaking
amazing because I was looking at studio
lights and like the cheapest ones are
like $80 with mildly good reviews so if
you can create some kind of setup like
this for twenty eight dollars I feel
like that's pretty dang good know if you
guys want a video about that not that
I'm very knowledgeable in the area happy
 Friday literally the longest
week ever watching some of the vlog
footage back from last night and I
realized that my head was like chopped
out hello hi in about 99% of it so
apologies for that I know why like we
just randomly decided to vlog last night
I don't know I think you're just like in
a good mood you know feeling happy it's
almost Friday just living like shirt a
thumbs up if you like vlogs and if you
want more vlogs I don't know what I'm
calling this yet my turkey bacon may be
made in I'm gonna make some breakfast
and then literally gonna spend all day
filming and editing because I have a
 ton of videos to get up I think my
stomach is growling and he's like
flipping out the
so I just finished getting ready clearly
I don't let you guys know a little bit
of what I use also if you're following
my Instagram you saw that I went a
little bit crazy in the drugstore it was
bad so I tried out some of the new stuff
I got so for a foundation right now I'm
wearing the covergirl outlast three and
one which I'm sure everyone and their
mothers have tried except me
I don't wanna do first impressions on
this because there are so many freaking
out there I like how it went on I set it
with the Ben Nye luxury powder and cameo
if you're wondering other new stuff I
tried out holy balls guys Physicians
Formula I booster 2 &amp;amp; 1 whatever lash
boosting so liquid eyeliner freakin
amazing it looks like this I really like
the packaging too I usually use the
L'Oreal super slim infallible and I do
really like this but I think this is
gonna be my new favorite it goes on so
and look at my eyes just look at them it
goes on so black so easy it's it's
honestly unlike any other liquid liner
I've ever tried I tried this this I mean
this is new for me I haven't used this
part of the palette yet but the Urban
Decay
Anarchy palette I used the blush that's
in the bottom it's so hard to
open I don't know why they made it this
difficult yeah it's not happening
anyways it's the blush in this palette
you can google image it but it's this
like pinky blush and I also used the
highlighter from the palette and my
cheekbones so far I like both of them
the highlighter is definitely not as
intense as the mary-lou manizer one but
it's nice if you just want like an
everyday kind of glow I wanted to film
today but I literally have too much
footage that is getting overwhelming I
have like 10 projects going on right now
and I'm in the midst of redoing my
website so I don't know I don't really
want to film because I don't want to get
overwhelmed with like the amount of
footage that I have to edit I got these
two colors at the drugstore pink one is
in the shade so much fun though and this
one's in the shade mint sorbet I know
it's like major grandma colors but for
some reason they're really appealing to
me I don't want to do the mint green one
struggles life of
nail polish addict oh I just took
Bentley for a walk we bonded back in the
leopard robe maybe I should just call
these leopard row vlogs I think that's
gonna happen now I'm just reading new
comments this uploaded the gold winged
eye tutorial so if you haven't watched
that go do that and I'm meeting a super
healthy meal of leftover buffalo wings
tots ranch and milk in of course the
infamous coca-cola cups that I mentioned
in like every video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
