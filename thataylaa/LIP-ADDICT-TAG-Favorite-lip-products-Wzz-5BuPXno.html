cherries so today we have the lymphatic
tag stoked to be doing this video I was
tagged by Shannon or Shannon so if you
don't know who she is you've probably
been living under a rock so that's what
we are doing today
super excited to do this I got the
questions ready to go let's get started
so I know I do have a shadow in schmooze
get ready with me video on the look I'm
wearing right now so if you're not
subscribed go ahead and do that so you
don't miss out on that video coming next
all I did was change up the lip color so
on my lips right now is manic panics
cross lip gloss and this is like new
from them I'm pretty sure this is in the
shade of black rose which is absolutely
beautiful and I ended up mixing it with
whitening lightening sugar mama and I
just love the formula of these and then
with this color on top of it feel like
it just gives you a nice summery kind of
dark berry color so I'm feeling it
anyways let's get started the first
question is what is your favorite balm
or treatment I'm super old school with
my bombs
not a huge fan of Baby Lips I like the
color ones just for the color but at the
actual formula of it I think it's just
way over hyped so I just like to go
classic with some old-school Carmex lip
balm I love the smell of this stuff it
is super moisturizing I put this on
every night before bed I gots for a
dollar from Dollar Tree so you can't go
wrong so the second question is what is
your favorite eye catching red lips
these I didn't only pick one product
because who the can do that my
favorite eye catching red was super
difficult for me because I'm all about
the Reds my all-time favorite favorite
red lip product is the covergirl outlast
5:23 I instagrammed a picture of this on
4th of July this is what I wore it is
just the best read ever it is a super
long-lasting formula it can be a little
bit drying so you definitely want to put
a bomb under it this stuff doesn't budge
it doesn't transfer I love this
my second favorite red lipstick is the
Milani lipstick and this is in 0-7 best
red this is a cool-toned red a link the
video down below where I use this I
think I used it in a shadow news video
with like elf foundation yeah I think it
was that one I shortened it up here
because I can't see down here this
one is just such a beautiful cool toned
red makes your teeth look whiter it is
90 degrees outside right now so I'm
trying not to turn on the fan for you
guys the best luxury and drugstore
product this one was hard for me in
multiple ways mostly because I don't
really have any luxury lip products
those are just not the kind of thing
that I usually go for spending a lot of
money on so the closest thing to a
luxury lip products that I have tried
that I really really love is the Stila
stay all day liquid lipstick I wish I
wish Miss video using this this is a
perfect dusty rose color stays on it
smells like frickin cake batter Mel so
good I really love this product and I
will be repurchasing more colors my
favorite drugstore lip product this was
super hard for me to answer because like
I said I have like 5 that I was in
drugstore favorite lip products when I
think of like one lipstick from the
drugstore that really stands out to me
it is the Rimmel Kate Moss lipstick in
0-8 just because I've been using this
for I don't even know where I'll throw
it winter it's one of those lipsticks
that you can wear on an everyday basis
and it doesn't look like you're trying
too hard and wearing lipstick but it
just gives you a little bit of color I
didn't breathe that whole sentence it's
just the perfect color the Rimmel Kate
Moss line is really nice if you're just
looking for an easy go-to everyday lip
color I would definitely check out this
one number four is best MAC lipstick I
have to because obviously how do you
choose one the first one is diva this is
just like my favorite color that Mac has
ever come out with it's like a deep
berry Bambi
bread it is just perfect especially for
winter this is like the one that I would
always send customers to it is perfect
my second one is a matte black lipstick
and this is hot core and this was a
limited edition I literally think I paid
$40 for this because I was like I cannot
not get the one black lipstick that Mac
comes out with I don't think the formula
of it is anything spectacular it's
mainly just that like Mac came out with
a black lipstick and I feel like I
needed it for my collection most
dissapointing lip product oh I don't
even know I really don't know just
cleaned out my makeup collection before
I moved so I feel like everything I have
right now I like gonna have to think
about this one I'm so hungry
burrito sounds bomb.com right now I'm
having a I'm spacing out and really need
to eat lunch moment right now so I'm
just gonna leave my least favorite lip
product down below once I've had time to
think about it so the next one is lip
liner : yes or no I think that lip liner
is necessary if you're wearing a dark
lipstick I can't do dark lips usually
without a lip liner my favorite lip
liner for that is by Palladio and you
can get this at Sally Beauty waterproof
and retractable and this is in the shade
blackberry this is a perfect lip liner
for diva or this Wet n Wild lipstick
which is called Cabernet oh the next one
is my favorite glosses before about
three weeks ago I never used to be a
gloss person I hated the feeling of
glosses on my lips I just couldn't do it
felt like it was gonna slide all over my
lips and I kind of usually like more
matte long-lasting kind of thing so I
don't have to be like fussing with it
every five minutes so I never gravitated
towards lip glosses and then whitening
lightening sent me these that color your
smile lip glosses I have more shades
back there if you can see I don't know I
was kind of curious to try them out
because I didn't know if it was going to
be kind of one of those things that's
just very hyped up in the beauty world
on YouTube and Instagram it's not shit's
real my two favorite shades I have from
them are sugar mama which I used in the
get ready with me video before this and
butter cream buttercream is a perfect
color if you
work and you want something on your lips
but you don't want it to be too much
I've been wearing this everyday for work
and then I just absolutely love sugar
mama I don't know what it is it makes
your whole complexion look like brighter
and I don't know it's amazing to have
these like color technology that makes
your teeth look whiter and there's a
freaking light on these like can you see
that there you go so these have been my
favorite lip glosses if you want to try
them out yourself I will leave a 25% off
code down below off your whole order so
the last question is something else
which could go in so many different ways
so I'm just gonna throw out some lip
products that didn't fit into any of
those categories and my eyes watering if
you watch any of my videos you know that
I'm totally a black lipstick person I
love it can't get enough of it
I wish I could wear it to work my two
favorite black lipsticks are the pretty
zombie cosmetics black cat and this is a
matte liquid lipstick you definitely
need a black lip liner with this because
it can be a little bit difficult to work
with because of the doe foot applicator
this is actually pretty affordable I
think it's like twelve dollars or
something from their website my second
favorite black lipstick is by Manic
Panic and look at the packaging so cute
it says this is satin black lipstick I
find that it looks matte on your lips
but it feels very moisturizing it
doesn't feel drying like a lot of black
lipsticks tend to feel which is why I
really like it number two for my
favorite black lipsticks so that was
everything all the videos I mentioned
will be linked down below if you want to
see those and thanks again Shannon for
tagging me in this video love you girl

to do more attack videos because I think
YouTube tag videos ever on my channel if
you want to see more of those be sure to
give this video a thumbs up so I know
love you guys thanks for watching see ya
my next video fight they should invent a
way of drinking coffee that goes inside
your lips so you don't have to get it
everywhere probably called a straw</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
