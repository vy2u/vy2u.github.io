Friday this is where I try out a new
foundation every single Friday on my
channel I wish you guys could see my
hands down here because what are they
doing I'm like this right now today is
another throwback foundation the l'oreal
true match foundation i like to do these
videos every now and then on products
that i have tried out before but i've
just never made a video on for whatever
reason i want to say about five six
years ago this was one of my go-to
foundations haven't used this foundation
for at least a couple years and my skin
was a lot different back then it wasn't
nearly as oily as it is now my acne five
or six years ago also definitely wasn't
as bad so i want to try this out again
right now with my current skin condition
and see what i think of this i don't
have a video yet on the L'Oreal True
Match Lumi so let me know if you guys
would want to see that one I do have
videos on all of the more recent popular
L'Oreal foundations like the total cover
pro glow Pro matte all of those so you
can just search it on YouTube and it'll
come up as far as the number of shades
available this product definitely takes
the cake for the drugstore this comes in
33 shades they do come in different
undertones which is really great I have
all three of the lightest shades from
the different undertone so I have N 1 W
1 and C 1 I'm going to search swatches
of all three of the shades I have
compared to some other drugstore
foundations and just some of my go-to s
alright so swatch shine the first three
are the L'Oreal True Match foundations
and the three lightest shades in each
undertone so right here is W 1 C 1 and N
1 next over is the lightest shade of the
covergirl vitalist foundation 7:05 the
fact that that's the lightest shade is
comical Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless and 1:10 derma file 2:08 and
laura geller cover lock in porcelain I
have reviews on all of these foundations
foundation retails for about between 8
and 11 bucks depending on where you get
it has 1 fluid ounce product which is
standard for foundation which is kind of
crazy because it looks like it's a
freaking mini bottle eye compared to
some other foundation bottles it looks
like you would get less product but it
does have a standard fluid ounce I'm not
super into the packaging of this because
it can get pretty messy since you just
have to pour it out there's no pump or
anything's reading some of the claims on
this it says it's formulated with
precise match technology so you can
control coverage and fine tune it
ultra-pure formula contains no oils
fragrances or pork clogging fillers all
you see is beautiful radiant flawless
skin it has SPF 17 it says the coverage
is light to medium I find that you can
really build this up you can kind of
customize it to whatever you want which
is great it says it's for all skin types
again I have combination skin with
cystic acne I get pretty good throughout
the day and I think that's everything so
even though this technically is in a
first impression I do the application
and wear tests and everything just you
can see how it goes on how it wears
throughout the day and what I think of
it right now since again I haven't used
this for a while if you like foundation
Fridays and you enjoy this video while
you're watching why am I so freaking
right now don't forget to give it a
thumbs up if you want to see my thoughts
on the l'oreal true match foundation how
it applies somewhere throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching
okay so right now it's about 9:30 it's
October 10th when I'm filming this I
have not started accutane yet I've
already washed moisturize primed my face
i primed half my face this side again
the Laura Mercier foundation primer so
in the past both W 1 and C 1 have not
quite been the exact shade for me so I
wanted to try and one so I just picked
this up a couple days ago this is the
shade and once they have neutral warm
and cool
Ashley prefer neutral or cool undertones
this shade looks like it might work it
looks a bit dark I've been used this
foundation for I want to say a couple
years when I was living abroad I
actually brought like 10 bottles of this
W one with me is this pretty much what I
wore I'm gonna start out with the
dampened sponge on this side I can't
remember if I like this better with the
brush or sponge this one for me I
definitely need to build up if I want
better coverage it's nice though because
it doesn't look cakey or heavy when you
go to build it up so one layer with the
sponge I got about medium coverage so
I'm taking my Sigma f80 flat kabuki on
the other side and let's see if there's
a difference in coverage the finish
seems to be actually a bit dewier on
this side that I didn't prime because
the primer kind of modified this side a
little bit so I like how the finish of
this actually looks on the not prime
side just because I do like a bit more
dewy but we'll see if they wear any
different they're out the day definitely
more Matt on this side though I got a
little bit better coverage on the brush
side but I feel like you can kind of see
my texture a bit more up here than on
the sponge side and I do have more acne
on this one shade right now so I'm gonna
do my usual go back and with a brush to
build up the coverage but then kind of
smooth it out with no product on the
sponge I'm just gonna add a tiny bit of
product and build this up on the areas
where I need more coverage this
foundation builds very well like you can
see that looks full coverage now down
there and it still doesn't look heavy or
anything it's even covering my neck acne
really well which usually I have to go
in with concealer to cover I'm gonna go
back in with the sponge and just smooth
everything out there's no product on
this by the way that is not a hickey it
is just a heat rash alright so there we
have it the two layers my acne is still
coming through a bit up here but the
rest of my face looks like pretty much
full coverage low full coverage I like
how it looks on my skin I think I
actually liked the not primed side
better right now just because that's the
finish that I usually like I think it
looks a little bit more skin like right
now it's 9:46 let's call a second time
9:45 this one I can kind of go either
way setting my face and not setting my
face it doesn't feel like it's totally
set down but it does feel like it's set
down enough to where I could blend
powder products on top I think I might
really lightly set it with my laura
geller powder that I usually use so I'm
gonna do the rest eye makeup and I'll be
right back okay so it's now ten twenty
seven so ten thirty we're calling the
check-in time 9:45 again since that's
when I finish up my face all I did was
super lightly set it with the laura
geller balance and brighten powder which
is looking good it doesn't look too
heavy again I still think the not prime
site is actually looking better it's
already starting to crease a little bit
on this side of my face as I was doing
the rest of my makeup I could actually
see this looking really nice with the
CYO long lasting foundation this is
super dewy and I feel like it would make
the finish of this look really nice so
I'm gonna try mixing those but for the
rest of makeup for bronzer I use the
fair to light I feel like I've used this
in oh I just used that in the last
two foundation Friday's maybe again I'm
filming these in the span of like a
couple of weeks that you guys are seeing
over a couple months so I'm probably
using some of the same products I'm just
into them right now but I use this
bronzer I use the only nude mob blush
this one is really pretty for the Fall
check out this freaking highlight today
this is the BH Cosmetics spotlight
palette if you
an intense highlight this is gorgeous
and I feel like it totally
overemphasizes my texture but I just
went in with the shade vivid which i
think is my favorite and the palette and
then for the rest of my eye makeup I use
the morphe 35o 2 palette I just
wondering what these two shades right
here these are the BH Studio Pro 2:02 I
feel like they're what ardell demi
wispies look like on other people but
they never look like that on my eyes and
these are a few bucks on BH Cosmetics
this is the shade FBF by pierre
cosmetics so pretty that's everything
again the check-in time is 9:45 I'll see
you guys in a few hours in natural
lighting ok so it's now 2:35 so it's
been on for almost 5 hours I just
dropped my camera so thank God that this
still works because I've already gone
through two of these so I'm getting some
pretty intense upper lip creasing right
now I'm gonna zoom you guys in and
creasing around the nose but really this
upper lip is like friggin intense but
the rest of my face still looks good I'm
starting to get a tiny tiny bit of
separation right here on the forehead
but overall looks fine again if I were
to wear this like tomorrow I would
definitely do a couple of things
different I probably still do two layers
but I would just use majorly like dewy
and moisturizing products underneath and
on top and I might even just do one
layer in the spot conceal just to avoid
someone like the creasing and just
heaviness but overall I don't think it
looks like bad right now but I'll see
you guys at the end of the night ok so
it's no 806 so it's been on for over 10
hours I actually think this lighting
right here is perfect for check-ins why
haven't up and doing this I don't have
the ring lid on I just have one of the
softbox lights on but I feel like you
can pretty accurately see what I'm
saying I actually do think there's a
little difference between the primed and
not set prime side my nose definitely
looks oily over here on my forehead I
have a little bit of creasing and it
seems to be kind of wearing off a little
bit up here but my oil overall right now
looks pretty good for 10 hours I'm not
overly oily I have a tiny bit of shine
on the center of my forehead which is
normal it's separating quite a bit I
just noticed over here I thank you guys
and see that but yeah there's quite a
bit of separation around my
and chin over here and on this side as
well countess all over my chin area I
guess that I haven't used this
foundation for a couple years your skin
can change over the years mine
definitely has I still like this one I
just don't think I would use it with
that powder and I would definitely use
it with some kind of moisturizing dewy
setting spray I think that could give it
more of like a skin finish like I said I
do remember it being like a little bit
more dewy radiant looking which I don't
feel like I really got when I put it on
today so don't know why that was not my
favorite foundation or anything at the
moment
