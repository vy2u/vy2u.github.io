Friday this is where I try out a new
foundation every single Friday on my
channel today we're gonna be talking
about a foundation that I feel like is
probably one of the most invisible
foundations out there in the sense that
has anyone ever noticed this you may
have seen this foundation looked at it
and not thought twice about buying it at
least that's my experience with it I
actually did a whole video on hidden
drugstore makeup products that I've
never really noticed before or I have
and I've just never bought for whatever
reason I'm gonna link that video in the
I over here if you missed it but I think
I actually mentioned this foundation in
that video but this is the l'oreal
visible lift serum absolute foundation
it's one of those foundations and I feel
like for whatever reason I haven't heard
anything about over the years so I
wanted to give this a go
so this foundation get one fluid ounce
which is standard and it retails for
about between 11 bucks and 15 bucks
depending on where you get it the most
information I found on this was on
L'Oreal's website so that's where we are
gonna read some of the claims so it says
as age minimizing makeup features an age
reversing serum of 5 ingredients in one
radiant makeup instantly even skin tone
with a luxurious lightweight formula
that doesn't settle into lines and
wrinkles so the finish is radiant SPF 17
it is amazing how many huge brands have
airs on their descriptions that is what
I've learned from foundation Friday
coverage medium and all skin types this
comes in 12 shades I have the lightest
shade which is 143 soft ivory so I'm
gonna swatch is right here of soft ivory
compared to some of the other
foundations that I own I'm gonna throw
in a few more drugstore foundations in
these swatches just so we can compare
them all alright so swatch time I just
was holding a hot pack so my arm is like
a little bit red underneath here but
here we go swatches so right here is the
Loreal foundation and the lightest shade
143 next over is Maybelline fit me matte
and poreless and 110 by the way I'm just
watching a bunch of drugstore ones
doesn't necessarily mean I like them I
just want to show you the lightest
shades and each one so you can get an
idea of how it compares next over is the
CYO long lasting foundation the lightest
shade this I tried out in the CYO first
impressions video pretty sure that video
will be up before this one next over is
covergirl vitalist elixir in the
lightest shade 7:05 which is definitely
way too dark for me after makes that one
wet-and-wild photo focus foundation
lightest shade and then just a couple of
my usual ones I swatch so you can get an
idea this is the pur cosmetics bear doll
foundation in the lightest shade
porcelain and derma called two zero
eight alright there we have swatches I
think that is everything I have combo
skin with cystic acne I'm currently on
accutane when you guys are seeing this
video so this is a pre-recorded video
I'm gonna have the foundation Friday
playlist linked down below in the
description box if you want to go back
and watch any other videos if you're
excited for this video don't forget to
give it a thumbs up while you're
watching let's get into it if you want
to see what I think of the L'Oreal
invisible the note visible did I say
invisible before visible lift foundation
how it applies and wear this throughout
the day you're in the right place just
keep watching all right it's 816 in the
morning September 30th when I'm filming
this and I've already washed moisturize
primed half of my face again so I used
the Laura Mercier foundation primer this
has been one of my favorite primers for
years now I just haven't used it in a
while so I want to whip it back out
again but just primed this side of my
face so I'm gonna give this a shake my
lash extensions have definitely seen
better days right now I'm letting them
all fall out right now so it's a really
cute phase where they're like half in
half out I haven't watched this yet but
in the bottle
it looks like the shade might be pretty
nice so start out with a brush on this
side of my face I'm gonna use the Sigma
f80 one of my favorite foundation
brushes flat top kabuki this is supposed
to be medium coverage oh this is very
scented I literally can't put my finger
on what that smells like some kind of
soap or something that's sitting on my
skin pretty nice so with the brush I
agree with the medium coverage claim it
looks really nice so when you guys are
seeing this video I will be on full 5
weeks a week 5 of accutane week 4 it is
covering my acne pretty well I'm gonna
smooth over my forehead with a sponge I
think I got barely noticeable but a tiny
bit better covered on the brush side I
think I'm gonna use the sponge though
for thin second layer just to see if I
can get a little bit better coverage now
I'm gonna switch back to the brush okay
do you like this one better with a brush
so I just used a dab of product on this
side just go over my acne again and it's
covering really well I would say I'm at
pretty much full coverage
it doesn't look quite as luminous as I
was expecting doesn't say luminous I'm
here yeah it says luminous makeup result
on here and it's also a serum foundation
thought it's gonna be a little bit more
dewy but it looks like a nice satin
matte kind of finish prime side versus
not prime side seems to be looking about
the same I like the tone of this I think
once I have bronzer on and everything
it'll be a perfect shade it looks a tiny
tiny bit dry around my nose and on my
upper lip but other than that I really
have no complaints right now it looks
pretty damn good center of my forehead
looks nice so it definitely feels like I
could blend product on top of here it
doesn't feel super tacky it does have a
little bit of stick to it right now it's
not totally set down but I would
definitely be able to blend on top of
here so I don't think I'm gonna powder
my face with this one because I like the
finish and everything right now I don't
want it to kind of cake up so we're
gonna call the start time 8:30 by the
way got a new phone background exciting
updates so 8:30 check-in I'm gonna do
the rest of makeup and I will be right
back it's now 904 literally don't know
how that just took me a half hour I did
the most basic makeup ever it looks
great it looks good still no complaints
everything blended out fine on top I
like the way my forehead is looking
definitely looks more on the matte side
though I found myself really trying to
like layer on the highlight because I
just felt like I looked a little bit
dull or something I think this is one
that maybe like the makeup forever mist
and fix setting spray a setting spray
that gives like a really dewy finish I
feel like that might look really
beautiful on top of this but so far so
good so on the rest of my face I use the
elf Saint Lucia
bronzer the shade right there contoured
a little bit with the Kevyn Aucoin
tropical nights the latest little ombre
thing in there blushes Max Factor nude
mauve and my eyes all I did was put that
same contour shade in my crease and then
put L'Oreal 300 matte just on the lids
my eyeliner is wet and wild Pro line
color pop honey dude on my waterline
just to brighten it up I tried out this
Ardell Forever kissable lip stain look
at how light it looks on the bottom okay
this is like a straight up fuchsia color
it doesn't even look like the tip it is
like fuchsia so it's not expecting that
I'm about to go to brunch I'm not trying
to eat some
in case with the fuchsia lip then I put
the wet and wild new dupa 2d liquid
katsu lipstick over top and I like this
combo and highlight use the fenty Beauty
girl next door and she Creek I just went
in with the shade right here I'm gonna
go eat and I'll check in with you guys
in a few hours natural lighting okay so
it's 117 so it's been on for almost 5
hours
it doesn't look horrible it doesn't look
good I'm gonna zoom you guys in so
there's some definite upper lip creasing
on both primed and not prime side it
looks like it's starting to separate a
little bit on my chin it's not
separation or is it rubbing off over
there right in the center a bit I
thought it might have just been like
separating around the zip but it's kind
of like all over here if you look really
close the rest of my forehead doesn't
look bad
I mean from far away it looks fine it's
just when you get really up close and
you can see all the creasing around my
nose and everything but right now I
wouldn't say I'm liking how it looks I
probably wouldn't wear this alone again
I mix it in with something a little bit
more dewy and actually I might mix this
in with the covergirl vitalist
cuz that one is too dark but it's really
nice and dewy and it lasts really long
so that might be a good one to mix this
way let's do you guys at the end of the
night okay so it's now 6:40 so it's been
on for 10 hours and there's a little bit
of what glue this it looks good so it's
been on for 10 hours it's not looking
the best I haven't been doing like
anything strenuous I've just been on the
couch editing and my forehead looks
pretty bad it's like breaking down a lot
and just kind of rubbing off even though
I don't feel like it really been
touching my forehead a whole lot like on
the top up here it's kind of rubbed off
I think prime which is this side first
is not prime side I mean I think you can
see it's just worn off in certain places
like over here kind of all over here to
my chin a little bit breaking down I
just don't feel like it looks the most
flattering I think for me I would only
use this one as kind of if I need like a
drugstore mixer or something if I want
to mix this one to lighten another
foundation because I do like to shade
this
kind of neutral tone and it didn't
oxidize throughout the day so that's
good I wouldn't wear this one again on
its own I don't think a powder would
really help with this one on my skin
because I can just tell a certain
foundations when it's going to get
really heavy looking and that's kind of
how I feel with this one if I put a
powder on it but not super excited about
it I liked how it looked when I first
went on and it's just kind of gone
downhill so I think for me this one is a
pass let me know if you tried this what
you think of it if you have any way you
like to wear it that makes it last
longer does it separate on your skin let
us know down below so hope you guys

forget to give it a thumbs up so I love
you guys thanks for watching see you in
my next video right I'm gonna have the
foundation Friday playlist foundation
