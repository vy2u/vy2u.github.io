stated alright so today it is day 10 of
15 AIDS Foundation where I test out a
new foundation every single day for 15
days feel like I looked a little bit
bald right now but stay 10 it's Saturday
I really don't care I wanted to make a
couple quick 15 years the foundation
announcements I know you guys have seen
10 days of this series already but when
I'm filming this right now it's actually
only day 3 and I've just been
overwhelmed by your guys's support for
project we do share and the ebay sale
and a t-shirts I think you to all of you
have gotten those when I'm filming this
today between the ebay sale and the
t-shirts you guys have raised over
$8,000 for project be a share so that's
just amazing let's keep it going
I think we can shoe for $10,000 so if
you haven't purchased a t-shirt yet 100%
of the proceeds go to project B to share
so the link for it will be down below
they read oh fam we got this
so the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
foundation has been another one of those
that you guys have been asking about for
years literally and every summer gotten
around to making a video on it I have a
few old videos talking about it and
using it and basically my thoughts on it
in the past I've been that I don't like
using it alone but I do like mix it in
with products and I said that it did
control my oil really well and I didn't
have to powder my face with it have
combination skin I do get oily by the
end of the night so anything that's oil
controlling I typically like mixing it
with other products I've reviews on both
of the other two popular L'Oreal
foundations the pro glow and a total
cover foundation long story short I'm
not a fan of either of those at all
let's go online and read some of the
claims about this things this product
retails for $12.99 and you get one fluid
ounce of product it comes in 12 shades I
both of the shades 101 classic ivory
which is a lighter shade and also 102
shell beige you guys will see what shade
I go with in how I apply them in the
demo but I'm going to start swatches
right here so you can see how both of
these shades compare to some of the
other lightest foundation Shea
that I own alright since watch time
right here is the L'Oreal infallible Pro
matte foundation in the shade 101 next
over is the same foundation in the shade
102 as you can see this is about five
James darker I do not know how this is
the second lightest shade this is the
Lancome custom foundation which I did a
review on yesterday derma called 2:08
pur cosmetics paradol foundation in
porcelain tart reinforces C and
porcelain Urban Decay Naked skin
foundation in 0.5 an Ulta says it's a
24-hour foundation that has air light
texture with the Demi matte finish the
super gliding mattifying formula has
high water content for maximum comfort
that lasts contains shine 2/5 blotting
spheres that act like blotting paper
instantly absorbing sweat and oil
without deserving color pigments medium
coverage so I've actually gone through
an entire bottle of this foundation the
shade 101 which is an accomplishment for
me because I never finish up entire
foundations just because I test out so
many different products all the time so
mixing this with the elf acne fighting
foundation is what I used to do but
that's everything that it says let's
just go put on makeup if you're enjoying
15 days of foundation don't forget to
give this video a thumbs up if you want
to see my thoughts on the L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte foundation and how
to apply somewhere throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching
alright so it is 8:49 in the morning
change in my background for all those
who thought my screen was cracked
there's just black marble so I've
already washed moisturized and primed my
face using the Laura Mercier foundation
primer that I'm using every day in this
series so I've just used 101 and 102
here you guys will have already seen
swatches but I actually haven't swatched
102 shell beige before or used it
obviously so I'm just going to put a
tiny bit out of each and see which one
matches better I might even mix the two
together if any - okay 102 definitely
looks too dark
101 looks too light yes I'm going to mix
the two shades okay so that's looking
like a good shade so on this side of my
face I'm gonna start out with my ELF
brush and on the other side we'll use a
sponge feels very smooth blending out I
think I've worn this product alone in
years I think I could have gone a little
bit lighter on the mixing so I'm just
going to add in a tiny bit more 101
because you can't see a line right there
with the brush I got about medium
coverage I don't love how it's sitting
on
my forehead it's kind of emphasizing
some of my texture up here and also a
little bit around this area but I'm
going to use a sponge on the other side
and see how it goes looks like about the
same kind of coverage to me on both
sides maybe a tiny bit lighter coverage
with the sponge there still acne and
freckles and everything coming through
I'm not going to do a full second layer
but mainly just on this area so I can
see if it builds and covers up some acne
I am way closer to the 101 shade so I'm
just mixing in like a dab of the 102
shade I don't feel like it's building a
whole lot as far as the texture it
doesn't look bad building it up but I
like it better on just one layer so I'm
actually going to skip out on this side
I think because just didn't add any
coverage there's not really a point so I
would say solid medium coverage if you
have acne you'll probably want to go in
and spot conceal which I think I am
going to do because I'm going places
today actually let's just do that now
one of my favorite concealers to spot
conceal with is the wet and wild
celebrity come correct you need the
tiniest bit of this and it is like full
coverage man so I'm just putting this on
any of the spots okay it's drying down
really quick on top of this foundation
so here's what it looks like with pretty
much one layer of the foundation as you
can see spots are still coming through
it I would say it's kind of natural
medium coverage I'm not loving the way
that it's sitting on my forehead I have
some dry patches up here but it doesn't
look bad on my forehead I just feel like
I have other foundations that sit a
little bit better up there everywhere
else is looking good
typically I like a little bit more
coverage than this so I'm not going to
powder my face today because I've never
had to in the past even when I mix this
in with other products right now it's
904 let's just call the second time nine
o'clock I'm going to apply the rest
night makeup and I'll be right back okay
so it's now 9:25 and I kind of have the
same feelings as when I used to wear
this alone it's just not my cup of tea
alone on my forehead is just not quite
as smooth as I like and I definitely
have much more acne and stuff coming
through than I typically do but I am
really curious to see how this wears
throughout the day and if I get oily or
not I don't think I might try mixing the
101 shade with the dermablend smooth
liquid camo foundation because that one
has a super pretty dewy skin like finish
and it is dark and this one is light and
has a matte finish so that might be a
good combo my only critique with the
actual foundation right now is that my
concealer when
weird on top of this it just looks a bit
dry and I actually had to majorly blend
wear my concealer met the foundation
with the sponge it almost just stuck
there and didn't want to blend out it's
just an application the way this goes on
and how it looks I definitely prefer the
pro matte over the pro glow and the
total cover foundation so on the rest of
my face I use math baby don't glow as a
bronzer so blush a is wet and wild in a
purple haze I don't even know if they
still make this I think they do
Physicians Formula shimmer brick and
natural need one of my favorite
highlights I just was super basic on the
makeup today nothing exciting at all
because it's Saturday I was going
through staying with wear age and then
going to be editing video I use the BH
Cosmetics liquid lipstick and Sandy and
then on top of that I put wet and wild
nudie patooty I love using this lipstick
to kind of lighten other nudes so I
think that's it
the next reckon I do will be a natural
lighting and I'll see you guys in a few
hours
alright so it's now 2 p.m. so
foundations on for 5 hours and this is
kind of crap lighting so there's a
building right in front of us but we
just went through it in very successful
be successful get it together so looking
at the foundation I just feel like it
looks really dry I'm definitely not
loving it by itself what do you think of
it right on the side where your chin is
it like doesn't really cover it
yeah it's not covering anything like
especially on this side yeah and I just
feel like it looks kind of textured on
my forehead so I'll check back in to the
edge of girls night if you can hear this
now at 7:40 so foundations been on for
almost 11 hours I'm wearing my heli a
feature because it just came in the mail
let's take a look at the foundation I
feel like the best word I have to
describe this on my skin alone is kind
of chalky does feel really good like it
feels very lightweight it doesn't feel
like I have anything on but the texture
of it and just like the coverage and
everything I don't know just looks kind
of chalky on my skin but for almost 11
hours my oil has held up really well I
mean I pretty much have no oil on my
forehead right now assuming it then yeah
like this is very very very minimal for
me a lot of berries and around my nose
area it does look really good
I love the lasting power on this thing I
just think it's not quite there yet for
me for
I personally like doesn't going to mix
this in with other foundations just I
can get the other kind of factors that I
look for an update you in the wrap-up
video what I think of it mixing it if
you're oily and you like more light to
medium coverage and one sentence is
honestly more on the light side you have
issues with your foundation staying on
you might like this one if you have dry
skin I would say this one is a no-go
give more mature skin but you do get a
little bit oily you might like this
because it didn't really settle in to
any of my lines up here or on my upper
lip or anywhere where I usually crease
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you did make sure you give it a thumbs
up so I know I'm actually going out
tonight and not being a grandma for once
so here we go so I love you guys thanks
for watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
