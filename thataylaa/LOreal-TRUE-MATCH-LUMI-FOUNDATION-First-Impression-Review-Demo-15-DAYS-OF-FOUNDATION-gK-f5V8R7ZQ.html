14 a 15 days of foundation this is where
I've been trying out a new foundation
every single day for 15 days I have four
other seasons of this series so I'm
gonna link those down below but today
we're trying out a throwback drugstore
foundation this is the L'Oreal True
Match Lumi healthy luminous makeup so
this is one of those products sometimes
I'll do these in foundation Fridays and
stuff where it's a foundation that I've
tried years and years and years ago I
don't really remember what I think of it
and also my skin has changed a lot in
the last six months I'm now dry before
accutane I was very oily and how to acne
so it's been fun to kind of try products
I've used in the past and see how they
are on my skin now I haven't used this
foundation I mean I don't even remember
it's been at least I want to say for
years probably closer to like five or
six years since I last use this I love
trying out products like this that just
remind me of like old school youtube
back in the day I remember when this
product launched just I'm curious to see
how it works out for me now comment down
below if you still use this foundation
or your thoughts on it let me know down
below so foundation retails for about
1199 depending on where you get it and
it has one fluid ounce products it has a
medium coverage and a luminous finish it
actually has 40% water for all-day
hydration okay let's do this it has
antioxidants vitamin C and E vitamin C
is good for helping with like scarring
and pigmentation stuff and E is good for
moisture so I'm into both those as an
instant luminous glow lightweight
buildable coverage that lasts up to
eight hours so that's not very long
lasting power right there eight hours I
would say would not last the average
person I do ten hour wear test because I
feel like that's a decent amount of time
but time you wake up go to work come
home take off your makeup bow see how it
holds up it comes in 15 shades warm
neutral and cool undertones I have this
one two soft ivory which is the lightest
of the neutral undertone so I'm gonna
serve swatches here so you can see how
this shade compares to True Match the
regular one which I also have a video on
just a regular True Match and also some
of my other foundations so you can see
how all of them compare let's just
tooling that into my head okay
swatch time right here's the L'Oreal
True Match Lumi foundation in the shade
neutral and 1/2 the lightest neutral
shade next over is the l'oreal true
match foundation not lumi just the
regular one in n1w 1 and C 1
there's derma called 2:08 L'Oreal
infallible Pro glow and 2:01 and CYO
life proof and 101 so there's only one
day left we are trying to raise $20,000
for project baby share in this series if
you're new here make sure you watch the
announcement video it talks all about
what we're doing right now when I'm
filming this it's day 6 and we're almost
to $9,000 so we still have a ways to go
but it's only day 6 so I'm excited to
see where we're at when this video goes
up but I'm gonna pin a comment so you
can see what the current running total
is and also I've been posting on all my
social medias updating guys almost every
day with where we're at let's get to
20,000 I think we can do it last day
here we go link is down below if you
want to check out the shop it's right at
the top of the description box you can
also vote one time a day for the shelter
that you want to win $5,000 and I'm also
going to be doing a meet-up in that city
if you're excited for day 14 don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up if
you're new here you can join the burrito
family and subscribe L'Oreal True Match
Lumi foundation here we go
they 14 folks it is 846 in the morning
you know the drill at this point I've
already washed moisturize and prepped my
skin we're gonna do half with a brush
half of the Real Techniques sponge and a
bunch of you guys I can't remember which
day it was in said that you also felt
like the Real Techniques sponge has
changed they tweeted back saying it
hasn't but I don't know man let's shake
this upside the shade and one it looks
like it might be a bit dark but we'll
see so it says lightweight buildable
coverage I'm gonna start with a brush on
the side of my face
oh it smells like it smells like baby
wipes ooh lookin nice
this is one that as you're blending it
you can kind of feel it starting to set
which I like it doesn't feel as slippery
as when I first put on this has an
interesting scent though it's reminded
me of something that looks really pretty
I actually got a little bit better
coverage than I was picturing off of
that first layer with a brush I would
say I'm at low medium coverage right now
doesn't look the best on my forehead but
it also doesn't look bad if I'm gonna go
ahead and smooth it out with a sponge
afterwards with that same amount of
product the sponge went way less far
with it but I put the same amount of
product out both times one pump and I'm
already through that pump with sponge
just on this part my face so it does go
further with the brush looks really
pretty though the finish of it so I'm
bringing the sponge over oh yeah
finish with the sponge looks beautiful
with this one very hard for you guys to
tell on camera but the shade is about a
shade too dark because the undertone is
neutral though it doesn't look too dark
I think what they have my concealer and
stuff on this would be I mean still
gonna look dark but it's not to the
point where it's not wearable like this
I think the coverage actually looks
pretty similar brush and sponge side
with this one I like the finish better
on the sponge side so I'm gonna try and
build this up since it's supposed to be
buildable
just on the areas where I need it right
here this is where I have scarring
freckles and stuff it's not clinging
anywhere so far and it looks really nice
and smooth looks like a dewy finish for
sure that looks nice this is a news
right now that just built really well I
would say high medium coverage right now
this side actually looks like full
coverage this side I can still see some
stuff coming through so maybe if you
want the most coverage brush first layer
sponge then second layer my forehead
looks great it looks a little bit makeup
beyond my upper lip and I didn't put two
layers here anything or around my nose
cuz that's usually where I get some
cakiness but it doesn't look bad it just
looks a little bit makeup ewwww
but it's looking really pretty overall I
love the
shove it it does still feel a little bit
tacky right now so that's alright now I
think I'm gonna lightly powder this part
of my face right now it's 9 o'clock I'm
gonna do my makeup I think I want to do
like an intense smoky eye so I'll be
right back it is almost 10 o'clock but
check-in time is 9:10 so as I was doing
the rest of my makeup I did powder this
part of my face using the Sephora
microcement Potter love this powder I
just did a whole video on my favourite
powders to set foundation so if you're
wondering why I don't use a translucent
powder a loose powder just watch that
video it explains all about it that's
what I used to set this part of my face
and then as I was doing the rest of my
makeup I notice it kind of starting to
look heavy and definitely creasing ready
on my forehead so I kind of smoothed it
out with a sponge a couple times but
this part where my hair has been
touching my face is like completely
rubbing off so I am gonna set just this
part of my forehead I don't like setting
the center because I'm going to take the
same micro smooth powder and just set my
hairline area so that when it touches
against it it's not gonna hopefully
totally rub off and do this side too
from what I can see on camera this shade
and how it's sitting on my skin actually
looks really pretty so I feel like this
is one I would wear probably on camera
so if you're looking for one that looks
good I don't know if you're into video
or whatever maybe you're a news anchor
or something who knows actually comment
down below is anyone a news anchor
that'd be really interesting or like on
TV or in the news so here's what the
foundation looks like in natural
lighting when I look up close it looks
really good on this half of my face it's
just my forehead where it looks like a
little a little much but it still looks
nice and here's the flash test looks
pretty good in flash I would definitely
wear this one but on the rest of my face
for bronzer you use the same one I've
been using the bare minerals their pro
foundation powder but in 0-5 I'm just
loving the shade for like a natural
bronzer I use the Maybelline fit me
blush this is actually the first time I
think I've used these blushes I'm pretty
sure but this is in the shade coral and
this is really pretty
blend it out easily at the shade of its
not too coral actually it almost looks a
little bit more pink for a highlight I
actually took the NARS free Sol blush I
mentioned this in my last race in
rejects video I love this as a blush if
I use it with just a blush brush I love
it as a glowy blush or I'll use the
Sigma f15 let's do a fibre one if I want
it as like a blush topper and then I
I want it as a highlighter I'll go to
the Sigma fo 3 and this just kind of
transforms it into a super pretty light
pink highlight that still looks really
natural and pretty and doesn't emphasize
my texture so I just love this product
if you like a pink glowy blush or a pink
highlight for eyeshadows I tried out the
lorac pro 3 palette again is this number
3 - I use this for the dark blue kind of
looked the other day and I wanted to see
if this was what was irritating my eyes
and if I was still getting a lot of
thought with it so I just went in with a
lot of the grays and blacks in here and
then I put the silver shade all over my
lids but then the glitter that you guys
are seeing in this like light kind of
mint green this new BH Cosmetics diamond
Dazzlers these are like loose foiled
pigments they're more like glitter
they're called foiled pigments but I
mean they're glitter this is in the
shade precious up this was gonna be like
a gray kind of gunmetal color but it's
actually more light green to apply to
just braid my brush with mac fix+ and
then when i'm with this and just kind of
packed it on flashes are my current
favorites the i'll or accents in 0:05
for lips I put this Maybelline liner in
110 purely nude I put this liner all
over my lips and then it just went right
over it with this 432 liquid lipstick
and I really like this shade for like a
pinky nude light pink nude oh and then I
tried out new brow things I tried out
this brow stylist boost and set by
L'Oreal and this has such a cool wand I
love this applicator for brows because
look how tiny it is you can get right
where you want it and it really does set
those hairs this isn't one that you
can't feel like I can feel the kind of
the crunchiness on this one and then I
went over it with the clear one just on
the front to like brush up some of those
hairs and that is everything everything
I use on my face is always listed down
below along with earrings shirt any kind
of jewelry everything's down below in
the description box I'll see you guys in
a few hours the natural lighting for the
next check-in is about 3 o'clock so it's
been on for almost 6 hours I don't know
what's with this lorac palette I love
the eye shadows when I put them on it's
happened last time too but I'm getting
fallout on the lower lash line again
both times I've worn this now I've
gotten fallout on the lower lash line
it's almost turned into like a satin
matte finish I would say my forehead
still has a little bit of glow to it but
when you really look at it it definitely
looks more like
satin matte right now I'm getting a lot
of creasing right on the center and it's
definitely making my skin look pretty
textured up here facing on this side a
little bit too here's my chest color you
can see like the orange line right here
do you think it's oxidized about half a
shade but here's what it's looking like
right now we'll see how it holds up in
the next few hours I'll see you guys at
the end of the night
oK we've still got some light out it's
now 707 so it's been on for 10 hours
it's crazy how much better this shape
looks out here then I was just in my
bathroom and I look straight up orange
actually show you guys a clip in a sec
yeah let's just zoom in there in here is
actually a lot closer to what the shade
actually looks like so as you can see
and look in pretty orange it has
oxidized more throughout the day so
that's downfall just looks a little bit
too makeup be I have foundations that
sit a lot better on my skin it seems to
have rubbed off a little bit right here
this is usually where I kind of like
rest my hand right there and it does
look like it's rubbed off a bit dry lips
decide a little bit right there to which
I don't think I even was resting my hand
there I don't know what happened there
but yeah you can definitely just kind of
like see this one but it doesn't look
horrible this might be one that I can
mix with something to make it look good
or just try a different powder with or
something because I don't not like the
actual product I just think it's too
dark and with this powder this combo of
stuff it doesn't look as flawless as it
could look probably so I'm gonna mix
this next time I'll probably do some
kind of primer or something right there
so it doesn't separate hopefully and see
if I can make this one work
but don't love it don't hate it I hope
tomorrow day 15 we can end on a high
note but if you've enjoyed 15 days of
foundation and are excited for at the
last day day 15 tomorrow don't forget to
give this video a thumbs up I love you
guys thanks for watching and see you
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
