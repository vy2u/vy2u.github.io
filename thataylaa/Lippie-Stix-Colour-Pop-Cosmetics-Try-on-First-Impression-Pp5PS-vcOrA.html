these are the colour-pop cosmetics
lippie stix and lip liners they go with
them I have a few videos using the
colour-pop eyeshadows and I'm obsessed
with them they're amazing and they're
super reasonably priced so as soon as I
saw that they were coming out with some
lip products had to get him so I bought
six of each I tried to switch up kind of
the shades and finishes so I could get a
feel for them they come in this super
cute packaging I posted a picture on
Instagram which is the same as my
youtube username if you're not following
me you you should I love the package and
is getting the real toasty in here both
the lip liners and the lipsticks retail
for 5 dollars which is super reasonable
almost too reasonable because it's gonna
backfire on me and I'm gonna want to buy
them all I'm on their website looking at
the colors there are five in the glossy
finish 15 in the satin finish and there
are some really awesome colors just like
a green and a blue one in there and 11
in the matte finish I think they might
have added a couple more colors so they
noticed they have a black shade now
which I need to buy so we'll be trying
on all the colors for you guys so you
can see what they look like on I don't
swatch the lip liners because they are a
perfect match they're basically the
exact same color of the lipsticks except
in lipliner form something I really love
about these is that they have the exact
same name in the lipliner and the pencil
how genius is that you don't have to go
on a hunt to find the right lipliner
for your lipstick they just do it for
you and take the hassle out of that
process the worst thing about these lip
liners is the packaging by the time I
set up my camera and started filming the
caps have literally come off about 10
times if you turn them upside down all
of the caps just fall off nothing for it
to click into place the packaging on the
lipsticks is a lot better because it has
a clip so your cap isn't going anywhere
it's the lip liners really bother me
because I've literally had to pick up
the caps ten times
wearing bitch yet on my lips right now I
am obsessed with it I love the names for
all these colors to go hot in here and I
can't think overall I'm super impressed
with the formula of these and how opaque
they are I think that a lot of these are
just as good as Mac if not better
they smell like Mac and they feel like
Mac but they're not $15 I think there
are super awesome products and at the
price I would recommend that you check
them out so if you want to see how they
apply then you can just keep watching I
go through all of the colors yeah
Sun is doing weird things right now so
hopefully this works just had to close
my window because this guy's like
hardcore arguing with his girlfriend all
right so first shade I'm gonna go for is
called brill's this is a satin finish
I think the lipliner and lipstick are
pretty much identical matches oh I'm not
gonna find the lip liners just because
I'm not going for that precise of an
application right now and I want it
easier to take off since I'm going to be
trying so many
super pigmented these feel so nice going
on it smells kind of like a MAC lipstick
somehow I just dumped it that the way
that this is shaped is just easy to get
in your lips I know don't want to take
this off
let's do bossy this is the perfect matte
red shade I don't know why my eyes are
like crazy watering right now to me this
looks pretty much identical to Ruby whoo
this would be perfect for the pinup
tutorial I'm gonna do it see they're
gonna be the video after this or the
next one after that this definitely
wasn't as smooth to apply as the satin
one was did find that it kind of pulled
but that's I don't say typical with
matte lipsticks but it's more common
with matte lipsticks I really like this
red I feel like this is gonna be my
go-to red shade all right so then I have
a nude shade I probably should have done
this one first holy that was
pigmented looks like this is a little
built in my room I'd been too warm oh
yeah it's melted so here is skimpy this
is a gloss finish feels super good on
feels really creamy I don't know if I
would really call this a gloss finish I
think this is more of like a matte cream
sheen that's what it looks like to me
this is a really nice new color
definitely more on the PG side rather
than a pink nude then I have lbb and
bitch yet these are both mattes and we
just talked about the names these are
great they're both matte dark kind of
red berry colors I'm going to swatch
these first because they look pretty
freakin similar to me
okay now lbv is right here this is
definitely more of a berry color and
then this one over here is bit shy and
it's like a nice deep red color I'm
gonna do bitch at first I think
this this is so pretty this slides on
way easier than boxy or whatever that
red color was it's like a whole new
world this does not feel like bossy did
it always feels super creamy does not
feel like a mat at all doesn't feel
drying I might take back the statement I
said about bossy because I think I like
this one even more
all right we're just gonna ignore the
ratchet application of this because just
need to see the color this is el bebé
this is a matte berry shade this is
perfect for the fall I feel like this is
one of those berry colors that you could
wear during the spring or the fall
depending on the look you're going for
and I've got to move my car I'm risking
getting a parking ticket for you guys
right now
true love this feels super creamy going
on what kind of this this is supposed to
be a matte this doesn't feel or look mad
at all to me all right so here's pitch
it's supposed to be a matte deep brown
color I don't think this looks matte at
all I don't know how I feel about the
brown on fair-skinned let me know what
you guys think down below I do like it
but I kind of feel like a smudge dark
chocolate all over my lips so that was
my kind of first impression and Tryon of
the colour-pop cosmetics lippie stix and
liners let me know down below if you
guys want to see these in the shadow and
shmooze video and we can do that I kind
of want to do a shadow inch mousse with
the brown one pitch because I'm not sure
how I'm going to wear this one what
color eyeshadow would you guys wear with
brown lips love you guys thanks for
watching and see you in my next video
