planning on vlogging but I got a few
packages in the mail that I want to show
you guys and I just ran into a wall I
hand-picked groceries came today and I'm
super excited to open this thing it has
like freezer packs in it so I have to do
it like tonight and put it in the fridge
sorry about the lighting this isn't
Brandon's gonna get it so I have this
huge frickin box here it's basically a
grocery delivery service kind of like
blue apron you get the ingredients and
then they give you three different
recipes well so I usually meal prep on
Sundays for work so I get healthy
throughout the week and like when I get
home all right attempt to fool I believe
I have a link down below where you guys
can get 50% off your first purchase okay
this is like way cuter than I was
picturing so I got the seafood bundle
how freaking cute is this this is great
graphics salmon burgers oh hell yeah
they give you step-by-step instructions
this is really freaking cool I've been
looking for a different meal prep kind
of services because I literally don't
have the time to go grocery shopping I'm
gonna finish putting the rest of the
stuff away but I'm probably gonna be
making these salmon burgers tomorrow
because these look bomb calm so I
totally forgot to film an intro before I
started painting for this blog I decided
today is a good day to get the project
done restain my nightstand and then
paint our little side table thing that's
the clips that you guys are about to see
right now
I am freaking starving I think I'm gonna
make an omelet because I never ate
breakfast
so obviously took out all the drawers
took out my clothes and also took off
the hardware just unscrewed it if you
have a sealant on it or it's glossy or
something you might want to sand it down
first but mine feels totally fine this
so you guys can kind of see what I'm
working with right now so lots of
painting just went down it's you know
the dresser and ended up doing two coats
and then I just put glossy polyurethane
on top I don't know if that was a bad
idea but whatever I painted this table
which I got from Ross because it just
looked weird with our wood and then like
this gray wood table just kind of funky
this is the same light gray that's in my
bedroom this is what my nightstand is
it's the Americana decor chalky and
primitive they still have to put a
sealant on that but these ones are just
drying and I need to eat though Rach is
coming over later and we were gonna make
these salmon burgers from the
hand-picked box I just saw that you have
to refrigerate for at least an hour I
think I'm gonna prep the burgers and
then put them in the refrigerator we'll
just do the final steps together let's
do this ignore the messy kitchen issue
see this thing okay I don't even know if
we have a food processor I wonder if I
can use the magic bullet thank you can
let's look this up oh hell yeah you can
use your magic bullet got these mixing
bowls from Target how freaking cute are
these
okay recording is there an easier way to
remember on skin than I'm doing me his
love you know pound of salmon I'm
guessing this is a crown the Magic
Bullet is frickin amazing I've been
using it every single day for my
smoothies and I frickin love it
watch this the ground Simmons YUM
all right so we are vlogging right now I
just got home from work it's a Thursday
I film some footage I think over the
weekend just luck it's gonna kind of be
like a mix of footage
it's the Thursday before blogger affair
so vlogger fair is on Saturday this
weekend I have like 4 videos I have to
record before then I usually film on
Saturday but obviously that's gonna be
out this week so I think I'm gonna try
and get some filming Diamont tonight and
then Sunday super excited I'm actually
gonna be staying at the Four Seasons
downtown just for like a staycation kind
of thing I'm like super excited I got
some packages so maybe we will open
those for you guys right now and let's
just put you here I just picked up a few
different packages from the PIO box
today and a lot of people have been
asking about my room ignore that mess
but the room is coming together slowly
but surely once my room is totally done
I'm gonna be doing a room tour also
gonna be doing a makeup organization
video and we don't really plan out my
videos but I have like goals for the
month I decided that September is gonna
be my month to get the videos done that
I should have done like years ago so all
of my basic videos like favorite makeup
brushes and just put up my top pale
foundations I think people don't really
realize like those are the videos that
take the most worth because it is a lot
of planning just like thinking through
what you want to make sure that you hit
on my acne video is gonna be going up
this is from Luke see beauty and I'll
leave them down below I came across
their highlighters on Instagram and they
looked freaking beautiful oh yeah here's
the highlighters oh they're so soft I
have no idea where that just went that
was the workout that's literally just
rolled all the way under my bed this one
is in the shade Luna oh yeah we're gonna
have to blow on that but looks pretty oh
hell yeah it's almost like blueish I
know if you guys are seeing the sing the
blue I just dyed my roots last night so
the hair line is looking really oh heck
yeah my two perfumes came
where did these two perfumes from
fragrance net I think I want to be
filming a perfume collection video this
month as well I'm just trying to do all
the basics you know what I'm saying we
have some color pop oh I think these are
new shades of the ultra matte lip I have
to do a review on these so many videos
so little time

highlight a little better and my really
cute hair line right now I think I'm
just gonna film work out
attempt to get my life together to
hopefully start editing tonight - all
right so it is Saturday I'm currently
getting ready for vlogger fair drinking
the coffee super excited so I'm just
gonna do my makeup and then Rach is
actually coming with me so she's gonna
come over here and we might grab some
coffee or something and then head over
to Seattle Center I can't believe was
literally a year ago that we moved here
I went to bloggers they're so weird yeah
hello right can't see
nice the Rachel we are headed out to
blogger fair and ellipse I have
colour-pop trap and eyes are just a
random concoction of morph you look so
dead I was like yeah
subscribers she's blogging as well and
just cool it so in case can I show your
face where'd you get this nice I really
want this
I'm feeling very antisocial right now
but we're gonna go back we're gonna
press their beer right so the range is
trying to get the copy editor sure I
really appreciate how they have a short
person here alright just got back from
vlogger fair I feel like this was
exactly why you guys I did a kind of
shitty job of vlogging at vloggerfair it
was fun it wasn't as big as last year I
feel like if I ran into a few of you
guys so I was really cool which and I
went to eat some pizza and then we got
our nails done like if this doesn't
obviously a neon red orange I kind of
love it not much is going on I'm I have
to edit three videos for the week I get
all my work done today so I don't have
to do anything tomorrow I might actually
film my colourpop lip swatch video right
now I feel like since I'm already ready
I might as well film again I really have
to pee right now but my nails are still
not pee ready the struggle I ordered a
lamp that just came in the mail I'm so
excited we should probably get scissors
I've been looking online for a while for
a lamp I also looked at HomeGoods and
Ross and all that I find one I really
liked you don't know what I like those
from West Elm and it was like $150 for a
fricking lamp I ended up finding one at
world market which I actually really
really like this is just gonna be for a
little side table I'm gonna have a whole
room to her apartment tour coming soon
but things are still not together at all
like that needs to
okay yes uh-oh I have to buy a shame so
this is just the base and then I'll have
to go to Ross or something and get it
hot I kind of love it I liked it it's
not super super gold I have to show you
guys I like I think it'll look good once
the mirrors up and everything this is
kind of what it's looking like so far
think I might actually go to Ross right
now like I go to Ross every single day
just to give you like a sneak peek I
guess this rugged guy is from rugs us a
table I'm freaking obsessed with and
it's from Wayfarer flowers from Hobby
Lobby obviously this plant I got is also
from Wayfarer and then we just put it in
a little rose gold basket ething we

in the mail now and here's our little
coffee cart things yeah impromptu Lemire
