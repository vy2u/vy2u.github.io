do this I'm starting out with wet hair I
just showered obviously and I'm going in
with a smoothing balm I've been taking
this easel on smoothing balm every time
I go to blow-dry my hair and I feel like
it actually really really helps with the
frizziness and just makes my hair feel
so much softer so I'm going in and
putting this in my hair then before I
use any kind of heat I always use a heat
protectant favorite heat protectant has
been the get heated heat protectant I
mentioned this in a favorites video it
smells incredible it smells like perfume
once I comb all that through my hair I
just like to let my hair air dry as long
as possible today I was kind of in a
rush because I was filming this so I
didn't let it dry super long but we're
coming back here's me with semi damp air
and I'm gonna blow dry I have a really
weird method of blow-drying my hair if
you have thick coarse hair you know what
I'm saying but there's like one way to
blow-dry your hair and that's the only
way that works and this is it so this is
what I do it works really well for me I
can actually get my hair super straight
and frizz free when I do it this way I
feel like you Salons hair products are
totally underrated I think these are
amazing definitely recommend them I have
a 50% off code in the downbar below if
you're interested or you can get three
for $15 which basically means it's
drugstore prices which is amazing now
we're going in for the fun part or not
so fun part if your hair challenge like
I am these are the Conair hot rollers
and these are nice because you can
literally just plot them in while you do
your makeup and you don't really have to
think about your hair when I had longer
hair I would use these and it gives you
a really nice just wave so basically you
just heat these babies up wrap them
around there's no real method to this
I'm just literally rolling my hair up
there's two different sizes of rollers
the purple and grey and I'm taking the
purple smaller ones in the front of my
face to frame it and then the gray ones
on the bottom so if you watch Mad Men
I'm kind of going for a mehgan look I
don't really know just more of like a
60s Mad Men vibe she's married to Don
Draper so life can't be too bad right if
you don't watch Mad Men you need to it's
like my favorite show right now I'm a
little behind
I didn't start watching it until like
last month it is great it really
makes me question my grandparents but
it's great for the front section I'm
taking my bangs and I'm rolling this
from the top so I'm grabbing a purple
one and just pushing this upwards if you
have layered hair or it's hard to get
the roller in start from like the middle
of the hair and then just kind of work
your way up now going into makeup I
already have foundation long because
this is gonna be like a five million
minute long video so I'm going in with
brows in this whole makeup look it's
kind of just like a not trying too hard
kind of vibe they all always have their
makeup done but it never looks perfect
Meghan's brows have a little less arch
to them and they're just a little more
straight across so that's what I'm going
for here with this colour-pop brow
pencil all the products I use in this
entire video will be linked down below
I'm going in with some brow gel just to
set them I tried to kind of do this
makeup look a lot faster than I usually
would and just put less effort into it
because that's really how all of their
makeup looks so I'm going with some eye
primer I'm using Mac's painterly
paint-pot
actually it's a soft ochre yeah soft
ochre all over the lid and then I'm
going in with the Kat Von D shade +
light eye palette this is what I'm using
for the entire look I'm taking this
brown tan shade and just plopping this
into the crease doing a little bit of a
cut crease whenever they do have
eyeshadow on it's usually kind of a cut
crease situation especially with Megan
so I'm just creating a line a little bit
above where my crease area usually is
making sure not to curve it down but
just make sure it's kind of straight
across then I'm blending that out with a
brush don't worry if the blending takes
away some of the sharpness I'm going in
with a white shadow next to kind of
create that line again so I'm putting
this all over the lid and just bringing
it right up to that crease area this is
where we want it to look really sharp
and you'll see that the white shadow
just helps to clean that up so I'm
placing this all over the lid nothing
special out of all the characters megan
is the one who usually wears the most
makeup she has some interesting looks
let me tell you just do a Google search
for Megan it's pretty amusing for the
upper lash line to line I'm using just a
black pencil and we're gonna be majorly
smudging this out so I'm putting this
closest to the lash line and then using
an eye shadow
so brush and just blending that out a
ton you're gonna have to blend for like
10 minutes it's all good just keep
blending for the lower lash line I'm
doing the same thing but just on the
outer half of my eye so again fully
blending and she does have a pretty
intense lower lash line when she does
wear makeup so actually later on decided
to go black into the waterline which
you'll see
but first I'm just putting a coat of
mascara on and then we're gonna pop on
some false lashes but before that I
decided we needed a little bit more eye
shadow going on
so I'm putting some eyeliner on the
inner corner and then basically lining
my waterline and then sponging it out
and also just adding some black
eyeshadow to the outer V on the top I
noticed that Megan never really has like
fully blended eyeshadow so I'm just kind
of putting some black in the outer V and
make sure you making make sure okay
making sure that it's blended enough but
not fully blended so now we're going in
with false lashes so I'm taking the
morphe DW
these are nice I kind of reminded me of
our dell demi whispies it's nice because
the band on these isn't super thick and
they do look pretty natural
so gluing those bad boys on and then I'm
going in with what am i doing next
Oh contour Meghan's cheekbones are
actually pretty high so I'm actually
taking this brush and drawing my contour
on higher than my cheekbone actually is
it's okay if this looks like a line
right now that's what I'm shooting for
then we're gonna go in and blend it out
so I'm taking the it cosmetics my
sculpted face palette for this one of my
favorite contour palettes if not my
favorite I'm actually taking a pretty
small brush to blend this out just
because I needed it to be pretty compact
since that contour was on there let me
tell you so now I'm just blending and
you can see my cheekbone appears to be
higher than it actually is now this is
my favorite blush lately this is the
covergirl trublend blush woah
tongue-twister applying this on the
apples of my cheeks and I'm applying
quite a bit they are loving the blush
and madman all the characters always
have a really nice rosy cheek so I'm
just going to town with the blush and
then blending it out with this huge
morphe brush which is amazing now I'm
going in for lips and again with the
lipstick it's never a perfect lipstick
look so I'm starting out with colour-pop
cella and I'm just dabbing this on not
fully swiping it just to get a little
bit of the color and then using my
finger to blend it out a little bit more
and then I'm going in with Afra
kathleenlights Miami fever this is a
liquid lipstick so you literally just
need a dot of this I just wanted to get
a little bit more of an orange e tone
going so that's what we're doing here
and again don't fully swipe it just
blend it out with your finger so it
looks a little bit Messier gotta have
the pearl earrings you know it's madman
now I'm taking out my rollers and first
I'm just taking them all out and then
we're gonna play around with it add a
couple more curls and just see what we
can get out of these things so the good
thing about rollers is it actually curls
it downward which is what we want for
Megan's look so I'm taking everything
out and I actually think we could have
left it like right here look at that
that looks pretty madman right there
probably could have just left it like
that but I didn't so good ideas Taylor
so I'm just playing around I'm using my
bombay hair curler which I'll link down
below I'm attempting to create pin curls
here so when we take the curling one out
you want to make sure you stick your
finger in there and actually hold that
shape and then pin it so we're gonna let
these curls set and just do a few of
these around my head for bangs megan has
these like combed over side bangs so I'm
just adding a few more curls and then
actually separating the bangs out and
I'm teasing a little bit first my hair
does not hold to tease at all so if you
have thinner hair this will be a lot
easier for you but I'm just teasing just
to get some volume there and then
combing it over my hair so thick that I
actually had to pin back my bangs and
sections Bobby pinning that back and
then taking the second half of the bangs
and doing the same thing if your bangs
aren't holding you can do some hairspray
in between these steps everyone's hair
is different and everyone's hair curls
differently so you're not gonna get a
perfect curl every single time so I'm
just taking this out and kind of working
with what we got with pin curls you'll
want to softly brush them out and you'll
see that when you do this they kind of
weirdly curl the way that you want them
- it kind of just loops around so doing
this repeatedly across my head and
here's me dress break put on them dress
and now I can't move my arms so life's
great so since my hair doesn't hold at
ease I'm going in for the back section
teasing and then actually pinning that
tease and combing it into a little bump
I guess and then hair spraying the crap
out of this this is a good way to fake
that volume if you're like me and your
hair doesn't hold it tease so with this
section I wanted like a super pin curl
look so I'm kind of pinning this and
then I'm gonna hairspray it I wanted it
to hold like that didn't really work out
I don't think I had strong enough hold
hairspray wasn't exactly what I was
thinking it's all good now I'm taking
this on the bright side
spray Bayou salon this is a color
illuminating spray and this just makes
your hair look super shiny and healthy
spraying that all over also a 50% off
for that so this is it if you guys liked
