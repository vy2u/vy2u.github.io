have not seen done before kind of like a
challenge video my thing is going you
guys want to see other people do this
you can tag them on social media and
things but I was walking through Fred
Meijer and somehow I ended up going
through the magazine aisle and I don't
think I've been in a magazine aisle in
like literally five years so as I was
passing all the magazines I thought it
might be a fun challenge video to
basically take a magazine I picked vogue
here we've got some reaction flip to a
page completely randomly and have to
create a makeup look using only the
colors on that page have no idea how
this is gonna go I picked a vogue
because I thought they might have some
cool like artsy kind of photos I've done
Amazon Alexa orders my makeup post mates
orders my makeup so now we're kind of
going back in time here with an actual
paper magazine they still make these I'm
gonna like old school YouTube tag it up
down below I feel like no one actually
tags people anymore in challenge videos
but I'm gonna leave a few down below
that I want to see so if you're excited
and you like this video idea don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up if
you're new here you can join the burrito
family and subscribe I upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. save time
so I have a little bit of self tanner on
right now just like a gradual tanner and
I already have my base on my foundation
and my brows just to get things going
here so here we go I am just going to
randomly flip I haven't looked through
this at all so we'll see what happens
only can you use colors on the page that
I flipped to for this whole look lips
cheeks everything
wish me luck here here we go
oh we have some leopard print and then
this gal over here all right this I can
work with you got some cool like mustard
yellow tones in here the pop of blue
some red some zebra boots over here yes
there's a lot of patterns happening here
so the added challenge is I only have
about three eyeshadow palettes out right
now cuz the rest of my stuff is tacked
so I will kind of pop this up on the
screen as I'm going just so you guys can
see where I'm pulling colors from think
the two palettes I'm going to use I
should have all the bright colors
covered in this palette I've never tried
this one before makeup revolution
revolution Pro and then the violet Voss
Nicole can see Leo palette there are
some pops of color in here but also this
shade has kind of like the tones in that
leopard dress kind of like the
brown shade and then also just some
camels and like tan colors and stuff and
the shade which looks pretty similar to
that girl's shirt right first thing I'm
gonna do is take the shade Daisy in this
palette this actually looks like their
skin tone I'm gonna do blush and bronzer
and everything last because I have no
idea where this look is gonna go right
now okay I'm gonna take the shade Mars
which is that red shade and I'm gonna
put this into the crease ooh that is
pigmented that almost looks a bit more
Orange II so I'm probably gonna add the
red shade in the makeup revolution one
yeah this looks pretty Orange II before
I go in with the darker red shade I'm
gonna blend that out a bit so like I
said I haven't tried this palette at all
yet hopefully it's good I'm gonna go
with the shade half time
this looks pretty powdery put that in
kind of right where I put that same
other shade okay this one looks more red
there we go ooh it's a pretty red I
might do a halo yeah I'm gonna bring
this all the way in I'm gonna do a
little bit of halo eyed today so I'm
basically putting this into my crease
bringing it in and then also kind of
connecting it out here to make like a
half circle so to add to the crease I'm
going to take this shade right here boo
pop this is similar to what's in her
leopard II kind of dress is that
actually Leopard yeah looks like leopard
to me at that just a little bit above
that red
that shade in this palette is so pretty
I'm gonna blend it out again using the
same brush as the more PM 511 I don't
want to blend away totally that red so
I'm just trying to lightly blend out the
edges here so I was like color
assortment here I actually feel like I
got a really good page cuz I got a bunch
of neutrals black white and some pops of
color we even have like a light pink on
her lips if I wanted to do a light pink
or like nude kind of lip this brush is
great for halo eyes cuz it has a pointed
tip this is the Sigma e-40 for what am i
doing for the lid here I want to use the
blue I think I want to do a lower
lashline pop of blue this shade Victoria
looks like kind of an orange e-gold
actually these two both look like really
similar to the leopard dress so I might
use both of these for the lid and then
do a pop a blue on the lower lash line I
think that's what I'm gonna do first
let's go in with Victoria on the lid so
I'll probably use my finger afterwards
but first I just want to place it with
the brush so I'm just putting this right
on the center I don't want to pull this
all the way in because I do want the red
still there but I'm gonna bring it all
the way up okay my finger look how much
more eyeshadows pop when you use your
finger it's actually insane and just
right on the center right there I'm
gonna take that lighter shade LA just to
add even a bit more dimension and we
blend that out so just the japanesse
versus 7:24 japonesque brush and I'm
blending out those edges a little bit
there are some deep Browns in the
leopard dress so I think I want to add
some of those into the outer corner so
I'm gonna take this shade chocolate
right on the outside the outer V ish I'm
gonna blend that out after just kind of
placing it down I'm gonna go find a
bright blue eyeliner if I can wish me
luck success I'm gonna put on color pop
beasting so this is obviously the color
of her whatever that thing is
her dress under her 10 layers of dresses
this is why I do makeup not fashion
I'm gonna bring this a little bit
underneath as well I am gonna use that
blue eyeshadow so now let's go in with
the blue shade crusade this matte blue
shade right here hoping this is a good
pigmented blue I'm not quite alright not
a fan of that blue shade it almost looks
like chalky or something I'm gonna go
back on the eyeliner deepen that up
there we go look how short my ponytail
is now I think I'm gonna go in with a
light gold shade probably shade up the
light yellow purse that the leopard lady
is wearing looks like Zozo in here is
pretty close to that it's just like a
lighter gold kind of shade I'm pretty
sure I've tried that shade on my inner
corner before and it wasn't light enough
but I think with this look we might be
good there's a little bit more use your
finger so there is white and black on
those shoes and a black flat thing so I
can use some black eyeliner hell yeah
I feel like we need a real real wing for
this look since it is pretty bold okay
I'm gonna put on some mascara I'm gonna
do false lashes but first I'm just gonna
do a thin coat of mascara
well that's drying let's do might the
rest of my face makeup some bronzer
blush and highlight there is a light
pink shade on her lips the girl with the
blue eye shadow I guess are both wearing
blue eye shadow the one leopard dress so
I do have some pink options for blush so
I'm just first going with bronzer I'm
gonna go on the G way bronzer duo this
is the light to medium one and I'm
taking the darker shade in there so I
think actually want to use this for like
a shimmery kind of light pink blush this
you can use totally just as a base
highlight too but if you like a Chloe
blush this does the job so for a face
highlight since I do have that white in
the boots I'm gonna take the same exact
thing I just used but just go in with
the white shade now in here and then
just apply this right to the top of my
cheekbones you still get kind of like a
pinky highlight actually want a little
bit more for a face highlight so I'm
gonna go with the white shade in the
Physicians Formula shimmer break right
right just to get it to really puff
there we go
I'm gonna do lips laughs so let's first
go in with false lashes these are the
kiss but why but why but wha I'm gonna
pop these on and listen to a podcast
well the lash glue dries alright so my
lashes are on now I just went in with
some bottom lash mascara - I think if I
do like an orange II red like in her
scarf thing or whatever that is shirt
scarf think of I do that for the lips I
feel like it'll just look kind of like
clowny so I think I'm gonna do a like
pinkish nude with a lipstick that the
leopard dress girls wearing so this
shade looks pretty similar this is the
bear honey by flower beauty I was gonna
go in with the pop Beauty one but I
smelt it again and I it literally smells
exactly like the dental office let's try
this one I might mix another shade in if
this is too dark or something
okay it's pretty I might add a little
bit of a gloss yeah
I'm add a little bit of my Mui baby pink
just to make it a little bit closer to
hers and lighten it up a little bit
alright so this is the final magazine
inspired look thanks for the inspiration
ladies it was good hanging out she looks
like she's having a lot of fun right now
and Breanna always a pleasure
I don't think I would have on my own
paired all these together but I feel
like they work so I feel like that was
kind of cool I don't usually like get
color inspiration from magazines and
stuff I don't know where I actually
usually get probably Instagram or just
looking at the colors and like just
thinking what would look good together
but I don't think I would have come up
with this exact combination without the
magazine so that's kind of cool maybe I
should do this more often let me know if
