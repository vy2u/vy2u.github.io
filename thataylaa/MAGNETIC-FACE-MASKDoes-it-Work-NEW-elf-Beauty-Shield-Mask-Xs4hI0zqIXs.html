figured what better time than now to try
out this magnetic face mask got my
oatmeal it's kind of growing on me maybe
this is the new elf beauty shield
recharging magnetic mask it so basically
you're supposed to put the mask on your
face and then this magnetic tool it's
what's like peel it off my camera
completely crapped out on me yesterday
so I'm on a new camera right now but
because this is the first time with me
filming on this camera I wasn't used to
the microphone jack and I wasn't pushing
all the way so sound quality for the
application part of the video is super
super quiet so I'm just going to put on
music and like what's called put
captions on the screen so you guys can
hear everything
I'm refilling the intro right now but I
didn't want to refill in the entire
video since it is the first impression I
wanted you guys to see my actual
response and reaction to it
I wanted to refill in this part so we
still have good sound quality for the
first half of the video I should eat
this before turn cold just not good just
picture myself eating a donut right now
but let's hop on the website and read
some of the claims about this map this
is a very blending box right now feel
like you need like sunglasses so
something that I thought was super
shocking is that this product retails
for $24 this is elf cosmetics I think
this is their most expensive product $24
for elf is very pricy that's pretty much
the price of some high-end face masks
but maybe this has some kind of
different technology that warrants the
high price point basically in here you
get the actual face mask and then you
get twenty little magnetic covers for
this one that's supposed to peel off the
face mask says the mask has powerful
magnetic properties key antioxidants
like carrot seed oil sunflower seed oil
vitamin C vitamin E and argan oil hope
this isn't going to break me out
supposed to minimize the appearance of
pores skin is left feeling soft and
recharged very smooth makeup ready
canvas so those are all the claims we
will see if this thing works so we're
going to hop into the application and
the crappy sound I'm going to make the
music the same level audio as this intro
so you don't have to adjust your audio
wherever you're listening to this since
you barely can hear my voice anyways but
let's jump into it
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
