Friday and it is the ultimate foundation
wear test I don't think I've ever done
one to this degree this is why I try out
a new foundation every single Friday on
my channel six p-m tip time so it is
6:30 7:00 in the morning right now my
family is actually in town visiting
Seattle and we're going out on a hot tub
boat which is the coolest friggin thing
it's also supposed to be like 70 today
so things are gonna get pretty pretty
heated I thought it would be the perfect
day to try out this guy this is the
Catrice prime and fine makeup
transforming waterproof drops these are
actually really interesting because not
only are they supposed to make your
makeup waterproof but it also says you
can just use it for wedding special
events basically any time you just want
your makeup to last even better
throughout the day so I'm really curious
if this is gonna hold up throughout the
hot tub oh it gets hot in that thing
last time I was like really really
sweating on also you can get this for
$7.99 it's actually on sale for $5.99
when I'm filming this right now
it also says you only need one two three
drops to transform any liquid foundation
into a waterproof formula so I've got my
swimsuit on right now got my waterproof
cameras ready I'm gonna do half my face
with the drops mix it into the
foundation and the other half not so we
can see if there's any kind of
difference the very side of her
foundation Friday don't forget to give
this video a thumbs up if you're new
here you can join the Bay radio family
and subscribe I upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. system here we
go
all aboard alright so when I was
thinking about what foundation to mix
this in with for this video I wanted
something that a lot of people have
tried that I've tried for a long time
that I know how it wears throughout the
day and especially like in water and
heat and that also has SPF so into on
the it cosmetics EC illumination cream
this is one of my favorite CC creams but
it's not the most long-lasting doesn't
hold up in general super well throughout
the day so I figure this would be the
perfect product to try this with I have
this shade fair here but this one is
almost empty so if I can squeeze enough
out of this shade I'm gonna use fair
light is too dark for me but I might
have to do some mixing wow I haven't had
a single sip of coffee yet what am i
doing my mom and grandma have no idea
I'm filming this today so they're gonna
be unexpected camera women sounds like
pretty thick there's not actually a
dropper it's just a squeeze tube I
already squirted and
right there so I'm just gonna do like
little P's all right there we go I think
we have our three drops in there I'm at
maybe just a tiny bit more just in case
I know mixes it's not supposed to change
the color the formula anything like it's
supposed to look exactly the same I
totally forgot we're doing half I avoid
too much product here let's make this
side waterproof and then this side the
normal so I'm just gonna go in yeah I
got way too much product so if you're
confused and still trying to figure out
what the heck of Hot Tub boat is I feel
you that was me when I first heard about
it's actually so freaking cool if you're
in the Seattle area you're visiting or
something or you're coming for a special
occasion highly recommend going and
splitting it with like four or six
people it goes out on Lake Union which
just has the best view of like the city
and Fremont gasworks Park by the way I
do have an SPF on my face right now but
that's it I didn't put any primer or
anything else I just have my SPF on I'm
gonna link them down below it's the
coolest thing ever
and I feel like it's actually pretty
good to do year-round it's almost better
to do it and like a little bit cooler
weather because then you don't get super
hot and just go super slow and it moves
and you're in a hot tub pretty sure I
can use concealer anything today
if I wasn't filming this video I
wouldn't be wearing any makeup in a hot
tub boat and if someone's gonna comment
about that just testing it for this
video to see if it's waterproof and how
it holds up and everything so this is
the side with the makeup transforming
drops this is a clean brush and there's
also like no foundation on it right now
so I'm just gonna use the same brush for
the other side feels totally dry doesn't
feel like there's gonna be any kind of
transfer of the product on their face is
gonna be just the normal stuff it looks
like it's the same shade on the palette
off the bat I feel like this is looking
a lot more glowy like I feel like it
almost mattified this a tiny bit so I
looks good it just looks a little bit
more matte this shade is a little bit
dark for me but it can work so I don't
know if I'm gonna do a whole like dunk
situation or if I would just want to see
how it holds up through like the steam
and the major heat and stuff we'll see
oh yeah totally more dewy it would be
kind of cool to see how this would hold
up if you are someone who wanted to wear
this like for swimming or something in
the summer for the center right here
just go over it I'm gonna take the
waterproof version oops that was a lot
okay I'm just gonna spread it over to
the waterproof side over here waterproof
over here I actually kind of prefer the
way the waterproof side
looking alright I guess I'll just do the
rest of my face with you guys really
quick not gonna do concealer I'm pretty
sure I'm just gonna do brows maybe a
little bit of blush or something if
you're looking for something that is
actually waterproof for your brows for
the summer look no further
yeah decided I feel like actually looks
a bit better I almost added like a tiny
bit of coverage or something not a
liquid highlight or cream blush person
but I wonder if you were if you could
mix it in with that too
probably I also wonder how this would do
mixed in with primers for highlight I'm
gonna take this one by Velata and
Smashbox and I was gonna kind of tap
this on the high points since I didn't
set my face it even feels different on
this side going on it feels like this is
actually like whoa way more set so this
one feels pretty tacky and sticky like
that cosmetics CC usually does this one
definitely feels more set we're going to
take a tiny bit of their cosmetics by
BAE pours bronzer I've been feeling this
bronzer lately it's kind of warm up my
face and I think that's all I'm gonna do
today again definitely seems to be
blending easier on top of this side
keeping in mind didn't set this with a
powder but didn't say either side with
the powder so 7 right now we go out on
the boat at 9 o'clock so it'll have a
couple hours to kind of chill on my face
so see you guys in a couple hours on the
hot tub boat
okay it's been on for about in two and a
half hours now I'm full and sweating
right now so we'll see
do you think there's a difference
between this side and do you think
there's a difference between the right
side and left side at all just which
side staying I'm better this side that's
the water for fun that's pretty crazy
that you can see you're blushing and yet
this one looks like from what I can see
right now it's super bright this side
looks like it's on butter yeah you guys
will be able to see this side but we're
sweat and we've only been on this thing
for like a half-hour
all right so now it's three o'clock
lookin pretty ratchet that's been on for
about eight hours at this point so I was
looking at it throughout the day I did a
check in on the boat and then you guys
saw the last check and I just did which
I just got some clips of was a couple
hours ago before we were heading out for
lunch this is the side without mixed in
this is a side mixed in and obviously
both are like worn off a little bit in
certain areas it was a really friggin
hot did add a little bit eyeliner before
lunch but definitely still rubbed off in
certain areas here but just overall and
definitely in the first two hours I
think this side did actually hold up
better than the side without I mean this
side is rubbed off a lot more it looks
like especially on my cheek area not a
giant difference on the forehead but
everywhere else I think overall this
side looks a bit better about my hair is
in like one giant jacuzzi dread right
now is it like a super drastic
difference not with this foundation but
also keep in mind this was like really
putting it to the test I did not dunk
under the water but I mean I was
sweating water was getting on my face
obviously these certain foundations that
you mix it in with are probably gonna
work better but I would totally just mix
in a couple drops of this with another
foundation especially if I know that I'm
gonna be outside in the heat and I just
want to give my foundation like a little
bit more lasting power I mean I do think
you did a little bit of something I'm
actually gonna try this again tomorrow
and I'm gonna insert another clip at the
end of this but I'm not gonna do a full
sit-down and apply it but I'm just gonna
try it with another foundation and see
how it holds up throughout the day so I
can just show you guys kind of another
mixing product so I'm gonna wear this
tomorrow and I'll see you guys then okay
so it's actually the following week not
gonna get into it here but long story
short it's been a pretty rough week
between multiple things might talk about
stuff more in a shadowing schmooze but
basically right now it's actually
nighttime and it's the first time in a
few days that I've been like functioning
and can film so I tried out the Catrice
drops again this time I mixed it in with
the milk makeup blur liquid foundation
kind of my thoughts at this point is
that this does feel like it does
something to the foundation in a good
way I can't put my finger on it it
doesn't make it necessarily thicker but
it gives it a little bit more of like a
gel texture but it definitely sets it
more so this foundation the milk makeup
blur liquid I have a whole other video
a bunch of videos using this for this
when I had oily skin this with the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
loose powder that was one of my favorite
combinations I have a whole video on
that routine it was the makeup for
photography video but this foundation I
really like now that my skin is drier it
does look different doctor doesn't look
quite as dewy which is interesting it
looked more dewy like right off the bat
just on first application not even after
a full day wearing it when I had oily
skin so it does look a little bit
different on my dry skin now but I still
like it
and today mix in with the Catrice drops
I felt like it definitely set more than
usually usually with this foundation
it's pretty tacky like you definitely
have to set it with the powder and I was
still able to blend powder products on
top we got look at highlight I could
blend stuff on top of it and it does
feel like it's definitely set down more
than usual it almost gives it like a
booster these are supposed to be
waterproof drops I am gonna go in the
bathroom right now and we're gonna see
if this is totally waterproof I'm like
splash water in my face so let's go
can't wait we're in the bathroom
lighting by the way I didn't put on any
concealer or anything today because I
literally am just wearing makeup today
for this video for you guys I feel like
it's rubbed off a bit on my hairline
actually and it's really hot today in
Seattle and my apartment it feels like
it's about 75
okay I'm gonna give this a second to
kind of air dry off and then I might try
just patting dry no makeups coming off
on here but I can see it is a dark gray
detail I can't see any makeup coming off
on here hmm oh yeah okay
definitely come off in certain areas
oh it's getting like progressively
should be Reza's drying so just off in
that little water dip right there I
don't know if I would say this is gonna
like completely make your foundation
waterproof like I said I do think it is
kind of just more of like a booster so
if you need something to help make your
makeup last a little bit longer if it's
super hot or humid by your whatever in
the summer or all year round you could
just add in a couple drops of this I do
feel like it does a little something so
I'm going to keep using this I think for
making your foundation just last a
little bit longer I give it a thumbs up
for making it total waterproof I don't
think though I do think for about 6
bucks or 7 bucks it could be worth it
give me a go I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and the whole wear test and
everything so if you did don't forget to
