this video for a few different reasons
this isn't just going to be a makeup
declutter video I had this kind of
realization a few months ago that I have
this platform which is awesome and I
feel like I'm not doing feel like I
could be doing so much more with it I
feel like I try to do stuff in my own
life that helps out other people or the
community to a certain degree but I've
never really talked about that with you
guys so my good friend on YouTube
Kendall Rae we were texting about this a
couple months ago and she was like dude
I literally feel the same exact way
right now I've been trying to think of
some way to do something and like help
out so we wanted to clap on this video
and just encourage you guys to go
through your stuff declutter it feels so
good go through your closet go through
your shoes go through your makeup which
I'm going to talk about because I think
a lot of people don't realize that you
can actually donate your makeup whether
it's used or not I'm a Link Kendall's
video down below so you guys can go
check out her video Kendall and I are
gonna see how this goes and then hoping
to do something like bigger for the
holidays if you have any ideas for us
let me know down below but I just feel
like it's time to use my platform for
more than talking about makeup I love
makeup I'm super passionate about it I
love talking about skin confidence it'll
talks a lot about body confidence and I
know those things make a difference to a
certain degree but there are just so
many freaking issues in the world and
when you have a platform like this and
don't talk about any of them it just
feels wrong there are even ten people
that are watching this and decide to do
the same thing then that's making a
difference even though it's super small
since I moved to Seattle over the last
two years I've been donating to an
organization called youth care do a ton
of makeup sent to me from different
brands in PR and whenever I go through
the packages I'll kind of like set aside
stuff that I want to try out and then
I'll put some of it in a box either for
a giveaway for you guys or to donate go
through my makeup probably every month
every month and a half and donate a huge
bag to Youth Care which is a homeless
youth shelter here in Seattle and I
think a lot of people don't realize that
whether your makeup is used or not used
all of those things can be helpful for
people that literally
have nothing I think a lot of people
think with makeup it's different but you
can donate your makeup and your shower
items or shampoos whatever it is to a
ton of different shelters and
organizations close to you if you just
call up your local women's shelter or
you shelter a lot of the places except
make up donations I found out by youth
care because my best friend Rachel who
you guys probably know if you've watched
my channel for a while Rachel works at
youth care and she has for the last two
years since we moved here to Seattle so
obviously give her everything to donate
and we show rage in a second to talk a
little bit more about just how you guys
can help out anywhere where you live
there are places like youth care doing
the exact same thing that I'm sure would
be super grateful for any kind of
clothes makeup whatever kind of
donations that you can give it's
something that's so minor to us but can
literally change on Wednesday or week or
month these are kids who a lot of times
have been in extremely messed-up
situations with family members abuse are
sex trafficked and so whether is clothes
or makeup whatever you have laying
around the house anything helps people
out so I wanted to bring Rach on
that she goes through is just so far out
from what some of us know it's just so
important to step outside of what you're
doing every day and realize that thank
God there are people like Rachel put
themselves through that and care about
the work they do and actually genuinely
want to make the world a better place
and not just say that but they actually
spend every day working towards that I
just think Rache is amazing I think what
she does is amazing just major props to
anyone in that situation looking good
I ready all right so here is Rach so
we're just going to talk about her
experience working with different kinds
of youth she's not allowed to say a lot
of the stuff that I think would actually
be interesting but basically I'm just
gonna let rage talk about whatever she's
feeling I think like one of the first
questions people have about like a
homeless youth shelter is like where do
they come from
 happens to really lovely children
and like really lovely people all the
time something happens it's good to have
a safety net about what ages do you
usually work with 12 to 17 so it's kind
of a wide range developmentally and have
someone who is not used to brushing
their teeth every day and another person
who's working on like drug and alcohol
so even super basic stuff like
toothbrushes or deodorant like a lot of
these kids don't know how to apply
deodorant or like how to actually bathe
themselves so those kinds of things that
we just like don't even think about a
lot of them have like never actually use
that at all back to the like where do
these kids come from hammering again we
get kids that were involved in the
juvenile justice system kids in foster
care and then kids with major family
conflict I feel like donations are super
important but just like being giving of
your time could also be helpful I think
a lot of homeless shelters have places
where you can be serving food or just
spending time with people so even if you
don't have like material items to donate
there's other ways that you can get
involved if you want to that being said
if you don't have the time we all in the
United States a lot of us certainly have
the resources and we throw away an
immense amount of clothes hygiene
supplies anything that you've ever
looked at ordered and been like I didn't
really want this but I'm not going to
return it don't throw it away there's
someone who definitely needs a shampoo
right now I think it's hard to
appreciate like when your life gets
turned upside down by domestic violence
when you have to upper yourself
completely
or when you're homeless and you don't
have a lot of resources all the little
tiny things that it takes to make
yourself presentable again to be able to
do an interview to get a job to sit in a
restaurant without being a legs out all
of these things like are so important
for people and helping them get
I just back together and that's so true
and just even like we think of it as
like makeup is excessive or like that's
not something that someone really needs
but if you're women and you're trying to
get a job like having a nice shirt and
putting on some blush or whatever it is
like all those things that help like
with things that actually matter in a
very real sense I feel like it's
unfortunately kind of a survival tool a
way of getting them to the next step to
being able to come through a door
without being kicked out or looked at
like what does it's almost an doing in
our nice establishment though mentally
speaking teenagers are super concerned
with their appearance and the effect of
being homeless has on them bouncing from
place to place a lot of times they don't
have a lot of stuff vrooming yourself
it's like so calming it's so important
to being a teenager and like gaining
confidence if you think about like what
your life would have been like if you
just got a pimple and just had to deal
with it there was no one to show you how
to do your hair to cut it it's really
hard it really takes a hit on these kids
self-esteem just like seeing our girls
sometimes open makeup see them be able
to get a haircut for the first time and
then they're just like beaming it's like
it's great it's wonderful that's all you
want for a teenager is for them to be
like happy and healthy and taking care
of themselves and feeling good your
supplies means so much more than you can
know so just check in your areas and see
what places you can donate to and just
to clarify my earlier point if you're
going to be donating use make up a lot
of places either have to like accept it
pre sanitized and you can like sanitize
it at home but just check with the
specific shelter that you're interested
in donating to I typically donate gently
used like stuff that just likes wash so
that's kind of how I go around that but
there's definitely places that I feel
like would accept just totally like use
makeup and then others that probably
have more strict rules thank you Rach
you're so welcome awesome it's so cool
that Taylor's talking about this I hope
that gave you guys kind of some insight
into what Rachel does and what probably
a lot of organizations similar to that
do if you decide to do this and donate
some of your makeup or clothes tweet me
snap me or are tons of different
shelters across the country in every
city I'd love to see if any of you guys
actually do this so let's get into the
decluttering go grab a glass of wine
I feel like watching people get rid of

weirdly satisfying kind of like washing
clean with me videos I just feel like I
did it even though my apartment is still
a hot mess alright so hopefully this
lighting is OK just played around with
it for like 20 minutes and this was the
best I could get it so I would start
with the second drawer just because I
feel like this is the most overwhelming
look at all these lip products who needs
this many lip products I don't draw is
just a total show I think I'm gonna
have to rearrange some of this stuff and
put it in this drawer I don't have a
whole lot in here because I usually put
all of my receipts right here I just
keep boxes of stuff that I'm not sure if
I'm going to keep or return yet and then
some random leftover lip products but I
have a ton of room right here to put
more lip products that I need to
rearrange some of this stuff so let's
just start I'm gonna start with the
stuff that I know we want I love my over
liquid lipsticks and B hue I'm going to
put a little stuff I want to keep for
sure in this baggie and then I can
rearrange afterwards so I have a NYX
lingerie liquid lipstick here this is in
lace detail I want to try these out
again because I've heard they have some
good lighter nude shades Stila stay all
day liquid lipstick so some of my
favorite
so all of these are dollar liquid
lipsticks from eBay that I got to do
like a swatch video on just never got
around to it so I'm going to set these
aside in my to fill makeup pile okay so
if I'm not doing a very good job getting
rid of stuff so these are all of the
minis and I keep these two nude ones and
then donate these three and container
down these are a bunch of the new juicy
shakers and I think I'm only going to
keep like two shades of these I just
feel like I'm not going to reach for
these that often I did a giveaway on
Twitter with a ton of the shades I think
I'm going to keep this nude one and then
this like reddish shade so let's get rid
of these three so these are actually all
doubles of the maybelline vivid matte
liquids I have all of them in my
container over here eyeball them myself
and they actually sent a PR package with
them so I'm going to donate all of these
few of the shades of the Urban Decay
vice I think is about the Vice lipsticks
I just don't use lipstick lipstick so
much anymore unless they're like nudes
if it's a red I'll just reach for a
liquid lipstick this brown shade
conspiracy is super pretty though I
think I've won this on Instagram I feel
like this is unique show you so I'm
going to keep that and I'm also going to
keep naked which is a new shade Kat Von
D keeping that whoa I totally forgot
about this brand this is what happens I
like the position is in here this one
that looks like it's totally separated
this is three witches this was like one
of the first liquid lipstick brands I
feel like that really got popular on
Instagram I feel like it's memorabilia
now but this is definitely toast so I'm
going to throw this away what totally
didn't even realize I had this I
remember buying this this is Anastasia
Beverly Hills midnight so I'm going to
keep the amore matte lip cream in a door
and I'm going to donate this red one so
I have a bunch of these la splash liquid
lipsticks I actually love these I don't
think I'm going to reach for these to
close very often so I'm going to donate
these this lipstick and inflamed LA
slash is one of my favorite red liquid
lipsticks I also just wanted to say no
one needs this much makeup at all I
understand this is extremely excessive
but YouTube is a job for me and so a lot
of these products I keep to test out so
I have a bunch of new products to try
out in different videos this one is
brand-new this is sephora liquid
lipstick I'm going to keep this for
giveaway donating all of these I just
feel like I'm never going to wear these
I'm going to donate these and then
what we narrowed down the liquid
lipsticks to
these are basically just random colors
darks and then it goes into reds down
here and then these are all shades of
nude basically this is gonna be tricky
so many freakin colour-pop lippie stix
they're ultra satin lips and they're
liquid lipsticks they aren't even in
here they have their own drawer and this
other puppy over there so I'm going to
try and separate some of the stuff out
and get rid of some if I feel like I
have a lot of similar shades so I'm
going to keep time square and deeper and
then donate these two instead of having
all color pop in here I think I'm
actually going to have all nude
lipsticks like all of these and then all
darker and colored lipsticks in here I'm
going to donate all of these I feel like
I'm not going to reach for these enough
donating these make up forever pro
sculpting lips want to keep this one red
shade and then donate everything else so
this right here is basically all
lipstick lipsticks I don't think there's
any real rhyme or reason to this it
started out as only drugstore and then I
ended up just like throwing everything
in here so I'm just going to go through
these keep the colored ones in here and
then put the nudes in here I'm gonna
donate these five pure lip lures whoa
macaroon lippies who remembers when
these came out I think I actually have a
swatch video of all these I'm gonna get
rid of this l'oreal infallible glass I
just never really reach for super
pigmented glosses i just prefer a liquid
lipstick that's not going to budge this
is the cutest thing I've ever seen this
is a mini bite lipstick I'm getting rid
of most of these bright colored Milani
Mac I love the formula of Milani matte
Revlon lip butters do they even make
these anymore could I sell this on eBay
this is creme brulee this reminds me of
when I first started youtube these are
some mini julep lipsticks and then some
more Milani I'm gonna donate all these
if that is all those I'm keeping I feel
like it did a really good job clearing
that one out now on to this monstrosity
I definitely think I need to put my lip
liners in a cup or something I just
realized I have another extra of my
marble brush holders so I'm totally
gonna use this for lip liner so I'm
going to keep all of the Urban Decay lip
liners that I have these are all jcat
Rock rashik waterproof gel lip liners I
haven't given these a shot yet so I'm
gonna put those all in my cups so what
the cups looking like there are so many
colourpop lip liners in here it's
ridiculous I'm going to go through and
pick one of the similar shade and then
get rid of all the other ones except the
nudes because I feel like I always need
nudes
so I'm going to donate all of these
colour-pop I love the formula colourpop
lip liners they're some of my favorite
lip liners these are just all very
similar shades and I feel like I picked
out a few that I will actually wear this
one smells ridiculously of coconut like
too much this is a Pacifica lipstick so
I'm going to donate this one and I'm
also going to donate another Loreal Pro
matte gloss next mauve this is a classic
so I'm donating all these Ofra lip
liners not that into the formula of
these they're pretty stiff and they drag
a little bit keeping these urban decay
gwen stefani because this packaging is
beautiful by the way this whole time I'm
putting away some stuff for family and
friends this cup is getting full so I
need to narrow these down donating these
to definitely keeping my essence lip
liners I love these these are a jcat
waterproof I think I like these I'm
going to keep just this lighter shade
Palladio herbal liner this is like
throwing it back to college I used to
wear this all the time this is
blackberry I only have a few Mac liners
in here this one was like my all-time
favorite this is staunchly stylish I
don't even know if they make this
anymore but I love the color of this I'm
going to give this Mac liner to a friend
and then donate this one pretty good we
got all of them to fit in this container
another julep below I don't know how I
ended up with like five of these keep
this one for a giveaway since it's still
in the box these are all the makeup
forever new artist artiste rouge cream
I'm going to keep the nude one I haven't
been super into the colored lipsticks
like I said ooh that blue shade is
pretty cool I'm going to keep this dark
blue this was a collaboration with Icona
pop so I kind of want to keep this I'm
gonna donate these two these are both
glossy lips I think I'm gonna end up
putting the glossy lips and here maybe
who knows right now I'm gonna put them
in here this is a freaking sweet color
I'm going to keep this color this is the
J Kat soft matte lip cooler I'm donating
all of these and all the J cat wonder
lip paints these are kind of cool if you
do really crazy lip art or some things
but I would just never reach for these
they transfer majorly
I'm gonna keep this white one because
that might come in handy then actually
switch out of these containers because I
have way more mats than I do colors I
feel like by the way these things I got
from a container store here in Seattle
but you can give use up pretty much any
organizing store so I feel like that's
way better I have all my news here and
and then all the Reds and other shades
of lipstick back here now we've got this
guy I've been loving the wet and wild
color icon lip glosses these are super
nice not sticky matt baer used to be one
of my favorite nudes this is a lipstick
by Jordana these are really nice
formulas the modern matte lipstick so
I'm going to keep that the Milani
brilliant shine lip gloss this is the
shade bearer secret this is another
super pretty nude gloss I'm gonna donate
a couple of the drug cosmetics glosses
just because I don't wear these shades
Roselle was super pretty though I'm
going to keep her in so donating these
so Mac RiRi gloss here get the shade
matte innocent also really of this one
then I'm going to donate all these
donating all these alright I'm going to
open this drawer and just go through
this because it's pretty much a mixture
of gloss and color pop this is one of my
favorite lip glosses you super sticky
this is NYC 467 pleasantly plump love
this one a bunch of Too Faced melted
under here I totally forgot about I'm
going to keep these because I feel like
I these the same shades I have some
doubles here so I'm going to give these
two menus to a friend and I keep melted
nude and keep melted peony
this one looks super pretty I'm going to
keep this then I'm going to donate these
two this is a mascara don't know what
that's doing in there so I'm going to
donate these for I'm going to donate all
these la glaze lip paints I'm just never
going to wear these these are more
metallics I guess I'll just put with lip
gloss
maybe alright so this is now what the
lipstick drawer looks like I do have a
ton of other lipsticks in this other
cube thing to my left but as far as the
drawer this is all of my lipsticks now
it feels so good to be able to kind of
see everything more and not have
cluttered around the outside I'm going
to show you guys the box of stuff we're
donating this took way longer than I was
anticipating so I'm actually going to be
doing a second part to the declutter
video where I go through if you have my
other drawers if you guys want to see it
let me know if you do down below and
don't forget to give this video a thumbs
up so this is the box there's so much
 in here this goes down
five thousand layers but this is all the
lip products and a few other random
products that I cleaned out earlier that
I'm going to be done in youth care so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I know
that this is just something that is
super small but again if we can make any
kind of small impact together as the
Boehner Ito family then I think it's
worth giving it a go
love you guys thanks for watching see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
