Friday this is where I do a new first
impression video every single Friday on
my channel 6 p.m. Pacific time next week
there's actually not going to be a
foundation Friday because it's going to
be the 15 days of foundation
announcement video where basically I'm
talking about what we're doing this
project CD share and the whole series so
next Friday's when you guys will hear
everything about 15 days of foundation
which starts April 5th and goes to the
19th so I tweeted you guys asking which
foundations you want to see in videos
coming up and one of the main ones was
the makeup for ever matte velvet plus
foundation which is actually an old
foundation been around for years now and
when I actually started YouTube it was
kind of a cult favorite foundation and
it's just on this product so I've never
gotten around to trying out for some
reason so it's going to weigh into this
in 15 days of foundation but I was in
Sephora I never actually walked into
Sephora I always order online this was
one of those foundations that I had
absolutely zero idea what shade I was
going to be sending up getting two
shades in just a sample cup so I don't
have the actual bottle to show you guys
but it is a very basic squeeze to bottle
exactly like the elf acne siding
foundation whenever I do foundation
videos I always purchase the actual
foundation just so you can talk about
the packaging and all that since I was
there and I don't know what shade I am I
figured I might as well just try out
sample cups so let's jump into the
claims on Sephora's website the
foundation retails for $41 and you get
one point zero one ounces of product
pretty much one fluid ounce this comes
in 21 shades so nice shade range the
lightest shade is number 15 alabaster it
says for porcelain skin with pink
undertones that one didn't sound like it
was going to match me and the lady in
Sephora agreed this I got samples of
shade 20 and 25 you guys will see in the
demo which one ended up working for me
but 20 says ivory for light skin with
beige under 10 under 2 and under Jones
there we go 25 says for light skin with
pink undertones
I have seen swatches of shades 15
alabaster and I'm kind of kicking myself
that it didn't also get a sample of that
one so I could swatch it for you guys
but if you google makeup for matte
velvet plus shade 15 there's tons of
swatches that come up but I'm going to
search swatches right now as these two
shades compared to some of the other
foundations that I own or to make up
forever matte velvet plus fun
the shade 20 next over is it in the
shade 25 and by the time i've swatched
these they've already oxidized next over
is targeting force to the sea in the
shade porcelain then we have pure
cosmetics bare at all in the shade
porcelain and derma called 2:08 so
there's a really brief description which
I appreciate to the point it says this a
shine controlling oil-free
water-resistant complete coverage liquid
foundation that literally sounds like
everything that I want in my life I have
combinations can I get pretty oily so
anything that says shine controlling
sign me up I'm into it since I have
cystic acne I also like more high
coverage so as it hides imperfections
evens out skin tones and mattifies it's
a non oily perfectly powder finish
that's four out of five stars on Sephora
with six thousand reviews so that's
pretty good like is that this one's been
around for a long time so those are all
the claims Thank You makeup forever for
not rambling on about five thousand
things that are unnecessary if you are
new here you can join the burrito family
and subscribe episode of welcome you
should definitely subscribe I upload
Monday Wednesday Fridays 6 p.m. Pacific
time don't forget to give this video a
thumbs up if you're excited for
foundation Friday if you want to see how
to make up forever matte velvet plus
foundation apply somewhere throughout
the day you're in the right place just
keep watching not feeling quite like a
human being it needs more coffee it
looks like a freaking jungle in here
right now
ok so I think I'm going to start out
with the shade 20 and see how that one
goes I haven't watched them yet or
anything come on girl in Sephora
she didn't hook this sister out very
well so if you've seen any of my more
recent foundation videos I typically
used the jouer anti blemish matte primer
and every single video I am completely
out of it and I'm trying to find a
different primer that I like so I think
well I'm on the hunt for a good new
primer I'm just going to not use a
primer that I have washed and moisturize
my face like normal let me go in with a
brush on one side of my face this is the
morphe 31 and then a Beauty Blender on
the other side she's going to put about
a dime-size amount on a palette and a
wife Deborah tried this before
oh good coverage really good coverage
that was like not even half that amount
either it's sitting really nice on my
skin looks satin matte but it doesn't
look heavy at all and I think the shade
match is pretty good you look at my neck
down here it might be a tiny tiny bit
darker but I mean it definitely works
lately I don't know why but I've been
kind of leaning towards more matte
foundations for the most part they've
just been holding up a little bit better
on my skin if you like the pur cosmetics
paradol foundation with my like
transition into the matte world in case
you see how this applies with the Beauty
Blender because I think it might apply
better on my forehead with a Beauty
Blender I have some dryness going on on
my forehead actually not clinging
horribly when I've been putting on
foundation in the past few days it has
just been completely clinging to the
dryness up here in comparison to that
this one looks pretty good up there so
it is clinging a tiny tiny bit for half
my face I still haven't gone through
that dime sized amount I put out so
that's really good because I usually use
a shit-ton foundation so you guys can't
hear my watcher drop the kid I was
wearing a more few liquid lipstick
yesterday and when I rubbed it on my
lips were stained fuchsia and I have not
been able to fully get it off I've used
oil makeup removers three times a shower
and I've scrubbed them lip scrub so damn
morphe what are you putting in there
it's applying totally fine with the
Beauty Blender who would that just moved
out the forehead really well yeah the
center of my forehead now is looking
good okay starting to feel like I've
been missing out my entire life I feel
like I got maybe a tiny bit less
coverage on this side with the Beauty
Blender both sides look really good
right now there isn't a huge difference
between the Beauty Blender and the brush
side I'm just going to go over with a
Beauty Blender some of my more pigmented
spots and acne to see if I can
completely cover it up oh yeah okay so
this is buildable you have acne or
rosacea or anything this is covering it
on my skin to give you a coverage
comparison definitely not quite as full
coverage as Marc Jacobs remarkable order
McCall's at all but pretty doing good
coverage I've been missing this pretty
much in lately for the amount of texture
and dryness on my forehead right now and
this being a more matte foundation it's
sitting really nicely on my skin I'm
liking this you guys so right now has no
complaints which is rare so it is
exactly 10:30 right now I'm not sure if
I want to powder my face I'm going to do
the
my makeup and kind of decide feels like
it's setting down to kind of a powdery
finish which is nice for blending stuff
on top and since it is a matte
foundation I kind of just want to see
how it holds up throughout the day if I
can avoid using a powder i typically do
i do have combination skin so i get a
little bit oily on my t-zone definitely
just wiped off my nose so i'm going to
the rest of my makeup drink lots of
coffee and i will be right back alright
so the rest of the makeup is on it's now
11:10 had some issues with eyeliner just
kept getting bigger and bigger and
bigger of course I used some new
eyeliners today's it's like the most
waterproof thing on the planet so once
it's on Sun so we can just ignore the
eyeliner situation today but I'm gonna
tell you guys everything that's on the
rest of my face in a second but let's
talk about the foundation I'm going to
call the check-in time 10:30 since
that's when I finish up the foundations
because I didn't end up setting it with
the powder I love the way my skin looks
right now the only thing right now is
that I do think is oxidized it's always
difficult yet you can't even tell on
camera really but there is a line right
here when I went to the bathroom you
could especially see it it kind of
oxidized a bit already so I'm hoping it
just stays like this throughout the day
and doesn't oxidize more if it oxidizes
more I'll definitely have to mix in a
little bit of the lighter shade with
this around my nose and my pores is
looking nice and smooth yeah I'm just
feeling it at this point so on the rest
of my face I use this beauty tree it's a
contour palette that I mentioned in the
hoola light bronzer video I use these
two shades right here there's kind of
more reddish one in the tan one and just
mix them for blush I use this one from
Daiso I think by the time this video is
going up you guys will have already seen
it but I did a full face using
dollar-fifty makeup from Daiso I wanted
to test out this blush again to see what
I think of it and I'm not super
impressed and then highlight this was
intense this is the J Kat you glow girl
baked tyler.durand 104 crystal sand
absolutely love the Bella Rose shade
this one looks a bit more glittery flash
textured to me I also use this on my lid
as eyeshadow for the rest of my
eyeshadows I use the cool tone purple
shades in the Urban Decay Naked palette
eyeliner was also from the dye so video
the LFR i water-resistant very very
water resistant I might add and then
lips is this for liquid lipstick in the
shade 33 I love these liquid lipsticks
these will definitely be in my March
raids and rejects so 1030 check-in time
I'm going to set my check-in alarm next
reckon idea will be a natural lighting
so we'll see you guys in a few hours
3:45 so everything's been on for a
little bit over five hours and it looks
good when I was looking in the bathroom
mirror I like how it looks it looks
really good at natural lighting the
color always looks off for some reason I
was hoping my vlog camera was going to
come today and I checked the mail just
now it wasn't here yet so one more time
on the iPhone hopefully and then the
vlog camera will be here for check-ins
but it's looking really good on my upper
lip my forehead looks amazing to me no
major creasing around the nose or
anything yet the color does look off for
me hopefully you guys can tell them I
sliding now but looking at it compared
to my neck it's definitely oxidized and
is too dark so I think next time if I go
a shade down or mix in a bit of a
lighter shade hopefully that'll work by
the time I oxidizes so that's the only
thing I'm not liking with it right now
everything else I'm feeling it's now
11:30 just finished watching the
bachelor finale what the heck I just
want to play with those dogs but I'm 38
so Foundation's been on for over 12
hours 13 hours normally don't keep you
on this lawn but for 13 hours
it looks freakin amazing separating a
tiny bit right there on my forehead but
I think it really any upper lip creasing
around my nose it's breaking down a
little bit but I feel like that's
expected with any foundation for 13
hours I've had foundations look 50 times
worse than this a few hours and so I
think it's actually held up really well
throughout the day considering the only
thing I'm really bummed by is the fact
that oxidized so much I feel like it's
not even showing up so maybe you can see
more there yeah there we go a little bit
it's oxidized a lot actually looking a
lot better on camera right now but my
face looks definitely too dark in real
life like I said the other check and
I'll probably have to get the lightest
shades but I definitely want to purchase
this one because I like coming it looks
throughout the day I like how it held up
pretty much everything except to show
you them feeling and this is a lot of
powder too which is crazy so I love you
guys thanks for watching see my next
