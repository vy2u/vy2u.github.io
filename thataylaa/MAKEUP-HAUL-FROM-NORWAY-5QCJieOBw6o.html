are gonna be doing a haul from my
Iceland Norway trip I just filmed a
video on this look which will be up for
this video so I'll link it down below in
case you missed it did a full makeup
tutorial so in Oslo I was super excited
because I saw that they had a boots
there which I've never been to and turns
out that all of the boots in Oslo or I
literally like mini marts they're
literally like the size of my room and
they have no makeup so awesome
but in H&amp;amp;M it turned out they had a
whole floor of beauty stuff but you have
a lot of same kind of makeup that boots
has and then also just their own hmm
brand which I've never I did one video
trying Asian eye makeup just stuff that
I could find online but they had like
literally an entire makeup section now
I'm the receipt anymore so I'm not sure
of all the prices but I think all this
was equal to about 80 u.s. dollars
pretty much like drugstore prices so I
got the profs proofs professional dry
shampoo it says that refreshes brown
hair and I thought this would be good to
say don't get the like white cast or
whatever the white powdery stuff when
you spare a dry shampoo on dark hair and
I use this the other day and it's the
straight-up like has like the spray
paint thing so that was interesting you
can easily get this like on your clothes
not a huge fan this I feel like I don't
want my hair like transferring onto
things throughout the day I probably
won't use this again it didn't do that
much inspires control the oil and it's
pretty much just like spraying the brown
spray paint for your hair it also smells
terrible it smells like the Tresemme dry
shampoo I think trust me Wednesday award
for the worst feeling dry shampoo so
they had sleek makeup there which I was
super excited about this is the precious
precious metals highlighting palette I
haven't opened this they had little
things just wash about this pretty much
for the white fair shade right here and
that one was all out on the little
swatch palette thing so I'm hoping that
these are powder I think there might be
a couple of creams in here like makeup
is a UK brand and I have a couple of
they're things I think you can actually
order them online
to the u.s. now so that's exactly look
at this packaging that is leaked oh
shoot these totally look like cream this
doesn't go all the way back which is a
little bit annoying like I kind of like
to keep pushing it back let's say
there's three creams and one powder to
watch action look at that light shade
I'm usually not that into creams but
these have kind of like a powdery feel
to them okay I've been on the hunt for a
good deodorant that doesn't leave like
white marks and I can't find one
whoa where's the lid hmm smells good and
it's all over I can't find a good
deodorant in the USA I've tried
literally 30 different deodorants and
all of them either don't work or leave
white marks on my clothes so I figured
out try a few that we don't have here so
this is the Garnier mineral and visit
dry 48-hour no white marks it smells
really good I've also been trying out
the Nevaeh one this is the invisible
antiperspirant deodorant they had a few
different maybe isn't in there yeah
thank you snippy yeah I always do that
every easy just for the past like two
weeks and it does a decent job it
doesn't leave any white marks which is
nice but I feel like the smell control
could be better you know I'm saying I've
got these Invisibles and these are
basically just little hair type things I
remember these from like seventh grade
or something but they're coming back
these are like smaller ones though so
you can basically just use it as a hair
tie and okay that's bad yeah great ideas
Hitler well you do just that and I'm
assuming these don't like break as easy
as normal ponytails so when I thought
that there is gonna be a foots as
watching a bunch of loose halls on
YouTube and people kept mentioning this
this is the Garnier Ambre Solaire Soleil
I went to another makeup store like in a
random mall I don't remember what it was
called but this is where I got that you
guys know I haven't used self-tanner for
years like probably aren't even oh two
years three years haven't touched a
single self-tanner and we'll be going to
Mexico on a cruise in a couple months
and I kind of want to wear self-tanner
I'm just feeling it I don't feel like I
need to wear it self-tanner anymore
I love my pale skin I made a whole video
about it it's just nice to have a little
bit of color sometimes if I'm
be wiring swimsuit it says it's for your
face but I heard that this is good to
use on your hands and feet since it does
have like a spray thing on the down
below if you've watched me sense of self
tanner days then at H&amp;amp;M they had a whole
wall of these which I thought were the
cutest things ever these are basically
like single-use face mags
super good for traveling is you can just
bring this tiny thing you don't have to
bring like the whole tube or a jar of
your face mask and I just got a bunch of
different a bunch of a no little ham got
a ton of these that are falling
everywhere
so this one is liquorice and sugar it
says this is good for oily skin and it
has sweet almond oil this one is coconut
water moisturizing face mask for dry
skin cucumber and a low cooling peel-off
mask with passion flower and lotus
blossom for tired skin
witch hazel cleansing face masks with
rosemary and tea leaf for oily skin
tea tree oil and --which hazel are
really good for acne so I'm excited to
try this one
witch hazel with willow herb don't know
it willow herb is but it says that this
is good for blemish prone skin spearmint
and I'm going to try and pronounce that
okay so I just have a few things left I
got this this is really random I got
this Scholl fresh step shoe deodorant
spray because my flats when I'm wearing
those and it's like hot out you do not
want me to take off my shoes this really
helps you just spray this directly I'm
actually not sure where you're supposed
to directly spray this because there's
no directions in English on here but I'm
pretty sure you're supposed to spray
this directly in your shoe so that's
what I've been doing before and after I
wear at the flats and it does really
help and it actually smells really good
like I would just bring us in my room if
I could then I got this which I totally
didn't need but look at this packaging
I love the mint packaging this is white
tea and peppermint hand cream and I'm
not usually a hand cream person at all
like it usually really bothers me to
have some kind of lotion on my hands but
I put this on in the store for some
reason and it smells so good it smells
like a candy cane mixed with like
vanilla or plum or something it just
makes your hands feel really nice and
moisturized without feeling oily at all
which is what I really like it seems to
like absorb into your skin super fast so
I don't really feel
like I have a hand cream on not
beauty-related but I might as well show
you because these are in the bag
I got these earrings from hmm I got just
for this black pair right here if you've
been watching my channel for a while I
used to have these black earrings that
look like gauges and they are from Old
Navy they're like five bucks
and once those broke I could never find
those again and since then I've been
looking for something similar so I'm
thinking that these might work I also
really like the great ones right here
and then I just got this necklace which
is really random but I thought it was
super pretty so that was everything I
didn't go too crazy if there was a boots
there I definitely would have done Hamm
so it's kind of good that there wasn't
the travel vlog is coming I love you
guys thanks for watching see in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
