all right so today we're doing a full
face one brand look using all essence
makeup essence you can find out alta
there drugstore brand everything is
under ten bucks that I'm using today
which is awesome and they're cruelty
free essence comes out with some of the
best products that they friggin
discontinued every time essence does
have some really great products there's
also a lot of misses in this video that
you guys will see done a few other one
brand tutorials that I'll link down
below I've done one on elf
Katrice I just didn't want kind of
recently what was that Ulta I'll link
those three videos down below but I feel
like one branch oils they're just kind
of a fun way to try out a bunch of
products from the same line at one time
by the way not sponsored by essence
cosmetics I bought all this myself
feeling kind of feisty right now with
the leopard and the fuchsia lip like we
need some Pussycat Dolls playin or
something so if you guys are excited for
this video don't forget to give it a
thumbs up if you're new here while
you're watching you're having a good
time you can join the baby doe family
and subscribe I upload Monday Wednesday
Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time and I just
ran out of the breath so let's get into
it if you want to see how I got this
look using all essence makeup you're in
the right place just keep watching ok so
the lighting might not be quite as good
as the last couple videos because it's
actually straight up pitch-black outside
right now second day after I got back
from the trip and I thought I had be jet
lag yesterday I was doing good and then
I was up until 6:30 a.m. last night so
needless to say it is 8:30 p.m. so have
a shit-ton of vests and stuff to try out
right now most this stuff is like first
impressions - I've used a few of them I
didn't see a face primer but I did find
a setting spray this is the essence keep
it perfect makeup the fixing spray I'm
gonna use this kind of as a primer and a
setting spray just to see test the
mister what the heck is that smell it
smells like grass it has a nice fine
mister but that scent needs some work
so this foundation is gonna be
interesting I only saw 3 shades on the
display is gonna be too dark I can tell
already but hopefully I can make it work
that this is the essence soft touch
mousse makeup this reminds me of the
Maybelline Dream matte mousse which I
have a whole video on all says is a
super delicate mousse texture it gives
your face as smooth the natural looking
matte complexion believe the foundation
was $4.99 it's like super bouncy you can
see the whole thing moving in there
whoa this feels definitely different
than the Maybelline one it feels almost
like a jelly or something I could just
put my finger in here for hours this is
how I imagine when you squeeze boba this
is what I feel like it would feel like
anyways she probably put this on my face
I also got this essence camouflage full
coverage concealer in the shade five
ivory so I'm thinking I might mix in a
little bit of this actually with the
foundation to lighten it and then add
some coverage because I have a feeling
we'll need it I was gonna blend this out
with my ELF blending brush yeah very
light coverage super light coverage but
it's actually it's not sitting on the
skin badly like it's not clinging
anywhere it just looks pretty natural
and I'm gonna add in some of this
concealer so I'm just gonna go in right
on top this concealers both to be full
coverage see how it covers my acne down
here it's one of those annoying
concealer packaging where you actually
don't get a whole lot of product out on
the wand we'll see how that looks under
the eyes but I would definitely not call
that a full coverage concealer my skin
doesn't look bad right now this combo
does not look like the worst thing I've
ever put on my face still a bit dark but
at least the tone is kind of neutral I
don't think either one of these I like
enough to really use again on my face
but I do think it works I tried to blend
that foundation like all the way down
into my shirt all right let's see how
this thing is for under the eyes now how
much was the concealer concealer is 399
I'm just gonna blend this out with my
fingers I think definitely is not full
coverage its brightening because of the
shade but I mean you can still see dark
circles you can see freckles everything
coming through so I only saw one face
powder in the store and it was way too
dark that's one thing I will say about
essence where's your shade range it
might just be the shades they carry in
the US but there is like literally zero
shade range so instead I ended up
getting this color correcting mattifying
powder because my Physicians Formula
correcting powder I find it's actually
pretty lightening so I was thinking
maybe this one will be light enough his
powder was 399 so it kind of swirls to
like a white shade so this might
actually work for underneath the eyes
also got a little creative slash
desperate and picked up the essence the
Velvets eyeshadow and fluffy clouds
which I thought might work also to mix
in if the powder was too dark or just to
use this as like an under eye setting
powder no idea how that would go
I think I'm first gonna try is
correcting powder underneath my eyes I'm
just gonna dab my brush in this
eyeshadow this could go really wrong not
bad I'm gonna go back in with this
correcting powder this is actually
giving like a pretty kind of soft focus
finish kind of like smoothing things out
a little bit I think I would use this
one again and try it out with my normal
foundation because I do feel like it's a
little bit softening or something the
brows I kind of screwed myself over on
this one a little bit because I thought
I had the essence make me brow in dark
brown but I can't find it anywhere I can
only find this shade in blondie Browns
but I got the essence make me brow duo
in zero 1 mix it blonde and I got this
lighter shade because I actually was
planning on using this as a contour
which I still am gonna try but I wasn't
planning on using this on my eyebrows
now this is the only eyebrow product I
have so I'm gonna try this deepest shade
in here for my brows which is probably
gonna be too light but hopefully we can
make it work I also have an eye shadow
palette in there so if I need to I can
go in with one of the darker brown
shades brow powder was 349 okay so I'm
going to dip into this shade right here
I haven't used a brow powder in forever
and half would you like gels or pencils
a lot better I just feel like powder
can't really get as crisp of a line as I
like okay that's definitely too light so
I'm gonna whip out that eye shadow
palette that we're gonna go into again
later for the eyes but I think there's a
dark brown shades this is the essence
shape and shadows eye contouring palette
hell yeah okay we have a definite doable
brown in here so I'm gonna go in with
this shade right here this is Audrey
high brow high brow okay this for your
brows oh there's a brow wax and
everything and there's this bully
okay redo so now what we're gonna do is
I'm gonna dip into the fix wax put that
down first and then go ahead and go in
with that powder I'm putting a wax down
first just makes the powder adhere to it
more that shade is definitely
more up my alley I'm gonna take a little
bit of this darker shade Bridget Brown
right here just for the tail if you like
powder brow products I think those
applied totally fine I like the tone of
them I like the shade this one could
potentially be a good contour as well
it's darker but it's not quite as ashy
as this one which one do I want to try
I'm gonna try the lighter one first this
could look totally grey but let's try
this thing out my MUA eyebrow kit is one
of my favorite contour shades if you
have more fair-skinned going in with an
eyebrow powder can actually sometimes
work really well because the tone is
usually a bit cool toned and light
enough and that one's working I don't
feel like that looks too grey I'm gonna
contour under my lip at this and also
just the tip of my nose okay I like that
Oh to use that again as a contour you
have a product that I want to try kind
of as a bronzer I don't know if this was
technically supposed to be a face powder
it looks more like a bronzer to me but
this is a mosaic compact powder and 0/1
sunkissed beauty by the way this powder
is 449 I have tried the essence bronzer
that was in like the huge pan I think it
was called blonds or something it's
definitely been in a video an older one
I don't knows way to oranjee and warm
for me
ooh oh I think I like that those next
product is a blush that I've used a
shit-ton before this is actually one of
my favorite blushes this is in the shade
20 pinky flow and it's like this ombre
blush hombre I was gonna say ombre ombre
blush they had a different shade at Fred
Meyer I didn't see this pinky one but
I'm 99% sure they still make it if you
like pink tone blushes this one is just
beautiful there's definitely a phase
where I was using this like every day
two of my favorite highlighters ever
happened to be by essence both of which
were discontinued the essence eyes
shadow and zero one snowflake I've
talked about for forever on my channel
now Ulta stopped carrying this I think
you can still get it in other countries
I can't find it online at all in the US
if I can I'll link it down below I know
a bunch of you got this when it was
still available in Ulta this eyeshadow
is freaking beautiful as a face
highlight if you're fair also the shade
0/8 apricot of essence blew me up
shimmer powder so freakin pretty this is
in the
rose it up I believe this is from a
limited-edition collection like a couple
of Springs ago I didn't want to mention
these because if you can find them you
should buy them because they're
beautiful but I don't want to use
something that you guys can't get
anymore so instead I'm gonna use the
highlight shade in here this is
technically I'm thinking supposed to be
like for your eyes or your brow bone but
I just watched it it looks like it might
work as a face highlight I don't think
it's gonna be too glittery or anything
okay I'm gonna add just a tiny bit of
apricot eye cuz I can't help myself it's
right here essence Ulta you guys need to
bring these back this I got super
excited about when I saw it because it
reminds me exactly of Mac's Paint Pot
which I use every single day for an
eyeshadow primer it's like a potted
cream eye primer this is in 0/1 nude
beige I don't put this all over the lid
oh it feels very creamy so super creamy
when it first goes on but it does seem
to be kind of drying down into more of a
powder which is nice I think this was
249 so for eyeshadow I'm just gonna do
kind of like a combo of things mostly
using this palette so this palette was
$9.99 and you get again two eye shadows
it looks like a highlighter two brow
products and the prime vixen wax I'm
actually gonna start out with that same
mosaic powder that we use for a bronzer
I'm gonna swirl and kind of like the
darker shades over here and put that
into the crease it feels so weird
filming right now since I usually film
at like 7:00 in the morning I'm hoping
that'll be tired after this and will
just like pass out so I can get back on
a normal schedule I think I just need to
hit up that night glow you know what I'm
saying actually took my normal like
muscle relaxant last night and that
thing usually knocks me out and I was
still wired for like four hours after I
took that that's when you know jet lag
is real okay now I'm gonna go in with
the Audrey high brow shade technically a
brow powder but it's all good we're just
gonna use it on my eyes - tomato tomahto
now I'm gonna go what was that English
and I'm gonna go into Bridget Brown
right here and just kind of smoke it out
a little bit more whoo
that is intense that one is definitely
more pigmented than the other shade it
looks like there's orange on my brush
but these bristles are just like stained
okay now I think we're gonna go in with
an actual eye shadow I'm gonna take this
metallic shade right here and put that
on my finger to start and put that right
on the center of the lid I want to see
if I can get that to really pop so I'm
just gonna go ahead and wet my brush
with that same setting spray okay much
better ooh that looks pretty I feel like
this looks like prom makeup right now
remember winter formal what would
totally forgot about that comment down
below if you're watching this video and
you're still in high school most of my
audience is a little bit older but
comment down below if you're still in
high school I'm curious I'm gonna go
with the highlighter shade that I used
on my face I'm gonna wet it again and
put this right on the inner corner if
you want a little something extra
definitely what these for the waterline
I'm gonna take the gel eyeliner pencil I
use this the other day in a video this
is just a black liner I'm gonna put this
right on the waterline and then kind of
smoke it out with those Browns again I'm
gonna go back in with the super dark
brown shade right here and kind of
smudge out the black liner a bit
I like this brown shade it's a nice like
deep deep brown when I do this I don't
bring it all the way into my inner
corner on the bottom because that'll
just super close off your eyes I just
bring it in - right about there so I'm
gonna blend out that lower lash line now
with the same mosaic bronzer shade so
it's kind of planning on doing winged
liner because I actually have two
essence eyeliners I have this one which
I haven't tried this is the super
precise eyeliner it says this one has
like a thin little brush applicator this
one was $2.99 and then this one I
already had this as a essence two-in-one
eyeliner pen the thick and thin pretty
sure I used this in a video a long time
ago
and I can't remember what I thought of
it there's like this thicker mark your
side that looks like a felt tip pen and
then there's this end to it I kind of
want to try this like marker thing I
don't think I'm going to do a wing I
kind of just want to run this
on the upper lashes lashline this is
like total prom makeup so I could put a
prom dress on okay so that worked it has
kind of like a rough tip to it I don't
know if I would reach for that end again
this one I'll keep to try out in a
different video maybe a shadow and
schmooze or something or lashes I
already had the essence forbidden volume
usually I wouldn't use whoa this is a
big one I don't know how we're gonna do
lower lashes with this tempted to use my
wet and wild make length but people
murder your firstborn child when you use
a different brand into one brand
tutorial for one thing okay is it
cheating if I use the wand from the
other mascara though I don't think so
I think that's being inventive right cuz
this I know it would just be a disaster
this would be all over my face
got some clumps going on well let that
dry just realize I totally forgot to do
setting spray again I usually like to do
that before I put on any kind of
eyeliner mascara just so it doesn't
cause everything to get wet and like
transfer so I'm just gonna let this all
majorly dry down but let's go in for
lips I love the essence pencil liners
not the retractable ones I haven't tried
the retractable ones yet but the pencil
liner i think is called a lemon in the
nude that's one of my favorite lip
liners ever i haven't tried this this is
in the shade a girls dream and it's like
a twist up and then I'm gonna put this
Matt Matt Matt long-lasting lip gloss
but this is actually like a Velvet Matte
lip not sure why they call it a gloss so
I thought this might be a nice fall kind
of berry combo whoa this is very has a
super fine point
no thin that is I think I've ever used a
lip liner with that fine of a point like
look at how fine that is I could do
freakin drawings on here it's a little
bit more future than I was envisioning
but that's okay the lip liner by the way
was 249 and this is 399 woah big wand on
this thing mmm it smells so good pumpkin
bread maybe it smells a little bit
pumpkin II the color is pretty though
it's nice and opaque and it feels really
kind of just lightweight curious if this
is gonna dry down because it kind of
feels like it's gonna transfer all over
my teeth right now I'm gonna give this a
few minutes to see
this dries down alright so it's been a
few minutes and it definitely has been
transferring onto my teeth I haven't
even been talking I've just been like
taking photos kind of feels like when
those liquid lipsticks that stays like
moosie
but this is the final look using all
essence makeup I think I think I think I
think I think the things I'm most into
at this point are the color correcting
powder I would use this again I'm
curious to see how it looks on top of
foundations that I know how they look on
my skin and everything concealer I would
definitely pass on I would not reach for
this again not a fan this I would
definitely reach for again the mosaic
powder which is technically a face
powder apparently but if you have fair
skin this one I think looks really nice
as a bronzer but also use the eyebrow
product just powder as a contour again
Wednesday it's the most blendable thing
in the world but for a couple bucks the
tone is really nice I would also use
this again the eyeshadow primer I want
to keep trying this out with different
eyeshadows I like how my eyeshadow
turned out the combo of brow products
and eyeshadows I think worked the
foundation is just not something that I
would reach for again it's very light
coverage too dark so everything I can
find online will be linked down below
