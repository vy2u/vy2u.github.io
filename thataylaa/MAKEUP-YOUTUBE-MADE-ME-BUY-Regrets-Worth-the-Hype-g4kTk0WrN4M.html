couple hours ago rocking the makeup on
top of makeup look day to night makeup
that's the thing we'll call it that all
right so today we're going to be talking
about that YouTube made me buy
there is a lot of it I have a giant ass
box right here I've been watching
YouTube for about I want to say eight
years and I totally forgot about this
until my mom brought it up a couple
months ago but I totally started a
YouTube channel in high school made like
two videos and then deleted it and I
didn't actually like start my youtube
channel until I was in college totally
forgot about that I think the name was
like surf and turf or something don't
question your high school self basically
what I'm trying to say is that YouTube
has made me buy a lot of stuff over the
years so some of the products I don't
physically have here because I like to
declutter and donate my makeup every
couple months I just did a whole makeup
declutter video so if you want to see
that process I will link that video down
below if you missed it but we're just
gonna throw it back these are like
product recommendations from years ago a
lot of the super hype dab youtube famous
products so I'm just going to go through
each product talk about what I like
about them what I don't like about them
if I still use them were they worth the
hype all of that good stuff so watch a
few of these videos from other people
and a lot of my products are similar but
I don't know why this one really stands
out to me when I think of YouTube back
in the day and something that I would
have never bought without YouTube and
this is a silly
tanda chanel you two dresses crazy thing
where all rationale goes out the window
and you buy products that are like 10
shades too dark for you actually have
self-tanner on in this video because I'm
coming back from I actually just got off
the plane like two hours ago from
vacation so that's why I'm looking a
little more bronzed than usual but
normally this is orange on me years
ago this used to be the bronzer I
actually got this on glambot a few years
ago because I was never able to or
willing to hash out this much money for
Chanel bronzer so I got it like
half-price on Glee I bought a few years
ago I want to say and I've just
literally used it like twice my entire
life because it's just way too dark for
me I don't know why I bought this next
up is
mary-lou manizer by the balm mine has
gone through some rough times I feel
like this was one of the first
highlighters that really got popular on
YouTube when I first got it I was
obsessed with it because I think it was
the first highlighted ever really owned
actually no this one that I'm going to
show you next I think I've actually had
longer piloting wasn't a thing back when
Mary Lou came out I don't really use
this so much anymore and I know people
are kind of rediscovering this right now
and it is a really nice highlighter just
on my skin tone I don't know I just feel
like it looks a little bit too glittery
I don't know what it is but there's
something about the shade of it on my
skin tone that I don't totally love so I
don't reach for this all too often but
still have it still looking great this
highlight is something that I hundred
percent bought because of Shannon so
back in the day janek's that was one of
the first youtubers that I like got
addicted to and a long time ago she
recommended the gemma kid makeup school
face cream highlight this is in the
shade ice cold and this is still
stunning actually dug into this the
other day because I found it in the back
of my makeup drawer it's a cream
highlight and I usually don't like cream
highlighters too much but this one is
just so pretty if you want kind of a
natural but still intense glow just
gives you as beautiful radiance I
ordered this off of like some UK sight
back in the day let me know if any of
you guys have this down below because I
feel like this is more like a personal
one for me I feel like this was on the
first real YouTube recommendations that
I bought but I don't think this product
is all too popular across the board
Tasha
luminous dewy skin mist I feel like this
is going to be in every single one of
these videos because this is just one of
those products that blew the up and
I really don't think it would be as
popular in the US as it is without
YouTube and social media is basically
like a luminous setting spray so you
spray it all over your face I ended up
getting the travel size because the full
sized bottle this was like 50 bucks or
something for a setting spray it is
glass it's tatcha it's super high-end
but I wasn't willing to like hash that
out on a setting spray so I just got the
travel sized version and I'm really glad
I did because I'm not that into this I
don't get it I really
get the obsession I'm still in the hunt
for a real dewy setting spray the next
duty setting spray doesn't do it for me
do it I don't get that dewy effect it
sets my makeup really nicely I feel like
it does extend the long the long
longevity of my foundation I guess I
find a second spray that really makes me
look super dewy this is definitely
product I regret buying didn't work for
me some people of it steal a kitten this
is one of those cult favorite eyeshadows
highlighter is you can use this for
whatever you want and to me it is
totally worth the hype there's something
about this eyeshadow shade that is
stunning on the eyes as a highlight if
you want a super intense highlight it's
just so freakin pigmented hopefully you
guys can see that there we go
it's just unreal I love this I will
continue to use this glad I bought that
one then I luxury powder IVA shade cameo
right here just so I can hold something
up but the one that I bought because of
YouTube was the banana powder holy
I feel like YouTube made hundreds of
women and men walk around with yellow
under eyes for a while I think it was
kind of like the first yellow powder to
really catch on in the YouTube community
and every skin tone was buying it and
that's definitely one of those powders
that is for a very specific skin tone if
you have pale skinny girl you cannot
pull off wear it banana powder under
your eyes I picked up the shade cameo
because I fell for that trap and I
picked up banana powder like everyone
else on this planet and then I realized
what the heck am i doing so the Cameo
powder works a lot better for my
skintone I am NOT a big fan of loose
powder on my skin which I've learned
over the years
Codey air sluttin powder this is a total
patrick Star recommendations it's
basically just supposed to give an ultra
smooth ultra soft finish to your
foundation you can get this from the
drugstore it's like six bucks and you
get a ton of product in here I have
never actually been able to fully test
this out because it is too dark for my
skin which I'm kind of bummed about
because I really want to know if this
lives up to the hype I'm just gonna
trust Patrick on this one says
translucent extra coverage that's a
little bit contradicting am i right
ladies
ooh I should actually try it now that I
have some tan on me
Mac Paint Pot this is like
a classic soft ocher and painterly those
are the two most popular shades I still
use this almost every time i prime my
eyes I love Mac Paint Pots I don't think
there's been anything better that has
come out to primer eyes I'm a big fan of
them still think you should try this out
if you haven't do it next up is the Kat
Von D shade + light eye palette I
resisted getting the shade in like
contour palette which is also huge on
YouTube because I bought this and I
don't really get it no people are
diehard shade and light palette like
this is their go-to I have just never
really gotten the use out of this I
thought I would the shadows are a little
bit too powdery to me
they're so pigmented and they're so
powdery that I feel like it just kind of
goes all over my eye I like a little bit
of a stiffer eyeshadow I don't get a
whole lot of use out of this at all
I felt like this palette was a little
bit overrated but I do love the
packaging I think the packaging is
beautiful Beauty Blender if you do not
own the Beauty Blender and you watch
YouTube major props to you because that
is some major resisting the urge right
there
YouTube 100% made me buy a freaking
beauty blender which I kind of regret
said this in multiple videos but I'm a
big fan of the Real Techniques miracle
complexion sponge over the Beauty
Blender it's a good sponge to blend out
your makeup but it doesn't give me the
kind of coverage that I like and I think
the real technique one does just as good
of a job and gives me better coverage
and it's literally like six dollars
instead of what is this 25 first plunge
this is the most expensive sponge I will
ever own in my life
hopefully oh we're on kind of the Tools
Sigma brushes this Sigma and morphe a
hundred percent totally YouTube made me
buy these but Sigma brushes were the
first high-end brushes I bought I'm
pretty sure I bought my first Sigma
brush because of Ciao Bella back in the
day I still love her I love her vlogs
she was definitely won the first BT
youtubers I watched and I'm pretty sure
I bought the f80 because of her and then
the collection just grew from there
Sigma is a company that I have never
tried one of the brushes and thought
like why are you selling this the
quality is there I've had the Sigma f80
brush for almost about this freshman
year of college so almost five oh my god
six years the handle has not broke
like some of the more if you wants to
because of cheap glue it doesn't shed
it's still in great condition if you
don't watch YouTube and if you're not
into social media you would have no idea
Sigma existed whenever I tell friends or
family about Sigma they've never heard
of it it's totally a YouTube thing I
wish more people knew about these
because these brushes are freaking
amazing
the products I recommend by the way I'm
going to link in the description box
down below if you want to check anything
out to primers benefit Porefessional and
maybelline baby skin a lot of people at
one point we're saying that these two
are dupes for each other
personally I was a fan of this one I do
think that this helps to minimize your
pores but I'm pretty sure this majorly
breaks me out so I've since stopped
using this I think I stopped using this
like two years ago and it's just been
sitting in my drawer maybelline baby
skin primer was super popular at one
point this one makes me really oily I
don't know what it is but the formula of
it I feel like it's almost too silicone
IAM my makeup just slides the heck off
Physicians Formula butter bronzer this
is a recent blow-up this got really
popular this year I'm pretty sure know
who I think Jacqueline Hill made this
one super popular it looks freakin
amazing on some people on my skin tone
it looks Orange I've seen pale people
pull this off it's just a little bit too
much orange which is weird because when
you just look at it it looks like it's
going to be a nice chocolate like milk
chocolate shade but it just pulls really
orange on my face the formula though is
super pretty blends out flawlessly don't
have to do a whole lot of blending it
just is kind of effortless Urban Decay
primer potion this is another major og
YouTube bag this is when primer wasn't a
thing I'm pretty sure Urban Decay made
one of the only eyeshadow primers this
was definitely one of the first ones on
the market that I'm aware of I think it
was just because it was the only thing
we knew it was like amazing I think the
Mac Paint Pots work a lot better but
also kind of depends on what you like in
a primer this one is much more liquidy
and thinner consistency Mac Paint Pots
are a little bit thicker you're probably
all waiting for this moment to come
YouTube made me by four different naked
palettes I couldn't just have one had to
have all four you can definitely see
some dents in my naked one but I was
never someone who hit pan on I don't
think any of the
naked2 is my favorite naked palette I
still reach for this one verb is one of
my favorite eyeshadows of all time some
of the shadows and the naked palettes
are really beautiful and unique and
others I feel like are just so easily do
pible now but when these first came out
these were top-notch I did some damage
on sin now that I'm looking at it also
have the naked smoky palette here I've
definitely as this one the least amount
I remember when I would just sit there
and watch Naked palette tutorials for
two hours I feel like this wouldn't be a
YouTube made me buy a video if I didn't
mention Becca highlighters and champagne
pop champagne pop was obviously created
by Jacqueline Hill YouTube 100% made me
buy this champagne pop is too dark for
my skin so I usually reach for moonstone
if I'm gonna wear back a highlight but I
feel like I'm one of the few people who
isn't as obsessed with these they kind
of just slide off my face you look
really pretty when I first put it on and
then like a half hour later it looks
like I'm not wearing any highlight that
haven't anyone else or just get a dud
Too Faced better than sex mascara I
don't remember who I bought this because
of I'm pretty sure it was just really
popular one point Tarte lights camera
lashes mascara it's also a total cult
favorite on YouTube I am team better
than sex 100% I use this mascara every
single day if you ever want to know
what's on my eyelashes when I'm not
wearing falsies it's Too Faced better
than sex
it doesn't claim that it's waterproof
but it totally is I like this way better
than their waterproof version that they
came out with this is great you can
usually get samples or like deluxe size
with certain also purchases mascara is
one of those things that I'm always
super hesitant to recommend because
people just have such different
preferences when it comes to mascara
Laura Mercier translucent loose setting
powder another one those loose setting
powder is that I don't think my skin
likes my favorite loose setting powder
that does work with my skin is the cover
effects lumen ating loose setting powder
that one is beautiful it doesn't give me
the weird texture it doesn't take away
coverage from my face so I never really
reach for this and then the last guy is
the Kat Von D everlasting liquid
lipstick in Lolita I think this might
have been kind of one of the first
mainstream liquid
lipsticks and by that I mean brands that
are carried in Sephora but there were
more indie brands that first came out
with liquid lipsticks on Instagram this
specific color Lolita definitely blew up
on YouTube I actually got the
reformulated version so they first came
out with a Lolita and it's a little bit
lighter and then they kind of reform
related to this like brick brownie red
shade which is still super pretty but
it's definitely a completely different
shade than the original Lita so that was
everything
I literally have 50 more products I
could have mentioned by just narrowed it
down to those so we're not sitting here
