and rejects
I am half fully drowsy drugged out on
migraine meds right now and half really
caffeinated so this should be a fun
video March fricking flew by literally
the fastest month so far I don't know
how the heck it's already spring but I'm
really down for spring right now it has
actually been getting sunny in Seattle
feeling really good about life right now
I don't have a whole lot of products to
mention this month because my last days
and rejects was like ginormous I also
just filmed my everyday foundation
routine that video basically talks about
my favorite skin and foundation products
at the moment so I'm not mentioning any
of those in this video just because I
just did a whole video talking about
that so you can go watch that if you're
interested let's get into it so the
first project is the brand new color pop
brow pencil color pop came out with brow
pencils and potted gel brow products
actually having tried the gel ones yet
because I can't get the freaking things
open literally I swear they like super
glued lids on these if you can figure
out how to get the lids off those darn
things let me know I've tried recruiting
roommates I've tried everything I can't
get him open but the brow pencil is
really nice it's what I'm wearing on my
brows right now I've pretty much just
been wearing this I dig in my brows
permanently cosmetic tattooing permanent
brows whatever about permanent brow is a
dutiful video on it so I've only needed
to fill in my brows a little bit lately
which has been super nice but it has
this fully end and then the actual
pencil is a really nice wind up fine
point
it's a retractable pencil nothing super
special except these are like five
dollars really nice quality with a lot
of brow pencils I find that either
glides on too soft where you're kind of
getting too much color or it's too waxy
and I feel like this is the perfect
medium I have been really enjoying this
the shade I have is black and brown I
also use the shade bang and Burnett just
depending on what I'm feeling like that
day I think this brow pencil is an
awesome affordable option next I have to
mention this because this has like
changed my hair this is the east long
sleek dream smoothing balm I feel like a
salon hair products are totally
underrated I've done a couple
videos with them and you guys know that
I'm like pretty selective about the
sponsorships I take on Eastland hair
products there's only been one that I've
been disappointed with so far and that's
the shampoo and that just didn't lather
and I mentioned it in my empties video
but like I can't find a high-end shampoo
that actually lathers and for me that's
just something really like in shampoos
but anyways every hair product I've
tried from them so far I've loved I love
their heat protectant this smoothing
balm is like the balm no pun intended
though says this smooths from the inside
out eliminates frizz and increases style
memory who knows if that's true but what
I do know I put this in my hair when
it's damp before I blow-dry it and my
hair has never felt so soft I have super
thick coarse wavy hair and I can pretty
much go would just blow drying my hair
now I still straighten it just because I
feel like it holds in my hair better but
I could go outside without looking like
Simba if I had to
thanks to this stuff I have this theory
that use long hair products are like
designed after perfume sense to me this
smells exactly like Marc Jacobs Daisy
you can get 3 for $15 which is super
affordable with the link down below it's
not an affiliate link I'm not making any
money off this but if you want to save
some money you can use that link so it's
$5 product which is an amazing deal next
is a new setting spray in my life and
this is the makeup forever mist and fix
this I've been using every single day it
is freaking expensive so I've literally
been using like a few spritzes of this
and then using my L'Oreal for the rest
of my face but I feel like this actually
really makes a difference if you have
like an event that you need to go to if
you need your makeup to last especially
long I think this stuff is worth the
money it gives you a super pretty dewy
finish to your face the only thing I
don't like about this is the spritzer I
feel like it's kind of like fire hose
status doesn't have as nice of a mist as
the L'Oreal one and thinking about
pouring this in my L'Oreal bottle just
because I love the way that that
wouldn't miss out this one is a little
bit harsh and I feel like I have to kind
of like do a weird spray thing when I do
it to get my face evenly next are these
lashes and these are lashes I'm wearing
right now
it's cara cara whatever x4 you can get
these off I Kate house and these are
dollar lashes I'm pretty sure all of the
Care brand are a dollar and I've tried a
few different versions of this brand and
they're just really nice for the price I
love the way these ones look I feel like
these would be really nice for prom if
you have prom coming up
I feel like this style s4 would be
really nice I'm not wearing any eyeliner
right now and it just opens up your eyes
leave the link for these down below
along with everything else that I
mentioning well no sage don't you hate
that when you're wearing a foundation
you can't like if your nose my lips have
been ridiculously dry this month I don't
know what it is they weren't bad at all
during winter and this month they're
literally peeling off my lips my lips
are peeling off my lips blistex
medicated lip Manhattan saving my lips I
put this on at night and like coat that
 on in the morning my lips aren't
peeling anymore they're good I do
reapply this throughout the day if I
have to I've tried like my high end lip
balms I've tried Carmack's fastly and
nothing works as well as this guy and
this is like a few dollars from the
drugstore lipstick that I've been
wearing pretty much every single day is
the Maybelline lipstick in 210 totally
toffee this is the shade right here
super nice neutral nude shade I wear
this to work it doesn't look too dark it
actually stays on pretty well for not
being like a long-lasting lipstick or
anything sometimes I'll use the lip
liner with this sometimes I'll just put
it on super quick in the morning just a
really nice everyday shade and if you
need something that's wearable for
school or work get this it's like five
dollars from the drugstore the other two
lip products that stood out this month
with the colour-pop ultra matte lips in
the shade kay and chai i believe both
these were from the color pop kpop
collection and these are just so freakin
pretty there's something about these
shades that just like are very appealing
to me I'm wearing K on my lips right now
it looks a lot darker on the lips and it
does in the tube so just be aware of
that I don't know why I was watching
this it's literally on my lips right now
so right there we have tri in there we
have K yeah okay
it's almost pretty similar in swatches
to the Maybelline one but I feel like
when
on your lips it looks a little bit
darker this I read about on snapchat if
you don't follow me on snapchat it's the
tale of snaps this is the Victoria
Secret love me more perfume no words so
as in the Victoria's Secret store and
smelled this and it was like love at
first sniff it smells like a girl
version of Acts but with more amber to
it and it's literally probably the most
addicting perfume smell I've ever
smelled I could sit here and sniff this
all day they were actually out of the
perfume in store and it is limited
edition
I thought the lady in store said it was
a fall perfume but online I think it
says spring 2016 so I think it's only
gonna be available first this spring
definitely picking up the body spray
online you need to go to the store and
smell this or if you have similar
perfume taste does me and then you can
just buy it online I do have a perfume
collection video I'm a major perfume
hoarder let's just whoa speaking of Acts
and do sense next I have the dial odor
armor 24-hour photo and neutralizing of
body wash and this stuff is legit
actually first tried this at a friend's
house in California they have this like
in their guest bathroom let's just be
real for a sec I sweat I have to take on
the deodorant and this stuff legit helps
actually neutralizes your underarm odor
if you can't find a good deodorant that
actually works on you try this in
combination with a deodorant sometimes
the guy products can be a little harsh
under your arms this I haven't had any
issues with smells like a really good
smelling dude the Senate does linger a
little bit so if you don't want to smell
like the guy just spray some perfume
over top but for me it's worth it
because I like a good smelling guys or
the worst thing in the world
alright my last rave of the month is
this covergirl trublend blush and the
shade medium rose I just had to say that
25 times this is one their new blushes
the shade of this is just beautiful I
use this in my Mad Men tutorial and that
was like a little bit more heavy-handed
than I usually apply it but I wear this
almost
single-day really nice pink rosy flush
stays on all day has a really nice
finish to it and I'm just really feeling
this all right on to rejects I have
three rejects this month the first one
is from Physicians Formula you guys know
is one of my favorite drugstore brands
two of my Holy Grail products are from
them but this one didn't cut it so this
is an ultra nourishing argan oil blush
in the shade natural this stuff has
straight-up glitter in it like I don't
know who wants to put glitter on their
face at first I thought it was just an
overlay there is gold ass glitter in
here it actually shows up on your face
as glitter sometimes blushes have a
little bit of glitter in them but when
you actually blend it on your face
somehow doesn't show up this is like you
have a catchy look going on the other
thing this smells like whoa straight up
grandma has such a strong scent you put
on your face and I started coughing ii
reject of the month
are these morphe cucumber wipes these
are supposed to be makeup removing wipes
these were pretty shitty i've been
keeping these in my makeup drawer to
just use on my desk area because these
do not do crap for my face you can get
your face makeup off but don't even go
there trying to remove eye makeup with
these things
my last reject is this grande liner lash
boosting liner i love the packaging on
this so i was pretty bummed of the
product pusha t this i used in a shadowy
schmooze video the yellow matte eye or
whatever and it just isn't that black at
all and the actual tip nothing comes out
of the tip of this I've tried storing it
upside down here someone who likes to
create a wing you need that tip to
actually have product and pigment to in
it and this just wasn't great so that
was everything I feel like you didn't
have a ton of stuff I'm getting whiffs
of this perfume and it smells so damn
good I'm filming this video on the
weekend like I always do and I am
cranking out the videos this weekend so
I hope you guys have been enjoying the
surplus of videos make sure you're
following me on all my social media I'm
on Instagram Twitter snapchat Facebook
if you guys like this video and you want
more ease and rejects videos give it a
up so I know love you guys thanks for
watching and see you my next video I
guess it makes you look like you're
wearing more makeup than you actually
are
wait no makes you look like you're
wearing
make sure eyes look really good without
having to actually try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
