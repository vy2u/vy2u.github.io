thinking about makeup right now 90%
thinking about a burrito alright so
today we have March rates and rejects
I'm all over the place today I just
filmed two other videos so apologies
that I look the same I'm basically gonna
be away from YouTube for like a week and
a half so I'm pre recording videos and
editing videos today I'm in the middle
of filming a leopard roll blog I'm in
the middle of moving right now it's like
it's kind of crazy or making raves and
rejects so I actually have a decent
amount of makeup products this month
that I am in love with and I'm super
excited to share with you guys literally
no idea how it's already April I feel
like it should still be like February
right now but it's been sunny in Seattle
not complaining all right what are we
gonna start out with so I'm gonna start
out with the eyeshadow palette that's on
my eyes right now I filmed a shadow in
shmooze video on the eye look I'm
wearing right now I'll link it over here
if the video is up so this is the
Gracias palette by the solo look David
from Soul look it's awesome he sent me
this palette just to try out and I
completely fell in love with it this
shade Natalia is literally the most
beautiful champagne color I'm wearing it
on my lids right now I'm also wearing it
on my cheeks as a highlight I've been
wearing this every single day as a
highlight on my face and if you have
fair skin this is seriously perfect like
I would get this palette just for the
highlight it's the only highlight that I
felt comfortable wearing to work because
it doesn't look like super crazy
highlight it just gives you such a
pretty glow the other shades are
gorgeous as well let's just watch them
for you guys so here are the shades
these are super pigmented super soft I
love the formula of these you get a
really decent size of each product to
packaging of this is really interesting
because it has a bunch of instagramers
names on it so I asked David what like
what was going on with story behind this
thing and they basically created the
gracias palette as a thank you to
instagramers who were supporting them as
a company and I thought that was just
really cool and unique and something
that I really appreciate it David was
awesome and gave you guys a coupon code
so if you want to check this out you can
use the code the Taylor 600 and it's for
15% off and I think it's lasting for a
month
if you want to get your hands on this
guy you should do it I have three
foundations that I want to mention the
first one is the Rimmel lasting finish
25 our comfort serum foundation I have a
whole video review on this product and I
basically raved about it and I think
this is an amazing foundation probably
one of my favorite foundations I've
tried in a while unfortunately I found
that this like severely broke me out I
can't really use it on my face anymore
I'm super bummed but if you don't have
acne prone skin you should be fine I
think there's something in Rimmel
products that like massively break me
out I can't use the Rimmel stay matte
powder even though I love that too I
can't use that because it literally
gives me like cystic acne worse than I
already have
it's seriously perfect though this gives
you a full coverage face but it still
looks like skin and it lasts for
freaking ever I'm pissed
so after I realized that that was
causing like mountainous regions on my
face I started using what is all over
this I started using this combination
this is the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
mixed in with the elf acne fighting
foundation in porcelain I realized that
over the last like years since I've been
using this and mixing it in with stuff
I've had not the lightest shade so I
picked up the lightest shade which is
porcelain and this is obviously the
lightest shade of pro matte I am NOT
like the hugest fan of the finish of
this on its own I don't like a super
matte face and that's what this gives me
so I like to mix it in with the elf acne
fighting foundation just to give it a
little more of like a natural looking
finish this one's pretty dewy and this
is pretty matte so mixed together these
seriously lasts all day I don't powder
my face with this I think that's because
of this guy you can go literally all day
and this will stay on so I've been
enjoying mixing these together you
remember one elf was only $1 have
another face product I want to mention
and that's the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade 15 fair I know
that this is not the lightest shade but
the shade 10 I think is 10 porcelain or
10 ivory or something is actually a lot
darker than 15 fair so if you've tried
out this concealer and it was way too
dark for you try the shade 15 this was
on those products that I just never
picked up because I have not been a fan
of the fit me foundation or powder or
anything this just did not appeal to me
at all I find
I picked this up I don't even know why I
think I was just at Fred Meyer and it
was like on sale holy you guys this
is freaking amazing I haven't even been
reaching for my NARS creamy concealer
and that's saying a lot because that is
like my Holy Grail concealer it is
unreal
this definitely isn't as full coverage
as the NARS concealer but the
consistency of this is just amazing it
blends out so well it's creamy but it's
not like it doesn't slide around and I
find that this creases a lot less than
the NARS concealer don't get me wrong I
still love my NARS but this stuff for
just kind of an everyday concealer is
what I've been reaching for it isn't
super light so if NARS Chantilly is like
perfect for you this is definitely way
darker than that I don't mind it and it
actually works for me because I use the
Physicians Formula translucent
correcting powder and that like just
lightens your concealer up perfectly
it works completely fine for me it stays
all day without creasing and it's just
beautiful then I have another product
that I picked up from the Fred Meyer
trip which I mentioned in the vlog this
is a Physicians Formula Paris daily
defense bronzer and this has SPF 30
which I didn't even realize this is
their new Sydney glow line why is that
flashing I instagrammed a photo of these
I think they have two or three different
ones I got the Paris bronzer because it
looked the lightest and the thing that
appealed to me about this is that
there's like a cool tone shade right
here and then there's a warmer one so if
you just want to contour you can use the
cool tone one if you want to just warm
up your face you can mix them both there
just use the top one I don't typically
contour I use bronzers or anything in
the morning before work just because
it's not something I feel like I need to
do but I've been reaching for this and I
just like the warmth that it gives my
face I feel like this is the first kind
of bronzer that I really like the look
of it on my skintone I'm wearing it
today it's probably toned down from the
lights there is a gold overlay that
comes on here I just like wiped it off
with my finger but it'll probably last
you a couple a couple uses if you like
the gold overlay otherwise this is
pretty matte I love the packaging of
this it's just matte black and sleek and
I like it so next I have a face oil this
is the pura d'Or argan oil acne
treatment solution I've been looking for
an
an oil that's like okay for acne I know
some people say that argan oil can help
your acne I just like really don't trust
putting additional oil on my face
especially when I have like cystic acne
it just feels wrong but when I saw this
is an acne treatment solution and I
looked at the ingredients it has argan
oil tea tree oil lavender oil cedar wood
oil a ton of other oils I've
actually really been enjoying this I've
been using this for about a month and a
half now and the texture of my skin just
feels amazing I think it's in
combination with the Walgreens studio 54
number the face cream that I mentioned
in my last reason rejects video I put a
couple of drops on my face and then I
wait a couple minutes let it absorb and
then I put on the night cream and my
skin just feels amazing in the morning
besides my acne my actual consistency
and like texture of my skin has
significantly improved and it feels
really nice like it feels really healthy
and plump I also like this because it's
an oil but it absorbs super quickly and
super nicely into your skin about every
other day I use this in the morning as
well
and it does not leave your skin oily you
can put foundation or primer or whatever
overtop and it just absorbs really
nicely into your skin it does smell
pretty like strong and naturally it
smells kind of like a mix of tea tree
oil and argan oil I like the smell tea
tree oil so it doesn't really bother me
but if you have acne are you trying to
get rid of your acne scars and you want
a good face oil I'll check this one out
and I have three lip products the first
are two essence products I also got from
the Fred Meyer trip this is the essence
lip liner in 0-6 satin mauve
so there's satin mauve this is the XXL
long left long-lasting lip gloss and a
shade stuck in the shade soft nude which
this is not a lip gloss at all this is
such a pretty lip cream I don't think
that these are super long-lasting I
mentioned these in the vlog video as
well and like swatch them and tried them
on and stuff the lip cream isn't super
long-lasting I've just been obsessed
with liquid lipsticks lately and this
smells like cake it smells exactly like
the Stila stay all day liquid lipstick
it smells so good if you like that like
me
kind of Kylie Jenner nude these two
together are perfect or just this one on
its own and essence is like insanely
affordable I think this was like a
dollar fifty and this is three bucks or
something you need to try them out then
we're throwing it back I went through my
makeup and I was getting rid of stuff
and reorganizing and whatever and I came
across the Revlon lip butters comment
down below
you remember these freakin lip butters
how kind of baby lips had their moments
I feel like these were all the rage like
when was that probably like four years
ago but I came across this one and this
is in the shade 95 creme brulee and I
remembered that this was one of doesn't
smell like anything I remember that this
was one of my favorite shades and it's
basically just kind of like a darky nude
I just keep this in my purse and throw
it on at work I usually don't like to
reapply lipstick at all throughout the
day so this is just easy because I don't
need a mirror I can just put it on and
it gives me some color so my last rave
of the month is a perfume and this is
the Burberry Brit perfume I think I
mentioned this I don't even know how
long ago that was probably like five or
six months ago in a rage the rejects
video I rediscovered it because my
friend that was staying with me a couple
weekends ago she was like borrowing my
perfume and sprayed it and it perfume
always smells so different on other
people I feel like you don't realize how
much you like it until you smell it on
someone else I never realized how good
it smelled it smells like so
sophisticated but fresh so I've been
using this every single day again I went
through a phase with this the phase is
back so I'm actually remembering my
rejects this month shocker and I have
three so the first one is the makeup
revolution liquid eyeliner there's not
any kind of name on here just as makeup
revolution I've liked pretty much
everything I've tried from makeup
revolution
except for this it's super black but the
issue is that first of all the wand is a
little strange it looks like it's gonna
be good because it's superfine but it
literally like curves even if you curve
it against the shape of your eye it's
just super difficult to apply it you
can't go over your stroke or it'll
completely wipe off what you already put
on just not a fan at all would not
recommend this going in the trash my
second reject of the month is bare
minerals well rested illuminator this
isn't a shade clear
I got this off Lamba I don't know if the
one that people like if there's like a
concealer version of this or something
but this isn't a shade clear and I just
assumed that that meant it was the
lightest shade but this is just kind of
like completely pointless to me it's
basically like a little bit of an
illuminator I can barely see it on my
hand so you guys probably won't be able
to see it as far as I understand it's
supposed to be kind of an illuminator
for the under eyes to make you look more
awake and kind of brighten everything up
I tried it by itself which did
absolutely nothing I also tried mixing
it in with concealers I tried putting it
like on top of my concealers it just
really didn't work for me and it just
feels kind of pointless let me know if
you guys have tried well rested and
which shade or whatever you like because
this just really didn't do it for me
the last reject is the Becca ultimate
coverage complexion cream I asked you
guys probably a couple months ago now if
you wanted to see a review on this and I
can't even like fully test it out for
you because the lightest shade is so
freakin orange it's not even dark but
it's like straight-up orange it's still
in the box because I am gonna be
returning this because I'm not happy
with it at all it's not just to reject
because of the shade for me first time I
applied it I applied it without mixing
it into anything just to see if the
shape could work it reminds me kind of
exactly of the Kat Von D locket tattoo
foundation I know some people love that
foundation so if you like that you might
like this foundation it just feels super
heavy to me and cakey Kat Von D I can
make work because I mix it in with
either moisturizer or another foundation
that's kind of do here this one is just
not exactly what I look for in a
foundation so anybody returning this one
jus Sephora and I'm not gonna have a
whole review on this because like I said
the shade didn't work for me and I just
feel like I don't have enough to say
about it
so that was March raised and rejects if
you guys like this video and you like
raves and rejects videos give it a
thumbs up so I know I feel like I just
said that exact sentence like a week ago
or February raison rejects crazy comment
down below with what your guys's
favorite products of March work I want
to know love you guys thanks for
watching and see you in my next video
bye
