just disappeared okay oh it's gone
all right so today we're going to be
doing Marjorie's and rejects I am so
beyond ready for spring who's with me
we had one sunny day in Seattle the
other day and all was good in the world
never thought I'd say it but I'm
actually ready for some fun so I
actually didn't film a February raisin
eject so these are kind of my favorite
products and least favorite products
from the last couple months if I have a
decent amount here so grab some coffee I
have mine Cheers and let's jump into it
if you're excited for Ray's and rejects
videos and you want these to continue
make sure his video thumbs up so I know
if you're new here you can join the BAE
Rito family and subscribe I upload
Monday Wednesday Fridays 6 p.m. fifth
time when you guys are saying this yeah
15 days of foundation is coming up so 15
days of foundation starts April 5th and
it's going to the 19th so make sure
you're subscribed so you don't miss out
what my LS just like literally went
above my eyebrow embrasure where do I
even begin let's start out with a lip
combo that I've been wearing pretty much
any time I want a light nude lip this
combo is literally what I've been raging
for 9 out of 10 times I do my lipstick
on just for everyday makeup when I'm not
filming this is the Sephora liquid
lipstick in the shade 32 mixed in with
the wet and wild liquid katsu in nudie
patooty I put this one on first you can
even go in with a liner if you need to
or want to because the remote badger a
liner in the shade 0:32 innocent this is
awesome with these two products I do
have on a tiny bit of the liner first
and then I go in with 32 then I go in
with the wet and wild one when it's
still wet just so it mixes together
easier some reason the formula of this
shade is different than some of the
other liquid cat suits that I've tried I
don't like the ones that don't dry down
and feel kind of sticky this one totally
dries down Matt few bucks from the
drugstore the formula Sephora ones are
awesome they fail in all day they're not
super drying then if I want a gloss
which I have on right now a little bit
this is the mu a lip gloss I've
mentioned this before in the shade baby
pink this is such a beautiful light pink
shade hate to smell this thing but one
of you guys actually recommended mixing
in a couple drops of peppermint oil and
that is what I do and now smells amazing
smells like peppermint and it gives it
kind of like a tingly finish to it that
just made me like this five thousand
times more smells so freakin good
peppermint is safe to mix in with like
lip balms and lip products just don't he
did don't ingest it I've been loving
this it is very hard to find
a really light nude liquid lipsticks
combo for my skin tone ever came out
with a nude liquid lipstick you're
looking at it so moving on to a
highlighter which has been the love of
my life since I discovered it and ever
I'm filming I try and switch it up so
it's not like the same products all the
time but it has been a struggle to not
reach for this every single day this is
the jcat you glow girl highlight in the
shade Bella Rose I'm wearing it right
now you probably saw this coming if you
follow me on snapchat because I've been
raving about this this is nine bucks you
can't get this exact shade on Ulta yet I
believe you can only get it on the jcat
website and possibly Amazon it is such a
beautiful intense but not glittery it
gives you that kind of wet effect
highlight has a pink tone to it you can
use as eye shadow I've been using it on
my lid and in my inner corner as well
but I have them in my inner corner today
it's just stunning you need this in your
life I have tried the other shades on
this line of highlighters and they're
not my cup of tea they're a bit too
glittery for my liking so I'm only
recommending this shade Bella Rose this
is just beautiful to like to look at I
mean it's a rose you can't go wrong by
the way my favorite brush to apply that
has been the Sigma fo3 I've been
reaching for this brush a lot more the
past couple months than my morphe m 5-10
brush I usually use both them are great
they just apply product differently so I
just switch it up depending on whatever
highlight I'm using we all knew this one
was coming this is the pur cosmetics
bear doll foundation I mean can I marry
you I'm just in love with this I have a
whole review on this product
pretty much what I reach for if I'm not
filming if I just want good coverage is
going to last all day
this one works amazing on my skin I can
go in just about the actual product
since they have a whole video on it but
I apply it with the elf foundation brush
technically a powder brush but it works
awesome for kind of thicker foundations
I do think that this is one of those
foundations that you have to find a
primer that works best with it in the
jouer anti blemish matte primer i feel
like has worked amazing with this
foundation been running out this i've
been trying it with different primers
and i do think that i might need to
repurchase this because of this
foundation a bunch of you guys have
snapped into ease is saying that you
pick this up and a lot of you absolutely
love it and it's your new holy grail and
are also people who didn't like it and
it didn't work out for them so just like
i say with any product then depend on
your skin type and every product works
differently for different people so just
keep that in mind when you're purchasing
anything that anyone recommends how
everything is going to work across the
board for everyone but this foundation
has been my go-to and it is rare that I
find one where the shade works the
coverage is good I don't need to mix
anything in with it and it lasts all day
and I like the finish of it everything
and that is this foundation for me it's
a bunch of guys were purchasing this pur
cosmetics gave me a 20% off discount
code for you guys at the Argan purchases
which is the code Taylor and Kat blocks
and you get 20% off your entire order on
pure cosmetics well we're talking about
pur cosmetics might as well move on to
these lashes because these have been
what I've been reaching for almost any
time I want to put on lashes I'm wearing
bombshell right now they're their new
pro 3 silk cruelty free lashes the thing
I love about these is that even though
they have a little bit more of a thick
band they're not uncomfortable at all
they feel very lightweight on the eyes
you don't feel like you're blinking
5,000 pounds and they've lasted amazing
I've probably worn this pair at least 10
times I also really love jetsedder these
ones are more wispy and separated these
ones that I'm wearing right now
bombshell would be great for prom or
wedding makeup if you want more of like
an intense lash I pretty much wear my
lashes until they're completely
destroyed and look like a dead spider or
they end up in my shag carpet these are
just great quality pur cosmetics was
kind of killing it this month I do have
actually one of my rejects from BH
Cosmetics those two products foundation
and eyelashes tell yeah so this next
product is been totally easily
accessible with your base in the u.s. I
picked this up in London it's the Max
Factor nude mob blush I feel like I've
mentioned this 5000 times in videos
since I got this but it's what I'm
wearing right now it is beautiful just
gives you a natural kind of pink cheek
goes with literally any makeup look has
a nice finish to it where it's not
totally matte blends out easily this is
from the drugstore in the UK think you
can get Max Factor at certain cbs's they
don't have it at the one in Seattle but
if you can find this in US or orders
online do it it is beautiful this next
thing I've been randomly having a major
love affair with I don't know why
because this isn't a new product or
anything but this is the Urban Decay
Naked ultimate basics palette my mirror
fell out so I don't have a mirror I've
been obsessed with using cool tones
lately all the matte shadows on my eyes
today are from this palette all the
shades in here just blend out so easily
they're pigmented they don't have
fallout there
than about them that I just really enjoy
and I feel like because this palette has
some warm tones down here there's a
black there's some lighter shades it's
just really versatile so this next
product which actually kind of surprised
me was the pixie its GG time eyeshadow
palette the matte shades in here holy
crap they're amazing they are so soft so
pigmented the matches in here are
beautiful the shimmery ones are also
nice I don't think it's my favorite
shimmering eyeshadow formula but I think
matte shades they really killed it in
here they're obviously more warm tone
shadows but you can get this from Target
you've tried pixie eyeshadows in the
past and you were not impressed I would
seriously try out this palette because
these are beautiful if you're looking
for a great drugstore eyeliner that's
going to stay on your waterline and it
doesn't make my eyes irritated I have
very sensitive eyes a lot of eyeliners
that I put on my waterline will just
totally make my eyes water and burn and
this one doesn't
it is very black it stays on this is a
Catrice liquid metal gel eye pencil it's
called I'll be right black affordable
stays on I feel like there's not a whole
lot more I could say about this it's a
great drugstore eyeliner if you're in
the market for one and it's what I'm
wearing right now if you liked this
product deserves a mention because I
have been reaching for it a lot this is
the Physicians Formula bronze booster I
use this middle shade right here this
shade I've been using for eyeshadow
sometimes will even create an eyeshadow
look with these three shades but this
one I've been using as a contour and it
blends out easily it's not too warm it's
not too gray I do still like my ELF
eyebrow kit a tiny bit better but this
is a close second I want to say this is
the first drugstore product that is
designed for contouring that is actually
good for fair skin and that doesn't look
too orange actually a nice cool tone
shade so nice job Physicians Formula I
feel like they nailed it with that I
know everyone is freaking out about
these right now but there is a reason
these are.this feel alike nificent
metals liquid eyeshadow I only have one
of these right now I have like four
others in my car on Sephora but this is
in the shade diamond dust and I'm
actually debating getting the other ones
because they realize that this shade
totally morphs to whatever color you put
underneath it which is amazing so if you
have on pink eyeshadow underneath this
will look like more of a pink glitter if
you have on gold it'll look gold have
worn this with super cool toned gray
black smokey eye and it looks
silver so if you're going to get one
shade I would say go with this one
these are so great I am someone who
never reaches for glitter because it
just sounds like such a project to fall
out having to deal with the glue and
then cleaning it up afterwards and you
like glitter all over your face in here
you guys know how it goes
this basically solves all of your
problems it is just liquid glitter I've
used Urban Decay's glitter liner before
and just kind of put that all over the
lid but that one burns my eyes this does
not burn my eyes it is packed with
glitter like you're not just going to
get a little dusting of glitter you can
get an intense glitter lid with this if
you even go in with a liner brush and
use this kind of as like a glitter liner
the first few times I use this actually
didn't get any fallout so I don't know
what I was doing differently last couple
times I did I just got a couple specks
on my face but compared to what you
usually get with normal glitter I mean
it doesn't compare I have a few hair
products to mention this first one is
from Sally Beauty you can get this for
it's like under ten bucks this is a root
touch-up temporary hair color just comes
in different colors and you basically
just spray it on your roots if you have
growth coming in or I also like to use
this to cover up any foundation that I
got on my hairline a few other brands
make products like this like Oribe has
one it's just way more expensive than
this one and I have tried the Oribe one
and this one works just as well I have
the shade black this is by age beautiful
did I say that and I'm wearing it right
now if I wasn't wearing it right now I
would have a blonde stripe coming
through right now where my roots are the
only thing is that you really have to
guard your face especially for doing
this after you put on your foundation or
face makeup because black will get on
your face so I basically just put my
hand there and kind of spray around my
hairline it is tricky to get over here I
wish they made one like this which is a
smaller spray by the way I adopted a cap
this is not the Kappa came with it comes
with the black cap no idea where that is
cats are like socks like where the heck
do they go but this is just a wash out
product so it'll come out with soap and
water or shampoo I'm in Seattle we get
rain I haven't found that it bleeds at
all if you have dark hair you know the
struggle of getting foundation on it and
for me I tried to wipe it off I use baby
wipes so use makeup remover wipes and it
just doesn't fully come out of my hair
now I know it's just because my hair is
super coarse and just like absorbs
anything that touches it but this has
helped me a lot with that and it is
really nice when you're procrastinating
down your roots but you don't want to
look
get so quickly going to mention three
products for me salon that I've been
using over the last couple months I've
been using this product for I want to
say a year and a half now this is the
get heated thermal protectant hair mist
it smells so freakin good it smells like
perfume etholon has completely
underrated hair products they're pretty
much drugstore prices and their hair
products are amazing so I put this in my
hair when it's wet as a heat protectant
and then I use the sleek dreams
smoothing balm if you're going to be
blow-drying straightening styling in any
way your hair really helps to make my
hair smoother and kind of contain some
of the flyaways and I also been using
and loving the flexible hold hairspray I
hate to smell this one which sucks
because their products usually smell
amazing but this one it just has that
hairspray scent to me that I don't like
but what I'll do is I'll use this and
I'll spray some of my Elizabeth and
James dry shampoo over it and that just
completely eliminates the scent and
makes it smell amazing whenever I do the
whole shebang like wash dry curl my hair
after I shower I do it all at night and
then I use this hair spray and in the
morning it holds it the curl is still
there it looks like it has a nice
texture but it's not crunchy and gross
which is why I really like this for you
sure I have some kind of easel and
coupon for you guys so I'll put it down
below in the description box but really
affordable products and they're awesome
if you've never tried them so my last
wave of the month is the Dickinson's
witch hazel toner this is a hundred
percent natural fragrance free and
supposed to be more gentle as it
smoothes and balances the skin without
over-drying
this was recommended to me by you guys
for acne and I don't feel like it's made
a huge difference with my acne but I do
feel like it helps to kind of balance
out my face before I put on makeup so if
you're excessively oily definitely use
some kind of toner before you do your
makeup size this morning and night it's
really affordable you can get wet Jaisal
at the drugstore it doesn't have the
most pleasant scent I will say that I
actually hate the scent of this pool
kind of makes you want to gag but it
does the job and while we're talking
about skincare I still get a ton of
questions about my skin I love when
people assume that I don't do anything
from acne like I'm just chilling living
life with acne not trying to fix it you
must be new here
have tried pretty much everything from
acne and I am going on accutane waiting
until I get back from my China trip
which is at the end of May because I
need to be in the country to do the lab
test and every
every couple weeks I'll definitely be
documenting my accutane journey and
progress for you guys in videos but
basically I'm just in like maintenance
mode with my acne until I can go in
accutane so you're just going to have to
live with it like I do must be rough so
moving on to rejects I have a few I
don't have a whole lot this one is kind
of a follow-up to a foundation review
that I did this is the Clinique DIY
pigment drops and I didn't hate these in
that video I still don't hate them I
just think the cover effects signet
drops are much better try mixing moves
in with moisturizer I tried mixing them
with other foundations and they give my
face a very cakey have you looked to
them throughout the day which is why
their reject first I thought it was a
foundation I was mixing it with and it
just was that combo but after trying
these a few more times with different
foundations it's definitely this product
it just isn't the most flattering and I
definitely still think the cover effects
payment drops take the cake by far so
this thing didn't work at all for me
this is the tweezerman
this is their new dermaplaning-- or
whatever it's like the face shaver 600
on PR and I use facial razors for my
peach fuzz I can't do it on my chin area
because I have acne there any parts of
my face that I can I do use the little
tiny razors you can get them on Amazon
they're like a couple bucks this has
interchangeable blades so you're
supposed to be able to push this out and
like put a new one in I literally cannot
remove hair with this I don't know what
it is don't know if it's like my face
shape that doesn't work with this tool
I've tried going down I've tried going
up I've tried going sideways you name it
I've tried it it literally just doesn't
work for me hair is still in my face so
I definitely prefer my Amazon razors
that are like a few bucks also link
those down below either to of Peers new
palettes these are the vanity eyes and
cheeks palettes basically there's a few
eyeshadows in here and then a few cheek
products in each one the blushes and
bronzers in here are not bad at all
they're totally fine I actually really
like the shade and tone of this middle
one right here but the eyeshadows in
here they're bad they're chalky they're
stiff they don't blend out they don't
have great pigmentation to them which is
weird because the pure cosmetics
eyeshadows and their other palettes are
great but the ones in here just totally
fell short for me for the price of these
palettes I just don't think they're
worth it these were also sent in PR and
have the entire line of these and let me
tell
my thoughts these are the milk makeup
eye pigments I don't know if I'm doing
something wrong here
they swatch beautifully when you swatch
them on your hand they look amazing they
look super pigmented you can't wash them
off like they're super long-lasting but
when I actually put these on my eyes
I've tried to wear these about four
times now different shades of them they
just don't work when I apply these to my
eyes the pigmentation is not there it's
like it disappears they don't look as
intense as they do when it's watched
she's almost just keep moving around and
then all of a sudden they'll dry really
quickly you swatch so differently than
they actually look on your eyes I don't
know if I just got duds or if I'm
applying them wrong but if you have
these and you like I'm totally losing my
voice too sweet so what happens when you
film two videos every day what is
happening my voice literally just
disappeared okay oh it's gone well we're
finishing this house I don't know if
it's the way I'm applying these or what
but if you have them and you like them
let me know what has been working best
for you because these just really have
them too organ for me I was really
hoping that this was going to be my
miracle product help mattifying my skin
throughout the day this is the Becca
ever matte poreless priming Perfector
this is a travel size I'm glad I got the
tiny version first instead of just
getting the big one a bunch of you guys
recommended this on my shine controlling
primer video I did like a half face test
I have heard that you really have to
work with this and kind of like warm it
up between your fingers and not put on
too much or else your foundation can
just really cling to it and that is what
I found with every way I've tried to
apply it I really can't get this one to
work for me it just causes major texture
around that area it's like you can see a
line between where the primer is and
isn't when there's foundation over it
has a very intense thick sticky kind of
feel to it which I actually wouldn't
mind if it didn't cause the foundation
to kick up so again if you have this one
and it works well for you let me know
exactly how you apply it because I feel
like I've really tried to work with this
one and I just can't get it to work for
me unfortunately I'm still looking for a
primer that really helps to control oil
if you have any other recommendations
let me know down below
so my last reject of the month you guys
could probably guess if you saw this
video this is the it cosmetics
confidence and compact foundation
go watch the video if you haven't
already I'm not going to go in depth
about it but this one just really didn't
work for me I tried to use it again
coverage is not there at all for me I
don't think
full-coverage I love it cosmetics other
face products their CC cream is one of
my favorite products but this one with
the claims and everything just kind of
fell short to me so like I said fell
short like 20 times in this video so
those were all of my raves and rejects
let me know down below what your
favorite products were for the month or
a few products that also didn't work out
for you let us know down below I hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you did
make sure you give it a thumbs up I'm
gonna leave my rays and rejects playlist
down below so if you want to go watch
other months and see what my favorite
products have been it is down below love
