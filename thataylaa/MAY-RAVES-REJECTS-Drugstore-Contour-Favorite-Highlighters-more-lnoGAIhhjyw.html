rejects I haven't done a rigs and
rejects video in a couple months I think
they really have that many standout
products but since then I have some
super exciting things to share with you
guys and I'm excited
not sure which order all these videos
are going in because I've been pre
recording this whole weekend but I did
just film a whole get ready with me shot
a music video on this look using the
Becca cosmetics Jaclyn hill collection
so I'm pretty sure that will be up
before this may be so let's just get
into it so two of the standout products
this month
first L'Oreal glam bronze and they show
you zero-one light this is definitely
the best bronzer contour shade for pale
skin I have found from the drugstore
I've been using this almost every single
day it's not warm tone which is really
great it's a nice cool toned bronzer you
do have to build it up a little bit
which is good because then you don't get
that like overpowering bronze and there
it is right there
it's just perfect it has this super
slight shimmer like it's not fully matte
but when it's on your face you can't
tell at all and I feel like you just get
a ton of product this is a huge pan wait
till the drugstores do 40% off L'Oreal
or buy one get one free because they
always put their brands on sale this is
just awesome you need to try this out I
feel like my mom right now is hair color
okay anyways another product from the
drugstore this is the wet and wild
illuminating palette in the shade
catwalk pink this is one of their newer
products and holy crap this is a
gorgeous highlight definitely one of my
favorite highlighters from the drugstore
so far like the drugstore keeps like up
in their game so basically I like to mix
these two lightest shades right here as
a cheek bone highlight organized watch
this you just get this super pretty pale
glow and it's just beautiful it doesn't
look okay it's not even coming off on my
hand how it looks on the face but you
get a really pretty glow doesn't look
talky or sparkly or anything so it's
really nicely on the face to show you
which I use as like a shadow
pretty bronze shade or if you have dark
you could use that as a highlight or
bronzer or something
so these face masks I found in Norway I
did a whole Norway makeup haul video so
link that below but these are little
face masks pod things from H&amp;amp;M the
packaging just drew me in like how could
you not buy 10,000 of these I got a
bunch of different kinds my favorite one
so far has been this one this is the
witch hazel and willow-herb they have
peel off ones and they also have just
wash off ones this was one of the wash
off ones but it dries super hard just
made my face look and feel amazing it
helps you like calm down some of my red
acne scars okay I just got a little ear
back you can actually get a couple uses
out of these little pod things these
they're awesome to travel with because
you can literally just pop one of these
in your bag I looked online and they
only have a couple different kinds
online they had like literally 20
different ones of these in the store
right next is a product that was sent to
me like months ago and it was just kind
of sitting in the cabinet and this is
the shish shish shish ate oh why can't I
say bang Shiseido multi solution gel I
don't know why but this packaging just
like really didn't appeal to me it feels
super cheap actually for being a super
high-end brand like this but the actual
product once I started using it is
awesome does roughness and visible pore
care plus salicylic acid acne treatment
and as soon as I read that as like him
goodness ago and I've been using this
morning and night as my face cream
basically it looks like I haven't
touched it but since this is a gel it
just settles back in there but look at
that color the color is just like super
appealing to me oh that totally just
almost build oh this is actually awesome
as a base for your foundation so if you
use a tiny bit it gets a little bit
tacky kind of like the Nivea po shave
bong and then just settles on your face
and it's really awesome as a primer I
haven't been using a primer at all which
I think also is why my skin might be
doing a little bit better it's hard to
find a primary that doesn't break me out
and if I can use a face gel multitasking
as a primer then i'ma do it
so between being gone for a few weeks
traveling and everything I pretty much
packed one item like for everything if
that makes sense
I went away and that's what I wore every
single day so this colour-pop lippie
stick in the shade choker has hands-down
been my favorite lip color I can wear
this to work I can wear it on a daily
basis it's a nude but it doesn't look
too dark or too light and there it is
right there it's a super nice neutral
shade it doesn't have a lot of orange
tones in it or pink tones it's five
bucks from colour-pop actually is
working on a range of different skin
tones since it is pretty neutral next is
a new blush brush in my life this is the
morphine 53 from their elite collection
and I like this because one it's a
little bit tapered but not too much and
also it's just a little bit smaller than
a brush blush brush I was previously
using so it's just easier to get on the
actual area that you want to apply it
versus like sometimes I notice my blush
getting below my contour this one fits
perfectly I still love that brush and I
use that one to just switch off but this
one just works really nicely for
blending out blush I do have a discount
code with morphine and I did a whole
video on my favorite brushes so if you
want to know all my favorite makeup
brushes I'll link that video in the
description box and I'm a favorite
highlighter that I discovered is the
Laura Geller notes or finish setting
powder and the shady Universal I don't
know why but these kind of color
correcting powders typically work pretty
well for fair skin because when you
blend all the shades together you
usually get a nice pale white shade but
that just perfect this is all in this
product I feel like really depends on
the blush that you the blush the brush
that you apply it with I can get a nice
like subtle glow with this or a super
intense highlight depending on how much
I apply and what brush I use you could
also use this kind of as a setting
powder if you want to make a matte
foundation super glowy if you use a
really light hand and like a bigger
powder brush right I just have a couple
more rays this month I've been super
into false lashes I just need to find a
freaking eyelash glue that doesn't kill
my eyeballs House of lashes lash glue
totally messed up my left eye like
swelled up that was a good time but the
eyelashes that I've been lovin are these
eyelashes seducer lashes I've posted a
few
on Instagram wearing these and I
actually found these off the potluck
which is Nordstrom / sale site for like
10 bucks I think these are usually a
little bit on the pricey side here's
what they look like close up and they
are mink lashes well insert the photo
right here wearing these lashes so you
can see what they look like on the eye
but I just feel like they're super nice
combo of wispy but dramatic still
alright last Beauty rave is this Garnier
Fructis conditioner I think this is the
color hair line and I'm pretty sure that
we haven't said in the u.s. the
packaging is just a little bit different
this bottle is like smaller I got this
in Norway this conditioner is freakin
amazing I haven't used Garnier Fructis
and probably like I don't even know six
years their normal scent and like
packaging just doesn't really appeal to
me I was in desperate need of
conditioner when I was away and I don't
know what the heck is in this but this
freaking repairs your hair so well when
I was in Iceland
I literally just dunked in the Blue
Lagoon which apparently you're not
supposed to do but like sulphur kills
your hair so my hair was looking real
cute and like straw for like the
following week so I got this to try and
help and literally after washing my hair
one time with this my hair felt super
soft totally back to normal
I've been using this every time I wash
my hair now and you're a little bit onto
the rejects have a few rejects this
month and the first one is this sponge
that I actually tried out in the video
on the look I'm wearing right now this
is the Rite Aid sponge uh supposed to be
like a dupe for the Real Techniques
sponge it looks exactly the same this
was pretty horrible
it just doesn't soften like it's one of
those sponges that even when you wet it
it's like a freaking Rock when you put
on your face also don't even know why
they attempted to make a date for the
Real Techniques sponge because it's
literally like a dollar less than the
Real Techniques one I also got the dupe
for the Beauty Blender
so I'm hoping that one's better and if
that actually works it makes sense to
have a dupe I feel like why would you
even have to it's like a dollar cheaper
no saying it literally gave me no
coverage at all it soaked up all the
foundation I couldn't even blend it out
because it was so hard so this yeah not
good so for what this is intended to
this is a reject for me this is the
geometric wet-and-wild highlighting
powder in desert explorations and it's
limited edition and supposed to be like
a cheekbone highlight and it just really
like doesn't do it for me you don't get
that much colour payoff it just kind of
disappears when you blend it on your
face which is why it's good as an
all-over setting powder if you want that
glow if you want like a super subtle
glow just apply this with a big fluffy
brush if you watch the video you'll see
how it applies but I'm wearing a matte
foundation today and I feel like they
look pretty glowy but for what it's
intended for don't like it okay less
reject is this Proust professional dry
shampoo this is supposed to be for brown
hair it's just like I feel like they
literally package spray paint and put it
in a bottle for your hair it literally
tied you like the spray paint sound and
you just have to be super careful
because you can get this on your clothes
really easily straight-up Brown does
come out of this and this smell Oh
smells exactly like the Tresemme dry
shampoo oh it's so bad alright so that
was everything if you guys liked this
video give it a thumbs up so I know let
me know down below if you want to see an
on beauty related raves and rejects or
just current favorites feel like I have
a ton of random stuff like home stuff
and travel stuff that are pretty cool
and I kind of wanna share with you guys
let me know down below if you want to
see that love you guys thanks for
watching and see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
