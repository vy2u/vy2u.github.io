not a drill alright so today it is day
three of 15 days of foundation this is
where I test out a new first impression
no I did not test that was first
impression this is where I test out a
new foundation every single day for 15
days all the info about 15 days the
foundation will be linked down below in
the announcement video if you want to go
check that out but today we are throwing
it back I'm so excited to test this out
this is the Maybelline Dream matte
mousse foundation
I mean who remembers this thing I was
hardcore thinking about this and as last
time I have used this and put this on my
face was over ten years ago this was on
the first foundations I ever used I want
to say it was in about eighth grade so
I'm super curious to try this out again
see what I think of it thought it'd be
fun to switch it up and do kind of an
older product that no one really talks
about anymore this is actually weird
timing because this morning I was on
Instagram first thing I saw was this
meme I will insert it right here so I
felt like this product was meant to be
today today was a day to review this oh
I have new hair between me filming day
two and day three I've actually been in
San Diego the past few days visiting my
family and I got my hair done I went to
Brie at autumn Houston it's in downtown
San Diego she was awesome I actually
watched it for the first time since
having it done in the blue completely
bled into the other colors and I have
like mostly blue ends but I'm kind of
feeling it but here's a picture that I
post on Instagram right after I got it
done so that's what it looked like at
the beginning see I knew I'd feel like I
had to get the hair out of the way but
onto the foundation so I have no
thoughts on this foundation I do not
remember what I think of it I just know
that it was one the first products I
wore the fact that this has been around
for over 10 years and they still carry
this in the drugstore I feel like that
says something people must still be
buying this product looking on ulties
website this product retails for $8.99
and you get 0.64 ounces of product so
you do not get a full ounce of product
in 12 shades I have the shade porcelain
ivory which is the lightest shade light
one is also what it says some insert
swatches of this foundation compared to
some of the other lightest foundations
that I own right now this watch time
right here is the Maybelline Dream matte
mousse foundation in the shade light one
porcelain ivory the lightest shade next
over its a Laura Geller cover lot
foundation in the shade porcelain which
I did in yesterday's video
Natasha Genoa foundation X which was day
one derma called 2:08 Tarte rainforest
of the sea in the shade porcelain
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless 110
and pur cosmetics bear doll in the shade
porcelain I think that is the first time
I've ever done swatches in one take can
we get a hell yeah it says it's a
revolutionary whipped formula that
provides air soft perfect matte coverage
with a weightless feel blend
effortlessly for soft natural-looking
even toned result and that's all it says
man descriptions back in whatever year
that was can we keep them brief like
that one that was great so kind of their
newer version I guess of this foundation
would be the Maybelline Dream velvet I
actually really don't like this product
a foundation to not work for me at all
let me know if you guys want a separate
view on this probably during a
foundation Friday or something so I'm
curious to see if I like this one a
little bit better those are all the
claims if you're excited for 15 days the
foundation make sure you give this video
a thumbs up so good right now feels
really good to be filming sometimes you
need to just step away take a break I
need to remember that you want to see
days 1 &amp;amp; 2 they are linked down below
along with the playlist literally
everything you ever want to know is
always in the description box so if you
want to know what I think of the
Maybelline Dream matte mousse foundation
and how it applies and wears throughout
the day you're in the right place just
keep watching
alright so I'm super excited to film
right now I feel like that was a
much-needed break
feeling re-energized and pumped 450 news
foundation so I've already washed
moisturized and primed my face use my
Laura Mercier foundation primer that
imma be using throughout this entire
series we have upgraded to a new Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works candle lid no idea where my
other candle lid went and one side of my
face mmm use the morphe 31 foundation
brush and on the other side my Real
Techniques miracle complexion sponge
smells like I remember this is wild okay
so I'm just going to dab on I don't
remember anything about this product
don't remember how much coverage has
whoo feels extremely lightweight
actually just got pretty good coverage
under this lighting the shade actually
looks like it matches me pretty well now
it looks a little bit dark but I like
that it has a beige tone at least is not
orangie or too pink or anything I'm add
a little bit more to my forehead since
that doesn't cover a whole lot I think
back in the day I used to apply this
with my fingers looking like medium
coverage right now I mean you can still
see redness and stuff coming through but
it evened out my skin tone really well
and it's sitting on my skin really nice
it looks a little bit dry on my forehead
in certain areas but on my cheek area
and around my nose it just looks very
natural and smooth and kind of
lightweight it feels extremely
lightweight like doesn't feel like I
have anything on I can't remember if
this transfers I feel like it does I
have vivid memories of like hugging boys
in seventh grade and having my
foundation transfer onto the t-shirts
pretty sure that still happens okay I'm
going to try and build this up but let's
go in on this side first and see what
kind of coverage we can get with a
sponge I usually get better coverage
with a sponge when I kind of put out the
product on a pallet first and then dip
my sponge into it so that's what I'm
going to do it looks so bizarre on the
palette what does this look like it
looks like some kind of food
I actually remember using those triangle
sponges the white things cool that just
crumbled off what is happening over here
folks whoa I got a zoom even for this
hopefully you guys can see this there it
is legit crumbling on my face would not
recommend with a sponge this side looks
much smoother much more even you smooth
it out with your finger but I don't
think the sponge is going to work with
this one just kind of sticking onto the
sponge I use my finger for the forehead
and see what happens I think I actually
got a little bit better coverage on the
forehead with my fingers really curious
to see if this is going to build it all
it feels like you're putting on a primer
coverage off or one layer I would say
looks like solid medium I mean freckles
and stuff are still coming through but
it actually looks and feels very natural
right now while still kind of covering
up my redness and evening out some of my
acne and everything I can't tell if I
like it better with my fingers of the
brush I'm gonna try my fingers down here
see if it builds it's definitely
building I feel like I am using a lot of
products though you're really going to
blend this or else you're going to get
some patches build them a lot better
than I thought it was going to it
actually hasn't really dried down I was
going to kind of dry to a powder but it
still feels kind of moosie it's not
building to full coverage is building to
a high medium but definitely got better
coverage let's try this onto the brush
again try the brush on this side just to
see if it builds with a brush brush
applies it a lot quicker it's kind of
easier to blend out even though I'm
rubbing it's not really rubbing away any
of the coverage it is hard to blend out
some of the edges with your finger so
I'm going to go back in with a brush
shouldn't say this is super quick
application you really have to blend and
make sure all the edges are kind of
smooth in because I'm still finding
certain parts that are looking a little
bit patchy but overall it's looking
really smooth on my skin right now
definitely a matte finish I like the
tone of it has kind of a beige tone
hoping it doesn't oxidize it just
oxidizes it will be too dark but I think
right now it's wearable I think it looks
pretty nice very smooth right now I'm
not getting a whole lot of texture on my
forehead center of my forehead looks
pretty good so we're getting a late
start today has some work I had to do
this morning so it's 11:40 I'm not going
to powder my face with this one because
it's matte and I just feel like that
might be too much so we're going to call
the check-in time 11:40 I'm going to do
the rest of my makeup and I will be
right back okay so it's now twelve
eleven so let's take a look at the
foundation then I'm going to tell you
everything that's on the rest of my face
the only thing I noticed when I was
applying this was that when I put on my
concealer use of Tarte shaped tape where
are you
put it away I just a chart shape tape
every day and when I put that on it got
a little bit weird texture on top of the
foundation like when I pulled it down
into this area a little bit but I just
went over it with a sponge and it
smoothed out fine after that and once
I've said it with a powder under my eyes
it looks totally fine now my powder
products blended out totally fine on top
of it it has already oxidized when I was
in the bathroom here and just in this
mirror in my room not under the lights
it looks like it's almost gotten a bit
more pink as it's been on for about a
half hour now and then the other thing I
see is that on some of my dry patches on
my forehead it doesn't look super great
it doesn't look bad but if your skin is
on the dry side
as one probably isn't for you off the
bat on the rest of my face I used what I
use I use pretty much all color pops
because they came out with a ton of new
products from their own you know this is
called their peach collection but
everything's peach start with contour so
I tried a different contour product I
actually tried to use Maybelline brow
drama 250 blonde this is an eyebrow
palette I just use this middle shade
right here to contour and it works fine
then I went in with this color pop
palette I don't know what's going on
with all their palettes but they don't
have names on them unless I'm just
totally facing out and not seeing them
so I went in with this blush shade right
here which was extremely pigmented you
literally just need to like dab your
brush in this it's tiny bit hard to work
with when it's that pigmented but I
really liked this this is the super
shock cheek and forget-me-nots it's like
this super pretty pink all I'm wearing
as a highlight on my lid for this
shimmery orange shade I use flipper
which is gorgeous
then I use some of their matte shades I
have a whole video on the color pop
pressure on toes I think this is one
from the floor pan kit things also used
another no-name err
fine fine which palette those came from
we'll put it down below as all the
shadows I use for my eye lashes I use my
pur cosmetics jetsedder
I'm in love with their false lashes
these are amazing Zen lips a mixed color
pop naughty which is one of my favorites
with color pop jacquard this one was
like super intense orangie so I mixed it
with color pop knotty to tone it down a
tiny bit so I wear this throughout the
day the next check and I do will be in
natural lighting so you guys can see how
it looks
I'll see you guys in a few hours so it's
now 5:30 p.m. so foundations gone for
almost 6 hours so I am still very matte
which is nice eyebrows down it looks the
best it looks really nice and smooth and
matte not really creasing anywhere
around my nose it looks pretty good I'm
getting a tiny bit looks like it's a
little bit heavy around my nose on this
side I don't think my forehead looks
super good I think that's mostly because
I have acne up here I think if I didn't
have a lot to cover up right now in my
forehead it would be looking better
because it does still look if you just
look at the foundation asking aside it
looks pretty good not really separating
or anything on the center of my forehead
yet the skin was good this is a new
camera you can see some dryness and
stuff happening down here
when you get this close wow I can't even
see that in the mirror this camera is
like picking up more than in real life
keep in mind this is very HD very zoomed
in so in real life you're not going to
see this kind of stuff but it is not
looking too great around my nose area
here is it very zoomed in on the center
of my face on my forehead this was kind
of average to me right now so I'm just
going to keep wearing this throughout
tonight I'm just going to be editing
until Dancing with the Stars is on
I'm literally only watching it because
Nick is on from The Bachelor so I will
check back in with you guys at the end
of the night okay so smell 11:07 so it's
foundations actually been on for 12
hours
I just got sidetracked and here we are
12 hours later I just had a friend over
and I just asked her what she thinks of
the foundation and she thought it looked
really good and I was just now so 12
hours aware for 12 hours I'm pretty
impressed there are definitely some
areas like Brown my nose where it's not
looking super great but again maybe
that's a concealer because on my
forehead it hasn't separated a whole lot
hasn't gotten super oily I usually get
pretty oily by the end of the night and
this is not bad for me at all to get up
close are definitely some things going
on some zoom you guys and aside love's
really intense
horrible horrible around my nose oil
wise I think my forehead is pretty good
separating a tiny bit right there but
for 12 hours I've definitely had
foundations that look worse at this
point I think if you want something
that's matte and that has light to
medium coverage I think you would
definitely give more light coverage if
you choose if you just use less of this
product I don't like how I feel like I
really had to work with this to blend it
in so it does feel extremely lightweight
it just kind of feels like my skin when
I touch my face it's transferring a
little bit forehead probably will yeah
forehead strands through more visible
air out there I think I would wear this
again once my skin is better from not
breaking out but I don't have a whole
lot to cover up because it doesn't fit
very well on top of acne so I hope you
guys like this video if you did make
sure you give this a thumbs up love you
guys thanks for watching see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
