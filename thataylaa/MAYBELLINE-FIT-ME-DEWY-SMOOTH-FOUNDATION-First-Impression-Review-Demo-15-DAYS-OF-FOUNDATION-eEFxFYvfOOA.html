that possible
were you at
all right so today it's day 12 15 days
of foundation this is where I try out a
new foundation every single day for 15
days
today we're throwing it back to a very
old foundation this is the classic
Maybelline fit me dewy and smooth
foundation so matte and poreless I would
say is their more popular formula this
one I actually have never liked this
foundation I have a whole other video on
it it looks so bad on my skin oily skin
especially dry skin it's like a disaster
I always include 110 and swatches
because this is a fair shade from the
drugstore and it has very yellow
undertones so it just gives you kind of
a shade comparison but I don't actually
like this foundation at all but now that
my skin is dry a lot of you guys
actually recommended I don't know if it
was on snapchat something I mentioned a
bunch of you guys recommended that I try
this formula again the dewy and smooth
this is a totally different formula than
the matte and poreless I remember years
ago trying the dewy and smooth
foundation I don't think it was on
camera I think it was like maybe even
before I started making YouTube videos
so we will see how this is now on my dry
skin this foundation retails for about
$7.99 depending on where you get it it
has one fluid ounce product which is
standard so looking on Maybelline's
website it just says it's a smoothing
concentrate that hydrates rough patches
leaving skin with a naturally luminous
finish ideal for normal to dry skin and
it has SPF 18 in it it comes in 16
shades according to Maybelline's website
the lightest shade is 110 porcelain the
darker shade is 360 mocha I actually
have the shades 115 ivory and 120
classic I read I ordered these online
Ulta I believe and 110 is in a good
shade match for me so I figured out try
115 you guys will see how the shade
works and what I think of it but I'm
gonna do swatches of all three of these
shades we've got a ton of
Maybelline swatches here so first off is
the Maybelline dewy and smooth in the
shade 115 next over is the Maybelline
fit me matte and poreless in the exact
same shade 115 this one I would say is a
little bit more pink I don't know if
it's showing up on the swatches but it's
a little bit more peachy pink orangie
this one is the Maybelline fit me matte
and poreless in 110 cotton poreless in
112 dewy and smooth in 120 this is the
Maybelline fit me stick foundation the
shade
1:10 which I haven't used in so long I
kind of wanted to try it on my skin now
derma called 2:08 my closest shade match
and CYO lifeproof in 101 so if you're
excited for day 12 don't forget to give
this video a thumbs up if you're new
here you can join the burrito family and
subscribe days 1 through 11 are linked
down below in the season 5 foundation
right now 50 days foundation playlist if
you want to see what I think at the
Maybelline fit me dewy and smooth
foundation how to apply somewhere
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching all right
day 12 it is 9 55 in the morning right
now I've already washed moisturize and
prepped my skin you know the drill by
now I'm thinking about okay you're gonna
chill there I'm gonna go with this shade
115 I haven't done swatches yet but 120
looks way dark and 115 even looks a bit
dark I'm not quite 110 see how it goes
woah that just poured out I hate the
packaging of this foundation you
literally just have to pour it out and
get a giant-ass amount like that top my
face with my Sigma f80 other half with
my la girl sponge monster I'll start
with the brush on the side today I
literally have no memory of using this
foundation like I don't know grandma
bought I think of it at all
besides I remember it broke up I'm like
Whaley skin super easily throughout the
day and it just did not work on an oily
skin it like slid around and wasn't good
that feels like it's blending out like
butter on my skin much different than
the matte and poreless already looks
really smooth getting some like streak
marks it does look very smooth and that
took about 0.2 seconds to blend out into
my skin cannot put my finger on what
this smells like doesn't smell floral it
smells like a baking ingredient almost a
shade I think looks pretty good it seems
to be like sitting a little bit on top
of my skin so I think this is one that
I'm gonna smooth over with a sponge for
sure let's just move it over now
apparently looks really good it's not
clinging anywhere so far so good let's
try a sponge on the other side if you
like this is already oxidizing and
almost turning more pink the shade when
I first put it on I feel like looked
pretty good hopefully it doesn't keep
darkening
to get around my nose piercing I always
just take a little morphe brush it looks
a little bit patchy on the sponge side
actually lighter coverage I'm getting
high light coverage on this side this
shade is turning away pink on me I think
I would be a mix of probably 110 and 115
in this one avoiding your hairline and
putting on foundation is a true skill
that I do not have forehead is looking
good rest of my face looks good too I'm
gonna try and build this up on this side
with a sponge to see if we can get a
little bit more coverage so far I'm
liking applying it with the brush first
to get the coverage and then smoothing
it out with a sponge so I don't get
streaks because this one can get a
little bit streaky all around now we're
at medium coverage I still see freckles
coming through I still see scarring
things but I don't mind that the only
thing right now I'm not liking is how
much is oxidizing it does feel like a
foundation that if you don't set this it
is gonna slide around
it feels very creamy almost it doesn't
feel like the light illusion where it's
dewy but it feels almost like a gel so
it kind of like sets a little bit this
one feels like it's gonna come right off
if I really touch my face right now and
it did so I'm for sure gonna set this
part of my face I am deciding if I want
to set my forehead too tough because
when I set my forehead it'll look fine
at the beginning but I just get so dry
throughout the day that it starts
looking super crappy so I almost don't
want to set my forehead oh no I'm gonna
do the rest of my makeup and decide as
that's happening right now it's 1006 I'm
gonna do the rest of my makeup I think
I'm gonna do like a green smokey eye
today I'm excited so I'll be right back
okay so it's
oh it's 11:11 the check-in time is 10:10
that's when I finish up with my face I
had a lot of fun doing my makeup today
but to set my face actually set my
entire face for once except right here
on the center with the Sephora micro
smooth powder I mentioned this in my top
powders for setting foundation
video that I recently did for a
foundation Friday and I really like the
way that this set my face it looks
really lightweight it still looks like
skin and you still have some of the do
come
through I didn't set right here because
that is usually a total disaster when I
do that and really glad I didn't because
there are certain parts on my forehead
where I'm hoping it doesn't look drier
throughout the day right now it's
looking a little bit dry I just lost a
bobby pin in my hair how's that possible
were you bad Oh found him whoa I don't
even know how long I've had this body
fit in my hair this morning this does
feel like a foundation to me that no
matter what your skin type is you're
gonna have to set this because it just
slides around if not kind of one of
those foundations that if you touch your
face even as I was powdering I felt like
it was kind of moving around a little
bit so this is for sure one that you
need to set I think it feels really
lightweight I like how my skin is
looking it's not creasing anywhere it
looks good around my mouth area I'm
gonna show you guys what this looks like
in natural lighting and then we're gonna
do flash tests so here's how it looks
like a natural lighting looking at my
mirror it looks good not creasing
anywhere I think it looks nice I'll go
do a flash test even though there is SPF
18 in this it doesn't look bad like if
you're just looking at my forehead not
Mandurah area cuz obviously the powder
under eye causes flashback but just
looking at my forehead in the rest of my
face it looks lighter than my neck so
there is definitely a little bit of
flashback but it doesn't look bad to the
point where I wouldn't wear this one so
on the rest of my face I use the same
bronzer face powder that I used and I
think that was yesterday's video I use
this the bare minerals this is actually
a powder foundation in the shade 0-5 and
then for blush oh man I whipped out this
guy which back in the day and clearly
God does use out of this is the elf
peachy keen blush this is definitely
expired I definitely need to purchase
any one of these and like at that point
where it's so tempting to finish it that
I just I'm going to and I was probably
bad don't follow my lead I forgot how
much I love this blush shade it is so
pretty if you want a peachy blush and
then I used one of my favorite
highlighting palettes the hourglass
absolute strobe light palette I went in
with this middle kind of white gold
shade so pretty I also use that on my
inner corner my eye shadow I actually
tried out for the first time the lorac
lorac pro 2 palette and I don't know why
I've never picked up the Laura
palates I've been on this eyeshadow
thing where I'm trying to discover new
eyeshadow palettes that I like lorac
back in the day was one of my favorite
eyeshadow formulas so I picked up this
one and I want to pick up more of the
lorac Pro palette but just the tones in
this one I feel like I didn't have a
whole lot of these kind of more cool
tone shades I really liked this the only
thing I noticed with this one is that I
do have quite a bit of fallout but
whenever I get following I just use my
Sigma F 15 brush it's just like a duo
fiber brush and I'll brush it away like
that and it literally removes all that
fallout brush is also awesome for
bronzer so so far really liking this
palette and then on top of that the
really metallic kind of glittery thing
you're seeing is the jcat holographic 3d
eye topper this is in the shade wink
pink link tank that's meant to say this
just like transformed that lid shade
into such a cool mermaidy
green shade really feeling this on top
of that color for lips i use the
smashbox always on liquid lipstick in
the shade light an can we stop slaying
slay I'm like so over the slay board
anyone else
I'm over it this was not a flattering
Brown on my skin tone so then I put the
20 naked blush in the flower Beauty
lipstick overtop the formula tees are so
nice and creamy my eye lashes I used
pure divas again these are like the
lashes I go to if I want the shadow to
show through the lashes so that's
everything checking time is 10/10 I'm
gonna see you guys in a few hours and
natural lighting it's now 313 so it's
been on for 5 hours my eye makeup right
now is literally on fire like my eyes
are burnin I think I'm gonna need to rub
this off and attempt not to get the
foundation at all like just take off my
eye makeup I don't even know what's
happening it's like falling down here
can't help that it's fall out or is
because my eyes are watering so much but
I just want to like wash off my entire
face right now let's take a look at the
face my nose has some like rubs I don't
know what's happening there I don't know
if that's like eyeshadow falling on it
or it's just rubbed off there for some
reason I haven't touched my face there
at all but the rest of my face looks
pretty good not really noticing anything
at this point it was just good round my
creasing where I've been getting
creasing right here doesn't look too bad
I mean it's creasing a little bit but
not bad upper lip looks good around my
nose looks pretty good I did want to
show you guys that
sure just came in I was waiting for
these guys to come in so I could show
you guys but here's the heck yeah it's
15 days of foundation Illuma edition
design that was brought back this is the
slouchy version I've been getting
questions about what size I wear I wear
a size small and they are oversized and
baggy so these ones go up to size two XL
but they do run big and this was the
other design they don't talk to me at 16
days of foundation same things on the
slouchy supersoft shirt so you guys can
wear these for a future series too but
these are available right now
hundred-percent the proceeds goes to
project B share will try and raise
$20,000 the link is right at the top of
the description box there's a bunch of
other designs and you can also get these
two designs on mugs as well okay it's
734 so it's been on for about nine and a
half hours today it's been a little
rough not feeling the greatest and I
wiped off all the eyeshadow my eyes are
looking great over here today yeah I
have about no energy right now don't
really know what's going on with my body
lately so my foundation actually still
looks pretty good zoom in ignore the
whole eye situation I mean I don't even
know what's going on anymore I'm getting
a tiny tiny bit of separation right on
the center but the rest of my forehead
looks good I'm not getting any major
creasing anywhere else I didn't feel
like I look super moisturized or
anything but I also don't feel like my
skin is too dry right now I think of
setting spray over top would do really
well with this one just to add a little
bit more moisture and due to my skin but
I would totally wear this one again I am
pleasantly surprised by it for sure I
think this is one you're gonna have to
set no matter what your skin type and I
also for sure I think probably only
recommend this for dry skin because it
is so slight E and I just remember this
breaking up horribly on my skin before
if you have dry skin you might like this
one but maybe it would be a good mixing
one because I do like how it just kind
of glides on like butter and it is very
smoothing that's that I'm going to wash
my face I will see you guys tomorrow and
day 413 or today they 13 day 13 or day
12 no I think tomorrow's day 13 I love
you guys thanks for watching and see you
tomorrow
