all right so today it is day five of 15
days of foundation this is where I'm
testing out a new foundation every
single day for 15 days days one through
four are linked down below in a playlist
you can also watch last series which is
a few months ago if you didn't see that
you can go have the 15 days marathon at
the beginning of this I mentioned that
some of them are going to be like new
foundations and some are going to be
just the ones that I've been putting off
that have been most requested that I've
either try it out or that just you guys
want to know about so the foundation
we're going to be talking about today is
the Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
foundation this has been one of the most
requested foundations for the last
couple years literally I've already
tried this foundation a couple times
didn't have a great experience with it
did not like it this was just kind of
one of those foundations that I tried a
couple years ago did not like it and I
just never reach for it again I've only
tried the shade 110 which is the
lightest shade the lightest shade 110 is
way too yellow for me if you're super
pale and you're looking for a drugstore
foundation this is one of the lightest
ones I found from the drugstore but it
is super yellow toned they recently came
out with a ton of new shades they now
have 24 shades so I picked up one of the
new shades which is a shade up 112 I
also have 115 and 120 here I'm going to
be trying out this foundation like I've
never tried it before I'm going to try
my best to have an open mind come into
it without any preconceived notions
about the foundation just like it's a
normal first impression you guys have
probably seen this a lot in swatches in
my videos and the reason I include this
is because it's an easy foundation that
everyone can reference to a lot of
people own this foundation and if you're
pale 110 is kind of like standard pale
princess foundation so that is why I
include it in the swatches it doesn't
mean I like the foundation haven't worn
the foundation in years I'm inserting
some swatches right now of all four
shades also compared to a few other
foundations I own and then we will jump
into the claims
alright swatch time right here is the
Maybelline fit me matte poreless in 110
here's it in one-twelve one-fifteen and
120 I wish I'd watch these beforehand
because I think I actually would have
gone with 115 it looks way lighter than
112 not sure what's going on with that
shade this is the e to BB that we did in
day one of the days two or three I think
Jolie stick foundation in soft cream
covergirl clean matte BB in the lightest
shade which I love
these were a bitch to swatch because
there's no pump alright so looking at
some of the information online this
retails for about between 550 and 799
which is super affordable you get one
fluid ounce of product in here so
standard product size it comes in 24
shades and I believe they recently
extended the line like within the last
six months it looks like they have a
really good shade range now the deep
shades look pretty cheap and light
shades they have some options the
details on here are kind of lame it
doesn't actually say what it's supposed
to do says it goes beyond skin tone
matching to fit the unique texture
issues of normal to oily skin natural
seamless finish doesn't say what kind of
coverage is supposed to be it says for
normal to oily skin on here so if you
have dry skin I would stay away from
this one this is supposed to be like a
mattifying oil controlling foundation if
you guys are excited about 15 days
foundation don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up if you're not
following me on snapchat that's where a
lot of fun goes down at the end of the
day I always show some of the highlight
comments on snapchat we have like a
music jam sesh it's a good time so if
you want to see my thoughts on the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
foundation and how to apply somewhere
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching look at all
those clean brushes in the background
live at least in like two hours
yesterday washing brushes all right so
I've already washed moisturize in prime
my face with the GE anti blemish matte
primer I have four shades here that I'm
debating between actually I know the
lightest one I'm not going to do because
that's when I have used before
I haven't swatched any of these shades
yet I'm kind of thinking either 112 or
115 120 looks way too dark I ordered all
these online let's do 112 so these do
not have a pump so you're just gonna
have to pour them out on one side of my
face I'm gonna use a brush and then on
the other side I'm going to use my Real
Techniques sponge just to see if there's
a difference in application this is a
freshly washed brush look at this thing
I'm just going to step on my brush in
here
okay I got a lot got about medium
coverage down here and I did use quite a
bit of product almost eye and freckles
definitely sink covered up down here but
I would say overall looks nice and even
looks like medium coverage so let's try
it the sponge on this side well just got
the mountain sized amount of one layer
this doesn't have amazing coverage if
the coverage is kind of similar to the
hourglass foundation that we did
yesterday it's covering all the redness
and stuff and like evening out my skin
tone but you can still see freckles and
stuff coming through which can be good
if you're someone who likes more natural
coverage I typically like more full
coverage foundations but somedays I can
be into it alright so as far as
application brush versus sponge both of
them look really nice but I think I
actually like the sponge better it looks
like it has less texture on my face I
have a few dry spots and like texture on
this side that are definitely emphasized
a little bit I'm going to go in with a
second layer to get a little bit more
coverage just on like my problem areas
right here and to see if it's buildable
so I'm going to use a sponge for that
the none that I have two layers on
definitely got more coverage I do think
this is buildable I like the coverage
right right now I feel like it covered
all this really well with the second
layer you definitely see the texture of
it on my skin it doesn't look bad it
just you can tell i'm wearing foundation
right now it's also kind of creasing
around my nose area a little bit and i
didn't put a second layer around there
so just have the one layer around my
nose with this one i think maybe a
smoothing primer underneath could help
because this is just kind of like
sitting on top of my skin it looks like
i don't feel really be able to see the
texture right now but it doesn't look
bad just looks a little bit megabee it
definitely feels like it already set I'm
not going to set this with the powder
since it is supposed to be mattifying
and I think I can blend product easily
on top right now so we're going to call
the check-in time 9:45 I'm going to do
the rest of my makeup and I'll be right
back alright so it is now 10:15 the rest
of my makeup is on literally in about
five minutes my face oxidized like three
shades I don't know if you guys will
see this but here is my net color you
can literally see the line where it
blended the foundation down completely
completely oxidized so next time I'll
probably mix 110 with 112 this one is
just too yellow for me so I think if I
mix these two it might be good and just
go on the lighter side knowing that it's
going to oxidize in five minutes so
everything blended out fine on top but
it's not looking great it's already
creasing into a wrinkle right here that
I didn't know I had if you have more
mature skin off the bat I can already
tell no my upper lip is already starting
to crease and it's literally been on for
a half hour I don't have any powder on
my face I did use my ELF setting spray
just all over it just looks very
textured especially on my forehead you
can just see it in my lines and settling
on some dry patches if you are someone
who loves this foundation let me know
what primary use with it and if you said
it because every time I've tried to
apply it it just looks very foundation
II and crazy and heavy on the rest of my
face super quick contour I use Mac baby
don't go put on some pixie subtly
suntouch bronzer but I just kind of use
this as a blush highlight is goddess of
love by makeup revolution love this
thing I also have it on my inner corner
all the eyeshadows use today are from
two of the morphe little palettes these
are so frickin amazeballs awesome
blossom and copper popper are the two
shades I just used matte shades from
here and then on my lid shade right here
lashes are Kara s4 and lips are Oprah's
Nylund so when we're in my 15 days
foundation t-shirt today because I'm
about to go take pictures for social and
everything for this if you haven't
gotten your teacher yet the link will be
down below
after the proceeds from t-shirts are
going to Project Beauty share which is a
nonprofit that provides feminine beauty
products to women and transition and
women's shelters it is Sunday today when
I'm filming this so I am just cranking
out YouTube stuff next track and I do
will be in natural lighting so I'll
check back in in a few hours battery
just died on me but we're back with the
spare so was I saying shade wise I
definitely think I'll need to go with
110 or mix the two this is extreme
oxidizing so when my battery died I
somehow lost some footage so I'm sort of
voiceover this part so you can see
my thoughts at this point but basically
attend just warmed up to my skin it
actually looks better than when I first
applied it my forehead looks really
great
there's still some creasing around my
nose area but nothing horrible just
looks pretty much good right now I think
on my forehead is looking really good it
doesn't look highly but it just looks
like skin now doesn't look super matte
and heavy like it did when I first put
it on my eyes are super red because I've
been staring at a screen and brightest
lights for five hours filmed to other
videos editing photos for 15 days of
foundation t-shirts having a very
productive Sunday so I will keep this on
and check back in throughout the night
throughout the night at the end of the
night all right so it is now 724 so the
Foundation's been on for a little over
nine hours and let's take a look about
lipstick I look hello orange right now
it's not even showing up with this light
but seriously I look like an oompa
loompa right now I'm so Orange I think
it's oxidized even more throughout the
day you guys on snapchat today even
noticed not today when you're watching
this but when I'm filming this notice
that it looks super dark so dark I look
pretty oily I'm gonna try and turn this
down if you can see better it's not
horrible
just for being a mattifying foundation I
look pretty dang oily
I think the hourglass foundation
yesterday did much better job of
controlling my oil throughout the day so
if you have oily skin I would say you
might still need to set your face with
the powder with this one it doesn't look
horrible it just doesn't look great I
think there are other foundations that I
like much better the lines are on my
nose and lip actually look like they got
better throughout the day they're not as
huge which is odd overall I think it
just looks oily and it looks pretty
mediocre next time I try this I'm going
to use the lighter shade and then I'm
going to set it with a powder and see
how it where to start the day I feel
like this is one that need to play
around with different primers and
powders and stuff and I will update you
guys in the end of the series when I
give myself a little bit time after the
series to try out the foundations in
different ways and then in the best and
worst video I'll be ranking all them
telling you how they wore with different
powders and all that good stuff expect
an update there love you guys thanks for
watching
in tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
