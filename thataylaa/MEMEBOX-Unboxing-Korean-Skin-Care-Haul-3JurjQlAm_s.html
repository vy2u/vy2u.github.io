we have another boxing of the meaning
box if you want to watch my first
unboxing video I will link it over here
super happy with my first one and I
decided let's do a second one I've been
using a couple of the products from my
first box on a regular basis and so far
I really like couple them which will
probably be mentioned in my favorites
video so just to give you a 10-second
background on me me box they are a
Korean beauty box service what I really
like about them is that there's no
commitment involved you don't have to
like subscribe and then get a monthly
one sent to you you can just buy
whatever box you want at whatever time
which is what I really like about it if
you like three of the boxes they have
then you can buy all three if you just
want one you can buy one and either get
another one or not get another one is up
to you they sent out this box to me it
looks like I got the special number 6
whole grain box I'm guessing the whole
grain as in it's like all natural and
 yeah that's what it looks like the
whole green box is $23 and you get 8
full-size products which is really good
so they give you a little card
explaining everything here's all the
 so let's start with this this looks
interesting
this is a anti-stress heat therapy mask
by pure dem pure der it has a special
formula which is supposed to heat up
instantly after being applied to your
face like a hot towel treatment that's
interesting
never he is that before this is a
full-size product like you said all of
them are full size and this retails for
$12 on its own I will probably try it
out tonight and then tweet about it
you're not following my Twitter it's the
same as my YouTube
your name alright so then I got ooh
awesome and I cream I've actually been
on the lookout for a good eye cream so
this is exciting
blacktone my 680 eye cream let's read
about it details for $20 on its own so
already those two products which I
probably would buy my own a face mask
and eye cream that's already more than
what you pay for the box let's take this
guy out like I said I've been looking
for a good eye cream this is a huge-ass
eye cream bottle usually eye cream
during like a tiny jar so then buy the
same brand this little watery thing it
says that you're supposed to use this in
the first step of your skincare so I'm
assuming you apply this kind of like you
do with the toner it basically has the
same exact description as the eye cream
is just for all over your face but I'm
gonna look up whatever the lactam eye
sees are figure out if I want to put it
on my face or not this is a little
interesting herb clinic rice bran powder
pack this is getting borderline too
natural for me you mix this with oatmeal
and an adequate amount of milk apply
evenly over your face and rinse off
after 15 to 20 minutes it's kind of like
a do-it-yourself mask thing it seems
like seems like a lot of work scrub bar
it seems like they always put like a bar
kind of thing in the skincare boxes
hundred percent organic handmade
cleansing bar has a hobo oil I really
like hobo hobo oil so then there are a
 ton of masks and scrubs in here
there's a daily moisturizing hand mask
I've never used a hand mask before whoa
that's kind of cool it's a glove type
mask alright so the next one is a walnut
foot scrub also never used a foot scrub
which I probably should I don't know and
then there are two of the rice bran
collagen masks feel like there's
probably good info about this one so I'm
gonna read it Viking barakatuh paper
this has collagen and vitamin E and it's
supposed to be a brightening mask
alright so that was everything in my
Mimi box this time around I think I'm
gonna
go on right now and buy like one of the
makeup ones to show you guys I do have a
five dollar off coupon code from you box
if you want to try it and you want to
get five dollars off check the down bar
all the info is always down there if you
want to see the look I'm wearing right
now I have a shadow and schmooze video
coming up after this one so be sure your
subscribe so you don't miss out on that
I think that's everything
love you guys thanks for watching see
you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
