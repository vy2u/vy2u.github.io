like years this feels very beauty guru
I'm gonna start out with the it
cosmetics my sculpted face pellet and
use this in my crease as a transition
shade these blend out super easily I use
a lot of the shades in that palette for
my eyeshadow once that's all blended out
I'm gonna go in with a purple eyeshadow
stick as a base this is just gonna help
primer eyes and also lay down some color
I'm keeping this mostly on the lid and
just blending it out with my finger not
going too far up into the crease and the
shadows that we're gonna be using today
are from the brand new Sedona lace
pretty little Miss grace collab palette
by the way I do have a brow routine
video now which I'll link in the downbar
and I'll link the wig down below as well
so here's the palette there's some super
awesome really fun bright colors in here
I'm gonna go in with the shade charm
which is just the turquoise II blue
color and look at this frickin
pigmentation hell yeah
so just gonna put that on the lid on top
of that purple shade I'm keeping this
mostly in the center cuz I want there to
be purple on the inside and outside
corners you could also use green or pink
or whatever floats your boat the shades
in this palette actually are pretty
impressive if you want some bright
colors in your life I will leave a four
dollar off coupon code in the down bar
so you can pick it up next we're gonna
go in with the Urban Decay Naked 2
palette and I'm just gonna take the
shade T's you can use any kind of cool
tone taupey color that you have
be careful not to drag this shade too
far down because it can start looking a
little bit muddy with that purple and
then we're gonna go back into that same
purple eyeshadow pencil and just kind of
brighten everything up mostly focusing
on the outer V and then the inner corner
and then I'm just going to blend that
out with my pinky next we're gonna go in
with this silver kind of pressed pigment
from makeup revolution I'm not sure the
exact name of this but I'll have
everything listed down below at first I
absolutely hated this product and then I
found that that key is to just put it on
top of other shadows and it basically
turns any color into a foiled eyeshadow
which is pretty sweet here is the I
finish versus the other eye you can just
see how frickin insane that shimmer is I
actually really like this product now
and I kind of want to get more colors
I'm just lining the lower lash line
again with that purple shadow stick and
then we're gonna go over it with a brush
here's me attempting to blend that out
with a blending brush don't ask me why
did this and then I figured out that
life would be a lot easier if I actually
got the correct brush so now we're going
in and blending tease back over that
just to deepen it up a little bit
I just used a little bit darker of a
taupe shade also by makeup revolution I
think those are like a dollar or a pound
now I'm just going in with a white
eyeliner on my waterline
I literally just tried to say that pen
back and then we're gonna go in with Mac
35 lashes these are just super separated
and fluttery you can use any lashes that
you want obviously mine are a little
worn
I'm gonna take some mascara to just
blend my natural lashes with those false
lashes I like to do it after applying
the falsies I don't know that's just
what I like to do I'm going with wet and
wild to make a length mascara on the
bottom lash line my favorite and then
this white purpley kind of opalescent
eyeliner I love this product I actually
got this off of blam bought as one of
the like freebies look at that the
camera wasn't even fully picking up how
insane this product is
I'm just blending a pinky blush on my
cheeks and I'm gonna also go in with
this purpley blush by Mac and just add a
little bit of that I'm using the
highlight that's in that same a
cosmetics palette that we used at the
beginning and look at how forgetting
beautiful this is this gives your face
such a pretty glow I want to take a
purple lipstick this is a liner by color
pop in the shade brill's and I'm also
going to use their lippie stix pencil to
go over this afterwards they're liners
are awesome because their names the same
shade as their lippie stix except
they're actually a shade darker so you
really don't have to think about pairing
liners with lip products they just gonna
do it for you does that make any sense I
don't even know
so this is basically the final look if
you guys like this video and you want
more tutorials like this style give it a
thumbs up so you know love you guys
