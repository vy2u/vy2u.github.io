video this box of empty trash has
literally been sitting in my room for
three or four months now and moving
apartments right now so I figured not
about to haul a box of trash to my new
apartment just for an empties video
there's a lot of stuff we're going to
talk about and these videos aren't just
me like showing you my trash they're
kind of mini reviews on these products
which I really enjoy because there's
some things that just don't make it into
the favorites videos or just don't get
talked about but I still like it is 92
out right now in Seattle and it's about
102 in this room with the ring light so
literally this box is completely full
I'm excited to share some of these
products with you guys cuz they're ones
that I've been using for forever and
they just haven't finished yet so let's
do it
you should just bring the recycle bin in
here the first product I'm going to talk
about is the Neutrogena acne stress
control triple action toner it's
actually like a tiny bit left in here a
lot of you guys have been requesting
that I do a updated skincare routine I'm
definitely gonna be doing that because
my acne is pretty much gone now it's
just scarring which is awesome I have
kind of like a combo of things that I
think worked for me I don't think it was
solely one product but I do think this
is one of those products that really
helped my skin I remember use this like
sophomore year college when my skin was
the clear set had been I didn't really
connect the dots that I think it might
have actually been this product this is
basically a toner and I use it in the
morning and I I like the way it feels on
my skin it feels really fresh the good
way to balance your skin before you put
on foundation or before you go to bed at
night says it eliminates oil and shine
treats acne before it emerges and blah
blah I really love this stuff I will
continue to repurchase this stuff and if
you have acne trends so next we have the
bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks sensual amber body
lotion this literally took me about
three years to finish
I don't super regularly use body lotion
just when I like remember I don't have
dry skin or anything I just really love
the way that the smells I will be
repurchasing this scent because I
freaking love it the scent just brings
back like good teenage memories you know
what I mean
so I have a couple hair sprays one that
I love one that I'm not a huge fan of
the one that I am NOT a huge fan of is
the Herbal Essence set me up hair spray
it does make your hair a little bit
stiff I don't really like the smell and
I'm glad I finished this this bad boy on
the other hand is a semi Galena semi
Delino who knows illuminating hair spray
actually got this can from when I was in
Jordan this is a really popular hair
spray in the Middle East and I believe
in Europe too I got it from a salon
it smells freakin amazing makes your
hair it's super shiny and just is like
the perfect amount of cold where it's
not crunchy I can spray this on after I
straighten my hair and it just makes it
stay without crunch enough since being
back in u.s. I've tried to find this the
only place I found it was look fantastic
calmed I ordered it and it got lost in
the mail so that's awesome
let me know if you've found any other
places where you can find this like in
stores in the US all right I have three
deodorants because that's how long it's
been since these have been sitting here
lady speed stick to powder fresh one
shower fresh nothing too exciting here I
got these from the Dollar Tree we have a
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works flannel candle this is
one of those ones that smells like man
and it smells amazing I'm all about the
man send those they're kind of the only
candles that are burnt by the way if you
purchase the Bath &amp;amp; Body Works candle
save the lid that they give you it's a
little tin lid that's what I used to mix
my foundations on and it's perfect
because you can just wipe it off and
clean it really easily
that's and Body Works also always has
cash back on Ebates I'll leave a link
for e-base down below but basically I
use it every single time we shop online
this is not sponsored by Ebates or
anything but it's freaking amazing
I've saved like hundreds of dollars over
the last year shopping online that's a
new year shopping on it while we're on
the candles another man candle this is
Black Tie I believe this was a limited
edition holiday one from two years ago I
really like the packaging of this one
with the black and gold killing it at
the body works alright who remembers
this guy when I first started youtube
this was like the product of the year
everyone was talking about this so I
obviously picked it up and tried it out
to be clearly honest I never understood
the complete obsession with this I think
there are hair masks that do just as
good of a job if not better and for the
price I just would not repurchase this
again I don't think it's bad I just
don't think it's worth your money I have
the L'Oreal ever style energizing the
dry shampoo I can't remember if I liked
it I think I liked it I just wasn't
crazy about it it just
doesn't work as well as my swab dry
shampoo we have another face product -
Neutrogena rapid clear as far as like
face washes and drugstore face products
Neutrogena is like my go-to brand my
skin just loves Neutrogena and it works
really well for me this is the foaming
scrubs I already say this 2% salicylic
acid benzoyl peroxide it doesn't work as
well for my skin a salicylic acid so I
tend to go towards products that have
salicylic acid that's a fun word to say
I definitely repurchase this right now
I'm using a different one by Neutrogena
that you'll probably see in my skincare
routine I have three of the boreal
infallible makeup extender setting spray
actually go through these things pretty
fast I use like eight to ten sprays on
my face which is really excessive but I
just like the way that it feels
this setting spray is by far my favorite
setting spray we've ever tried drugstore
or not it makes my foundation look nice
and natural and dewy it actually makes
my foundation look more dewy than the
NYX dewy setting spray which is
interesting is a really nice fine mist
not too intense of the spray Tulsa
makeup stay on longer I would highly
suggest you buy this I'm just gonna skip
through a couple of my like Holy Grail
products really fast because you guys
have heard me talk about these five
billion times two of the Physicians
Formula translucent correcting powders I
use this to set my under eye concealer
which you know Physicians Formula I
booster this is my Holy Grail eyeliner I
think I've used like ten of these up if
not more two of my favorite mascaras
Maybelline falsies and Maybelline last
is that woah Maybelline lash sensational
there we go Taylor ivory phone in love
with Maybelline falsies number I wear
this in a video you guys always ask
which policies I'm wearing that's why I
know it's good I just love this the wand
on this the formula everything about
this same with this I really like this
one as well it just has more of a combed
where you go comb kind of applicator
just kidding I have four of the
Physicians Formula powders I have a few
different makeup removing kind of
products the first is the Kirkland brand
daily facial towelettes I actually
really liked these these worked really
well as kind of surprised they didn't
burn my eyes they took off everything
they're cheaper than the Neutrogena ones
if I was at a Costco I would probably
repurchase these green tea and cucumber
baby wipe I always keep a track of
makeup wipes on my
that's just so you know clean things
wipe down your lips if you get a little
foundation on them whatever these are
the Aiko London hydro eyepatch these are
basically just like little eyepatch
things like an eye mask they put under
your eyes I liked these I kept it on for
about a half-hour and then took them off
didn't notice any like dramatic
difference but I would use them again
all right next we have a couple
different razors the first one I want to
talk about is the tinkle rose is that
really what this is called and this is a
facial razor when I made my Nair video
how to narrow your face I got a lot of
questions about like my facial hair
routine mmm that sounds attractive I do
have a lot of hair I'm Jewish I'm a
hairy person happens to the best of us I
have peach fuzz on my face and I just do
not like it at all my makeup goes on so
much better without it
it just looks better in the Sun you
don't see like a bunch of peach fuzz on
your face I finally like nailed down a
facial hair removal process that really
works for me and I freaking love this
razor you can get these off of eBay or
Amazon
I think maybe just Samsung I'll link it
down below last a long time I literally
only do it like every couple weeks now
doesn't make your face like stubbly or
anything I really like it
then I have the Gillette just a pack of
Gillette razors I use men's razors for
my legs and body because they just work
better for me again I have like coarse
hair I have tons of hair it's really
great alright the internal temp on my
camera it keeps like overheating and
turning off and don't blame me a camera
is hot what was I saying
men's razors they work better they're
cheaper I've just always used him
alright we're getting to the bottom
finally I have a shampoo and a
conditioner here this is the suave
split-end rescue's ranch shampoo I like
this I'm not super picky with my
shampoos they just have to lather I need
to go back to the sulfate free shampoo
because it helps keep my color in longer
I actually really like the suave
professionals line they have a couple
really nice shampoo and conditioners the
rosemary mint or whatever it's called
the mint one I really like this is my
like holy grail shampoo and conditioner
which is mentioned in every single
empties video this is a sulfate free
conditioner rosemary mint I feel like I
will always continue to repurchase these
they just work really well with my hair
so
often healthy feeling and their
sulfate-free all right toothpaste
nothing too exciting this is the Colgate
enamel health whitening toothpaste I was
not really a fan of this I just don't
really like the taste I went back to my
crest 3d white toothpaste I've gotten a
lot of requests for a teeth whitening
routine and I will be doing that I'm
just kind of iffy because the thing that
I use is from the dentist so I don't
know how many of you will be able to get
it but let me know if you still want as
teeth whitening how i whiten my teeth
video-count the Sally Hansen mega shine
topcoat this is one of my favorite
favorite top coats makes your nails dry
superfast makes them super shiny and if
we purchased this a few times the last
empty is this proactive complexion
perfecting hydrator this is just a
moisturizer I really liked this I think
you can buy the Proactiv products
separately on Amazon link it down below
if I can find it but this is a self-help
acid again acne treatment I finished
this a while ago so this is not what
I've been using most recently but I
would go back to this if I had another
one so the box is empty
tell effectively yeah the neighbor just
like going to town with the hammer right
now if you guys liked this video and you
want me to continue to hoard my trash
for your entertainment give it a thumbs
up so I know I did a whole Instagram
post kind of talking about all this but
I just want to let you guys know on here
that videos might be a little bit more
sparse over the next few weeks there's a
lot going on in my life right now and
I'm trying this new thing where I put my
health in my body first so videos might
be more sparse because I'm trying to cut
down on the stress but I wanted to get
this one up for you guys so you have
something to watch this week love you
guys thanks for watching see you my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
