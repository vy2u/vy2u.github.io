all right so today we're going to be
doing a half based test trying out two
different primers one of them is the
most expensive primer I have ever put on
my face this is the girl on maybe you're
right
base primer at this retails for $74 to
get one fluid ounce of product in it and
I'm going to be comparing it to the
Catrice prime and fine beautifying
primer which retails for $7.99 and you
also get one fluid ounce of products in
here let's just take a moment to let
that sink in this primer is $74 this has
to be life-changing this has to be
revolutionary for it to be worth it when
I saw this online I was super drawn to
use little dots this reminds me of said
dots
ice cream like at the mall do they still
have those at its own business and were
those called dot so many questions I
think they were called dots originally I
was just going to do a whole video on
this guy just seeing if it's worth it
and then as soon as I started reading
the claims it reminded me of this the
claims on these are very similar so I
want to read you both of them you guys
will see me put on both I have tried
this primer before a few times that I've
never tried this one so this is the
first impression first going to see if
this was actually worth it and see if
used to wear differently throughout the
day before jump into the claims I do
have a video on the rest of my makeup
right now if you want to see how I got
this look I will leave that video down
below the colour-pop versus anastacio
video each eye is also a different brand
today so let's read about the big kahuna
first does it smooth and color corrects
your skin tone for a radiant complexion
infused with a delicate violet scent
it's formulated with stardust technology
a unique complex encapsulating a
celestial powder that transforms light
invisible to the naked eye into visible
and soft focus perfecting light - what
this is a run-on sentence who wrote this
to blur imperfections and provide
exceptional radiance it's a gel textures
as it melts with rosy pearls to give the
skin a radiant and glowing finish on
neutralizing excess sebum for a
long-lasting matte complexion so this is
supposed to help absorb some of your
oils throughout the day which is very
attractive to me I do have combination
skin that we get pretty oily throughout
the day on my t-zone so this is going to
help soak up some of that oil sign me up
so the oil absorbing thing really drew
me to this I also like that it's
illuminating but it's going to control
your oil or it's supposed to so onto the
country's prime and fine
timer I also have a pole one brand
tutorial using streets products and I
use this primer in that video so the
provide skin with a luminous glow
resulting in a smooth and flawless
looking complexion the soft rose a
primer fortified with nourishing vitamin
E has a silky texture and light
reflecting pearl pigments for an instant
complexion boost can be used underneath
foundation for longer wear or a loan for
a gorgeous glow and I realized in that
description it doesn't say soft focus on
the bottle this does say soft focus
effect long-lasting and naturally
illuminating so I don't know when I read
those two descriptions I thought they
might be similar so here we are you can
get Catrice products at Ulta online I
haven't seen them in store I don't think
buy me but you can't find them online
packaging on this guy is obviously a lot
more luxe I mean you're paying for it
you get a pump it is blast this is just
a squeeze tube bottle so if you're
excited to see how these guys works make
sure you give this video a thumbs up if
you want to see my thoughts on these two
and it's this fricking $74 primer is
worth it you're in the right place just
keep watching of course there is no
beeping for like 20 minutes and as soon
as I hit record the truck starts I'm
just trying to carpe the diem over here
alright so I'm gonna start and really
hope that you can't hear all the
background noise right now so I burnt my
face on a curling iron right here hence
that scar and my skin is not doing so
hot right now so I have the girl on
primer here Inbox this has taken so much
self-control to not open and then the
Catrice prime and fine beautifying
primer is that we're going to do on this
side of my face so I believe these
things are actually supposed to pump out
and that's what time disperses like the
glow so I'm just going to shake this a
little bit I don't think that's really
doing anything but hey I'm going to give
you guys a close-up ooh that looks good
on camera so it's a super liquidy
consistency and I didn't actually get
one of the balls and I supposed to get a
ball mix this up a little bit
unless applies oh it feels very thin
feels like a serum actually smells like
a shampoo I have a little bit of like a
fresh scent so that dries super fast it
feels a little bit like the Nivea poche
zom it has that kind of sticky not quite
as chalky but it does feel a little bit
tacky which is good for a primer
want to get one of these balls out this
is like a dollar a pump okay let's try
to get a ball actually no there's no way
because the opening of this is too small
for a ball to fit through so I think it
actually like breaks it down when you
pump it out right yeah I must yeah okay
now I have a lot I'm Justin brings down
my neck why not oh it smells like
cucumber melon doesn't feel like silicon
or anything it just feels very just
feels like a serum by the way I did
already washed and moisturize my face
obviously haven't primed it but compared
to this side looks a little bit
glowy er not a whole lot actually and
now the tackiness has kind of gone away
let's going on with a Catrice crime and
fine this one has a slight pink tint to
it and also has a thinner consistency
but not quite as thin and CRM like as
the other one you can definitely see
more of a glow and both of these said
that they're supposed to be a soft focus
finish primer
actually smells kind of similar actually
says that this is a violet scent I don't
know if I would call this violet violet
violet is the color all right so let's
look up close see if there's any
difference in my pores or anything so to
me they look exactly the same at this
point except this side the Catrice
primer looks a bit more glowy I actually
think my pores look a little bit more
blurred on the Catrice side the first
foundation I wanted to use one that I
know how it performs and that I love so
I'm using the Catrice Treece Clinique
beyond perfecting foundation and
concealer have a full review on this
product I have to say 0.5 breathes it is
a little bit dark so I'm going to mix in
a tiny bit of my stargazer white
foundation I haven't talked about this
foundation in a while but it is still
one of my favorites it just wears really
well throughout the day it gives you
full coverage it's such a beautiful
finish you just can't go wrong with this
one it is wish Clinique had a better
shade range
like look at that that is was one layer
so they feel like they're blending out
exactly the same one isn't really like
gliding on more than the other one is
but I've got to say now that foundation
is on I do see the globe coming through
on this side more than without a
foundation some reason I can definitely
see on both sides the glow coming
through especially on my forehead this
foundation is pretty satin matte I would
say it's not super luminous the primers
are definitely where that glow is coming
from both sides look pretty much
identical right now I typically don't
powder my face with this foundation it
lasts really well throughout the day on
my skin so we are calling the check-in
time 9:30 it's 9:30 for right now
actually filming another video right now
on the colour-pop eye shadows so I'm
going to do the rest my makeup and I
will be back after I film that video
let's pray to the construction gods that
they are gone when we come back all
right so it is actually now 11 o'clock
that colour-pop video took me an hour
and half to film and I still have to
fill in the swatches for it I'm not
wearing a good swatch shirt right now
but I just wanted to pop in to say
everything blended out buying on tops
blended out exactly the same and I think
they're looking identical right now so
we'll see how both sides were throughout
the day I'm going to check back in with
you guys at the end of the night ok so
it's now 8:30 so a foundation and
everything has been on for 11 hours and
I actually got a migraine in the middle
of the afternoon so I was laying in bed
for a few hours so I did have a hot pack
on both sides of my face actually but
while I was laying down I was trying to
be conscious of the foundation did my
best to not totally ruin everything my
concealer and stuff down here is totally
room because my eye was watering I laid
on this side of my face and then I also
laid on this side for a little bit so
even test maybe but both sides to me are
looking literally identical
I was checking in kind of throughout the
day to see if I saw any differences and
you really can't see any difference I'm
getting a tiny tiny bit of creasing on
both sides on my upper lip my forehead
up here it looks like it's actually worn
off a little bit more but that's usually
what happens with my bangs are right
here I don't think this side looks less
oily at all as far as controlling oil to
me it looks exactly the same I don't
really think just did any major oil
controlling at least with this
foundation and I'm going to try out the
girl
primer with a couple different
foundations before I decide if I want to
keep it or return it right now I mean I
really don't see a difference so I don't
really think it's worth keeping for that
much money but I am going to continue to
try it out if I've tried it out more by
the time this video goes live I'll put
my updated thoughts in the description
box you can see if not I'll try and
update you guys on snapchat as of right
now I think you really could go with the
Catrice one and save about 70 bucks so
if you guys like this video and you
found it helpful make sure you give this
a thumbs up so I know if you're new here
you can join the BAE Rito family and
subscribe it upload monday wednesday
friday at 6 p.m. pacific time love you
