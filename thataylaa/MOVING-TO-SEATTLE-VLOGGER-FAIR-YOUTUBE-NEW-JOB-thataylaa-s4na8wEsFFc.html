know I said kinda way very much so
impromptu video about life and I'm just
going to be updating you guys this is
going to be a super casual vlog kind of
video I just feel like I need to make it
because I've been in Seattle for like
three weeks now two weeks two weeks and
I haven't actually updated you guys
besides being on Instagram and Twitter
so if you're following me there then
you've seen it but not on my youtube
channel so we're just gonna eat some
goldfish and talk about life if you're
like confused about everything right now
I moved to Seattle and I got a job and
I'm here and I'm in this apartment so
this is my new room got my donut pillow
back there you're only gonna be seeing
this background for like a couple weeks
because I have exciting news and I found
an apartment like a permanent one this
apartment was just going to be for
summer like a sublet type thing until I
found a permanent place weird things
happened and life kind of worked out and
I found an apartment really gonna be
seeing this background for like a couple
videos I actually filmed to get ready
with me video last weekend in this
apartment like back there the lighting
was off it was blurry I don't know I was
having major issues I've had this camera
for like a year now and I still don't
know how to do the hyah so or
ysou or whatever that was just kind of
an all-around disaster I don't even know
if I'm gonna be uploading that video and
to bring out the goldfish I started work
a couple weeks ago I'm working in PR
marketing too hot for hair right now
I'm literally so over life right now
that I'm about to use this lightbulb
clip for my hair she's gonna lay back
and relax
kokom in focus this thing is so freakin
hard to Joe so anyways I started my drop
a couple weeks ago it's going super well
to awesome because I can basically work
as much as I want and whenever I want as
long as I get it done so for example
today I left at like 2:00 and went to a
cafe for a few hours now I'm gonna film
and edit and hopefully get this video up
and then I'm going to work for another
like three hours tonight so a super nice
season literally just work however is
best for you but it is really great so
far the people are awesome yeah it's
just kind of crazy like thought of
actually starting your career I know
it's kind of weird
I'm the kind of person that if I can't
put a hundred percent into something I
just won't do it hence why while I was
in Jordan I quit YouTube for like nine
months and took a break because there's
no way that I was going to be able to
regularly upload and things like that so
I've kind of figured I was scheduled I'm
gonna try and do I'm still gonna upload
three times a week for you guys because
I think that uploading regularly is
super important when you have a YouTube
channel and that's just something that I
like to do
however since I'm working like over
forty hours a week now literally the
only time I can film and edit and things
is on the weekends so I'm basically
gonna be filming three videos a weekend
uploading all three during the weekend
and then scheduling them to go up
throughout the week so you guys have
 to watch it feels very weird to me
you doing it that way I feel like it
just got really high-pitched it feels
really weird to me doing it that way
because I feel like I'm not talking to
you guys for like a whole week like
right now I haven't filmed in probably
two weeks because all the videos you
guys have been watching are pre-recorded
this is what I love doing I love
blogging I love interacting with you
guys on social media and it just is
weird when you can't do that every day
like I used to I used to either be
filming or editing every single day life
happens and you got to deal with it
as far as life in Seattle goes Seattle
is awesome so far right now I am not
living in the city like I said we just
found an apartment so super exciting my
best friend Rachel and here's some real
interesting right now
MSN Rachel fingers crossed really 99%
sure right now he got a job in Seattle
so she's moving up here she's my best
friend from college so we found an
apartment in Seattle in a super-good
area amazing price I tweeted some
pictures of it and it is just beautiful
like hardwood floors white walls I have
my own filming room like what the
it's technically a two bedroom and I'm
living in the third bedroom which is
actually the living room I'm basically
gonna be living with like curtains as my
wall but that's totally fine with me I
don't really hear about their kind of
stuff and I have a freaking filming room
like I will trade off for that what
else you guys were asking on Instagram
if I was going to do an apartment tour
of this apartment I don't think so
because like literally this is as moved
in as I'm going to get because I'm
leaving in like a month now yeah I'm
here for like three weeks and then I
move my again to a different
apartment
the one thing I actually had to blog
about which I totally forgot I am like
99% sure I'm gonna be at vlogger fair
which is in Seattle on August 16th or
18th don't quote me on that
I'm kind of deciding whether I should go
or not I'm only going to go if you guys
comment down below and let me know that
you're gonna be there because it's not
there's no point in me going if I'm not
gonna meet subscribers and stuff I mean
obviously it'd be awesome to meet like
the night Knowles are going Rachel
Whitehurst is going like hell oh yeah
comment down below and let me know if
you guys are going to be there and if
you would be interested in meeting each
other that would be like the first
meetup kind of thing I've ever done ever
I didn't live in like a city city before
so I never ran into subscribers or
anything like that and now that I'm in
Seattle and I know that some of you guys
live in Seattle that would be completely
amazing if you came up to me and we took
a picture together I promise it won't be
awkward it'll be amazing yeah let me
know down below if you want me to go to
vlogger fair and if you'll be there like
always if you liked this video and you
want me to continue to do kind of update
videos or talk about and shadow and
screw this video then be sure to give
this video a thumbs up I feel like I
just said video 25 times love you guys
thanks for watching and see you in my
next video ie things I've been loving
lately this fan I know the
lighting and everything like that isn't
that great in this video this is all a
temporary situation right now so just
deal with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
