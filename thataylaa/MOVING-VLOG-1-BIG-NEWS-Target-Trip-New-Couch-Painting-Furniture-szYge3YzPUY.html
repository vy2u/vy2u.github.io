and actually in my new place right now
that I but I'm a homeowner which sounds
so weird to say I have the keys I've
already painted this whole place I've
started doing some small projects and
stuff this is actually the filming room
right here which sounds subtract away
because there's nothing in it and
there's wood floors in this whole place
so I feel like I have some explaining to
do because in the shouting schmooze I
recently posted I kind of said that I've
been looking out for houses and stuff
everything here is so friggin expensive
in Seattle I didn't know what I was
doing I didn't know if I wanted to move
across the country I was kind of just
all over the place what I actually
wanted to do I made an offer on another
place a while ago that now looking back
I'm so glad that that didn't work out
because I just feel like this place is
perfect feels like this one was so right
like just the location the views that'll
natural lighting everything I was
looking for it just worked out and it's
perfect
I love it one of my main reasons for
buying was so that I could rent it out
and actually make money on it okay I
just need to like prop you guys up
somewhere cuz my arms getting tired yeah
there's nothing to prop you up on I'm
not gonna be living in Seattle for the
rest of my life I want to live abroad I
want to live in other places so fine let
me do is instead of just throwing away
money on rent every month it's going
towards an investment and if I want to
go leave for six months or a year or
whatever I can just rent this place out
if I did buy in Seattle it was gonna be
somewhere that was for sure rentable
because I don't see myself staying in
Seattle for like the next few years
straight
I definitely think I'll be back and
forth but I do still want to possibly
live in Germany and just live in other
places for shorter periods of time but
it'll be super nice to have this place
to come back to and just to set up and
everything I have
filming room and then the bedroom so if
I wanted to I could just lock up the
filming room and rent out the bedroom or
whatever far the reason why it took me a
couple weeks to make this video and kind
of announce this is because I've just
been trying to figure out what I want to
share online this isn't just an
apartment where you just have to be
aware of privacy things on YouTube and I
am getting a security system the guys
actually come in today and I'm getting a
couch delivered in like an hour which is
why I'm here right now but you just have
to be more aware when you buy obviously
just been thinking about what I want to
show and what I don't want to show so
I've decided that I'm not going to be
doing a full tour where I show you like
the layout of this place but I will do
smaller videos kind of showing you my
setup in different room and I'm going to
be doing some like remodel projects like
imma be remodeling the bathroom and I
already have repainted the kitchen
cabinets painted and stuff and I want to
be doing like a DIY backsplash kind of
thing so I do want to show you guys
those projects like before and afters
and stuff and I'll probably just make
separate videos on those because I love
a good DIY project I just want to kind
of take my time with this one decorating
it and just soak it all in because I
love doing this stuff and just having my
own place finally that I can literally
do whatever the heck I want to feel so
exciting but just for privacy reasons
I'm not going to be showing you guys
every square inch of this place and
you're actually not going to see the
best parts of it so yeah new journey
hope you guys are excited for more
moving vlogs I'm gonna kind of space
them out I think last time for the move
I did like for moving vlogs I'm gonna
try and break them up even more now
because I just have so many other big
kind of projects I'm doing like the
whole remodels and stuff I've also been
just kind of like taking my time with
phrenic sure and stuff too because I
do more refinishing projects I love
refinishing furniture and I've never had
a space to do it which is why I didn't
do it in my last apartment last time I
really was into refinishing furniture
was in college when I did have kind of a
space to do it I would just would like
use our living room but that's like a
side hobby of mine ready redone some
chairs and a table that I got off of
offer up so I'm gonna include something
up gonna do in this block because I I've
just been kind of blogging all over the
place which is why I have short hair at
the beginning of this and you guys will
see some clips of long hair so I was
filming before but I was gonna pop in
whatever footage I have I've been taking
clips of like packing up in the old
place in this video and then the next
ones will be just more of the moving
process but timeline so what I'm filming
this is June 1st I'm also filming
foundation Friday today which so I you
guys will see this again but I'm go to
Chicago and then the day after I get
back from Chicago in the middle of June
is when the official move happens like
the movers come in everything but then
my lease in the old place isn't up until
end of June so just basically have a
couple weeks where I'll still be paying
rent in the old place that I'll be moved
over here so I'm going to be in this
place in the middle of June the day
after the movers come my parents are
flying to Seattle to help me like unpack
everything and hang stuff and put stuff
together so that'll be super nice it's
just been a lot of random phone calls a
lot of paperwork I've been like I don't
really know hum functioning I've been
not really sleeping been dealing with
the house stuff and then still trying to
get three videos a week but all good
things and I'm excited for you guys to
just be with me on this thing okay so
we're gonna do an impromptu shop with me
at Target rage is ready to go back there
you look comfy it's like 9 p.m. on a
Sunday night Sunday night Sunday night
so the best time to go to Target and I'm
playing here we go we're in the home
section
our target is kind of shitty here this
is the extent of the home section I
think I really like this plant that
looks actually healthy
I like the basement ooh pretty
Oh
ooh ooh I like this Rach this would be a
cool like vanity or coffee table thingy
oh yes I'll just spray paint that though
and get it at Goodwill I got this lippy
those girls just ran times me and then
that one's kind of smelled like
sunscreen huh oh whoa wait this is new
look they have actual home things now oh
this is the person hand I think this is
um what's her face is HGTV lady
what's that thing do you have files to
file what does an adult-adult
know what Jagan has char Pete I really
like these letter board things he can
like write whatever you want that's
actually a pretty good place okay I
actually need more than espresso pots
but I don't think they sell pods here
I'm gonna seek your egg stuff I feel
like no we're actually cells a Nespresso
pods that's my issue let me know down
below where you guys buy an espresso I
feel like you have to order it from them
online or just kind of thing but ratio
these are supposed to be kids plates but
we're bringing our cart full of
[Laughter]
you're just getting whiteboards for work
but how freak employ these never seen
these before
they're like chalkboard colored pencils
being organized and things so I usually
get the method of purpose cleaner that
stuff rocks I think I'm gonna try this
one honest
coastal surf haven't tried anything from
honest company yet
registering hallo dot meanwhile I'm
trying these inside the best cookies
ever we used to go through like packs
that using college Geum everyone did you
camp you know what I'm talking about if
you guys haven't tried these the pretzel
Bart things are so good I don't even
like chocolate and these are bomb oh
they have coconut hell yeah peanut
butter this target clothes section kind
of looks like a show but I came in
forever 21 little bit I think this
universal thread brand is new they have
some cute stuff I really like this shirt
I really like this one but they don't
have any smalls let's keep them so if
you have small feet target actually has
really good kid shoes I'm wearing the
same works right now he's are like the
fake works I'm gonna get a replacement
that's how obsessed I am of these
there's 16 bucks and I like the comfy
issues ever okay so this is my first DIY
project in the new place so I got this
really cool kind of mid-century table
dining table off of offer up with metal
chairs for like 70 bucks the table and
the four chairs so I'm scraping these
legs white and then the actual table is
this like really heavy wood top that I
can't get out of my car by myself and
then the chairs I'll show you so then
these are the chairs they're all just
like grey I'm gonna majorly scrub them
down obviously before expert opinion and
then I'm thinking I'm gonna do these
white as well I'm kind of going back and
forth between white and black but I'm
thinking white
I had to restock on some spray paint so
I have one coat on that chair three
chairs to go so I've already packed a
couple boxes here this is all just
bathroom stuff I really got to start
working on this room so that's what I'm
gonna try and tackle right now got to
pack all these boxes I think what my
strategy is gonna be is to just tape
them off and then cushion them really
well so they don't break in there
because if I try and unpack and repack
all this makeup and reorganize it it's
just gonna be a waste of time so I'm
just gonna hope that the containers
don't break basically I feel like I've
gotten a strategy down now with packing
where I just use my sweatshirts to like
pack in between sweatshirts scarves
winter stuff just use all that and got
my laptop set up there I'm gonna put on
some married at first sight that I'm
still addicted to and hopefully crank
out some packing for the next two hours
so hello here's the kitchen so when I
moved in here it was like a really ugly
color shade of tan
I'm not into tan at all like get rid of
every ounce of tan so I repainted
everything white I actually have a black
accent wall here's the living room this
is the black accent wall I'm gonna have
a white fireplace against there I'm
gonna have the TV hung and then some
cool like wood things against here with
plants and then the couch that I'm
getting delivered is gonna be going
right here so they should be here
hopefully I mean they gave me like a
five hour window I got it from Ikea sofa
bed so I have more space for people to
sleep on when people visit and stuff but
it's like a I'll show you guys that when
it comes but I'm gonna put that against
that wall and then probably get some
like tan leather kind of chairs to go
right here I'm just gonna show you guys
little pieces that I already have so
this mirror hello I got from Target and
these round mirrors are not cheap
they're gonna be like 200 bucks if you
get them online so I actually found this
one on target I think it was around 40
or 50 bucks so that I think I'm gonna
hang this is like the dining room
obviously have a lot of right here
so these chairs are what I was working
on so I'll include a clip of that now
but this stuff is all just piled from
the painters I need to eat lunch I got
this Red Robin
salish it's like chicken and Caesar with
little pasta things that I picked up in
shoreline when I justice at HomeGoods
I'm like starvin what time was it it's
2:40 right now but here's a little shot
of the kitchen
I'm going to do a full-on kitchen before
and after probably a separate thing once
it's all done
but basically what I'm doing here is i'm
gonna DIY these subway towels i got i
got these off of amazon they're like the
peel and stick kind they got really good
reviews and they looked good in photos
they're a little bit smaller than I was
picturing but I think it'll still look
good so I'm gonna black subway tile
behind there and then I got this cool
wooden shelf thing like three shelves
that are gonna go above the sink right
there and then I got a cool kind of like
a different lighting pendant thing that
I'm gonna hang so these were all dark
wood it looks so much better white and
it's so much more bright and open and
then I got different knobs and then I
still need to put the other ones I have
like the half circle kind of black knobs
and I need to drill on here and I take
that down that'll be a dad project and
have them hang a pendant light so the
style want to do in this place is kind
of more like farmhouse but still really
clean and crisp in a little bit like
mid-century so kind of a mix of stuff
the credenza thing I got is definitely
more farmhouse I got it off of offer up
eventually what I want to do is knock
down this wall in that wall and open it
up right here contractors in Seattle are
booked until fall 2019 so I'm just gonna
do what I can with it for now and then
eventually I'm just gonna like totally
remodel this and probably do it like a
shiplap well to that goes into that room
so I just got this trash can from home
goods and it's just like cute little you
know has the press thing
the laminate stained from the previous
owners they obviously had a red here
which is fine because I want to put a
rug there too eventually I'll redo the
flooring in here but I don't feel like
that's a top priority right now I'm just
gonna put the rug in the same spot
anyways it doesn't really matter but
this coffee table I got off of offer up
for like 40 bucks it actually looks a
bit lighter online so I might just
resell it because it's a little bit
darker than what I wanted the lighting
I'm good
all new little lighting and pendants and
things tomorrow I got someone off of
TaskRabbit to help me put together some
outdoor furniture I'll have a link for
TaskRabbit down below I think you can
get your first I think you get $20 off
or something but they can help you
assemble furniture garden do a lot of
stuff I don't want to have like 50,000
things for when my parents come because
I already have enough projects I feel
like for them and then these boxes are
giants I just want to get these out so
when the movers come there's like space
to put all the boxes these giant white
pillows I found I think I've got these
at yeah TJ Maxx 40 bucks for two pretty
good these are giant so I'm gonna use I
got a new bed and it has some like
storage the platform bed so I can put
storage and stuff underneath it and it
doesn't have a headboard so I'm gonna
make like this big giant pillow kind of
headboard but I got an outdoor fire pit
which I'm so freakin excited for there's
gonna be it so nice for the summer
cannot even explain how excited I am
even with the blinds closed right now
like I have all the blinds closed and
the lighting is amazing I'm gonna shoot
to edit two videos I already clean the
floors in here so it's ready for the
couch I'm trying out the Bona try to go
as you guys on Twitter and a bunch of
you said Mona is the best laminate floor
cleaning so I bone ed it sounds a little
wrong I didn't realize that these
actually show when this table slipped
over so I need to unscrew these and
spray-paint these white two to match the
chairs and then I got cushions that I
need to grab they're my car that I think
might have been too big so I need to
measure this and make sure the cushions
are gonna fit but I am gonna reupholster
them like the big checker print black
and white I need to bring my screwdriver
back so I can spray that
I could definitely just go out to my car
and actually get the cushions right now
but that sounds like a lot of work so
the couch just have arrived I don't know
why I thought it was gonna be assembled
it's IKEA so of course not but
definitely still in boxes so these have
a pad he's got him out of the car it's
got these off in the Amazon they're
memory foam tiny bit big but don't
really want to like hang it so I'm going
to be free upholstery means like I
didn't keep that brick these have no Oh
cat they've ties tiny bit big but I
don't think that looks bad at all once
the cute fabric is on there we'll be
golden actually doesn't look about it
just the black whew but like sinks in so
it's now later the same night it just
did some Jillian Michaels right here
packed I'll show you guys some packing
progress and little bit I just made some
dinner
got some Brussels sprouts cauliflower
rice which is so good get the frozen
Whole Foods cauliflower rice some salmon
have some leftovers for lunch tomorrow
it's a couple days later I think since I
last saw you guys I'm obviously back
here and made some major progress got
some printers s-step but some printer
stuff set up I'm gonna show you guys a
couple of updates and I'll probably wrap
up this vlog and start a second moving
vlogs I feel like I have a lot of
footage already but here she is here's
the couch I'm in love what I ended up
having to do if you've ever looked for a
white slipcover sofa bed I think there's
about three on all the internet that
exists so what I ended up doing was
getting the IKEA home son here's what it
is home send sofa bed they don't make
the white color anymore so what I did
was get it in light gray and then I
actually found the slipcover this exact
one off of ebay for like a hundred bucks
and slipcovers sofas I found are not
cheap all the other ones like on Joss
and main and stuff were literally like
$1,700 so ended up getting this one for
a really good price
and then I just got the white slipcover
off of ebay so this pulls out into a
sofa bed this sofa is a friggin rock so
fair warning if you were thinking about
getting this sofa it looks awesome but
it's definitely a firmer sofa which most
sofa beds are because they have the
mattress and all that stuff under there
but there's actually like a huge storage
thing underneath here it only came with
those back pillows and then I ordered
five other pillows just to make it look
like really cushy and stuff but I think
what I'm actually gonna do is get a twin
mattress topper I have a mattress topper
for when people sleep on the sofa bed
that'll store underneath it but for the
actual top of the sofa when it's like
this I think I'm gonna get a twin one
just off the Amazon like one of those
three-inch things and then put fabric
over it and just like tuck it in the
sides so that it'll because she on top
because it really is like super hard but
it looks awesome I love the look of it
and then here we have a new addition I
am so in love with this thing so this
credenza buffet whatever you want to
call it I got off of offer up I think I
might actually paint the top of this
black just because I have a lot of wood
going on I'll show you guys but the
dining table is also that same color
when I hang that mirror above there get
some cool like plants and stuff instead
of painting it I might just use a black
table runner we'll see how it looks I
also might be wallpapering this wall
behind here I think that would look
really cool this thing I put together
the other night I need to flip it
because it's like backwards right now
but I got this off of Wayfarer I want to
say I'll link it down below but super
cute fits perfect once I flip it I got a
cute little like vintage retro relooking
white microwave that I'm gonna stick
probably on that one right there and
then this just adds extra counter space
cuz the kitchen is pretty small by the
way I don't think the positioning of the
couch is going to stay here we'll see
because my vision was to do the white
fireplace and then mount the TV I did
get the mount that it can turn out so I
could technically leave the couch here
we'll see the positioning once all the
stuff is in here but I am gonna resell
that coffee table I just don't really
not feeling it here more officiating is
this I think I did the other day when I
was going to reupholster them
I had the wrong stables so I had to go
back home get the right staples what
staple gun do you know takes light duty
staples but this one so I might try and
crank these out but I also need to get a
video scheduled for tonight and I don't
have Wi-Fi here yet I'm a rain check
these again cuz I think I'm gonna run
out of time I think what I'm gonna do is
actually save these for the next vlog so
I'll show you guys are you posting them
in the next vlog and wrap this one up
here yeah hope you guys are excited for
more moving blogs I'm excited to film
them if you enjoyed this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up I love you
guys thanks for watching see you in my
