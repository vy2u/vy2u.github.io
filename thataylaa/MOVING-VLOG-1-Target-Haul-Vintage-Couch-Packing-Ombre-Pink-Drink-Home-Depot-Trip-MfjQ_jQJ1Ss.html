all right but it is Saturday afternoon
and I figured I would start out this
moving vlog because I'm just running
errands I totally forgot my memory card
I brought my vlog camera this is my
class eeeh Old Navy sucks
case but of course I forgot my memory
card so I'm just on the iPhone right now
I'm gonna show you guys when I get home
my progress on like packing and stuff
for those of you who don't know or a new
here I'm moving apartment so I'm
starting to do everything I've been
selling pretty much all of my friend
sure and I'm getting all new stuff so I
actually found this awesome vintage like
mid-century modern kind of leather couch
on offer up for like 200 bucks and I'm
actually going to stain the leather kind
of like a mustard yellow color right now
I think I want to make it like a dark
brown since I'm doing a lot of like
whites and plants and kind of bohemian
I've been finding such good stuff on
offer up and then getting pretty much
all my furniture from there I'm still in
the hunt for barstools I really want
like wicker barstools and I found these
perfect ones in Tacoma which is like an
hour away and I was going to drive and
go get them today but then I woke up
with the migraine feeling super should
be this morning I just started feeling
better like an hour ago it's like 3 p.m.
right now but now I feel great so that's
good I want to go to Target and then I
also need to go to Best Buy because my
cannon actually just completely crapped
out on me yesterday at the Canon 70d and
it's like notorious for breaking the
motherboard I've already sent it in once
for repairs and that was when it was
under warranty and now it's not under
warranty anymore so we're going to go
get the ATD from Best Buy because I
desperately need to film so if I go get
the new camera I can film tonight when I
get back and then I also need to go to
Home Depot to get more losing boxes that
I was only going to need like 10 but I
totally underestimated the amount of
 that I have so much I feel
like you don't realize until you pay
there's a beep you didn't come down here
I wanted to do the cheap please
so getting the camera was a success I
decided not to go to Target because I
don't really need anything there and you
know I was going there cause its target
I'm going to go check out Home Depot to
get boxes and they might have the
leather stains they might not need to go
to hobby lobby's
gotta love hockey Luffy
so found so while they're diabetic on
lines if you need like six of these so I
can understand the past and get the stop
proper type David or coconut it's like
30 bucks for own container they're seven
four four ounces yeah so it's the next
day I should probably close the window
I'm pretty sure this luggage is going to
be like random moving clips not doing
like full-day vlogs or anything so I
wanted to blog because I got a really
exciting delivery it's behind me right
here so this is the vintage couch that I
got off of offer up that I was telling
you guys about a guy and his friend just
dropped it off me I since I can't fit it
into my car like how I got a jeep
thinking that I'll be able to move stuff
and it's so tiny that literally nothing
fits in it so it looks different in
every life is I feel like this is the
most accurate because the natural light
is faced this way so it's like this
mustard yellow kind of color I almost
like it this color I don't know if i
100% want to stain it because the new
place has gray floors so I feel like
with gray floors my dark wood coffee
table this might actually look really
cool but let me show you the front
because I'm so in love with this but
here's what the front looks like living
room is a mess right now because
obviously packing and moving and then
here's just show you guys this yesterday
I don't think I did here's all my moving
progress so far so I have a new rug
that's going to go in the living room I
think packed up about 10 boxes so far as
a bunch of clothes in there my dad's
going to help me install this closet
system in the new place since there's
like a walk-in closet this amazing also
show you guys right now he's fishing the
couch I'm getting sidetracked for being
vintage this is an awesome condition
there's some scraping on the back but
the leather is super comfy when you sit
in it it like squishes down it's a
really comfy couch and it has a really
cute like mid-century modern kind of
legs on it I just love it if anything
I'm definitely going to sand and stain
the legs just so it looks a little bit
more polished but I just ordered leather
cleaner off of Amazon so I can wipe it
down but look at how cute this is
I just love it I think it'll be the
perfect size too so I might just wait to
see how it looks in the new place and
then stain it if I need to or want to so
the way that my place is shaped you guys
will see there's like a spot for a
kitchen island kind of wanted to do a
taller bar kind of
table and so I found this perfect one
also on offer up and I'm obsessed to the
back of it so you can see the two
shelves here if you look on this side if
you can see kind of you can kind of see
there's like two pull
drawers right here with little silver
hardware this is actually cratenbarrel I
think those originally $800 maybe $600
and I got it for 200 on offer up this is
like in perfect condition they only had
it for a year it's like pretty much a
new condition still in the hunt for bar
stools I just keep checking but I really
want to do wicker so it ties together
the whole like bohemian thing in the
kitchen to add a really cute like
macrame table runner thing film to
videos this morning that feels good at
Sunday today by the way pretty much have
two weeks worth of videos pre-recorded
so that feels amazing because I'm pretty
sure I'm going to New York and then like
a day after I get back and move and then
my parents are coming and with work and
everything else so just need to get like
super head on videos but I want to show
you guys this closet because I made
major progress on this so this was all
filled with my like hygiene hair
products everything so I cleaned all
this out this is basically stuff that
I'm just keeping I'm just going to pack
in a suitcase
this closet still needs some major work
I haven't even touched this thing really
tough the closet is my roommates and
then actually mine like this help I over
here with all this stuff mines that all
needs to get packed up too and then my
room is a hot mess because I still need
to film throughout all this oh I've
makeup everywhere when I moved out of
the office space
I just kept all the makeup in there and
taped up the drawers and it work totally
fine so that saves like hours of packing
and unpacking for me so I'm just going
to do that all in there is boxes of
makeup to donate /keep for giveaways and
stuff I have more back there too and
those two things so that's my little
update on the packing cool it a lot but
still a lot to do and like 90% of the
stuff in the kitchen is mine so I
stopped to pack up all the kitchen stuff
too but coming together okay that works
there we go so I am headed out to Kent
Washington right now which is like 45
minutes away because I found the perfect
two barstools I feel like this is not a
flutter angle I found the perfect two
barstools
I'm actually going to reupholster the
cushions and like a faux dark brown
leather kind of thing so I'll show you
guys do not I don't know if that will be
in this vlog
the next one but I just went to
Starbucks because I really want to try
ombre pink drink look at this thing so
pretty I like don't want to mix it it's
so pretty as I get to take a Instagram
photo first classic but the afternoon
right now I was just working in the
morning I think there's a Joanne's out
there or like a Hobby Lobby so I'm going
to try and find the leather fabric for
the barstools out there found a good one
on Amazon but I don't really want to
wait the two weeks delivery for it so
I'm just going to see if they have any
so I do not like the normal pink drink
it's way too sweet for me but I prayed
this one was a little bit more tangy
because I think it has like lime juice
in it or something which I love lime
smells like bubblegum what the heck here
we go oh
what does this taste like it tastes like
pepto-bismol would not recommend but you
know I'm gonna drink holding oh this is
a weird taste like it kind of grows on
you the morning cute drinking it so
that's what it looks like it's already
white which I was actually going to
spray paint whatever chairs I got white
and I was looking for a wicker and then
I have this gold unless you guys can see
that there's like gold detailing on the
bottom that ring and then that's the
ugly green cushions and I'm going to
reupholster to like a brown leather so I
think they're going to look really cute
and I'm getting two for 25 bucks so
literally $13 chairs pretty much let's
go explore ken I've never been to KITT
alright the 217 p.m.
I just got the barstools they look so
cute I'm so excited about it and the
waiting was so nice there she's probably
like 80 she was so sweet we talked for a
few minutes it's really pretty out here
super green trees everywhere I've seen
like five red jeeps come by in like 30
seconds of sitting here I found Oh
Joanne's four miles away so I'm going to
go there I just cleaned down the couch I
got this leather cleaner off of Amazon
it got really good reviews and it worked
totally fine I feel like it actually
made it like a bit more shiny and stuff
and a ton of dirt came off so that was
kind of gross and then I also just
packed up this closet this was
completely filled with stuff I wanted to
update you guys on the whole fabric
Joann Fabric situation all their vinyl
was like $33 or something around there
over 30 bucks for freaking sake love it
rope ended up just ordering the one on
Amazon it was six bucks per yard I'll
link it down below we got that and then
I just two days shipped it should be
getting that in the mail in a couple
days so I'll definitely show you guys on
the blog when I get it I have been
packing for the last like four hours now
and I'm at that point where I literally
just don't know what to do next I keep
staring at the floor like look at all
this I got the closets done pretty
much I really thought this was all my
stuff's all the closets cleared out I
still have some stuff down here and on
my suitcases so many boxes now they're
just piling up so I just wanted to chat
with you guys and give you a little bit
of an update it's June 25th so I leave
for New York's tomorrow's Monday League
for New York Tuesday morning and this
weekend was pretty rough so I had fans
on like 85 degrees tiddly this weekend
health wise has been pretty past
three days I think I've had about five
hours or I'm functioning right now I
have pain all up my left side I just
packed up the kitchen because I have to
I mean frustrated whole week and
obviously supposed to feel like three
videos going to turn to packing done and
just frustrating when you literally have
no control over your body literally any
patch of time I have where I can have
the lights on from packing for the move
or editing or do
something because do not have enough
time right now usually hoping I'm going
to be functioning in New York it's
always extra hard when it's like 3 or 4
days back-to-back of feeling like
complete because all you want is a
break like all I want is one day to feel
good right now alright I'm going to go
I'll see you guys in the next clip so
it's the next morning and I woke up
feeling decent
thank God I can feel it coming back on
but right now I'm doing ok
so I woke up at 6:30 so that I could
film low still feeling ok so that filmed
a video and I did some packing a huge
donate pile that I'm about to go drop
off at Mary's Place which is in Seattle
the boxes are all under there I have ten
just in this little area and then I
still take down the shelves and spackle
and fill in the walls how I still have
to do the bathroom I have to like go
kids bathroom stuff and I came up with
this video idea last night that I'm
really excited for so I might try and
film a second video if I still feel ok
in the afternoon but I need to get
everything ready to go for New York
because I leave at 4 a.m. tomorrow
morning so this is like my big last day
of packing and getting everything really
together let's do this trying to take
down this IKEA shelf and kind of failing
whipping out the big guns we have a
stripped screw folks
oh hell yes movies don't need that any
more power to the people special time
all right I am in the new apartment I'm
so excited movers came this morning at
7:30 a.m. they just finished at about
11:30 so it took them four hours it is
90 degrees in here literally it's
frickin hot I'm not going to show you
guys a tour in this video because I'm
going to do a separate like empty
apartment tour even though I should
everywhere already have no idea if I
even have enough footage for this vlog I
don't know if this was even mildly
entertaining but this is just going to
be like a few part moving vlogs videos
does that make any sense it's going to
be like a part 1 part 2 part 3 I've been
so all over the place class couple days
out and remember what I've logged in
this vlog right now I need to finish
unpacking my car they brought up
everything but I still the plant
stuff in my car and then I think I need
to go to Target to get like paper towels
soap and all that kind of stuff for
tonight and I don't have shower curtains
either so need to get those right in
there in the target something to lug
thank you
oh now it's only $90 okay where's the
late modern which delivers Pacific I
don't know if I want to commit to land
right now a lot of decision making or
like that so it's all good three four
yeah this looks my glacÃ© not Ursula's
like man it's really disappointing
bathroom counters are white marbles I
think I'm going to go with like wood
okay guys I'm just like having a moment
right now so I felt like I needed to
blog and document this getting slightly
emotional and I was unpacking and
putting away food I started putting it
on half of the fridge and then realize I
don't have a roommate anymore it's just
crazy that I'm in my own place right now
their space it's beautiful I feel so
grateful and I worked friggin hard for
this and just feel so good but as you
can see adenosyl on Asian I went to
Target I had to get a bunch of like
basic things but I also got some
exciting things and I push to put on
Instagram you guys said you wanted to
see a home haul do I need to close that
window
I also the fit house with the fan on
down my thoroughness was interesting how
do you know man I've been away for like
24 hours of billing so I think I want to
show you guys the target holes as it
shifts on the stuff back there and I
need to use some of it tonight like I
got stuff in the bathroom I shower
curtains and stuff close the window
turned off the fan not so much it love
you guys
so basically have like four bags from
Target and then I also have a bunch of
stuff from home goods and just stuff
that I bought online I don't know if I'm
going to show that in this video we'll
see how long it takes me to get your
target but I have a bunch of stuff that
I order online before the move okay just
got a thumbnail and boy there's no back
back there
like I don't wanted to get new towels I
kind of was like if I see ones that I
like I'll get them it's not all just use
ones I have but I found these Nate
Berkus ones which is my favorite line at
Target F use white towels I got two of
them and they have this like black trim
right here it is C a bath man that
targets that I like some
check out rocks probably here's the
other channels oh let me smell good so
you guys will see with the bathroom
looks like in the next vlog but it has
white and gray like marble countertops
with black and then instakills drawers
and everything underneath it which is
right up my alley but the walls are tan
you guys know how I feel back in but I
have to say it's kind of growing on me
like I can do the creams now or I could
only do like solid white but the
cabinets in the kitchen are like the
light tan I can deal with tan now I feel
like it adds a little bit of warm
anyways what I'm getting at is this hand
towel is like cream and a little bit of
tan in there but it has these tassels
which I love we got one of you because I
really like getting different type of
help so I figured I'd get some other
ones that rocks but this was the tan
walls without look cute and tie and like
the white towels and everything and then
shower curtains I really like the whole
bohemian but went like touches them gold
and would kind of look so I got this
shower curtain I'm not totally in love
with it I'm gonna test out and see if I
like it but I feels like little gold
triangles on it and now I think it might
look really cute with this and like
couple gold things on the countertops
and then while we're on the bathroom
bandwagon or I did not like wood I
didn't like warm colors at all
but I've been really into with this is
like schools oh this color wood is kind
of like what my coffee table is going to
be and then just matching toothbrush
holder then simple tie it together will
be on the counter I think that's all the
bathroom stuff my kitchen table is like
a bar stool bar feeding pen situation
and I got this table runner on world
market looks white on the website when I
got it in real life it's like straight
up pan so I got these two table mats I
have the president has bolded here I'm
going to do this super to you before I
actually might use this underneath this
thing
they didn't have any cute water what's
called housing so under did track didn't
have any cute one so I might actually
just plop this under the
tract that'll look really cute on the
house it was soaked with water but there
is a dishwasher here but certain things
I just like to wash my hand it's just
nice to have one we like a dark grey
chrome kind of color I got a sticky bra
super excited lighter I actually used up
all my bath and Bodyworks candles horn
hoop pretty crowd
it is totally linked on the name of
yourself there we go an awesome Downey
of fusion volcanic will miss dryer
sheets
I actually don't simply use dryer sheets
that they help make the scent of your
laundry smell like staying in clothes
and I love that I'm really fresh I got
some more refills wet cloth Weber
refills just enough target brands have
my slipper I'm going to slip for the
whole floors before I open up my
mattress tomorrow

try and find the kitchen trash can and
ask someone and we still can't find them
so I'm just going to order one on Amazon

haven't tried to get this is the
anniversary blend but those dark rose so
I got it this is Pete's coffee has no
idea what box like your eggs enjoy

headed and like feel like I'm going to
pass out if I don't have enough food in
my system which I these just like their
own my birds wouldn't happen an
emergency which I feel like happens way
too often
okay this deodorant smells so good this
is Old Spice timber with mint I can't
remember if it was Old Spice or the
other one was the other man he better
gave me a really bad rash but I guess
we'll find out again this one is smelled
really good it smells like a guy Bueller
but it was a mint in it it smells a
little bit more like fresh and feminine
almost if I'm so set about Bloody Mary
Mix I've been on a Bloody Mary
kicked lately and I looked at the
ingredients on this one compared to the
other one I think it's like mister
cheese they cut out and this one has
actual tomato puree not just like the
concentrate like juice stuff my friends

gonna attempt to make Bloody Mary we'll
see a shower curtain hooks cleveland's

cleaners that actually disinfect and
clean you guys use this and then a
multi-purpose cleaner to make it smell
good or what do you do let me know down
below we can your multipurpose cleaners

nice bottle I love this packaging this
is ham so with the method brand

soap to just a show from Miss Myers if

bit it smells very medicinal which I
like smells like ass bleach in here

little boring bracing for silver we're
debating between the wood one and this
