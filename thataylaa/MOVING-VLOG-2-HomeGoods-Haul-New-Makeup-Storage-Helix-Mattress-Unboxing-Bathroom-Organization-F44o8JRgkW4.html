alright guys so it is morning number one
in the new apartment the Comcast guy
just came and the Internet's already
broken but I felt like actually getting
ready this morning so I haven't worn
like full face makeup and like we feels
like but last night I slept on the couch
this is where I slept I did some laundry
last night and just watched all the
cheats and everything and then slept on
the couch but tonight I'm super excited
because I get to sleep on my new
mattress over there look at it in this
tiny box how cool is that it's one of
those things that like expands so I'm
going to show you guys unboxing it vlog
is going to be like part two of the
moving vlog video but I'm going to the
mattress unboxing and then I have a
bunch of stuff from like home goods and
random things that I got online to show
you guys and then also just give you the
tour of the actual apartment obviously
there's everywhere just going to be
like an empty apartment or just got
coffee and I got coffee I mean has one
of my double shot expressos I can't find
the box with my Keurig so we're sticking
with this for an out let's unbox the
thing I'm hoping that this is a
one-person task I can do it we got this
so I don't think I explained this but my
bed is actually going to be on the floor
right here I didn't want to get a box
spring or anything because you can
actually put these matches directly on
the floor if you have a hard surface
through the living room but the
technical bedroom is where my office
filming space is going to be because
that's where the most stuff and I wanted
to sleep where there's like a bunch of
like natural light coming in and it just
felt nice and open here but I'm actually
going to curtain it off with like a mesh
drapey kind of curtain thing so it'll
look really cool once it's all together
sure exposition so this portion of log
is sponsored by helix mattress so thank
you to them for collaborating with me on
this video super Saiya chatting out but
super cool because you go online and you
like a sleep quiz I'll show you guys but
your mattress is completely customizable
to you like literally until the cute
packaging is like sleep in the spa
oh cool they tell you how to actually
unroll this thing to give you
step-by-step instruction pull on the
plastic tab to unroll your mattress from
the rest of the packaging unroll again
we're gonna unroll yeah
I think this side is down yeah it looks
like the white side goes up then it says
they carefully cut the final layer of
plastic avoiding the mattress itself I
can already hear it like expanding I
feel this kind of thing well you do that
oh my god
windward side of my foot dude that thing
just blew up and should think this is
the Horde yup that was super fast you've
got literally just about 5-10 minutes
there we go we have a mattress so as
you're supposed to give it about 45
minutes to rest and do its thing and
continue like blowing up to its full
capacity super tempted to sit on this
thing right now but I'm going to give it
45 minutes what time is it right now
okay it's 10:50 a.m. I'm going to give
you about an hour I'm going to show you
guys how you like customize this thing
so I got a full-size under a thousand
bucks for like a good quality mattress
is awesome also of a 10 year warranty
it's made in the US and you can also
test it out for a hundred nights to see
if you like it you take this little quiz
thing okay you know what's weird I'm now
in the next age bracket that makes me
feel old
so it's customized to your like height
and weight as well all my personal info
for you so this is what I thought was
really cool in unique you fill out your
sleeping preferences and also like your
pain levels and any pressure points and
stuff and I'm someone who has chronic
pain neck pain and when I wake up in the
morning six out of seven days a week my
neck is totally messed up and it usually
turns into a migraine so my masterís
was definitely probably not helping
before because I literally had a hundred
dollar mattress that I got like a
blowout saying it like that thick is
pretty shitty so on the quiz thing they
asked you like what level of pain you
wake up with in the morning which I
thought was really cool and it's
supposed to be like customized for your
body so I'm really hoping that this
helps but if you're someone who has
chronic pain I don't know maybe
investing in a good mattress could help
since you do spend like eight hours a
day on that thing when I'm asleep I
sleep pretty well I just wake up feeling
shitty so I'm going to give it like a 4
you can say what kind of firmness you
like Glen once you drop the quiz they
tell you your results you can see what
kind of mattress they customized for you
add it to cart and you're good to go I'm
set
an alarm because I'm Way too excited to
sit on this thing oh it feels nice I
just want to sit on it
I felt the tribal self-control so I just
finished editing the first moving vlog
I'm exporting it right now and I'm going
to upload it and it is now time to sit
on the mattress the moment has come here
we go I'm so excited
woo woo this is a nice amount of oh yeah
I feel like this will be really good for
my neck in fact because it's firm but
the top is cushy if I make them do you
see I'm still sinking down but when I
lay back it's still comfortable like
your body still kind of like curves to
it that's what I'm talking about so nice
I'm excited to sleep on this tonight
imma let you guys know how it goes in
the morning but helix did give me a $50
coupon code for you guys if you want to
try it out it's $50 off the code is the
tailor leave a link for he looks down
below so far honestly this feels very
nice it's kind of the exact firmness and
feel I was going for so I want to show
you guys these two things because since
I'm doing like a floor bed I'm like a
bohemian situation I thought this would
be cute I've kind of like a nightstand
so I think I'm actually going to put
this over here and then I got both of
these from home goods will just go
perfect with everything and then this
tray I'm just going to sit on top and
put like probably cute plant or a little
candle thing and then this is where I
can have like my water and all that my
parents are coming in like a week so I'm
gonna have my dad help me hang the
drapey things boxes everywhere right now
ignore that but I've been doing laundry
so I can have all the bedding ready to
go so just wash my duvet cover and it is
so nice having a washer and dryer in my
apartment I've never had that before
literally life-changing like you can do
as many loads of laundry as you want
it's great at any time of the day I'm
going to show you guys the little haul
why do I look blue right now cuz I
actually need to wash them with things
in here to put on the bed alright so
let's do a little haulage shall we so I
have a string at home goods bag I
actually don't know how much is from
home goods in here I feel like most of
it's from a random places on the
Internet I need to put this guy in the
wash but I got a new duvet cover set
just because I felt like it was time my
other one isn't super super white
anymore just as you know what time and
where it's usually change of color a
little bit
BRR I think it has got a basic yeah I
think I was boring and just got a super
basic white duvet cover and set that I
got off of Amazon but some about really
good reviews I just take it out some
that need to wash it annoys I was going
to do like a roughly kind of one but I
thought with the curtains and then I'm
going to do like a bunch of decorative
pillows I just thought it might be too
much so I just wanted to go with a
comfortable stock ooh this feels pillow
sauce you get the duvet cover and two
pillow shams I'll link anything I can
find online that I'm talking about down
below in the description box so the
drapey thing I'm talking about over the
bed is technically a mosquito net I got
it off of Amazon some people put two
pictures of bears hanging up and it
looks really good this is just a Home
Collection mosquito net holdings from
home guys I got these kitchen towels
which I am in love with I love the
tassels white great stripes super cute
this will go really well in the kitchen
and then I also got these kitchen towels
these are just like linen ones a little
bit darker gray I thought these would be
cute hung together just like layered or
something by the way if you're in
Seattle the home goods in Bellevue is
amazing it's brand-new and they had a
Shoshanna staff that's where I got those
two things from - I got this little
kitchen what's called oven mitt I love
that this is woven it just looks really
like cozy this I totally forgot I got
until just now this is so pretty I
thought this would look you on that or
just on the kitchen table or coffee
table whatever it was the table runner
thing that I talked about in the last
vlog I've got this Mac from a table
runner from world market that I'm going
to drape over the top of the bar counter
thing in the kitchen looks like a cream
white color online and this is like
straight-up tan so I don't know I'm
going to put it over the table and see
how it looks I have this total vision
for curtains I got a little curtain
crazy I basically wanted the ceiling to
floor like drapey white curtain look so
it looks just very like airy and I'm
just going to keep the blinds up and
then just use the curtains I literally
probably spent like five hours figuring
out this current situation but what I
ended up going with we'll see how it
works out I'm going to hold off on
putting these up until my dad gets here
in a few days but I got to sheer curtain
panels these ones are just from Amazon
they're pure white and I thought I think
was that I'm going to alternate these
with these they're going to go with
super-expensive Anthropologie curtains
because they had pom-poms on them trying
to find curtains with pom-poms on them
second find ones that were what I was
looking for were anthropology and they
were so ridiculously expensive or this
place which I actually got a good deal
on it's from country currents I'll take
these out so you guys can see they have
little pom-poms on the end so this is
what they look like on the bottom so I
think I'm going to alternate these with
like the sheer ones and then to hang
them
I have literally about an inch and a
half of space between the top of the
window seal and the ceiling so I
couldn't do like a full-on curtain rod
kind of thing so I got this curtain wire
set also happy that IKEA I believe I got
this off of Amazon and I got two of
these because my I'd like an angled
window kind of things I'm gonna have my
dad set this thing up and then I got
little gold clips to close the actual
curtains on the wire hanger 20 pop this
new duvet cover and sham into the washer
I think I'm also going to surround I do
tells that I got from Target they're
white stuff smells so good go to sleep a
couple hours later I just finished
putting the video up and everything is
now clean except the duvet cover I'm
still washing it these gray sheets I got
off of Amazon I'll look through my
orders and try and find them because
these are honestly the softest best
sheets ever and they're super affordable
taking a quick to pull a break I'm
freaking starving I just post my stit
and got a burrito I never get burritos
from Chipotle I usually get Kristi I
usually get bold but I'm Anna Breda mood
got some class we Lacroix not into this
coconut flavor this is the first time I
tried to coconut I usually get lime this
is the world's best hot sauce amazing
why are your Bay covers always such a
friggin beast I put one of the shams on
I need to get a second huge puffy pillow
like this one because I don't have
another pillow I don't think I want to
put this graceful on
maker one just keep it I think I'm
actually going to get rid of the black
stripe u12 and just get a few more white
and like cream pillows super comfy
smells so good some of the new detergent
things so I just put down this rug and I
have no idea how I feel about it it's
huge like I didn't order this size and
it almost like closes off the face full
of it because you can see how far it
goes like it goes to the dining room
table and there's only a couple two feet
between the rug and the bed now I almost
think it makes it look smaller
I like the actual rug rug from Target by
the way I think I'm going to have to
return it though and get a smaller size
yeah it's pretty freakin huge so I
decided I'm going to be returning the
rug because it's just way too big for
this space but I got a little bit of
progress done over here I don't know if
I'm going to be keeping that plant here
but I feel like it looks kind of cute
and wants the curtains are up and
everything it'll look even better I
think I'm selling this plan I'm going to
get real plants but I want to show you
guys in here so I guess you're getting
kind of like a sneak peek I'm not
actually going to do a full when I turn
you around so I decide this one's there
I have so much stuff in here I'm not
going to do like an empty tour I'm just
going to do a full tour once it's
totally done but I'll show you guys
sneak peeks of like the rooms in the
space in the vlogs so this room what
you're looking at right now is solely
for work filming YouTube I'm so excited
that this space is huge and which is
perfect because filming takes a blotter
room I have so much makeup that's not
organized at all and then there's like a
walk-in closet in here which is amazing
holy sees its giant and that's like
the closet thing that my dad's going to
install so for now I just have all my
clothes in the bag so as you guys know
in the old place I had those for my
makeup storage and then I basically had
boxes and boxes of makeup everywhere
with nowhere to put it I got some of
those acrylic drawers from the Container
Store but I just didn't have anywhere to
put them so what I'm actually going to
be doing is I think I'm going to be
taking all the makeup out of these I
might put those thinner ones in the
closet but I think I'm going to sell
those too I don't know we'll see
depending on how it all works out as I
was unpacking it just was like randomly
unpacking the acrylic drawers and
putting them on this utility rack which
I had in the office space and I realized
that these actually fit
perfectly I don't know if you guys can
see but three of the small ones stacked
on top of each other
fit perfectly on these shelves so you
can actually fit 12 of these containers
just on one shelf and then the bigger
size containers you can stack two on top
of each other and fit six on one shelf
you guys thought desi Perkins make a
collection I was going to get the
entertainment center from Ikea and do a
similar thing to that but these shelves
are 50 bucks and the acrylic containers
are not cheap when you buy a ton of them
so I think what I'm going to do is just
get two more of these utility racks and
get a ton of the acrylic containers
and that's what's going to be across
this great wall so it'll be one two
three of those none of the white things
all the acrylic drawers and makeup and
this thing I got out Lowe's and I think
I'm just going to get I don't even know
eight more of those seven more of those
and that's what I'm going to hold all my
products I need to try out hair products
skin care stuff all that I think that
would be good and then I'm going to just
use a label maker to label all these the
makeup organizations going to take me
forever because it's not organized at
all right now but I unpacked like three
boxes in here so that's good and then
the bathroom I need to work on in the
bathroom I have two huge boxes in here
and there's a third outsides it's also
bathroom stuff so that's what I was
talking about like this stuff is going
to go in the brown container but some of
it is also going to go down below in the
actual bathroom thing just made a little
late-night green smoothie it's almost 10
o'clock right now and I'm getting some
editing done this video will be up by
time you guys are saying this as opposed
to mates buys my makeup video I really
hope you guys like it I'm having fun
editing this one
right so I just looked up I'm going to
tell you guys how the bed was a minute
but I need some caffeine in my body
first I'm just drinking a bang because
I'm just going to throw my hair up in a
ponytail I need to go to loads because I
realized I can't unpack all this
bathroom stuff until I get containers
for those utility racks so that's what's
happening what time is it it's like 8:30
I think it's July 3rd into a party
tonight have a shit-ton to do today to
get two videos edited and a bunch of
stuff unpacked gets tomorrow it's 4th of
July and then on the fifth I start my
new work project thing so I'm going to
be swamped I'm trying to get ahead there
technically I was supposed to film today
which is not happening sidonians have
anywhere I could set up my lights right
now this everywhere I've been
living in these well you guys can see
helping playing yoga pants and
Victoria's Secret t-shirts for the last
like two weeks I haven't unpacked my
closet because I'm kind of waiting to
give my mom that task when she comes she
wanted to help with the makeup and I was
like there's no way I'm going to have to
explain to you what each thing is weird
it is that last night I actually felt
hand and I haven't self tanned in a long
time I think last time I did was Mexico
like last year I think I was just kind
of feeling it for the fourth of July and
I wanted to try out this set first times
Lovington de les amis bronzed blocks
bronzing mousse just kidding this it's a
medium shade and holy I've never in
my life had a self-tanner that is
actually the right shade where it
doesn't look like I have I mean it's
hard to see this lighting I'll show you
is enough lighting but it just gives me
a tiny bit of color it doesn't look like
I just got back from like Cabo for five
weeks in a ponytail it because we're
just going to load folks I might go to
Jack in the Box to get an iced mocha
because they're so long there's a
jack-in-the-box right by Loes oh yeah
one piece of hair friggin pole when you
see his glasses I got at Dollar Tree and
I love them I think I'm going to go get
some more of these got a little like
really cute diamond do you look in kind
of wonder dollar she has the best black
is that the tan looks like natural
lighting as you can see it's
supernatural
didn't streak anywhere my legs are
definitely a little bit more tan the
stomach and legs are a little bit more
tan than my arms and chest I think it
put a little bit less on my chest and
stuff I like it that's a nice little bit
of color and I just use the covergirl
vitalists unnie she didn't have to mix
it in so I slept really good last night
I don't think I woke up one until the
morning the one that I chose is a bit
more firm than I'm used to I've also
been sleeping on the couch from last
like four days so that's probably why -
so I'm super happy with that it showed
my parents on FaceTime last night and it
looks like a bet I like it because it's
high enough and it doesn't look like my
bed is completely on the floor actually
looks like this time is like a little
frame under there to give it some height
glows editing unpacking bathroom my
friends coming over to drink wine here
on the roof I like six so I'll be fun
and then we're going to head over
together into this other party so it
should be a fun day
jealous and never update you guys on the
bar stool situation so unfortunately I'm
going to have to sell these guys even
though I'm so in love with them if you
missed the other vlog I was going to
reupholster these with like a brown
leather I'm still going to do it and
I'll just resell them because I love
these and I want someone to have them in
their home I think they're awesome but
as you can see the arm does not fit
under here so when it's on both sides
they just stick out way too far like I
literally lose like five feet of room
send it up ordering some online last
night from overstock they're cute just
like armless brown leather they slide
under pillows it's actually going to
Chile right now so I put on the Chuck
here we go let's get some containers
scuse my name is better for you okay can
I get it tall a Tokyo with a tiny bit of
cream whipped cream
yes all right then I'll do a bagel
toasted with cream cheese please excuse
me I'll see you tonight
that's it 495 thank you thank you okay
and then what's going on I just sliced
off this best it's like still chilling
there we're stopped coming from
Starbucks trip before loads I usually
get two shots of espresso over ice with
two pumps of white mocha but I'm not
really feeling the sugar right now so
just got a tiny bit cream I've never
actually gotten that before how did it
start bus video for the first time like
a week ago in the airport and they're
actually really bomb
this isn't like it at Lowe's I got these
two bulbs for these two pendants so then
we'd be hanging above the dining table a
caramel refresh showed you guys these
are not and then I got this giant Edison
bulb back here there's a plug behind the
bed so I got an extension cord I'm going
to run it along the bottom and then go
up the wall it's a white cord and then
like hang it down over the nightstand
thing I actually just sold these two on
offer up one guy bought both of them so
I'm going to go deliver it to him since
he doesn't have a car and then work on
unpacking the bathroom stuff here are
the five boxes that I just got that are
going to go on the bottom of the utility
shelf where you have one so it'll be six
total
by the way squatty potty that reads
about me for my birthday
so I just dropped and completely broke
my blog camera I called them and of
course they don't have the accidental
damage plan I just have the like
manufacturer's plans and be like a
couple weeks till it gets repaired so
great I don't even know if they got that
clip actually but it was sitting on my
kitchen counter and literally just fell
off the tripod anyways I wanted to show
you guys 4th of July got some stuff for
tonight wine I love this brand for
Bloody Mary's I got just regular olives
some celery I've never had the absolute
lime vodka but we're gonna try it and
then I got real limes then this is the
mix that I'm going to use so I'm excited
don't be with it you guys I'm not having
good luck today literally just pick this
duster out of the box
punch it in everything and this thing
doesn't stay down it gets hot so the
supposed to stay down so I've just on
the back and get a new coaster break
into it right and left today
Wow
yeah last night was fun hook up this
morning feeling very hungover I'm
feeling better now it's ours pretty late
fourth of July today about to go grab
lunch with some friends and we're going
to head to the beach and I think we're
going to grill on my roof put this
really nice roof I actually just made a
really good progress on the bathrooms
that feels good these boxes have been
like in the way this whole time someone
show you guys for I had two more boxes
of this size and this is actually not
some stuff I realized this is all makeup
and I think like shelving and stuff so I
think I have all the bathroom stuff
unpacked which feels great so basically
what I did was put a lot of it in here
so I'll show you guys like a little
sneak peek so I actually got this under
the sink organizer so this light goes
around your piping I got off Amazon and
just give you like double space
basically but in the meantime I just
went ahead and kind of did my thing down
here it doesn't look like it's organized
but a kind of is here's like all of my
sheet masks and stuff which this little
container I think without at the
Container Store or maybe Muji this is
perfect for sheet masks these are kind
of like my super tall bottles I have
tons of shampoo and conditioner back
there a lot of hair stuff get sent in PR
so that's why I have excessive amounts
of hair products but that stuff is like
mostly stuff that I need to try and then
kind of in the front is like my most use
done I saw these drawers and I like
pretty deep you can actually stack stuff
in there without it falling on it I need
to get a little organizer for this stuff
but this is like my everyday kind of
stuff I'm going to be definitely
organizing this Marx which is like going
in there now down here is like what do
you call this you know sick pills
band-aids creams I might be moving
around this Jeff this is kind of it's
weird but here's some hair tools I
really need to get new blow dryers how
to sing forever and that's slightly
broken tends to tape on it let me know
actually good blow-dry recommendations
like ones that work really fast
I don't like super heavy ones or like
really huge one of the Sai other travel
size and then in here we have face mask
this is embarrassing and then there's
some skin care stuff in here like face
washes but for the most part these are
all face masks
then down here is like extra Cotton's
has some skin care stuff and then fast
bombs which I hadn't been able to use in
our previous place because their shower
was pretty gross the top was like
peeling at the bottom and how my dad
hang those two things when they come I
think going to put one above the toilet
and I'll probably put some of this stuff
and I like you treatment Leon their
movie and then these guys which I showed
you guys that I got from Lowe's I'm
definitely gonna have to get more of
these because I would really fill them
all up with bathroom stuff but this is
all extra hot tools from like haircolor
staff that's all hair color face tools
teeth whitening PMD random stuff and
this is like travel stuff and then dust
gifts for people which do you guys do
that like whenever I see something that
I think the more like I get it and I
just keep it until I need to give it to
them so I have stuff ready to give and
then this box is going to be stuff that
I want to do videos on so that's a
little super good to get that stuff done
