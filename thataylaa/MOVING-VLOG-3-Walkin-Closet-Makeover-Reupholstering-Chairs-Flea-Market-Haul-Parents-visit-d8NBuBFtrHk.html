all right so this is moving vlog and
number three I'm gonna have one and two
link down below if you haven't seen them
yet 9 p.m. right now I've been running
around all day got my hair done tonight
has why there's not foundation in places
but I'm picking my parents up tomorrow
morning at the airport I'm super excited
so I figured I should start out this
moving blog since they're going to be
helping me with some home things there's
a few things I want to get done tonight
before my parents get here I'm gonna
reupholster the chairs right now those
barstools I showed you guys so that I
can list them and sell them and the new
stool should be coming in like a day or
two I went to home goods today and I got
some stuff so I'll show you guys that in
a minute but let's reupholster some
chairs trying to find where I can prop
this out out of falling over so these
are my two bar stools I've paid 25 bucks
for both of these so again for like 13
bucks each them up in the first vlogs
but they have these hideous green
cushions on them so I'm going to
reupholster them so leather off of
Amazon it was $6 so this one would be
using I got a yard but this looks like
more than yards we easily just need two
extra inches surrounding the pad the
cushion so that you can fold it over and
staples in it so I have to get stapled
in we have a staple them actually I'm
going to put you guys down here a sequel
to I'm doing you want to lay your side
down summing them so we want this white
stuff up so that when I flip over the
cushion it'll be the right way up by the
way I've never done this before I'm some
research so we'll see how this turns out
I've already unscrewed the cushions from
the stool you can see where they
reupholster this if you want here you
can undo all these staples and take the
fabric completely off but I'm not trying
to do that I'm just going to put the new
fabric directly over it which is fine
you probably won't want to do that if
you have like three layers of fabric on
there but there's just one I mean it
should be fine it's going to give myself
a little bit of extra space on this one
since this is the first one I'm doing
look at that tripod is amazon fabric
I'll have link down below it's like 25
dollars cheaper than you can get at
Joanne's since I have a not totally
square shaped tool and have to do some
work on the edges that are round I'm not
going to do like exact measurements but
I'm basically just going to fold this up
and see where I want that fabric to
cover you marks around here
I know exactly where to trim it down
Friday night right now what I do on the
Friday night welcome to my life very
thrilling I do I have a hole how I pay
my furniture without standing video that
I think still to this day is my most
popular video ever made whoo look at
that okay I'm going to start with the
sides and do like a four corners kind of
thing I think make sure the fabric is
like smooth under here it was going to
look good gonna pull it really tight
love staple gun so much go on the corner
I'm doing like a low fold over so it's
not a big fold and you actually can't
see it at all on the top I need to make
smaller size staple guns like this
article okay let's see how it looks oh
yeah look at that
I ran out of staples almost have a
sample substrate and then I opened one
cardboard box of pack stuff and
magically found them meant to be so I
finish this cushion I think it looks
really nice so here's before and here's
after this fake leather actually looks
really nice they both done does me about
well like choking on my own air 45
minutes I think looking good I wiped
them down a little bit so the bottoms
are all clean and shiny now I guess that
I went to home goods today so I'm going
to show you guys the click little
haulage got a few things can members I
mentioned but I wanted to get new
pillows for the bed I think I'm going to
get rid of the black one because I don't
kind of just want them all to be like
white and creams got this pillow which I
love with the tassels and this one was
like super computing
this one I actually got on clearance and
I wanted to mix it between white white
like true white and creams 14 bucks hell
yeah that's really good for a pillow
those can get forgetten pricey don't
know why they're just fabric like an
off-white with kind of tan lacing so I
thought that would look good I want to
put all this on and seconds - guys can
see got this really cute little tee
thing with the rose gold handle actually
have a bunch of loose tea leaf things
over here on the bar cards and stuff
that miler and I got in Portland from
like an herbal kind of shop that's not
focusing but spensive like
anti-inflammation tea I want to try got
some just bad clips and a little thing
to hold your sponge and the sink so this
rug as soon as I saw I've been kind of
looking for rugs like this on off rep
but this one once I saw the colors I was
sold the tones and the yellow in here
will look good with the couch it's not a
like full area rug it's just a little
uneven Oh sighs this is probably four by
six you guys kind of what it looks like
it has a little green tassel I'm going
to find a spot for this because I just
think the colors and everything look
really good in here once everything
comes together but this was super
affordable this looks 16.99 which is
like hella cheap for rugs I got these
two cutting boards and these ones are
pretty reasonable actually like smaller
cutting boards better than big ones
because I don't know they're just like
light and easy to use just to cut
vegetables and stuff this I thought was
super pretty I'm going to put this over
here I think this was like a total last
minute checkout line kind of purchase
but I love the color of this I really
like matching sets of mugs I just like
to get different ones so it's like fun
you can pick them out and then the last
thing I got is just this giant gray and
white striped storage bin thing which I
got I think either for the laundry
closet or the top of my clothes closet
one was actually in the kids section and
like little boy section so that's
everything I got at HomeGoods day all
right so it is the next morning I'm
about to go to Lowe's actually oh that's
a good one
I'm about to go to Lowe's because they
placed a huge online order for more
storage bin things that I have to pick
up at this one location kind of by the
airport so I woke up super early so I
can go pick those up before I pick my
parents up it's like 7:45 right now here
is my outfit of the day I just got this
shirt from cotton I'm I freaking love
cotton on I feel like it's totally
underaged at least in the u.s. it's
super cheap and they have tons of cute
stuff I got it in white and black and I
think it was like 10 bucks
then these jeggings I'm obsessed with
these are from American Eagle
if I can find these I'll link them down
below long t-shirt so I think we're from
Target I want to say a while ago repeat
my parents up I think we're going to go
to a little
market thing and then we're going to get
started on working on this place because
if those new pillows look like on the
bed I think that tassel one is like
perfect because it ties it in with that
so I think I'm going to keep them all
and just donate the black and white one
that I had on there before I also got
this out of pots and pans off of Amazon
is one that pretty good reviews you just
get eight pieces so I don't know I mean
I don't do a whole lot of cookin but I
probably should this is the rubbermaid
configurations thing i just got this on
amazon i think it was like 100 bucks
around there I'll link it down below
basically this walk-in closet is forget
a huge so we're going to try em on and
add some shelving and stuff in here just
to make it more organized and use all
the space because there's the ship done
here we go see if we can figure this out
here's my girl I love her I'm getting a
wide angle okay here's a before of the
closet space how big do you think this
is does that mean by seven we're seven
and a half five we're going to need to
measure because we were planning on
doing the eight slit version 72 is six
foot five inches so you got to do it 6
foot wall use okay so now let's look at
the back and see which one we want again
I wanted the longer bar so we're trying
to find the studs it you faculty so
we're using Molly bolts instead of this
stuff fender yes
okay that's supposed to secure the show
we don't know really what we're doing we
pretend to the wing it shall not jeweled
up his ride mom is now the youtube
director shown
neither what way to eat you can say
something here this is the video
director so what we just did was put
there's two inch ends right here then
you run these four what are this called
dad for a goal
she a bracket graphic vertical upright
so basically that's where you can hang
and like customize where you want things
to you are the little storage things
that I'm actually going to be putting on
the utility shelf long story short lows
didn't have enough of the brown ones so
I'm putting the brown ones in my closet
and I think the laundry closet and then
these are going to be the ones on the
utility rack with these foods are just
link or any leather version so I
actually think will be nicer with a gray
wall transferring all the stuff that I
already putting these brown ones into
the gray ones for the utility rack and
then from the flea market thing today I
got this super-cute pillow kind of
getting this thing for 20 bucks then I
got this for 7 and I think what I'm
going to do is like put this kind of by
the couch and have like a cute little
plant stand thing so it's like kind of a
mini chair I just love the gold looks
cool
oh wow that is nice that you wanted you
might want to show this how these things
clamp Ian kind of cool no radicals you
can just move them wherever yes okay so
I think the closet is done this looks
awesome so we can always move around the
shelves if we're like hanging things
that needs to be different or make them
you know some smaller and some bigger I
might get a different shoe rack to put
along this wall now we're installing a
couple shelves these are just leftovers
from the closet system all the stuff
from the brown boxes and these actually
worked out better because these ones are
bigger too this is all make up for
giveaways extra from PR stuff for
friends and family to go through then
I'm also going to make a donate box and
I have these ones too it'll be going on
utility shed then they were just doing
that for each item we had a rollin
Taylor on my right your left mine food
and professional carry cuz of that one
for all these boards and I've logged it
all today it
mom is still working on the closet this
actually looks totally different I'll
show you guys at the end afterwards my
dad built those two racks and then this
third one's going to be moved over as a
very horrible blogger today 10,000 pairs
if I picked them up at 9 a.m. and from 9
to 7 pretty much we were like full-on
hardcore unpacking but we got so much
done today and so thankful that my
parents are able to help me out with
this because literally you guys the
amount of organizing and unpacking and
all the makeup and everything that I
have is it would have taken me at least
three weeks down pack and we took me
three weeks to pack everything up like
between working and everything don't
like that we like cranked out a ton
today like we got a ton done I don't
even remember the last stuff I showed
you guys but we went to Ross and Home
Depot too so I got a couple things I
found I got a bath rug I'm going to
throw in a towel was full time I'll show
you guys that so this is a little
bastard I got I like it because it a is
like the most comfy thing ever like
little pom-poms but it gives you a foot
like a foot massage but it almost looks
like marble I thought it'd look really
cute with the countertops which need
some organizing my dad if I'm mad shells
camera for show you that I started
organizing with jewelry but not really
we hung that guy little plan up there
this is the laundry room the English you
guys have seen little shots of but this
we got way organized I mean more than
before so my dad put together that
little cart thing we hung those two
shelves just for more space I need to
organize like cleaning stuff a little
bit more and I think I don't know if I'm
going to keep the paint stuff right
there I need to go through that pain
just get rid of a lot of it suitcases up
there all that is like towels beach
towels sheets things like that this room
is where we made major progress for
there were three huge cardboard boxes
still done packed stuff everywhere bags
of clothes these are all going to be
like moves this is not we literally just
put it against the wall we hung these
nail polish racks today which before I
had my foundation in here in the office
space I still have to put away all the
shoes we had to get a shoe rack today
because we ran out of space so my mom
was one who was like in control of the
closet she was in here for I think like
four hours today literally hanging stuff
up organizing stuff I'm going to show
you guys tomorrow I'm not going to go in
ix it's not done yet well what else did
we do look at this vlog camera and
low-light coffee cart is or cops are
what the heck is this coffee table I
still have a rug and the new barstool is
coming and that's obviously not where
it's going to be didn't show you guys
actually everything I got since we
market actually forgot these shot
glasses they need to be washed but how
friggin cool are these they have little
glass cactus in them this is so cool and
also at the flea market I got this
little thing which needs to be somehow
cleaned I don't think I can wash this
but I'm going to figure out how to clean
this and I mean they're going to put
this on the coffee table or hang it on
the wall above the coffee cart even like
lay this on the top of the coffee cart
and then put stuff on top of it if you
like the decor looks kind of all over
the place right now but I have a vision
so let's come together I hope don't
remember if I told you guys my brain is
non functioning right now it's 10:00
p.m. and I still have to work clothes of
things
wow this is a great blog oh I can't

Vayner store I had to order all the
acrylic organizers because they didn't
