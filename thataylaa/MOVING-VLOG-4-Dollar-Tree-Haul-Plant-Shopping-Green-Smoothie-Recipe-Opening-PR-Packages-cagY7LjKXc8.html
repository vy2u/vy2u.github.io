hmm whoa too early to be talking right
now all right so we are starting off
moving blog number three I need to go
get start by someone to get a bagel and
some coffee I'm about to go pick up Rach
we're going to go to the Container Store
to finally pick up the make up storage
so I can organize all those and then
also get plants at Lowe's or Home Depot
whatever has a better selection
hopefully I can start working on the
make up room today after we get those
things I do need to film later today too
we're going camping tomorrow I have two
videos pre films I think I need a third
one film later today at it and then also
last night my curtains fell down my
curtains up my dad and I put up actually
fell down yesterday when I was trying to
put down the blinds so the cable system
is totally fine is just the connector
piece the connector piece connecting the
two wires actually broke so I ordered a
different one on Amazon a longer one so
I'm going to have to attempt to put that
together but other than the curtains
dying it's really just a makeup room
that has work left and then I'm going to
show you guys the full-on apartment tour
student I went to Dollar Tree yesterday
I had to pick up a couple things for a
video I'm working on but I'll show you
guys a little haul because I got a
couple home stuff too what is going on
with my voice right now let's be a bike
in and not drop the blonde camera off
the table of the Sun oh by the way got
the new barstools you guys will see it
before but they're just like brown yes
there's only a couple things that I'm
going to show you how to addresses for
that video they got two more of my
coca-cola cuts I always get questions
about these I get them at Dollar Tree
they've had them in stock for years like
literally since I was in college so
longtime couple of them have been
dropped in things so I just picked up a
couple more I actually really wanted the
diamond one so they keep talking about
actually has a memory I got these at
Dollar Tree few months ago but they
didn't have any in stock at all so I'm
going to keep looking for these guys I
got this Glade clean limit clean why can
I do that work clean linen smells really
good - smells like laundry I know these
will actually work I'll have to see how
they stick and stuff these are for the
bottom of furniture so they don't like
rub on the floors these wood floors
they're not real wood they're like lamb
another thing but whatever they are they
scratched super easily so I got these
for the bottom of the barstools okay I
thought this was really cute whenever we
go to the beach and bring the hookah
bring a lighter I hate the clicky
lighter so this is like a mini little
probably didn't eat those but and then
these are my favorite things that I got
I got two of these glasses with a little
cactus bottom these are going to look
really cute on the bar card let's go to
Starbucks and The Container Store
I freaking love 16 ER store like my
happy place let's go see the Pacifica
was our cute dude I found out Lily after
water is like once a week everyone and
when every day if you you guys on
Instagram told me that you'd be a indoor
plant and I'm looking for a fiddle big I
can only got one to cheer on money to me
I like that one
yeah that's me look at these are things
I really hate I think that one might
look good in the crochet the
math-amazing even you got that one needs
some deep conditioner so we left some v
book they didn't have political stakes
of Siddeley simply our in the Bellevue
nursery and there's so many play I'll
slim have the tiny ones of little plants
camping bizarre now we're trying to find
a bigger one for the corner
none these ones we get a sudden really
easy to take care of but I've got a fake
one of those already a target good that
one oh well cool I feel like the glossy
ones almost like fake like that face
that 100mm of states that actually
looking classic look at your best
minecraft off this sounds like kind of
water work hopeful how does the water
not get in my house you need all of
those bases plan is the things are so
few really and very drawn to that both
of their lives it over here in turn
postures people look at will be where
you can actually return your place I
think you can come over here so let's
stick plant bear that's me
oh those look cute like it you know this
would need a lot of lighter now I write
our does
they have little cacti oh my god only
fishes
like the child Mary Mary
Thanks
whoo-hoo
Yeah right okay guys here's the plants
that I got so both of these are hi kiss
that is like a fig leaf Italy if you
want to exactly I think it's fiddly so
this cold ficus Decorah burgundy bush so
these are going to be going in these
pots I got both of these at cb2 these
would look really cute on the little
stand thing and then I'm going to have a
succulent right there I think I'm kind
of having buyer's remorse because I just
found out that I actually have two deep
pot these like I need soil and gravel
and used to fake plants this is
this is a lot I can do this it's just a
plant
I also don't want to do this in my house
I don't know how I'm going to actually
reap off these I guess if you keep them
in that plastic thing and just put the
plastic thing in the pot the roots will
get rotted because the water doesn't
have anywhere to air out or something
like that
your other acrylic drawers there's
literally four more of these so I can
put away the makeup now or start
organizing it
I don't know why the camera is picking
up even the worst uh notice but I put
self tanner on tonight which is why I
look lightly wild I was just laying in
bed and did like a double take on the
date and completely thought I had an
entire week between Elly for camping
tomorrow going through the weekend and
then I leave on San Francisco the day I
get back for the next morning after I
get back from camping I go straight from
San Francisco to Tahoe and I'm going to
be gone for ten days like I literally
don't get back into Seattle until the
26th right now when I'm filming this at
13 I had no idea I thought I was having
an entire week between camping in San
Francisco to work so now I am kind of
freaking out it was supposed to be a two
night camping trip I'm going to now head
back a night early so that I can have
all day Sunday to work before I leave
Monday I'm going to try my best to get
my normal three videos a week up when I
wake up at six tomorrow before really
for camping try and film two videos kind
of stressing I'm like thinking if I
should shorten any of the trip somehow
but they're all booked kind of debating
not going camping all together sleeping
tonight is going to be fun I was
literally just full-on about 12-8 salmon
okay alright so it's been a hell the
last like 12 hours but woke up at 6 a.m.
to film 2 videos before camping was all
packed was getting ready to go and that
is cancel camping instead this is my job
and at the end of the day just felt
weird to take basically a ten-day
vacation without having six videos up
like my normal 30 weeks so I decided to
cancel camping so that tomorrow Saturday
and Sunday I can film and get for more
videos done and I'll just have to work
on editing them when I'm gone which is
fine friends I was going to go camping
with or actually still going tomorrow
but they're going to stay here tonight
so we can do a bonfire thing so that'll
be fun so at least we'll still get to
like do some kind of camping kinds of
things so that was really nice of them
so yeah just one up to you guys right
now I'm wearing this estee lauder
maximum cover which normally is like ten
shades dark for me but it matches
perfectly right now and I'm feeling it
put Smashbox primer water on underneath
it and for foundations that are like
super matte like the Marc Jacobs
remarkable
I like to use a primer water underneath
and it totally makes it look more like
skin like this glow on my forehead would
not be happening without the primer
water okay I wanted to show you guys
this because I got foundation on the
pillow all over here and right here
so check the pillowcase off and i
YouTubed had to do this and they say to
actually use shaving cream and as I'm
rubbing this it's legitimately
completely coming out like I can see it
coming out so I'm going to try on this
one you guys will see here's the before
I'm just using gillette that you can use
anything i use the shaving cream and i
just popped it in the washer and it's
still like damp right now
but it literally took out everything so
if you ever have to get stains
foundation stains or anything out of
white definitely try shaving cream
because that worked amazing you do
actually like rub it in and then let it
sit for a couple minutes but yeah that
literally took out everything I always
get questions on snapchat when I showed
green smoothies about what I put in so I
figured I would show you guys I use the
Magic Bullet super easy because all you
do is put the stuff in here put the lid
on and then turn it over and get on
Amazon I learned it down below I always
put in a banana because I feel like it
cuts out a lot of the taste of the green
stuff I put in if I have a fresh banana
it's about to go bad I'll use it I
usually use frozen bananas I just peel
them and stigman a bag and put it in the
freezer I love frozen mango and it gets
to me a second just like two or three
frozen strawberries okay maybe four but
this is like the secret ingredient and
put in any kind of coconut cream err
just makes it taste really good and like
creamy it just changes the consistency
if I'm feeling more like a watery one
more like a juice I won't use this I
literally just put like that mention
about the stuff of Amazon and this is
like a green powder kind of thing it has
20 organic ingredients spirulina it does
have a little bit of a funky taste to it
which is why I would use something like
a banana that has like a stronger taste
to kind of cut it out if you just click
finish it you definitely can't taste
this finish at all you literally can't
tell there's finish in there if you put
this in you can taste it a little bit it
doesn't bother me I kind of like tasting
it one scoop of that in I like to also
add fresh spinach because
face it though I not accepted a lot in I
just put like handful and then kind of
push it all down there you definitely
need some kind of liquid so I usually
just put in cold water
sometimes when I blend that they'll have
to stop at halfway and like add some
more water in there keep in mind that
this thing goes down in there so you
won't want to fill it all the way to the
top post or your get some village so
that's what it looks like when all the
stuff is in there now we're going to
actually blend make sure the cap is
super tight so doesn't I go and you just
if it seems kind of thick like this I'll
usually add some more water so here's
the consistency the flake perfect for
what I like and then get a little straw
whoops
looking at the viewfinder there we go
you literally can't even taste this just
tastes like a really good strawberry
banana smoothie I got this next thing
off of Amazon which is great if you have
neck issues it's like a massager thing
but it's frickin intense like if I just
leave it here just rips my muscles my
necks been bad I'm trying to film all
morning it's now 12:00 got up at 7:30 we
really need to film a foundation Friday
video today it's always hard to start
those after like 11:00 because I try and
keep them on for at least nine hours I
think I'm just going to attempt to film
right now and trying to wrap up this
other video
okay so the next morning I woke up early
to film a foundation Friday today
yesterday I felt pretty shitty all day
my pill started kicking in around 4:00
p.m. so from 4:00 p.m. on I was actually
really productive to all my sheets
started packing for my trip since I
leave tomorrow morning edited to videos
scheduled one cleaned up a little bit I
got finally all the bathroom stuff that
away I'll show you guys well I just kind
of push it everywhere again put a friend
and there's my straightener but anyways
got all the stuff that was on the
counter put away got the jewelry all set
up finally and then I cleaned up my film
area a little bit I just filmed so much
again still need to organize all these I
don't see this happening before trip so
it's probably going to be it'll be the
end of July until I get this done I'm
gonna get my nails done
fingers and toes before I leave for the
trip so I think I'm going to go do that
before it gets super packed it's 9:30
right now I actually don't think they
open till like 10:00 or 11:00 on Sundays
oh I got a bunch of my hair back edges
from my old apartment my roommate
brought them over as such an experience
on see our unboxing so the most part I
just think they're kind of annoying but
I know a lot of people like them
whenever I show snippets of stuff on
snapchat you guys want to see more of it
and I feel like everyone gets the same
PR so you guys see it 50 times I might
snap and see if you guys want to see it
in this log but I have a whole pile of
stuff making avocado toast some bacon
and watching Lauren XR so see her vlogs
I just got my nails done going back and
forth between acrylic with black shellac
over top or just like this natural kind
of pink which I obviously went with this
so this is just pink powdered acrylic
and then we put this like light pink CND
kind of top coat over it this is where I
cut my finger the other day and it came
open again gays you wanted to see that
they're really natural-looking there's
got a pedicure and got right on my toes
if you the Trader Joe's gluten free
bread and then avocado I use my blue cow
cheese it's a little bit of salt on it
jam and also put onion and I think some
tomato because I have tomatoes that are
going to go bad here we go I think I'm
ready for Top Chef
we can ride it long time to lug this is
now ten days later I went to Tahoe and
Francisco which were amazing I didn't
vlog so just wanted kind of a break out
snapchatting and Instagram storing the
whole time though so here's my ex I wish
I thanked beside here's my handle Sybil
handles but I got back yesterday and
then I woke up this morning at 5:00 a.m.
with a horrible migraine started
vomiting was vomiting from 5:00 a.m.
it's now 4:00 p.m. and I get a bad one
I'm like on the bathroom floor I mean
here you go this is where I camped out
but when I get a bad one I'm like
vomiting every 20 minutes for hours I
was about to go to the ER because I'm
vomiting nothing stays down like none of
the triptans or painkillers or anything
the nausea pills like nothing nothing
stays down so the only option is usually
to go and they like hook you up to an IV
and then you get painkillers put in that
way but the whole reason I'm talking
about this usually don't even mention
when I get my grand stuff is because I
tried out this thing for the first time
tweeted about this because if you are a
fellow migraine sufferer and you kind of
have the same situation this might be
helpful for you because it definitely
works for me this is the sumatriptan
injection USPS is basically a tripped in
like imitrex a rise it trip in all those
you definitely need a prescription for
this it's a shot that you give yourself
you just like take off this cap and push
against your leg and then you like push
this button and the shop is into you
which isn't super Pleasant but honestly
when you're in that much pain it doesn't
even feel like anything compared to the
pain in the rest of your body but this
thing worked I'm not kidding it took
away like 80% of my migraine and
vomiting within an hour which is unheard
of even when I go to the ER the stuff
they put in me doesn't usually kick in
for like three hours and then you're so
groggy on meds that you're like out an
entire day so the fact that this thing
just worked and that quick and now I'm
like half a light on and functioning and
I just ate breakfast is like incredible
definitely talk to your neurologist
about this telling you guys what just
helped me but I'm just like so thankful
that I'm functioning right now so let's
just film two videos today
and it's already not like I said it's
like 4 p.m. but I'm going to attempt to
clean all this stuff up shower and then
still
moans yeah watch is amazing when you go
from being in so much pain to like
walking and functioning within like a
solarz so thank you to whoever invented
this to put on a face mask I need a
shower this is a glam glow brightening
treatment I don't think I've try this
one I can't remember I never want to
super drying one because my skin has
been pretty dry since going to Java and
stuff while I was a way I was working on
video ideas and I ordered a bunch of
stuff so I have a couple really fun
videos that I'm going to film I have the
boxes of stuff all unpacked about to
arrival are on the Indian context from
Goldstone is publicist that Paul
Manafort and Donald Trump jr. appear
before the committee
he said that they don't appear willingly
could subpoena them if necessary so mark
your calendars don't necessarily clear
your schedule ended up being able to
film the video I couldn't film - because
it's like 9 o'clock right now and the
lighting was getting weird with the Sun
going down and everything by just full
face testing Claire's makeup I already
peeled off the lashes as my eyeballs are
burnin a video will be out by time this
vlog goes up for sure but now I'm gonna
do the drawers because I really want to
get that done so I can film apartment or
I'm definitely not going to get it all
done tonight but I think I might start
and at least like label them so I know
where to put everything do you have a
label maker that I'm going to use to
label all the acrylic drawers you need
to under all those PR bosses so I can
put those away
nd I'm starting right now I'm sure I
have like 10 more hours in the day today
this is the aftermath of filming a video
they got this super cute watermelon tip
from Claire's I'm obsessed with it and
then this thing which I think I'm going
to hang and go look cute above a little
plant this 12:50 but I got it for free
because it was the buy three get three
free things I'm probably way too amused
with this but I got the label maker up
and running and then printing my labels
it's a model but I got it off of Amazon
a link below starting to stick them on
you could probably put them on this
thing but I kind of like it down here
I'm going to do a need to sort because
whenever after I film I don't usually
put away everything in this place right
away with that so quick so easy
I've been some breakfast coffee's Brewin
over here
I'm gonna show you guys the filming room
because I literally was working on it to
like 2:00 a.m. last night I got a lot
done it's like
was done pretty much to start filming
foundation Friday I have a task rabbit
coming right now
to help me fix the curtain situation
because they fell can't move I told you
guys that and I can't do it by myself I
need like a tall person and a second
pair of hands they're coming right now
he just actually think makes running a
little bit late Saturday today I have a
lot of work to do but I already filmed
and I need to go pick up packages from
my old apartment I think I'm gonna do
that I need to go grocery shopping and
it's like super sunny and like 70
degrees out already and it's only 10:00
a.m. right now I really want to get
outside if I can so task grab it just
came and we have curtains yay we're also
getting a little sneak peek right now
this corner but I have these little pom
pom ones which you guys saw in the hall
and my TaskRabbit guy was super cool I
talked for like a half-hour I didn't
realize there was an hour minimum so it
probably looks like nothing to you guys
but I made major major progress on this
last night have labels on a bunch of
stuff now I have it a lot more organized
you guys will see my like makeup
collection and all that when I do the
beauty room tour but this is all PR that
I took out of the boxes so it's easier
to go through that I need to sort not
going to make like PR and boxing's a
saying on my channel at all since I have
to put this stuff away
anyways figured let's go through it
together I don't even know where to
start or what the best way to do this is
probably not with the bottom box this
box I didn't buy you a lot of BH
Cosmetics lately because I've just had
really good luck with them recently I
feel like but they just sent like
literally everything so usually what I
do is PR is go through and I separate
things out buy things I want to try out
things I'm going to give away I say
literally probably 60 70 % of stuff gets
donated or for giveaways I have three
bins right here these are all giveaway
products so I'll be having a huge giant
giveaway coming soon as those two bins
are totally full right now but that's
basically where I have products where
whenever someone comes over or I go
visit a friend or something I'll just
bring I should send a makeup whenever
there's really good ribbons on PR
affections I cut them off because it's
gonna be used and I just go in the trash
and I can't do this one hand might as
well repurpose it this one could
actually be really nice like curtain
tied to I like that color for the living
room this is from Smashbox I've never
seen this and I love this idea I think
this is awesome they give you a prepay
mailer and then it says we believe in
giving back we're giving you the option
to donate anything in this box it's not
your style choose a charity blow and
then you just literally mail back I'm
wondering if you can mail back and he
makeup in here or just the shades the
foundation here you don't want but I
love that I wish more companies did that
with PR by donation a ton of my PR
already but to have this is just super
easy and that's such a great idea I love
that there at least like bringing
awareness to that but this is their new
foundation shaping sticks foundation
they also said this one was freaking
heavy from Smashbox says primer Iser ooh
primer and moisturizer with hyaluronic
acid this is an intense box which is
like but I just pop it this is like boba
they're the new Sigma dimensional
brushes the very interesting shape it
looks like a dog chewed off part of it
curious to see how these work max sent
this next to nothing selection looks
like I think this is a foundation well
slide that way that's Nicole
holy C's face color it says and
then there's next to mething pressed
powder in here definitely going to try
out that powder always really crazy to
me when I open Mac PR because I used to
work for them freelance so just kind of
like crazy full circle so Thank You Mac
I feel like I should keep this case
because it's like a really nice acrylic
slide case ooh you know what this could
be perfect for sunglasses yeah hell yeah
glam glow kind of has like no rhyme or
reason to their PR like they just keep
sending face masks which I'm not
complaining about very grateful for but
I have to have most of them at this
point so these usually just go straight
into the giveaway box
so both these will be in a giveaway for
you guys I sent two of the overnight
transforming treatment dream duo's from
hourglass let's see what's in here
ooh look at this leather ultra slim
high-intensity refillable lipstick
that's interesting refillable lipstick
how does this work
this somehow is the applicator am I just
having a blonde moment right now
probably instruction somewhere this oh
that while not up this what four years
of college gets yes okay interesting
interesting concept
you have a spring in suitcase look at
this water model matte black water
bottle hell yeah on a mission for a new
nighttime moisturizer samus I try this
is the ultimate hydro gel and there's
also a hydro sleep mask here and then
what is this hydro soothe a gel
maybelline send this thing on the
outside the package it says something
about national lipstick Day July 25
Maybelline lipsticks in here Thank You
Maybelline man Maybelline always has the
best soft boxes are so soft this one is
from origin and I just say I freaking
love when people write handwritten notes
and look at this girl's handwriting that
is beautiful
ginseng Energizer's oh my god this is
adorable
so bean box they're based in Seattle so
get another moisturize this is a tinted
moisturizer with SPF 40 brightening
mascara don't know why you want your
mascara to be brightening energy
boosting gel moisturizer definitely
going to try this out looks like this is
from butter LONDON there's a ton of
confetti in here accidentally exploded
in here whoo these are pretty another
packaging to like some nice metallic
shades I'm not a vacuum because there's
confetti going everywhere I did a little
bit of online shopping on finish line
I've got this Nike hat this is so
friggin cute black and white polka dot
adidas top I think I got the sin that
yeah got this in a medium because they
like these tops to be more baggy
backpack which I do not need but the
reason why I got this is because it's
like one of the drawstring backpacks
kind of but it actually has adjustable
straps and the drawstring backpacks
always sit way too low on me since I'm
short so I like to put this head
adjustable strap so hopefully it'll sit
at the right point and actually has a
really nice like sturdy base to it so I
feel like this would actually be good
for carrying like a laptop and stuff in
and I got these shoes for Nike and
Adidas I usually get kids
Nike I can fit in there sighs sighs but
adidas I can't they usually run a little
bit big so I usually just get kids these
are kids size threes and usually save a
 ton of money if you can fit in a
kid shoes these were $54.99 like these
would have been at least 100 if it was
the normal women's adidas these are so
freakin cute okay a few other packages
just came in the mail and I'll show you
guys but I just found fellas
YouTube channel or YouTube a wireless
pellet and print autofocus touching the
friggin iPhone right now what am i doing
so she's a flight attendant and I just
found her vlogs and she's hilarious I'm
gonna link her channel down below you
guys have to go watch her it just seems
like such a fun person but just
subscribed her it's fly with Stella and
she's actually in Seattle on this
layover which is funny I got sucked into
watching her vlog so I'm just like
unboxing and I'm gonna start putting
away all the stuff this one's from
Smashbox haven't opened this yet summer
vibes ooh more they're always on liquid
