all right so it is moving blog number
five super science I think so I'm
filming today so my foundation is
looking a little funky little wild
flamingo mugs so I think this is going
to be the last moving blog before the
apartment tour because I'm almost done
I'm just doing like last-minute kind of
things which is crazy so tomorrow do
like a photo shoot kind of thing so
that'll be fun but I need to figure out
what the heck I'm going to wear I
ordered some really exciting things from
thread up I like scored so I'm going to
show you guys what are you doing oh
that's nice there
here's they're super cute box so I got
some stuff for fall but I also got a
couple dresses and things that I think
might work for tomorrow by the Volga
sponsored by thredUP so thank you to
them for collaborating with me on
another video I did a past try on the
haul with them so link that one down
below - we're going to boxing so if
you've never heard of thread up they're
basically like second-hand online
shopping they have some really nice
stuff though like they have free people
they have adidas nike like good brands
on there and the thing I think I was
most impressed by last time was that
every item I got looked like new
literally like I feel like they're super
picky with the quality because every
piece you can see that it wasn't like
faded or just like too worn down
I love thrift in so online thrifting is
like heaven for me i frickin love their
packaging clay makes me 50 times more
excited okay so I got some jackets for
fall oh my gosh I'm so excited like look
at this let's look freaking brand-new
this is Nike the fleece looks like it's
been washed like a couple times and it
looks super cute with like yoga's and
running shoes for all the running I do
so this one is a contender for tomorrow
for the photo shoot
this one is forever 21 oh this still has
tags on it I'm going to try that one on
I wanted some new jackets for fall who
that might even look cute with the dress
this is a Levi's denim jacket here's
another option for tomorrow
this is H&amp;amp;M and it's just like super
long length flowy dress and we try that
one on - okay that was really hard to
show in the box with wet hands I got
this Victoria Secret like cutout kind of
hoodie thing you guys know I love my
pink clothes at blue this is soft this
looks like it'll be come see if it falls
and I got a couple jackets but I also
want to try one oh my god when I saw
this I'm gonna shat my pants I've been
wanting to get this hoodie for like
months now
and they had it on thredUP I'm so
excited
I mean amen to that am i right okay I
can't button this one myself like all
the way open on the back but I think
buttoned this one is a winner I like so
like loose flowy sleeves and then it has
this like cutout kind of thing over here
and need to shave my legs
I'm sure if it's supposed to be quite
this long but I feel like you could
almost work like this with them like
wedges or high-heeled and I like the
neckline it's almost like boatneck whoo
I can picture this with like a dark dark
red lip or dark purple lip and like
peachy makeup I just pulled this over my
head and then realize there's a frigging
zipper down the side this one actually
fits really cute too I think usually
these ones are really hit or miss for me
because a lot of times since I'm short
this seem like falls too low on my waist
but I think this one is cute obviously
with a different bra and the detail on
the bottom of this is really pretty cool
two for two so far
so here's the Levi's jacket I don't
think I would wear it with this dress
the red tag is like kind of thrown me
off but this one says cute - I can
picture this with like black rips denim
and like a white top or something this
one actually fits perfectly like in the
arms and everything and I like how it's
dark I don't have any dark jean jackets
like this welcome to my life this is my
issue with every jacket that's like
supposed to be long it's just way too
long so I have to get this one hemmed
I'm pretty sure but I wanted a coat like
this that I could wear in the winter
that's super warm that I could wear with
dresses and like nicer things because I
usually just wear my North Face and it
looks really bizarre this one is by Ann
Taylor really nice quality it has a
knitted thing up here which I really
like I think it actually fits good
everywhere except the link I think I got
it like an inch below where this dress
is falling that would look better
because right now it's like totally
covering my knees there's pockets oh
hell yeah this is warm I'm fitting right
now in this thing this is the final
jacket that I got this one is from gap
in it society small petite it's like
this moto kind of one and this is cute
like a dark blue wool it's like nice and
fitted that I love how they have the
little thread up ties on here it says
renewed with love in San Francisco you
guys have never been on the app is super
easy you can like preset everything you
can search specifically by brands and
stuff but I kind of just like to type it
in search so like you can see my search
is Tobey
my search started that was a brain part
like Tobey dresses they have on here and
if you go under filter you can preset
your sizes so I just have my sizes saved
which is super nice just makes it really
easy so you can see the original prices
on how much I got them for it forever 21
dress which still has the tags on it was
$29 and I got it for $12.99
holy crap Diane Taylor Loft jacket it
was normally 188 and I got it for $42.99
super good deals so I'm super excited
about everything I got I think I might
save this dress I think I'm going to
wear that flower one for tomorrow is
Kristi I like both of these let me know
which one you guys think I should wear
down below this video will be up at a
time we do the photoshoot
I just realized so if you guys want to
check out the write-up I'll have a link
down below where you can get 40% off
your first order up to $50 off it is no
joke 90 degrees in my apartment right
now so I think I'm going to go find
somewhere to work in a/c so I'm not just
sitting here in like a sauna and have
been very into string cheese lately do
you guys bite or pull apart your string
cheese I'm a fighter so then I'm going
to make another green smoothie I showed
you guys my recipes I guess you'd call
it in the last movie blog can I make my
green smoothie so I'm going to do that
and then I'm going to go work got all
the goods I'm not going to lie that one
not my greatest green smoothie
achievement ended up having to split it
into two cups because I put way too much
frozen stuff in it and it wouldn't blend
but it ended up working sugar everywhere
got pretty wild I'm sipping a salmon
burger siwash and some fried healthy
watching Lauren slugs like I've watched
her vlogs every vlog that I vlog it's
been obsessive mixing ketchup with
sriracha so get in mixing them so it's
later in the night and I actually just
posted moving blog number for a while
ago and I was just reading comments for
like last half-hour and responding to
some of them and I just want to say a
huge thank you to you guys you guys
don't know how much I appreciate every
single one some of the stuff that you
guys write are certain videos where I
especially feel a tension I know
getting to talk to you guys when I see
you on snapchat and just reading your
comments and stuff and recognizing your
photos you do feel like you get to
connect Zoe I always see you comment Zoe
thank you she left a comment saying that
she feels like she gets to learn more
about me through these videos which I
guess I don't ever realize because I
feel like I show you guys things on
snapchat but sometimes you're just like
in the zone and like living your life
and I guess blogs and shadow and
schmooze are really the only times you
guys get to actually like see me not
behind like make up videos and stuff
which I don't really realize I guess
those things you can follow me on
snapchat and get to see a lot more I
think I just assumed that you guys know
or like see more than you do actually do
if that makes any sense whatsoever thank
you hey mom hey what's up wait so okay
talk to you soon
okay okay that looks like it my fault I
just went through Starbucks right there
I just got salt ice doppio with a tiny
bit of cream I usually get it with two
pumps of white mocha what is little bit
shirts I've been on the plane bagel from
Starbucks like lately I'm like addicted
to them they're all out of it so it's
not sprouted wheat budget sounds part
this guy's looking at Megan Brady
I feel part of the apartment tour video
I wanted to get the main rooms done
while they're super clean like I cleaned
my whole apartment yesterday I'm working
on the hallway that's what I'm doing
today I'm going to go try and find some
stuff so I can film the rest of the
apartment tour I'm actually going to go
to this Ballard consignment store which
I've never been to it was really huge I
think it's pretty pricey whoo
strong one I think it's like kind of a
more pricey antique kind of store which
I'm not that into because you like more
like restores the girl forgotten I for
the cream cheese whoops
but my goal today is to find a wood
floor huge mirror for that always space
Nomad ethically have that silver mirror
that was from the old apartment which I
don't mind but I want to do a wood
mirror and I got a little plant standing
off of Amazon and also I ordered a
runner rug so I'll show you guys out
probably in this vlog if they come in
think they will and also need some
random knick-knack things for like the
floating shelves in the hallway and
that's kind of the last apartment thing
I really am looking for so I'm going to
head up a couple of the antique stores
consignment stores there's also like a
ballard reused I think it's called
dollars just a town in Seattle they
don't have anything there I might go
down to soda which is like South Seattle
and there's also a bunch of antique
consignment kind of stores there so I'm
going to take guys along on return vlog
and I just found out like 30 minutes ago
that I'm going to LA this weekend in
like three days look for your cosmetic
for an event which I'm super excited
about I'm excited to finally meet them
because I've been working with them for
like a couple years now but I've never
actually met them so it'll be fun so I
need to get a lot done before then oh my
god this girl has an Aussie it's so cute
it's so freaking cute
I miss Parker but let's get some mirrors
and a knife some Starbucks going back
through the drive-thru
this is so cool if you don't like
outwards DIY sings like a heaven right
now
this place is never acting like a corner
a ballard reuse didn't have any big
mirrors but that was so freakin unreal i
want to go there every single day and
just walk around if you're into like
antiques are just things even like
upscale and stuff that was like a mecca
and it was all hella cheap like they had
the window panes and doors and start the
doors are more expensive but the window
panes were like four dollars or two
seven dollars so if you need that kind
of stuff for like a wedding or event or
whatever it was huge was like
never-ending I can't believe I've never
been there before then I checked out
goodwill since it was right next to
there and I didn't find a mirror again
but I did find a few things I'll show
you guys and then I also realized I
probably need to get something to wear
for the two events this weekend Pier one
is where there my little pony eyeshadow
palette which is all like bright colors
and stuff I think I want to try and get
like a colored dress don't have very
many colored dresses but I friggin
scored at Goodwill I've actually been
looking at these little cute plant
stands and I got this one for 399 but I
got this little pot for it which fits
perfectly and I'll just put a fake plant
in there so one was 99 cents and then I
also found this path of Body Works cute
candle holder and this was $1.99 alright
guys so it's the next morning last night
I was just working the rest of the night
so I didn't flog at all and I just
filmed actually filmed a one a 15 days
of Foundation and film in it right now
I'm about to go on another Starbucks run
we're really addicted bagel cream cheese
and turkey bacon so so good right now
so I'm going to go hop in the car I'll
show you guys what I ended up getting
from TJ Maxx when I come back I've still
been looking on offer up for what
mirrors can't find anything just don't
know about getting it delivered I guess
is just the order went online
um I still try and eat like I say I eat
about ninety percent gluten free not
doing good the past two days but in my
apartment I only have gluten free things
but then if I'm like out I want to enjoy
some bread I will but I need to cut it
back because I actually feel like it
helps my body a little bit when I cut it
out anyways I'm going to drive my bagel
for the time being
okay this is probably the coolest thing
a received in PRS is our haired my
heritage DNA thank you like actually can
send this back and find out everything
you've ever wanted to know about
yourself
whoa this is so crazy
oh yes you do a full-on mouth swab I'm
definitely doing this this is so cool we
just take a moment of appreciation for
this packaging - oh my god that is
beautiful
chilling on a blanket on the floor I got
that Lefroy we realized to actually have
a lot of stuff to haul for you guys it's
going to be like a giant haul this
entire blog but kind of like final home
decor stuff if the random clothes and
stuff but actually went to home goods a
couple days ago when I was in Bellevue
got heavy air with my friend and early
went to home goods
well these are heavy so I have a few
home goods back here I think I got from
home goods and another big plan are you
sure my apartment is like 50% savings in
50-foot plans so this place but this
one's for a big cactus actually looks
pretty legit and I love this spot that
they happen this was normally $28 I got
for $14.99 I actually already put this
on the shelf in the entryway and it
looks perfect right there so as far as
plates and bowls and silverware and all
that I had enough stuff from my old
apartment to kind of hold me over but so
kind of on the lookout for dishes I
really enjoy decorating and getting home
stuff if you guys can tell so I didn't
want to like brush anything I kind of
just wanted to wait and if I see dishes
and stuff that are like get them I don't
want to like orders on behind I ended up
finding the perfect dishes I love the
color of these probably will be hard to
see true to color on camera but they're
like this super super pale light gray
with a tiny bit of like light blue stuff
so mostly just like a school tone of
gray color it has its length bumpy's
detailing on the outside so I got four
of these I think you should use where
$4.99
HomeGoods actually got five total here
they all are just is very large kind
of like the look of like mismatching
bowls and stuff and this one was very
questionable this one I still can't tell
if it's ugly or cute but I was drawn to
it so I got it flower polka dot Rose
kind of thing I don't know I just really
liked it and this is like my size cereal
glory here tonight size Bowl for the
grape krispies and then the other Bowl I
got is by the same brand as those plates
it looks the same with like still coming
outside but this is like a light mint
kind of teal color was 399 really these
two with a couple of more like pastel
colors bold to look really cute I've got
a candle I actually did really good on
the candles core moving I burned through
like all of my bath and Bodyworks ones
except for I think too that I brought
over two or three but this is the sea
salt fresh aquatic cool $7.99 and it's
really nice and heavy I love the look of
this so super cute it has little X's on
there and it's really nice color blue
gray it does smell like a man candle but
it's also very fresh and kind of has
like a laundry man scent to it I got
some new coasters it's cool because they
look like wood from far away I thought
they would go really well the living
room but they're actually tile or like
ceramic these were $6.99 who house the
quick focus almost look like a little
bit marble - there were so many freaking
cute gift bags I always have like a back
stock cards gift bags tissue paper you
never know when you're going to need to
do someone to get you know saying
whenever I see cute gift sighs I buy
them actually got this one with my
friend in mind who is having a baby oil
they won in the North Carolina if not
when the nail cursor babies present and
this bag is so cute has like the rose
gold kind of copper on it
hopefully she doesn't watch this I don't
think she watches my videos but she zips
up the doughnut so I got her this
doughnut card which actually matches the
bag like perfectly and I got two gift
bags for you guys over wins the giveaway
then we'll be doing this isn't going to
fit all the stuff in it but another just
acute like package smocks really cute
this baggage is felt compelled by and
then paired with it and do this gift bag
this one just says for a gift green
thank you together are super cute and to
go with that one I got this little card
just those free hugs there's little
cactus on it
Oh carrots or other cards that don't no
one was for my friend and this one is
for her baby three of these are just
superseded together and colors are
perfect that's everything I got at home
guys I wanted to show you guys this that
I said in the mail today this is a
blanket that I got off of Amazon I love
the colors of this pretty affordable for
a blanket and whoo I like the material
doesn't feel like Supergirl and that one
material does warm but not like itchy or
anything then it has a little fringe on
the bottom another thing guys is going
to be working the rest and I am trying
to get a head for LA this weekend so
probably won't log anymore tonight but
I'm going to show you guys and I was on
things come in tomorrow when I get that
set up by the way I wanted to tell you
guys I didn't end up wearing either of
these dresses for this photo shoot
because I decided I'm actually going to
wear one of these to the LA event
I think the peach one might actually be
perfect for that and then I'm going to
bring this one to LA too just in case I
just filmed the video on this locally
actually I don't know if it'll have gone
up yet this video will be going up first
actually you guys will be seeing and
coming soon but it's makeup for photos
what I wear when I take Instagram photos
that will be coming on my lips is bang
bang by Smashbox always on my lipstick I
feel like this is like the perfect red
what we should I love it and the rest of
my makeup details you guys will see in
that video but the Amazon things for the
hallway did come in so I'll show you
guys I have it all set up okay so now
when you come down the hallway here's
what you see I think the rug actually
could have been a little bit longer but
I love the color and stuff of it and it
was like 25 bucks 30 bucks off of Amazon
which is ridiculously cheap especially
for like a person looking kind of rug it
looks
feels like nice quality not shedding or
anything ignore my outfit right now I'm
like half filling the entire half
workout shorts I think this would look
50 times better with a would me right
here so I think I still am going to be
on the hunt for a Woodmere but I love
how it looks with the hanging plant
thing in the plant stand then Stan was
also from Amazon and then here are the
little entryway shelves right now I
still want something that's not green on
here I think on this one but at least we
have things on it now so that is in back
this log and is actually a ton of
footage already I think I'm going to end
this one here hope you guys enjoyed it
