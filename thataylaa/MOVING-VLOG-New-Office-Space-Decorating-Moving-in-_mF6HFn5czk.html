future self has actually come into you
right now because right when this vlog
is going up my liquid lipstick just went
live 15:48 it's on my list
right now I didn't announcement video
talking about the products well why I
named it what I did the process I've
lost some of it so that video will be
down below if you miss it but linked by
the lipstick is also down below I self
and the pink hue team worked really hard
to make sure it was a perfect shade and
formula and everything that I was going
for so I really hope you guys enjoy it
10 a.m. Pacific time 1:00 p.m. Eastern
time Thursday December 15 so that is the
official lunch so if you're watching
this right now it is live
let's get into the moving vlog all right
so today it is what is it November 30th
I just got back from San Diego last
night I just filmed two videos I wasn't
actually planning on vlogging today and
I just got a super exciting email and
I'm actually about to go sign the lease
on a new office space which I am super
excited about I talked a little bit
about it in the shadow entry so it's
actually on this looks what it filmed
today I'm gonna take off these false
lashes put on a change of clothes well
that's crazy what's the difference I'm
going to change my clothes and then
we're going to go head over to the new
office I'm going to sign the lease and
I'm going to show you guys a space my
dad is actually coming this Friday on
the first or second to help me move I
have a ton of new furniture and desk and
everything that's going to be moved over
into the new space so I think I'm going
to vlog it all alright so I am here
in the new office I am so excited of
course right when I just looked out the
cameras the freaking cement trucks
outside right now so hopefully you can
hear me so I'm going to give you as many
empty tour it's actually pretty big this
is me standing in one corner there's two
doors we have a sink right there which
is nice grey floor white wool feel and I
had to choose Windows right here for
natural light coming in I have two
plants down right now but I'm hoping I
can get my background for YouTube videos
without the things like we'll probably
just actually sit right here and it'll
probably cut out the doors too so I'll
probably be decorating this part of it
the background of my videos just like
make it looser filling I know hopefully
I can start filming in here next soon
it's super equally right now because
there's nothing in here I can't believe
this I'm actually not going to be
working out of my house and filming on
my bedroom and basically living my
entire makeup collection over here and
doesn't have some home by bringing my
IKEA drawer over here so everything is
going to be here I want it all in my
bedroom so it is the night before the
move I'm literally putting all my makeup
from this thing into plastic bags and
then it's going into boxes and suitcases
my dad comes in like 10 hours pretty
much last minute packing and a ton of
work to do they attempted you catch up
on stuff now I now have a second pile of
stuff going over on over here and now
where the heck I'm putting this this is
all super messy right now but I realized
I'm probably have to buy doubles of some
of the stuff I use on a daily basis like
this is all the stuff I use pretty much
on the regular I've never stood in my
life so here's all my concealers and
stuff eyeliner mascara all this stuff
like my chart shape table probably by
double of just I can keep one here and
one at the other place my favorite
powder is like stargazer
just don't have to lug everything back
and forth then in here I'm keeping some
my short pallets at the moment I'll
probably switch these out every once in
a while and same with the foundations
but if I'm going to be getting ready at
home and not filming and I still be able
to have lip set some of them some of my
favorite foundation so I have kind of a
combo of favorite ones and one thing I
just want to try out more in here I need
to try out the two should clot more and
decide if I want to keep this or not
because we're going to
pensive edge of the whole video honest
during the first series of 50 News
Foundation and then I'm trying out a
bunch of mixers for the white mixer
video which I've been saying I'm doing
for forever and then I have my tart
reinforcements see Josie Maran Argan
Louella BB cream tart no not chart it
cosmetics easy all of these doors are
now empty pretty much need to be clean
desperately I got these nail polish
racks actually which you guys will see
once we have them up but I got these
nail polish racks to hang and their
separate racks or I think I'm actually
going to space them out so there's
enough room to put foundations on and I
tested it out and foundations do fit in
it so in case you're going to have like
front nail racks with foundations on the
wall so I'm not sure if I need this
anymore I might keep this here this is
from Hobby Lobby by the way I get a lot
of questions about this alright so it is
the next morning it is Friday December
2nd woke up to text saying that my dad
has a flu and he isn't able to come help
me move so that was kind of a bummer but
obviously it's ok I hope my dad feels
better so I canceled the u-haul and
everything we're going to try and see if
he can come next weekend hopefully he
feels better by then kind of baiting
just getting movers but my dad was going
to help like put together furniture and
everything and we're just going to have
a fun Seattle trip so I hope you can
still come so that means moving actually
isn't happening for another like weeks
basically since I already have all my
makeup packed up it's kind of hard to
film right now I literally don't even
have like have like five brushes back
there I've got to film right now
foundation Friday on the Tarte Amazonian
clay foundation this will be up before
this vlog goes up so you guys will have
already seen that so I'm going to film
today I'm actually going to I think go
pick up some stuff that I wasn't able to
do before
for the office as good a nice now that I
have an extra week I'm not like rushing
around I can actually get what I need to
get so it is now Monday December 5th and
it eventually snowing today here in
Seattle it is moving day the movers are
coming in like a half-hour I forgot I
have to go get cash so I'm about to go
find an ATM in the snow let's do this
this is so exciting it's probably not
going to stick because the ground is
like straight up wet right now it's
still very exciting for Seattle all
right so the movers just finished up we
have everything in here so it's
there's the makeup drawers hard like
major construction going on outside I'm
hoping this is a mess everyday kind of
thing they did that
hello fast look they got to my house at
10 o'clock and it is now 11:48 so here's
my Alex stories I have two of the six
story unit stacked on top of each other
this is the same thing that I had in my
apartment that I was using store makeup
in right now I have all my makeup in
that suitcase in that suitcase oh I need
to unpack those and organize them in
there again so now that the IKEA drawers
are out of here I think I'm going to get
rid of that thing and I actually ordered
two like mock IKEA Alex 9 door unit
things that I'm going to stack right
here they're just smaller than my old
ones so I'm going to have some makeup
and stuff to store in here and also want
to get rid of this thing my alarms going
off so this is what I got from my room
here at home these you can get off of
Amazon I'm gonna link them down below
because if you don't have an idea by you
or you don't want to make the trip or
whatever these two shipped were like a
hundred dollars cheaper than the IKEA
Alex nine drawers and they look like the
exact same things it comes in white and
black I've two of them right here I'm
just going to take the rollers off on
one of them and stack them and they're
just more narrow than the other drawers
I had also off of Amazon I ordered this
jewelry stand thing because all my
jewelry used to be inside the drawers
and now I kind of won just put it on top
and actually be able to see it so I got
this thing as like 15 bucks 20 bucks on
Amazon it just post meets my favorite
cafe and I get the original yumbul with
extra tofu there's like amazingness
under here well there's a shift on the
tofu in here that is like beans rice
cheese avocado down here similar whoops

paperwhite brand-new a laundry timer if
I'm this in the bottom of that white
storage thing totally forgot I had this
Ashley gave this to us for new employees
at one of my jobs and I just never used

charge it alright so it is Tuesday live
it is a second and put these things on I
remembered I have an Amazon Prime now
order coming right now that's going to
be Sunday answering the door I slept so
bad last night I think I went to sleep
finally at like 4:00 a.m. it is now 8
o'clock so I've had 4 hours of sleep a
lot of random things we need to get done
today these by the way are amazing
they're super cheap they're from Amazon
I've ordered them like three times now
in a pack I'll show you so down to a
nice neutral face now you get them in a
packet like this I'll link them down
below but they're just especially if you
put these in the refrigerator these are
freaking amazing they're just super
cooling and actually feel like they help
deep puff my under eyes a little bit oh
it's really nice out today remember it's
a nice day in Seattle it's like well put
alone in the world
I just reading in here so now I'm
officially going to be a site for the
delivery guy but I have all this long
beautiful that I did last night I'm just
going to watch a couple of YouTube
videos while I do this
so this was the shirt that I got for
Kendall and I and I washed over the
first time right now and it is like
totally faded this was black before
this long is going to be all over the
place I don't even know if I'm putting
yesterday's footage in I basically went
on an entire YouTube branch but today
I'm filming a foundation Friday on the
L'Oreal total clever foundation either
this videos going up first and that
video will be up tomorrow yeah actually
this is going up on Thursday I'm going
to go finish unpacking the makeup at the
office and when I get taco time I think
got taco time it is freaking freezing in
here I just cranked up the heaters was
there on all the way so I have all of
this to still put away I got that
toothpaste done that one's empty so I
still have all this makeup to put in
there we've got some chips and guac
there we go that's a little better you
guys will see how well this holds up
throughout the day because I'm eaten I'm
doing stuff you'll see how well is left
I think it's going pretty well I got all
the brushes put away pretty much I mean
that entire suitcase is empty now
that's all foundation think I'm going to
hang the foundation probably against
this thing actually or maybe a bug here
just so I can actually see all them and
they're not in jorts
so here is all powders translucent
powder pressed powder this is going to
be myself to bring some of my makeup
over from my apartment so I'm going to
have my most used concealers in here and
then these are all concealers that are
like too dark or just where they start
the entire collection these are all
primers this is where I didn't know what
to do so I have all of my eyeshadow
palette and these whiskers whiskers with
wicker baskets all these are morphe
palettes and there's like a mix of
drugstore and high-end in here and then
these are just smaller palettes and I'm
basically having a stainless steel
shelving unit right here so I'm probably
going to have to get more baskets and I
kind of want to just put all the
eyeshadow palettes on the
stainless-steel thing these are all
eyeshadows I like the organization of
this way better than how I had them last
time
arms errs and contour palettes down here
that it's easier to stick directly in
the drawer extras more room and I'm use
these as kind of like separators these
are oh yeah liquid lipsticks is
interesting think of enough nudes liquid
lipsticks for the rest of my life here
we have settings freeze mascara mascara
and boxes dark colored eyeliners colored
eyeliners and then cream eyeliner spec
there so then this liquor basket has
stuff that I want to include in shadow
and schmooze videos and rounds a lot
here right now cuz I have a bunch of
stuff in my apartment so that is what's
going on right now I'm going to finish
that one bag and then I'm actually I
think's good for undoing all the makeup
what if I want to try and tackle some of
these boxes my dad's going to be here in
the morning so kind of one just wait it
is snowing right now in Seattle I am so
excited I have my boots all ready to go
for tomorrow I'm writing this bring it
on
I don't know if you guys can see this
but there's actually a good amount of
snow on the ground now
because you
dad is here we are in the new office I'm
going to start unpacking stuff we just
got Starbucks peppermint mocha and
marshmallow dream bar say hi YouTube hi
YouTube cheers everyone we have a lot of
work to do
the
so I got these nail polish racks off of
Amazon I'll link them down below but
they actually hold foundation perfectly
the perfect width to hold bottles so
we're just going to put two of these
next to each other and then do a couple
rows not going to hold all my foundation
so dad is using his bubble on his iPhone
going to hold anything next perfect look
yes I look cool yeah this is our one
good group and then the others are not
as strong you mean that corner this
corner is being Korea so we basically
just measured and we're doing about a
half an inch above my tallest bottle and
then my super tall foundation bottles
like the Urban Decay all nighter those
really tall ones will just go on the top
shelf
everyone oh sorry about it literally
almost all these that the only really
fat ones like the Kat Von D lock-it
which I never use anyway it's too big so
say 99% of them fit all right so it's
now 4 o'clock
4:20 we've been here for I think you
started at 1 o'clock yeah officially
pretty good 3 hours that's really good
what we did okay so I'm going to give
you a minute or I'm going to be doing a
full office tour once everything is
totally on the walls and everything that
will be a separate video but I'll show
you guys is neatly so there's the
foundation hung I have a whole box of
foundations from 15 News foundation that
are gone going to go on there and I
might add one more wrap round up let me
dip this is a cool stainless steel
shelving thing it's actually like a
kitchen utility shelf i think is called
i'm going to be linking everything down
below but from amazon to does putting
together an ikea plant shelf over here
I'm starving are you hungry sweet
Keller okay okay here's a giant mare
from Ikea I'm so excited to have a
mirror for Instagram rugs we felt n roll

few things than we hanging by the desk

white chair monitor that we're going to
be putting together tomorrow we still
have some like random things that we're
going to be hanging and putting together
and wiring tomorrow that's the chair for
filming that is a monitor for filming by
all units for taxes and something
okay so cool there we go okay so it's
the next morning I'm freaking tired
right now I feel like I'm also getting
sick by yesterday we are super
productive we basically just have to
like hang things we're going to go to
Lowe's or Home Depot this morning we're
going to go to this place called El Tana
bagels and Capitol Hill has never been
there before so I'm going to pick up my
god right now and we're going to head
over there then flute and free bagels so
yay for that I totally spaced on
vlogging in last night and I kind of
just wanted to like enjoy time with my
dad but we went to we ended up going to
happy hour at this really cute place and
then we came back rested for a little
bit and then we went to dinner at the
what was it called
Oh but still in ballard which is bomb so
that's what we did last night I got home
at like 11 and then I just woke up at 7
does not like 7:45 so I'm gonna go pick
up my dad I feel like I can't breathe
from this scarf
these these are where and lows you're
not supposed to film in here but okay
we're getting stuff for the office
extension cords surge things very
exciting things
I've been super at vlogging today
but today was just super busy I feel
like today was more intense than
yesterday moving light we went to two
different lows one Home Depot Hobby
Lobby goodwill grand fine random stuff
that I needed to like hang and do
everything so basically end up going all
over Seattle to try and find those
things office is pretty much put
together like I definitely have decor
stuff I need to finish up and I need to
bring over like paper towels and soap
and towel and all that kind of stuff but
as far as everything being put together
and hung and all that that is all done
so all the hard stuff is done now I just
need to get like the right tours and
things like that but my dad was so
helpful I literally could not have done
all of that would have taken me days
like probably a week seriously to do all
the stuff that he did in like a couple
hours so thank you dad if you're
watching really appreciate it he also
helped me put together this thing in my
room which I got off of Amazon will show
you guys I think I mentioned it in the
vlog earlier that this is what I'm going
to be putting instead of this white
thing here it is this is two unit
stacked on top of each other but if the
office is looking really good I feel
like for two days we got a ton done
we just went out to dinner on Capitol
Hill at a youth instil restaurant
reowww reowww XIII or something like
that Rio Rio and that's it it's really
good to tell you in place in Capitol
Hill and then I dropped my dad off it's
like 10 p.m. now I need to try and edit
some of this video so I think I'm going
to edit for a couple hours and then
hopefully go to sleep entity sometime
tomorrow I'm dropping my dad off super
early and then I need to film the
announcement video which you guys will
have already seen on this vlog goes up
I'll be stopping by the office probably
tomorrow to get all the rest of stuff in
there the face mask they have on right
now is the Fremen beautiful avocado
oatmeal clay mask nice mint green
feeling the color I don't have a bra on
right now so so awkward but have my
Gemini astronauts alright guys so it is
now Sunday I dropped my dad off at the
airport this morning and clearly in the
office which is a lot more done than you
guys felt last time I'm not going to
give you a whole tour thing right now
some
a separate video like it said 25 times
now I want to show a few things I just
went to Ross and got some like the core
kind of stuff I'm like half asleep today
I desperately need to relax that I have
so much editing Tuesday and I also need
to pre-record attend this week for when
I'm going to be gone for the holidays so
this week is gonna be a little cray but
it's a good so like I said we got a ton
put together pretty much all in here I'm
just like adding the core things and now
I'm so excited to actually have a desk
and be able to work for the great I'll
show you guys a little peek of this area
that's the bar cart with the Keurig and
everything but I just went to Ross and
found this handle is this not perfection
I was like my favorite Ross line ever
besides this mug that I also just found
at Ross I need to clean you still but
look at gray marble and gold I also got
this mug there today
I just brought over a bag of stuff I
still stuff in there after unload a
little bit but I brought over soap Santo
candle some perfume face masks makeup
remover because I'm obviously going to
be doing and taking off makeup here so
this thing I also found out Ross today
I've been looking for a long tall base
for the banana leaf thing and this is
perfectly precise school with glittery
sparkly especially the desk
it'll show you guys the rug because I'm
obsessed with this this is from rugs USA
I will link it down below a really good
deal as you can get rugs like $200 or
more off seriously that's where I got
the rug in my room at home too I'm not
sure going to be filming videos in here
this week I still to bring over my life
and I could get a second tripod for home
because when I filled foundation Friday
videos they'll show you this so this is
the monitor that I'm going to be able to
hook up to my camera now so I'll
actually be able to see myself on this
screen instead of a time after you find
it as you find our compared to the
screen it's literally like that eggs no
joke I still need to get plants for this
IKEA thing I mean the lights always look
really good there so for a backdrop for
Instagram photos like flatly photos
actually got stick on the wallpaper and
then I got this poster board so I'm just
going to stick these on here and hope it
looks like it actually looks kind of
like cement so cool with the filter on
it no one will ever know so basically
want to do all my product shots and
probably swatches to like when I do the
foundation swatches and videos and
thinking this may be the background will
these are from chasing paper I just
realized I only get to whoops all
right well I'm gonna need to order a few
more of those okay I have a giant thing
of NPCs and I've been meaning to do a
video on but I literally have about
twenty videos on my to film list that I
feel like are more interesting than
empties let's just do a quick end fees
on the blogs these are like I don't know
how long I've had this trash sitting
here this is intense I'm going to power
through this personally I think end
these videos are super interesting
because it's kind of like you can see my
most few stuff or just stuff I used out
that I didn't like so I'm just gonna
tell you if I like it didn't like it
give you the lowdown ignore my messy bed
in the background so good this is also
beauty smoothie buttercream cupcake
shower gel smells good
like the pump on the top would probably
repurchase that I have a bunch of Bath &amp;amp;
Body Earth candles but I don't know why
all and kept one in here by bow ties and
bourbon this is also good - smells like
man tuck it like classy dude shirts and
recently recycle have a giant box here
for recycle stuff flexible hold
hairspray I really like this Harris
Barry would definitely repurchase that
it doesn't give you that like gross and
crispy kind of feel and it also smells
pretty mild I don't like when my hair
spray like takes over because they
usually wear it with you I have a bunch
of these facts and Body Works eucalyptus
mint hand soap foaming I really like the
foaming ones but I feel like I go
through them quicker this is still one
of my favorite face washes this is that
all-in-one acne control daily scrub by
Neutrogena I've been using a different
face wash I think I'm actually going to
have the skin care routine coming soon
because I've gotten a lot of questions
about what I've changed with my skin but
this is still one of my favorites I'll
probably go back to this at some point
but I haven't been using it lately
corrective makeup cleansing wipes
actually did not like it at all
I feel like it just didn't take off my
makeup really well and you can't use it
on your eyes for the headsail feel
confident and pretty sure be pure so
instead of my seller cleansing wipes
these are really good these were sent to
me and I couldn't find in the u.s. where
to actually get these but I totally
would have repurchases if I can figure
out where these are fought from by
stargazer powder I've gone through so
many of these part candy shear and be
hydrating primers I've talked about this
a ton before basically spray it over my
makeup some of you have said that you
like the way it looks but it make sure
it makes your face feel sticky if you
use it over your makeup and I personally
haven't noticed that I don't it doesn't
bother me but I literally only use like
one or two spritzes usually just one
because it's super intense but you could
use this underneath your makeup as well
next dewy finish
long-lasting setting spray I literally
didn't notice any difference whatsoever
in the sweetness or in the finish of it
because a few mascaras here Maybelline
lash sensational I like this one
Cupid spiders insects is my favorite
mascara Maybelline falsies push-up drama
camera runneth out of this one
I have an old plex number three because
my hair is literally like straw still
getting classic clean daily conditioner
I was using this before I went gray so
that's how long some of these have been
sitting in here a few salons gliding
glory smoothing conditioner I really
like you salon products they have bomb
hair like styling products the heat
resistant I really love I believe I have
a 3 for $15 a salon coupon things I'll
put it on the screen and also down below
kenra platinum blow dry shampoo I
actually didn't really like this one I
think it's kind of overrated I always
try hand shampoos and conditioners and I
never like them better than drugstore
ones so a couple more wet and wild under
the sheets makeup remover and morphe
makeup remover both of these I used I'm
pretty sure as like baby wipes when I
film to take off swatches and stuff I
don't think I actually use this on my
face Bath and Body Works Twilight would
you guys have had this since oh my god
