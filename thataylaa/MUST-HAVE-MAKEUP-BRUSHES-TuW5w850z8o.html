Kanye of brushes all right so today we
have the long-awaited make a fresh video
think my eyelash just touched my eyebrow
I am starving right now I just filmed a
look on this video what I just filmed a
makeup look on this so I'll link that
down below since it'll be up first
feeling springy I'm also not wearing
black right now what is life so I'm
going to try and make this as quick into
the point as possible pretty sure this
is my first makeup brush video and may
have done one like three years ago when
I first started YouTube but these are my
favorite favorite brushes I kind of like
to pick and choose and use different
brushes from different brands I don't
have like one go to brand that I think
every brush is amazing if you follow
youtubers or instagramers morphe is very
very hyped up all of the brushes I'm
mentioning for more fear from their
elite collection suffer I think one I
think their elite collection is totally
worth the money really great quality I
haven't had any issues with their elite
collection there are other brushes from
them that I don't really think are the
best quality so these are just my
favorite brushes really are worth the
investment they make your makeup lie so
much better I'm gonna give you a
variation of each kind of brush so you
don't need every single one that I
mentioning if you're just starting out
with makeup you do not need to spend a
 ton of money on makeup brushes
there are some really great affordable
options especially now when I first
started getting into makeup it was kind
of just elf and it was and that was it
there are some really awesome cheap
brushes now and we're going to talk
about them I'm bad beauty guru and
haven't watched any of my brushes before
this video because this is real life my
brushes are dirty right now yeah I use
them all right before this is the 20
minute long intro let's just get into it
so for foundation brushes I have four
that I'm going to share with you guys so
the first one I'm gonna start out with
is this elf foundation brush this may
actually be intended to be a powder
brush I use it to apply liquid
foundation I like this because it's
super compact so if you're blending out
like a full coverage foundation like the
Marc Jacobs remarkable or something this
is a really great brush for that it is
kind of on the smaller side so you have
to work a little bit more but good
affordable option next are two brushes
from Sigma and these are the foundation
brushes that I have used for the longest
I've literally owned these - same exact
brushes since I want to say freshman
year of college so almost six years five
six years which is insane this just
speaks to the quality of Sigma brushes
people give them for like how
expensive they are and these are not
affordable brushes these are like twenty
four dollars each I think but this is
like proof that if you invest in good
brushes it's worth it these have lasted
me so so long and they're just like my
go-to foundation brushes the first one
is the Sigma f80 and it's a flat top
foundation brush so you just blend
liquid foundation with this if you're
looking for a really nice quality
long-lasting brush that you can use for
pretty much any foundation go with the
Sigma f80 the Sigma f80 2 is also a
favorite I feel like this gives me a
little bit better coverage it's a round
top foundation brush so just personal
preference but both these brushes are
great that's option is the morphe 31 and
this one I've been using for the least
amount of time but in the short amount
of time I've been using it I have like
fallen in love with this this is the
biggest one out of the three options I'm
mentioning or four options I'm
mentioning you can see just on my face
in comparison like this is pretty big
they also make a bigger version of this
the bigger version is the e 54 and just
so you can see the size comparisons this
one like covers half of your face so
this one does blend out super fast but I
just prefer this one for some reason
this brush if you're looking for like a
quick way to blend out your foundation
and you don't want to use a sponge this
is like so fast literally you can see in
my full coverage foundation routine
video I just posted link it down below
you can see how quickly this blend out
foundation but it is just amazing their
elite collection is so soft such nice
quality and I'm feeling this and I do
have a 10% off coupon code for all the
morphe brushes I'm mentioning is an
affiliate link so if you decide to use
my code I do make a small percentage
moving on so moving on to powder brushes
to set the under-eye concealer I use two
different powder brushes the one I use
most often is this elf brush and I just
frickin love this for setting my under
eye concealer I don't bake I'm not
someone who can use like when those tiny
brushes would like translucent powder
and it sets my concealer like no I need
a full on compact brush to pack on that
under
cutter or else I lose all the coverage
in my under eye concealer just looks
horrible
so I love this brush again by elf super
affordable and then the other option is
the more PE 48 and I like this because
it's tapered so it just fits perfectly
underneath your eye right here a little
bit smaller than the elf one other thing
I love about Marcia brushes is the
handle like look at how long the handle
is in comparison which just makes it
easier to work with
super soft sets your under eye concealer
really nicely and this brush is easier
to get in that inner corner just because
it is tapered so favorite powder brush
especially in the last few months that
I've discovered this is the Coastal
Scents BR 110 this is like five dollars
or something insane I think this was
made for liquid foundation but I use it
for powder and it works amazing I can't
use a big fluffy brush to put on my
powder it just doesn't give me enough
coverage and again it like takes away
from my foundation that I just put on so
I like to use a flat top brush and I
just basically pounce my powder on my
face rather than like fully blending I
do that afterwards with the brush I'll
show you next
Coastal Scents again is one of those
companies that there are some really
good finds just been loving this I use
this every single day it gives me really
nice coverage it's soft and no
complaints so far then the Big Kahuna of
brushes this is the morphe u 41 it's
like you know you're badass this is like
the Kanye of brushes this thing is
freaking huge this is like my microphone
brush because God can you just this is
like the best lip syncing brush this
thing is so big I like to use this to
blend out all of my blush and highlight
and everything on my face when I'm done
with my face so I'll just go in like go
like this there are so many bristles in
here the actual base is huge because
there's so many bristles packed in here
so soft you could also use this to set
with like translucent powder if you just
want a light dusting a powder on your
face alright moving into contour and
blush favorite contour efore easy by
morphe this is like hands down my
favorite contour brush bronzer is the
same thing for bronzer and contour if
you're someone who uses like a bigger
brush for bronzer then you can use one
of the blush brushes that I'm about to
mention next but for contour just
getting into your cheekbones that you 4
by morphe is amazing in the video on
this look I used a lot of the brushes I
mentioned
so if you want to see them like in
action you can go watch that video but
yep nothing much more to say about this
so blush I have three different options
either of these you could go with this
is the morphe 35o been my favorite blush
brush lately it just blends it out
beautifully it doesn't take away any of
the pigment if you're using like a
highly pigmented blush you might want to
go with a stippling brush which I'll
show you next but for just everyday good
old blush brush you can use this one or
the Real Techniques blush brush this is
actually the multitask brush so you
could use this for powder too like an
all-over face powder you could use this
for bronzer you can use it for blush and
this is like $6 or something from Ulta
so either these are really good options
if you want more of like a light
coverage situation if you have a super
pigmented blush you'll probably want to
go in with a stippling brush this is my
favorite one because it's angled and it
just blends it gives you like this
airbrushed kind of look and this is the
it cosmetics I don't know what brush
there's actually no name on this if I
can find this I'll link it down below
but if not Sedona lace makes a really
good stippling brush but this is just
one I like because again it is angled so
highlight brushes I nailed it down to
two because these are my most used first
one is the morphe M 5 10 feels so
typical beauty guru for mentioning this
but it honestly is such a good highlight
brush I used it today to apply my
highlight there's something about this
that really brings out the highlight in
the highlight if you know what I'm
saying I think this is probably like
goat hair by the look of it I'm not
really sure this isn't from the early
collection if I'm not using that brush
I'm using the Real Techniques angled
highlighter brush and this kind of
surprised me because it's not something
I would typically choose for like a
highlighter just because it is pretty
densely packed but it does apply your
highlight really beautifully it is
angled so it's nice for like the top of
the cheekbones you could use this as a
nose contour or two if you're into that
I don't never know this contour but if
you do this would be a nice brush for
that too all right we have a ton of
eyeshadow brushes to talk about I'm
going to go super quickly through these
I'm going to go an order of like how
high my eyeshadow so first you need a
blending brush this is like a must if
you're just building your makeup kit and
you're looking to invest in brushes you
need a blending brush this is the morphe
27 perfect for blending eyeshadow
into your crease if you're using like a
transition shade or just doing a super
basic look you need a blending brush
this is great it's a perfect size super
soft no complaints next I would say this
is an optional brush this is the morphe
e 22 I like this because it has this
angled point to it so it's a blending
brush but it's also really good at
getting color in that outer V and
blending at the same time not totally
necessary but I do use this pretty
frequently and I like it next one which
I would definitely recommend and say
this is necessary is the BR 250 by
Coastal Scents this is like a couple
dollars and it is such a nice brush this
is similar to the Mac 215 or 210 I can
never remember what the number is but
it's not brush that every brand makes
morphe makes one Sedona lace makes one
Sigma makes one like this the Coastal
Scents one is actually my favorite for
some reason this is perfect for putting
shadow into your crease the good thing
about these brushes is that you can
actually turn it and get this more
precise application or you can flip it
and use it to blend so I would
definitely say get this if you're
building a makeup kit another must is
the BRC so8 by Coastal Scents as you see
this is a lot tinier that's a blending
brush but it's really tiny so just packs
on the color really nicely but it blends
at the same time this is like super
affordable like a couple dollars so why
not favorite brush to apply lid shadow
and disclaimer like eight out of ten
times I just use my finger to actually
apply my lid color I just feel like I
get the best color payoff when I use my
finger but if I'm not using my finger or
if I want to like spray my brush with
fix+ or something and then apply an
eyeshadow to my lid I use the Coastal
Scents BRS 52 brush this is like when
the only brushes I found that doesn't
take away a ton of the pigment when you
apply it on your lid that's why I
usually just don't use a brush right
this one doesn't and it is really nice
for also applying pigment if you like a
loose pigment that you're applying or a
cream shadow or anything like that you
can use this brush this is a total must
to me whether it's by this brand or
another brand that this is a Sedona lace
904 this is the softest one I found this
is what I use for blending shadow on my
lower lash line I've been using this for
a few years now and it's like change the
makeup game for me you need
some kind of small blending brush for
your lower lashline in my opinion I have
one by Sigma I have them by morphe this
is my favorite because it doesn't make
my eyes water when I'm using it used it
today which is why it's pink then if you
want an even smaller version of that the
morphe m5 15 is the smallest brush I've
probably ever seen for blending
eyeshadow the good thing about this is
you can use it for applying like more
precise application on your lower
lashline or you can also use it to blend
our smudge out eyeliner just how you sit
in my Mad Men tutorial it is a little
bit scratchy which I don't like this is
the smallest brush of this kind I've
seen eyebrow brush I use is this total
ace EB 23 not a whole lot to say about
this it's just an angled eyebrow brush
so if you're applying like powder or gel
I use this with my anastasia dipbrow and
it's just an oldie but a goodie I've
used this for years and no complaints
alright so that was everything I feel
like I actually powered through that
