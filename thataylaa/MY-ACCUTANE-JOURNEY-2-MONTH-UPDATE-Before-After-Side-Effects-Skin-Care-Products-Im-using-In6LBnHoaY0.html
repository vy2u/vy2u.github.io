keep an entire tube of aquaphor in your
purse and you literally have to pee
every five minutes
all right so instead of foundation
Friday this week we're gonna be doing a
little skin update since I've now been
on accutane for two months which is
crazy I feel like it's been like a week
before you watch anymore this video
definitely make sure you've seen my
first accutane related video it was the
acne story talking about my history ten
years of having acne what I've already
tried and my decision to go on accutane
so I'm gonna link that video down below
at the top of the description box and in
the eye over here
go watch that video first because I'm
not going to touch on anything that I
talked about in that video this video is
gonna be an update on my first two
months on accutane to show you guys
before and after pictures I'm going to
show you a picture is one month in and
just talk about some of the side effects
I've experienced so far I didn't want to
do a one month video because it really
wouldn't have been a whole lot to talk
about would have literally just been me
showing you my face so here we go I'm
excited to update you guys I know a lot
of you have been asking about this on
social media and definitely make sure
you're following me on my social media
right here because that's where I kind
of show you guys I've showed you on
snapchat and Twitter skin updates and
just things I've been experiencing
little disclaimer that I'm gonna mention
in every action video this is just my
experience with accutane I'm not telling
you to go in accutane a chain is a super
serious drug do your own research for me
when I was doing my own research and
kind of deciding if this is something
that I wanted to do YouTube is one of
the places that I went videos like this
were super helpful for me so that is my
intent and doing this I'm just sharing
my personal experience I'm gonna kind of
go just in chronological order things
I've been experiencing starting with
month one and then up to this point I do
have notes I wrote them down here we go
if you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you're
new here and you want to continue to
follow along this journey you can join
the burrito family and subscribe I
upload every Monday Wednesday Friday at
6 p.m. Pacific time alright so starting
from the beginning I did get a weird
reaction the first day I took it I've
logged it I'm not gonna go into it
because I basically talked about it in
that vlog so link that down below but I
basically was advised to wait a couple
days and then try again with a big fatty
meal that's how you're supposed to take
these pills I have taken one of the
pills on an empty stomach and I was
throwing up for like three hours so
definitely take these with a full on
meal or you know some kind of healthy
fatty foods though the second kind of
time a few days later that I actually
started it was totally fine I started
around October 15th
so my pills there's different brands of
the drug that you can take
and the one that I was prescribed is
called my orison and it looks like this
I take 30 milligrams two times a day now
but for the first month I only took 30
milligrams one time a day that's what my
dermatologist suggested that's how most
dermatologists do it you kind of ease
into the drug get half the dose and then
on the second month you do two times a
day the full dose so they do it by body
weight some people are on 80 milligrams
some people are on 60 milligrams so I'm
on 60 and the way that I do it just so I
don't forget a pill is I actually write
the date on the top and bottoms since I
do take two a day now so like today's
the 14th when I filming this December
14th so I took one this morning and then
I'll take one at night and I just number
it every single time so I wrote down the
day nine was the first sight of slight
dryness that was the time to start that
was the first day that I started getting
slightly dry day 28 is when I started
getting slightly dry eyes which I still
have my eyes are always kind of red and
bloodshot especially if I'm like staring
at a screen all day so I don't notice it
to be necessarily any worse than usual
but I do have dry eyes and I do have red
eyes blink the eye drops I use down
below now I have not experienced the
major major major dryness and I solely
think that's because of the amount of
water I've been drinking and the
products I've been using since day one
the dermatologists both times was kind
of shocked at how not dry my skin was
and I really think that everything I've
been using has been helping so I'm gonna
be having a video coming out in a few
weeks on the products that I've been
using but I've got some messages from
you guys saying that you're starting
accutane are you currently on it and you
want to know what I'm using so just a
quick my top three that I would say
definitely get like I said um and have a
whole video talking more about
everything else I'm using but these are
like my top 3 must-haves for accutane
right now the survey hydrating cleanser
mentioned this in raves and rejects the
CeraVe skin renewing night cream this
stuff is amazing I use it at night and
then the Aqua for healing ointment this
is what I use on my lips and these 3
huband lifesavers I think these have
helped a shit-ton when you're on
accutane you want to stay super super
super hydrated not only is it gonna help
the dryness but your liver and
everything are going through some tough
times so definitely stay overly hydrated
so I already drink a lot of water but
basically I've been
drinking about eight to ten of these
this size bottle a day and I think that
has helped a ton with the dryness as
well I try to drink as much of these as
possible
I want my pee to be clear you know I'm
saying I mean I literally have to pee
every 20 minutes joint pain is really
common on accutane because your joints
are basically not lubricated at all for
those of you who are new here or don't
know I have chronic pain to begin with
so my body hurts every single day I have
spinal issues neck issues and chronic
migraines so pain for me is relative
like I do feel joint pain but I've felt
that before and I feel muscle pain and
nerve pain and everything else so it
doesn't really affect me I could see how
if you're someone who lives a pain-free
life to begin with and you feel pretty
good every day this might be something
that would affect you more for me it's
really not bad with that being said some
days I do feel like I'm 90 years old
it's a little bit worse since being on
accutane like some days when I stand up
my joints and everything really feel
like I'm 50 years older it's kind of
hard to separate what's coming from the
accutane and watch just my usual body
stuff something that a lot of you guys
have asked me about is if my migraines
have gotten worse headaches and
migraines can be a side effect of
accutane and I can kind of tell what my
usual migraines are versus other
migraines so for example when I'm on my
period I can tell period migraines
versus my usual migraines and I do feel
like I've had a few more other kind of
migraines and I typically have not to
the point where I would you know stop
taking accutane or anything I already
get five migraines a week so it hasn't
really affected my life any more than my
migraines already do I just take my
usual imitrex and hope that I'm not
bedridden the rest of the day alright so
moving into month two so every single
month on accutane you have to do an I
pledge quiz which basically says you
know you acknowledge that you're gonna
use birth control and all this stuff
because you can't get pregnant while
you're in acting you also do monthly
blood tests and then you have a
dermatologist appointment some
dermatologists require you to go in two
times a month mine requires me to go in
one time a month right after the lab
work is done you have to be really
strict about the dates that you get your
lab work done I'm not gonna go into that
cuz you're thermo Matala just will tell
you all about it but there's basically a
window that you have to get all this
done so if you're gonna be planning any
trips and stuff like I'm going
the country in January so I had to kind
of plan my trip around when I could go
in to get the lab work done and have the
appointment so just keep that in mind so
when I got blood work done a couple
years ago for other health issues they
found out that I have really high
cholesterol and they don't know why it
is genetic but for my age it's way too
high it was like 240 doctors seemed to
think that something else is triggering
it so I still don't know what that
something else is when I started
accutane my cholesterol was down to I
think it started at 210 or 213 so after
the month one blood work my cholesterol
did go up a little bit and accutane
spikes your cholesterol which is why
that's something that they test for so I
think after month one my cholesterol was
at about 220 I want to say so just went
up a little bit she said she wanted to
keep monitoring everything else a month
when blood work seemed to be fine so I'm
gonna start a photo right here before I
started accutane this was taken the day
that I filmed the acne story video and
then here's the photo that was taken on
my month one blood test so this was
exactly a month later I mean I was kind
of shocked how fast my skin started
clearing up I started seeing my skin
clear up within about two weeks and you
guys started noticing on snapchat and in
videos and everything but after month
one there was a pretty significant
difference I didn't have major cystic
spots anymore
my skin looked a lot smoother everyone's
experienced a totally different some
people don't start seeing it clear up
until month three or four some people
have a purge phase during month one I
actually didn't have a purge phase at
all so that was really great that was
kind of something that I was prepared
for if it happened but I didn't
experience that at all which was amazing
super happy about that and now going
into month two someone - as far as my
skin I definitely had some ups and downs
that I think was solely because of some
different products I was trying out I
tried out too many things at once I got
way too excited about skincare and I
kind of started throwing and random
products at the same time and my skin
was kind of freaking out so one thing
that I found is an absolute no for me
which happens to work amazing for a lot
of people with acne is jojoba oil
something about jojoba oil my skin hated
not only did it cause me to breakout but
I had weird weird
roughness on my forehead I was getting
closed comedones which I liked a little
white under the skin kind of bumps by
the way I have no makeup on my face
right now besides some face highlighter
that's it no concealer anything so this
is what my skin is looking like right
now a lot of this most of this is
scarring I can feel some like tiny bumps
down here like on my chin but most of
this is all scarring right now jojoba
oil was a major note for me I kind of
cut it out and then I tried to bring it
back in to make sure it was that and it
a hundred percent was the home oil that
was causing that I've never felt my face
to feel so rough it literally felt like
I had sandpaper like some of the
sandpaper in my forehead
not a good look so I cut that out of my
routine tried some other stuff to month
- my skin was kind of up and down but I
think that was just because of the
products but now that I have this
routine down with my skin it has been
pretty much like this the last few weeks
a couple of days here and there pop up
know when you look at your face so much
I feel like especially with filming it's
kind of hard to see the big changes that
happen you notice when you have is it or
when you don't have visit or when your
skin looks clearer than usual but you
don't really see the big picture in my
case until I go back and like look at
old footage I posted the a PDG
foundation Friday video and that was
filmed before accutane and holy shit
that was kind of like a wake-up call for
me I didn't realize how much my skin had
cleared up until I went back and saw
that video that I just posted it's just
insane I mean I went home from
California I just got back last night my
whole family was complimenting me on my
skin which is something that I have
never experienced it just felt really
good because like I said I I got so used
to having acne that I just kind of
rocked it for so many years and it
didn't really affect my confidence a
whole lot but when people start
complimenting you on your skin which I
never used to get complimented on it
just feels really good something that
I've noticed as my skin is very red so
even when I had acne I would still go to
the house if they like it talked about
in that video I'd put on some spot
concealer but my skin like underneath
the acne wasn't super super red kind of
hard to tell on camera I think but my
skin is definitely pretty red and that
is
thing that you know the accutane can
cause I do wear sunscreen when I go out
you get fried on a keychain so
definitely wear an SPF even if I'm
outside for like 15 minutes I'll put on
a sunscreen because I learned my lesson
the hard way there so let's talk about
the two-month side-effects at this point
so the biggest one for me has been
eczema I've never had eczema before at
first I actually thought I was having an
allergic reaction to a food that I ate
because it happened within like a couple
hours after I ate dinner one night and I
started noticing it on my hands my hands
got super red can't really oh you can
see a little bit on camera my hands are
super dry it kind of comes and goes I've
been using the Aveeno lotion and then my
dermatologist gave me a steroid cream to
use so I'm gonna start using that but I
noticed it getting way worse when I was
traveling and I don't know if that's
just because it was like 80 degrees in
San Diego and I didn't like the heat or
whatever the last night I took a picture
it's pretty much like all down my arm
right now and there's some super dry
kind of Boerne patches though has gotten
worse in the last like week but I'm just
gonna be putting that cream on and it
should go away so nothing bad it's not
like painful or anything it's just kind
of there and actually wrote down
November 16th this when I started
experiencing the eczema so I was right
about right after the one month point so
after the two-month doctor's appointment
in lab results cholesterol still going
up so not great I started taking milk
thistle extract so this is basically an
herbal supplement I got this off of
Amazon it's supposed to help with your
liver and your cholesterol lower your
cholesterol so both my doctor and my
pharmacist which I've gotten real tight
with said that it was a great idea that
I started taking this so I've been
taking this for about three weeks now
and I just take a thousand milligrams so
just one pill and I take this with lunch
usually just I'm not taking too many
pills at night or in the morning so I do
take other pills so this is kind of what
I'm doing to help lower my cholesterol
and then also I'm supposed to be on a
Mediterranean diet
I'm trying it saw was the only bad thing
on the lab work as far as my skin and
everything she said my back like
completely cleared up I don't really
have anything on my back I did have not
bad acne on my back but I definitely had
it there and on my shoulders I'm still
getting it a little bit on my neck but a
lot of this is scarring but the
dermatologist was very happy with the
results she seemed the kind of like
happier than I
she seemed like between the minimal side
effects and minimal dryness and
everything everything is just going
really well so that made me happy I'm
just kind of crossing my fingers and
hoping that minimal side effects and
everything stay throughout the rest of
the four months because right now it's
been really great so suicidal thoughts
and depression are a side effect of
accutane and when I asked her about it
she said that it kind of just awakens if
you will you already have depressive
tendencies and I don't I've never
experienced depression I've never
experienced really anxiety or anything
so I haven't had any of those thoughts
I've been really great mentally I had
one kind of weird down day but also
should note this I'm taking gabapentin
to for my migraines as like a
preventative next stuff so I've actually
upped the dose of that since I've been
on accutane so I am trying to
distinguish what side effects are from
that and what side effects are from
accutane I can't think of anything else
if you guys have any specific questions
or things they want me to answer in the
three-month kind of skincare check-in
video let me know down below I've kind
of taken your questions from Twitter and
snapchat and everything and I hope I
answered them all in this video
I feel like there was something else I
wanted to touch on but I can't remember
what it was I went throughout my notes I
hope this video was helpful for you guys
thank you for the amazing response after
the acne story video again this is just
my experience I'm not telling you to go
on accutane it's a personal decision but
if this was helpful for you don't forget
to give it a thumbs up this video is
gonna be in a acne related playlist down
below so you can go watch other videos
