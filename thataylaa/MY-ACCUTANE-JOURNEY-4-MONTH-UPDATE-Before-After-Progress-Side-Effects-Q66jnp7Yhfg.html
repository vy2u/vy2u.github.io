something actually work for the first
time
all right so today we're gonna be doing
a little accutane update I've now been
on accutane for four months I'm going
into month five right now which is so
wild I feel like it's been to like two
or three months to is my last like
official update I did I've been giving
you guys updates throughout different
chatter schmooze videos and foundation
Fridays and stuff you can go back
through videos too and kind of see the
progress happening but I'm gonna leave
munchies update down below if you want
to know kind of what I was dealing with
back then any side effects and stuff I
was experiencing how the dryness was
back then I would definitely watch that
video first if you haven't seen that yet
also watch my acne story video that goes
really in-depth about my acne history
this video is just literally gonna be my
current update any things I've noticed
in the past couple months before and
after photos and then also answering
your guys's Twitter questions here we go
if your side for this video don't forget
to give it a thumbs up if you're new
here you can join the BAE Rito family
and subscribe upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time
let's get into the update I just ate
like 5000 chips and salsa feeling like I
can't move like I say in every accutane
related video I'm not endorsing accutane
I'm simply sharing my experience with it
in hopes that it helps in hopes that it
helps hopefully it can help some of you
guys out who are either on it or who are
looking into it do your own research
everyone's body reacts differently to
things I'm just sharing what's going on
in my body so I guess let's just start
out with the way my skin looks and then
I'll talk about the side effects and the
blood results and all that kind of stuff
I do have photos taken at the start of
accutane month to month three and now
month four so I think really the biggest
change in my skin happened in the first
two months I mean if you look at the
photo of before accutane and then month
2
it's pretty crazy I feel like in the
last few weeks I've gotten the most
amount of comments from you guys across
YouTube and on social media so sometimes
I don't really notice a big difference
but then if I see a friend that I
haven't seen in a couple weeks or I post
a new video that's not pre-recorded like
when I came back from my trip that's
when I really notice a difference
because you guys see it by the way it's
like the end of the night right now so
if my eyes are bloodshot and I'm looking
a little rough that is why it's 9 p.m.
when I'm filming this I think the
biggest difference between month 3 and
month 4 is how much the scarring has
gone down and I
think that's because of the rosehip oil
I've been using that's the only thing
I've added into my skincare routine in
the last I want to say like four weeks
five weeks and I really think is making
a difference my dermatologist pointed
out that the scarring especially on this
side has gone down a ton I definitely
still have quite a bit of redness and
scarring but it's going down I feel like
every week so that's really promising I
just put on a few drops of the rosehip
oil on top of my survey moisturizer at
night I did a whole skincare routine
video morning and nighttime what I've
been using so link that down below and
in the eye but if you're currently on
accutane I would highly recommend you
watch that video because the products
i've been using have been still working
amazing
i have a breakout right here a breakout
on my neck but these are really the only
active breakouts i've had in about the
last three to four weeks and i think
that's because I mean I've been putting
crap on my face for YouTube we did a
wish makeup video a hot look makeup
video
I've been trying tons of new products
that's probably not helping the
situation but before that I really
haven't been having any active breakouts
and obviously I have nothing on my skin
right now so you guys can really see it
I just have some settings for you and
that's what the glow is so let's move
into the side-effects and dryness like I
mentioned a month - I really didn't
experience any major dryness I think
that it is solely because of the
products I'm using even when I was gone
out in super dry winter weather all day
flying on planes for weeks I was kind of
expecting my skin get super dry and
peely and patchy and it did not the
survey just kept it moisturized my skin
type right now I would say is normal to
dry so the dryness for me has really
been not bad at all nothing at all like
I was anticipating I really was
anticipating intense intense dryness and
like bleeding lips my lips haven't been
bad either because of aquaphor camera
before I said this before in my last
video but one of my past boyfriends was
on accutane when we were together and
his lips I remember feeling so bad for
him because they were bleeding they were
literally like peeling off and he would
like code on the lip stuff that's kind
of what I was expecting
to happen I was like prepared for that
my lips and skin have not been bad so
I'm gonna take it
Thank You accutane gods
coming out a month - I mentioned I was
having eczema and that was kind of my
main side effect at that point I was
having eczema kind of on my arms and
then also mainly just on my hands and as
you can see my hands have been a lot
better especially since I've gotten back
so in the last few weeks the flight
going to Europe
my hands were almost like bleeding like
they were a very red burning peeling
Pretz my hands were so dry that they
were starting to like crack and bleed I
remember using the airport's open
Amsterdam and my hands were literally on
fire the Exim on my hands was kind of
there throughout the whole trip but then
they've been better the last few weeks
for sure like I mean it's not even
really noticeable at all a tiny tiny bit
on this one but they haven't been
burning when I wash my hands or anything
I never used a steroid cream because I
wanted to try and kind of avoid that
since it does like thin out your skin
and you're not supposed to use it for a
long time so if I can avoid something
like that I will fix that a fill cream I
was using seemed to work fine so I think
kind of my only main side effect coming
out of month 2 was my cholesterol still
going up I have high cholesterol to
start with and then accutane also can
spike your cholesterol so it's kind of
like those things doubled it was
starting to climb pretty quick after my
month three blood work my cholesterol
was still going up I think it was 243 so
in my mind the goal was kind of to do
like Mediterranean diet exercise and
then take milk thistle keep taking it
the Mediterranean diet didn't quite
happen but I have been exercising pretty
much for the last four and a half five
weeks every day that I can physically I
am working out and I still have been
taking a thousand milligrams of milk
thistle every single day so when I got
my blood work done this last time my
cholesterol is down to $1.99 and I'm
very happy about that I feel kind of
proud of myself that I could actually
get it down without some kind of like
cholesterol medication I mean I think
it's probably 99% the milk thistle is
doing but the dermatologist said just
keep doing what you're doing because
that's a good sign that it went down
that much that was my main concern going
into this month's bloodwork so it feels
really good that it's on the down I
think my main difference between month 2
and month 4 has been my insurance cost
on accutane with the new year
holy-shit sees why do I keep losing this
tweeze
you guys had more specific questions
about side effects and stuff so I'm
gonna head on to Twitter and answer some
of your tweets
okay so Shani says oh I feel like I've
answered a question for you before Shani
Shani Ramey says did you notice any
increased redness or soreness on your
face also if you don't have much of a
flexible schedule what do you still
recommend going on accutane I hear there
are a lot of lab tests and appointments
and was wondering if you could attest to
that yeah you have to do monthly
bloodwork and monthly appointments so
every single month I going to get my
blood drawn part of the whole I pledge
program when you do accutane is
committing to going in to get your blood
drawn and you have to have an
appointment every single month that's
what lets you get the next month of
pills labs open pretty early so if you
can kind of work it around your schedule
so if you have like a nine-to-five job
if you're going to school or something
you should be able to plan it around
that and then any increased redness or
soreness so that was one of the things I
forgot to talk about redness I feel like
is my main thing on my face right now my
face is definitely quite red at all
times especially when I work out I look
like a freaking tomato in the gym I
don't know if you guys can really tell
but my face is very red that is a super
common side effect of accutane soreness
not really I remember feeling it in the
first couple months I think I mentioned
that but now I really know I don't
really notice any more soreness has your
hair started getting super dry that's
something that I've noticed more in the
last month this is all tape and
extensions and they're on their last
limb too so it might be a combo of that
but I do feel like my real hair - it's a
little bit drier than usual one thing I
noticed on my hair most is dandruff I
get hella dandruff I've been using a
dove dandruff shampoo don't really know
if it's doing anything yet I've only
used it a couple times if you wanted to
you could literally go weeks without
washing your hair on accutane my hair
literally does not produce oil well you
still have dry skin after you stop
taking it or does it kind of level out I
can't predict the future but I have a
feeling that it'll kind of level out
since it already is in the last month
it's kind of leveling it out there are a
few questions about what has it affected
me emotionally at all depression
suicidal thoughts any of that kind of
stuff so for me I haven't experienced
that at all which I am very thankful for
my mood has been
and great just been normal but I know
that is a major thing for a lot of
people so just be aware if you're
someone that does have tendencies or you
have depression your family that that
could happen Tiffany says has having
clear skin giving you more confidence I
think what I have now is a different
feeling it's almost more of a free
feeling like I feel like I can literally
just walk outside acne isn't the center
of all of your thoughts when I have to
go run and get post mates outside like
get the delivery guy at the door I'm not
thinking of brushing on concealer really
quick or if I'm going to the grocery
store to pick up one thing I don't feel
like I really need to do anything it's
just a freeing feeling knowing that you
don't really have to worry as much about
your skin I think that's been the
biggest difference for me it's a it's a
great feeling
it really is also it's just a wild
feeling having something actually work
for the first time like if you wash my
acne story video you know how many
things I've tried over the years and if
you have acne you know that you can go
from pill to pill to pill and I think
also just with my other health stuff I
never have a pill that does what it's
supposed to do and actually helps so
it's just been a really nice feeling
having a medication do what it's
supposed to do and make you feel good
like feel better I never experienced
that I think that's where more of just
like the mental change comes in for me I
felt confident before I feel confident
now I felt beautiful before I feel
beautiful now and if you're where I was
four months ago know that you're still
beautiful and something is gonna work
whether it's accutane or something else
do you just have to keep trying and
something will eventually click and
something will work for your body how
are you treating the red marks and
scarring was a frequently asked question
like I said rosehip oil that's really
all I've been doing and I think it's
helping I'm gonna keep using it this is
a cute question Daniella says what's the
most positive experience that has
happened since accutane love your
channel and you burrito for life it
actually happened pretty recently I
tweeted it and I was going through
comments keep in mind like I'm used to
scrolling through comments for years
and at least one of them every time I
check it has something to do with how
horrible my skin is how I'm doing
everything wrong how I don't wash my
face you know all of that kind of stuff
every day there's some kind of comment
like that but I was rolling through
Commons and I saw a comment from someone
that said I want your skin and I
literally have never heard those words
and on one hand it's like don't say that
like I said everyone's skin is beautiful
I truly believe that but I also had just
literally never heard those words that
was just like a moment for me and for
some reason it was different than things
like my parents and friends in real life
and everything have said that one for
some reason just like clicked and I feel
like I'll always remember that feeling
Julie says have you noticed anything
unusual like thinning skin to other
areas of your body not at all I don't
even know how you tell if your skin is
thinning I think my skin is thick Renee
says has accutane bothered your stomach
at all I have had nausea and stuff every
now and then and throwing up I already
have kind of a weird like I'll get
nauseous randomly at like 2:00 a.m. and
throw up sometimes so I don't know if
it's gotten any worse I don't feel like
it has but again everyone's body is
different Hannah says can you tell me
now if you think you'll be good to go in
the regular six months or do you think
your dermatologist will extend your dose
I don't know she didn't really say
anything at this point but she said for
going into month four am I going to
month four month five going into month
five my skin is looking where she wants
it to be for going into month five
Lissa's have you noticed any problems
with night sweats I'm on month two and
that has been my mouth why is my mouth
not up to speed right now I'm on month
two and the husband my most annoying
side-effect besides the dryness oh by
the way I'm on 60 milligrams that was
something I forgot I think to say in LA
so now I'm on 60 milligrams so I do 30
twice a day I have not experienced night
sweats I am friggin freezing all the
time but I was like that before so I
don't think that has anything to do with
that game so Zoey says would you say in
your personal experience that it's worth
the side effects so that's something
that is I feel like so personal to
everyone because some people have very
very scary side effects very hellish
experience
is anxiety depression there are some
serious side effects just my experience
for myself I would do it again 150
percent my side effects I feel like have
been very minimal so that's been really
surprising to me too because like I said
I'm not 1% of people who will get
something weird
bilenda says what's been the hardest
most frustrating aspect of accutane is
that the dryness the restrictions
getting lapsed and all the time for me
it honestly hasn't been that much of a
lifestyle switch besides just what I'm
doing for the cholesterol I already get
major body pain so the joint and muscle
pain from accutane I do have but it's
just I'm used to pain every day so it's
not a big like lifestyle change for me
to be dealing with something like that I
already don't drink a whole lot so that
hasn't really been an issue for me
you're not really supposed to drink on a
keychain because of the liver Maria says
have your migraines increased or got
worse during accutane I would say
they've stayed about the same
Brittany says we have another process
done when you complete the treatment to
help with scarring basically I'm gonna
see where my skin's at the end with the
scarring and stuff but I definitely
wouldn't be opposed to doing some kind
of treatment like why can't I think of
the name over right now needle needle
literally can't think of the name I'm
not opposed to doing something like that
or laser to help with the scarring
afterwards but I'm pretty sure you have
to wait awhile before you can do
anything like that pressure you have to
wait like six months or a year before
you can do any kind of laser treatment
or anything on your skin anywhere like I
want to get my whole body lasered they
just finally came out with a blonde hair
laser so that's pretty much everything
I'm gonna keep taking my milk thistle
I've still been drinking a ton of water
I think that is something that's also
made really helped with the redness with
not the redness with the dryness I'm
just crossing my fingers that it stays
like this for the last couple months
that would be phenomenal and instead
phenomenal in like four years before we
wrap this up I'm gonna zoom you guys in
I turned down the lights so you can
really see everything especially with
this new lens I just want you guys to be
able to see my scarring and the skin and
everything so I hope you guys enjoyed
