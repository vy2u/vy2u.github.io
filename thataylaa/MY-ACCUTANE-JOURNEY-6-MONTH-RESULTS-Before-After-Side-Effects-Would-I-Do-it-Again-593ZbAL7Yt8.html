last accutane update so wild I can't
believe it's been six months so if
you're new here I've been on accutane
for six months I was on 60 milligrams I
did updates every couple months so I do
have a playlist down below that a link
that has all of my acne related videos I
have a whole acne story before I started
accutane so you can see where I was
coming from what I've tried in the past
my skin history and what my skin looked
like back then so if you're just
stumbling across this video I would
definitely go check out my acne story
video first and then you can kind of go
through and see the progress and there's
other update videos but this is my last
one I'm now off of accutane I've been
off of accutane for about a week when
I'm filming this I've done my last blood
test so I'm gonna kind of walk through
everything buttocks I'm using on my skin
now to help with scarring I'm gonna show
you the progress photos over the last
six months and also answering all of
your questions from Twitter so if you're
excited for this video don't forget to
give it a thumbs up if you're new here
you can join the burrito family and
subscribe I upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time
this also isn't gonna be my last
accutane related video I have a couple
other ideas of things that I want to do
just surrounding the topic of accutane
and acne in general so those videos will
be coming but all of my acne related
videos are down below in that playlist
gotta throw this out there like I doing
every single accutane video accutane is
a very serious drug you're not just
gonna get on accutane if you have a
couple zits
accutane is the last resort kind of drug
if you've been suffering for acne for a
long period of time and you've tried
multiple things i didn't take this
decision lightly to go on accutane
neither should you you should do your
own research figure out if it's
something that's right for your body and
your health so I'm not advocating for
accutane I'm just sharing my experience
let's just get into it it's actually
held early right now what time is it
it's 749 on a Sunday I've been up since
6:20 already got Starbucks I don't know
why I'm so alive right now so right now
I am off accutane I've been off for
about a week I've done my last blood
test all I have to do is go back in a
month and pee in a cup to get a
pregnancy test so first off here's my
skin keep in mind that this lighting is
a bit more flattering so I did get a
clip in natural lighting because I
wanted you guys to be able to see here's
a clip of natural lighting my acne is
completely gone nothing is on my skin
right now all I have on is a face
moisturizer no makeup no concealer
nothing but I'm gonna insert some
progress photos right here I don't think
I can fit all of them on one screen but
I'm gonna show you before starting
accutane and then a couple shots in
between I think it was in the last
check-in where I was still getting like
a zit every now and then just every like
few weeks like one little zit and I
don't think I've had a zit in a couple
months like since I last told you guys
my two main things are acne scarring and
redness but redness has actually I feel
like you've been gone down since I've
been off it and the dermatologist said
it would take a few weeks for the
redness to go away but accutane does
give you a majorly red face sometimes
and that definitely happened to me that
was kind of throughout the whole thing
but I feel like it's gone down a lot
since being off it in a week when I go
outside and like I said it looks better
in this lighting but when I go outside
my face is actually quite a bit like
darker almost like more tan than my neck
which is weird it almost looks like have
like a self-tanner on not a big deal at
all this scarring since the last
check-in I feel like has gone down a lot
and the dermatologist noticed that too I
was actually talking to her about
treatments and stuff which I'll talk
about cuz that was one of the questions
for me guys but we're talking about
different skin treatments to try and she
actually said she doesn't recommend
micro needling for me or anything like
that because my scarring isn't that bad
like it's actually faded a lot and I
tribute that solely to rosehip oil I've
mentioned this in the last few update
videos I swear by this thing I've been
using this for how long now maybe four
months three months at least three
months and this has majorly helped my
scarring so if you have acne scarring
this is super affordable I want to say
it's around ten bucks if this a couple
months to really work its magic and do
its thing I talk more about the products
that I'm using now towards the end of
this video so the results from my last
blood test came back totally normal my
cholesterol was still a little bit high
but like I've said my cholesterol is
high to start with so it wasn't up to
the highest point which i think was what
was it to 40 to 46 or something then it
came back down things to milk thistle
exercise and eating healthier and I've
been still doing all those things so I
think a combo of all of that has helped
everything else on the blood tests came
back totally good we're good to go I
think I'm actually just gonna go into
the questions because it'll just help
sum up all my thoughts you know
okay so Daniella says on a scale of 1 to
10 how happy are you with your results
honestly I feel like I'm like an 11 I I
don't know what I thought I was
expecting I guess said in the first
video I actually watched my acne story
back the other night which is really
trippy not only to see my skin but to
just like see where I was at with the
whole thing and I think I said I was
going into it hoping for the best but
being ready for the worst because that's
been my experience with medication I'm
on a lot of medications for chronic pain
and everything and I just have never had
a medication actually work like this so
I think that's just been like the
coolest thing for me but as far as my
results and everything I don't know if I
was expecting to like totally have my
acne cleared since I was going into it
with that mindset where I was just kind
of like almost ready for it not to work
because that's easier to go into
something not having your hopes like up
here you know I'm saying I kind of was
just like okay we're gonna try this if
it works it works if not I have acne I
think going into it that mindset kind of
helped because now I'm just not only
shocked with the results but I just I
don't think I've ever seen my skin like
this last time I saw my skin like this I
think was before I was even a teenager
it just feels so nice to like kill my
skin and feel good about my skin Vanessa
says were you afraid of the side effects
that can possibly happen with the
process yeah I for sure was like I said
I kind of was ready for the worst there
are some horrible side effects from
accutane which is why again don't just
watch my videos and go on accutane is a
drug they need to do research on there
are very serious mental health side
effects to it there are a lot of
horrible side effects to Accutane I am
super grateful because I feel like I had
such an easy overall accutane experience
which again I was not expecting as far
as side-effects it's basically just all
the ones that you have heard already
nothing has changed in the last two
months since my last update eczema
dryness redness and then joint pain my
joint pain I do feel has gotten worse in
the last six months for sure I didn't
have a lot of back pain before accutane
and now I definitely do I actually have
quite a bit of back pain but as someone
who wakes up every morning feeling
shitty anyways from other health stuff
it hasn't really impacted my life in a
way that I think it could if you don't
have that to start with so basically I
just have more pain but it is supposed
to kind of get better and go away as you
get off the pill so
not super concerned about it do I get
more sore after our workout for sure do
I have more overall pain for sure do I
feel like sometimes I'm 90 years old yes
it's not like a deal breaker to me where
I wouldn't do it again
Cassie asked an interesting question she
said what will you miss most from
accutane I will miss not having to wash
my hair for a few days saves a ton saves
a ton of time what will I miss most
about accutane I think what I'm gonna
miss is just having the assurance I
guess that as you're taking the pill
your acne isn't gonna come back and now
that I've stopped taking the pill
obviously there's that wondering if it's
gonna come back and a bunch of you guys
asked that question is is my acne gonna
come back once I'm off accutane I can't
see into the future so I have no idea
hopefully not obviously but some people
do have to go and accutane two times
three times I don't think you can go on
acting more than three times your body
would be like destroyed I'm just
crossing my fingers that I won't have to
go and accutane a second time that my
skin will just stay like this my mom was
also in accutane in our 20s and she only
had to do it one time and her acne just
completely stayed away and that's the
case for most people a lot of people do
have to go on a second time but I'm just
hoping that I won't have to and my acne
will stay away so I have no idea if it's
gonna come back hopefully it won't other
than that I don't think I'm gonna miss
anything
Taylor says all in all was it worth it
do the pros outweigh the cons I'm
seriously debating going on it I'm
almost 25 with brutal acne and scarring
and like you have tried everything I
don't even like leaving my house but
speaking from my own personal experience
for me it was a hundred and fifty
percent worth it I would do it again in
a second but that's just speaking from
my experience with it in my side effects
a lot of people go in accutane have
horrible side effects and I'm sure they
wouldn't say the same thing I was coming
from being in my mid-20s with severe
acne for ten years yes I would totally
do it again America says when did you
really start noticing a difference in
your skin I've been on it for three
months and I still breakout I feel like
my progress is so slow that something
that's totally different for everyone I
think if you go back to my first update
video I think I said within like a
couple weeks my skin started clearing up
take everything I say with a grain of
salt because I really feel like I had
the best possible accutane experience I
didn't have a purge phase which is where
your skin gets worse before it gets
better
I felt like mine started clearing up
within the first couple weeks and then
it just kind of progressively got better
from there but I do know that a lot of
people
takes a couple months or even three
months before you start seeing your
hacking clear up so I wouldn't like
totally discount it hopefully you'll see
results another question from Daniella
she says is accutane considered a
cosmetic medication does insurance cover
any part of it
so it just depends on your insurance I'm
pretty sure but my insurance did cover
part of it but when I hit the new year
it went way up so I pay a lot out of
pocket for accutane but again for me
it's worth it especially if you just
think about how many skin care products
you've purchased over the years how many
acne medications you purchased over the
years it all adds up and so to do this
one time it totally makes sense if you
have the money available hopefully your
insurance will cover more than minded
okay Shelby says are you nervous about
your skin going back to normal after
accutane acne an oily skin that's one of
my biggest fears being on accutane
myself right now
there were a lot of questions like this
about is my skin gonna go back to oily
my skin has been obviously super dry for
the last six months I didn't have really
really bad dryness and I solely
attribute that to the products I'm using
I have a whole video on my accutane
skincare routine so if you want to know
every single product that I've been
using throughout this process and I
still use those products and I still
110% recommend them like I said don't
know the future so I have no idea if my
skin is gonna be normal if it's gonna
stay dry it's gonna go back to oily but
if I could choose I would definitely
have dry skin makeup is so much easier
with dry skin than it is with oily skin
it stays on your face I kind of want to
do a video talking about like the pros
and cons are just different tips and
things that I've found with oily skin
versus dry skin now that I've had both
megan says why did he stop accutane the
first time and do you feel confident
stopping it now so this is my first time
I've never been on accutane before I
didn't I didn't go on it and stop I just
never did it I've been to different
dermatologists in the past about
accutane like getting consultations and
I just never went through with it
because I felt like it wasn't the right
time I was either traveling a lot I
couldn't commit to the monthly blood
tests it was summer there was just a lot
of things going on I just finally did it
this time because it was the right
season of the year because accutane
makes your skin so sensitive in the Sun
if I was doing it again or recommending
like timing for someone who's doing it I
would say start when I did I actually
think that was perfect timing I started
in October and I
finished I would definitely not want to
do accutane during the middle of summers
you can get fried on accutane because
your skin is so much more sensitive to
the Sun and it's just gonna be so much
more uncomfortable and stuff so if you
can time it so you don't hit it during
summer oh definitely do that yes this is
my first time never been on accutane
before hopefully my only time
dextra says wondering how you deal with
red skin issues I very red cheeks and no
idea what to do about it so it just kind
of depends on like the makeup look I'm
doing obviously if I'm doing my full on
makeup I usually use kind of a fuller
coverage foundation cuz that's just what
I like but if I'm just running errands
I'll usually just put on some kind of
like tinted moisturizer because I don't
want it to look like I'm wearing makeup
I just want the redness tone down so I
usually use something like the jus a
skin tint or I'll just use any
foundation and just put on the tiniest
bit and put a little bit on my hands
I'll even maybe sometimes put a little
oil in there and just kind of like blend
it over my redness so it doesn't look
like I have makeup on and I'm using like
the tiniest amount but I can still cover
the redness so that's kind of what I've
been doing if I just want to cover it
but I don't want to put on I should ton
of makeup Haley says what's the first
thing that you're going to do that you
couldn't do well on it I'm about to go
out and celebrate can't find it now but
there was also a question about drinking
if I was drinking on accutane since
accutane can be really rough on your
liver the milk thistle helps a lot so if
you are planning on drinking check with
your pharmacist and stuff don't just go
buy milk thistle but for me I feel like
that really helped I don't drink a lot
to start if I do drink I literally
usually have about one drink because it
makes my head so much worse I'm not a
big drinker so it wasn't like too rough
or anything but it is nice now being
able to go out and if I want to have a
night you know what I'm saying I don't
have to worry about it and I can just do
it
Macey says was it worth it and how do
you feel about yourself now versus six
months ago there was a lot of questions
about this just self confidence and just
how has my whole I guess mine said about
my skin changed in the last six months I
talked about this a lot in the last
update video but I just had acne for so
long that I got so used to it and I feel
like I got to a point where it didn't
really affect my confidence a whole lot
because I just it was my skin and it was
who I was for so long that you just have
one choice and that's to live with it
and to embrace it you know but I did not
realize how bad it was because I just
got so used to seeing myself like that
so now looking back on old footage
it just kind of hits yeah it's just
insane to see I didn't realize how bad
my skin was I think it just overall
feels good that a obviously I don't have
acne on my face anymore but also be it's
just not a topic of conversation anymore
in my life for years it has been with my
family with random people with strangers
on the internet with everything so it
just feels really good that that's not
one of the first things people see when
they look at you and I feel my age now
which is a weird thing to say but I feel
like having acne in your mid-20s is a
really weird experience because people I
think just associate having bad acne to
like being a teenager and stuff and now
that my skin is more clear I just feel I
don't know I just feel more myself ooh
Thank You Katherine good thing to bring
up she says did you experience any dry
eyes and how did you deal with it that's
actually my biggest change I would
totally forgot to mention this between
the four months and six months my last
update my dry eyes have gotten a lot
worse probably putting eye drops about
three times a day now link the eye drops
that used down below which really helped
but also my eyes get really really red
since I've been off at they've already
been getting a little bit better is
there anything you would do differently
to prepare your skin for the process I
actually think the products I ended up
using throughout this thing just worked
amazing for my skin you're starting
accutane I would definitely say
moisturize the crap out of your skin and
your lips and everything before you
actually start because I feel like that
made a huge difference and I feel like
that's one of the reasons why I didn't
get super super dry aquaphor healing
ointment in the tube it's in that video
but that has been a lifesaver I use that
literally about ten times a day that's a
nice segue into what I'm using right now
so I'm using all the same products and
now that I'm off accutane I have been so
into skin care okay wait so products and
then treatments and stuff so my
dermatologist actually said that I could
do any kind of treatments pretty much a
week after which I was shocked I
literally thought it was gonna be six
months because that's what I've read and
she said there have been new studies
coming out that you don't have to wait
six months at all you can just wait
about a week or two obviously depending
on your skin I've noticed that my skin
actually is totally fine with like a
chaise and be a chaise I started using
those on the last week on accutane I did
that she masked like you guys on the
whole foods video I also use another
a couple times and my skin felt totally
fine it didn't feel overly sensitive or
anything but as far as getting my
permanent brows touched up I thought I
was gonna have to wait six months for
that and she said I don't so I'm just
waiting until July when I'm back in San
Diego and I'm gonna do my brow touch-up
then but as far as any kind of laser
treatments I want to get my whole body
lasered like I want hair removal so she
said I don't have to wait a long time
for that facials anything she said it's
like free-for-all right now so okay
since being off accutane I'm slowly
incorporating different kinds of AJ's be
a chaise lactic acids into my skincare
routine just to help smooth everything
get rid of texture get rid of the
scarring brighten up my complexion so a
few things I've been using so this one I
showed in a blog the drunk elephant TLC
Sakaki baby facial I liked this one I
did feel like it made my skin stop it
has 25% H a 2% pH a it's just a
treatment so you leave it on for 10
minutes wash it off 10 minutes or 20
minutes 20 minutes this one's 20 minutes
this one by the ordinary again is 30% H
a so tiny bit stronger and it has 2% DHA
and this is a 10 minute exfoliating
facial it's called basically both these
are like chemical peels and this one I
loved I feel like I actually noticed
more of a difference with this one than
I did with the drunk elephant one I
showed it on snapchat but my skin had
that like glassy look to it just looked
like so tight and smooth but both works
great just depending on what your budget
and everything this one is definitely
under 15 bucks this one is like really
expensive I think this is 80 bucks or
something around there I'm also been
starting to use this PC a skin smoothing
toner this is a brand that a lot of
dermatologists carry I actually was on
derm store and I was just reading a ton
of reviews on different products and
this one got really good reviews this is
a lactic acid so it does give you that
burn at the beginning but I've just been
slowly starting to incorporate these
things into my skincare routine once I
have a routine that I really like and
then I feel like I've seen a difference
with after a couple months I'll do a
video on it but I'm just like in the
beginning stages of trying those right
now so I just wanted to mention them oh
wait my eczema has been a lot better
thanks to a recommendation from you guys
the first day Beauty ultra Repair Cream
in a tub I've been using it on my face
I've been using on my body
I'll talk all about it in upcoming rays
and rejects video that is like my Holy
Grail body moisturizer of the past
couple months it
has just totally gotten rid of my eczema
it honestly is like an eczema miracle
worker
I haven't had to use the steroid cream
at all from the dermatologist I actually
didn't use that at all throughout my
entire accutane so I think that's
everything I think this wraps up my
accutane update videos if you've enjoyed
this whole accutane series and found it
helpful don't forget to give this video
a thumbs up I really appreciate it and I
just want to say I really appreciate all
of your comments messages everything
last six months I've just felt
overwhelming support from you guys and I
just think it's so cool that a lot of
you have been with me throughout the
entire thing with my older videos and
then up until now it's just so cool to
know that some of you guys have been
there with me throughout the whole thing
so if you're going on accutane I hope
you have a healthy and positive
experience again do your own research
watch tons of videos don't just watch
mine do some googling talk to your
dermatologist talk to your pharmacist
but I love you guys thanks for watching
see my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
