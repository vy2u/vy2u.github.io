bro come on I'm in the zone here
all right so today we're gonna be
talking all about acne fun topics this
is gonna be basically my comprehensive
video of my history what I've tried what
has worked what hasn't worked pretty
much everything over the last seven to
ten years that has ultimately led me to
the decision to go on accutane so and
I'm filming this it's October 11th 2017
I start accutane tomorrow I've gone
through the whole process approvable
everything we'll talk more about that
towards the end of the video this isn't
gonna be a video focused on accutane
because I'm gonna be having more of us
coming kind of documenting the process
my journey with it and before and afters
and all of that firstly just want to
have a video to really talk about
everything because I get so many
questions about what I'm doing for my
skin people telling me to go see a
dermatologist drink more water you know
all the lovely comments
I'm at the point where I've been on
YouTube for six years now I've heard
pretty much everything in regards to my
skin and I found confidence in my skin
over the years I have a whole video on
it if you're struggling with skin
confidence I'll link it in the I over
here and I'll put it down below too but
I'm at a place where I'm comfortable
with my skin in the sense that I am
confident enough to go outside with acne
it doesn't affect my self-confidence I
am very aware that there's acne on my
face I'm sure you guys experience it too
on a certain degree in your lives from
friends and family or just random people
who sometimes feel the need to comment
on your skin think even when you might
want to say something or you're
frustrated or you've heard the same
thing 5,000 times go high most people
are just trying to help they don't
realize how many times you've probably
heard the same thing or how you're
feeling so if you are that person on the
other end and you don't have acne just
be aware that the friend or stranger or
whoever it is who does have acne it
might not be your place to say something
if you do choose to say something make
sure it's in a constructive kind way
acne can be a serious self-confidence
kicker for some people can kind of be
like a gateway to other kind of serious
mental health issues like depression so
even though it might just seem like
superficial or whatever to some people
it really affects certain people so just
be aware of that just be nice to people
I think is the world's a story so this
video is gonna be very detailed probably
gonna be how long get comfortable chill
here's how this is gonna go so I'm start
with my history but I'm gonna move into
what I've tried and then wrap it up with
now which is going on acting I want to
say a disclaimer don't fast-forward
through this because I actually feel
like it's important this is my body just
like this is my body anything that you
do with your body is your choice by
making these acne videos I'm not
encouraging that you go in accutane I'm
simply sharing my experience in hopes
that hopefully it helps someone out
there whether it's just realizing that
acne is normal I hope that you can still
feel beautiful I hope that it doesn't
impact your life in a way that I know it
does for a lot of people you will get
rid of acne at some point do your own
research be proactive about trying to
get rid of your acne with what works for
your body everyone's bodies are so
different I've
so much research on skin and acne and
diet and your gut and all this stuff
over the area's hormones I mean it's
crazy it really is true that while there
are some obviously main things that you
can do to try and get rid of your acne
and that helps a bunch of people it
doesn't mean that it's gonna work for
everyone
accutane is a very serious drug with
serious side effects
accutane for me is a last resort I'm
making these videos I'm not trying to
promote it I'm literally just sharing my
experience I know that when I was
debating going on accutane YouTube was
definitely one of the places I went to
see other people's experiences and just
learn about kind of what they're going
through and if it worked for them so I
hope that my videos throughout this
whole six months helped some of you guys
do the same thing alright so let's get
started this is gonna be an hour-long
video I can already tell by the way
clearly not wearing any face makeup
right now so you can see what my skin
looks like I have tons of videos showing
you guys my skin so you can pretty much
go back the past few years as long as
I've been on YouTube and see what state
my skin was in by the way I'm trying out
a different lens today and it's like a
much more wide angle so the camera is
actually sitting on my table right now
which feels really good it feels like
much more chill than having the monitor
and the camera five million miles away I
probably won't film makeup videos like
this but for just like chatty ones I
kind of like it let me know what you
guys think you probably don't even
notice the difference okay so the
history of my acne so to get all the
facts straight for this I talked to my
parents I looked back on previous videos
I look back on all the medications I
took I have notes here so for those of
you who don't know I'm 25 years old so I
technically have adult cystic acne but
I've actually had acne since high school
so 2006 to 2010 is when I started
getting acne I would say it was more so
just like whiteheads and zits here and
there kind of typical teenage acne you
are not about to mow the lawn right now
bro
come on I'm in the zone here so high
school had usual hormonal teenage
breakouts here and there but it was to
the point where my parents took me to
the dermatologists lol at all the
comments saying go to a dermatologist
bro I've been going to dermatologists
since I was literally 13 years old they
did put me on an oral pill in high
school I was also using a topical gel I
tried different face washes ones from
the dermatologists ones just from the
drugstore whatever and I did help in
high school kind of the theme of my acne
over the last I'm gonna say ten years I
really have had cystic acne for its
intense closer to five which is still
very long time but acne has been in and
out of my life for ten years and that's
pretty much kind of the recurring theme
of my skin history is that it always for
again comes back if you look at my
videos I've definitely had about six to
eight month periods where my skin is
clear and I was looking through the
videos I wrote down in 2015 it was about
a six month period where my skin was
looking good like I still had scarring
and stuff but I did not have cystic acne
so there have been phases where my skin
has been clear it just always comes back
so anyways rewind graduated high school
in 2010 freshman year of college my skin
started to get worse it wasn't horrible
at that point I didn't have like cystic
acne but my acne definitely started
coming back I wasn't making videos then
I started making videos sophomore year
of college so I don't have any videos to
like document that time but I just start
getting some acne here and there
sophomore year it got worse junior year
so 2013 is when my skin got horrible so
that's when I was actually living abroad
I'm sure that has something to do with
that just being in a different
environment different food different
dairy all those factors obviously
contribute to your skin when I was doing
research thought it was super
interesting eighty one percent is
actually genetic and only 19 percent is
attributed to environmental factors like
stress diet makeup all that kind of
stuff so if acne runs in your family
you definitely have an increased
propensity to develop acne so I
definitely got that from my mom my mom
had cystic acne in her 20s hello
and she also actually went on accutane
when she was 25 I believe maybe 24 so I
want to say I've actually gone to
at least for probably five different
dermatologists over the years I think a
super common misconception either if you
see someone on the street or one of your
friends have acne or whatever is that
they're not doing anything they don't
wash their face they haven't gone to a
dermatologist and obviously I'm not
speaking for everyone but most people
when you have acne you kind of want to
try things to get rid of it you're not
usually just chillin not washing your
face enjoying your acne over here I know
for myself over the years I feel like
I've tried pretty much everything and
that's what we're gonna jump into next
so I'm not a dermatologist I'm just
sharing some of the things that I've
read and I've learned over the years but
there are actually over 50 types of
different acne for a while I thought
mine was hormonal because of the
placement typically hormonal acne is
like your chin down your neck usually I
don't get it on my forehead I happen to
have it on my forehead when I told me
this video but if you guys watch my
videos you know that typically my acne
is down here and has been for the years
I actually got a blood test to test for
other things having to do with other
health issues but hormone levels were
one of the things that they tested for
and my hormone levels were completely
fine I don't have PCOS my hormone levels
have been tested they're normal one of
the many wonders of life I'm just gonna
try and throw out everything I can think
of that I've tried in the quickest way
possible and kind of touch on a few of
them so there are obviously medications
and then there are more natural remedies
you can do there are diet changes there
are you know workout exercise drink
water workout exercise are the same
thing if you're someone who has severe
intense acne you know that when you go
to a dermatologist there are definitely
certain things that most of them try
certain steps before accutane so I
pretty much tried all those birth
control is a big one I've been on
multiple probably five or six different
birth control pills more than that over
the years but I should say that while I
was in Jordan living abroad when my acne
got really bad I actually stopped birth
control I thought probably also had
something to do with it I got back on it
when I was here I've been back on and
off for years since I'm currently on
birth control and it clearly hasn't
helped my skin but for a lot of people
birth control is actually really
effective I'm not going to name every
single medication that I've ever tried
but pretty much any of the
biotics doxycycline mono cyclin might be
butchering these names birth control
cure ology which helped but then it came
back proactive also helped but then it
came back I've actually been on Proactiv
twice once in high school once in
college senior year
yeah those senior year Sparano lactone
that when I had a reaction with my
migraine medication hazarat cream
different blood test hormone levels
checked food allergy tests and then some
of the more natural stuff I've tried
witch hazel tea tree oil diet changes
probiotics there's a lot of information
on how your gut affects acne so
probiotics can help a lot of people
clear their skin I'm still on probiotics
and I'm going to keep taking them
because they're just good in general for
you different teas green tea different
anti-inflammatory teas african black
soap african clay mask vitamin c serum
there are so many products you guys i've
tried over the years you saw my bathroom
right now and including all the products
like I've gotten rid of over the years
I've definitely tried over a hundred
products specifically for my acne and
there are definitely certain products
that have helped and if you watch my
past skincare routine videos or I have
one like how I got rid of my acne video
because my acne was gone like I said for
a six-month period and then it came back
but there are definitely things that
have helped my skin none of them have
been a permanent fix so the products I
mentioned in the how I cleared my skin
video which I'll link down below I still
recommend those because it did help my
skin if I can think of one product that
I feel like has made the biggest
difference in my skin over the years is
the Olay Henriksen invigorating night
treatment it's in like the green bottle
you can get at Sephora it is pricey but
for me like I'm willing to pay anything
at this point having acne for so long I
basically have learned what my skin
reacts better to like I know for a fact
self so if acid typically works better
at then benzoyl peroxide benzoyl
peroxide doesn't do shit for me I feel
like it actually makes my skin worse
sometimes
makeup is tricky for me because clearly
my job is not conventional most people
whether you have acne or not are not
testing out tons of products every
single week so I'm sure that hasn't
helped my skin primer is one of the
things I found is like the biggest
trigger for me certain primers a hundred
percent break out my skin horribly
certain foundations break up my skin
horribly but I think the overall thing
to note here is
even when I've gone weeks without
wearing a single product on my face
if I am traveling I usually don't wear
foundation especially in the last year
is when I've really stopped wearing
foundation to like go out to the grocery
store I used to always wear some kind of
foundation or concealer or something to
go out I'll still put on like spot
concealer down on my neck and stuff if
I'm gonna be you know running to the
grocery store or something but I don't
wear a full-on foundation so there's
definitely been periods over the last
year especially where I've given my skin
a major break and my skin is still bad I
do think obviously certain products
making my skin worse but it's not like
the sole cause of my acne so it's just
kind of like trial and error along with
everything else so I hope I kind of
accurately depicted for you guys what I
have tried over the years so you know
I'm not just randomly deciding to go in
accutane so again just in case any of
you didn't listen to the disclaimer at
the beginning or fast-forward it through
it and you're now somehow like twenty
minutes into the video wrapper we're at
I'm not encouraging
accutane accutane again is a very
serious drug I am just sharing why I am
going on it so today is October 11th I
had my dermatologist appointment this
morning where I officially got 100%
approved I get the pills tomorrow and I
start tomorrow there's a whole process
that you have to do before going on
accutane but my kind of one word of
advice at this point is that the only
reason why I'm aware of some of the very
serious side effects and permanent side
effects from accutane is because of the
interweb because of youtube because of
you guys in the comments my
dermatologist actually both
dermatologists I've gone to about this
have kind of played it down which if
you're a dermatologist if you're a
doctor I don't want to you know make
this like blanket statement about all
doctors but sometimes they play stuff
down a little bit and it's good to just
have your own opinions and do your own
research on stuff and just be aware of
what could happen I'm aware of the
serious side effects at this point in
something that I'm willing to try
especially since my mom went on it and
had such good results with it she hasn't
had acne since I'm just kind of going in
with the positive mindset and hoping
that I'm not one of those people that
gets the very serious side effects but I
am gonna be documenting my entire
accutane journey so I think I'm going to
kind of play
year and see how regularly I want to do
updates I don't think it'll be a monthly
thing I'll probably do every two months
maybe every month if I'm seeing like big
changes but basically I'm on a six-month
60 milligram dose but I'm starting at 30
milligrams for the first month she said
that some people still get the purge
phase some people don't get the purge
phase either way my skin is probably
gonna be super sensitive very dry pili
kind of the normal accutane side effects
so I can set in a foundation Friday a
couple weeks ago where I talked about
accutane I do have about seven weeks
worth of foundation Friday videos
pre-recorded so every single video that
you guys are gonna be saying through
things like the third week in November
is gonna be a pre-recorded foundation
Friday video not my other videos just
the Friday videos just because I don't
know what my skin is gonna be like I
don't know if I'm gonna want to put
makeup on at all who knows it's not
everything I feel like I'm forgetting a
like a major chunk of information I
needed to share oh I know what I also
wanted to say I know a lot of you guys
watch my foundation videos because of
acne and trying to find ways to cover it
and just foundations that work well with
acne and texture and everything and I'm
definitely still gonna have scarring
after I'm on accutane obviously there's
gonna be something that I try and fix my
ideal would be not having to wear
foundation or wearing like a very light
foundation I think as I've gotten older
especially in the last year I've been
really enjoying just feeling my face so
I'm excited I you know I'm going into
this hoping for the best but at the same
time being prepared if my body reacts
not in the best way to accutane but I
just finally got to the point where I
feel like I've tried a lot I am in my
mid-20s and I'm ready for this acne to
be gone I feel prepared mentally
physically and I'm excited and I'm
excited that you guys are on this
journey with me hopefully I will be acne
free in six months so if you want to
follow along the accutane journey I'm
gonna put this video in a playlist along
with the other accutane videos as I make
them also gonna have my foundation
videos linked down below my other acne
