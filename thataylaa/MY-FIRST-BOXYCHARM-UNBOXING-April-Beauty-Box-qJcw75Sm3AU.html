my room literally looks like a moving
truck just like shot all over the place
I'm using natural lighting right now not
my ring light so let me know what you
guys think here in the I bow I'm also
using my old lens because again I still
can't figure out how to get that thing
in focus on autofocus without making
noise during the video I've tried the
mic I'm just seriously struggling that
perfume bottle head is bothering me I'm
super stoked for today's video because
we are going to be unboxing my first
boxycharm ever actually tweeted you guys
I think that was like a month ago now
asking what your thoughts are on
boxycharm
and a lot of you guys had really great
things to say so I thought I'd check it
out by the way on my lips right now is
Jake at Beauty Wonder lip paint I'm
trying this out haven't used it before I
think they're supposed to be like the
lip tars Oh in the summer tooth a change
in the part boxycharm so boxycharm is a
box this guys $21 and you get over $100
with the product which is awesome it's
not sample sizes they're complete either
full or deluxe sized samples which I
really like because there's something
most samples I just feel like I rarely
actually use them got my scissors let's
do this these scissors I probably get
more questions about than anything these
are just gold scissors from Amazon that
I can link them down below if you want
to buy them they're really nice they're
super sharp so you have to be careful
but they definitely add a little pizzazz
to your Instagram photos yeah I'm saying
so this is what the inside of the box
looks like there's a little card on top
what sort of it so has a list of all the
products and the prices I've seen a lot
of boxycharm videos lately but I haven't
watched any because I wanted to be
surprised with what's in my box oh whoa
what the heck okay so the first thing I
see is there's a revealed 2 palette in
here which is awesome so already this
basically covers the price of the box
you guys know this is one of my favorite
palettes ever I'm going to be having a
huge giveaway coming up when I hit a
hundred thousand which is just insane to
me but we'll talk about that in a later
video but I'm kind of like saving stuff
here and there for that giveaway so I'm
gonna put this in here so you guys can
have a chance to win this palette this
is probably actually my like most used I
shadow palette I used to wear eyeshadow
every single day
and I'm just kind of stopped since work
because it's just not something I feel
like I have to wear when I was in my
eyeshadow phase I literally wore this
thing like every day I have a full
review on this which I'll link over here
of a couple shadow his videos using this
palette as well yeah that's awesome
okay this is exciting this is the Oprah
powder cake away should I see how much
these cost so this is the Oprah
illuminating blush stripes full-size
this is $35 so it's basically a
highlight or you can use it as a for
color waiting for ya for color eyeshadow
palette or never heard of the brand
Oprah so this is what it looks like I'm
gonna swatch it all together like you
would wearing it as a blush that's
actually really pretty it's like a light
peachy kind of shimmery color these are
really pigmented the white one is
perfect if you're a pale princess you
need that highlight going so this is
what they all look like individually see
this is my thing how the heck do people
go like this and it focuses on their
hand without making focusing noises tell
me how to do that because I have a mic
and it still doesn't work because have
it not on auto focus right now side
tangent okay a little bit powdery when
you blend them in this way it looks nice
why do I have like ten things the baby
wipes over there
that was the Oprah powder cake now I
want cake next is the cool way smoothing
lotion some kind of hair thing let's
read about it this is normally 2495
packed with vitamins and proteins just
smoothing control unruly hair applies
needed to damp or dry hair and then
style is usually what does that smell
like that smells exactly like something
it sounds pretty liquidy looks like it's
like a clear formula I was exactly like
something my hair super long I might be
doing a hair teen video I don't know
what you guys want to see that next is a
perfume like that's kind of risky of
them to put in a perfume because I feel
like everyone has such different scents
preferences preferences ooh
this actually smells so good this is the
Harvey prints hello oh this smells
amazing it normally retails for 21
dollars
these are scents with purpose you can
normally buy them on Harvey Prince calm
already uh perfume on we're going for it
yeah I like this and I feel like I don't
have anything like this yet this is the
last thing in this box Jing I velvet lip
jewel highly pigmented long-lasting
color macadamia seed oil shea butter so
it's like a lip pencil reminds me of the
Revlon that's : you know I'm talking
about this is actually really pigmented
that's a pretty color feel like this is
a nice like spring tiny red maybe I'll
include that in shadow shoes doesn't
really smell like anything you don't
have to sharpen it which is nice you
just twist it up from the bottom and
I've never heard of this brand the thing
I like about these kind of boxes is that
you get to try products from brands that
you would never find out about really
otherwise I'm really just about this
perfume alright so that was everything
in my boxycharm box for $21 I feel like
that was totally worth it revealed 2
palette alone like what the heck's let
me know down below what other boxes you
guys like and if you think they're any I
should try out if you want to check out
boxycharm yourself
I will leave their link down below if
you like this video and you want to see
more unboxing videos give it a thumbs up
so I know I also wanted to mention is
super quickly that I started a new
series on my blog called new ship Friday
every other Friday which is basically
where I post all the new makeup that
came out that week or things that I
found or things that you guys tweeted me
I'll put that link down below but if you
come across any new products that you
see or anything just tweet me or tag me
in something on Instagram and I'll
screenshot it love you guys thanks for
