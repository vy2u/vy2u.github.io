now I'm so freaking excited white walls
hell yeah it's like 9 p.m. right now
letting in here is a lot severe than
anticipated so we're gonna do our best
the movers are coming tomorrow so I
wanted to get this film for you guys
today so if you haven't been following
my snapchat which is the halo snaps my
roommate and I moved into a new
apartment it's like a major upgrade from
our old apartment I'm no longer living
in the living room
I'll leave my playlist down below from
my room related videos so you can see
what my living situation is like for
house living in the living room I now
have a wall with doors in a normal room
that's fabulous so I'm just going to
give you guys a tour let's do this so
here's the front door this is what you
see when you first walk in let's start
going down this holiday so these floors
are all the original floors refinished
which I freaking love we're going to
have to like majorly turn up the ISO
right now they'll probably be grainy but
that's the only way I can get enough
light right now I just do the home goods
haul which you would have seen if you
watch my vlog I think this video might
actually be it before the blog so over
here there's like a little corner where
I'm going to put a cute like decorative
shelf thing and then we're thinking our
we'll be over here and there's the
dining room yes when there's lots of
light coming in during the day when I
should be filming this there's actually
tons of closet space there's a closet
right here this probably will keep like
bathrooms and cleaning stuff and
everything because there's actually a
few more closets so the walls are like a
blue light that was not intentional I
went to Home Depot and there's like 40
shades of white who knew I picked the
one that looked the most like white
which is a tad blue but I kind of liked
it
I mean they're deleting I'm putting the
couch against this wall and then doing
like the gallery wall thing behind the
couch or if we end up getting a TV and a
console we'll put the TV and console
right there
and then put our couch like right here
this is the table I got today from Ross
and I'm freaking obsessed with and this
is our dining room area this is the only
light in the living room so I'm
definitely going to have to get our lamp
or something and then you walked around
the corner and here are a pretty kitchen
so I left the walls in the kitchen tan I
felt like it went better with the black
and the floors they had gone in here
this is like a major upgrade from our
last kitchen I just got this rug today I
love the countertops in here they're
like this speckled granite with some
like gold flecks in it I love the
countertops just off is cutting board
today these drawers are a tad weird the
only thing about this kitchen is the
lack of storage
there's things are laid out kind of
weird like these drawers don't fully
open they're like mini drawers the stove
is electronic which is super nice easy
to clean so again the granite counters
sink dishwasher the counter space is a
little bit small I'm picturing with a
microwave and our Keurig and stuff
there's gonna be like very little room
to cook
we might end up getting a really tiny
table right here like a lot of those
halls like a little almost like a
console thing but just so we can click
on it I don't know we'll see I started
putting away some of our mugs I'm
obsessed with these mugs I found at Ross
I think we're going to put our glasses
over here because me and my roommate are
both hell is short so anything on these
top arose we're like not going to be
able to reach probably have to get a
stool because there's no way and help
either of us are going to be able to
reach those four people problems
and I'm feeling it let's continue on so
walking through again there's the front
door there's a closet right here which
actually has a ton of room I started
putting like paint and it cools and
random stuff down there this was
probably where I'm going to be putting
all of my like bathroom products because
their bathroom doesn't have very much
space there's another closet right here
and this one is huge like look at this
this is a full-on closet and then you
come over here here's our bathroom so
our bathroom is a little bit tricky
here's an overview those curtains are
from Ross and I'm really pretty they're
like a silver taupe neat kind of thing
love the white tile in the bathroom the
only issue in this bathroom is the
serious lack of any kind of storage
you can't put one of those things over
the toilet because the space is too
small right here and there's also that
towel rack right there there is a
medicine cabinet which is nice I got
this rug today at Ross this rug is more
comfortable than my bed I might just
sleep on here I got this little rack
thing hopefully that'll help with some
of the storage issues there's a towel
rack right there I don't know let me
know if you guys have any ideas for this
bathroom I might also put like a shelf
above the towel rack I think that might
help I think
doable we just have to get creative this
marble soap dispenser is like my
favorite purchase from today thought it
from Ross it was like 6 bucks
and I freaking love it so moving on
let's do my roommates room first maybe
we should turn on her lights this is my
roommates gramma she liked the tan this
is the original color that was in our
entire apartment
I cannot stand tan so I wanted to paint
the rest of it white and she didn't care
so her room is still tan she likes tan
these rooms are a lot bigger than we
expected the unit that they showed us
was like half of this size literally it
also goes over here since it's probably
where it'll put her desk or something
and there's a heater right there which
is nicer is her closet and then is my
room so I also had it painted white this
room is a tiny bit bigger I basically
had the shittiest room in our last
apartment and we all put the same amount
so we just kind of figured that now
we'll switch it up so this is the first
time in my life that I've actually had
like the nice room it had doors the
normal apartment and it feels great so
okay I just have some random stuff in
here right now
some boxes to put away the movers are
coming with all my friends and stuff
window and then here is the closet have
some clothes and stuff to put away but
it is pretty huge which is nice it goes
that way and it goes the other way you'd
probably add like another rack or
something along this side so I'm stoked
I'm basically getting all
make up story right now my makeup is
like all over the place I have no kind
of organization it's hard because that's
like that is one of my jobs I want to
make it like a very dedicated space to
YouTube and I want it to be organized
and I want to be able to see what I have
we're probably going to have to make a
trip to Ikea to get the Alex night doors
I'd have to figure out like what I want
the background to be and the lighting
and where I'm putting the Ringway and
everything to be determined so that is
our apartment I'm so excited we're in an
amazing location we have a rooftop deck
which I'm stoked about my apartment and
space and like decoration and everything
is like something that makes me really
happy so I'm super excited to decorate
this place and just finally have like
white walls and good furniture and like
things that I've been wanting for a
while also want to say a quick thank you
for all of the amazing get well health
good health wishes that you guys sent my
way I really appreciate it and it meant
a lot to me and okay love you guys
thanks for watching see you Maxie
