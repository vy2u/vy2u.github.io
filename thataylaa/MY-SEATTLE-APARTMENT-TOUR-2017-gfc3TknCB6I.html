you guys a new apartment in Seattle I'm
going to have all the moving vlogs
linked down below but I have like four
five up documenting the whole moving
process unpacking organizing parents
coming to help all that fun stuff but
everything is pretty much all set up
which feels amazing if you enjoy this
video while you're watching don't forget
to give it a thumbs up I am sitting
right now it is a lot let's get into the
tour all right so it's hard to show this
angle but when you walk in the front
door this is what you walk into there's
a space over here so in here is where
the washer and dryer is this is the
first time I've had a washer and dryer
in my apartment and let me tell you it
is the best thing I've ever experienced
it makes me so excited to do laundry so
the closet is actually pretty big I
added the Shelf right there where the
toilet paper is on and then I have this
little cart which is kind of holding a
bunch of the knickknacks and stuff so
usually these doors re they're both open
or ones open just because I go in and
out of there a lot that wood wall decor
I got from Target I love it I kind of
wish I put it in different spots because
since that door is always open
I don't really get to look at it a lot
but over here I have two floating
shelves I still want to add something
something there's a super long hallway
in here okay so when you walk down the
hallway here's the first room on the
left the bathroom and I probably have a
different outfit on right now than in
the other clothes because I'm filming
this a different day so here's a little
overview of the bathrooms that is a
squatty potty and it was the best
birthday present I've ever received at
first didn't like to color the walls but
it's grown on me it's like it more of a
taupe than the tan which I think works
really well with the countertop which is
frigging marble you guys know how I feel
about my marble showed you guys in
different vlogs kind of how I set up
down here I'm constantly trying out new
products and if I don't see them I won't
remember to use them so that's basically
why the Shelf is here these are all
products that I'm trying out things that
are new or just new to me this little
gold thing holding my flat iron was
actually from a silverware site I just
used it for this it's wood toothbrush
holders from Target jewelry stand this
from Amazon and I actually really like
it in here I like the gold touch that
ads trashcan is also from Target I love
the look of the warm wood with the black
and white this little shelf I got from
Hobby
that one on the other rolls also from
Hobby Lobby I purchase those last year
when I was in the office space I'm no
longer shopping at Hobby Lobby after
recent events a big plan I think with
from home goods I want to say then to
the left of the toilet is a shower it's
a really nice big shower with a tub I've
never had a tub in my apartment that I
can actually use tells the got are from
Target have this really cute design on
the bottom and it's also reversible this
rug is perfect I feel like it ties in
the marble and everything and it's the
comfiest thing ever this was from Russ
shower curtains have these little gold
triangles on them this is from Target a
little peek in the shower it's actually
perfect if it has that ledge which holds
all of my products this I had in our
other apartment this is hanging in the
living room before with like a set of
three I bought the actual print off of
Etsy it's just like a PDF that you
download when you get it printed all the
things I can find online will be linked
down below in the description box so
this is what the bathroom looks like
it's so nice having counter space and
having a place to like put everything's
actually a lot of storage under here I
got this little under sink organizer
thing have a bunch of hair products and
stuff in here so I just love it when you
come out of the bathroom here's what the
hallway looks like they've been on the
hunt for a floor mirror that's wood
which is actually very hard to find so
the silver mirror is going to be going
and I think it'll look a lot better once
the wood Mayor's here so this work I got
off of Amazon plants and Amazon and
different assets this is like entryway
into the living room of stuff and then
I'm going to show you guys this room
first so this room right here is
technically the bedroom I had my
apartment laid out traditionally this
would be the bedroom it is a huge room
tons of windows and natural light and in
this video I wish you guys could see the
view and the windows and everything but
I have the blinds closed just because
it's the internet privacy but my plan
kind of all along was to find a space
where I could use the bedroom as my
filming office makeup organization
closet all that kind of stuff and then
just put my bed in the living room kind
of sectioned off kind of like a studio
so I worked from home my priority when I
was looking for apartments was a bunch
of natural light and a big enough office
space where I wouldn't be crammed since
I've been on YouTube I've been filming
in the freakin tiniest spots like
crammed between a bed and a closet and
that's something when you work from home
it's really important to separate
those two things or else it can just
feel like you're working all the time
I've been in this apartment since the
beginning of July and so far this has
been working out amazing so I'm super
happy with how everything is laid out
let me show you this room so I'm just
going to give you guys kind of an
overview of this space I'm not going to
go in depth about this room because I
think I'm going to be doing a separate
Beauty room tour let me know if you guys
want to see that like going through the
makeup storage and everything like that
those three racks are from Amazon all
the bins are from Lowe's on the bottom
two rack and these acrylic drawers are
all from the Container Store I do want
to get something for above here like a
cool piece of wood art or something like
that so here's my filming table this is
from the office space a lot of stuff you
guys are seeing will be from the office
space I did a separate tour of that so
I'll link that in a little eye in down
below but this is actually just an IKEA
kitchen counter top and then I just put
it on IKEA legs this thing is like the
best ten dollars I've ever spent this is
a coffee cup form you can get it off
Amazon when I'm filming or working in
here I just keep it on because it just
keeps your coffee warm is great
life-changing as well I have my hundred
thousand YouTube button I'm not going to
go into the lighting and monitors and
all that since I'm going to have a whole
other Shore on it and this corner I have
my IKEA Alex drawers that are stacked on
top of each other two of the six drawer
units this is what I've always had last
few years I've had these I just kind of
reorganize them and label them this kind
of dinky I done I came up with this
genius idea the light kept falling over
so we needed something to weigh it down
so I just have these little weights like
strapped to it it's probably a better
way to do that but whatever don't really
think this through but I have all of my
nail polishes hung up behind here I
actually don't mind excite really care
about seeing them but but I probably
should have put it on this wall or
something we hung those before I got the
lighting situated so I didn't actually
know there's going to be a light on top
of this thing this room is freaking huge
there's all the room for all the things
right here I could do yoga I could work
out if I ever did that so against this
well I have this IKEA little shelving
thing that I had in my other apartment
and I film I sit right here and you guys
see this in the background that's why
they're hung low so that they're in
frame mats from Target that's from Hobby
Lobby it has been 95 degrees nowhere in
Seattle has a/c so you just got to fan
it up so I've been having this fan on
24/7 and then on this wall I wanted to
keep it fairly blank so I would have a
wall in case I needed a wall for like
outfit videos or just Instagram pose or
whatever just a blank wall
maximizing its from target so when you
walk in here this is a walking closet
I've never had a walk-in closet in my
life it is so great I showed you guys in
one of the moving vlogs my parents
helping me install the Rubbermaid closet
system but basically when I moved in all
there was was this rack across in this
rack across so basically my mom
organized all of this Thank You mom she
does an amazing job
we installed this Rubbermaid closet
system which is only like a hundred
bucks on Amazon and you can basically
arrange it however you want so we added
a second rack down here added those rack
C brown leather bins are from Lowe's and
then these two drawers are actually
perfect in here this is what I used to
have more makeup in I got these off of
Amazon they're like the IKEA knockoff
looking at it from the other angle we
also added this shelf up here we had
this extra from the laundry room which
worked out perfectly because it just
adds so much more space it goes all the
way up to the ceiling so in there I have
like camera boxes and a more tech stuff
hats and then on the other wall over
here we have my good old leopard robe
comment down below if you've been
watching since the leopard wrote blog
days so have some shoes on there this
little wood thing is actually from my
first boss out of college which is like
kind of my mentor and she gave me this
when she moved to New York it says dream
big little one by the way I didn't paint
anything this is how everything was
painted when I moved in and I love the
accent walls the gray I love the white
walls walking back out of here so just
you can see like the angles that's
coming from the bathroom we walked down
this hallway there we go and then here
is this little wall so I have my bar
cart thing here this used to be in my
office at the south of hot look all
public link down below but basically
norstrom racks flash-sale site they have
amazing things I shop in there literally
every day budget that mirrors from
Wayfarer and here's a little overview of
the bar cart situation is still not
totally organized I want it so on this
bottom shelves we just have some wine a
few glasses I got those cute cactus
glasses from Dollar Tree actually and
then I have some little Moscow Mule shot
glasses down there this is a k-cup
little spinning carousel thing that was
from Amazon the cute little tea thing is
where I keep my loose leaf tea besides
this this is also loose leaf and then I
have a Cuisinart water heater the reason
why I got this was because it said it
was Wireless not true
you definitely have to have it plugged
in
reason wives Wireless is because this
comes off alright so now we're moving
into the kitchen space slash studio
because this is basically where I've set
up my bed so I'm going to flip you guys
around so here is a little overview
before we get into it so with kitchen on
the right little couch living room area
desk and then here's my bed wish I could
show you guys with the windows all the
way open because the light and the view
is amazing I love it's like one of my
favorite parts about this apartment it's
all the natural light that comes in
especially in the morning my favorite
thing is to like sit in that little Sun
patch by the window alright I don't even
know where to start so this does not
bother me at all if you think of this as
a studio I mean this is pretty much how
it studio would be laid out I don't have
like ragers or parties or anything in my
apartment so it really doesn't bother me
that my bed is in like the living space
so that's just me personally doesn't
bother me at all so imma start right
here this huge floor-to-ceiling mirror
is from Ikea it's amazing and it's super
affordable for Florida ceiling mirror
had this mirror in the office space that
is a real plant which we will get into
have these plants for like a month I
showed them in a vlog buying them and
I'm pretty sure I've already killed two
of the four the exact names the plants
were in that vlog but I got this little
planter from CB to have this little
dreamcatcher above here's actually from
Claire's because I was making this into
like a studio kind of feel I didn't want
full-on bed in here I felt like that
would look a little bit odd and I loved
being on the floor I always sleep better
when I'm like sleeping super low to the
ground I don't know what it is it just
feels like super comfortable to me you
guys saw me setting up the helix
mattress in a vlog but I just put it
directly on the floor you don't need a
box spring or anything don't you guys on
Twitter I've asked me my updated
thoughts on the helix mattress and I
love it I've been sleeping really good
recommend it if you're in the market for
a new mattress I looked into a ton of
alternatives you can like DIY different
crate beds and little like low platform
bed kind of things but in the end I just
liked it best right on the floor I
wanted it as low to the ground as
possible basically the whole thing is
actually an ottoman from home goods I
decided to use it kind of as a
nightstand so I put this wood tray on
here and has this really pretty copper
thing on there got that
from home goods as well that planting
was in my old office space the jar the
jar was that held the vase there we go
the vase was from Ross duvet cover I got
from Amazon it's super soft that pillow
was like the best total purchase of my
life all these pillows were from home
goods
except that crochet one which I had for
my old apartment that was from Target so
above the bed I have this thing hanging
which I feel like adds a really nice
touch and it just like kind of separates
it off a little bit from the rest of the
space that was from Amazon so when I
wake up it's super nice because I can
look out and see the light the world out
there so let's move over to this area
next this started actually because I
basically needed like a little space
filler right there and then I thought
why don't I make that into like a little
workstation if I want to work out here
and kind of be by the light and stuff
this rug I'm in love with us from Target
the chair is from my old office space
but I got it off of Amazon and pretty
sure the cactus is from eb-2 and the pot
is from a random nursery this leaning
desk that's from the Container Store
online I'll have it linked down below
basically where I've been sitting in the
morning to work I love get my coffee
sitting over here here's my laptop then
on here I just keep some memory cards on
top of here I have some my books I have
a bunch more stored random mix of
middle-east tech marketing and Fifty
Shades of Grey
classy little trinket things are like
kind of all from my old apartment so
moving over into the couch area this is
like my favorite corner of the apartment
I think I love the way that this came
together so this space I don't know if
you guys can tell on here but it's
basically angled so it's kind of odd
shape in the corner if you have an
asymmetrical corner this kind of rug I
feel like works really well because
obviously is in a rectangle or square so
it kind of just makes it so you can't
really tell small enough it looks great
and this is just so first let's coffee
table it's from Target I really wanted
to mix the wood with the white because I
feel like it just kind of warms
everything up I'm going to show you guys
this direction because the light is
facing that way there you go now you can
really see what it looks like it's
beautiful like this was such a steal for
the price I just have some blankets
under there I love the cross wiring on
the side on top of the coffee table I
have this little thing that I got from
the Soto flea market in Seattle the
coaster
I think I got from Ross awhile ago
they're both my old apartment that I had
this little marble slab saying candle
another candle talked all about the
current situation when the moving vlogs
but I got these pom-pom curtain I have
two panels of these and then the rest of
them are just sheer white and it's super
long drapey ones to give it that like
poking me and kind of look this plant
came with a stand it's a fake plant that
I got from Target little gold super cute
like mini chair thing is from also Soto
flea market along with that red pillow
kind as I have this pillow that I got
from Etsy a while ago I had that in our
old apartment this couch was like the
score of the century I got this off of
offer up this couch is like a vintage
leather couch that I got for 250 bucks
which is amazing if you know couches
real leather has super cute mid-century
modern legs on there I originally bought
this because I was going to stain it a
brown color and then I kind of just
totally grew on me definitely looking
different on camera it's more of like a
true mustard color there we go
so here's dying plant number one I think
my issue is that it's in too much direct
sunlight I really like it in this corner
so I might just have to get a fake
fiddle leaf I wish plants could just
talk to you think I've learned that real
plants are not for me but I'm going to
try and keep this thing alive as long as
possible a little pot of habit is also
from cb2 so I'm moving into the kitchen
space here's what it looks like little
plants band I got from Ikea here are
dying plants number two and three is one
isn't doing too bad but he has some like
things going on so I basically use this
as like a kitchen island slash seating
bar area I got this off of opera but it
was originally from Crate and Barrel
pretty much brand-new it looks like it
had never been used I think it's perfect
for the spaces I got off of overstock
and they're actually very comfortable
like the way that they're shaped just
like hold your but I don't usually have
fresh five flowers and my friend got me
they use super pretty sunflowers as like
a bladed birthday present and then she
also got me this candle which is burning
for the colors in that rug I feel like
tie everything together really nicely
with the red pillow over there and
there's some like mustard tones in here
that I got from home goods the fridge
freezer dishwasher over here I just keep
my
vitamins little extreme on this marble
tray I have my planner I always keep it
here I usually have it open and I
usually have pens and things all over
here this is my planner is Erin Condren
I always get a lot of questions about
this I still use my Erin Condren planner
I use this thing 50 times a day that
plant where is that thing from maybe
HomeGoods this is my essential oil
diffuser I had this in my bedroom my old
place I love having it in here because
it makes the kitchen smell so good have
all my essential oils in here I love
using the orange one it's just like
super refreshing I'll usually put this
on in the morning I also put this down
the sink and turn the disposal on and it
makes the sink smell so good this
toaster is super cute I love the kind of
like vintage look to it that's from
Amazon I love the light colored
countertops in here I'm not sure why
they went with this tan color honestly
because they have gray floors gray walls
white the mist tan underneath here but
it's okay they're growing on me I just I
was building this place I probably want
to put tan cabinets in there nice big
sink to have a little succulent over
here at this thing I've been doing
pretty good at been a couple months with
him sometimes he looks like he's dying
but then he like comes back to life to
left of the sink I have my dish drying
rack thing love this little tassel thing
there's some gold in here and this is
actually just a placemat from Target
over here is really cool because I put
in a USB thing also under here there's
really cool lighting let me show you
guys this and there's a dish disposal
which I've never had before look at this
lighting I love turning this on at night
I'll put that lighting on reptil you
guys about these I'll put that on and
these hang things which my dad hung up
for me dad wired it so there's like a
little switch over here that night I
love turning on just those overhead
lights in this and it gives it like a
really nice warm light this is like
adulting to the extreme have a freakin
nice block the only reason why I got
this is because they had hot look credit
and I needed knives and it came in this
nice wood blocks it but wow that makes
me feel old cut my carry over here which
is from the office space need to go
grocery shopping but normally I'll have
fresh fruit and tomatoes and stuff in
there I love this little wood spoon
holder thing this I got from home goods
yeah I go from home goods showed this in
a hall then over here I just have some
like cooking oils and things
oil the oven mitt was from home good
towels are from home goods here's oven
super-exciting and the microwave is
built-in up there tons of storage in
here like I haven't even used half of
these most of them are totally empty on
the top these are my favorite things
ever I got these from a flea market here
in Seattle they have a little tack dye
in there they're so cute this plans here
basically to cover all the wires so in
here there's actually a ton of wires
down there so here's what everything
looks like from this corner of the room
alright so I think that's everything I
hope you guys liked finally seeing the
apartment I love everything about this
apartment so far
can't complain it is crazy when I think
about three years ago living in the
living room of an apartment three people
in a two bedroom and like still man a
closet to now being in my own space so
it just feels amazing I feel really
grateful to be able to be in an
apartment like this and I'm just in love
with it so I hope you guys enjoyed this

thumbs up again I'm going to have
