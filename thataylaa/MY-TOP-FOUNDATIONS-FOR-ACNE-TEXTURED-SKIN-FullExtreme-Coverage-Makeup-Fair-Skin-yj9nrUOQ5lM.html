color wheel
all right so today we're gonna be
talking about one of my all-time
favorite things ever foundation who's
shocked but not just foundation my top
top full coverage extreme coverage
foundations for acne these aren't all of
my holy grail writer dye foundations
these are just my favorite extreme
coverage gonna cover everything for
those of you who are new here I do
foundation Friday every single Friday on
my channel where I review different
foundations I also do 15 days of
foundation so I'm gonna have all of my
foundation playlist linked down below in
the description box but I've tested out
over 100 foundations at this point
definitely more than that haven't done
the math yet I have cystic acne with
combination skin I have a lot of texture
so I'm always on the hunt for a good
full coverage foundation it's not gonna
cake up and that just kind of smooths
everything over I hide some of the
texture and it just looks good you know
I'm saying I am currently on accutane
I'm on day 10 today when I filming this
I'm gonna have my acne story video
linked right here and the description
box down below if you want to hear my
whole acne history and everything you
can see what my skin looks like in every
single foundation video but here is also
a very recent photo that was taken the
same day that video was filmed just so
if you're new here you can see what my
skin looks like alright so let's get
into it I'm gonna tell you kind of my
top 9 foundations I have a couple
honorable mentions and also just some
tips and things that I've found over the
years that helps with covering acne so
like I always say foundations are one of
those things that really are totally
dependent on your skin what kind of skin
conditions you're dealing with if you
have dry skin oily skin eczema acne also
just what you prefer the coverage the
finish if you like more matte feel like
more dewy some foundations that a lot of
people absolutely love and look like
full coverage on them are at best medium
coverage on me and look super heavy
cakey and just horrible so it really
just depends on your skin these are just
my top foundations for covering acne
when I want that extreme coverage I
don't want to be seen acne peaking
through
I just want my skin to look flawless and
good this is what does it for me so I'm
gonna start out with one that if you
watch videos on YouTube at all you've
probably seen someone talking about this
at this point this kind of blew up this
year I have an older review on this and
ever since then it has been one of my
go-to foundations for specific things
which I'll tell you about but this is
the derma called makeup cover this
is the most extreme coverage foundation
I have ever found so out of all the ones
I mentioning if you want extreme extreme
coverage where you have to use the
tiniest amount of products like I'm
talking a pea-sized amount this is
amazing this is a product that I don't
use as an everyday foundation only
because on my skin it doesn't last very
well throughout the day this is one that
I like using if I'm going to be taking
photos if I'm gonna be just at an event
or just at something for a few hours
where I want my skin to look absolutely
flawless I like using this to mix in
with other foundations on its own this
is an everyday foundation for me I
recommend this for any skin type with
acne if you use it for that purpose
because you can mix this with
foundations to kind of counteract
whatever you don't like in this to say
you have super oily skin and this just
makes you greaseball throughout the day
you can mix it with a more oil
controlling mattifying foundation and
you kind of have the best of both worlds
because this adds coverage the lightest
shade is actually 2:08 so don't get 2:07
if your fair 2:07 is darker than 208 so
I use 208 it's a perfect shade match for
me I love it there are a lot of fakes
going around since this product blew up
so just be careful with where you
purchase this this tube well it looks
small will last friggin forever because
again you need literally the smallest
amount and it covers everything you do
not need concealer with this one you
don't need a spot concealer this is like
block out extreme coverage right here
and its own for me the finish of this is
actually beautiful it's very smoothing
its dewy I love the way it sits over my
texture it looks great on my forehead my
texture kind of problem areas are
usually the center of my forehead around
my nose and this doesn't accentuate any
of my texture so I do love how it looks
on its own it just doesn't hold up the
best one zone for me by the way just
looking at my list here most of the
foundations I'm going to be mentioning
have more of a dewy kind of satin finish
because that's personally what I find
looks most flattering on my skin with
texture and acne if you have a very very
matte foundation sitting on top of acne
that can sometimes accentuate it versus
if you have kind of more of a smoothing
dewy foundation your overall skin I find
just looks a bit healthier if you have
oily skin that can be a little bit
tricky because dewy foundations
typically don't tend to be the most
long-lasting on oily skin just blanket
statement
of course there are ones that are so I
find that having a good setting powder
can help with that I'm gonna link my
go-to powder is down below powders
another thing to be careful about
because if you're putting a heavy powder
on top of the heavy foundation things
can get looking real heavy real quick so
it's all about finding the right mix for
your skin which powder is sit best on
your skin as I go I just thought of this
I think I'm gonna kind of rank the
coverage just so you can get an idea of
how they compare the coverage under
McCulloch I would say is 10 out of 10
this is the most coverage I think you
can find at least on the market right
now from what I've seen next up is the
Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation
coverage on this I would say is about a
nine point five out of ten maybe like a
nine point two five out of ten if we're
really getting critical I have the shade
ten ivory light and twelve ivory twelve
ivory is too dark ten ivory is too light
there is a huge shade jump between these
by the way I'm gonna start swatches
while I'm talking about these
foundations so you can see how they
compare I rarely use this foundation on
its own because I find that it can just
look a little bit heavy on my skin it is
very very matte it can kind of cake up
around my nose area a bit so the only
way I like using this on its own is with
the Smashbox primer water underneath
this really does make a huge difference
I find that it lasts amazing throughout
the day I have slept in this combination
before got a migraine was sleeping in it
and when I woke up my face was friggin
still on even with laying my friggin
face on a hot pack this lasted these two
together if you didn't like this
foundation on its own try it with the
primer water but what I do really love
this for is using the shade 10 to mix in
to lighten with foundations and add
coverage it is awesome you need the
tiniest drop I hate the packaging of
this it gets so messy as you can see
there's a ton of foundation around
the rim here it's not even a drop or
applicators just like a stick with a
ball at the end so I really don't like
the packaging of this definitely think
it could be improved you need the
tiniest amount of this it adds amazing
coverage to whatever foundation you mix
it in with definitely mattifies it so if
you're not into matte you probably
wouldn't like this but if you aren't
matte foundations and you want something
that's gonna cover everything lasts
really well throughout the day at least
on my skin this one could be worth the
money it's obviously a bit of a splurge
I mean it's friggin Marc Jacobs as I'm
looking in this bag I'm pretty sure I
have video
on every single one the foundations I'm
talking about so if you ever want to
know if I have a specific review on a
foundation all you have to do is search
the Tayla and the name of the foundation
in the youtube search bar and it'll come
up so next up is the laura geller cover
lock cream foundation I have the shade
porcelain this is such a beautiful
foundation if you have texture this is
beautiful for smoothing out your skin it
covers amazing we're kind of getting
into now like the full coverage
foundations those are the extreme
coverage now we're going into the full
coverage the rest of them are all full
coverage hence the title video just
nothing insane like I don't think this
would cover a tattoo the Marc Jacobs in
der McCall would definitely cover tattoo
this will cover acne but it's not quite
as intense it is pretty rare that I find
a foundation that I don't have to mix
that looks great on its own and that is
just beautiful
all on its own now so this foundation is
for me I tested this out during 15 days
of foundation a couple series ago I've
been using it ever since if we're saying
the Marc Jacobs is a 9.25 on coverage I
would say this one is probably 9 maybe
8.75 oh no man all the rest I'm going to
talk about our full coverage so they're
all kind of between like an 8.5 and an
iron basically this gives you a
beautiful dewy kind of finish I almost
find it to be kind of plumping it
reminds me a lot of the milk makeup blur
liquid foundation which I'm going to
talk about this foundation I'm actually
wearing right now mixed with another
foundation when talked about just
because I was in the mixing mood but
again I love this on its own by the way
I should say the Marchak is remarkable I
probably wouldn't recommend if you have
dry skin if you do you'll have to
majorly prep your skin maybe mix this in
with something more moisturizing
definitely use a super moisturizing
primer underneath this one I think can
work for all skin types if you have oily
skin you'll definitely have to use a
super good oil controlling primer
underneath and also a powder if you have
dry skin you probably would love this
because it's very creamy feeling it's
super moisturizing so the only downside
for me with this one is that it doesn't
last amazing throughout the day this one
I get a solid five hours five six hours
out of where it's still looking great
and then it kind of goes downhill so if
I need a super long lasting foundation I
probably wouldn't go with this one I
would go with the next one I'm going to
talk about this next one if you've been
watching any of my videos recently
you've probably seen this coming this is
the milk makeup blur liquid foundation
holy cease I'm in love with this I
have multiple videos using this you want
to know my favorite way to apply this to
make this last amazing throughout the
day and look frickin flawless watch the
makeup for photos video I'll link that
one down below and in the eye too but it
just looks stunning this one I really
would say is a full coverage blurring
foundation it cysts on the skin amazing
this one hides all of my texture it
looks pretty dang a similar to the Laura
Geller cover lock probably don't need
both of these if I had to pick one that
I could only use for the rest of my life
I would probably pick oh I don't know
I think I would go with the milk makeup
only because the combination that I show
you in that video the makeup for photos
video just last amazing on my skin
definitely one of the most flawless
foundation routines I've found so far so
I think I would go with this one I don't
know if there's some variation with the
shades or something because I've seen
other people saying that this is more
matte this is definitely very dewy on my
skin I mean it's a dewy foundation I
think this one would wear best I'm
probably dry to normal skin if you have
oily skin like I do a combination skin
you can definitely make this one work
and lasts better but I think dry to
normal this would be beautiful on this
foundation is what I reach for nine out
of ten times if I want full coverage but
I'm in a major rush if I have like 10
minutes to get out the door but I still
want to be looking good and looking like
I put some effort in I'll either go for
the derma call because that one is super
quick and I can actually use it with
just a dry sponge so it makes
application super easy because you have
to waste time dampening your sponge and
all that and you literally have flawless
full coverage in like 30 seconds but
this one you can get the same effect
with this is the Make Up For Ever Ultra
HD foundation stick okay I feel like the
ranking system is kind of going to
because at this point they're all gonna
be kind of the same of course it also
depends on how much you use and how you
apply foundations to get a certain
amount of coverage I typically use a
decent amount of products especially
where I have my acne which is my chin in
like lower cheek area I don't have a lot
of acne on my forehead when I use this I
do like one two three four five on one
side of my face like five little strokes
and blend it out with a sigma f80 -
which is just the round top kabuki brush
just my favorite brush to use with this
or the elf brush I'll have both those
linked down below next to this
foundation in the description box I use
this shade 115 they now make
I think two lighter shades it is just so
quick full coverage covers my acne and
it has a really really beautiful finish
again more on the satin dewy side this
isn't one that I find to be super
long-lasting if I have somewhere I have
to be where I just want to look put
together but I don't need my foundation
lasts like 12 hours I'll use this one
these ones are technically pigment drops
but I feel like I have to mention these
because if you have acne these are bomb
for covering I use the shade n 10 these
you can use on their own you can mix it
in with the moisturizer primer you can
mix it in with other foundations I
typically wear this either on its own or
mixed in with other foundations to add
coverage and add a really pretty skin
like finish again these are dewy this is
beautifully on texture I do feel like
this breaks me out so I try not to super
frequently reach for these for that
reason just because this breaks me out
it might be totally fine on you but
these are just awesome for adding a
ton of coverage what is with this
packaging it gets so messy I hate the
packaging of this it just like cakes up
around the rim right there but if you
like dewy and you're looking for
something to mix in with other
foundations to add more coverage maybe
even alter the shade this could be a
good option that do have a ton of shades
not as well so next up is the Clinique
beyond perfecting foundation and
concealer beautiful beautiful coverage
this again is pretty quick to apply
because it has this giant doe foot
applicator so you could just put it on
your face and blend out I really like
using a brush with this again the Sigma
f80 too is bomb this one is weird
because I find that it really depends on
the skin day I'm having
how this holds up on my skin sometimes
it lasts amazing throughout the day
sometimes it starts to majorly crease
around my nose area and look a bit heavy
so I feel like this one is really
dependent on the primary you use how you
set it this isn't the lightest shade
zero-point-five breeze if you're any
more fair than I am this will be way too
dark because this one is still a bit
dark on me and this does oxidize I don't
know what it is but sometimes I feel
like it looks super matte and sometimes
it looks more dewy I think it's really
just dependent on the primer I'm wearing
that day and everything this one is just
kind of an honorable mention because I
believe this only comes in three shades
I have a video on this - this has
friggin bomb coverage this is like up
there almost with Marc Jacobs remarkable
but this is so friggin dark this is
light
shade zero eight creamy glow even mixing
in it still looks a bit dark so it's
just hard for me to wear this one but it
has amazing coverage and looks great on
the skin so if you can find a shade that
matches you it might be worth getting a
sample of this or trying it out so next
one is another foundation stick that I
actually found on Amazon I believe this
was during a 15 days foundation series
to a few series what a few series ago
this is the Joe Lee foundation stick and
soft cream there's no wording or
anything on here besides the shade on
the bottom this shade is a bit dark but
it just looks so nice on the skin I
would say this is more of a satin finish
this reminds me of like an event makeup
if you're going to prom or you have a
wedding or something coming up where you
just want your skin to look flawless
this one is beautiful this is the elf
acne fighting foundation this has
salicylic acid witch hazel camphor tea
tree oil and aloe
I wish elf came out with more shades of
this because the shade porcelain is way
too dark I have to mix this but this is
actually what I'm wearing right now
mixed with a Laura Keller puffer lock
and this always looks beautiful on the
skin it has a little bit less coverage
than everything else I'm talking about
this one I would say is probably an 8.5
maybe even like 8.25 oh you can
definitely build this up I just love the
way this feels on my skin sits on my
skin it feels pretty lightweight it
doesn't feel like I'm wearing a heavy
super heavy duty full coverage
foundation if I have a foundation that I
want to add just a little bit more of
like a skin like look to it and maybe
darken it a little bit I'll go ahead and
mix this one in because it just gives it
that skin like nice look to it I feel
like my skin reacts really well to this
foundation definitely doesn't break me
out I feel like it almost helps my skin
a little bit when I wear this so I have
two honorable mentions here and then I
have one just in my head because I
actually need to repurchase it the first
one that I don't have here is the it
cosmetics CC illumination actually CC
cream but it has great coverage not
super super full coverage but you can
build it up to full coverage especially
if you just put a little bit of spot
concealer on underneath or over top it
looks beautiful and my skin loves it I
definitely prefer the illumination to
the normal CC but they do make one that
isn't illuminating I just find that one
to look a little bit heavy on my skin
but the illumination one looks beautiful
on the skin let's look
kind of plumping just makes you look
really healthy I wouldn't say it's
completely full coverage which is why
it's an honorable mention but for
example I would mix that with something
like the Marc Jacobs remarkable just add
a bit of this in this one is an
honorable mention because this is a very
recent find I typically don't like
throwing something into a top video
unless I've tested it for like weeks and
weeks but this one I do want to mention
because this drugstore it's easily
accessible and I feel like this is one
of the most full coverage foundations I
have found from the drugstore so far
this is the CYO matte foundation no
shine zone this is in the shade 2:03
this it is too dark for me I actually
use this in a recent video if you want
to see it in action but this is a very
matte finish but it doesn't look cakey
it still looks kind of smoothing it just
sits really nicely on the skin so if you
prefer matte but you still want that
coverage and you want something more
affordable this could be a good option
for you see why I was a new brand that
carried out Walgreens I'm assuming
they're gonna expand their shade line
since the lightest shade is to 0-3 I
feel like they'll come out with a 202
and 201 maybe we can even get a 200 in
there if you're looking for a drugstore
option this one I would say it
definitely has more coverage than the
elf acne fighting foundation off of just
one layer and then the last honorable
mention is the Catrice HD liquid
coverage foundation drops this is in the
lightest shade 10 light beige too dark
again this I tested and the last 15
years a foundation series but this is
just a dropper applicator these are very
matte but they almost look airbrush it
actually looks pretty similar to this
foundation I prefer this a little bit
more actually just because I feel like
it doesn't look quite as heavy this one
I wouldn't say looks heavy on my skin
but this looks even better this does
have pretty damn good covered and
Catrice is also drugstore and you can
get that at Ulta so those are my top
recommendations for acne for texture now
that I've talked about all the products
I kind of want to touch on a couple
things just cuz I know how many
questions about this spot concealing and
color correcting those are two things
that I get asked about all the time so
spot concealing I do do sometimes it
just kind of depends on the day I always
spot conceal if I'm going out without
foundation on just to cover up my acne
I'll use the Maybelline instant age
rewind concealer do you find that if you
want to use less foundation spot
concealing is
a great option you can spot conceal
before or after foundation but I
typically like to do it before just
because then you know kind of how much
foundation you have to use on top of it
and if it's a different color than your
face like if it's too light or too dark
when you put your foundation on top of
it you won't be able to tell I typically
only spot conceal if it's a foundation
that's more medium coverage if I'm gonna
be going in with a full coverage
foundation that's gonna cover most of my
acne if not all of it there's no point
to add on more product so for example if
I was gonna be using the CL long lasting
foundation or the Estee Lauder Double
Wear need something that doesn't have
quite full coverage on its own instead
of going in with two full layers these
are something that usually I would use
spot concealer before so when I go in
with a medium coverage foundation my
face still looks like full coverage so
color correctors i've talked about in
the past a while ago but i am just not a
fan of color correctors some people will
say if you have acne use green color
correctors because green counteracts red
bla bla bla color wheel color correctors
are just ridiculous to me because you
put something on to counteract a color
that you're then gonna put concealer on
that you're then gonna put foundation on
it's just too many steps it doesn't make
sense if you have very intense
hyperpigmentation or just discoloring or
something that you really can't find a
foundation to cover it or a concealer to
cover it that is when i can see color
correcting helping but if you don't and
you're just like me and you have redness
and acne to me it's just kind of an
unnecessary step it just is like no I
don't want to go there
that's just my stance on it I feel worse
for you to do it so I think that is
everything that's all the Foundation's I
hope I remembered everything I wanted to
say I feel like it's gonna be a hell
long video if you did stick around and
you're still here I love you comment the
word sunglasses down below I just looked
and saw sunglasses if you enjoyed this
video and you did find it helpful don't
forget to give it a thumbs up by the way
on my face so I don't forget for the
description box and so you guys know my
eyes are all the new BH Studio Pro
ultimate artistry eyeshadow palette
there's what the shade looks like I just
went in with a random mix of a bunch of
shadows in this palette lipstick is the
girl ashtec liquid lipstick in spice my
face highlight is the new hourglass
what's it called metallic strobe
lighting
pallette all these will be linked down
below bronzers the girl lactic bronzer
blushes BH Cosmetics the pink peachy one
that I used in the first impressions
video lashes I actually stacked two
lashes which I don't think I've done
that in years but I stacked the BH to
0-3 lashes which are super shore with
the I'll or accents number zero zero
five these are just like corner lashes
so I just stacked those right in the
corner just to add some volume out there
because I felt like it looked a little
too short and plain alright what time is
it
I never film when it's dark out it's six
o'clock right now and it's already dark
but I love you guys thanks for watching
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
