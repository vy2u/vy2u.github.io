filming my first ever makeup collection
video don't ask me how I've been on
YouTube for like 3 years now has it been
3 years and I've never done a makeup
collection video when I started YouTube
I was in college in H super shitty house
and I'm pretty sure all of my makeup was
stored in like Dollar Tree containers
above the toilet just so nice finally
having an area that's all my makeup I
can actually see what I have and I feel
like I use more products because I
actually can see them and like find them
when I'm looking for them what a concept
everything is organized and I have like
a specific place for all of my makeup so
I'm super happy with the setup right now
I hope you guys like this video let me
know if you want a full room tour and
everything if you're new here hello
join the burrito family and don't forget
to click the subscribe button down below
if you want to see my makeup collection
and storage situation you're in the
right place just keep watching I hope
you guys can hear me OK I'm like hiding
behind a ring light so here's what my
setup looks like in my new apartment I
got two of these six Alex drawer units
from Ikea and basically just stacked
them on top of each other so as you can
see here this is where the first scene
ends and I just took off the rollers and
stacked it on the other unit I like
these versus the Alex 9 drawer because
they have huge drawers that just store a
ton and I just like the way that these
look better if you have a smaller space
the IKEA 9 drawers are about half of
this size I think I have my mirror on
the right side right here and that's
just a letter from a subscriber that I
love and thank you amber I always keep
it by my mirror
so this mirror was from Ross and then
I'm just gonna go in and get started so
on top here this mirror that I got is
from home goods and I love it I love
that style typically I have my IKEA
plant sitting between there but today
how freaking beautiful are these flowers
you have the Bucks farm fresh flowers on
here the Bucks is a super unique company
they actually get their flowers from the
soil of a volcano in
Equador like what the heck they're
eco-friendly and sustainable and I love
how they come in but form so then you
actually have time to like enjoy your
flowers while they're blooming and the
base that they're in I just got from
metropolitan market if you're in the
Seattle area I do have an offer code for
you guys if you buy one bouquet from the
boobs you can get your second one for
free so send it to a friend or your mom
or your dad whoever you're feeling so
moving on this candle is from I believe
this was from Ross or TJ Maxx I love my
man cents this one is a perfect guy
scent kind of candle and I just love the
color of it and I love how it looks up
here I just keep it a little diamond
mirrored tray and this is from the
Dollar Tree I always keep my watches up
here just so remember to wear them
mostly this is my Michael Kors I don't
even know what the style of this one is
I like to keep a few lipsticks on
display up here they're just some random
MAC lipsticks and these are LeBeau
cosmetics liquid lipsticks I actually
really like these I did an Instagram
post on them I love the black and gold
which is mostly just why I keep them up
here I think this lipstick holder I
either got from hot look or TJ Maxx I
keep these two white things back here
and I usually just keep random stuff
when I'm filming a video if I'm going to
be doing a makeup look and there's a
hair in here okay this one's really
dirty not going to be showing you the
inside of that too long but when I do a
makeup tutorial I usually put all the
makeup I want to use in one of these
alright so moving on to the drawers if
you collect makeup this is honestly the
best investment you should have like an
Amazon crash cart those holding all my
makeup and it was just all over the
place in our old apartment which is why
I never filmed a makeup collection video
you actually couldn't even see my makeup
so this is the best choice I've ever
made first drawer is super random this
is definitely one of the more random
drawers I haven't like gone in and
changed any of this for this video like
this is real life this is how it looks
so in this top organizer I have all of
my mascaras I typically only have one or
two mascaras open at a time because I
don't want to dry out here I have some
to face melted liquid lipsticks and then
the LA girl glazed lip paints that came
out after it and we're basically like
the copy of them back here I don't even
know what this is I have like super
random lip products that basically just
wouldn't fit in my lipstick drawer some
L'Oreal la mats keep all the receipts
for things that I'm not sure if we'll
need to return on this side just so I
don't lose them moving on to one of my
favorite joys this is the lipstick
drawer the majority of my collection is
liquid lipsticks I love liquid lipsticks
I'm not a huge lipgloss person one of
the hardest things about organizing your
makeup is finding affordable containers
I got all of my little containers from
storables if you have one in your area
you should definitely go these were the
most affordable containers I've found
they hook together so it's everything
from like sliding around in your drawer
they just have tons of different sizes
and I'm very happy with them under here
are all of my colour-pop liquid
lipsticks these are all color pop under
here there's like a few different rows
and these are all just these dollar ones
that I found on eBay that I'm going to
be reviewing I really have a place to
put them so they're just chillin on top
with color pop back here all of my other
liquid lipsticks these are all just
mixed brands I really like the la splash
smitten Lipton Milani and more matte lip
creams which they just announced they're
going to be permanent which is super
exciting one of the NYX suede liquid
lipsticks which I haven't tried yet some
random like ultra pixel stuff and what
else is in here
essence Rimmel we've got a little bit of
everything this container right next to
it I don't really know what's going on
in here we have some pure minerals or
pure cosmetics a little things under
here I have Milani lipsticks money is
probably my favorite drugstore lipstick
brand a couple Maybelline ones these are
some urban decay lipsticks which I
really like I'm wearing the shade strip
a lot recently it's a nice like dark
brown kind of nudie color and look at
this packaging I'm not a big normal
lipstick person I usually go for liquid
lipsticks everyday so I really have a
whole lot of lipstick and here are all
colour-pop lippie stix color pop sends a
ton of PR packages so most bloggers have
like pretty much every
color of the collection and I love the
lippie stix these are one the only
lipstick formulas that I wear this is my
lip liner drawer this one like didn't
fit so it's just showing sideways I
really love the Sens lip liners these
are super affordable you get them out
Ultra or Fred Meyer some color pop ones
in here at BH Cosmetics Palladio in this
container there's just mostly lip
glosses dried cosmetics some random
lipsticks that didn't fit Hart lip
surgeon Maybelline on the side over here
I keep some Jake at wonder lip paints
these are fun for just like crazy kind
of looks or for other uses they kind of
slide around on your lips so I don't
really like these too much but I do have
every color so if I ever need them up
there here a third drawer down we have
all eyes shadows and I products it was
kind of tricky figuring out how to door
and display eyeshadows just because I
don't know I feel like the size is kind
of strange and you still want to be able
to see everything I do like these long
skinny containers for this and I have to
get another one though because these
color pop eyeshadows are getting a
little out of control and here I have
some Milani single eyeshadows and then
some Urban Katee ones that are still in
the packaging on the right each side I
have like pigments and glitters I think
these are all Mac yeah
most C's are from when I used to work at
Mac what are these I think these are elf
elf mineral eyeshadows which I actually
really love if you wet them they look
like pigments and these are super
affordable steal a kitten that's
probably a B in there I have a couple
makeup geek pigments in here this is
Vegas lights I haven't really given you
to try it in this drawer this is all
pencil eyeliners I kind of have them
sorted by the colors over here and black
in white and neutrals over here so I
have a lemon cream one I do not support
lemon creme any more I bought this
before that whole thing happens that
should probably be in there a bunch of
NYX pencils covergirl ICO it's kind of
like an assortment of pencil liner
nothing too exciting I have a couple gel
liners back here too
I don't really use gel I haven't really
gotten into it these are all Lancome
pencils I've tried a couple of these and
I wasn't super impressed I have a
Jordana one that I used in my Halloween
tutorial Urban Decay a lot of the drawer
one's a glitter liner over here the
tonymoly glitter liner which I really
like there is a good like four inches of
space back here that I can't really
reach so I have some stuff I don't
really use back here just random
eyeshadow palettes and things should
probably just toss these because I
clearly never use them don't really know
what's going on in this container I have
some pure eye polishes these are new and
they're really interesting they're like
a liquid primer / liquid eyeshadow
product they're really interesting I
have some eye primers oh yeah all my eye
primers are in here so this is why it's
like mostly cream shadows I use these
for eye primer it's sometimes this
physicians thing I don't know why it's
in here that was horrible some Mac Paint
Pots down there I have some eyeliners
over here that haven't been open pull on
the eye tech and the Milani liquid eye
so that's the eyeshadow drawer next
drawer we have all blushes what's going
on the back here this is the blush
bronzer drawer and let's zoom you guys
in I kind of have it sorted out by like
peachy tones and then pinkier blushes
love the Monte Rose blush essence silky
touch blush is nice wet and wild
pearlescent pink this is looking real
drinkie my Physicians Formula shimmer
trick which I love I have a few Rimmel
stay blush
cream blushes down here I did a full
review on these a while ago so I'll link
that down below or go in addition Mac
blush that I still love this is in the
shade full of joy and it's like a
purpley blush how pretty is that this
packaging drives me insane like look at
how huge this is why is that necessary
this is just wide open because I
actually lost the top to this classy but
I still really like the blush this is
the makeup revolution now blush and it's
super pretty this is like a perfect just
walked outside and I'm freezing kind of
blush of a sleek makeup blush and this
is a UK brand super pretty I love the
packaging of these elf flushes color pop
a few of their cream Stagg don't usually
like cream products too much just the
way that I like to apply my foundation I
don't know I just not really feeling the
cream products then in the front here is
a lot of just peachy blushes I have my
I'm out L'Oreal True Match blush which I
love innocent flush clean color and then
this Too Faced heart blush which is just
so pretty to look at love the packaging
on this the product is like I have a
Becca cosmetics blush that I got off of
glambot and here makeup revolution trio
one of my favorites I love this
highlight in this section back here it's
mostly highlights liquid and cream I
love the essence blew me up one and over
cosmetics color pop this one was
beautiful this is road trip and I
believe this one was limited edition
it's always a limited edition ones that
I'm like obsessed with Gemma kid face
I've had this for years is probably
totally dried up but this is a beautiful
cream highlight I'm not sure where you
can get this it's from a UK brand but I
got this when I first started out on
YouTube I think actually Shannon XO
might have mentioned it like years ago
and that's why I bought it
very Luminizer my needs a little help in
this section we have eyebrow products I
don't really use these too much just
because I use the same thing on my brows
every day a couple like liquid gel
eyebrow products just use Mac past Wylie
this is actually a gel eyeliner I used
to use this for my eyebrows when my hair
was a little bit more red these are all
my single bronzers and then a couple
like a random highlight this is Mac
mineralize skinfinish and soft and
gentle love this highlight slate into
Chanel fancy fancy this packaging is
just beautiful I haven't used this that
much I got it off glam bought and the
color is like a little bit off for my
skin tone it's a little bit to oranjee
Mac taupe blush is a nice contour if you
have pale skin super cool tone a
Physicians Formula bronzer a NYX blush
and raisin I think the balm cosmetics
down there and then a Milani baked
bronze I don't know it's not here so
we're gonna find out together I have a
morphe brushes this is a blush thing ya
have one on there blush palettes back
here they a mini Z palette just has a
few random things in it and essence an
Club bronzer and then a huge 2:8
cosmetics disc back here I should use
these too
this is a cream one and then this is a
powder version I think yeah I'm actually
going to keep that outfit so knees that
and then I have a polished choice thing
back here on this side
have the two-faced nofilter a selfie
pellet honestly this is one of the
strangest products I've ever seen I
don't know I just don't see this
settling well at all like look at these
colors I have a couple backups of the
Acosta manic CC creams which I love and
that's that drawer all right this is my
foundation drawer this is my favorite
drawer I have I am a foundation junkie
clearly foundation is like my thing I
love trying out new foundations this is
just like what I collect I love mixing
them they make me happy I don't really
have these sorted out anyway if you see
a foundation in here and you have pale
skin don't think that it'll work for
your skin tone like I said I'd try out a
lot of stuff a lot of it doesn't work
for my skin it's too dark one of my
favorites hard candy glamoflauge for
pale skin I wasn't a huge fan of
superstay better skin we have L'Oreal
True Match under their Ready Set
gorgeous maybelline superstay used to be
one of my favorite foundations I still
love it I just wish they made lighter
shades it's so freaking darts is the
older HD one I also have the new HD one
but it's like on my vanity thing Mac
foundations a few a cosmetics CC creams
NARS sheer glow elf acne finding
foundation down here
no need cream Lancome I'm still testing
this out to review for you guys if you
see any foundations in here that you
guys want me to review just comment it
down below I did do a review on this I
love this foundation but it broke me out
pure minerals back here maybelline super
no stay matte Rimmel stay matte jouer
moisturizing womanising thing this did
nothing for me
l'oreal infallible Estee Lauder Double
Wear down there I'm seeing my Manic
Panic dreamtone this is like my Holy
Grail foundation mixer I'll link it down
below basically just a white foundation
that you mix in with anything what else
I have another mixer this is the makeup
for everyone did not like this as much
cover FX drops this section is all
concealers mostly concealers I wear on a
daily basis are in my everyday makeup
drawer that's in my desk let me know if
you guys want to see a whole video on
that but these are kind of just random
ones that I either like didn't like or
just don't use that frequently peopling
instant age rewind a backup of my
Maybelline fit me which I love a couple
samples of Mac Pro Longwear
NYX HD love this one as well
I have this whole foundation that I
think I wanted to return because it was
way too dark but I think they lost a
receipt or something I don't remember
it's not a fan of this concealer at all
super light coverage didn't really work
for me over here I have a ton of the Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation laying
out whenever I do the review on this
foundation when my shade comes I'm going
to be doing a big giveaway with these
because they send them as PR samples and
I'm obviously can't use any of these
time I want to give you guys a chance to
win them I'll probably have like nine
different winners then you'll just tell
me your shade they actually broke in the
mail and they sent it and they resent
all of them again so thank you two-faced
you guys are amazing moving on to this
next drawer what is this drawer powders
and then primers and setting sprays and
random brushes and things not gonna go
too in depth with this drawer it will
this tray is actually not from storable
this one was from Amazon I think inish I
don't I wouldn't recommend it it's just
like a super cheap not even plastic what
is this it's like bendy like you could
cut this in half not going to go through
all my powders but I really like the
laura geller one these are mostly
translucent ones are like setting powder
loose powders and then I have a couple
random ones back here that I never
really use this is formula mat Too Faced
I really like the Too Faced cocoa powder
foundation I'm rares over here have all
the makeup forever primer as they just
sent out this is a illuminator I'm not
really sure why that's in there I have
some samples Smashbox photo-finish I
have to try a lot of these a lot of
these I haven't used at all just because
primers tend to break me out super
easily I usually stick with my body shop
primer just because I don't want to
start breaking out again a lot of
primers have silicon in it so you have
to be careful like this one breaks me
out horribly maybelline baby skin
Laura Mercier I used to always use this
I love the Laura Mercier one Allegro pro
prep I really like this primer if you're
looking for a good silicone one to just
be like super smoothing I love trying
new setting sprays NYX dewy finish I
really like Lancome in love I haven't
been able to find this anywhere online I
picked this up at a makeup CCO I think
that's what they're called right CCO
yeah this is like the best product I
found like better than tatcha
dewy skin at Mei
your skin super dewy it is super
perfumey and it sprays out like a fire
hydrant but other than that it's great
Scandinavia I used to use this all the
time until I discovered my L'Oreal
setting spray this is my favorite
setting spray this is just sitting on my
table because I use it every day
thank you it clogs Haddix brushes back
here that I need to open a makeup
revolution Pro fix setting spray that
Kara have the Cody or Sun powder way too
dark for my skin so I don't really use
that that often and I have this random
like lip plumper thing did you guys see
this on Instagram and I want to try it
wasn't super impressed by them but
they're back there if I ever need them
so we're moving on to the second set of
drawers down here and this first one is
where all of my shadow palettes are but
this is all urban decay we have the
Urban Decay Naked basics Naked 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
the anarchy palette I love the packaging
on this one the naked smoky palette is
in my everyday makeup drawer right now I
switch out all those products so it just
kind of depends on the day
it's Judy's palette by BH Cosmetics
Coastal Scents reveal the real 2 &amp;amp; 3 I
haven't really given this one too much
of a try but I'm not honestly impressed
with the color selection I love the
revealed 2 palette this is an awesome
affordable makeup palette one of my
favorites oriole lip palette nude down
there and polished choice nude mattes I
did a whole review on this thing as well
back here there's all morphe palettes is
my Mac um thing it actually isn't
holding any Mac ash eyeshadows I have a
few more feet single eyeshadows in here

random eBay lashes back here I actually
keep jewelry in this drawer this kind of
temporary but kind of not
I use these tray things that I got from
store Bowls in the bathroom section and
they're just used clear acrylic
containers the acrylics a little bit
more expensive than the ones that I
store on my makeup in like the plastic
ones I used to have this a lot more
organized but you know things happen and
here we have a really random drawer have
some Mac empties in here because you can
trade them in for free lipstick I don't
