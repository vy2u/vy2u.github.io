another first impression style or vo on
this bad boy this is the make up for
ever ultra HD foundation stick this is
pretty new I got the shade 115 which was
the lightest shoe that I could find on
Sephora's website wearing it right now
obviously and I did do a shadow n
schmooze makeup tutorial on this look
which will be up after this video is
retails for $43 on sephora's websites
websites it comes in 15 different shades
which is nice it looks like they have
some deeper shades as well looking at
the shade 115 in the tube I thought it
was going to be way too dark but I think
it could actually work it's a really
nice neutral shade it doesn't have too
much yellow or too much pink in it if
they made this like half a shade to a
shade lighter I think it would be
perfect just reading some of the claims
on sephora's website this is supposed to
be a multitasking cover stick with
invisible coverage is basically supposed
to be really good for film and TV
contains amino acid coated pigments that
provide medium to full coverage with the
lightweight second skin texture that's
supposed to just look like your skin
natural-looking radiant finish that's
supposed to be good for normal to dry
skin I could definitely see that this is
more on the luminous side so if you have
oily skin I don't know if this would
work for you just right off the bat
having it on for about an hour it is
super dewy I do have a video using their
brand new ultra HD liquid foundation so
I'll link that video down below if
you're curious about that one as well if
you want to see my thoughts on this
foundation that you're in the right
place just keep watching
alright so I've already washed in prime
the face today use the Laura Mercier
foundation primer I've been really
liking this stuff I've been layering
this on top of my body shop tea tree
primer that I use everyday for acne so
it says just to apply down the center of
the face and blend outwards with a brush
so that's what we're gonna do I like the
packaging super sleek this would be good
for traveling I got the lightest shade
which is 1:15 not sure how this is going
to go it looks a tad bit orange E and a
little bit dark the foundation brush I'm
using my favorite Sigma f80 - I'll link
this down below I believe I have a 10%
off coupon code I use this almost every
single day it just has the best coverage
and it's super dense so it's good for
blending out cream products my skin has
been doing
pretty well lately I have been breaking
out a little bit on my chin I think
that's just because I was trying out a
different primer overall just usual acne
scarring and freckles and things that
we're going to attempt to cover up and
this is fun
feel like I'm in kindergarten again I
don't know how the coverage is going to
be so we're going to start with that and
it says that it is buildable so we can
always layer it if we need to so I'm
just going to start and blend outwards
ooh doesn't feel like whoa feels like
I'm not really blending anything
the only other stick foundation I've
really used is the Maybelline fit me one
and that feels totally different than
this this is blending out like a dream
literally just feels like I'm kind of
blending out not even a moisturizer like
a primer or something I'm going to go
ahead and apply some on my whatever area
this is and just a little bit more on
the forehead to get some more coverage
yeah we'll go all over let's see if it
builds I love how the lawnmower goes on
right when I start building the color is
actually not bad at all it actually is
blending out to be pretty good I like
that it's not too yellow toned it looks
like a nice neutral shade actually is
blending out so much easier than I
expected and the finish is really nice
it literally just looks like skin and
this foundation is made for like TV and
film so being on camera which is nice if
you're a youtuber I guess it is looking
pretty dewy so I might set it with a
light powder but first thoughts it looks
super nice on the skin oh there's a
hairy needle it literally just looks
like skin
if you have dry skin this will probably
sit really nice on your skin isn't
clinging on to any dry patches at all
like that's a super quick application
what does that take me like under a
minute so it is 1103 a.m. right now I'm
going to apply the rest of my makeup and
I'll be right back alright so I have the
rest of my makeup on I just did a shadow
in shmooze video on the rest of my
makeup that video will be up after this
video it's now 12:12 so it's been on for
a little over an hour now and I
liking it you guys I did set it with a
powder you'll see exactly what I did in
that video but I did set it with the it
cosmetics bye bye pores which has the
false eyelash on it I said it with this
powder just a super light dusting
because that's what I've been doing
every single day you can see that the
luminosity still shines through this is
definitely a very luminous foundation so
if you don't like that finish you
probably won't like this but it just
looks super nice it looks really good on
camera but it also looks really good in
person it looks like skin I feel like I
could have done another thin layer and
got it like completely flawless full
coverage but it is looking pretty full
coverage right now which is like a layer
and a half so far it's looking really
good I'll be checking back throughout
the day we'll see how it lasts alright
so it came out here to film and natural
lighting but it's 5 o'clock in this
winter and it's already dark so this is
what the foundation is looking like I
have like a tiny bit of light left but
it's mostly just this light from the
kitchen it does look pretty oily but
it's not is it coming off I can't tell
it looks a little bit oily when I looked
in the bathroom here didn't look bad
like my foundation is still fully on
it's 5 o'clock right now by the way I
don't know if I just said that I'm out
to get some Indian food with a friend so
I'm going to check back in at the end of
the night but I'm not going to powder
anything because I want to see what it
looks like at the end I also wanted to
tell you guys look what just came in the
mail I am so freaking excited I just
posted on Instagram but thank you guys
so much hustle all I gotta say alright
so it is now
717 at night and I just got back it's
looking pretty oily guys this is even
set with the powder that usually keeps
me pretty matte all night long
I probably wouldn't recommend this as
like an everyday foundation if you have
super dry skin you might like this or if
you just like a super luminous
foundation for me it's like a little bit
too much I might try it with a different
powder tomorrow and see if that helps
besides the oiliness it did wear well
like it's not coming off anywhere it
looks good around the pores
there's no creasing in my like mouth
lines which are usually good blush
bronzer highlight everything is still
fully on if you guys have tried this
foundation let me know what you think of
it down below I think it's worth trying
if you have dry skin or if you want a
foundation that just looks really good
like on camera or for a short period of
time alright so that was
