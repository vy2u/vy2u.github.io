right so today we're going to be talking
about the Marc Jacobs remarkable full
coverage foundation concentrate I have
three shades here to show you guys
because I couldn't figure out my
situation where in this foundation for
about two weeks now so I'm just going to
share my thoughts with you guys and show
you a little demo how it applies with
both a brush and a beauty blender let's
do it
also quick know if you want to see a
tutorial on the rest of my makeup I do
have that it's a New Year's Eve rose
gold look I'll link it down below in a
description box because I'm pretty sure
that video will be up first whoa I
didn't breathe that whole time I said
that if you've seen my makeup collection
video or if you watch any of my videos
you guys know I'm a foundation hoarder I
love foundations they're my favorite
kind of makeup to try out your appeal
princess you know that finding the right
foundation shade is a freaking struggle
I'm going to leave a playlist with all
of my foundation reviews down below so
if you want to see foundations that I
found that work for my skintone the
watches videos this foundation claims to
be an oil-free lightweight full coverage
foundation concentrate it says you're
supposed to get 24 hours of wear with
this I actually did test that claim on
accident I had a migraine and fell
asleep with my makeup on one of the
nights I was in Tahoe if you follow me
on snapchat you saw all that not the
migraine part but everything else had a
hot pack on one side of my face which is
the side I was sleeping on when I woke
up in the morning the hot pack side was
worn off a little bit because probably
like literally melted it off the rest of
my face was literally like I could have
gone out the rest of the day with it on
it looked flawless this foundation
retails for $55 and you get a little bit
less than the standard foundation you
get 0.75 ounces but honestly you need so
little of this product that I feel like
it would last you almost longer than a
normal sized foundation Packaging is
obviously I think beautiful looks kind
of like a giant pill to me but I weirdly
like it it is a glass base right here so
if you're traveling which I was make
sure you pack it well it looks pretty
thick so I can't see it breaking unless
you like drop it off the second floor of
a building hacker ding wise the outside
is really nice you take off this lid
then it has this applicator the
applicator is questionable
I really wish they made a different kind
of application I think since it's a
concentrate they were thinking that a
dropper application would be best but
this is just kind of strange because
there's no actual dropper it's just a
stick with a little ball at the end
basically the product gets completely
stuffed down in the rim right here and
it's not even that the rim hits the
silver so you could like scrape it off
there's actually a hole down there where
the foundation is just collecting don't
like the applicator of this at all I
think they could have done a little pump
or some kind of other application I'm
just really not a fan of this you'll see
in the demo but the way that I apply it
is kind of just put it directly on my
face I don't put it on any open acne
spots because I don't want to
contaminate the applicator and then put
it back in the bottle I probably should
put it directly on a pallet but I don't
know in reality I'm not going to do that
if you're worried about the product game
contaminated you could use a pallet or
aid the back of your hand to mix it on
first and then just apply it to the face
as far as shades go like I said I have
three the first one I purchased was ten
ivory light this is the paler shade that
they make if you have pale skin this
will definitely work for you
I did a shade comparison on my Instagram
between this and the Kat Von D l42
foundation it is slightly darker but
honestly on my skin tone it's too light
which is why I purchased two more shades
it looks a little bit ghostly on my skin
tone if you're paler than I am this will
be perfect for you I applaud them for
making a shade that is pale
people-friendly thank you Mark Jacobs
hallelujah so ordered two more shades to
try and mix in with this foundation and
the ones I ordered was 12 ivory and 22
bisque light just because this one
seemed like it was a little bit more
yellow than I liked and then this one
just turned out to be way too dark this
is like an NC 30 probably yeah I'm going
to be returning this one but what I have
been doing is mixing the two lighted
shades which is ten and twelve and it
seems to be working pretty well for me
it's kind of annoying to have to mix
these every single day because sometimes
my face is a little bit darker than I'd
like or low
lighter but I might end up doing is
using an empty foundation bottle and
kind of just making my own shade and
mixing these two so I don't have to mix
it every single time
on my face so I'm going to be keeping
these two shades and then returning this
one if you're debating between the two
lightest shades I'll do a little shade
comparison right here so that you guys
can see the difference 12 is quite a bit
darker and it definitely has more yellow
tones in it lightest shade is pretty
pink tone if you're debating between the
two and you're pale I would honestly
start out with the lightest one and then
work your way up if you get the wrong
shade just keep your receipt you can
always return it at Sephora so they
obviously recommend getting their Marc
Jacobs number three buffing brush which
is a 55 dollar brush I'm not about to
spend fifty five dollars on brushes when
I have ones here that'll work just fine
my favorite brush that I found to apply
this is actually an elf brush this is
about six dollars I think leave the link
to this brush down below because they
don't have a name on here but I think
this is just the foundation brush it's a
short brush really dense really great
for blending out this foundation I've
tried this foundation with a couple
different brushes my Sigma brush is the
Beauty Blender my Real Techniques sponge
and I just love this the best with it it
gives the best coverage it looks
flawless and for a six dollar brush you
can't go wrong as far as priming and
powdering with this foundation I'm still
trying to figure out the best primer
combination for this foundation what
I've been using lately is a Smashbox
photo finish primer water I got a sample
this with my Sephora vib points or
whatever I was not buying into the whole
like priming water situation but I think
actually liked this so I've basically
been putting on a moisturizer spraying a
couple spritz of this on and then
applying the foundation blends out
easily the only downside to this
foundation that I've found so far is
that it dries very very quickly if
you're blending on your face which I do
you have to work really fast or else
it'll dry on your face before you're
fully blended work in sections so that
doesn't happen to you this is fully full
coverage I am a stickler for foundations
that claim that they're full coverage
because I have acne I have scarring you
guys know what my skin looks like I need
a good full coverage foundation and this
is 100% what it claims to be I probably
use a little bit more than the average
person they say that you need about
three to four drops for your full face
if you want full coverage I don't know
how much I use because I just kind of
spread it on in both shades you guys
will see how much I use but that's what
gives me the coverage that I like I
don't think you can get more full
coverage in this this literally covers
up everything if you don't want
completely full coverage you can always
share this down with a moisturizer or BB
cream this is probably the most full
coverage foundation I've ever tried the
cap on D lock-it tattoo foundation comes
pretty close but the finish of this is
not even comparable this looks like it's
a normal lightweight concealer it looks
pretty much like skin definitely looks
like you're wearing makeup because your
face is so flawless but as far as the
finish it doesn't look like a full
coverage heavy foundation at all so now
going into the demo as far as how it
applies with both a brush and a makeup
sponge I prefer this elf brush over
anything I've tried not sure if you can
fully tell on camera but the brush eye
does give better coverage totally fine
blending out with a makeup sponge but I
just prefer the brush side better if you
want to shoot it out a little bit and
you don't want as full of coverage the
sponge will be a good option for you I
just mix it directly on my face I just
like how that applies the best because
then I can see like in real time as I'm
kind of blending it out with my finger
if I need to add more light or more dark
to it it feels very lightweight but
creamy blend out really easily does dry
quick so you have to work fast rush
bronzer everything stays on great on top
of this foundation at the end of the day
all that is still completely on the
finish of it is a really nice satiny I
would say it's a satin matte finish I
love the finish of it I think it's
beautiful I do not powder my face at all
when I use this you don't need to it
stays on all day doesn't get oily on my
skin especially if I use in oil
controlling primer underneath 9 out of
10 foundations break me out I am so
happy that this is not one of those
foundations this doesn't make my acne
worse overall my only complaints with
this foundation is the applicator and it
does transfer so if you're hugging
someone or if the other day is wearing a
jacket and I like turn
my head and it got the foundation got on
the jacket right here on the collar so
it does transfer powder it and might not
transfer as much I'm not sure having
tried that out even though it transfers
it doesn't look like it comes off your
face if that makes sense if you put your
hand on your face you might get some
foundation on your fingers but it's not
gonna like come off the side of your
face which is nice and I know how that
works but it does
overall should you buy this foundation
personally I am super happy with it I
said I've been using this for a couple
weeks and I'm going to continue to use
it and test out different ways to mix
this foundation if you have the $55 to
spend and you want a good long-lasting
full coverage foundation go for it if
you guys like this video and it was
helpful for you give it a thumbs up so I
know let me know down below in the
comments what foundation do you guys
