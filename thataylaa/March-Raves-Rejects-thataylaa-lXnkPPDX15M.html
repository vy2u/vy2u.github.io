comment down below if you've been with
me long enough to remember this
background and the ugly doll that has
not moved this is my first time home in
seven months sitting on a basket ugly
doll in the background janky mirror set
up behind you guys welcome home my ass
hurts so bad so today we have March
raves and rejects I don't think I've
ever uploaded a rape sin rejects video
on the actual first of the new month
before this turns into a like vlog let's
just get into it I guess I'll start with
the foundation that I'm wearing right
now and it's the Maybelline shinin free
foundation the fit me stick and this is
in the shade 110 ivory I couldn't find
this for the longest time because in my
college town they didn't carry the
lightest shade but here they did
obviously that's basically a foundation
stick that just rolls up and you just
you know put it on I blend it out with a
brush if you want to see how this
applies I do have a get ready with me
video that I will link right here I
don't know if it's just because this is
actually light enough for my skin and
that's why I like it but I do like the
consistency if you have oily skin you
don't want to use this I don't believe
in the whole shine free claim I noticed
that I start getting pretty shiny around
my nose area especially when I wear this
I don't mind it because I just powder up
and it's light enough for my skin I
guess I should just mention the next two
favorites that are also in my get ready
with me video the first is the elf matte
eyeshadow in brick I think this is
pretty comparable to Mac's Brown script
so if you like warm brown tones and this
would be perfect is what I'm wearing in
my crease right now and then the other
favorite that's also in my get ready
with me video is the Physicians Formula
things shimmer brick what is this even
cold this is the warm nude shade I think
there's one other shape this is awesome
because you can use it for your eyes or
your face whatever you're feeling I did
Bo
and they get ready with me video that
has these really light shades up here
has some pings for blush and then you
can also contour with these or use it in
your crease on your eye like I did today
and can we just look at the packaging
come on Physicians Formula lately
husband on their packaging game my next
rave I don't think I've mentioned this
in any of my rapes or rejects videos
lately but this has been my like go-to
blush every single day for the last like
three months I want to say wet'n wild
pearlescent pink blush if you have pale
skin I would definitely recommend this I
just find that it really like
complements my fair skin it's pretty
matte for the most part it looks like
there's a tiny bit of shimmer in the pan
but when you put it on your face it
looks completely matte these are like
two dollars at the drugstore probably my
favorite blush of all time oh here's the
brush that I apply the fit me stick with
this has also been a favorite it is the
stigma around kabuki f82
brush I always hear people talking about
the f80 and I really like the f80 but
also the f82 is freaking amazing
I think there's certain foundations that
this definitely works better on for
example the fit me stick this just
blends it out flawlessly I think if you
want a more full coverage let the f82
does a better job because it is a little
bit more compact pretty dense yeah I
can't believe I forgot to mention this
in my last raisin Rejects video because
I am obsessed with it it is the
Physicians Formula
eye booster two and one lash boosting
eyeliner and serum it's basically just
an eye liner it has a I can't even
describe the tip it's kind of like a
brush it makes it so easy to achieve a
wing because it has a very fine point at
the end it doesn't smudge it doesn't
fade throughout the day I don't think
I'll ever use another liner so I kind of
rediscovered this lipstick this month it
is Revlon's lipstick in pink pout it
used to be one of my favorites I don't
know how it disappeared but it's back in
my life
it is this like muted matte pink color I
not tell you how beautiful it looks it
looks like your lips but better if
you're into the whole YouTube world I'm
sure you've heard of these but I haven't
tried them until like a week ago I'll
insert a picture right here of what mine
loved like I got these for my Vegas trip
and I don't know I just didn't want to
spend like 30 bucks on a manicure but I
wanted my nails to be looking good for
Vegas you know I mean so I went and got
these and I think they were like between
five and seven dollars they have tons of
cute designs and since they are press-on
I was kind of skeptical I thought they
might just pop off after a day or two
they lasted me six days and at that
point I got bored of them so I peeled
them off I don't know how long they
would have lasted but I was so surprised
not one of them popped off I will
definitely be repurchasing these my last
rave of the month is my hair color and
it's the L'Oreal Paris black sapphire
superior preference just thinking about
making a video about my kind of hair
changes this past couple months because
if you've been following my Instagram
you've probably seen them all I don't
really know what happened I got really
bored with black and then I wanted to go
red and then I wanted to go like purple
and it was just it was an interesting
experience and now we're back to black
clearly so what I wanted was kind of a
blue-black I didn't want it to be like
holy that girl has blue in her hair
kind of black I just wanted like a cool
undertone of blue in my black dye and
this was perfect it does pretty much
look exactly like the picture shows made
my hair super shiny feels so much
healthier now always
like myself I have black hair
happy with it once you go black you
never go back Neutrogena ageless
intensives deep wrinkle eye cream oh you
might be like you're 21 what are you
doing putting like wrinkle cream on your
eyeball I'm already getting like crow's
feet or whatever it's called and I just
just want to stop it before it happened
so I did some Amazon research and this
one got really good reviews and I don't
know why I've been using this for about
three months now so you know I should be
seeing some kind of results at this
point I know that I creams tend to take
a while for you to see an effect people
are saying that within a month they saw
the effects of this I don't know what
the hell they're talking about maybe
mine they're just like super deep and
beyond repair which would be really
 great because I'm only 21 but
yeah I just didn't see a difference and
I also don't like the consistency of
this if you like really thin eye creams
you'd probably like this but I wanted
something that I could like feel and
feel working or something this just
wasn't giving it to me
if you know of a good eye cream or cream
for like wrinkle prevention or whatever

love you forever if you like raves and
