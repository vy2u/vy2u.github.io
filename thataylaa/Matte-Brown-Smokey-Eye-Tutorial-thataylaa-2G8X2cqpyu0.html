to get this matte brown smokey eye this
has been one of my go-to looks lately I
love it so I'm gonna show you guys how
to do it let's do this
so I'm gonna start off by priming my
eyes like always with Mac's painterly
paint-pot this is gonna serve as a base
square eyeshadows to stick and then
taking this light matte brown shade from
the it's Judy's time pallet I'm gonna be
putting this on a fluffy brush and
blending this into the crease as a
transition color it's my favorite
transition color I use this pretty much
every single day I'm using the 28
palette by morphe brushes calm I love
these eyeshadows using this like coppery
warm brown color these are so pigmented
so amazing if you haven't tried more if
I would highly recommend it their I
shadow czar two dollars a pan which is
incredible and I'm just patting them on
with my finger now to give it even more
pigmentation and then taking Mac's Brown
script I'm going to be applying this
with kind of like a C like a Mac 215
brush I guess you call it into the
crease to give it a little more
dimension this is my favorite shade Mac
has ever made ever it is amazing if you
don't own it you need it in your life
then I'm going to be taking an empty
fluffy blending brush and just blending
all this out because no one likes
unblended eyeshadow can I get an amen
now I'm taking this matte chocolate
brown shade by morphe as well and I'm
putting this in the outer V and then
blending it inwards a little bit mostly
focusing it on the outside of my eye and
now we're going back and blending again
how fun I'm going to take this really
small C shader brush and go back in the
itch Judy's time soft brown color and I
have been loving putting this on the
bottom lashline lately and then I'm
taking brown script again on a liner
brush and putting this mostly on the
outer third of my eye
then I'm gonna go in with Mack stubborn
brown liner and line my waterline and
then use morphs gel liner and black
which is amazing it's super black as you
can see I really really like this stuff
so this is what our eyes look like now
that the liner is on I'm gonna be going
in with Mac's prep and prime lash primer
I didn't realize how much my head moved
when I put on mascara so I had to kind
of put it in slow mo these l'oréal's
carbon black mascara on the top and then
wet and wilds mega length mascara for
the bottom lashes and that's it for the
eyes for the lips I'm using Rimmel's
Kate Moss lipstick in 0-8 you will see
