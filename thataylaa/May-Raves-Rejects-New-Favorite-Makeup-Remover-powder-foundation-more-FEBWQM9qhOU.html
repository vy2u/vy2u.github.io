burrito all right so today we have May
raves and rejects
I've been sick in bed for the last three
days not interacting with outside world
or talking to anyone so this video
should be interesting
May is over weird alright let's just
jump into it
my first rave of the month is this CVS
brand offend pro results thermal
protection spray and finishing spray
when I went to New Orleans last month
was that already a month ago holy crap
by the way I freaking miss beignets I
didn't bring any of my hair products
because I figured my mom would and she
did the same thing so we're both out of
hair products so we went to CVS and
picked this up and you just spray it on
before you apply heat to your hair I
like a few different things about this
one it comes in an aerosol spray cans so
it's just easier to distribute evenly
across your hair second it smells
freakin amazing it smells super sweet
and fruity so if you're not about that
then you probably wouldn't like this
I love the smell not that I can smell
anything right now the other thing I
like is that you can also you can also
use it as a finishing spray so you don't
need two different products this kind of
is like a two-in-one kind of deal when I
use it as a finishing spray it just
makes my hair super shiny and smell good
and up and liking this if you're from
Washington let me know if you have found
a CVS in the state because I don't think
they exist my next rave which I am super
excited to tell you guys about because I
feel like this is kind of like a hidden
gem product the moisture white shisho
shiso makeup cleansing oil and this is
from bathroom no from the body shop the
body shop was having this like crazy
sale online buy three get three free I
had to pick up some of my tea tree oil
products so I figured I would try this
out I've been obsessed with the Garnier
makeup removing lotion for a bit now and
that one does leave a little bit of a
residue like you have to wash it off
with a washcloth or face wash afterwards
this is amazing I put a tiny drop of
this on my hands with a full face of
makeup eye makeup and everything and
just rub it into my skin and it
literally dissolves everything away and
when I first put this on it felt super
oily and I thought it was going to be
one of those products that leaves a like
oily residue which I freaking hate I
don't know how they did this but once
you put water on your face and start
washing it away
it really makes your skin feel like
squeaky clean no oil left over no makeup
no black around my eyes like nothing it
literally takes off everything if you're
looking for a product that's just gonna
take off all of your makeup in one swipe
no step you need this in your life go to
the body shop and buy this right now my
next rave is the it cosmetics
celebration foundation illumination in
the shade fair this is a powder
foundation that gives you a luminous
kind of finish I don't use this by
itself I use it to set my makeup if
you're someone who doesn't like to use
powder because you don't like the finish
that it goes get this stuff it has super
nice coverage it gives your face like a
super natural kind of luminous look fair
does match me pretty well it's a little
bit yellow on my skin but it's doable
I've just been enjoying this to set my
foundation I've been using this every
day for the last like two months
probably a freaking obsessed with it
like that's all I can say about this so
if you follow me on Instagram which is
the same as my youtube name you'll see
that I kind of went through this phase
this month where I wanted blue hair I
still want blue hair I want like a super
deep dark blue that looks almost black
but it's still visibly blue which is
really hard to achieve I learned I did
get close just the dye that I put over
top literally turned my hair black but
when I was lightening my hair I used the
one and only color fix and this is just
from Sally's and it's a haircolor
remover so it basically strips all the
layers of color and dye from your hair
I've used a few different color removals
over the years and this one worked
amazing I'll insert a picture right here
but it literally got my hair to like
almost my natural color like a
strawberry blonde ish Brown if you're
looking to lighten your hair and you
don't want to bleach it and you're gonna
put a dye or toner or something overtop
try out this color remover my hair was
not damaged at all it felt totally fine
and it's way healthier for your hair
than bleached next is this Rimmel
scandaleyes waterproof this is in the
shade at 0-5 nude and this is basically
just a nude eyeliner that you can get at
the drugstore I put it in my waterline
I'm wearing it right now and it just
helps to brighten up your eyes and make
you look more awake I always have red
eyes for some reason
at work when I'm like staring at a
computer for eight hours my eyes get
super red and bloodshot and I feel like
this just helps to make me look not as
like scary and bright red it's not as
intense as putting like a white eyeliner
on your waterline but it does help to
just make you look more alive next we
have the soap &amp;amp; Glory righteous butter
this is a body butter I feel like I've
heard people talk about this for years
and they always mentioned how amazing it
smells you can't even begin to imagine
how amazing this smells unless you go
and smell it seriously is like fun real
it smells super clean fresh and amazing
and something that you want to put on
your body when you get out of the shower
it is a pretty thick body butter so it
makes your skin it feels super
moisturize and nice afterwards they also
like to use this on my arms in the
morning because it kind of acts as like
a perfume as well the scent lingers
throughout the day and it stays on which
I really like when I run out of this I
will definitely be repurchasing it
because it is freakin amazing alright I
have a few lip products here that I'm
just gonna attempt to power through the
first one I'm wearing on my lips right
now and this is the essence 11 in the
nude lip liner this is just a nude liner
I love the essence lip liners they go on
super smooth they're like a dollar 50
and every one I've tried so far I really
enjoyed and this is just the perfect
dark nude but not where it's like too
dark or too light my favorite two to
pair it with is color pop cookie and
color pop skimpy I'll swatch these for
you guys cookie is almost a identical
match to it and then skimpy is a little
bit lighter but it makes your lips look
bigger if you just put a little bit of
skimpy in the middle so here's what they
look like here's the liner and then here
just cookie and skimpy right there I've
basically been wearing a combo with this
liner every single day this month right
now I'm wearing Ted I think it's cold no
ace right now I'm wearing color pop ace
over top which is one of their new ones
and it looks really pretty I actually
really like this combo people always ask
where you can buy essence products I get
them at Fred Meyer they usually have
insane essence sections like the biggest
ones I've ever seen Ulta also carries
essence usually have a lot less stuff
and it's always like super picked
through I feel like but yeah that's
where you can get it the NYC plumping
lip gloss big bold
whatever this isn't
shade pleasantly plump pink I think this
came in like an influencer box or
something years ago probably two years
ago this thing is literally ginormous
like my hand wraps around the entire
thing and look at this one this is kind
of strange this reminds me of the
Clinique
two-in-one foundation or whatever it's
called wand like look at this thing
bigger than my entire lip anyways this
is one of those products that I've had
sitting in my drawer for like years and
a couple months ago I just decided to
put it on for some reason it is like my
perfect lip gloss consistency it's not
sticky at all you don't even notice that
it's on your lips it makes you kind of
look like you have vaseline on your lips
like it looks super natural it's kind of
sheer it's not super pink and you can
literally put it over any lip
combination sometimes I'll put it just
on top of the essence liner I've put
this on top of la splash glish and it
just looks great on top of anything
literally sweating moles right now can't
tell if I have a few right now or if
this light is just really freaking hot
if you're just running out the door and
putting on like minimal makeup this
looks amazing I've just been really
enjoying this and this is like a dollar
or two dollars from the drugstore I have
two rejects this month the first is
China Glaze
flip-flop fantasy the color of it is
amazing but I put it on my toes and I
kid you not within 24 hours it literally
started chipping off my toes I used the
same top coat I always use I don't know
what's going on with China Glaze does
this chip for you guys because it was
kind of read it
this month is the elf baked highlighter
in the shade pink diamonds it looks
super pretty in the pan but when you put
it on your face it is like the most
disgusting chalky finish I don't even
know if you guys can tell in there but
it literally just like looks and feels
like chalk when you blend it into your
skin it kind of just goes away and
doesn't do anything save your dollar put
it towards a burrito
