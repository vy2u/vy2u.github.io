that time of the month I know we usually
talk about how fast the month went by
but this one isn't even funny because I
graduate in literally 15 days a little
bit stressed right now so we'll see how
this video goes but I wanted to get it
up for you guys I feel like I have a lot
to talk to you guys about just like
things going on my life right now I'm
gonna be doing another get ready shadow
and schmooze video coming soon
explaining everything and filling you
guys in let's just start also got henna
in Seattle last weekend you're supposed
to wash it off after two hours I decided
not to do that fell asleep with my hand
somehow on my armpit slash my eyeball
and now I have a second henna tattoo
right here it'll look great in
graduation pictures so let's just start
I'm going to start with the two
foundations that I've been obsessed with
this month the first is like a throwback
bone back to the high school days this
is the Revlon Colorstay foundation in
110 ivory and this is the combination
oily skin one this fly has been
flying around in my room for like a week
now
I forgot how amazing of a lasting power
this stuff has it literally lasts all
day if you have oily skin or your makeup
starts to break out throughout the day
on your skin I would definitely
recommend trying a Revlon Colorstay also
this foundation I don't even have to mix
in my Manic Panic dreamtone this is
light enough it's almost too light tends
to look a little bit ghostly on my skin
so I like to use a blush or even like a
little bit of bronzer with this stuff
but just has a really great lasting
power and coverage and I forgot how much
I liked it my next foundation you could
probably guess if you saw my review but
this is the covergirl Ready Set gorgeous
foundation this stuff is amazing this is
part of their new Ready Set gorgeous
line if you want to hear my whole
thoughts and I do have a review video
but basically it just gives you the best
natural kind of finish but still gives
you that coverage that
my next favorite of the month it is the
Maybelline falsies mascara holy crap you
guys I can't believe I ever did not like
this basically this mascara has a pretty
wet formula almost like the L'Oreal
carbon black but it has this curved
brush so I am going to be doing a video
on the way I apply this because you guys
wanted to see this but this curved brush
just makes it really easy to like work
this into your eyelashes almost in
create that curve I love this mascara
I've been using this everyday for like
the past three weeks now I have had zero
urge to use my L'Oreal carbon black
which is like a huge statement for me to
say because that has been my baby for
like five years
this is my new child my next two
favorites are what I've been using for
concealers the first is Revlon
age-defying targeted dark spot concealer
and this has a sponge tip applicator
which I absolutely hate I don't know
when companies are gonna get the memo
that people hate these sponge things
it's just really unsanitary and
unnecessary in all aspects but I just
squeeze it on the back of my hand and
then I mix in a little bit of the NYX HD
photogenic concealer in lavender reason
I do that is because this concealer the
lightest shade is still a little bit too
dark so I must mix in a little bit of a
purple concealer to get it at the right
shade for my skin tone but if you're not
super fair this will work perfect on its
own this stuff is amazing it doesn't
crease gives you really nice coverage
feels creamy really have nothing bad to
say about this product other than this
sponge my next rave of the month is the
essence gel tint in 0-2 deep red I wore
this in my first drugstore haul where I
talked about it I've been wearing this
pretty much on a daily basis I wear this
going to class and it doesn't look like
too much but it still gives me a little
bit of color in my lips the thing about
the gel tints if you're looking for
something that's going to actually tint
your lips or like a lip stain this
product isn't gonna be for you what I do
like about it is that it gives you this
super pretty natural kind of like it
looks like you just kind of ate a
popsicle you know it has this doe foot
applicator which is actually a pretty
stiff so it's not too difficult to get
that shape of your lips that so
be perfect for summer with like a BB
cream and cream blush or something it
definitely doesn't stain your lips or
anything like that it's not very
long-lasting when I wear this stuff I do
apply it like every couple hours that's
okay for me because I really really like
the color
my next favorite of the month is the
it's Judy's time I shadow palette you
can get this off of BH Cosmetics it's
super affordable it's like $15 a lot of
people commented on my Rimmel stay
blushed video saying that they wanted an
eye tutorial and this is the palette
that I used to create that look it has
one two three four five matte shades and
then the rest are like shimmery this
shade is probably my favorite it's
perfect for the crease darker shimmery
shades in here has like a gold just been
reaching for this palette a lot this
month and if you are someone that
doesn't want to spend a lot of money on
an eyeshadow palette but you want the
quality and I would definitely recommend
getting this baby and I also think it's
really cool just to support beauty gurus
I think it's awesome when people can get
to that point where they have their own
product like how freaking cool is that
that Judi has her own eyeshadow palette
I think that's amazing congrats Judi a
little bit of deep moment my last room
of the month is the benefit
Porefessional primer so I have the mini
ass version not about to spend like $25
on a primer so I wanted to try this out
because obviously it's like the talk of
the town on YouTube I definitely
definitely think that this is worth the
hype this does an amazing job of hiding
your pores I have pretty big pores
around my nose and I noticed that my
foundation goes on that so much smoother
so much better with this stuff I don't
think it really helps the lasting power
of your foundation if you're looking for
a primer to help your foundation stay on
longer I would go with L'Oreal magic
Lumi but this one really helps with the
pores if you're curious about this stuff
like I was I would definitely recommend
just trying out the tiny version if you
like it if you don't want to get the
bigger version so I actually have a
couple rejects this month that I feel
very strongly about a couple days ago I
posted an updated facebook status about
this product at next invincible fullest
coverage foundation so I use this and
they get ready with me video
and the thing about this foundation is
that it looks amazing on camera I don't
know how I don't know why it looks so
much better on camera than it looks in
real life the real life it looks like

comes in a squeeze tube which means that
it is super thick it doesn't
blend out well at all
it's heavy it feels like I just
literally painted my face with thick ass
paint it does have a good coverage I'll
give it that
and it does look good on camera would
not recommend anyone buying this unless
you do booty videos but the thing is
even when I wear this in a video I
literally will wipe off my face
afterwards watch my face and then put on
a different foundation like that's how
absolutely disgusting and heavy it feels
on your face I really wanted to like
this foundation and I really don't next
reject of the month which was kind of
surprising to me these are the kiss
peel-off gel dress nail stickers and I'm
wearing them on my tips right now
they're like these galaxy nail stickers
they look really cool but what the hell
kiss these weren't five dollars they're
half the price of Sally Hansen's nail
stickers or whatever which now I know
why first of all they come in these
little strips they're so freakin
difficult to peel off of the actual
strip I think it took me literally
probably 20 to 30 minutes with the help
of my roommate to peel off these damn
stickers the other thing is that they're
so much thicker than the Sally Hansen
ones that in order to file it off
smoothly it takes a lot of freaking
skill I still have like the bits and
pieces like coming off on the ends
because they're just too thick to file
off they're also really wide so you have
to somehow manage to like file off the
side on your freaking skin I don't know
also they're all like the same freaking
size like who has five nails that are
all this big tell me that so that was my
main reason rejects video I feel like I
didn't have that much stuff this month
but the things that I mentioned I truly
truly love and have been wearing all
month pretty much with the exception of
the benefit Porefessional which I've
been using for like the last week ish
love it if you
like this video and it was helpful for
you be sure to give it a thumbs up so I
know if I went down below with any
questions that you guys want me to
answer in my next shadow and shmoo this
video that's coming up because I just
feel like I have a lot to talk about and
a lot to tell you guys about a lot of
questions to answer from previous videos
I've been keeping a like notepad thing
in my phone with all of your guys's
questions that I need to answer so I'm
going to be answering all of those in
that video so stay tuned for that
love you guys thanks for watching and
see you in my next video bye
