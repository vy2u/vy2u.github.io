doing a first impression style video on
the Nisha magic cushion BB cream CC BB
what is this no BB no CC magic cushion
SPF 50 foundation the great start to the
video you can get this off of Amazon for
$7.99 free shipping hell yeah
couple of you guys have tweeted me this
saying that you want a review and I
finally checked it out and I got it and
I'm excited by the way if you have any
foundations you ever want me to review
you can tweet me snap me comment down
below let me know I'll order it so this
product has 4.1 stars on Amazon and it
has 176 reviews and not a whole lot of
info on there but I'm going to read you
what they do have says it's a magic
cushion with perfect coverage to help
achieve flawless skin and long-lasting
makeup it has silica bead powder which
is supposed to help absorb sweat and
sebum helping the makeup to last longer
has bamboo water fruit extract leaves
your skin moisturize has hazel extract
lots of extracts extracts it doesn't
actually say what kind of coverage is
supposed to be but does say that's
supposed to be lightweight and buildable
coverage and it has SPF 50 which
freaking rocks so get skin cancer okay
so it's pretty much what it says on
Amazon I'm going to leave a link to the
product down below so you can go check
it out and actually tell how many
different shades I have but I think they
only have a few so if you want to see
how this foundation applies and where's
throughout the day and be checking in
throughout the whole night you're in the
right place just keep watching also if
you're new here don't forget to
subscribe I do a ton of foundation
videos first impression videos videos
for pale skin lots of good stuff join
the baby doe family and subscribe
alright so on my face right now all I
have on is a moisturizer this is the
shade shisei dough can't say that brin
Shiseido Ibuki multi solution gel I
mentioned this in my razor rejects video
like I'm gonna sneeze come on where you
at I love it for underneath foundation
I've been using a primer at all I've
just been using that gel and it serves
as a really nice base and moisturizes my
skin and my skin right now just to give
you guys a little bit of an update or
you're new to my channel okay my stinky
bras like falling off my boobs right now
my skin is actually doing really well
right now I was just in Tahoe so I feel
like it helped to dry out a lot of my
acne I don't actually have any open acne
spots right now this is all basically
scarring I have obviously some texture
from them healing and stuff if you've
been following my videos you know that's
actually pretty good for my skin we're
gonna see how well this cushion covers
up this isn't a shade 21 and it has SPF
50 which is really nice for summertime I
do still have a little bit of fake tan
on right now leftover from the spray tan
for when I went to Tahoe so I figured it
would be a good time to test out this
cushion I've kind of been putting it off
because it looks pretty dark so I'm
hoping now that I have a little bit of
tan going on it might match my neck
hopefully also a little bit sunburned so
that was fun so comes in this box only
open this to see the shade before I've
never actually used it this is what it
looks like it's actually pretty bulky
packaging like this pretty big pop this
guy open so it comes with a little
sponge thing on top and this is actually
an interesting sponge just like super
soft feels more like foam and then you
pop open this thing and whenever you
have a cushion foundation you want to
make sure that you fully closed this or
else the air is going to get in and dry
it out and I do have a review on one
other cushion foundation the L'Oreal
cushion magic lumi foundation so I'll
link that down below so here's the shade
looks pretty dark for my normal pale
self but I think it might hopefully be
okay though on Amazon there was a whole
lot of information on how to apply this
so I'm going to do it just like normal
with this cushion foundation where you
just kind of do the roll Pat motion and
then we also have a brush here and a
Beauty Blender just in case that doesn't
work out I do brush on one side and the
cushion on the other side so I'm just
going to go to town put some product on
here hmm
what
okay so first thoughts just on this half
of my face that covered way better than
I was expecting it to the shade is
actually like perfect for my shade of
skin right now super impressed with the
coverage I would definitely say this is
medium coverage you can still see scars
the stuff peeking through it does say
supposed to be buildable so I think with
the second layer we'll get it to
hopefully a full coverage it does have a
strong smell smells like their Bath and
Body Works candle or like some kind of
lotion I own doesn't smell like SPF
though which is nice so here is no
foundation versus the sidewith
foundation again so far like and it has
a really nice luminous dewy finish think
we're going to try and do the Beauty
Blender for the other side so I'm just
going to go ahead and dip the end of my
sponge in the sponge it's okay
already that's Waymar sheer coverage so
if you're just looking for a little bit
of coverage yeah if you're just looking
for a light coverage try it with a
Beauty Blender let's try a brush dip in
the brush straight in there the brush is
giving better coverage on the Beauty
Blender not as good as this sponge
applicator and I feel like I'm using a
lot more product with the brush so I'm
going to go back in with that sponge and
with the cushion foundation you want to
do these kind of rolling patting motions
you don't want to rub it or it's just
going to rub the product off so that's
one layer I'm going to add a tiny bit
more product and see how buildable this
is feel like that added a little bit
more coverage I definitely love the
finish of this I think it's a nice kind
of natural look well it still gives
coverage and by natural I mean just the
finish of it doesn't look like I'm
wearing a ton of makeup on my face I
will say that around my nose it's
already starting to crease a little bit
and with this applicator it is difficult
to get in there alright so it is now
1:45 p.m. a little bit late in the
afternoon so I literally just landed in
Seattle got home haven't even unpacked
started filming so I'm going to keep
this foundation on as long as I can I'm
about to film makeup looks which will
take me like another hour to an hour and
a half so I'll probably check in at the
end of that so you guys can see what it
looks like once all my makeup is on that
will be
right back okay I have no idea how it's
already three o'clock but it is
apparently I was filming for two hours
seriously last time we checked with
12:40 but right no idea how two hours
just one by but I just filmed an
Instagram video and to get ready with me
video on the look I'm wearing right now
that'll be up before this video most
likely so I'll link it in the
description box down below so you guys
can go check it out if you want to see
how I did this makeup I'm trying to get
into like Instagram videos and it's
really hard to film those at the same
time as like a talk-through shadow news
video so I'm going to be switching off
between those and get ready with me
videos or just music anyways the makeup
so it's been on for two hours apparently
now and it looks pretty dang good
I actually didn't set it we might set
the forehead right now because it looks
a little bit dewy it's not greasy or
anything it doesn't feel greasy at all
it just looks the same as when I first
applied it pretty doing which I
personally like after a while I'll
probably get oily that's usually what
tends to happen I don't know if I said
it but I have combination skin as far as
how blush bronzer everything applied on
top blend it out super easily for not
having any kind of powder for sure
sometimes you get that sticky feeling
when you try to put powder products on
top of liquid foundation without setting
your face and that didn't happen which
I'm really happy about I do notice
though that if you touch your face it's
pretty much going to come off I
personally like touch my finger to the
middle of my forehead and the foundation
like totally rubbed off there so I had
to apply a little bit more but that
probably wouldn't happen as easily if
you set your face then I'm gonna wait
till one more second to powder my face
just so I can see how it holds up
without powder so far no complaints
Ashley's looking good around the nose my
skin looks like skin it has good
coverage we will check back throughout
the night totally didn't think through
the whole glitter on the eyeballs and
wig thing during your first impression
usually I like change clothes and get
comfy throughout first impressions but
it looks like we're going to be wearing
this for a while alright it is now 8:40
2 p.m. so the Foundation's been on for
almost exactly 8 hours if you think of
your day in terms of hours it's like
really bizarre I had to ditch the false
lashes because my eyes are like killing
me they still are so the Revlon lash
glue is a No add that to the pile I'm
pretty proud of myself for keeping the
wig and glitter
and everything on all day over all
thoughts I am totally pleasantly
surprised by this haven't had good
experiences with cushion foundations in
the past and I didn't have super high
hopes for this but I am totally
pleasantly surprised I realized that I
didn't use a setting spray at all either
I use a setting spray almost every
single day and the fact that I didn't
use a primer and I didn't use a setting
spray or a setting powder and my face
still looks this good is amazing do you
feel like I'm starting to break out in
certain spots so I hope that's not
because of this product with the ring
light on is definitely like reflecting
the light a bit more so I look more oily
than I do in real life not oily though
like not a whole lot comes off on my
finger when I do that right here in my
forehead are definitely a little bit
shiny I'm sure if I use a setting spray
and put a little powder on it would be
totally fine blush bronzer highlight
stayed on amazing like it looks like I
just applied it pretty much the only
thing I know this is a little bit of
settling around my nose no smile lines
which is great sometimes I get the lines
right here definitely try this again I'm
curious to see if this shade will work
when I'm fair or my face feels really
nice and like moisturized if you have
dry skin this might be a good product
seeing how it's a bit do even when I
first applied it if you have oily skin
not sure if this is the right thing for
you but it might be different if you try
and set it with powder or $7.99 on
Amazon I say try it nice job Misha if
you guys liked this video give it a
thumbs up so I know let me know down
below with what products you want to see
your first impression on I did pick up
the L'Oreal infallible Pro glow
foundation so this is going to be coming
up I just had to wait til I get super
pale again though in a few days when my
tan is gone especially lasting a long
time like I thought be gone right now
that's interesting so this is medium
coverage okay anyways few days when I'm
back to my pale self we will try this
guy out love you guys thanks for
watching see my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
