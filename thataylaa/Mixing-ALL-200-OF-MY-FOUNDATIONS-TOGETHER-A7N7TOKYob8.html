video right now
all right so as you can see from the
title of this video when we are doing
this today I'm going to be mixing
together all of my foundations I've seen
a few of these videos so far and
everyone's mixing their foundations and
like a cute little petri dish we've got
a huge-ass bowl folks this is like the
type of bowl I make my Red Lobster
cheesy biscuits in this video idea was
started by Sofia Nygaard she's first one
who did this and it's been kind of going
around the YouTube world since then I
love Sophia's channel she's a video
genius and she's just hilarious and
seems like a cool girl so if you're not
subscribed to her channel I'm elated to
be his video down below
I actually was pretty set on not doing
this video because of the ridiculous
amount of foundations that I do have as
it's been kind of making its Browns I'm
kind of curious and also a ton of
you guys have been asking for this video
give the people what they want so I
actually have zero idea how many
foundations exactly I own I'm gonna take
a guess you guys should take a guess in
the comments down below I know I have 5
pretty large containers and I'm gonna
guess that there's about 30 in each one
I'm gonna say I have a hundred 47 that
sounds like a good number to me leave
your guesses in the comments down below
but I actually have about 40 more
foundations that I haven't reviewed yet
so I'm not including those in this video
these are just the ones that I have
already opened and tried so if you're
excited for this video don't forget to
give it a thumbs up if you're new here
you can join the bay Rito family and
subscribe I upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time and
if you're wondering why I have hundreds
of foundations one I have a foundation
addiction problem - I do foundation
Friday on my channel every single Friday
I also do a series called 15 days of
foundation which is the series where I
review 15 foundations in a row so if I
didn't do youtube I obviously don't
think I would have hundreds of
foundations hopefully so most of these
foundations I get to review for you guys
and even if I don't like a foundation I
still keep it and I have a couple bins
of foundations that I think are pure
 so don't think every single
foundation that I'm putting in this
concoction is one that I recommend
because it's definitely not you can
search the Tayla in the name of any of
these foundations pretty much and a
review video should pop up but I do keep
most the foundations that I don't like
some of them I'll donate but most of
them I keep for the sake of mentioning
and other videos trying out again mixing
with stuffs watching that kind of thing
by the way this is not a piece
the food it's a very well-made romwe $5
shirt and they just decided to stick a
piece of flour right there let's do this
I had oatmeal for breakfast I feel
pumped I feel ready to go ready to do
some mixing for a couple hours I have no
idea how long this is gonna take me I'm
gonna insert the time right when we
start so we can see how long it does
take me let's go mix and then I'll be
back right here to put this thing on my
face I'm going to try and put in about
the same amount of each product I also
have some foundations that I have a few
different shades in a challenges mixing
all the foundations you own so that's
what I'm gonna do I think the final
concoction might be a little bit
interesting because I would say about a
third of these I totally despise no idea
what this shade is gonna turn out like
some of these foundations are too light
for me some of them are way way way too
dark for me but I'm gonna show you guys
putting on this mixture and wearing it
throughout the day so if you watch my
videos you know I actually really enjoy
mixing foundations it's very difficult
to find one foundation that does
everything for you that you need it to
and is the exact right shade so in most
cases I usually mix foundations to make
them perfect for my skin it's really fun
to kind of experiment with and play
around with let me know if you guys want
to see a video on that my favorite
foundation cocktails I've been
mentioning that for a while but I still
want to do that video I think it'd be
really fun if you have multiple
foundations lying around try playing
around with them and mixing them because
you really never know how the finish is
gonna turn out it might be bomb it might
work really well for you
all right so that took about an hour and
ten minutes I have all my foundations in
here got like a boob stick foundation
right there I tried my best to get equal
amounts of everything some of them just
poured out some I was like spacing out
listening to a podcast so I'm gonna try
and mix all these up really well I have
a little fork here I'm gonna use this
because I feel like that might whisk
everything nicely all right we are back
from the laboratory it is now one
o'clock I took a quick chips and salsa
break and now I've never been more ready
but I think we have a nice consistency
going there's a little bit of chunks in
there but I tried to really mash them
all up and get it as smooth as I could
I've got a nice little drop going there
not too thick or thin so overall that
was that was a bit of a workout I would
say my right arm is a little bit sore
lots of chopping lots of squeezing lots
of whisking but I'm excited so I'm gonna
pin back my hair let the curls loose
today the cushion foundations were
probably the hardest to get out I kept
dropping the cushion in the bowl and
caps went flying it was quite the hour
by the way I haven't counted the amount
of foundations yet I'm gonna do that
right after this when I do the check-in
and natural lighting I'll tell you guys
the rod you washed and prepped my skin
like I usually do I'll link those
products down below what I use but I do
have my face with a brush this is a
helpful to my blending brush that's on
the other half a sponge so let's start
out with the brush on this side of my
face I just got way too much on the
palette I'm so excited oh I think the
shade is gonna be good
the shade in the bowl looks like it is
promising its gliding on really easily
way too much a right now going pretty
far it smells like a mix of the wet and
wild one like paint and gingerbread
cookies Cameron Bure which one of the
best foundation smells like gingerbread
but one of them has a super strong
gingerbread scent this is going really
far I'm just gonna keep spreading this
up to my forehead looking at my neck the
shade matches pretty well my ears are
always read so we can ignore that with
the brush it's not looking the best on
my forehead at all
but maybe we can smooth that out with
the sponge oh yeah it's looking pretty
bad on my nose and forehead oh okay it
seems to be kind of drying down so
before it totally dries down I'm gonna
go in with a sponge just move it out
there oh there we go
Wow that helped what that's definitely
helping to smooth it out there are some
areas where it doesn't seem to really
want to stick like around my nose area
doesn't look amazing on my forehead but
it also doesn't look horrible I'm gonna
do a sponge on the other side I'm gonna
try and use a little bit less product
because it does spread really far see
what kind of coverage we get on the
sponge side and I'm gonna zoom in in a
second and get really up close I never
do my eye makeup first this feels weird
looking very ghostly on camera it
doesn't look that ghostly in real life
so my forehead with the sponge on this
side definitely looks much less heavy
than the brush side it doesn't look too
bad at all like it actually looks kind
of good so it turned down the lights and
we're very zoomed in right now there are
certain areas where I don't love how it
looks like around my nose and the center
of my forehead right here looks a little
bit funky right there but it has a nice
radiant kind of glow to it I need to
touch up my brows I'm really glad
because my skin is on the drier side
normal to dry right now I'm on going in
month five vacutainer coverage I would
say got high medium low full coverage if
you look really up close see I mean you
can still see freckles and some redness
and stuff coming through but it did
cover my scarring for the most part and
I have a few breakouts down here right
now I was expecting this to look 50
times shittier just for the amount of
foundations I did mix in that are not my
favorite it looks pretty good right now
it's 116 I'm gonna apply the rest of my
makeup and I'll be right back okay so
it's now 150 we're gonna call a check-in
time 1:30 since that's about when I
finished up with my face makeup I did
set just this part of my face with my
usual Laura Geller it's what I do every
single day lately just so that my powder
products on top lend out easier but I am
I'm shocked I'm a little bit shocked I
wouldn't say it looks phenomenal like it
doesn't look as good
my favorite foundations look on my skin
it looks good enough to the point where
I would probably wear it again right now
we'll see how it wears throughout the
day I'm kind of curious how mixing
different bases like mixing oil and
water-based Foundation's how that's
gonna hold up throughout the day if
we're gonna get any kind of separation
if I were to wear this again I'd
definitely put on my Revlon pore filler
it's actually sitting right here
my poor reducing primer this is balm for
helping out with those pores and I do
feel like it's emphasizing that a bit
and on the center of my forehead and
it's also settling in a tiny bit to
align up here the makeup on the rest of
my face super quick I use the B ages OD
AK palette for my eyeshadows so bronzer
used the circa Champagne beach this is
actually a blush but it's a really warm
bronzer and then I kind of just tone it
down with face powder over top I went in
with a tiny bit of the jus a adore blush
duo this is so so freakin beautiful and
then this I haven't been able to put
down lately the EXO BD Aurora highlight
my eyelashes are pure which ones are
these deep I think yeah pure diva lashes
and then I put on the Physicians Formula
healthy lip in red storeit --iv effects
I'm going to go count all of these
foundations which are currently sitting
all over my kitchen and show you guys a
clip in natural lighting so here's what
the foundation looks like a natural
lighting looks pretty damn good I'm
gonna zoom in
so here's the forehead I was talking
about you can see the little crease
right there I don't even know what to do
with this I think I should get like a
pump bottle I wonder how much this would
fill up in a bottle - I'm about to count
all of these that are currently taking
over my entire kitchen I just finished
counting them all 206 foundations it was
just a little off I think I counted all
those correctly but give or take a few
either way pretty confident that there
were over 200 which is whoa I just
walked in foundation there's no escaping
it is now almost loops almost 11 o'clock
why am I having issues it's almost 11
o'clock right now it's been on for about
nine and a half hours and I got out the
camera at 9:30 do this I don't know what
I just did for an hour and half haven't
touched up my lipstick lashes are off
I'm breaking out don't know if it's from
this 200 foundations it looks okay from
far away let's zoom in doesn't look
horrible just definitely doesn't look
good enough right now to where I would
want to wear it again
okay so it kind of reminds me the way
the bear Pro sat on my skin the
bareMinerals bear Crowe I have a whole
video on that so as you can see it's
like creased quite a bit right on the
center of my forehead up here you can
still see the line it's still looking
better on camera I think it looks pretty
textured up there it looks a tad cakey
and then it's definitely rubbed off in
certain areas on my face I don't think
I've had my hand on my face a whole lot
today but yeah it's rubbed off in
certain areas still really don't like
how it looks around my nose I didn't get
any upper lip creasing so it's good but
I don't particularly like how it looks
around my nose I feel like it just
didn't stick to certain parts like look
it's almost completely off around my
pores overall I still think this was a
relatively positive experience
considering what we could have had with
206 foundations do I like it enough to
wear out wear it again probably not but
I think I am gonna put it in a pump and
I don't know project you sure do
this but I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I'm actually posting this tomorrow
so I got to start editing this right now
so I hope you guys liked saying whatever
just happened this is an experience I
will say that I have foundation on parts
of my apartment that the foundation
never even touched if you enjoyed this
