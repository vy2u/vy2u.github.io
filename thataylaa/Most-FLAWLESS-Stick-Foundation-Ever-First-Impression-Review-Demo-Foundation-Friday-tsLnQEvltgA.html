all right so today it is foundation
Friday favorite day of the week if
you're new here this is where I do a new
first impression video every single
Friday on my channel the next two weeks
we are actually not going to have a
foundation Friday video for the first
time because I am filming and getting
ready for 15 days of foundation 15 days
of foundation will be starting November
5th to the 19th I've been saying this
whole time the fifth to the 20th and
then someone commented on Facebook
saying that's actually 16 days you are
right math let's get onto the foundation
so today's videos on the Jolie cream
foundation stick you can get these off
of Amazon I've never heard anything
about these products basically just
ended up in the deep crevices of Amazon
found this stick foundation it had
really good reviews and everyone was
saying that it had amazing coverage at
two shades here at the shade porcelain
and pale beige I'm going to search
swatches right now so you can see these
two shades and in comparison with some
of the other foundations that I own
alright so swatch time here we have the
Jolie stick foundation in porcelain I
think this may be one of the darker
porcelains I've ever seen in my life
here we have pale beige ironically this
one looks more beige to me this is the
hourglass ik foundation the shade Blanc
this is the Maybelline fit me stick
foundation in 110 and then here we have
the golden rose stick foundation in 0-1
I've done a lot of stick foundation
reviews so I'm willing that playlist
down below also have a pale skin
playlist if you're new here I'm not
looking super pale today because this
product is like hella dark which you
will see so you can get this stick
foundation for 1360 free shipping with
prime you get 0.35 ounces of product
which is kind of in the middle the make
up forever stick foundation has zero
point four or four ounces it's that that
I now know this by memory the hourglass
foundation I believe had 0.25 this is
kind of in the middle size-wise I'm
going to read some of the claims on here
I couldn't find anything about this
brand a lot of people were saying that
this is the same as the Bobbi Brown
stick foundation just like the generic
version or whatever like the factory
version I don't know that is not a
confirm fact or anything that's just
what people are writing on Amazon a lot
of people are saying it's super similar
to that I haven't tried the Bobbi Brown
stick foundation so I
cannot give any input there but let's
read some of the claims on Amazon so
says it's a water-resistant cream
foundation rich creamy finish with
buildable coverage from sheer to opaque
even skin tone and hides imperfections
has a full velvety coverage for an
all-over face with a rich creamy finish
with the base same thing perfect for
correcting uneven complexions hyper
pigmentation or blemishes also works for
you as a concealer i've combination scan
with cystic acne my acne is actually
doing really well right now i gave you
guys a little bit of an update on my
acne situation in the demo i think
that's everything it says there is SPF 8
in here I did do a flash test so you'll
see if there just bounce back if you
guys liked this video and you're excited
for 15 days foundation make sure you
give it a thumbs up if you want to see
how this foundation applies and whereas
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching all right I'm
going to quickly prime my face with the
Joye anti blemish matte primer this is
what I've been using every day I love it
doesn't break me out I think it actually
might have kind of helped my skin my
skin is pretty dang clear for me right
now and it's been about 3 and 1/2 weeks
so I'm hoping it's staying like this but
a lot of questions about what I've
changed and I've actually gone off of
birth control I'm gonna be switching
birth controls so I don't know if that's
just coincidence timing or or what but
I've also taken a blood test for other
health stuff but they did test for
hormone levels so when I get that back
I'll know what's going on with my skin
and I wanted to do that before
accutane if I had to who need more
coffee okay I haven't swatched these
myself yet so I'm going to just watch
these two shades and see which one we
need to go with by the way I look way
darker on camera than I do in real life
I don't know what's going on maybe the
light closer it's making me look really
tan whoa that one is dark porcelain
looks really dark too it's just more of
like a beige though so I'm gonna go out
the shade porcelain I have my brush here
on one side this is the AOA f1 this is a
dollar kabuki brush obviously the
quality of like the glue and stuff is
probably not as good as Sigma but for
one dollar fricking works well now on
the other side I am so excited about
this look at this frickin bar
Boal Diamond sponge it's just so pretty
I don't even know if I'm going to use
this feel super soft just like the
original sponge so I'm going to do that
let's do them this side of my face and
then a brush on this side so I'm just
gonna actually find a sponge on the side
I'm going to go in like I normally would
with the stick foundation and hope that
this isn't super dark I might have to
change the settings on my camera cuz it
look really dark right now at least in
the viewfinder okay so I'm just gonna
attempt to blend and the cool thing
about this sponge is that it has this
like super fine point so you could get
really well under your eyes for
concealer and stuff so it has a flat
bottom edge there we go that looks a
little better I think so at least with
the sponge not the easiest one out it is
definitely way dark but at least it's
like a baiji tone so it doesn't look
orange alright so I just wanted to pop
in and give a little bit more
information about this sponge because I
kind of totally spaced I didn't use this
side at all so I'm just going to tell
you a little bit about this sponge and I
will use this in another upcoming
foundation video so we can really test
it out for this top side right here is
supposed to be for buffing out your
foundation all over your face is pretty
big so I feel like this would blend out
your foundation really quickly so these
smaller sides right here it says you can
work around your eyes mouth and brow
bone and then these larger flat size
which is what I use for foundation you
can use to apply pretty much anywhere
just as larger areas and then it has a
pointed tip that's supposed to cover
small imperfections you could also use
this as like under-eye concealers that
no two sponges are alike which is really
cool so each sponge has its own unique
little marbles oral design I just think
that's exciting
looks pretty matte but it looks nice on
the skin going with a brush on this side
and see what kind of coverage you get so
on this side I may actually go in with
the round AOA brush just because I feel
like round usually blends cream products
a little bit better this is the f4 also
a dollar it feels like it sets really
quick like you have to work pretty
quickly definitely got better coverage
with the brush side but the finish and
everything looks really nice it looks
like a nice soft matte finish it's just
really digging dark I don't know if you
guys will be able to see this but
here's my white self here's my face back
on the cannon by the way hallelujah so
there's no blur thing going on right now
this is my normal good camera before I
go in for a second layer on any parts
that we need it let's take a look up
close yeah it just looks really nice and
soft I would say by the way about medium
coverage off of that first layer there
we go
okay really good coverage on the second
layer that covered pretty much
everything
whoo that looks nice it feels pretty
lightweight too for a stick foundation
that has this kind of coverage it is
sticky to the touch though we'll see if
it sets or if it would have to kind of
set it with the powder but brush is
working really well to blend it out I'm
going to have a link down below along
with everything else I use and wear like
always
majorly blending this down my neck my
neck and my chest are literally two
entirely different colors right now
that's okay
maybe I should put on a turtleneck even
the viewfinder like my forehead right
now looks damn good I don't feel like I
need a ton of more coverage on my
forehead so I'm just going to do a
little tiny bit okay so this is the
coverage that we got with two layers
looks good I would say this is full
coverage just covered literally
everything on both of my cheeks I'm
gonna show you guys up close looks super
nice and smooth not a whole lot of
texture coming through at all really the
only areas that I can like see texture
coming through on my pores and I have
pretty big pores to start with way dark
here's my skin here's my fake skin so
we're gonna call the check-in time 8:45
I'm going to apply it the rest of my
makeup and do a check-in after that but
I'm filming a whole another video on the
look I'm about to do so we'll see how it
sets and stuff I have a feeling I don't
know I kind of don't want to ruin the
finish with the powder because it looks
so nice right now but I'm not sure if
I'll be able to blend oh it's starting
to set actually down here so I will
check back in with you guys after all my
makeup is on okay so it's now 1004 so
the Foundation's been on for a little of
for an hour I just want to show you guys
what it looks like with the rest of my
makeup on like I said it did a whole
video on this look that video will be up
next week not going to tell you
everything that's on my face right now
because there's going to be a whole
video coming out about it but just for a
face product so you know what I put on I
did not set my face with a powder I did
set like my under-eye area with the
powder I took awhile to set probably
about 20 minutes once it did I could
blend products totally fine on top it
doesn't feel like super sticky or
anything anymore you feel the makeup on
your face but it's not sticky I did set
my face with the elf makeup mist in set
setting spray Hague's a setting spray
every single day I don't think this one
really helps not that into this one I
just kind of want to use it up I don't
think it does a whole lot so my thoughts
right now is that it looks amazing I
want to do a flash test because I think
this totally looks like one that could
be beautiful for wedding makeup and like
special events prom whatever it just has
that look it's sitting really nice on
the skin gave me amazing coverage I
don't see it as like an everyday
foundation but it looks flawless and I
think this could look really good in
photos and just sort vents let's do a
quick flash test okay my picture was
blurry but it looks beautiful looks
really nice and flash doesn't have a
flash back at all we'll see how it holds
up throughout the day but right now I'm
really liking it for that like special
event kind of makeup right so it's now
1256 the foundation's been on for a
little over four hours I am about to eat
lunch I wanted to do this check in first
I've already peeled off the lashes it is
super super overcast today so it's
looking a little bit dark on here but I
wanted to film this check-in in natural
lighting so you can see okay so looking
at the makeup it looks freaking flawless
I'm gonna get really close so you can
see my forehead looks really good around
my nose my upper lip looks really good
usually I get like major caking up
around here my cheat like look at that a
tiny bit of texture around my nose but
nothing horrible at all again it's like
darkening everything up on this camera
right now because lighting is crap but
hopefully you can get an idea for hours
in is looking pretty damn good alright
so it's now 6:23 p.m. so the foundation
has been on for over 9
hours now I have some thoughts first of
all we can nor the shitshow of my the
rest of my makeup right now my eyes have
been burning so bad from that lash glue
I don't want to do the bottom so I
wouldn't mess up the foundation if you
can't tell I look super oily pretty much
everywhere like my chin around my nose
my forehead with that being said I feel
like if I blotted some of the oil off my
face right now
it would still look good like it hasn't
broken down it just looks oily I'm
definitely going to try this with powder
I actually went back online and I
ordered the shade creamy I'll put it
right here even though it's not listed
as the lightest shade it actually might
be lighter I ordered that in like two
days shipped it on Amazon so by the time
this video goes up
I'll have already gotten it and I can
swatch it so let you know down below in
the description box if that shade is
lighter or how it compares to the other
ones it looks like they have a few deep
shades on there the pale shades
obviously aren't light at all but I'm
not sure how deep the deep shades go
they might have good darker shades I do
really like this I think if I set my
face with a powder or blot throughout
the day it would be perfect
so things I like about it the coverage
on the two layers like I did is unreal I
would say it's pretty much completely
opaque definitely the most coverage
I have Anna stick foundation more than
the makeup forever stick foundation love
that you can get it completely
completely full coverage like it says
for the first five or six hours it looks
beautiful it looks like skin even though
you still have that insane amount of
coverage it just kind of like melts into
your skin if you have texture you might
really like this because I feel like it
really hid the texture on my skin my
skin look pretty damn flawless I'm going
to try setting it with this laura geller
powder right now just to see what
happens if it like kicks up over the oil
or what happens so setting it with a
powder at this point doesn't look
horrible that's just totally mattified
it I am not liking this under-eye
concealer at all you'll see in the other
video bye tried the amazing cosmetics
under-eye concealer around here which is
where I pulled that concealer down looks
pretty heavy but everywhere else on my
face looks really nice if you don't have
pale skin I would say this one is worth
a go I think this is one of the
more beautiful flawless stick
foundations I've ever tried I would say
this is up there with like the make up
forevers stick foundation the only major
difference is that this one doesn't
blend out the same this one is
definitely more stiff to blend out the
makeup coverage is kind of like glides
over your face I think you can wear this
one more sheer just like on that first
layer we got about a medium coverage if
you build it up to a second layer you
can definitely have more coverage in the
makeup forever stick foundation I think
this could work for more mature skin
because of the way it hides the texture
and just like melts into your skin I
think this one could work if you have
dry skin I think this one could work if
you have oily skin or oily skin than I
do you'll definitely want to set this
with the powder I think if you're going
to be wearing it for a long amount of
time but like I said for the first six
hours it looked really great I think
this could be really stunning for
special events like I said wedding
whatever so overall this one is a win
for me I'm really hoping that other
shade that I ordered is light enough
because I really like this I'm excited
about this one I hope you guys like this
video if you did make sure you give it a
thumbs up so I know I cannot wait to
wash my face right now
love you guys thanks for watching see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
