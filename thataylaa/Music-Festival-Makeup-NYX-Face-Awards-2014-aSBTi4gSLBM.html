festival makeup tutorial I decided to do
two different lip looks for you guys one
soft pink one and then the darker vampy
black lip we all know i'm all about the
crazy lip color this is my entry into
the next face award so if you like this
video go ahead and show your support by
giving it a thumbs up and help me get to
the top 30 as always all of the product
info will be listed in the downbar so
let's just get started we're going to
prime the eyes by using nixes HD high
definition eyeshadow base and i just
apply this all over my lid anywhere that
we are applying shadow this is going to
help your shadow stay all day without
creasing and give you some more
pigmentation for eyeshadows I'm using
the NYX but naked eyes palette this is a
really great everyday kind of palette
because you have some different neutral
colors and textures there's some matte
shadows in there and shimmer so I'm
using this dark taupe color on a fluffy
brush and we're going to blend this into
our crease this is going to serve as a
transition color and help all the other
shadows blend effortlessly for another
base I'm using NYX jumbo eye pencil and
milk and I'm just applying this to the
lid I'm going to pack the color on top
of this and this is just going to help
that color pop a little bit more so I'm
just blending it out with my finger then
I'm going to go in with this really
pretty light shimmery pink color to
apply so I'm just using a small flat
shader brush and I'm just going to press
this onto the lid up first to just pack
it on top of the NYX jumbo eye pencil
then I'm going to be using this bright
definer color from the petal pusher
palette and this is just a really pretty
bright purple and I'm blending this into
the crease with a smaller blending brush
we want to make sure that you focuses in
the crease and don't drag it too far
down over that lid color then we're
going to go back in with that light
shimmery pink color and just padding
this over the entire lid with my finger
to make sure that it's extra pigmented
and vibrant and then I'm going to be
taking the dark purple shade which is
gorgeous from the butt naked eyes
palette and I'm just defining the crease
a little bit more with this dark deep
purple color
taking a clean blending brush I'm just
going over everything so we don't have
any harsh lines then I'm going to be
taking elfs matte eyeshadow in the shade
brick and this is a really pretty warm
brown eyeshadow and on a small C brush
I'm just running this on my bottom lash
line this is really going to help warm
up the eyes especially if you have blue
or green eyes this will help make them
pop and then I'm going to be using a
pigment from NYX and this is the ultra
pearl mania I'm going to be doing the
exact same thing except applying this a
little lower than that matte brown shade
going in with another Nix pigment this
is a gorgeous shimmery white shade
reminds me exactly of max vanilla and
I'm just popping this in the inner
corner to brighten up the eyes you can
use these wet or dry so if you wanted a
little extra shimmer you could go ahead
and wet your brush now i'm using this
shimmery white shade from the butt naked
eyes palette and I'm putting this right
under the brow bone as a highlight and
then we gotta have our falsies I'm using
the NYX 123 bondage set these are
perfect for makeup looks without
eyeliner because it really opens up your
eyes and gives the effect of having
super separated lashes I'm using these
mascaras on my bottom lashes and how
crazy of a difference do baaltis make
I'm going to contour my face with NYX
blush and raisin this is perfect if you
have fair skin because it's not too dark
of a contour and it has a little bit of
a mock tone to it it's not going to look
too intense I'm choosing a contour brush
and getting in the halls of my
cheekbones and then for blush we're
bringing it back to the butt naked eyes
palette I'm using these middle two pink
shades to create the perfect tone of
blush that I wanted and I'm just putting
this on the apples of my cheeks for a
highlight I'm going to be using that
same color that we put on the inner
corner of our eyes I'm putting this on
all of the parts of my face that I want
highlighted when the light hits your
face this gives you such a pretty glow
and it's also really great for pictures
now on to the first lip option i use
kind of a concoction of lip products to
create this pink lilac lip first thing
i'm using is Nick's pretty in pink
retractable lip liner I'm lining and
filling in my lips with this stuff to
serve as the base color if you like a
matte pink lip you could totally just
stop right here
with this stuff or you can continue to
use any lip gloss you have just going to
serve as kind of a sticky material for
the pigment to stick on top of I'm going
back in with that purple lilac color and
I'm patting this on with a lip brush and
just blending it I think it gives you
such a pretty kind of reflective lilac
lip if you're like me and are all about
the dark lips you can use any black
lipstick that you have this is bye
pretty zombie cosmetics and splat cat or
Nick's also just came out with their
macaroon lipstick in the shade at
