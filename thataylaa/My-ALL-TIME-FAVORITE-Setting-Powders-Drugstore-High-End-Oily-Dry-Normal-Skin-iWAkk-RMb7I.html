made-up false eyelashes on top and
definitely still wearing my pajama shirt
German pants and Uggs
all right so today it is foundation
Friday and this is actually the last
foundation Friday before 15 days of
foundation starts next week on Thursday
6 p.m. Pacific time there's gonna be a
new video every single day for 15 days I
still have my normal videos going up
Monday and Wednesday of next week so
starting next week you guys are gonna
have a ton of videos for a few
weeks since I've been filming foundation
first impressions out the wazoo right
now I wanted to do a different video for
today's foundation Friday we're gonna be
talking all about my favorite powders
setting powders things that I set my
foundation with so some of these
products I've used for literally years
actually most of them I've used for a
long time there are a couple of newer
ones you guys will see a ton of them
that you've already heard about 50,000
times but I just wanted to make one
video talking all about what I like in
each powder how I would wear what kind
of foundations I would wear it with the
finish of them how the lightest shades
compare and also which ones I liked more
for my oily skin and then which ones
work now well for me with the dry skin
I'm in a rare position right now where
I've actually had all skin types so I
have a good idea of how these powders
perform on different skin types which
hopefully it's helpful for you guys so
if you're excited for this video and you
enjoy while you're watching don't forget
to give it a thumbs up if you're new
here you can join the BAE radio family
and subscribe since this is the only
video right now that I'm filming like in
real time I'm filming this on Thursday
and it's going up Friday when you guys
are seeing this I just want to say a
huge thank you for all of your support
so far we've raised over five thousand
fifty five hundred dollars I think right
now I checked this morning we're
shooting for twenty thousand dollars
actually added two mugs in two black
shirts down below that were the 15 days
of foundation limited edition designs
from past series so if you miss those
designs check the link down below
project be sure and I have been just
overwhelmed by all of you guys to
support you guys are incredible that's
linked down below and the announcement
video if you have no idea what I'm
talking about right now all right here
we go
favorite powders alright so powders for
me are something that my skin has had
always a really tricky time with I don't
know if it's because I have a lot of
texture but whether it's under eye
setting powder face powder it is
difficult for me to find a powder that
sits on top of my skin really
beautifully that doesn't take away the
coverage of the foundation underneath
you guys won't see any trims actually
there's one translucent powder in here
but for the most part I go for pressed
powder
that have some kind of pigment in it so
usually I actually go for a powder
foundation because that's something that
I don't find takes away coverage it
actually adds a little bit of coverage
on and if you have acne or if you have a
lot of things to cover up which I had
for years using a powder foundation to
set your foundation can be something
that works amazing even now that I don't
have nearly as much to cover up on my
skin I still like using these powders
because any kind of loose translucent
powder or most loose powders even if
they do have pigment to them take away
the coverage of my foundation make it
look splotchy just don't sit well on my
skin at all I've tried different ways to
apply them with sponges different
brushes I've tried everything and these
are like my Holy Grail powders that make
my skin look beautiful a lot of people
translucent powders look beautiful on
top of their foundation that's not the
case for me so just keep that in mind
with the powders I'm recommending a lot
of these are powder foundations which
doesn't really mean you can use
makeup however you want to if the powder
foundation works best to set your makeup
then use it just because it has the word
foundation attached to it doesn't mean
you can't use it as a setting powder it
just depends on how products sit on top
of your skin so with that in mind this
first powder is one that I've used for
years this is the Laura Geller balance
in Brighton and foundation SPF 15 in the
shade porcelain the lightest shade they
changed the packaging of this I actually
just ordered a new one it was on haul
with the other day for Half Price I
think goes around like 15 bucks on there
whole look is a flash sale site I'll
leave a link down below but it can be
awesome for finding makeup on there and
they changed the packaging so this is
the older packaging I've gone through so
many of these because this worked when I
had oil a skin and also this works now
that I have dry skin this is a powder
that gives you a beautiful satin finish
it's not the most glowy out of the
powders I want to talk about but does
have more of a radiant satin finish not
to the point where it's gonna make your
skin look too dewy it just gives a
really nice skin like satin finish to it
should we say satin finish again the
shade of this is beautiful if you have
fair skin this is actually a tiny bit
light for my skin so I love that for
lightening foundations that might be a
little bit too dark that's also
something that I use these powders for
is depending on how the shade of my
foundation is that day if I need to
lighten it if I need to darken it I can
always adjust it with a powder when I
had oily skin I don't feel like this is
a powder that particularly
controlled my oil or anything and mostly
just helped set my foundation if I ever
have a foundation that just turns out
too cakey who looks like too much this
is one of the powders I'll use to kind
of just smooth everything blend
everything together over the years I've
also found that the brush I used to
apply my powder with makes a huge
difference if you have never really
found a powder that you feel like is
making your skin look good the brush
might be the issue I say the majority of
people tend to apply powder with a brush
like this that's very soft very flimsy
and it looks great on a lot of people
but with my skin and my weird powder
issues I have to use something like this
that is much more densely packed that
almost could be like a liquid foundation
brush that's how dense it is this is the
for less cb4 brush I love this brush for
powder whenever you guys see me applying
powder in a video it's using this brush
especially in the last probably a year
or so and the way I apply powder is just
literally first kind of packing it on
and pressing it into my skin then I'll
go in and do some light blending if you
just go in straight away and blend
especially with the dense brush like
this it's just gonna wipe away the
foundation underneath so make sure
you're kind of packing it on first even
if you just tap it in a couple times and
then go in and pack you don't need to be
packing on like a ton of product but I
just find that that's what makes my
powder and foundation look the most
flawless another option this one is a
tiny bit more flimsy but I don't find
that it's quite as bad as something like
this on my skin this is the morphe one I
don't even know if they make this brush
anymore but this brush is super nice and
soft and it has the right amount
flimsiness where it's not as dense as a
brush like this but for me and what I
like 99% of the time I'll go in with
this brush I just want to point that out
because if you have a powder that you
don't like try trying it with a firmer
brush and using different techniques to
apply it because it might just be the
way that you're applying it not
necessarily the product all right so
moving on to the next one and these are
in no order I'm just mentioning all of
my favorites this is the Maybelline fit
me loose powder in the shade 0-5 fair so
this is one of the few loose powders I
only have one other loose powder I'm
going to talk about here that works for
my skin it doesn't take away the
coverage underneath this powder is one
of my favorites when I had oil II skin I
feel like this really locked my makeup
in all day I could use this on top of
something like laura geller cover lock
or the milk
make up Blair liquid which on their own
for oily skin don't have the best
lasting power but if you combine it with
something like this my skin literally
looked flawless all day long that
routine was actually what I did in the
makeup for photography video so link
that down below but that went in depth
about how I used this powder with those
foundations this is a drugstore powder
the shade is actually light enough it's
really hard to find fair powders at the
drugstore adds a little bit of coverage
just gives you the most beautiful kind
of soft focus matte finish think about
the products that you're putting
underneath your powders because when I
think about combining products that is
where I start so if I'm going to be
using something like this which is a
matte loose powder underneath I
typically would want to wear a
foundation that is a little bit more
dewy so I still have a skin like look
shining through the only other loose
powder that I love is the cover effects
illuminating setting powder this is a
gorgeous powder if you like a glow this
one get if you want matte this one get
if you like glowy but you still want to
set your makeup this was one of the few
with oily skin that I could have that
glowy look that wouldn't break down on
me throughout the day this has such a
beautiful fair pinkish tint to it so if
you have a yellow undertone this
probably isn't the powder for you
but if you have more of a neutral pink
undertone any a fair skinned this shade
light is beautiful I've used this in so
many videos if you ever want to see any
of these powders used in a video just
search the Tayla
and then the name of the powder and any
video that I have using it will pop up
you need a light hand with this one use
a dense brush like this one with this I
like using that on this area of my face
but if I use it on my forehead it can be
a little bit too much like too
glowy almost so I'll use a brush like
this on my forehead to get a little bit
more of a diffused look this powder is
one that I'll always continue to
repurchase it works great on my dry skin
it works great on my oily skin if you
like that glowy finish if you don't
don't get this powder
this next powder is one I would
recommend if you want a very airbrushed
look this truly is a blurring kind of
powder which sounds gimmicky but it
actually works this is a cosmetics bye
bye pores pressed powder it says this
airbrush silk pressed powder and it
feels like friggin silk it feels so soft
in the pan I hit pan on this I haven't
used this since I've had dry skin but
there's something so flattering about
this powder that I do
find really does smooth and almost blur
out my skin when I had oil II skin this
is something that I would use on my
forehead around my pores it truly helps
the only thing with this is that I think
it might have broke me out but that was
one of the reasons that I kind of slowed
down on using this this is the only
translucent powder that I have found to
this day that doesn't take away the
coverage underneath so if you also have
issues with that but you don't want a
powder that's gonna add cover just gonna
change the color of your foundation then
you might want to go with this powder
all right next up if you've seen any of
my videos you definitely would guess
this powder but this is the ICCA's medic
celebration foundation illumination this
is a true powder foundation this
definitely has coverage to it I don't
find it's a complete full coverage
powder like they say but you can really
build this up to get great coverage on
its own if you are using it as a powder
foundation I like to use it more still
to the state to set my foundation this
is beautiful and dry skin it was great
on oily skin the only thing is this
doesn't last as well throughout the day
as something like the cover effects
illuminating setting powder I find that
it can look a little bit heavy
throughout the day if you use to have
you have a hand with this which they
came out with more shades in this one
the shade fair is a little bit too dark
for me and it is quite yellow but
there's something so transformative
about using this powder on top of a
foundation this is the powder that can
save the day if you have a foundation on
that's just looking like pure sees
that's like patchy to dry just doesn't
look good this powder can totally change
your face I just use this yesterday on
you guys will see in 15 days of
foundation but there is one foundation
that just looked so patchy so dry - Matt
and I tried this on top of it yesterday
and it literally makes your skin look
like a different foundation this truly
can save just about any bad foundation
day which is mostly what I reach for it
now if I'm just having a foundation
where I'm like what is going on on my
face right now but this is a true
illuminating powder so if you don't like
glowy powders don't get this one alright
so next up is a powder that I don't
think I've heard anyone talk about
online and I actually just discovered
this within the last couple months I
want to say and I've been reaching for
it a lot lately this is the Sephora
micro smooth powder has pretty light
coverage
is more of like a finishing powder but
it has the most beautiful finish where
it does almost smooth out and it has a
satin finish so it gives you a little
bit of a glow almost like the laura
geller balance of right in the first one
not as glowy as the a cosmetics one but
it does give you more of just like a
radiant kind of glow I love how
lightweight this feels on my skin I feel
like this is a totally underrated powder
this is a beautiful finishing powder it
actually reminds me a lot of the wet and
wild photo focus press powder which I
don't love for my skin quite as much as
the other products I'm talking about but
I do feel like this might be one that it
works for a lot of people it's like it's
almost there for me I just don't love it
as much as the Sephora one another
powder that I also feel like is totally
underrated that I haven't heard I don't
think I've ever heard anything on
YouTube about this is the pearly shade
front first the cargo HD blu-ray powder
this is one of the softest matte powders
when I think of like a filter powder
that gives you that smoothing kind of
look I think of this powder I don't know
what's going on with cargo I feel like I
never hear about them anymore but it
wasn't Kohl's the other day and they had
a lot of cargo stuff so I don't know
this one I think I really started
picking up and using maybe a month or so
before starting accutane so like six
months ago now so don't feel like I have
a good grip on how this performs on oily
skin but as my skin started to getting
jars this was when the matte powders
that didn't make me look totally
horrible and cakey and I should note
that on my dry skin right now I
typically only apply powders in this
area some of these powders I can totally
use on my forehead with dry skin but I
just prefer the look of having a glow
ear forehead and I find that throughout
the day on dry skin my foundation
doesn't break down without powder it's
actually quite magical I'm hoping that
dr. accutane my skin stays more normal
dry because it really is so much easier
to deal with than having oily skin but
anyways my point being I'm not sure how
oil controlling this powder is it works
well in my dry skin didn't give it a
full run with oily skin a matte powder
that I discovered well on accutane that
works beautifully on dry skin I think
one of you guys recommended this in the
comments on a video this is the NYX
hydro touch powder foundation why is no
one talking about this this is in the
shade porcelain I want to get a
different shade because this shade is
very yellow but this powder oh my
one of the most soft pigmented powders
look at that that really does not dry
out your skin
I think the Hydra touch description is
spot-on it just kind of melts into my
skin it gives me a matte finish without
looking super flat and dry if you have
dry skin but you like a matte finish and
you have struggled finding powders then
try this out I think a lot of people
would love this powder it's a great
drugstore option so next up is one that
I don't like on my dry skin but that I
used to really like on my oily skin this
is the Laura Geller double take baked
powder foundation in the shade porcelain
and I've also hit pan on this guy this
one was tricky with my oily skin because
I felt like it wasn't a powder that
looked phenomenal by the end of the day
but I loved it for the first probably
five hours of wearing it I would say
this one gives you a little more
coverage than the balance and brighten
and it has a matte finish it did sit
really beautifully on my skin for the
first half of the day and I like the
coverage that it gave me which is why I
kept reaching for this but it is one of
those that on my skin by the end of the
night it would look a little bit heavy
so just keep that in mind it could be
totally different on your skin this is
one that I would only recommend if you
have normal to oily skin but probably
more on the normal side the last powder
we're gonna talk about is the maybelline
superstay better skin powder in the
lightest shade 10 porcelain another one
those kind of soft focus matte powders I
wouldn't say it's quite as blurring and
soft looking as a cargo blue-ray powder
but for a drugstore option if you want a
matte powder that just sits on the skin
really well try this guy it's a
beautiful powder I hate the packaging of
this I just feel like it's so bulky for
this one little pan it also says it has
salicylic acid in it so if you have acne
prone skin that could help depending on
how your skin reacts Acela silk acid but
just keep that in mind this one with my
dry skin looks fine on my cheek area I
haven't tried this on my forehead yet so
I can't say how it looks as like an
all-over face powder on dry skin but I
did really like this powder out with
oily skin I didn't find it to be the
most oil controlling I'm going to talk
about one product I think is the most
oil controlling powder but this powder I
think if you're looking for a drugstore
matte powder that's not gonna totally
emphasize texture and everything better
skin is a super pretty powder so I have
three more products that I want to
mention that are kind of like honourable
mentions they're not powders that I
would use on their own at all but I use
them in two
waise so the first one is the RCM a no
color powder I've had so many of you
guys asked me what my thoughts are on
this because I never really talked about
it I actually used this for the first
time when I was staying at Mallory's
house Mallory 1712 and I've always heard
people raving about the RCM a no color
powder I just never purchased it cuz I
was like it's another translucent powder
I'm probably not gonna like it but I
tried to add Mallory's house and this is
when I had oily skin and this is one of
the few powders that I truly feel like
was oil controlling and I would not put
this all over my face because if I did
it would do that thing where it takes
away the coverage underneath I only put
this on my t-zone and I felt like it
really controlled my oil on my t-zone if
I did use this though I would put on my
liquid foundation put a little bit this
down as like an oil controlling product
and then since it did take away a little
bit of the coverage I would then go in
with like a light dusting of one of
these powders over top just to add that
coverage back so if you have issues with
powders like I do just keep that in mind
but if you don't a lot of people love
this powder
I think the all-over best oil
controlling powder I've ever found is
the Rimmel stay matte powder from the
drugstore that powder does amazing
things for controlling oil the only
thing is Rimmel products break me out
horribly so that was one of the powders
that definitely made my skin break out
I'm talking bad deep like cystic
breakouts with that product but once I
figured out that that was really not
helping my skin I cut that out of my
routine totally and stopped using it but
everyone's skin is different so a lot of
products that break me out might be
totally fine on other people so if you
do have super oily skin and you want to
part this oil controlling Rimmel stay
matte from the drugstore I would
recommend trying just watch your skin to
see how it reacts to it next two
products are totally opposite of the RCM
a these are products that if you have
dry skin or if you have oily skin but
you just want a sheen to your skin these
are products that I either mix in or
kind of top off my foundation with a
giant fluffy brush like this one to give
your skin that glow from within look so
the first one is a highlighter that I've
talked about in my last waves and
rejects video this is the j-cap pearl
Luminizer beautiful face highlight but
if you tap in a tiny bit of this and
even mix it with something like another
loose powder like Maybelline fit me
that radiant glow kind of looked just be
careful what brush you're applying this
with I would not go in with this powder
alone as a face powder and something
like this brush that would be a total
disaster and I think the reason why this
can work as a face powder is because of
the way that it blends out as you blend
it out it just melts into your skin and
looks so beautiful so this not alone
mixed in and then the EXO Beauty Aurora
powder which I also mentioned in race
and rejects as a highlight to give you
that glow from within kind of look this
can be used just really lightly just
dusted over super lightly to give you
that radiant overall look so those are
just a couple products that I use to
give that glow but that aren't
necessarily setting powders or powder
foundations or even intended for that
purpose whoo okay I feel like that was a
lot of info who's still with me right
now
comment down below so I hope that was
helpful for you guys and kind of
explains why I use powder foundations
and how I use different products these
are just my top powders I reach for them
over and over again keep in mind like
always everyone's skin is different so
products work differently especially
face products on different people
depending on your skin type your texture
what you're dealing with as far as your
skin concerns products are gonna work
totally different and I am living proof
of that now a lot of products that used
to work with me with oily skin just look
terrible on my skin now and vice versa
so just keep that in mind when you're
taking recommendations from anyone on
the interweb I'm just here to share what
works for me and hopefully it can also
work for you if you did enjoy this video
and found it helpful don't forget to
give it a thumbs up I really appreciate
it and it helps me out I tried filming
swatches of these powders and you really
couldn't see anything so that's why
there aren't swatches in this video
leave every powder link down below in
the description box and the makeup on
the rest of my face but just to quickly
go over that for bronzer I use the Kevyn
Aucoin celestial bronzing veil I used it
more as a contour today just use the
lightest shade here's one of my favorite
products blush I use ciate summer love
also one of my favorite blushes ever
highlight I use the new anastacio amrezy
highlight and I just used a little bit
of it but you can make this friggin
blinding for lips I use the NARS lip
pigment in the shade don't stop super
bright red I really liked the formula of
this and how it didn't feel too drying
but
I really don't like the applicator is
like a super stiff applicator but then
on top of it I put a little bit of the
ultra glossy lip by color pop in the
shade Netta you guys will see me raving
in one of the days of 15 days foundation
about this when I first tried it but
I've used it about I want to say three
times since that video that you guys
will be seeing and I am so in love with
this this is the Milani most loved
mattes palette this is their new
eyeshadow palette and I also have this
one bold obsessions which is their other
one that has just some shimmer shades in
there holy-shit sees you guys these are
one of the best drugstore releases of
old time I am so impressed by these it's
all of my eye shadows on my eyes right
now and my lashes are pur cosmetics diva
lashes so again this is the last
foundation Friday before the series
starts so the next foundation Friday
will be after 1580 foundation so I love
you guys thanks for watching see you on
