actually I have one vlog but I put on
private cuz it's boring as or I
think so
I just waited in line at jack-in-the-box
for about 25 minutes like what the hell
all I ordered was curly fries a huge ass
coke and coffee I'm pretty sure I could
have gone to the damn farm got a potato
cut it curled it and then made my own
damn curly fries in the time that it
took me to get them how do people do
like 17-minute vlogs my arms already
sore maybe that's a sign I should work
out I'm eating jack-in-the-box
and then like usually if someone takes
like 500 hours and a drive-thru those
like say something you know like oh yeah
it's coming right up whatever anything
this guy didn't say anything so I was
like sitting there staring at him cuz I
didn't know if he knew like he still
needed to get those damn curly fries so
we're like staring at each other and he
wasn't saying anything and then the car
behind me started honking and I was like
do you want me to personally go in there
and fry up some damn fries because I
will by the way got a haircut today cut
eight inches off it's this short now no
just kidding it's all back here by him I
think exciting I told her to do like
layers in the frontal area and then just
like one length on the bottom second so
know when this vlog will be up but I did
these like braided nails after watching
vadas rads tutorial I think they're
pretty dang cool I've gotten like a lot
of compliments from random people on
them I got a shot yesterday and the lady
oh look battle wound and when she was
like putting this shot in me she's like
oh I like your nails as they're so cute
I was like I think you need to focus on
that needle in my arm
so here's the huge ass coke I got um I
got diet coke with a little bit of root
beer cuz I'm a diva like that I don't
know my friend told me that and they do
this out like McDonald's and stuff too
if you get a lot like huge ass on like
this it's cheaper than a small size
which is really weird to me I feel like
a monster like carrying this thing
around
but I feel bad cuz I never can drink the
whole thing I don't know what the point
of that is I feel like they do it like a
reverse psychology thing where like
people think they're paying less very
small but really they're getting ripped
off so they sell more of the smaller
than the extract you largest oh no
that's just my theory I only have one
fryer left that are big good curly one
so disappointing when you only get like
one actual curly fry and your curly fry
batch looks kind of like a I'm sitting
in this old people parking lot and
there's all these like nurses walking
out cuz their shift just ended it's
ladies watching me holler talk about two
random nurse lady
how do people vlog and like get things
accomplished at the same time I'm
struggling lady is still staring at me
let's have a stair contest I don't know
if you guys can see it on there I'm like
halfway not even halfway done and I
already feel like I'm gonna pee my pants
coke do that to anyone else the second I
have soda I feel like I'm like a
pregnant woman about to pee everywhere I
don't even know if I'm gonna upload this
so basically I'm just sitting in my car
talking to myself right now
he's so dang dark maybe I should have
brought my actual camera it was an
impromptu vlog okay moving on to my
third third course of my meal my really
classy jack-in-the-box coffee I just got
my coffee I like my coffee black I don't
like to sugarcoat you know what I
mean these things are so deceiving
because they don't feel hot from the
outside and then you like burn the
out of your mouth
interesting it's kind of like water
should I put my random Starbucks thing
around it so it makes me look like a
classy bitch oh that's a good trick
that's so deceiving Oh
accepting and still see Jack and bucks
anywho
oh yeah the reason why I'm sitting in
this old people parking lot is because
my grandma lives here we visit her a lot
because we live really close so I have a
bunch of to drop off for her you
guys can get a shot of my messy car
oh it's actually clean I forgot I got it
cleaned yeah there's all the stuff I
have to bring to her she's so cute well
if I end up uploading this and you guys
like more on you knowing then call us
old people parking lot vlogs then let me
know and it shall continue but until
then I'll see you at a later time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
