all right so today I'd be showing you
guys my favorite drugstore news
lipsticks I have 15 of them here I want
to include a range of different news
from light to deeper news just because
this is one of the things that looks
totally different on every single skin
tone something that is actually in news
news like this on me would look totally
white and ghostly on someone with a
deeper skin tone and something that
looks like a lighter nude on a deeper
skin tone could look like a brown dark
nude on me so I wanted to include kind
of a range of different nude shades so
that you can choose which one is best
for you depending on your skin tone I'm
going to start with the lightest and
then work my way up products I'm going
to be showing our ones that I recommend
obviously the shade but also the formula
sometimes on my favorite lipstick
formulas I'm a drugstore just in general
I'm going to be trying on all of these
on camera so you can see how they look
on my skintone haven't done a lip try on
video and forever let's do this I was
just out in the Sun it has like
sunglasses on so we can ignore the
foundation Sun laughs lines
anyone knows how to avoid those limited
envelope so starting with probably the
lightest nude lipstick that I found from
the drugstore and almost just in general
this is kind of along the lines of math
math math myth is actually a little bit
darker than this one on me
this is Maybelline 9/10 bear all this is
like borderline ghostly nudes but I'm
feeling this I think this kind of nude I
don't know I think it's going to make it
come back but this is the shade that I
have on right now Maybelline lipsticks
are one of my favorite formulas however
the smell is a little bit crayon me and
chemically I only complete with this one
is that since it is so light it's a
little bit patchy in certain parts they
might want to wear a lip liner
underneath this but I mean I'm wearing
it right now totally fine without a lip
liner
so next step only putting on BH
Cosmetics wink
BH you can only buy online but it is
drugstore prices this is actually on the
cheaper end BH Cosmetics always does
sales so never buy anything full price
in there because they pretty much always
rotate out their sales by the way every
single product I'm talking about and be
links down below in the description box
like always everything is down there so
here's goings on this one looks a little
bit more peachy to me I usually kind of
stay away from the peachy nude just
because it looks a little bit off on my
skin tones but this
I think is one that I can wear and I
wear this one I usually like to put more
of a pinky gloss over top so next up is
the NYX high voltage lipstick in Mirage
I love the formulas views they're super
pigmented this one still has more peach
undertones but does look a tiny bit more
pink and alive to me than the BH one I
love this lipstick for layering if I
have a deeper nude on and I want to just
either lighten it a little bit or just
make the center of my lips look a little
bit more plump in big I'll just put a
tiny bit of this on the center of my
lips and just kind of dab it on and this
is a really good lip stay for layering
doesn't look crusty or weird or anything
okay it literally has what is going on
and get eyelash glue navel
so next step is Maybelline 7:55 new
thrill I believe this is when they're
newer matte lipsticks from their thing
is called the bolt collection or
something if you want a matte lipstick
that doesn't feel drying and is more on
the topi kind of nude side this one
doesn't have any kind of peach
undertones this is more of a taupe color
I love this one
next up is Maybelline 920 news left okay
mention a lot of Maybelline but I feel
like I think Maybelline has one of the
best pale nude lipstick ranges at the
drugstore where of other brands and
Maybelline coming up but Maybelline does
make some the lightest shades nude less
is beautiful this is like one of those
shades that I think would be really
pretty for wedding makeup this is one of
my favorites for sure this one can go
with literally any look it's not too
nude it's not too pink not too peach
this is kind of perfect standard news
this one has a little bit of a sheen to
it isn't totally matte feels really
comfortable on the lips 920 definitely
one of my favorites next up is the NYX
lip lingerie and satin ribbon I've mixed
feelings on the formula bees these are
liquid lipstick they're not super
long-lasting at all they do come off
when you eat and everything so I
typically don't reach for these that
often because I just don't like when my
liquid lipsticks come off but the shade
of this is really pretty and it's good
for layering this one can look super
nude on some people obviously isn't that
kind of nude on me it's just kind of
like a neutral pinky nude next up is
Maybelline 860 smooth taupe actually
thinks this is one of the lighter ones I
don't know why I'm mentioning this right
now and probably should bump this one up
a little bit
this one to me is pale but where
durable this is like a very wintry new
to me like I just think with a sweater
and a scarf I just like the shade of
nude it is definitely one of my oldest
and most used nude lipsticks next up is
another NYX lip lingerie this one is in
the shade of babydoll this one applies a
little bit patchy and shrieky for me you
have to kind of wait for it to set and
then kind of fill in the gap out of the
ones I'm talking about if you have dry
lips I would probably say stay away from
this formula I wouldn't say I'm super
and somewhat ease I want to say have
super dry lips but it does kind of
settle into the cracks on my lips a
little bit but shade wise nice peachy
pink here you go next up is Rimmel
moisture renewal lipstick in 710 a
first-class nude love this shade love
the formula B's the only thing I don't
like about this is the smell it smells
so bad it literally smells like bathroom
spray I think they were going for floral
but it just smells like a busy but I
love the shade of this I think this
could be wearable for a bunch of
different skin tones Rimmel lipsticks
are pretty bomb this is the elf
moisturizing lipstick in in the nudist
formula these feels really nice and
moisturizing but it is a little bit
stiffer than the other ones I mentioned
which I kind of like because they feel
like it's not going to budge as easily
and a fun fact in the bottom of elf
lipsticks you can actually take this off
and it's a little gloss thing I've never
actually used this clearly but it is
there this one and the one I'm going to
mention next are the ones that if I want
a little something-something but I don't
want to look like I have a deep nude on
or brown lipstick or anything I usually
go for these ones it's very wearable but
it still looks like you have a lipstick
on your lips so this is the Milani
lipstick in 61 and matte naked if you've
been watching my videos for a couple
years now
you know I've raised about this lipstick
this is one of my all-time favorite
lipstick shades this one of those colors
that almost every time I wear it someone
asked me what's on my lips it's just a
really unique kind of dusty nude rose
color it just looks really flattering
with any look you do any clothes you
wear like my go to love this one and
love the formulas and actually lasts
really well throughout the day this is
the Jordana modern matte lipstick in
matte innocent I feel like these
lipsticks are never talked about and so
underrated
these are awesome I'm pretty sure
they're under like
six bucks they feel like they're not
going to budge they have that feel to
them where it's not drying at all but
they're matte and they aren't going to
move around on your lips this line has
tons of different shades and they're
super affordable so if I were you have
to just take out a few and kind of try
them on and see what's your favorite on
your skin tone this is the NYX soft
matte lip cream in the shade Stockholm
and this one almost looks like a muted
red rose nude on me I wanted to include
this one because I know a lot of people
do love the formula B's these transfer
super easily for me and I do feel like
they're going to end up all over my face
if I go to eat a meal so for me I don't
typically reach for this formula a whole
lot but the shade is really pretty and I
know a lot of people do love this
formula next up is maybelline 215 total
toffee we have a ton of Maybelline
in here the formula this one feels
almost exactly like the 920 nude lush
just feels very comfortable on the lips
I think this is a perfect wintery nude
if you want something a little bit
darker but it's not brown or red or
anything last we have the Rimmel Kate
Moss lipstick in the shade 14 Kate Moss
is like throwing it back for me this
lipstick was one of the ones I wore most
often throughout college and pretty sure
that's when her question launch was when
I was in college love the formula of
these lipsticks pretty much any of them
try them out these ones also lasts
pretty well throughout the day is more
of a cream formula they're not super
matte but they don't machine to them how
much can you say about a nude lipstick
I'm finding out you can't see a whole
lot so those are all my top 15 picks for
drugstore new lips if you guys liked
this video and it was helpful for you
make sure you give it a thumbs up so I
know just to quickly answer a couple
questions I've been getting asked a lot
on snapchat and Twitter lately yes I
bought the silly sponge yes I bought the
new L'Oreal total cover foundation both
of those are coming as soon as I have
them I will be doing videos on both of
those products foundation Friday is
returning this week 6 p.m. Pacific time
love you guys thanks for watching see my
