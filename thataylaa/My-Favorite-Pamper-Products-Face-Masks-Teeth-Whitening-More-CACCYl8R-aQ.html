background today to set the mood hello
beauty guru
all right so today we're going to be
talking about my favorite pamper
products these are basically the
products that I use at night why does it
feel like it's 95 degrees in here right
now I mean to talk about my favorite
face mask for a while so I'm including
those in this video
it's kind of like my favorite unwind
products for the end of the night and
also how I keep my teeth white so it's
kind of my nighttime products let me
help you guys like routine videos better
when you see me actually doing it or if
you like this style video I feel like I
can talk more in depth about the actual
products when I do it this way but let
me know what you prefer down below
before we jump into the video my hair is
obviously dark
this is demi-permanent we're actually
doing silver hombre today since I'm
going to be out of town for the holidays
and use the film today so that is why I
have black hair right now let's refrain
from all hair comments that'd be awesome
let's jump into the product I feel like
I need another cup of coffee right now
so every time I wear these eye masks on
snapchat I get questions about what they
are I don't think I've ever actually
mentioned these in video possibly in
Orinda rejects video but I love these
things these are the crystal cauldron
gold powder eye masks they're super
cheap you can get them off of Amazon I
get them in like a pack of ten and
pretty sure they're under ten bucks the
type of skin is a ski your skin
I think it's skin Iceland guys they're
under eye mask and for the price I just
really didn't see use that much of a
difference I love picking these in the
refrigerator and just putting them on
first thing in the morning they're super
refreshing
even without city Amanda fridge they're
super cooling I don't think they're
going to help like your wrinkles or
anything like that under the eyes really
but they do help do puffs whenever I'm
just freaking exhausted and feel like I
need something extra in the morning I
just pop these on and they're all so
gold that makes it extra exciting
everything I talked about like always
linked down below the description box
okay I have a ton of face masks here to
mention it when I simmer with other
products so we don't just talk about
face masks for 10 minutes but and we
start out with probably my favorite face
mask
lately in the last like few months which
is the L'Oreal pure clay mask remember I
talked about the black L'Oreal message
is what I'm talking about has literally
gone through two of these and this one
is almost empty there's something about
this that makes my skin feel so smooth
and detoxified and I personally really
like the smell it does have a really
strong sense a little bit perfumey but
it doesn't really bother me
isn't I think is more for normal to oily
skin if you have dry skin probably
wouldn't recommend this and it has this
really nice consistency to it where it
almost feels like a gel clay mask if
that makes sense I've never felt a
consistency like this in a face mask
before it goes on super smooth I just
really love this so a teeth whitening
this is how to keep my teeth white these
three products are literally all I use t
my teeth white they work wonders the
whitening gel and talking about I've
been using for a long time now probably
nine months this is white with style I
talked about this before cut two bags
here because one is the trays that I've
been using for a long time this is a new
package so basically these are like at
home teeth whitening kids these for me
actually work obviously I wouldn't be
talking about them with begin this is
anyone I have so in a little kit you get
to use gel so you basically just plop
them in boiling water until they're soft
and squishy and you can mold them to
your teeth then just plop them in cold
water cut around the gum line because
you obviously want the product on your
teeth not on your gums and then all you
do is just work the little gel into the
trays you need the tiniest amount of gel
on line says the jealous with the last
few ten uses actually get a little bit
more out of it I don't know if I'm not
using enough but I still see results
with it it could be because i whiten my
top more than my bottom teeth they just
put the trays in get to turn on this one
little LED light thing and this just
totally closes around your mouth and i
get lipstick all over my face if i try
to put this in right now but you can
just chill with this in your mouth i
usually work or watch youtube or
whatever while i happens in at night
once you get your teeth to the level of
white that you're going for you have to
use it way less often i literally only
use it about once a month now to make
sure that my choose to live white but
the other two products am i talking
about help maintain the whiteness so if
you're only using this for once or twice
a month this will last you anywhere from
about five to ten months depending on
how often you use it as you medicine
these are cruelty free vegan and gluten
free they don't have proc side in them
so process is the ingredient and
whitening products that if you have
sensitive to use that's what can really
make your teeth sensitive so i've never
felt that like cold feeling with this
whitening product this is like the big
kahuna this is what i'm using when I
feel like my teeth are starting to get
yellow again this video is in
collaboration with white with style it
wasn't something that I believed in I
wouldn't talk about it but the coupon
codes the table will give you a 90
percent off retail so you can get this
for 28 bucks so these two other products
are like my
maintenance mode peace products so I
have two Colgate optic white Express
white toothpaste the Express white
version is my favorite I really don't
like the taste of it I feel like it
doesn't taste as minty as a crest 3d
white toothpaste but if you feel like
this toothpaste works better than 3d
white for me I actually saw a difference
in the first few days of using this I
don't think it was psychological I think
I actually saw a difference and then
this product I swear by this is the
crest 3d white left glamorous white
alcohol-free not toothpaste mouthwash I
really love the Colgate optic white
mouthwash as well I stopped using this
mouthwash a couple years ago because I
thought it made my lip ring infected and
has just been because it was newer back
then so they decided to try us out again
a few months ago and now it's totally
fine with my lip ring doesn't make it
burn or anything like that and I really
feel like this makes a difference I use
this once a day use it at night after I
brush my teeth in this in combination
with the Colgate is totally fine it
doesn't make my too sensitive or
anything like that so on a full-blown
pamper night I will put on a face mask
at the same time as a hair mask and my
favorite hair mask 8ly has in the Loreal
total were purified the damage racing
balm this thing rocks
I've tried tons of high-end products if
you like into some a little profit try
to so many high-end hair products that
fix my frickin hair and this one I feel
like makes the biggest difference I
don't know you can get this for like
under 10 bucks at the drugstore so you
usually use this in the shower but you
can also use it on dry hair and just put
like a cap around your head and that's
the face mask on very relaxing I mean I
leave this on for like an hour I need to
another one my favorite maps and this
one is super affordable is the Giovanni
detox system purifying facial mask this
is another one that's like charcoal I
really like a charcoal II kind of once
smells refreshing that doesn't have a
super strong scent to me if it says it
has charcoal volcanic ash and super
antioxidants like acai and goji berries
this one really helps to not dry out my
skin but it really does like detoxify I
feel like I got this off of iHerb I have
seen Giovanni products at t.j.maxx
lately so I'm not sure if you'll will be
able to find that there but this is
super affordable and I heard a not so
affordable face mask is the fresh
Imbrium clay purifying mask this is
another top flying mask this one I
really didn't want to like because it's
so expensive but it probably will be
repurchasing this because I do think it
helps my skin I hate to smell this it
almost smells like a Mario Badescu
smells like very raw ingredients in here
hi I'm looks like baby food
it says you only have to leave this on
for 3 to 5 minutes I actually lived on
for an hour I leave almost all my face
mess on for like half an hour to an hour
of the 3 face masks I mentioned so far I
think you could probably go with one of
the three if you're into high-end max
and you want like top quality
ingredients this one is really nice this
is the body shop peppermint intensive
flip rescue and I got this because my
feels are super dry and crafts right now
might be TMI but everyone has feels
right this i listening on when I get out
of shower I'll just like coat this all
over my feet and that's put on socks and
this actually works it makes your feet
feel softer it's really pretty like
cotton candy pink color and it smells
amazing it smells like peppermint but
also a little bit more medicinal just
super safe product really helps with my
cracks and dryness I only have two more
face masks and I'm going to stop
bombarding it with face masks but this
is the Aztec secret Indian healing clay
mask you can get this join us tub off of
Amazon it's a and I really want to open
it cuz powders can go all over but it's
a straight-up powder you can make this
with water but I like to mix it with
apple cider vinegar which supposed to be
really good for acne this is intense you
guys this is like for me a once every
week or once every two weeks kind of
mask this is more of a skin treatment to
me than a like relaxing nightly kind of
face mask first couple times you use it
your face might get really really red
afterwards and that's normal and on the
back it says a sometimes you feel your
face pull and I totally feel that some
type of search base mask like your skin
underneath feels like it's kind of cool
things there is no talking happening
when you have this face mask on this is
one where you need to just like chill in
your room and not talk to the world for
a little bit this one out of all these
I've been using for the least amount of
time but I've quickly been falling in
love with this this is the origin out of
trouble ten minute mask to rescue
problem skin we all know I got a lot of
cystic acne going on my skin has been
bad again I hope you guys can see on
camera but I have major cystic breakouts
on my channel again when I was looking
at this on Ulta the ingredient sold me
this has zinc oxide sulfur
camphor salicylic acid and my skin
reacts really well it's also fasted it's
just done really good ingredient
smells like Mentholatum if you've ever
use methylation like when you're sick it
smells exactly like Mentholatum I
personally really love the smell yet
like a very minty cooling kind of
sensation and I do only leave this on
for about 15 minutes a just a couple
days ago when I had open acne on my face
and I just actually used up like a spot
treatment you can use it like that as
well and I feel like it really helps to
dry it down so I wanted to mention my
favorite essential oils and diffuser
because I get a lot of questions about
this on snapchat whenever I show it
essential oils I have mixed feelings
about reason why I tried this originally
or for my migraines and I don't think it
does anything for my migraines
whatsoever when I just put it in the
diffusers I do have this tension roll-on
essential oil so link it down below that
got it off of Amazon now I feel like
kind of gives me the same effect as
Biofreeze it doesn't make the pain go
away but it relieves it a tiny bit but
how I use essential oils now is just for
scent like in the room before I'm going
to bed certain scents are really calming
and different oils do different things
so there's like energizing oils as
cleaning oils there's relaxation oil but
I just use it to basically help relax at
night so my favorite all-time scent is
peppermint and it's by the Eden's garden
brand I think Eden's garden makes my
favorite central oils I've totally gone
through the peppermint one so I need to
reorder it but this is heavy I also
really like this one and then I have
been now tea tree oil which is like a
giant thing a tea tree this smells
really good minty fresh tea tree scent
this is obviously a pure tea tree oil my
diffuser is back there plugged in but
I'm going to search a clip right now but
so you can see this is the now brand
diffuser I got it off of Amazon I've had
it for probably over a year now a year
and a half maybe I don't like to look
like the cheap plasticky diffusers this
one feels like it's really good quality
you just take the top off it has a
bamboo outside I just love diffusing
some oils at night it really helps to
relax and especially we have the face
mask on the flip cream and the hair mask
and you got your oils go in just a good
time so this is probably the most random
thing I'm mentioning but this is like a
total mental thing for me but it totally
helps I got these glass bottles off of
Amazon and I got Christy to get them
Robbie to Christie has also changed her
water drinking game so I feel like 100%
psychological but it actually helps I
get six of these in a pack and get them
off of a
Vasudha they're just six glass bottles
that you can fill up with water and then
stick in this thing do you always have
cold water to drink I'm someone who
never used to drink enough water and for
some reason if it's cold and if it's in
a cute bottle and I can just take it
wherever I drink way more of these I
literally go through over six of these
in the day I almost always refill them
throughout the day save wasting plastic
by buying water bottle water bottle
bottled water and there is nothing that
feels better than when you get out of
the shower and you have a cold glass of
water waiting for you if you have issues
drinking water
try getting these bottles it helps so
that is everything let me know your
