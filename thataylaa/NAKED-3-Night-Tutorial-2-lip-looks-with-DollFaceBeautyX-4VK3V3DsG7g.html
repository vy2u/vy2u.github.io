look
but not just any night look people my
friend of money on YouTube it did the
day look using the Naked 3 palette so be
sure to go check out her Channel and
subscribe so this is a smokier evening
night look I did vamp it up a little bit
by using a black lip we switched it up
there's two lip options you can choose
whichever one you like best so we're
priming the eyes with Mac's painterly
paint-pot like always and I'm gonna go
in with it's Judy's time palette the
soft brown color in the middle and I did
redo my website completely and I'm going
to start listing all of the product info
on there so make sure you go check out
my website if you want to know what I'm
using so now I'm blending this in to the
crease this is gonna be our transition
color and there's a whole lot of
blending coming up so then we're gonna
take any black eyeliner you have and
just line the lids with this completely
fill them in this is gonna serve as a
base to deepen up the color and make it
stand out and we're just kind of
creating the shape that we want with our
eye you're gonna most likely look like
Ke$ha at this point but don't even worry
I've gives you a moment to look like
Ke$ha sees it so we are blending black
art over our lid right now and I'm just
using a flat shader brush to pack on
this color and then smooth it out a
little bit then I'm going to go in with
a nooner from The Naked 3 palette in a
second on a blending brush and just
completely blend out these edges you
really have to blend a lot this is the
key to this look you want that black to
not look harsh but to blend into nooner
so go to town on the blending people if
you're having a difficult time blending
you can always go back in with some more
nooner and that will help to blend
things out a little bit then I'm going
to go in with mugshot and I've never
used this color before it doesn't
particularly appeal to me in the palette
so I thought why not try and create a
look with it so I'm just patting that on
with my finger on the lid and then I
blend it out again and now we're going
in with the lightest shade in the
palette under the brow bone to brighten
everything up then I'm taking
nooner again on the sigma pencil brush
and smudging that on the lower lash line
and then taking dark side and blending
that in the outer third and then we want
this look really blended and sludge so
keep on blending I feel like I've said
that ten times now now I'm going in with
that black liner and lining my waterline
and then I'm gonna take trick on a small
smudge brush and I did spray this with
my urban decay settings for you to give
it a little more pigmentation in this
eyeshadow has a CH and a fall out so you
have to spray it with something for it
to stick and look more pigmented now I'm
going to create a dramatic wing with my
Holy Grail new favorite Physicians
Formula I booster liner this is amazing
bully bowl to create a little more
definition in the crease i'm going in
with black heart on a crease brush then
i applied some top and bottom mascara
and here's me with one eye
whoa now i have to ice now we're gonna
put on some lips
the first option we're doing a nude lip
i'm using the leftover foundation on my
brush to cancel out any natural
pigmentation in my lips and then I'm
going in with mates naked truth which is
my go-to nude color and then I'm using a
NYX lip gloss which I can't remember the
color but it will be on the website or
down below and then for option two you
just got to go for a black lip sometimes
you know you just have to so I'm using
Mac's hot core this was a limited
edition it is my baby it is my child and
I love it I get that the black vampy lip
isn't for everybody so that's why I did
the nude lip that is for you comment

better and be sure to check out my
