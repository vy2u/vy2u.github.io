today we have a review and kind of demo
on the new NARS all day luminous
weightless foundation I know this has
taken me literally forever to get up but
we're doing it now this actually isn't
even like new anymore like this has been
out for at least a month now we're going
to talk about it today if you want to
see the rest of my makeup on my face
right now I do have a shadow in shoes
get ready with me which I'll link over
here also link it in the down bar so you
can watch it watch it after this video
if you want to let's do it so just the
basic slipping on Sephora's website
right now this retails for $48 it does
come with a pump
how many shades is there on Sephora it
looks like there's 20 shades as far as
pale shades goes it looks like there are
kind of three that you can go for the
first one is Mont Blanc and it's light
with pink undertones I kind of Google
image all of the shades before I
purchased the shade that I thought would
work for me and this one looked the
lightest on Blanc is like super pink
people are saying and then go P which is
the next lightest shade is light with
yellow undertones the one I chose is
Siberia which is light with a neutral
balance of pink and yellow undertones I
don't think that's true at all this is a
straight up like yellow tone foundation
or someone like me it's just too yellow
right now I feel like it doesn't look
horrible but when you go outside and
natural lighting
it just looks straight-up yellow so it's
an oil-free foundation and you're
supposed to be able to achieve a full
coverage face little natural looking
coverage with one drop for full
lightweight 16 hour wear so I didn't
really find that any of that was true
for my skin just watching different
reviews and stuff I kind of feel like
this is one of those foundations that
some people either love or some people
absolutely hate and it just doesn't work
for them I think this is totally
dependent on your skin and just what
works for you on the box it says that
one pump of product should be enough for
a lightweight full coverage face that
wasn't true for me at all you guys will
see in the demo but one pump gave me
pretty light coverage just on one not
even half of my face just on like my
left cheek one pump might be doable for
you if you already have really nice skin
but for someone looking for more
coverage don't think this is the
foundation for you as far as the 16-hour
claim goes I
warned this a couple times for a full
day the thing that really bothered me
was that it just settled in all of my
lines it majorly looked caked up around
my nose and then gave me kind of like
the mouth lines I think part of that
might be because it's not designed to
have basically two to three layers of it
sounds like it's just supposed to be one
lightweight coat maybe if one pump is
enough for your whole face it wouldn't
do that but again for someone who needs
more coverage it just didn't work for
more mature skin I don't think this
would be a great foundation it'll
probably settle in your lines I don't
feel like I have a ton of wrinkles
but it settles into the ones that I
apparently do have that I didn't really
know I had for $48 I think this is one
of those foundations that is kind of up
to you you might either love this or you
might it might not work for you I'll
probably be returning this just because
I'm not completely in love with it and
the shade is just I feel like totally
off for me let me know down below if
this was one of the foundations that
worked for you or if you didn't like it
I'm curious to hear your thoughts I
think some people really love it and I
just wasn't one of those people so if
you want to see how this foundation
applies then you're in the right place
just keep watching all right so I've
already primed my face with the Laura
Mercier a foundation primer I mean
you've seen this every single day and I
actually really like it I think it was
one of the samples from glambot or
something and we're doing this my bottle
it's looking kinda interesting right now
so this is a foundation that you
definitely need to shake up first make
sure that the lid is on super tight when
you do this because actually shook it
and it went all over my carpet so that
was fun you can see it like separating
in the bottle so you do definitely want
to shake this thing you can hear it
super liquidy and it has a pump a plus
NARS so I'm in the shade Siberia you'll
see this is super super yellow on me I
haven't tried the sheer glow foundation
in Siberia but I've heard that this is
even yellower than that I wouldn't wear
this on its own but for the sake of the
video I'm going to wear it for you guys
so when you're working with this
foundation you definitely want to use
some kind of palette I just use the top
of a bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks candle they say
that one pump is supposed to cover your
entire face but that does not work for
me at all so I put about three pumps on
the back up here and that's how much you
get that's probably still not enough for
my face you want to put it on something
like a pallet because this is super
liquidy so if you put it on the back of
your hand
it'll just soak right in I like to use a
sigma f80 brush to blend this in I've
tried the Real Techniques miracle
complexion sponge and it literally just
soaked up everything so I'm just going
to go in and stipple my brush in here
let's just start I wish put my mirror
over here
if you can see it does a pretty decent
job covering everything but definitely
looks way more yellow than my neck does
obviously still have some issues going
on but it's a lot clearer than when I
tried this foundation a few weeks ago
when I did that time I had to apply
about three layers to get the kind of
coverage to cover acne right now it's
doing a pretty decent job but I still
would probably go in with a light second
layer but I used pretty much three pumps
on half of my face not even half of my
face so if I was just using a pump for
all this it wouldn't cover anything I'm
going to do one pump on the other side
so you can just see how much it would
cover so you can see the difference a
lot more showing through on this side
this side looks a lot more flawless it's
kind of one of those foundations where
in certain lights the tone the yellow
tone looks okay in another light so your
face just look straight up yellow so I'm
putting one pump for my forehead let's
just see how much that covers it settles
really strange on my forehead like all
of my bumps and all of my pores are
completely emphasized I don't know if
you guys can see that but it's not
looking too hot on my forehead if you
have any dry patches whatsoever
it's just clinging straight to it all
right so this is what the foundation
looks like with one application I
probably used six seven pumps total on
my face one pump they say is supposed to
cover your entire face that might work
if you have perfect skin to begin with
or someone that needs a full coverage
foundation and that's acne or acne
scarring and redness that you need to
cover this probably won't do anything
with one pump put one more pump out and
just go over the spots that need a
little more help yeah it just does not
sit well on my forehead at all I don't
know what's going on the second layer
definitely looks sugar than the first
layer did so here's the coverage that I
got with basically two layers I can
still see my freckles I can still see
some acne scarring peeking through over
here it just looks really crappy on my
forehead if you have any dry patches it
completely clings to it around my nose
it kind of has lines so I'm going to
apply the rest of my face makeup and eye
makeup and I'll be right back alright so
the rest of my makeup is
and it does look a lot better with
everything else on it doesn't want ads
like noticeably yellow but as far as the
actual formula goes and how it's looking
on my face it just doesn't look great
like I feel like it's emphasizing my dry
spots I already have lines around my
nose in my mouth I also found that on me
without a setting spray it doesn't look
super doing at all if anything it looks
more of like a matte natural finish on
my skin I do find that when i use my
l'oreal infallible Pro matte setting
spray it helps to kind of do things up a
little bit and look more natural for the
sake of video I didn't use that so you
can just see what it looks like I'm
going to do a close-up right now so you
can see kind of the lines and stuff I'm
talking about I don't know I'm just kind
of like blah so I hope this review was
helpful for you and you got to see how
it looked on my face sorry that this
took literally forever for me to get up
a lot of stuff is going on comment down
below with any foundations that you want
to see a review on next I will be
reviewing the hard candy glamoflauge
foundation so that will probably be
coming up next but let me know down
below what other foundations you guys
want to see again I do have a get ready
with me video on the look I'm wearing
right now so if you want to see how I
got the rest of my makeup I'll link that
video at the ends you can go and watch
