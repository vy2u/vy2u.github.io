one of 15 days of foundation this is the
third 15 days of foundation series have
been on my channel I do these every four
months ish it's a new foundation first
impression video every single day for 15
days if you missed it or you are new
here and you're just dumpling across
this video hello welcome to the burrito
fam I believe the length of the
announcement video down below that's
basically where I go through all the
information you will ever need to know
about this series about Project Beauty
shared t-shirts ebay shop where you can
purchase makeup 100% the proceeds are
going to project be do share there's
also playlist down below for each series
so if you missed any with the first two
you can go back and watch those in catch
up I feel like I have so much
information until you guys are noun you
know where to start the best way to
follow along with 15 days of foundation
is definitely on snapchat and Twitter
snap BAM knows what's up each night
after 15 days of foundation I do comment
shout outs on snapchat you can also send
in any photos with the hashtag 15 dates
of foundation on social media for a
chance to be featured in the video at
the end I'm pre recording these ishutin
so there's going to be the delay in the
first like 8 or 9 videos probably thinks
s everything had to say let's jump into
the foundation let's do this day 1 this
was one of the most requested
foundations this is the brand new
Natasha Genoa X foundation X full
coverage foundation let's read some of
the claims on Sephora so I've actually
never tried anything from Natasha Genoa
this will be my first product those
retails for $45 you get one point zero
one ounces of product 3 much standard
amount $45 is actually price pretty low
I feel like for Natasha de Nonna her
eyeshadow palettes retailed for $239 to
give you some perspective on this
product and just on life like London
Tasha Genoa is an internationally
renowned makeup artist I would go on her
website and read her biography because
it's really interesting she has a really
interesting background just go read it
and I kind of feel like we could be
friends Natacha Damona hit a girl up she
has a magic primer and the primer
retails for $55
so it's interesting this is actually
priced lower than the primer I'm not
complaining I was actually kind of
shocked I was expecting this to be more
in the $60 range $45 is obviously
high-end it's still pricey but it's not
up there with Giorgio Armani and some of
the other high-end brands this comes in
11 shades I have the lightest shade
which is 10 neutral fair it says on here
shade is suitable for all undertones I'm
gonna show you guys swatches you can see
how this foundation compares to some of
the other lightest foundations that I
own but off the bat I can tell you that
this one definitely is a bit more yellow
I wouldn't say that this is suitable for
all undertones especially if you're more
pink alright so swatch time right here
is the Natasha G Nona X foundation and
the lightest shade 10 next to is
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless in
110 and we have the pur cosmetics bear
doll foundation in the shade porcelain
the lightest shade derma called 2:08
urban decay naked skin in 0.5 and then
Tarte reinforces C in a lighter shade
porcelain so this is just to give you a
reference of some of the lightest shades
of other products and how much they vary
eleven shades not super great I'm
guessing that they'll expand the line so
says it's a long lasting full coverage
radiant foundation that doesn't settle
into fine lines and leaves the skin with
a naturally radiant flawless finish
never looks fixed dry or cakey on the
skin this full coverage foundation is
infused with special ingredients that
help balance the t-zone area and absorb
excess oils on the skin formulated to
support anti aging blah blah helped
defend against pollution I've seen so
many products lately with pollution
anti-pollution claims what's really
interesting this product is also cruelty
free so those are all the claims on this
product if you guys are excited for this
video and 15 days of foundation hell
yeah make sure you give this video a
thumbs up if you want to see how the
natasha de Nonna foundation foundation X
applies the more throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching she has a great last name
alright so it is 9:30 in the morning
it's Saturday when I'm filming this
can't believe it's day one our body
feels kind of crappy right now so if I'm
not totally with it that is why so in
any recent foundation videos pretty much
in the last six to eight months I'm
pretty sure I've been using the UA anti
blemish matte primer how and I'm out of
and I have so many primers I've been
trying to find one that works I didn't
want to use diff
primary sources series because they
didn't want to have any kind of added
variable so I asked you guys on snapchat
if you'd rather see no primer or if
you'd rather see me use the Laura
Mercier foundation primer in every
single video reason why I chose this one
is because I've used this for years I've
gone through a three or four bottles of
this I know how it performs I love it
the vast majority of you said you wanted
to see me use this primer since I do use
a primer on an everyday basis so I feel
like that makes the most sense as well
so we're going to be using this primary
throughout the whole series there's no
fancy name on here it literally just
says foundation primer feel like that's
kind of refreshing the names on products
now are so intense they have a project
that literally just says foundation
primer you go Laura Mercier say it like
it is definitely more coffee right now
take this thing out of the box I haven't
even looked at the packaging or anything
yet oh it's like a frosted glass bottle
light top and there is a pump like
usually I'm going to use a foundation
brush on one side of my face and then a
sponge on the other just to see if
there's a difference in application of
combination skin with cystic acne
clearly I get pretty oily throughout the
day this one does say it's supposed to
be oil controlling so that is promising
any foundation that says it's oil
controlling and all about this has a
really tiny spout like it's coming out
in miniscule pumps which makes me think
maybe you don't need a whole lot of
product and we start out with about dime
sized amount this is the elf ultimate
blending brush I usually use the elf
powder brush I just use it for
foundation this one is a bit more flimsy
so if I don't like it with this brush
I'll just switch to another brush I have
high hopes for this so let's just
stipple this Alon go to town folks Oh
feels very lightweight actually think of
my switch brushes the skills a little
bit flimsy and tries my normal health
brush it looks a bit yellow shade wise
it feels super lightweight like it
almost doesn't feel like you have
anything on this transferring right now
but could just be because it's not set
yet so you stuff that whole amount so
I'm going to add a tiny bit more for the
forehead this is definitely looking like
a matte finish with the brush it just
has a naturally radiant flawless finish
it doesn't say if it's supposed to be
more matte or dewy or anything what the
brush is looking a little bit dry in
certain
so I'm going to try the sponge on the
other side I definitely like how this
applies better with the sponge and it's
just way quicker the finish with a
sponge is looking like flawless matte
but doesn't look heavy or dry and I'm
getting about the same coverage I
actually feel like I'm getting better
coverage with a sponge which is kind of
rare for me I usually get a bit better
coverage with a brush I would say I got
pretty much full coverage on this side
what I said I would say is high medium
coverage to show you guys up close
actually so you can still see my skin
coming through freckles and stuff this
side looks like it has a bit higher
coverage to me I think my forehead looks
good the center of the forehead looks
pretty good I'm going to go in for a
second later on just the areas that I
need a bit more coverage and we will see
if this thing is buildable actually not
building the best since it almost has
like a powder finish when you build this
one it looks a bit textured definitely
looks heavier when you build it than it
does on just a first layer it's covering
better for sure now we're at total full
coverage just looking at it normal
length away it doesn't look horrible or
anything but when you get up close you
can see it just kind of looks like you
already have a powder on it definitely
will not be powdering my face with this
because it is supposed to be oil
controlling I want to see how that works
and because it's already a pretty much
powder finish I mean it looks pretty
good even with that second layer the
shade is definitely a little bit off for
me it's always hard to tell into these
lights but my neck is definitely more
pink I love how lightweight it feels it
kind of just feels like you have a
powder foundation on when I touch my
face not transferring as much at all as
before so I think you just have to give
it a few minutes to set down so right
now it is 948 well so tell fast so I'm
gonna do the rest of my makeup like I'm
forgetting something that was just
really quick so I'm gonna do the rest on
makeup and I'll be right back
alright so it's now 1007 so we're going
to call the check-in time ten o'clock
since pretty much when I finished up my
face and everything so I did not set my
face with the powder since this does dry
down to more of a powder finish like I
said I think if you put a powder on top
it would have to be a very finely milled
kind of lightweight powder or else I
feel like it could look a bit powdery
but I did set my face using the Catrice
Prime and fine setting spray I'm almost
out of this I was looking a tiny bit dry
on my forehead and certain parts of my
face and once
a setting spray on it just kind of
helped to get rid of that right now my
skin is looking great
soft matte finish I didn't spot conceal
anywhere so the coverage you're seeing
is all the foundations the only area
where it doesn't look great great is
around my nose is looking a little bit
creepy
hopefully that doesn't get worse
throughout the day right now I mean it's
barely noticeable but when you get it
close I can see I tried to warm up my
face a lot so the shade doesn't look
quite as off one of the issues I have
with foundations that set to kind of a
powder finish is that when I put on my
under eye concealer sometimes it gets
weird textured since you're basically
putting a liquid on top of a powder and
that didn't happen at all with this so
that was a good sign my under eyes look
good it's not sitting weird on top of
the foundation or anything blush bronzer
highlight everything blended out great
on top since you're pretty much putting
it on top of the powder so i'mma tell
you guys what's on the rest my face so
for a bronzer I actually used a face
powder this is the Burberry warm honey
that's what it looks like I also use
this on the crease in my eyes for
blushes the Sigma blush in peacefull
highlight it's my favorite and since
eyeshadow and snowflake I'm obsessed
with this this is a couple bucks and
it's amazing as a highlight as I use the
milk makeup pigment in hotel lobby I
want to like these I keep trying to make
them work they just don't work for me
not a fan of these had to put something
on top of it so I went in with this
shade right here which is actually a
highlight but it worked as eyeshadow but
I do mascara is my usual Too Faced
presence X Wet n Wild mega links and
then lips I used Rimmel 32 innocent
liner this is great I love this shades
and on top I put the MUA lip gloss in
the shade baby pink like I said it is
Saturday I'm actually going to work from
the coffee works from a coffee shop
today the next check and I do will be in
natural lighting in a few hours so I'll
check back in with you guys then alright
so it smells 420 and some foundations on
for six and a half hours check it in a
little late great to see even repeats
over here
we're in ELQ I just worked from a place
over here and I don't think it looks
that great
what do you
now it's not the best one you've ever
had yeah it looks a little bit kinky to
me like I actually noticed an hour in
why everyone shields my purse all right
no actually no it's an hour and it
started creasing on my upper lip
literally an hour after I've had it on
before even left and it just looks kinda
heavy to me for not having a powder on
at all feel like you guys can see the
texture there for only being on for six
and a half hours so far not great I also
feel like my forehead looks kind of dry
or something is going on so I'm going to
keep this on I'll check back in with you
guys at the end of the night about 8:20
so the Foundation's been on for a little
over 10 hours and I feel like it's kind
of hard to look totally bad under the
ring light and I feel like it does so
for most of the final check-ins during
this series I'm going to be doing it in
the bathroom lighting because I feel
like it's a bit more realistic but my
canon g7x blogging camera that I'm going
to be using hasn't come in yet I should
get it in like a day or two so until
then I'm just going to use my good
camera under the lights not looking
great I would say it literally looked
good for the first hour maybe and then
from there it just started looking
heavier and cakier just looked cakey and
powdery to kind of rubbed off like you
can see down here on this side of my
face and also over here kind of where I
rest my hands it's totally off right
there
it kind of just looks a bit patchy to me
here's where it's rubbed off over here
it just doesn't look great at all
everything just looks kind of splotchy
and patchy to me bit of cakiness
increasing around the nose area there's
a bit of separation on the center of my
forehead it's looking better under this
light for sure but hopefully guys can
see this but it's kind of settling into
the wrinkles on my forehead up here
these lines because you have more mature
skin or any kind of wrinkles this will
probably settle into it because I have
pretty fine lines on my forehead right
now and it definitely is creasing there
yeah
like look around this area just looks
very happy so I think this is one of
those that I liked when it went on I
liked for the first hour and then it
just kind of went downhill from there
for me I definitely would not wear this
one again I don't think I would even mix
this in with another product so
hopefully day two we'll have a better
foundation so
