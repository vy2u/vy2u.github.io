when you read them all right so today it
is foundation Friday I'm going to be
trying out another new drugstore release
the drug store has been cranking them
out lately the last two Friday's have
been a brand new drugstore foundation
releases as well and lay the foundation
Friday sale is down below so you can go
watch those if they were to be talking
about the wet and wild photo focus
foundation they also came out with new
concealer powder everything my Walgreens
didn't have this yet I've seen photos of
Walgreens displays right now with all
the wet and wild releases and they're
literally giant displays with all new
products so I'm still in the hunt for
the rest of the new products quickly
Before we jump in the foundation I'm
going to be doing another shadow minions
video and I really like the Q&amp;amp;A style
last time and I think you guys did too
if you have any questions that you want
answered in my next shoutout smooth you
can leave them down below in the
comments that's where I want to be
pulling questions from this time around
so if you have any thing you want
answered comment down below a bandeau is
coming off right now you just need to
chill for like ten more minutes this has
one fluid ounce of product in that
standard for liquid foundation and it
retails for $5.99 on wet wilds website
you can find wet and wild almost always
40% off at CVS and writing they just
push out their sales so the awesome
thing about this product is that it
comes in 20 shades rarely as a drugstore
do we see that kind of shade selection
be released
I think the L'Oreal True Match line is
probably one of the only liquid
foundation lines of the drugstore that
has that kind of shade range not sure if
every single store is going to be
carrying all 20 shades
probably not but online you can find 20
shades let's see some of the claims that
says your skin only better our new
high-performing skin perfecting
foundation
underwent major road testing under 7
different photo lighting conditions to
deliver flawless camera-ready makeup
every time their whole thing on this is
that it's supposed to be amazing for
flash photography selfies
anything that evolve photos basically to
give your skin a matte like confusing
complexion if they what kind of coverage
is supposed to be or what skin types to
support and to lighter shade porcelain
here I also have the 32 lightest shade
soft ivory some assert swatches right
now so you can see how it BJ's compared
you some of the other lighter shades of
foundation I on all right dark cents
right here we have the wet and wild
photo focus foundation in porcelain next
over is wet and round so to focus in
soft ivory this is the etude house big
cover BB foundation which is my closest
shade mashes in the lightest shade Urban
Decay Naked skin foundation and 0.5 this
is the brand-new Tarte rainforest of the
sea foundation in the lightest shade
which is new porcelain and then this is
our old lighter shade which is fair
neutral if you guys like foundation
Friday videos and you're excited give
this video a thumbs up if you want to
see how the wet and wild photo focus
foundation applies and wear throughout
the day here on the right what's up
you're in the right place just keep
watching
alright so it is exactly 8 o'clock in
the morning everybody wash moisturize
prime my face I use my age way anti
blemish matte primer like normal on
their website it looks like soft ivory
is actually it's not the second to
lightest shade it looks like it's third
over so I think I am going to go in with
porcelain here on it this has my face
I'm use my Sigma f80 kabuki blood blush
and then on the other side needs my
Black Beauty Blender so let's shake this
doesn't sound like wa t it all sounds
pretty sick don't okay so this
actually has a little spatula thing you
probably you just put on the back of
your hand if it's clean and then dip
your brush in there or on a pallet but
I'm just going to pour a little bit out
on a pallet I'm gonna start with this
amount I'm not sure how much coverage is
supposed to be as you see it is running
a little bit but it doesn't look super
super runny or super thick so let's go
in okay it smells like straight-up ink
literally and for those of you who say
that my foundation is too light
sometimes I swear to god it is the
lighting when I look in the mirror in
here my face matches my neck I figured
out that with the lights you need
something to reflect underneath your
chin so that it reflects the same amount
of light because right now there's
basically shadow from here on down so I
have ordered a two more cluster off of
Amazon it is coming you think after four
years on your to budge figure the shadow
that went on really easily add amount of
product covered half my face pretty much
perfectly so with the brush it looks
like we got about high medium coverage
almost actually full coverage I think so
I put a little bit more on a second
layer I would get full coverage we'll
see let's go in with the beauty blender
on this side and see how well it covers
looking a little bit dry on my forehead
but we'll see once we have everything on
I wish they just put a pump on here
instead of a spatula next time Beauty
Thunder time holy okay that's just
totally soaked up everything in this
sponge is a damp sponge yeah that just
completely soaked up that entire amount
that is cut out my favorite sponge is
the Real Techniques sponge but that one
is in the office I need to get a second
one to have here
yeah well this scent is I feel like I'm
putting house paint on my face right now
this is bringing back my painting
furniture phase if you guys have been
with me since college when I used to
redo furniture a lot comment down below
the most popular video today is how to
paint furniture without sanding insects
just use up that amount again so let's
go in with a little bit more on the
forehead with a sponge I'm going to say
for me I don't know if it's this sponge
or what but I'm going to stick with the
brush for this one because all of my
products is just disappearing with this
so coverage wise on one layer I did get
better coverage with the brush for sure
and it soaked up way less product it
used about twice the amount of products
on this side and it didn't actually go
onto my face it's just chilling in here
so I'm going to go in with the second
layer just to see if I can get this
totally full coverage incited looking
like medium coverage this is looking
like high medium coverage almost full
coverage it is clinging on some of my
dry patches on my forehead let's go in
with the tiny second layer with the
brush face it bill I wanna know what is
in this so it's causing it to smell like
this so this is building and I'd say
we're at almost this side looks a lot
more full coverage with that first layer
with the brush this one still is a
little totally full coverage of the
second layer he does look on my forehead
like it kind of is sitting on top of my
skin so I'm going to go in with the
sponge just to smooth out the texture a
little bit and see if we can that hooked
a little bit just looking really dry on
my forehead finish I would say fellas
satin matte not to do we not too matte
has them
kind of stops ascetics finish the finish
of this almost looks like the Sonia
Kashuk soft-focus foundation which I
have a whole review on that I'm debating
setting this one with the powder because
it's supposed to be good for flash
photography and selfies and all that
kind of stuff we are going to do a photo
test and I don't really want the powder
to throw that off but this one isn't
totally feeling like it needs the powder
and then I will see I'm going to do the
rest of my makeup but right now it is
815 I just saw my under-eye concealer
and powder and I don't know why but the
tart shaped aid concealer went on
flawlessly on top of this it just
blended out really nicely on top of the
foundation so I'm gonna do a flash
that's on my iPhone on their website set
that when they just flash test to use
iPhone success and the galaxies properly
before started exploding on planes I'm
assuming I'm gonna do one front facing
and then one back
books these are very attractive photos
but the first one the front camera flash
looks like there is ZERO flashback
whatsoever the second one I think it's
just under my eyes that I'm seeing with
some flashback
so not horrible alright so it is now
8:30 and the rest of the makeup is on
and not end up setting this with the
powder mostly because there are certain
parts on my face that look very dry and
it did set feels a tiny tiny bit tacky
but for the most part it feels pretty
set blending blush bronzer and highlight
on top was totally fine my bandage it's
like coming off right now classy but I
did use a setting spray I always use a
setting spray every single day if I
don't mention it I'm using it switch off
between setting sprays today use Urban
Decay all nighter but if you have dry
skin
I think off the bat this one probably
will emphasize your dry patches just
because I really have minimal dry
patches and it's looking like I have a
lot other than that it looks really nice
and smooth right now I'm liking it and
quickly tell you when I fit on the rest
of my face for bronzer use of Sigma lime
light bronzer here it is flush the
toothpaste sweet peach flush mass
mineralized skinfinish and soft and
gentle note in light space for my
highlight Too Faced presents dark
mascara like always I don't mention what
mascara I'm using it's always two-faced
presence X and then my lips are the
tarts I always want to say TARDIS TARDIS
lip paint and namaste with this butter
LONDON gloss this is from our new
Pantone collection this is in the shade
buttercream and it's like this super
light a little bit duochrome lip gloss
and I love it on top of here so that is
what I'm wearing I didn't do intend to
makeup today because I have to go take
my car in so I'm going to take my car
and probably work from a coffee shop
over there or bring my laptop I'm not
sure when the next type of time is going
to be but we're going to do it in
natural lighting so I don't check back
to you guys in a few hours okay so I
just ended up getting home it is now
3:30 so if foundation is gone for 7
hours I usually check in at like the
four or five hour point first but this
is just how the dig is going for bang on
for seven hours
it looks frickin bomb right now my only
critique is that it is majorly creasing
on my upper lip and I noticed that about
four hours in it started really creasing
this is like a full-on line hasn't
gotten oily at all in my forehead you
think there's certain parts
on my forehead where it just doesn't
look quite as smooth as I'd like it like
you can see a little bit of texture and
stuff coming through and just dry
patches dry patches are less known to
school them when I first put it on tagra
face looks like I just fell in a few
hours ago I think overall for being on
for seven hours right now it's looking
really great so that's my thought seven
hours in I wish I'd back with you guys
at the end of the night okay so snow and
9 o'clock so the Foundation's been on
for over 12 hours 12 and a half hours
for being on for 12 and a half hours
I think it's held up pretty dang well as
far as oil for not sending with a powder
this is just very good for me oil wise I
had worn off down here a bit some acne
is coming through on the sides like
where my fingers were I think it looked
really good up until about the nine ten
our points at that point I do think now
it looks like it's breaking down around
my nose and the center of my forehead it
doesn't look great
it looks pretty cakey around the centre
of my face you know it held up really
well with my oil there was something
about the finish of it it just didn't
look very skin-like to me look a tiny
tiny bit heavy and just with the dry
patches and everything I'm not totally
in love with how it sat on my skin even
though it did hold up really well so I
think next time I use this I would
probably mix it in with something a
little more skin like our tree
presidency or a cosmetics CC cream I
think for a few bucks this could be
worth giving a go if you have any skin
type besides dry so if you guys liked
