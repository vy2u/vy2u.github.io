happy foundation Friday if you're new
here this is where I test out a new book
got an eyebrow edge foundation Fridays
where I test out a new foundation every
single Friday I'm gonna like the
playlist down below if you've missed any
of the videos if you ever want to know
if I've done a review on a foundation
all you gotta do is search the Tayla and
then the foundation name in the youtube
search box and it'll bring it right up
if I have it crazy today I'm gonna be
trying out the brand new anastasia
beverly hills stick foundation i heard
about this from instagram and as soon as
i saw that she was coming out with a
 ton of shades i was stoked and i
ordered this the day that i launched on
her website since I ordered this right
when I came out the lightest shade was
porcelain at the time so that's what I
ordered but they actually now have two
lighter shades they have alabaster and
warm alabaster which I guess they
released after there are now 28 shades
available on her website swatch I am
right here is the Anastasia Beverly
Hills stick foundation in porcelain next
over is the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
stick foundation in 115 this is
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless in
110 this is the cover of X CLIC stic
foundation in n 10 and this is Mac
Studio Fix in NW 10 so in this stick
foundation you get 0.32 ounces of
product in this retails for $25 I feel
like that's kind of hard to comprehend
without some kind of comparison just to
give you an idea of prices per ounce the
Make Up For Ever stick foundation is
0.44 ounces and retails for $43 so if
you break down the price per ounce about
98 cents per ounce and the Anastasia
Beverly Hills stick foundation is 78
cents per ounce so this is a better deal
price per ounce wise both that being
said you'll see in the demo I do feel
like you have to apply more of this than
you do the makeup every stick foundation
so definitely go through this faster I
feel like I love that there are so many
different shades
it looks like the deep shades actually
go pretty deep and the fair shades
definitely go super fair I wish I had
the two lightest shades just to swatch
for you guys but you'll see when I
swatch this foundation
is pretty fair which is awesome so it
says it's a highly pigmented buildable
cream formula leaves a natural matte
finish applies an all-over Foundation
sheared out as a tinted moisturizer or
for highlighting and contouring on
Sephora it says it's a medium to full
coverage its essence ideal for
combination or oily skin i've
combination skin with cystic acne i
usually get it kind of oily in my t-zone
throughout the day I never touch up
throughout the day I just like to put my
foundation on in the morning go about my
life have it stay on my face a lot of
movies I've seen have been raving about
this product has mixed reviews on
Sephora so I'm curious to see what I
think of this by the end of the day also
in this video I'm trying out the tarp
tarp tarp it's in a flashback to
elementary school and you'd like put
that ball in that big tarp and everyone
had to like throw it up okay moving on
the tart shaped tape concealer everyone
has been raving about this I finally was
able to get my hands on it I also want
to announce in this video if you saw the
best and worst of 15 days of foundation
I mentioned we're going to be doing
another 50 days foundation series every
few months on my channel which I know a
lot of you guys are super excited about
I'm super excited about October has
turned out to be insane I just have a
ton of stuff going on so there's
literally no way I'll be able to film 15
days foundation for October so we're
going to be doing the next 15 days
foundation in November November 5th to
the 20th I am just gonna be bracing
myself for 15 days can't believe we're
doing this again if you guys like this
video and our site at about 50 is
foundation and foundation Friday if you
just love foundation give this video a
thumbs up if you're new here you can
join the baby toe family and subscribe
let's get into the video we've got the
coffee which I need to drink ASAP I've
already primed my face with the jouer
anti blemish matte primer so you guys
have know so my skin's been doing better
than usual I don't know if it's one of
my phases where it's good for a few
weeks and then a ton of acne will pop up
again but all I've changed is my primer
I started using this and the Peter
Thomas Roth thing is called H a night
repair so I've got this bad boy right
here I'm going to be applying one half
of my face with the brush I'm using this
elf brush because this is my favorite
one to apply stick foundations typically
I have a bunch of different reviews
on stick foundations I will link some of
them down below on the other half of my
face I'll be using this sponge ooh
rose-gold super pretty packaging feels
like a nice quality stick doesn't feel
like cheap plastic or anything actually
cat feels a little cheap but rose gold
makes up for it do you have a little bit
of color on me right now I just got back
from Mexico and San Diego and I had
self-tanner on and last night I tried to
fully scrub it all off but I do feel
like I have a little bit of color left
over so I'm just going to apply how I
normally apply stick foundation I use
quite a bit to get the kind of coverage
I like that's usually my amount so let's
try the sponge first on this side of my
face okay right off the bat it doesn't
blend as easy as the makeup forever
stick foundation applying major pressure
to blend this out you can still see all
of my acne pretty much coming through so
definitely not full coverage with this
sponge with that amount I'm gonna try
the other side of my face and then we'll
definitely have to go in to build this
up it does say this is buildable oh
perhaps take a before photo we're gonna
have to do a in action shot yeah this
definitely feels stiffer than the makeup
forever stick foundation that one blends
out super effortlessly this one
you really gotta blend in so off the
first layer this isn't full coverage and
completely still see even freckles
coming through it did cover up the
redness pretty well and helped like even
out my skin tone but as far as acne all
the acne even on this side too with the
brush is still coming through so let's
do the forehead and then I'm probably
going to have to go back in for a second
layer it just doesn't blend out that
nicely if you like keep in mind that the
lights are making it look more flawless
and it actually is but you can still see
acne coming through here freckles
scarring even my forehead which doesn't
have a whole lot of problem areas on it
doesn't look totally flawless or like
full coverage shade wise for me right
now it looks a little bit light I think
just because I still have some color
okay so let's try and build this guy up
and when I use the makeup forever stick
foundation when I
by this amount of product that gets me
full coverage I don't go in for a second
layer with that foundation since you
have to really blend this I almost feel
like I'm wiping away some of the product
on the second layer you can't just like
stipple you really have to buff it still
not full coverage I would say that this
is medium coverage with two layers on my
skin the mine I have a lot more to cover
up than your average beauty guru my lips
are so dang dry right now what's going
on the way that this blends out kinda
reminds me of the cover FX stick
foundation the click stick thing that I
did a first impression on during 15 days
of foundation so we have two layers on
right now first thoughts not as much
coverage as I would like you can see
something like texture on my forehead
I'm just going to go over it with the
sponge and just pounce as you didn't get
rid of that no with the amount of
product I applied I would like it to be
a little bit more full coverage I feel
like I had to use a ton of product
just to get a medium coverage so I'm
going to try out the shape tape
concealer by Tarte for the first time on
camera because why not I've been
tweeting about this non-stop they've
literally been sold out for weeks on
Ulta tarte made this exclusive Dolton
and then it was sold out for forever so
I finally got my hands on this online I
have the lightest shade which is fair
people have been raving about this
concealer so I'm excited to see what I
think about it well this is freaking
huge I think this is the most giant
concealer that I own I'm the answers in
here there's 0.33 fluid ounces let's see
how much is in naked in my Urban Decay
Naked concealer there's only 0.16 so
this is literally double that which is
awesome woah huge s1 this reminds me of
the Clinique foundation wand a little
bit so I'm just going to go ahead and
apply I don't know how much we need of
this maybe should start when I
huh typically I like to just use my
finger to apply this concealer under the
eyes it feels nice and creamy but not
too creamy or it's like totally sliding
around feels like is starting to set and
the shade looks light it feels super
lightweight but I'm getting really good
coverage formula it definitely feels a
lot more lightweight to me and like thin
than the Urban Decay Naked skin like I
almost feel like I could not set this
with a powder since I like a tiny bit
more coverage on my face I'm going to
apply a tiny bit down the bridge shiny
nose chin just like a super tiny amount
in forehead a little bit goes a long way
so far really like in the concealer I
really feel like it's almost drying like
matte which is awesome
I am almost wondering if I should set
this or not I might hold off on setting
my face and do the rest of my makeup and
if I feel like I need to apply some
setting powder to the under eyes I will
is creasing on my eyelid a little bit so
the foundation doesn't feel totally set
but it also doesn't feel like it's like
sliding around I think I could get away
with not setting this as well and it is
supposed to be for oily skin so I have
combination oily skin I tend to get oily
throughout the day especially on my
t-zone so I kind of want to see how the
product wears alone without a setting
powder so I don't think I'm going to set
my face might set my under eyes we will
see it's now 754 so 8:00 a.m. I'm
playing the rest my makeup and I will be
right back all right so it's now 8:14 in
the morning rest of my makeup is on and
I'll tell you what I used in a second
but I did have to use a little bit of
setting powder because it felt like
finish wise it should be fine to blend
out blush and bronzer on top but it got
super super patchy and I ended up having
to go over it with a setting powder to
like blend it out so I use a tiny bit of
the cosmetics celebration foundation
illumination barely put any on the
center of my face mostly just
concentrate that on my cheek area to
blend everything out and this powder
also helped to warm up my face a little
bit since it is a little bit dark I
think I could actually go shade up
this foundation will see in the winter
when I'm like my pelas self but I do
think I could go a shade up which is
promising because that means that there
are three shades that are super pale I
think without a highlight and without
settings where I use the next duty
finish which I've been using every day
without that my face looks pretty dead
it looked pretty dry you have dry skin I
definitely would stay away from this one
I did feel nice like it feels like skin
but as far as to finish it looked kind
of like satin finish but with some
texture and like dry patches right now
it's looking good with everything that I
put on alone I wasn't that into it so
for eyes I just did a super simple kind
of pinky matte eye using this BH
Cosmetics modern mattes that was called
modern mattes 28 color eye shadow
palette this is like super cheap and the
quality was actually really nice their
shimmer palette is amazeballs I need to
do a look with that because I don't
think I've ever shown it on YouTube but
it rocks also use this BH Cosmetics and
bronzer in the shade tranquil tan I'm
like 99% sure my face would look like
crap right now if it weren't for this
highlight this is the color pop
flexitarian it's one their new
highlights and you guys this thing is
frickin amazeballs look at that
highlight concealer I didn't end up
setting which is a miracle it looks
great it's not creasing looks super
natural under my eyes really like the
concealer so far and then on my lips is
essence eyeliner and natural nude note
in the nude 11 with Mac flush pie over
top alright so up close here's what it
looks like like I said with the powder
and highlight I think it looks 50 times
better than it did without my try and do
the next check-in in natural lighting so
you guys can see the texture and stuff
but this is why it's looking like right
now so like I said it's about 8:15 in
the morning and go work from a coffee
shop for a few hours and then and I have
chiropractic at 1:30 I'm going to try
and check in before then because usually
when I go there I'm like face down and
my makeup gets all messed up but I guess
we'll see how it wears you have
foundations that we're fine after
chiropractic so we'll see how this one
holds up we're really putting it to the
test okay so it's not 12 o'clock so
foundations been on for about 4 hours
I thought we check in in
natural lighting it's super gloomy out
today and raining and I'm pretty stoked
about it I'm so ready for fall right now
so nothing major to report at this point
for our mark looks pretty good a little
bit of creasing around my nose area but
nothing on my upper lip my forehead
looks good I feel like my forehead
actually looks better than when I first
applied it for me this isn't enough
coverage I like a little bit more
coverage so that covers up all my apnea
stuff down here let's get up close and
personal I think it looks pretty nice on
the forehead right now you can
definitely see my pores like they're
looking pretty large now that I'm
looking at it in the camera all right so
it is now 5:17 p.m. so the Foundation's
been on for nine hours I look totally
different right now because I'm about to
film another video but before I do that
I had to film this final check-in
because I gotta fix this face situation
before we film the next one so I would
say it looked good up until about the
five-hour point from there on it just
started majorly breaking down looks
super cakey and my pores look giant
around my nose I am super oily on my
forehead around here on my chin pretty
much everywhere I was in Nordstrom to
return something they typically have
pretty good lighting and even in there
it looked super kinky for being for oily
skin I feel like I look oily er than I
typically do and I have foundations that
I can wear and I don't have to set at
all this is just ridiculously oily I
wasn't doing anything like strenuous I
haven't been sweating even at the
chiropractor I told her I didn't want my
face to get messed up so I didn't go
facedown at all and it still is like
completely breaking down around my nose
area I'm going to show you guys a
close-up right now so you can see what
I'm talking about
okay so I've turned down the light so
hopefully you guys can see this but look
at how freaking giant my pores look it
looks super heavy right here like I feel
like I could dig my nail in it does not
look great around this area at all
my under eye concealer looks amazing for
not setting it on my
guys this looks freaking great I'm oily
right here and it's breaking down a
little bit and then the forehead is just
like a hot mess look at how frigging
oily this is the lights are like almost
all the way turned down right now
so you can get an idea how oily this is
out major glare does not look great you
can see all my pores up here just look
super textured I've seen some rave
reviews on this product so this could
just be one that didn't work with my
skin like I always say watch different
videos form your own opinions this is
just my personal opinion but with that
being said I would not recommend this
foundation I don't like this one I don't
think it held up well I don't think it
looked incredible when I first applied
it and it just kind of went downhill
throughout the day so I would say save
your twenty five bucks on this one
if you tried this and you found a good
way to apply it or a good setting powder
or whatever let me know if you guys
liked this video and you're excited
about foundation Friday and make sure
you give it a thumbs up you always let
me know down below your foundation
suggestions I also do snapchat pulls a
lot of times where I'll ask you guys
which one you want to see in the coming
week so if you're not following me on
snapchat it's the tail of snaps you can
go cast your vote love you guys thanks
for watching see you in my next video
