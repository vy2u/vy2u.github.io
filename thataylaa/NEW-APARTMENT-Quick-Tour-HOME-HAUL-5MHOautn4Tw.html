our new apartment right now I am so
excited I'm just kind of slowly moving
 in here I have stuff in like three
different places right now so it's going
to be a while until I'm fully moved in
but I thought I would do kind of like a
vlog show you guys around the new
apartment kind of thing and let me know
down below if you want to see kind of
home hulls and things like that as I
move everything in so here's the front
door when you walk in this is kind of
the hallway that you see the bathrooms
to the right I have a rug in here and
some toilet paper and stuff like that
that I just moved in this rug is from
Ross I think it was like $12.99 it's
super soft and it's going with kind of
like the dark gray light gray kind of
theme so these are the towels I have I
pretty much got everything from like
Ross and TJ Maxx I forgot about this
brand we don't have our shower rod in
yet I don't know where that is I have to
ask our apartment manager about that all
of like the tub and sink and everything
or bring a new kind of unit so that's
super nice because our apartments
actually pretty old and then there's a
 ton of storage space back here so
when you open this up this obviously
needs to be cleaned but there's a ton of
storage space in here which is super
nice so we can just put it all of our
bathroom stuff in here so that's pretty
much the only room that like has
anything in it right now this is our
third roommates room it's pretty big and
it has a super nice window with a really
pretty view that's what I love about
this apartment all of the rooms have
like really good sized windows and
there's a lot of natural light coming
through which I really like this room
leads into this like walk-in closet and
this is actually it's kind of funky this
is what connects to the other room so
this is where Rach is going to be this
room is a little bit smaller obviously
her bed I think is going to be like over
here then she can fit like maybe a
bookshelf and desk and stuff over there
she also has a really pretty view and
then you walk into this area which this
is supposed to be the living room since
we're having three people in a two
in house we're making like a makeshift
bedroom and that's what my room is going
to be but it's hardwood floors which I
really like the only downside is that
race has to walk through my room to get
to light the kitchen and living room and
stuff right there so that's going to be
kind of shitty in the morning I don't
know we haven't really figured that out
yet but what I'm super super excited
about is my filming room so that door on
the left is Rachel's room and then this
is my room right now and then walking in
here this is my filming room so I'm so
freaking excited about this I'm going to
have a whole room just dedicated to you
guys most apartments don't have what I
realize is kind of ugly this is a super
spacious apartment we got super lucky
for what we're paying and it's in a
really good area I never thought that I
would have a filming room like what the
 basically this is probably the
background you guys are going to be
seeing I'm debating whether or not I
want to paint the walls because it looks
like you see a little bit of it I might
just like wallpaper it I don't know but
there's these two huge windows right
here and it's just such a great space
yeah I'm stoked but basically I'm going
to curtain off starting from that door
all the way over here so that's going to
be kind of my wall since there are
clearly no doors or walls in here so
Lauren can still walk through there
raesha is going to have to walk through
my room right there which is you know
whatever here's my purse so this is our
dining room area slash living room since
we don't have a living room so this is
what the space looks like I think we're
going to put the couch along this wall
and then maybe put a TV or something
over in this unit I don't know but look
how frigging cute that is like that's
just built into the wall so then when
you walk into here this is where the
kitchen is you know standard kitchen
nothing too exciting here actually this
is kind of exciting there's this little
area over here where we might put like
barstools and stuff we're just in such a
good area like we seriously lucked out
so I think I'm going to attempt to like
set this camera on something so I can
film a mini haul for you guys oh four
and a half
Neal hope I'm in focus right now I
really am starting to think I might need
glasses because I cannot see the
viewfinder at all from here I've kind of
been like slowly buying things over the
last couple weeks sorry I'm like
hardcore sweating right now it's
literally 95 degrees right now and
there's no a/c or fans if you follow my
lavaca see page you can see kind of the
room theme I'm going for I also have a
Pinterest board on it it's the black and
white room one I'll link all of them
down below but I really want to do a
like pretty much all black and white
room I just don't really like colors
really I'm hoping that I'll be able to
paint the walls this room would be okay
to paint because it's small but that
room would probably take me like I don't
know I just don't have the time for it
right now I really want all white walls
oh no that's we're gonna have to see how
badly I want it anyways so the first
thing is I got this duvet cover and
duvet insert I was looking at target for
duvet covers and all of them were super
expensive and I was like I can probably
find something half the price on Amazon
that's just as good if not better and I
did so this is the natural comfort hotel
selection down duvet insert it's machine
washable and it has a heavy fill so I'll
be good for the winter here it was like
$45 only everything that I can down
below in the ones at Target we're
starting at like 80 and then the sheets
I got I'm obsessed with these are also
from Target these were like literally
exactly what I was looking for I love
like black and white
the little X's and stuff and this is
from the room essentials line and it's
exactly that super excited about that so
then going with the bedding theme we
have two pillow shams another black and
white cross one and I got this off of
Etsy I'll link the SE seller down below
and I'll put
right here also got another pillow sham
which I will also put the Etsy seller
right here
I think awesome awesome like home decor
kind of things and it's not stuff that
you can find in like Target or TJ Maxx
or stuff like that I do need to get the
pillow inserts obviously then I have
this white pillow that I ended up
getting from TJ Maxx I think or Ross
know Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond this was
originally $40 and I got it for $9.99 on
clearance my feet hurt so bad who load I
do this so then I have this rug and it's
like a long I don't even know what you
pull these like a runner rug it's super
long I think I'm going to put it in
front of my dresser which I don't even
have a dresser yet I have a vision in my
mind of how this is gonna look I got
this from home goods for $30 kind of
what I was thinking for the wallpaper if
I did wallpaper in here feel like that
would look really cool if you guys saw
that on both sides I can't tell if this
is black me and the guy at the cash
register were kind of having a
discussion about this black or dark blue
sometimes it looks super black and
sometimes I'm like
it's blue so behind my bed I think I'm
going to do just like a bunch of picture
frames and wall art and stuff like that
kind of like I had in my old room
and so I got this picture from Ross for
$7.99 I might need to get some color I
don't know all right so the last thing I
have to show you guys is floor lamp from
room essentials I realized that there's
actually no lighting installed in my
bedroom and the only light coming in is
this natural light from this window so
I'm going to have to light up the place
a lot this one is from Target it was
like nine dollars super reasonable it's
just like a metal post with the white
land light bulbs super exciting oh why
am I not sitting on things that better
no oh so much better so that was
everything that I brought in from my car
let me know down below if you guys like
this kind of like apartment blog I don't
even know this is like a fall vlog thing
let me know if you guys want to see more
apartment kind of things there's so much
dust right now this is disgusting so
yeah I don't know what else we could
talk about right now I think this is the
end of the vlog video thing trying to
get those thumbnails</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
