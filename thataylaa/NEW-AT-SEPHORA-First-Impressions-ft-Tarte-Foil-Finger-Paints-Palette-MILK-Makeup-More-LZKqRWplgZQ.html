I've never had in my life
all right so today I'm gonna be doing a
try on Hall style video first
impressions kind of thing using some
brand new products at Sephora I am super
excited because I'm actually partnering
with Sephora for this video what I've
been shopping at Sephora since I was 13
years old and once applying makeup with
those little sponge things so it's just
really cool to be able to work with them
so thank you to them and thank you to
you guys for watching I really
appreciate it I'm basically trying on
and doing a first impressions of five
brand new products at Sephora pickups
are back you can use the hashtag new at
Sephora to show off your own looks or to
check out other people's makeup or just
looking at it and it's actually a good
way to find kind of smaller artists and
just see new products and everything so
let's get into it I hope you guys had a
good holiday and spent it with people
that you love I personally watched way
too much vlog miss here we go all right
good morning guys I've got my coffee
classic thrift store mug here since I
mentioned this in a video a couple
months ago every time you guys see one
of these in the third story gets knows
about it so here we go I'm excited to
put the stuff on my face and try it out
so his first product I've actually been
trying out for about two weeks now
because obviously it's hard to do a
first impression on like a skincare
product so this is the Sunday Riley
auto-correct brightening and deep
puffing eye contour cream it says
instantly delivers a lifted and deep
puffed look while reducing the
appearance of dark circles and fine
lines so this has caffeine in it which
is supposed to help with the puffiness
and then the horse chestnut flower
extract on here is what's supposed to
help kind of firm and help out with the
wrinkles and I've been getting more
wrinkles down there let me tell you I
love the packaging of this I love this
silver it makes me excited to use it and
this does have a pump you need a really
tiny amount of this I usually just do
about that much and that's way enough so
this has a really cool kind of light
gold reflective thing to it which is why
I love using this in the morning it
gives you this super pretty kind of glow
under there that just brightens up your
under-eye and I like using this on days
when I don't wear makeup too it just
helps me look more awake because of that
kind of reflective thing in there it
feels really nice and moisturizing
doesn't feel like greasy or anything and
it's lightweight but it still feels like
it kind of sets down and gives you that
moisture I like to also kind of bring
this into
my inner corner a little bit just to
brighten it up and then I'll pull it
around kind of underneath my brow too
and this also has lutein in it lutein I
think that's I say it's supposed to huge
trick was to help with the blue light
exposure that you get from like your
screens and phones all right so next up
is a kind of cream highlighter product
my skin gets weird with putting any kind
of cream on top of products you guys
know I've talked about that in the past
any kind of cream product just doesn't
set the best for me on top of foundation
even if I haven't powdered yet if you
are gonna be using this or any kind of
cream product on top of a foundation
make sure that you haven't powdered your
face yet but I also just want to see
what this looks like on its own so this
is the milk makeup glitter stick has
mango butter coconut oil and avocado oil
so it's supposed to kind of like glide
on super easily supposed to give you
like a multi glitter kind of look and
you can kind of build it up from sheer
to more intense glitter so let's see
this thing has a little top on here I'm
going to take off so as you can use this
thing everywhere so you can use on your
cheeks lips eyes your body if you're
feeling it so I'm just gonna use my
finger I think and get a little swirl
going and then apply this with my finger
I first want to try it on my cheekbone
whoa they weren't kidding with the
glitter but it almost has this like
purple reflect to it there's some like
purple green blue so it's definitely
actually glitter in there this isn't
something that I would probably wear on
like a daily basis but I think if you're
doing some kind of fun look or if you
want to do body glitter or something
this would be really fun alright moving
into the product that I am so excited to
try because it sounds like it will be
right up my alley
this is the targa enforcer the C foil
finger paints shadow pellet look at this
packaging we all need to take a moment
of silence this is probably one the most
beautiful intricate palate designs I've
ever seen I mean look at this freaking
beating this takes me back to days of
like beating as a child did anyone else
do that or is that an only child thing
takes me back to my childhood and it's
called foil finger paints which makes me
really excited because you're actually
supposed to apply these with your finger
which is how I usually apply my lid
shadows you guys know I feel like you
get the best pigmentation that way too
so let's open this bad boy oh my gosh
I'm so excited to dip into these so in
here you get three warm tone foil
shadows and these are supposed to be
like liquefied metal kind of shadows and
this split pan thing right here these
are glitter top coats you can wear these
over eyeshadows or you can wear on your
own if you just want kind of more of a
subtle glitter that's like an oxymoron
begin you're a decent one and then this
really cool silver one that almost looks
like a gunmetal kind of silver I just
want to put all these on my eyes right
now so I don't know what I'm gonna do
with this I'm gonna swatch some of these
I haven't dipped my fingers in here at
all yet so let's do gold coast this
feels so soft definitely feels like oh
my god super pretty look at that reflect
that's gold coast let's do sailor's
delight which is this like cranberry red
shade there is sailor's delight that
would definitely go well with I just put
on some matte shadows as like a base to
get going since all these are foiled I
might put that on the lower lash line
let's try see glass also brings me back
to my childhood because my mom and I
used to collect beach glass whoa hold up
hold up we might need to do this one
heck yeah look at that it almost has
like a blue Brown kind of reflect to it
hey let's try out these glitter top
coats I know if it's just because I
accidentally just wash it with the red
underneath there but look at that color
on top of red that was the iridescent
one so I'm assuming that kind of changes
depending on what you put underneath it
but with that red whoa I just got this
like coppery kind of thing I want to
swatch it with a clean finger to see
what it looks like on its own on this
own it looks like kind of a lighter gold
ish greenish okay I got to use this
alright I feel very torn right now I'm
literally strategizing how I can try and
put all these on my eyes right now
because I just want to play with all of
them that silver glitter is really
speaking to me but I have like gold
going on and then this kind of warm look
so I think I'm gonna save that silver
one for a shadow and schmooze or
something so I think I'm gonna start out
with seaglass these feel literally like
butter have that wet metallic kind of
feel so I'm just gonna put this right on
the lid that is beautiful
you definitely don't need to wet a brush
or anything with these just use your
finger because look at that pigment I
think I'm kind of the inner corner just
first part of my eye right there I'm
gonna use a bold Coast
these are definitely buildable like you
can kind of layer these and get even
crazier pigment I'm just kind of
blending this into the other shade with
my finger so I'm gonna put some on the
brush and I'm gonna wet this just for
right under here so I can get a little
bit more of a pop using the brush so for
the lower lash line I'm gonna take
sailor's delight this cranberry metallic
shade and I'm just using a liner brush
and I'm just gonna line the lower lash
line I think I'm also gonna use that to
kind of line the top a little bit if you
have green eyes any kind of red or
purple dependents Mason pot alright so
just popped on some lashes and some
lower lash line mascara these are still
drying let's go in for lipsticks to have
two lipsticks here buy this for
collection these are their lip stories
lipsticks this lighter nude shade is the
shade tan lines that is something I've
never had in my life ooh that looks
pretty I haven't swatches or anything
yet
don't have a scent at all it looks like
this is a cream I like how it says it
right on here it's like imprinted into
the lipstick and then this deeper shade
is called wanderlust
this is a matte it's like a really deep
purpley has a little bit of brown in
there it looks like so for just launches
collection and there are 40 shades in
here and these retail for $8 so very
good price point on these there are
trendier colors some italics Matt
screams metallics die say metallics
decide metallics I'm kind of feeling the
nude one today just because I have this
like black lace going on the packaging
on here is cool it's different it looks
like road-tripped theme or something
oh it has a nice like glossy look at
that feels super moisturizing which is
what I need right now because my lips
are like peeling feels super comfortable
on the lips and I like that shade it's a
winner
all right so this next thing is a
perfume you guys know I'm a perfume
hoarder I think
like 35 perfumes literally they're all
up there the Stella McCartney peony
perfume super cute like what's called
raised this is actually really soothing
that's like raised bumps on here and
when I first heard peony I didn't think
I was gonna be into it because I'm not
that into like floral kind of sense but
like I said I've used this a few times
now and I actually really like it and it
doesn't smell anything like I thought it
was gonna smell and as soon as I looked
at the notes I knew exactly why I liked
this the notes in here are peony rose
pepper and amber and I am all about any
scent that has amber in it I'm really
into like musky amber II kind of sense
and this smells amazing go into a
Sephora and smell this I'm gonna spray
it on right now Oh smells so good it
smells fresh it has that like flowery
fresh scent but then it's still super
musky and like sexy and it could
definitely be like a daytime or
nighttime kind of perfume and I guess
this perfume was kind of a
reinterpretation of when there passed
perfumes called Stella - from back in
2006 and so this is there like
reinterpretation of it and they made it
kind of more spicy and modern and I
definitely smelled the spice this bottle
is also just very gorgeous like if you
sat this on your shelf I'll probably sit
it back there actually I'm just really
pleasantly surprised by this so that's
everything those are kind of my first
impressions and thoughts on some new
products that's for right now hope you
guys like this video if you did don't
forget to give it a thumbs up I'm
actually shocked by the way that this
lipstick has not transferred onto my
teeth this whole time I've been talking
