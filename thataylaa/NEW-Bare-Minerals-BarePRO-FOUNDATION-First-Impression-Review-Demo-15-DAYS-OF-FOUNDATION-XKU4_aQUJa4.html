cup today I swear they're everywhere
all right so today it is day 4 of 15
days of foundation days one through
three I link down below in the
description box in a playlist I dyed my
roots last night and so it looks like I
have a wig on right now today we're
trying out the brand new bare minerals
bare Pro performance wear a liquid
foundation quite the name here's what
the box looks like I have two shades
here fair zero one and Dawn zero two
I know the first few foundations have
been high-end I do have a bunch of
drugstore foundations come in I placed a
huge ole to order and it just hasn't
come in yet so it's Foundation retails
for $34 on before you get one fluid
ounce of product which is standard 34
bucks it's kind of mid-range for
high-end kind of in-between Clinique for
the most part and like YSL which we
tested out yesterday so this has SPF 20
in it it says it's a skin loving 24 hour
breathable full coverage natural matte
liquid foundation does it blurs pores
and imperfections while providing a soft
focused natural matte finish with up to
24 hour wear it works in plays as hard
as you do and I quote that's pretty much
it says it's good for all skin types I
have combination oily skin I do get oily
throughout the day it comes in a
ton of shades which is very exciting
comes in 30 shades
I'm insert swatches right here so you
can see how the lightest two shades
compared to some of the other foundation
shades I have right here is the bare
minerals foundation and fair zero 1 next
to it is dawn 0-2 as you can see there's
a huge difference between the first two
shade next over is derm called 2:08 pur
cosmetics paradol foundation Urban Decay
Naked skin and 0.5 and Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless in 110 mention it in
the end of day 3 video but just in case
you didn't stick around till the end
since there isn't any kind of
involvement with Project Beauty share
this time around since we're working on
something for the next series that's
really big if you want to continue to
support them you can definitely donate
through their website I only blink for
it down below along with what project
Beauty sure is and more information on
them I just want to throw it out there
even though there's no t-shirts or ebay
or anything you can definitely still
donate to them and support them so if
you're excited for day 4 of 15 minutes
of foundation don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up alright let's jump
into it if you want to see my thoughts
on the bare minerals bare Pro Foundation
you're in the right place just keep
watching
whew definitely just started filming
without my gun that would have been
great so it's 7:20 for in the morning
get started filming super early today
because I have a sh
do leave for LA early tomorrow morning I
haven't even primed my face what am i
doing
they've washed moisturize and primed my
face we're gonna do a sponge on one half
of my face like usual and a brush on the
other this is the elf ultimate blending
brush so I haven't swatch these I'm
going to start out with this shade fair
one and see how that one goes
I am so excited to try this Mallory sent
me come oh geez at 7:30 in the morning
I clearly described a friendship it's
going on the brush side see how this
does well that is a little light it
might be a mixture of these two but let
me first just trout dawn I'm gonna add
in a tiny bit of John on the palette
dawn looks too dark but we'll see yeah
it's very yellow it doesn't blend out
super easily like it has a little bit of
a gel feel to it almost on this cheek I
have like 98% of the fair shade I just
add a tiny bit of dawn so I'm gonna just
try dawn on this side of my forehead so
you can see the difference Don I think
is closer it's a bit too yellow for my
skin tone especially right now because
my chest is a little sunburned okay
getting high medium coverage maybe even
low full coverage on this side with a
brush let's go and with just dawn much
lighter coverage with the sponge for
sure and that just soaked up all the
product this looks like highlight
coverage with the sponge on the side
thinking brush is the way to go with
this one and then I might try blending
it out with a sponge afterwards just to
get a smooth finish wait what am i doing
he's gonna go and brush it's not looking
great on my forehead with a brush I'm
going to smooth it out with that sponge
in a second but first I'm gonna go back
over this with a brush
yeah the coverage with a brush is like a
different world compared to with a
sponge
I don't know dawn is now looking too
dark always hard to tell on camera but
in real life dawn looks too dark I
actually think I'm closer to the shade
now that it's like settled onto my skin
a little bit I definitely like the
undertone a fair better it's a little
bit more pink just try and smooth this
out because my forehead is looking a bit
textured slash the rest of my face is
too going over it with this sponge is
definitely helping some of the texture
that I got with the brush still looks a
little bit heavy so I'm at about full
coverage right now it kind of just looks
makeup B to me my forehead looks pretty
heavy
I also around my nose area
upper lip it looks a little bit cakey it
was a bit tacky it hasn't totally sat
down yet I think I could blend product
on top of here without setting it right
now at 7:37 I'm gonna do the rest eye
makeup decide if I want to set this with
the powder and I'll be right back
all right so it's now 8 o'clock so this
is when we're calling the check-in time
I just did a very basic makeup today
because I have a ton of errands to
run
I ended up setting my face with the same
powder I used yesterday laura geller
balance and brighten powder it did help
to make my skin look a little bit more
skin like and less cakey but it still
looks pretty dang heavy I was trying to
think of what foundation this reminds me
of and it looks exactly on my skin like
the Estee Lauder Double Wear does I have
a flaw other review on that product but
that is not my favorite foundation at
all you know some people love that
foundation but on my skin it just cakes
up and looks so dang heavy and that's
exactly how this foundation is looking
on my skin right now settling into every
possible wrinkle on my forehead the
center of my forehead doesn't look good
it looks very textured I tried to show
you guys on the other camera what it
looks like up close so early right now
that the light isn't super great it was
hard to kind of capture what it actually
looks like just overall looks very
makeup B and very heavy right now one
adjective I would just say heavy cakey -
adjectives on my skin right now I'm not
liking how it looks but we'll see how it
wears throughout the day on the rest of
my face again I use the bare minerals
contour as a bronzer shade trying to
figure out a bronzer to bring with me to
LA and I think I might just bring this
one because I do really like the shade
of this or a highlighter use Physicians
Formula and natural nude and you're
having a makeup day this product is
bomb and I also put that on my lids as
eyeshadow for blush I used a tiny bit of
flower Beauty Primrose peach Primrose
this is very very peachy almost to the
point where it looks a little bit orange
on my skin and then I use Milani matte
naked on the lips topped it off with
gosh 0:01
match which is like this late nudie
color I'll see you guys in a few hours
in the next check-in hopefully we will
have more light ok so right now it's
1258 almost 1 o'clock that's been on for
5 hours so I've been out running errands
and stuff I did look in the car mirror
and in the bathroom mirror of where I
was creasing quite a bit around my nose
area upper lip and just around my mouth
in general my forehead looks pretty good
it just still looks a bit heavy to me
okay so I think you guys can see that
there's a huge crease right here and on
this side too around my nose right here
it's creasing upper lip right here it's
creasing it looks like I'm starting to
get a bit oily but nothing bad at this
point my forehead I think actually looks
slightly better since I first put it on
since my oil is kind of coming through I
just feel like I kind of look and feel
like I have a mask on right now but I'll
see you guys at the end of the night
right now it is 8:28 so it's been on for
a camera
the check-in time was 8 o'clock or 8:30
see they've been on for 12 hours or 12
and a half hour so there's a long
check-in so as you can see my face is a
complete different shape than my neck so
that was fun all day I don't why my eyes
are so red right now ignore that clearly
not looking too great separate it all
over here it still looks heavy and then
this just you can see everything you can
see the makeup on my face just overall
does not look good I think the only way
I would wear this one is I'm gonna try
mixing it in and without their
foundation see if that helps this one on
its own for me a hundred percent reminds
me of that Estee Lauder Double Wear so
if you like Estee Lauder no more you
might like this one if it works
differently on you both you just look
very heavy very kinky feel like I've
said the same words 5,000 times at this
point I think you get it I'm waking up
at 4 a.m. for a flight so I have to get
my together right now I'm hoping by
the time I come back from LA the Oulton
package will be here and I'll be able to
do a drugstore foundation so if you guys
are enjoying 15 days foundation don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up
love you guys thanks for watching see
you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
