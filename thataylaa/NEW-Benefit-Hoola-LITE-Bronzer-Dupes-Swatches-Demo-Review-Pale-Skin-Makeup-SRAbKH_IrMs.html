cardboard box
all right so today we're going to be
talking about a very exciting new
release from benefit this is the benefit
hoola light bronzer the benefit hoola
bronzer has been like cult favorite for
years this is a lot of people's Holy
Grail bronzer this product has never
worked on my skintone it's just been
much too dark and it just looks like way
too much orange intense the one I saw
thanks to you guys who tagged me on
Instagram five thousand times when you
saw this coming out so when I saw that
they came out with a lighter shade had a
moment so in this video I'm gonna show
you how it applies on my face actually
found a couple very affordable dupe
options and I'm also going to be
swatching it compared to some other
popular bronzers and just telling you my
thoughts if I think this is worth it so
if you're excited for this video make
sure you give it a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the bay radio
family and subscribe I upload Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time
today I'm actually filming two videos
I'm filming a foundation Friday video as
well so if you want to see the rest of
my face makeup and everything that will
be in Friday's video let's jump in I'm
gonna start out with reading some of the
claims and price and all that from
ulties website so this product retails
for $29 and you get zero point two eight
ounces of product it's actually a bit
less than most other bronzers I have
right here at least so in the Physicians
Formula butter bronzer you get 0.38
ounces of product in the Too Faced milk
chocolate Soleil bronzer you get 0.35
and then the body shop bronzer which is
one of my favorites you get 0.39 ounces
of product subrata so the claims are
minimal but it just says perfect for
fair complexions or for youth doesn't
all over finishing powders so even if
you do have a little bit darker of a
complexion than I do you could use this
as an all-over powder it says instantly
warms your complexion leaving you with a
healthy believable glow blend smoothly
and seamlessly and we do get a brush
with both the benefit hoola light and a
normal one so as far as packaging I feel
like I'm kind of on an island here but
other than that I don't think that's an
analogy it might be the minority here
but I actually don't like the packaging
of the benefit hoola bronzer for 29
bucks I think it's pretty cheap this is
a cardboard box and the other thing that
bothers me about this is that when I
open and close it it kind of gets caught
on the ledge here so you kind of have to
pry it open a little bit and then push
it down that might just be my box maybe
I got a little bit of a defective one
because this one closes a lot easier it
does have a magnet to it'll close shut
so you don't have to worry
the box coming open or anything so I'm
going to go into the application so you
can see me actually putting this on and
how it looks on my skin how it blends
out all that so the shader this is kind
of interesting it almost to me looks
like a dark face powder it's not super
warm it's not super cool I would say
this is very neutral it almost has like
a tan kind of look to it so let's go to
the application and then I'm going to
show you guys swatches of the two dupes
that I found and also compare them to
other bronzers so on either side of my
face I'm use different brushes and once
I'm going to use my wet and wild contour
brush or whatever this is called angled
brush and then my Sigma F 15 on the
other this is a duo fiber brush and it
applies bronzer really nicely and it
gives like an airbrush look to it I've
been using this a lot lately so I do
have powder on top of my foundation
right now which helps to kind of blend
out any products that you put on top of
it so we should be good to go as far as
not having the product stick or anything
like that so I'm just going to go in
blending out really nicely it's kind of
just adding a bit more warmth to my face
without looking orange E or red or
anything like that
I actually prefer my bronzers to have
more of a red tone to them I like the
way that that brush just applied it so
let's try to do a fiber brush on the
other side and see if there's a
difference like I'm getting much lighter
color payoff on this side I'm going with
a bit more product yeah I think I
definitely like how it applies with the
wet and wild brush better but let's try
this temples I typically only bring up
my bronzer to my temples if I need to
warm up my face like if my foundation is
looking a bit light or if it's a really
light bronzer like this is I think it
blends out really easily I like how you
don't have to really work a whole lot
alright so we are back the rest of my
makeup is on if you want to know what I
used on the rest of my face everything
is listed down below in the description
box along with my t-shirt watch jewelry
everything movies watching both of these
next to each other and then telling you
guys my two affordable dupes that I
found and then the rest of the bronzers
just so you can kind of see shaped
comparisons but I can't hold my mic at
the same time as doing this so hopefully
it sounds ok so this first watch is the
hoola light on the left hand side
compared to the normal hoola bronzer
here's what they look like
side-by-side in the packaging next watch
over right here is the Maybelline fit me
powder this is actually a face powder to
shade 310 I think this is the closest
drugstore alternative to this that I
found it technically is the face powder
you can use it as bronzer here's been
side by side in the pan so in other
products which is pretty dang close is
this palette this shade right here from
the beauty treats contour palette you
can get this from I Kate house is super
affordable I also did try the shade
below it which looks pretty close as
well end up watching both shades in that
palette I just talked about this is a
lighter one this is one that's a tiny
bit darker I think if you go with
interviews I even mixed the two or just
go with whichever one you think is good
I mean if you're going to have to
palette you have both options so now I'm
just going to swatch a few other
bronzers these aren't doopsy they're
just so you can see shade comparisons
between this and the hoola light bronzer
so let's start off with the Physicians
Formula City glow bronzer this is in the
shade Paris
I usually either mix these two shades or
just go in with this top one depending
on what I'm feeling but definitely we're
just going to swatch this top shade
right here so this one is a bit warmer
and it does have a little bit of a glow
to it this one isn't quite as matte as
the other products next we're going to
do the Physicians Formula butter bronzer
in the light shade so again here it's
this little light this one is actually
pretty close when I apply this one to my
face it pulls very orange versus the
hillo light bronzer which on my skin
doesn't pull as orange next up is the
body shop runs in the shade 0-1 light
and this used to be one of my favorite
bronzers I haven't used this in a while
here it is right here it's definitely a
bit more red toned which is probably why
I like it that's usually what I'm drawn
to and then last watch I'm going to do
is the Too Faced milk chocolate Soleil
bronzer this is personally not one that
I reach for a whole lot but I know this
was a lot of people's favorite so I
wanted to watch this one
it's a two-faced milk chocolate Soleil
bronzer right now alright so those are
all the swatches do I think this is
worth it for 29 bucks I think that the
formula this is really nice blend out
very effortlessly if you like the whole
vibe of this packaging and you just kind
of want to splurge on a high-end product
I do think so this is really nice for
more fair complexions
I think this could work for one shade
darker skin tones than I am if you're
any more than that this would probably
be more of a face powder for you every
bronzer pulls differently depending on
your undertone and everything for
example I know a lot of people love the
Physicians Formula
or bronzer for me this one just look
straight up orange on my skin for
whatever reason so if any of these
products you'll probably just have to
try it out for yourself and see how it
looks on your skin tone since both of
these are super affordable and they're
pretty dang close to the hoola light
bronzer if you wanted to save twenty
bucks I think you could definitely get
away with these and the bonus to getting
this one is that you obviously get ten
shades in here I've actually used these
four eyeshadows and they work totally
fine for eyeshadows but what I use this
again absolutely I like how it looks I
think it looks like a really natural
kind of bronze it doesn't look like too
much so if you're a similar skin tone to
me and that's what you're going for you
might like this guy so I hope this video
is helpful for you if it was make sure
you give it a thumbs up love you guys
thanks for watching see my next video
