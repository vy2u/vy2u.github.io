I'm oddly attracted to it alright so
today it is foundation Friday happy
found happy foundation Friday if you're
new here this is what I do a new first
impression video every single Friday on
my channel i'ma leave a link to the
playlist down below if you want to go
ahead and watch any other foundation
Friday videos so one of my favorite
foundations is the Clinique beyond
perfecting foundation and concealer of a
full Rio and I never use that a lot in
recent videos testing out with different
primers and stuff so I was excited to
see that Clinique came out with a new
foundation product this is their biy
blend it yourself pigment drops so as
you can see this bottle is frickin tiny
when I got this in the mail I thought
Ulta threw in a free like deluxe
travel-size saying Clinique I think you
win the award for the smallest
foundation bottle so the idea of these
drops are kind of similar to the cover
FX custom cover drops or the hard candy
pigment drops which I also have a review
on not a fan of the hard candy ones the
cover FX drops I do love their one of my
favorite foundation products I don't
talk a whole lot about them for some
reason I should probably just do
dedicated review on that because I don't
think I actually have a dedicated video
on that product but the idea is that
these are pigment drops so you can mix
them in with a moisturizer a primer you
can add coverage to other foundations by
just mixing in a few drops I personally
love using my cover FX drops to add to
other foundations to give them more
coverage let's go ahead and read some of
the claims about this product on Ulta
you get 0.3 4 ounces of product and it
retails for $33 the cover FX custom
cover drops you get zero point 5 ounces
of product in those retail for $44 so
you do get a bit more product in those
but they're also a bit more expensive
these only come in 12 shades I have the
lightest shade biy 105 I'm in the shade
and 10 for reference in the cover FX
drops I am gonna insert swatches of
these drops compared to some of the
other foundations that I have alright so
swatch time I unfortunately don't have
the cover effect drops to swatch here
thought I had them in my room but I'm
pretty sure they're back in the office
so once I'm able to go to the office and
grab those I'll do a swatch comparison
of that with the biy drops on snapchat
so right here is the Clinique viy drops
in the lightest shade next over is the
pur cosmetics bear doll foundation
and the lighter shade porcelain urban
decay naked skin foundation and 0.5
derma call to 0-8 and then last is
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless in
110 the lightest shade
I'm really hoping they're going to
expand the line because for being
pigment drops and kind of mixing
products isn't super great
Clinique shade range kind of drives me
crazy their numbering and everything is
always really weird so I did order these
online but I feel like the best way if
you want to get shade match is to go
into the actual counter because you
really never know what you're getting
with cleaning shades so reading some of
the claims that says transform your
favorite moisturizer into a BB CC or
fuller coverage foundation one drop
create sheer coverage two or three a
flawless finish
since clinic DIY takes on the finish of
the moisturizer you blend it with expect
a more matte finish with a mattifying
moisturizer or more dewy radiant finish
when blended with a moisturizer that
contains optics so they're kind of whole
thing with this is mixing it in with a
moisturizer you guys will see during the
demo but I did do half my face with
moisturizer and the other half mixing in
with foundation just so you can see how
what makes it sound Asian if there's a
difference in coverage and how it
applies and all that kind of stuff so I
have combination skin with cystic acne I
get pretty oily throughout the day on my
t-zone I'm sitting so awkwardly right
now what am i doing does all the claims
on this guy if you're excited for
foundation Friday make sure you give
this video a thumbs up if you want to
see my thoughts on the Clinique DIY
drops and how they apply and more
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching all right so it
has been an interesting morning it is
10:30 right now I've been up since 6:00
so I'm going to start filming super
early in that gun yes I was going to
start filming super early and then
totally got sidetracked redesigning my
entire blog so now we are here I want to
start posting more outfit travel kind of
photo based posts on my blog if not
calling there it's just the telecom but
anyways let's talk about this
I have fairly small hands and look at
how tiny this thing is so I'm going to
shake this quote some very like okay so
trying to think about the best way to
try out this thing because you can mix
it with moisturizer you can make it with
primer or you can mix it with a
foundation to get more coverage the way
that I like to use the cover FX custom
cover drops is by mixing them in with
foundation I love doing that too more
sheer medium coverage foundations and
getting full coverage out of it and if
it's a good shade match which my custom
cover drops are it can help
neutralized the foundation or lighten it
in some cases for the sake of this
review and trying out this product I
think what I'm first going to do is mix
it on half of my face in with a
moisturizer just to see how much
coverage we can get that way and then
either on the other side or kind of on
the entire face as a second layer I
might try mixing it in with my Tarte
reinforce of the C's foundation slobs
done right now is watching my skin I
have not moisturize yet I'm going to go
in with the Kim Chi over Wanderlust
moisturizer I'm using this moisturizer
over the past couple weeks you supposed
to be able to use this to kind of prime
your face as well so no idea how much
I'm going to need of this but let's
start with about a dime-size amount I
don't think that's going to be a whole
lot so I usually need way more product
than that so it says one drop for sheer
coverage two drops for medium coverage
three drops for fuller coverage so I'm
going in with three drops below okay so
that drops out really quickly it's super
liquidy let's do two three whoops okay
that was like four it literally just
kind of pours out I'm not even squeezing
the bottle so I'm going to go ahead and
mix this in okay this is about four
drops mixed in with a dime size amount
of moisturizer so let's go in on this
side and see how well this thing covers
this is supposed to be doesn't say full
coverage just as fuller coverage and
keep in mind when they say three drops
I'm assuming that means full coverage
for the entire face the amount of drops
they say is probably relative to the
amount that you're mixing in with
moisturizer and everything if you have
more moisturizer it will probably dilute
the product more smells just kind of
like sunscreen so with the amount that I
put out I just used all that on half of
my face not full coverage even on half
my face I say we got about medium
coverage can see my freckle is scarring
everything coming through it basically
just evened out my redness a bit
if this oxidizes is going to be too dark
it's hard to tell the mists lighting but
it's a tiny bit dark nothing horrible
though the finish and everything with
the moisturizer looks nice I think what
I'm going to do is actually put that
same amount in the four drops with the
Tarte reinforce of the C foundation on
this side and see what kind of coverage
we get I do want to see how both sides
kind of fold up throughout the day so
you don't think I'm going to put the
foundation all over my face the Tarte
one let's shake this guy if you're new
here this is one of my favorite
foundations I tried this out in one of
the first 15 days of foundation and I
loved it they just reach
we came out with this shade which is
porcelain this one matches me a lot
better than fair neutral this one's a
little bit too yellow tone for me but it
can work so I have a dime-sized amount
of the tar game for to see let's do one
two three four
hopefully the color and the thing about
that hopefully the color match is OK on
both sides I might be walking around
with two different shades on my face
today
so the targeting force of the sea
foundation on its own is about medium
coverage I usually use two layers and
build it up to full coverage so if I can
make something in that gives us full
coverage off the bat Julia I just
realized I didn't more stir eyes this
half of my face whoops
okay so this side with the foundation
I'm getting really good coverage it
almost looks like it's mattifying
foundation attorney of it I feel like
I'm using way less product than I
normally do with the reinforcements see
I normally go in with two pretty
generous layers to get the kind of
coverage I like and there's still
product left over from that amount we
got full coverage on this side this is
covering everything this I definitely
looks like much lighter coverage which
is expected if I mixing it in with a
moisturizer that has zero pigment versus
the foundation that obviously has color
to it so I don't need a second layer on
this side which I love and I still have
products left over over here just to
cover my acne down here on my neck I'm
going to use this just a lot wasting
product I still want to see how this
side builds up with the moisturizer on a
second layer so let's go ahead and do
that I'm going to do the same exact
amount that I did on the first layer it
seems to be mixing totally fine with
both products and not getting any weird
separation or anything okay sweet we got
much better coverage on a second layer
this is building to full coverage now
with the moisturizer so on the center of
my forehead I kind of have mixed both I
think like the Tarte and II moisturizer
this side is looking a little bit more
textured around my nose area it's kind
of emphasizing my pores a bit more I
definitely liked the look of this side
better on my forehead this looks a
little bit more smooth this one you can
just see the product a bit more I think
it's safe to say two layers with the
moisturizer is about the same as mixing
with one layer in the foundation keep in
mind I've used
the amount of drops now on this side I
would say have about 810 drops just on
this half of my face and on this side I
have the four four or five drops so if
you're wanting full coverage it probably
makes more sense to just mix in with
foundation the clothing about pigment
drops is that you can totally customize
them so if you're going to the beach
here at summer or whatever and you just
want more sheer coverage you can even
mix this in with the foundation a
foundation a sunscreen all right so up
close here's what my skin is looking
like I think it looks nice on both sides
I don't know if it's going to totally
show up for you guys but there is just a
tiny bit more texture on this side if
you like it's just a little bit heavier
around my nose area right here but on
the second layer you can see that it
covered my acne and stuff pretty well
over here so it's 10:43 right now I'm
going to do the rest on makeup I'm not
sure if I'm going to set everything with
a powder I typically do with the Tarte
reinforces the C foundations I'm
probably I'm going to set my entire face
so I'm gonna do the rest my makeup and I
will be right back okay so it's now
11:20 we're going to call the check-in
time 11 o'clock that's when I finished
out my face and everything these
eyelashes are going to be off in about
five seconds after I've finished filming
mist eyeballs are on fire so I would
tell you guys everything that's on the
rest of my face in a second but let's
talk about how everything is looking so
I did set my face with my celebration
foundation illumination in the shade
fair so I kept his knees amazing when
you just put on false lashes is the
worst okay I think we're good
so after putting on the powder I
definitely like how this side of my face
looks better like I've been saying this
I just looks a bit more textured did you
see the moisturizer I mixed it with you
could also try mixing in with the primer
but other than that I love the fact that
I could use only one layer to get full
coverage with my Tarte rainforest in the
seat you know the DIY drops look dark I
think I actually do well with the orange
e undertone because that's the way that
the Pierre cosmetics paradol foundation
looks swatched and everything but when
it's actually on my face the tone looks
right to me so on the rest of my face
everything that I talked about is always
listed down below in the description box
I use this shade right here from the LA
Colors contour palette I mentioned this
in my favorite contour products for pale
skin video and I did feel like this side
actually blended out a lot easier than
this one I really had to work to get
this one blended and I feel like it
still looks a tiny bit not patchy it was
just more difficult to get like an even
blend blushes butter blush and natural
glow
I feel like I've used this five thousand
times but I'm just in love with these I
highlight today's and reaching for a lot
lately again this is the elf
illuminating palette love this white
shade right here fit pan and I went in
with Shannon College the Shia XO BH
Cosmetics eyeshadow palette I used these
three lists I just used these two shades
on the lid and then this one on lower
lash line these lashes I'm in love with
mostly the packaging these are the
Blackmagic lashes I showed you on
snapchat doing an unboxing but look at
this packaging and then on the inside
you get a little quote in each one and
they open up look at this I love this
packaging I'm wearing the style fortune
I believe I have a discount code for you
guys on this if I do I'll put it down
below in the description box and lips
I'm really curious to see how this wears
throughout the day because so far I'm
really liking this this is the makeup
revolution retro luxe matte lip kit you
get a lip pencil and the liquid lipstick
these are basically like Kylie lip kit
dupes
this is in the shade Noble and both the
lip liner and the liquid lipstick went
on super smooth moisturizing really nice
formula hoping it totally drives down
because this one is feeling a little
tiny bit sticky which I don't really
like like I said we're going to call the
check-in time 11 o'clock the next check
and I do will be in natural lighting I
desperately need to eat something right
now my stomach sounds like it's going to
eat itself okay so it's now 5 o'clock so
it's actually been on for 6 hours this
is the long break in between check-ins
but I was just in the zone working
eyelashes already off my eyes are like
on fire so I never wear falsies when I
film first impressions feel like I just
need to rub off all of my eye makeup
right now so I think this side overall
it looks like it's holding up a tiny bit
better the main area that I noticed a
difference is on my forehead it looks a
bit more matte than this side and also
around my nose so as you can see on this
side it looks a bit caked up around here
and definitely looks heavier than this
side so this side still looks pretty
smooth I mean six hours in this is
pretty typical for me yeah it's just
kind of separating around my nose area
my forehead doesn't want too different I
just think it looks overall a tiny bit
less oily on my forehead on this side
but so far so good I've been eating a
lot today and PMSing
let's take it's holding up pretty well
considering I've eaten some oily foods
you can still feel the stickiness so
it's not one of the lipsticks that
totally dries down I'm going to try and
check in around 9 p.m. we're having
someone over for dinner tonight and then
the bachelors on ok so it's now 1103 so
everything has been on for exactly 12
hours I've had a little bit of a rough
night with the internet so I'm just
ready to wash this off and go to bed to
be honest so this has been on for a full
12 hours and it's not looking too great
on either side right now it looks great
overall I think it looks better on the
tart side still but both sides are super
oily my forehead looks like bad like
looks like you could dig something into
it my skin just looks pretty heavy right
now I'd say but that could just be since
it's been on for 12 hours I like how it
mixed in with other foundations for me I
don't think I would mix it in with
moisturizer but I am going to try it
with other foundations so I'll keep you
guys updated and I'm going to start the
check in right here alright so this is
my future self coming back at you about
week and a half later I just got back
from London which you guys will hear all
about I'm actually filming a different
first impression video today I thought I
was going to have time to try out the
foundation a couple more times and kind
of give my overall thoughts if I need to
upload this foundation Friday tomorrow
so I don't have any other thoughts from
after filming this the first time when I
am able to try out the viy drops again
I'm going to update you guys in the
description box and I'll also update you
on snapchat but with London and pre
recording and recording for this next
week that I'm also going to be offline
it's just been a little bit hectic so I
hope you guys can understand but just
kind of to give you an overall
conclusion on what I think about the DIY
drops for me personally I don't think I
would mix it in with a moisturizer or
primer I do like the way that it added
coverage to my Tarte rainforest to the C
foundation you guys saw it didn't look
great at the end of the day so I'm not
sure if it's just the combination mixed
with rainforest of the sea or if it's
the actual drop since it did look pretty
bad on the moisturizer side as well
12-hour check-in is very long I usually
do 10 hour check-ins
so I would say these drops are more on
the matte side so if you don't like the
illuminating effect that the cover FX
drops gives you might like these ones
better since they are a bit more matte I
do think they add nice coverage as far
as the consistency I would say these are
almost up there with the cover effects
ones obviously I haven't tried them out
nearly as much as the cover effects one
and I do like the smoothing kind of
illuminating finish at the cover of
excellence have these are definitely
more matte and I feel like I saw a bit
more texture but the coverage was there
for me so I'm going to continue to play
around with these I don't think they're
like 5 out of 5 stars for me yet but I
don't think they're horrible
so I hope you guys liked this video if
you found it helpful make sure you give
it a thumbs up so I know if you're new
here you can join the burrito family and
subscribe I upload Monday Wednesday
Friday foundation Friday on Friday
clearly love you guys thanks for
