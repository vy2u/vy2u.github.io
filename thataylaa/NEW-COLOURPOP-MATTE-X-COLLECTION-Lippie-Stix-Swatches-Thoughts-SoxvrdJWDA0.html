filming setup
well my room sounds different without
sounds a lot more like hollow in here so
if you follow me on snapchat I basically
rearranged my entire room the weekend my
parents came and this is the first video
I'm filming with the new setup the
background is gonna be changing I just
have a different lens on right now so I
have to be like super far away from the
camera literally I used to have about
two feet in front of me to film and now
I have an entire open space it is great
I feel like I have room finally let me
know what you guys think of this
lighting and situation the background
will likely be changing but since we're
doing swatches I wanted to put on my
good lens so you guys can see the
swatches from far away so my parents
just left we did some shopping downtown
Seattle and I came home to these bad
boys I post on Instagram about the brand
new color pop Matt X collection and a
bunch of you guys ask first watches
videos so that's all we're going to be
doing today okay first of all this
packaging just first of all this
packaging just speaks to me I feel like
colour-pop understands my life all of
the lippie stix came in this super cute
black matte slide out thing then it also
came with this little card so there's no
information on when he's actually
release colour-pop usually post on their
Instagram when I'm filming this they're
not available to buy it yet by 10:00
this video is up it probably will be
check the info box down below because
that's where I list everything always
supposed to be high intensity full
coverage pigment with one sharp
application long wearing velvety glide
without uncomfortable dragging or
pulling supposed to have a super matte
finish even there lippie stix that claim
that they're matte aren't actually very
mad so I'm thinking that's why this
collection came in says that it contains
a super special silky powder that gives
the lipstick a lightweight feel
flexibility and prevents drying out this
is the most matte formula of all their
lifts lippie stix
and just like everything else it has no
parabens contains vitamin E you Shea and
all
better so I've worn two colors so far or
need one this morning and I just put on
this one and the nude one lasted pretty
well throughout eating it did completely
wear off in the center of my lips I have
super dry lips right now and it didn't
emphasize the dryness anymore I felt
super comfortable on the lips and this
collection also came with a primer I've
never seen the color pop primer before
so I'm not sure if this is new as well
it's like a clear primer that you put on
before and this kind of weirdly
mattifies your lips but it also feels
like a lip balm so I did apply that both
times before wearing these so in this
video we're basically just gonna be
hands watching all these I'm not gonna
do a lip swatch video because my lips
are already dying
I don't know Westmont going on but
they're like bleeding and peeling off
and cracking and I can't fix it so I
don't know if you have any tips let me
know alright so I went ahead and swatch
the first seven shades so you guys can
see I'm just gonna read off the names in
order the first one we have here is
poppin this is like a matte magenta
shade this next one is booty I
personally love this I think this color
and this color are gonna look amazing as
like a springy kind of red lip this
tangerine shade right here is called
topless this one looks like borderline
to orange for me if you have a tan go
and that might look good this is like a
straight-up neon orange color this shade
is trust me which looks like it's a
pretty pinky tone red right here we have
the shade barely-there which is like a
neon coral with a little bit of pink in
it this rusty orange red shade is called
love life and I am feeling this one I'm
excited to wear that it lasts super
fuchsia bright-pink one is tickler this
is a straight-up neon fuchsia pink and I
feel like it's not even showing up as
neon as it actually is okay now moving
on to this bottom row first we have boa
super pretty lilac color then we have
cami which is the one I'm wearing on my
lips right now I love this second one
right here this is like a perfect 90s
kind of nude then we have backup I'm
gonna play around and do a look with
that third color right there then we
have this purpley blue e whatever this
is color reminds me of like Shamu or
some
and that is the shade climaxed I would
that is not what I would call that color
then we have this really nice dark red
plum color and this is Chateau it kind
of looks like Mac diva to me over here
this brown shade is Hollywood Boulevard
actually try this on my lips last night
and if you have pale skin it looks a
little bit too Brown in my opinion it
looks kind of like poop this next one
that was really pretty this is the shade
pillow-talk cool milk chocolate color
then this last one right here is she bad
and this is probably my favorite this is
a great nude color this is the one I
wore this morning it doesn't have too
much peach in it so those are all the
shades that I have I think these are
totally worth giving a try they're only
$5 colour-pop is super affordable and
really great quality for the price as
far as being completely mapped most of
them look pretty dang math there's a
couple shades that have a tiny bit of
sheen to it but for the most part I
think this is definitely their mattes
collection I agree with that as far as
lippie stix go I do have a full review
on their ultra satin lips and their
lippie stix so link both of those down
below if you haven't seen them yet I
never usually give these kind of like
quick swatch videos because I usually
like to give you a full review after I
try out everything but I got a lot of
requests on Instagram for swatches so I
figured we would just do it so if you
