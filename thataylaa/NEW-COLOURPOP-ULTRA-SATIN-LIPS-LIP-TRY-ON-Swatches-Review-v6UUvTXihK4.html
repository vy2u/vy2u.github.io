bright ass ping just come from all right
so it is a Thursday night I literally
just came home from work was about to
hop in the shower because I have five
days worth of dry shampoo in my hair
right now and then this bad boy was in
the mail I definitely should have filmed
the intro before I did five thousands
washes these things are no joke my lips
are on fire it was a good time so these
are the brand spankin new colour-pop
ultra satin lips so I'm just going to do
a quick first impression kind of review
first thoughts on these liquid lipsticks
and then show you guys all sixteen
swashes my pop came out with another
formula and new shades of their liquid
lipsticks I have a whole review on their
matte liquid lipsticks if you want to
see my thoughts on that not a huge fan
of the formula on the ultra matte lips
they're super drying they are affordable
and I do still find myself reaching for
them I feel like just because they have
an insane color range and there's like
two shades that I'm in love with super
excited to see the color pop came out
with the satin lips because I feel like
this is basically like an upgraded
version of their matte liquid lipsticks
color pop comes out with a new line they
just like go ham they came out with
sixteen shades off the bat so came with
this little flower thing at the top and
it doesn't say how much they're going to
retail for but I'm assuming they'll be
the same price as the matte lips it
doesn't say on here when they launched
which I don't know why color pop ever
done that as far as I could tell on
Instagram they launched February 18th
they're not a lip gloss they're bold
lightweight and super comfortable
without that dry matte finish these ones
aren't kiss proof they do transfer but
just from trying to get these things off
these are definitely long wearing I
obviously just got these tonight so I
don't know how long how many hours
they'll last but if you want to know
follow me on snapchat because I'll
probably update you guys there so first
thoughts they go on super smooth super
pigmented I'm trying to think of
something in my collection I have that
compares to the formula I don't really
know if I have anything they're a little
bit tacky I like that you'll
moisturizing without feeling like
they're gonna slide off your lips which
I really like I like having the kind of
tacky feeling so I feel like they're not
just sliding all over my face I only had
trouble applying about one or two shades
all the other ones go on super
pigmented smooth creamy no complaints
with the formula they have pretty much
an exact same smell as the matte one's
super chemically these don't smell good
I really like these don't have a glossy
finish they're definitely more on the
satin matte side I have this paper here
they swatched everything for Instagram
so I'm just going to kiss this you guys
can see how it mattifies afterwards so
you can definitely get it looking pretty
matte still feels comfortable on the
lips like 50 billion times more
comfortable than these ones and you can
still get kind of a matte effect overall
first impressions I'm super pleased with
these I think it's totally worth trying
out a couple shades if you're into it so
if you want to see me freaking slave
over these swatches you're in the right
place just keep watching
you
I only think I just suggested some of
this well man don't drown me I literally
feel like I just scrubbed my lips with
like sandpaper for an hour look at my
hands right now I think so much fun
right now where did that bright ass ping
just come from all right we made it
