burger right now hell yeah all right so
today we have a first impression video
on the brand new covergirl outlast stay
luminous natural glow foundation this is
in the shade 810 the lightest shade this
comes in eight shades I got mine for
around $10 at Fred Meyer I literally had
to go on a mission to four different
stores to find the foundation in my
color you know you live in Seattle when
all of the pale shades are sold out
CoverGirl's original three-in-one
foundation is super popular I personally
didn't like that one just because it
majorly oxidized on my face and it was
way too dark for me by the end of the
day battery just died but we're back was
it talking about it doesn't really say
what kind of coverage is supposed to
give it just says even coverage this is
a first impressions video so I'm going
to show you as I apply it you're gonna
see my initial thoughts and then we're
gonna check in at the end of the day so
you can see how it held up I do have a
get ready with me video on the look and
wearing right now so I'll link it down
below so you guys can go check it out
after you watch this video if you guys
want to see my thoughts on this
foundation you're in the right place
just keep watching all right so I've
already primed my face with the Revlon
Photoready prime and anti Cheyenne bomb
I can't really tell in the bottle if
it's gonna be light enough it kind of
looks like it is it looks like a nice
neutral kind of shade and it has a pump
it says it's supposed to give even
coverage and natural glow that lasts all
day it is rd 245 right now because I've
been working all day at home we're gonna
try and keep this on as long as possible
so I'm just gonna squirt a little bit on
this palette it looks a little bit runny
you can see it sliding down smells like
which is that smell like it smells kind
of like clay I'm gonna do half my face
with my Sigma f80 2 brush is one my
favorite brushes for foundation I feel
like this gives the best coverage on the
other half of my face I'm gonna use the
Beauty Blender start to dab it on my
face maybe I should get a mirror so my
skin has been actually getting a lot
better if this is the first video that
you're seeing of mine you're probably
like what the heck's you're talking
about my skin is nowhere near good right
now but it is getting a lot better but
this is mostly acne scarring let me know
down below if you guys would want to see
a updated skincare routine video
it definitely has a really strong smell
I would say it's a medium light to
medium coverage you can definitely still
see all of my freckles you can still see
acne scarring it does look like a nice
kind of satiny luminous finish not super
dewy but it you can definitely see the
luminosity I'm going to go ahead and use
the Beauty Blender for the other half of
my face I've used a total of two pumps
so far and I just put another two on the
back I feel like the Beauty Blender
might give a little bit better of
coverage than the brush side this time
this definitely is less coverage than
I'm used to wearing all right so this is
how much coverage we get with one layer
the shade is actually fine whenever I've
tried covergirl foundations before they
do oxidize on me so I'm hoping this
doesn't oxidize I'm gonna go in with a
second layer and see how much this
covers and see if it's buildable all
right so it is buildable it doesn't
build to full coverage you can still see
some acne scarring and stuff the finish
of it looks nice the color almost looks
a little bit off to me like a little too
gray another thing I don't know it looks
a little bit dry around my nose I'm
gonna go ahead and apply the rest of my
makeup and I will be right back alright
so the rest of my makeup is on I did
film a tutorial on this look that's
already up so I'll link it in the down
bar if you want to see how I did the
rest of my makeup but I've been sitting
under these brightest lights for about
an hour and 15 minutes now it is a
freaking hot in this room I've been
sweating the entire time I have my ring
light on right now it feels like it's
the Sahara Desert in here so this will
be a test already to see if the
foundation has lasted under this heat
and it looks like it has I can feel
myself like sweating mm-hmm cute I feel
like it looks a little bit better on
camera than it does in real life my
pores look pretty large right now I'm
not super impressed by it at this point
but it looks it looks nice I think if
you didn't have a lot to cover up it
would be looking really nice right now
just by the kind of
rage that I'm used to I usually like a
little bit more I like all of this to be
covered so it is 409 you can't even see
that it is 409 right now so I'm going to
try and leave this on as long as I can
didn't really think that through very
well so I will check back in with you
guys at the end of the night and we'll
see how the foundation held up I was in
like a country accident all right so it
is now 10:15 p.m. this is what the
makeups looking like I was gonna leave
it on longer but I really have to shower
so I could finish getting ready because
I leave for LA in the morning a few
thoughts
there's definitely increasing around my
mouth lines it didn't look Olli when I
looked in the bathroom but now with my
ring light on I feel like it looks a
little bit oily around my nose and a
tiny bit on my forehead but when I go to
feel it there's no oil coming off that's
probably just the finish of it it
definitely did oxidize when I was
looking in the bathroom you can see the
like orange on my neck versus my skin my
overall thoughts I'm not super impressed
with it I don't think you need to go run
out and buy it right now if you want to
try it out you might as well try it out
you can always return it I'm going to
try mixing it in with my cover effects
drops and see how that works but we will
see so if you guys liked this video and
you want to see more person prescience
videos give it a thumbs up so I know
love you guys thanks for watching and
see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
