all right so today we're gonna be trying
out a bunch of stuff from a brand new
brand brand new brand at Walgreens it's
called CYO I love trying out new
drugstore makeup especially when it's an
entire new drugstore brand I can't even
fit all this in my hand we got pretty
much a full face of CYO going on I
ordered all this stuff online and it was
actually buy was it was it buy two get
one free something sango's buy two get
one free on Walgreens and also their
entire line everything is under 8 bucks
which is awesome I did a little bit of
internet searching to see what this
brand is all about it looks like they
have a hundred sixty products in their
line and the prices range from 350 to
750 it seems like they're kind of all
about just doing your own thing with
makeup it says say no to normal say yes
to experimental mix remix layer hack
which I'm all about I kind of just do
whatever with products to make them work
so I'm into that
if you guys are excited for this video
and you're enjoying while you're
watching don't forget to give it a
thumbs up if you want to see how I got
this look and see how a bunch of CYO
makeup does you're in the right place
just keep watching all right so it's
1108 this is one of those days where all
the copy in the world can't wake me up
right now but here we go so Barty wash
moisturize and prime my face this isn't
like a full face UI or anything I did
get a ton of products I think I got
almost a full face if not but we're not
calling it that so I got two different
foundations the first one is the CYO
long lasting life proof foundation in
the shade 101 and then I also got the
matte foundation no shine zone in 2:03
which was the lightest shade this one
only comes in four shades let's see what
the other one came in I just remembered
that one of them said it was more
coverage yeah so this one says medium
coverage they both only come in four
shades this one's seven dollars the
other ones six dollars this one says
medium coverage 24 hour feels light look
smooth never cakey and then the matte
one says medium to full coverage this
one's supposed to have a little bit more
coverage 14 hours staying power goes on
Geremi never cakey and it's matte so I
don't know I might mix the two this
isn't a foundation review or anything so
I might mix the two I have to pick up
some friends in a few hours at the
airport so I think I'm gonna try and
keep this on just to see how everything
wears for a few hours it's not going to
full day wear test I don't think I'm
gonna swatch both of these because 2:03
definitely looks darker wu cui oh I mean
see way of life proof one looks like a
nice shade look at that that's the
lifeproof in the lightest shade that's
the matte foundation the lightest shade
that's the two shades mixed just because
I'm curious what this one looks like on
its own I think I'm gonna first go in
with this one so when you guys are
seeing this I will either be in LA or
I'll have just gotten back all my videos
are pre-recorded right now a few weeks
out because just a lot has been going on
woo this feels like silky or something
like it's just sliding over my skin has
a really nice feel to it and it's
definitely more pink toned which I
personally like I would agree with the
medium coverage not kicking up around my
nose or pores or anything and it feels
like butter
feels pretty moisturizing why am i doing
half my face so used to filming
foundation videos now I guess since
we're here I do the other half with the
sponge anyways I don't really want to
use the matte one right now because I
really like how this one is looking it
still looks pretty with the sponge but
I'm gonna switch back to the brush
getting better coverage and I do like
how it goes on a little bit better with
the brush the way that this is sitting
on my skin is almost reminded me of the
Estee Lauder
actually haven't sitting right here
Double Wear nude that I tested during 15
days of foundation I would still say
this one is a little bit more like
moisturizing and plumping but this is
looking beautiful
I mean just see if I can build this up a
little bit on my acne down here I also
have a concealer I'm gonna use this
underneath my eyes but I looked at the
shade and it's definitely too dark for
the under eyes actually let's just try
this first I'm gonna use it down here
and if the concealer doesn't work out
then I can go in with a little second
layer foundation I'm just blending this
out with the morphe g 38 I love this
brush for spot concealing and also
blending out concealer under my eyes far
away it looks good when you get really
up close is clinging a little bit weird
let's try and build up the foundation on
this side and see if that looks better
gonna stipple it on with a brush and
then
I am feeling this foundation I think
with this one I like doing the first
layer with a brush to get the most
coverage and then just putting on a tiny
bit more with a sponge because the
sponge does give it that like super
flawless smoothing finish this looks
good so because this concealer is a
no-go for me and it's definitely too
dark this is in the lightest shade fair
and I didn't really like how this one
looks on my skin so I'm gonna pass on
that for underneath my eyes I believe
that was the only concealer I saw in
there so I'm just gonna do my normal
concealer underneath my eyes and powder
my under eyes and I will be right back
as I was doing the under eye concealer I
couldn't stop staring at my forehead it
looks so nice and like smooth up there
so I'm kind of scared that this powder
is gonna ruin the finish but I might
just try it on my cheeks first but this
is the matte pressed powder of meet your
matte in fair and this does look pretty
dark for a fair shade this could be a
disaster but I'm just gonna try it on a
small area over here first okay so it's
actually a very sheer which is why it's
not really darkening anything feel soft
I do feel like it just took away some of
the coverage though this happens to me
with certain powders okay I might do the
other cheek and then I don't think I'm
gonna do my forehead yeah that just took
away some of the coverage that's just
kind of a weird thing with my skin so
this powder might be fine on you but on
me it is one of those that takes away
the coverage so I'm not gonna use this
on my forehead I get a brow product in
here somewhere here we go this is the
brow sculpting pencil in dark brown what
did this just say dark there's just
fully on one end so I'm going to use
that it's like one of those angled kind
of pencils which I usually like so let's
try south this has a lot of pigment to
it so it's kind of one of those brow
products that you just have to really
lightly tap or else I think it could
look too intense pretty quickly it's a
little bit too creamy for me like I just
easily got it underneath my brow I
personally like a little bit more of a
stiff brow pencil because you just have
more room to work with it I think some
people might like this one for me it's
just a little bit too much alright so I
picked up their bronzing powder in the
shade fair which looks pretty ORN
that looks very orange Oh No
but I also picked up their contour kiss
this is girls on contour in the shade
fair this one looks more like a bronzer
shade to me but we'll try it out and
then there's also highlight in here
what's a bit too warm for my skin tone I
also don't like how this is like
blending out it's almost blending out
kind of patchy or something I'm gonna go
over this with the sponge just to kind
of tone it down it's weird it's not like
too powdery I don't know there's
something about the formulas I do not
like by the way this was the packaging
for the contour kit I do like the
packaging I think it's nice and like
modern I thought this was blush but it
says bronzing rocks on the back of here
in fair medium so these are like little
exactly what it sounds like bronzing
mousse look pretty okay maybe I'll add a
little bit of this on top I don't mind
like a slightly illuminating bronzer it
almost looks like I could use this as
blush try to splash I also got this
blush though where did that just go most
literally just holding it dude what the
heck you guys I've been staring at this
table for like two minutes trying to
find why I just put that blush down I
actually think it just disappeared into
thin air alright so I guess we're going
in with these that blush actually broke
in the mail anyways let's go into these
things these look fun there's something
about these that just aren't blending
out like my concealer right here
definitely more intense on camera in
real life it looks like these are
blended but for some reason on a camera
I'm getting this like stark line right
here so I'm gonna just try and blend
some more
there's the blush where was that little
e but this is the crush on blush and
tell it straight again this broke in the
mail oh it looks pretty though looks
like a nice shade definitely more of a
shimmery blush again so for a highlight
I'm really excited to try this this is
the bronzing and highlighting palette
shimmer switch in in the clouds and I'm
assuming you could use these as
eyeshadows too I mean I would but this
light pink shade right here looks nice
I'm just gonna kind of mix these two
light pink shades is pretty powdery ooh
that's pretty
oh that's really pretty what the heck
not like overly emphasizing my texture
it has a really pretty Sheen to it
whoo super pretty and put this on my
nose Cupid's bow look at that that one I
would definitely use again I'm gonna use
this setting spray this is the fixing
spray set to last trace out and give it
a shake well smells pretty alcoholic but
it has a nice fine mister on it and it
feels like it's drying down very fast
probably because of the alcohol yeah
alcohol is a second ingredient in here
that setting spray just dried down very
fast case feels like more not dry in a
bad way but it just feels like you know
wow I'm really describing things very
well today since I don't have an eye
primer from them I'm just gonna take my
usual Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre so
when I was shopping on Walgreens online
I think I saw two eyeshadow palettes and
either one really was appealing to me
but I picked up this one this is the
Rainbow Warrior I don't know the shades
in both of the palettes
I wasn't that drawn to the packaging of
this feels a bit cheap so here's the
colors and definitely I'm using some of
the other products on my eyes as well
because you need some transition shades
and things so these are looks like cream
shadows what is this one supposed to be
this looks like almost an eyebrow wax so
I'm gonna take that bronzer shade
because it looks like a nice warm hi
shadow tone oh dude yeah no way as a
bronzer looks nice as an eye shadow
though Pizza sounds so bomb right now I
don't even have breakfast yet okay I
really like that as an eyeshadow that's
pretty I don't even know what look I'm
into I want to do like a glowy kind of
look with these but I feel like I need
to use this eyeshadow palette what if I
just use the blush and do like a pink
gold kind of thing I don't know these
colors I'm just like not feeling right
now I think we are going to improvise
their whole thing is that you can what
was it hashtag mix layer hack so we are
mixing and hacking I'm not gonna use
that eye shadow palette I'm gonna take
the blush I'm just gonna use my finger
put this right on the lid I think I feel
like that shade would be really pretty
as blush actually looks a lot more
subtle on
and it does in the pan now I'm gonna go
back in with the strimmer thing and take
the deepest shade in here looks like a
bronzy who else pretty oh yeah
alright this thing you need this is
super pretty I'm definitely gonna go
back in with this thing in a minute and
try and wet it but first I'm gonna take
this contour shade and put that into the
crease yeah this one I don't know this
is like not that great just kind of feel
like it disappears or something does
something weird on the skin was there a
black eyeshadow in that tell it there's
like a dark purple maybe I'll use that
one I'm gonna take a little bit of that
purple I don't know where this look is
going right now a bit into the crease
layered on top of those Browns almost
just looks like a darker Brown can't
really see the purple a lot I'm really
having to build up the shadow and I've
dipped my brush in like 50 times I'm
gonna go back into this thing and take
this kind of champagne shade right here
I'm also gonna spray it with that same
setting spray see if we can get it to
really pop there we go so those can
definitely work as eyeshadows super
pretty wet yeah this setting spray
really dries almost instantly so for the
inner corner I'm going to take the same
lightest shade that I used as a
highlight I'm gonna wet it again I
really like that first bronzer shade as
eyeshadow it's a really pretty tone I'm
gonna take that again and put it on the
lower lash line I have two eyeliners
here I have the marker pen for like a
winged liner and then a cold gel liner
so I'm gonna use this on the waterline
this is supposed to be black but it
almost looks like grey it's not the
blackest black I'm gonna take this and
run it right between the waterline and
my lashes and then I'm gonna take a flat
edge liner brush and just kind of blend
that out a little bit I think I would
pass on this eyeliner they're definitely
better black liners from the drugstore
favorite one is the LA girl glide on gel
pencil that one is bomb and it's like a
couple bucks I go back in with the kind
of purple eyeshadow and smudge that
right below a little bit of fallout
all of the AI products that are intended
as AI products so far are kind of like
doing the job I just wouldn't recommend
that you buy them let's try out this
eyeliner so this is the eyeliner marker
pen 3 and easy three and easy what is
that supposed to mean
I think they had another liquid liner
too but that one was kind of more of
like a brush liquid liner this one is oh
now I know why it's called three I don't
know about easy but there's three little
weird what the heck is this this is
definitely gonna be a first
I've never seen an eyeliner quite like
this do you guys see those three really
tiny little prong things what the actual
heck this looks like a little pitchfork
or something what do I do with this let
me see if they say anything online about
how to use this it literally says
nothing about the three frigging prongs
they have on here it just says use at
the gym or by the pool smudge free liner
that you can take anywhere smudge free
flicks even the felines will be jealous
of all says glide across your lash line
for precise line that lasts okay I feel
like they should have some kind of photo
or something of this applicator because
this is not normal here we go wish me
luck I'm really trying to figure out
what this was intended for and how to
correctly use this I mean I'm getting a
really black line but I'm just kind of
using one side of it I have no idea how
this wing is gonna go kind of scared
okay we got this okay you can't actually
get a tip with this because the tip even
if you try and turn it so you're only
using that kind of end right there you
can't get like an actual tip so I think
I'm just gonna go in with this liner
already started doing like a little wing
so I might just kind of follow that and
just smudge out the end yeah this liner
definitely looks like gray that worked
so let's attempt to do the same thing on
the other eye so to help get a little
bit more of like an actual line out
there I just used the same brush by the
way this is the morphe 43 and I just
kind of ran it across the product brow
in last row says
in the shade fair media so this is like
a brown eyebrow gel I guess if you
wanted to brown mascara looks pretty
light but maybe I'll try just on the
front this has quite a large one to be a
brow gel totally just saw this and this
is where I was going now I remember
I think I was gonna do like a cool toned
look cuz I got this metallic shadow and
then I think I was gonna use this
palette I'm gonna swatch this just see
you guys can see what it looks like but
this is the metallic eyeshadow in crush
on metal oal looks pretty that might be
pretty wet but it's a little bit chalky
and it kind of just like disappears a
bit when you swatch it okay so I'm gonna
put on false lashes because these are
dying anyways those are the Ardell faux
mink 8-11 lashes I'm gonna go in with
these and I would be right back okay
slashes are on the lash glue is still
drying so I'll probably go over it with
the eyeliner afterwards cuz you can
still kind of see it I got two lip
products the metallic liquid lipstick
it's like this pinky shade what is this
case you're wondering this is not a food
this is in the shade plead the fifth
smells like cake hmm good okay whoa is
super pretty
that is gorgeous if you're into metallic
lipsticks it doesn't feel like a
metallic lipstick that dries down you
can definitely still feel it it doesn't
feel tacky it just feels kind of like
creamy this doesn't seem to be
transferring to my teeth yeah I also got
a lip gloss in the shade your best side
it's like this light pinky kind of gloss
ooh that looks like it could potentially
be pretty alright so this is the final
look I think out of everything I'm
definitely most into the CYO
long-lasting foundation I'm gonna do a
check-in I think in a few hours I just
want to see how this foundation holds up
in a few hours so I'm gonna be a super
long check-in or anything just before I
have to go to the airport I also really
like the bronzing and highlighting
palette clearly you can use these as
eyeshadows I think as a highlighter this
is gorgeous like the metallic lipstick
that's everything that I liked I
wouldn't get the bronzer shade to use as
a bronzer on my skintone but I think as
eyeshadow it's really pretty like I
would use this again as eyeshadow
everything else I think I would pass on
I'm gonna try and use the matte
foundation I'll keep this for another
video I also got this which I totally
forgot about this is the illuminating
mixing cream turn on the light
let's just watch this maybe we'll use
this in the shadow which means to but
you can mix this in with foundations
it's supposed to give it kind of a glow
that looks pretty it's definitely not
like a cream illuminator this does look
like an illuminating mixing product
which is nice as it doesn't look like
it's overboard so see you guys in a few
hours my false lashes will probably be
off okay it's now 5:15 I put on my
makeup this morning around 11:00 so it's
been on for over six hours now
I had soup and cereal adulting so my
lipstick has pretty much worn off I mean
there's like a little bit of remnants of
it but definitely worn off so I wouldn't
say it's long wearing by any means it
just feels like a liquid lipstick not
one that dries down but it doesn't
transfer which I like and it didn't feel
too like sticky and heavy I took off my
false lashes because my eyeballs were
burning but six hours I think the
foundation still looks nice I am getting
a little bit of upper lip creasing but I
still like how it looks on my forehead
it just looks nice and like healthy and
glowy I'm obsessed with this highlight
definitely gonna be wearing the
highlight again this video won't be
going up for a couple weeks so
definitely have had a chance to try out
the foundation again so update you my
thoughts on it in the description box
down below I like the shade and I think
it looks nice alright so that was
everything I hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you did make sure you give it a
thumbs up it helps me out if you're new
here you can join the big radio family I
upload every Monday Wednesday Friday at
6 p.m. Pacific time I love you guys
