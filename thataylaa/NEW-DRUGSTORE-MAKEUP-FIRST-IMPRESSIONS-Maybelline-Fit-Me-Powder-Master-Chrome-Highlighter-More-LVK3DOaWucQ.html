bottom here
all right so today we're doing a
full-face testing out new drugstore
makeup 99% these are first impressions
there's also a ton of Maybelline in
here half my filming space and
background and everything now set up in
the new apartment so let me know what
you guys think let's jump into it I
don't have any of my makeup unpacked yet
the rest of my house is totally put
together except this room so I dug
through what I could to find makeup for
this video all over the place right now
likes man life so if you guys are
excited for this video don't forget to
give it a thumbs up if you want to see
how I got this look and what I think of
some new products from the drugstore
your inner eye please just keep watching
alright I just got everything set up
this is so weird having so much room for
all the activities there's a long desk
now I have an actual organized basket
with all of the products I'm going to be
trying out my face is looking a little
orange today I put on self-tanner last
night and I still have to wash it off
just so weird I can have two elbows on
the table right now for primer I have
two different Revlon options I want to
try out the Revlon Photoready pore
reducing primer and then the brightening
primer by the way cut my finger
attempting to cook I think I want to try
the pore reducing primer today so I need
a clip let's just put this behind here
so my face is looking a little wild
right now but once I have foundation on
it'll all be good whoa this feels like
them what does it feel like I actually
feel like my pores especially on this
side look a little bit blurred bunch are
a little bit more right here and see
what happens
yeah what the heck okay that legit just
blurred my pores so this doesn't break
me out most pore filling primers do
because of silicone and stuff I'm
rocking the nail polish over shellac
look right now so for a foundation this
is the only thing that's not going to be
drugstore I'm just going to put on the
Clinique continuous coverage makeup
creamy glow because this is like one of
the two foundations that I have that are
actually dark enough for the self tan
right now swatch all of my darker
drugstore foundations like the better
skin and everything and those are all
too light so I'm just going to go in
with this actually looking like this one
might be too light well I think even
this is too light right now that's crazy
because this is usually friggin dark on
me I just actually use this and then use
a darker powder because I do have a
powder I want to try for concealer this
is drugstore price this is an awesome
affordable concealer this is
cosmetic studio pro concealer braved
about this this is in the shade 102
though which I haven't shown on camera
yet this is what I've been using is I
have the self-tanner on so foundation
concealer technically not a first
impression but everything else is was my
hand up in the air right now
alright so to set my face and my under
eyes I want to try out this new
Maybelline fit me loose powder super
curious about these I have a few
different shades Maybelline sent a
ton of stuff in PR so I might mix the
shade 10 and 25 for under my eyes or
just use 10 and then go in with one the
darker shades for my face there's a
little sister thing and sealant on here
I can get this enough so really have to
shake this thing like this is not you
need to get product out of like I'm
using a shake weight right now so I'm
going to try to show you 10 underneath
my eyes if this is too light I can
always darken it up a little bit I don't
usually like loose powders under my eyes
especially translucent it never really
sits well underneath my eyes but this is
like an actual powder can work that
doesn't look bad can't see out of my
right eye that looks fine under there it
looks a little creepy I definitely still
prefer my normal under-eye powders but
lush eyes for the face I have no idea
what shade I am right now I think I need
to go in with the darker one this shade
30 looks like my normal bronzer color
I mean darker than my face right now but
I think it'll actually match my body
clinging on a little bit in weird spots
I think my face on camera is still
looking a little bit lighter than my
chest but in real life it actually
matches perfectly right now this one's
coming out way easier so I think I just
had a little defective sister on number
10 now that that's all blended out my
skin is looking pretty nice very matte
right now but it looks nice
the only brow product I have to try out
is this shaping chalk I'm going to go in
with my normal brow pomade to get like
the shape going and then I'll try out
this guy so this is in the shade deep
Brown I'm going to kind of just use this
to like fill in certain areas that I
didn't totally fill in with pomade
Maybelline has been coming out with some
interesting brow products lately there's
like balls in here so basically looks
like there's powder in here and then
kind of a wand applicator this color
looks a little bit light but this is the
darkest one oh yeah the color is
definitely light I can definitely see it
going on I almost like adds texture to
your actual hairs too and it looks like
I just put on benefit gimme brow just
primed my eyes for face I'm super
excited to try this out this is the
Maybelline master bronze in the shade 10
this one is actually kind of shimmery
why am i doing this my left hand that
one could either be a very subtle
highlight or like a shimmery kind of
bronzer this one is definitely a
highlighting to bronzer shades this one
has a little bit of glitter in it I
think I'm gonna try out of this guy
and we'll also see how powder blends on
top of that Maybelline powder mmm I like
that a lot
I'm gonna take this warmer shade right
here on a blush brush the morphe y5 and
i'm just going to put that on my temples
kind of like in those two shades a lot
right now hunt it out really easily and
like the tone of both of them blush I
have been using this but this is the
Physicians Formula butter blush in the
shade rosy pink so when they're new
color releases I think they release two
new shades maybe three that's just a
nice pink and they smell so good
you can literally smell it from like out
here out of everything this highlight is
what I'm most excited to try out because
I've heard people just raving about this
this is the master chrome metallic
highlighter in 100 molten gold
I've only swatch this I / this on
snapchat but I haven't actually put this
on my face yet from the swatch I think
this shade would be too dark on my
normal skin tone but right now I think
it'll definitely work why do I feel like
it doesn't look quite as good as it does
on other people looking a bit textured I
can just see it like a line right here I
mean when it hits the light it does look
pretty I'm going up a little bit more
maybe that's the key oh there we go now
we're really getting the top I'm not
totally loud I don't know why it just
kind of looks like a stripe of eyeshadow
on my face right now I need to go back
in and blend this because it literally
just looks like a stripe maybe I'll add
a little bit of the highlight from this
palette to try it out
okay I can already tell I like this one
better I want to bring a little bit of
that up here just get a little bit of a
glow going maybe if you don't have a lot
of face tester this one would look
better before eyeshadow I have for
Maybelline palettes so these are the new
city mini palettes there's like a
purplish one kind of a warm brown bronzy
gold one blues and then this pink one
which looks like there's some nice matte
and transition shades in this one so I
think I'm gonna start out with this I
don't know what I like I'm doing story
of my life when I go in with this kind
of cream shade right here might be too
light to use as a transition right now I
ordered a new lens that I think will be
good because I'll be able to zoom in
right now I have a fixed lens so I can't
actually zoom in when I'm doing like
eyes and stuff yeah this is a little
light okay I'm actually going to use my
contour palette a bronzer palette this
thing there's going to start out with
that same shade right there and put this
into the crease adding some of the
warmer shade to that I used on my
temples in the rooftop bronzes palette
this shade right here is just calling my
name
look at that that looks super pretty
think first so I'm going to deepen up my
outer corner a little bit I'm gonna go
back with that first toilet which is
downtown sunrise and use this brown
shade right here they're blending out
super easily I'm craving Krispy Kremes
so bad right now I've been watching less
long videos lately and it just makes you
crave all the worst foods like at 11
p.m. last night I was trying to
strategize how I could go to Krispy
Kreme do a thing before going on with
that shade I'm going to take a little
bit of this pink right here on my finger
who should I go all in and do this one
this is like real pink kind of do it I'm
gonna try not the most pigmented like
you got to really press your finger in
here and then press it on your lids I
think would definitely help the wet so
I'm going to do that I'm just going to
oh my coffee goes right there I'm just
going to spray my brush with some
Catrice setting spray that just went all
over everything
whoops
you do have to really build this up
there's also a light pink shimmery shade
right here that I kind of want to try
and put this on the inner corner there
pretty you just really have to build
them up I still really want to try this
shade so I'm just going to take that on
my finger again and layer that on oh
yeah that one's pretty I'm not used to
my awkward hands being in this frame
usually it's like here up I'm going to
take this warmer brown shade again and
blend that on the lower lash line so I
have two different eyeliner options I
can try out both by Maybelline this is a
curvature liner so this one looks
interesting this thing is basically
totally bent so apparently it's supposed
to be able to make it easier to kind of
hold and get your wings that looks like
she's in a poker eyeball out and then
this one is the master precise ink I
might use this one as a backup in case
this is a total fail to them really
curious about this I feel like
Maybelline just tries every single shape
as eyeliner okay so this is curved I'm
assuming you're supposed to hold it
where it's a diagram okay she's holding
it like this that is not going to fly I
would assume like that's a curve down
because it's felt-tip so it's not the
blackest ink it isn't going over shimmer
very well a curve as far as this part of
Maya doesn't seem to make it any easier
so now I'm going to turn it so it's
curved the other way I mean not the
worst wing I've ever done the actual
point on the tip is pretty fine so it's
not super hard to get that point
yeah the curve does nothing except kind
of make your life harder out of all of
me Blaine's weird eyeliners I don't hate
this one I don't think is anything
special I don't recommend it but I mean
it worked and at least I had a fine
point so it's easy to get that wing the
curve just doesn't help at all in the
actual formula isn't super black so I
kind of want to go over it with the
Maybelline precise ink liner just to see
if this adds a little bit more black
this one is more like a bendy kind of
liquid liner tip so it's still a felt
tip but it looks more like a brush
applicator not the softest applicator
for mascara winter out the covergirl
total tease and the web
but this packaging is very attractive to
me I'm going to put on false lashes
today so I'm just going to do a thin
coat of this of this brown
oh it's brown woah this has a really
really strong smell what the heck is
this applicator how do you even use this
in a close-up of the band-aid
so that weird tiny thing on the end is
supposed to be like an inner corner kind
of separating things when your lashes
get clumpy you can use on your inner
corner out or whatever and then the
other side is like the one to apply the
mascara it looks like there's a bug
stuck to the bottom of here to me it
looks like this is curved the wrong way
you probably use the tiny thing for your
lower lash line to I mean nothing
special just looks like a normal natural
looking mascara I'll go back in with
this for the bottom lashes after I put
on salty so I'm just going to use the I
lower number 121 slashes are on 121
they're like my all-time favorite
drugstore lashes why can I not hear out
of this ear at all right now can't even
blow it out because of foundation I'm
going to go back in with this and use
that tiny little end to try and do my
bottom lashes I'm not feeling this not
into this mascara at all gone with my
normal wet and wild Magelang okay I have
like 5000 lip options right now think of
every color in each of these so these
aren't the actual colors I'm using but
just to show you guys this is the
covergirl melting pout gel liquid
lipstick this kind of raised me of the
Too Faced melted what was the name of
those you know I'm talking about
and there's the maybelline superstay
matte ink I'm really curious to try
these out but I heard from you guys on
snapchat that these lasts forever and
are really hard to get off your lips and
I need to wash all this off and go
camping in like a half hour I'm not
trying to put on like a permanent liquid
lipstick right now but I will try these
out in a different video shadow moves or
something and then the Maybelline vivid
hot lacquer I think I'm going to go in
with these I have a different color that
I want to try out this is the shade 60
T's it looks like a nice nude kind of
more cool toned so I'm gonna start out
with a Maybelline 105 nude whisper liner
this is one of my favorite liners let's
try out this I think this is going to be
glossy yeah definitely
wooo that Shay
keep in mind this is going to look a lot
more nude with this color skin I have
going on than normally this would
probably be like a medium tone nude on
me it feels like melted butter going on
it feels super smooth it almost feels
like the Loreal color I think it's of
color racial lip glosses and the
applicator is actually really similar on
this too you have this like triangle
kind of applicator smells kinda like
vanilla sunscreen this is already
transferring onto my teeth so hopefully
it's not one of those that doesn't so
yeah really nicely pigmented it feels
super comfortable on the lips not overly
sticky at all it feels really similar to
the L'Oreal lip gloss I'm really into
the shade alright so everything is on my
face I think out of everything I trade
out I'm most excited about the Revlon
Photoready pore reducing primer I
actually feel like this did something
for my pores and my forehead looks
really nice and smooth right now which
also could have been the powder but I do
feel like this helper a loose powder so
far I'm liking this one I definitely
want to see how this wears throughout
the day I'm gonna try that again and see
if it makes me any more or less oily oh
yeah this is already transference but
right now I think my skin looks pretty
good into shade 10 would work for me
normally so once the self tan is worn
off I'll try this out this one I don't
like on my skin the master chrome I
don't know there's something about it
I'm just not that wowed by it and I feel
like my highly it looks more textured
than normal I really like the master
bronze palette you can use this for
eyeshadow I think the highlight in here
is pretty nice to him excited to use it
by itself
whoo yeah still super soft yeah I'm
really excited to use the highlight on
its own because that looks super pretty
but I like both shades that I tried out
of here they blend it out easily they
weren't overly pigmented I like the tone
of them and then the vivid hot lacquer I
love the color of this it is
transferring to my teeth every two
seconds and I've already blotted the
inside of my mouth so just keep that in
mind if that's something that bothers
you you probably wouldn't like this but
as far as the actual formula and how
it's looking on my list it feels and
looks really nice the city mini palettes
that I tried I think you could probably
pass on these are workable but for the
amount of layers that I had to put on to
get this kind of pigment a little
ridiculous I think I literally went in
about 10 times with that same shade I'm
sure there's some nice shades in each
one of these I just don't know if
they're worth going out and purchasing
these for so I think that is everything
