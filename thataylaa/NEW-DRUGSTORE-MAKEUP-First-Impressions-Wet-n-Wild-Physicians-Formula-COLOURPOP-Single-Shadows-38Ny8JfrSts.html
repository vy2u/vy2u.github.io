all right so I just filmed this entire
video was importing the footage peeled
off my lashes was living my life getting
comfy and then realized they totally
forgot to film the intro both lashes are
back on we are here that kind of day
so last week I filmed a whole video just
like this for a new drugstore products
first impressions there is so much out
at the drugstore right now if you missed
that video I'm going to put it in the
eye which is on this side but I actually
found tons of new products at Fred Meyer
a couple days ago so I asked you guys on
snapchat if you wanted to see another
one and you did and these are some of my
favorite videos to film I love trying
out new drugstore makeup I'm also doing
a wear test in this video so you guys
will actually see how it wears
throughout the day so if you guys like
these videos make sure you give it a
thumbs up so I know if you're new here
you can join the BAE Rito family and
subscribe it will notify you every time
I put up a new video if you are already
a part of a radio fam make sure you turn
on the notifications if you click the
little bell by the subscribe button
it'll notify you every time I upload you
never know when YouTube just doesn't
want to put your video in someone's feed
so if you want to be notified when my
videos go live make sure you have the
Bell notifications turned on also very
exciting we have a new audio in this
video it should be a whole other world
compared to what it was before I got a
new mic it's on the tripod it's fancy
hopefully you can't hear the background
noise as much or the echo I have a
feeling it's going to be good so fingers
crossed I'm hungry alright it's going to
do the video there's construction going
on right now and someone is moving in so
let's pin back her hair I have already
washed and moisturize my face but I have
a prime because I have a primer that
we're going to try out got my
jack-in-the-box iced mocha my new
addiction sometimes they make them
better than others sir you made a fine
iced mocha this morning so like I
probably told you in the intro there was
tons of new Physicians Formula stuff
that I haven't seen anything about yet
this is the Physicians Formula insta
ready face primer says it's a mattifying
primer with SPF 18 breathable and non
greasy absorbs instantly extends makeup
wear and the person is coming back let's
put this primer on when I bought this I
was actually thinking it was the sticks
but it is not it is a pump so it looks
like a queer silicone kind of condition
let's go ahead what is this scent it
smells like pink yeah it smells like
house pink literally full as bed well it
feels really nice and smooth oh it
doesn't feel super silicon it feels a
little bit more lightweight but it
doesn't feel greasy my face feels like a
baby's butt right now
hopefully Chang has a peeping outside so
next is this Physicians Formula cushion
primer it says corrector primer yellow
green so the yellow supposed to correct
dark circles and dullness and the green
is supposed to correct redness so
packaging looks like their other cushion
foundation which I do have a whole
review on and there's a nine dollar off
rebate on here which is pretty good I
think I picked it with a noisiest day
possible to try and fill this but here's
the packaging looks like super cute you
open this up like a normal cushion
product so on the box it says was
supposed to basically be a color
correcting primer so you could use this
without primer technically so I'm going
to use the green color on some of my
acne and redness and then maybe we'll
try a little bit of yellow under my eyes
I rarely rarely and I rarely I mean
almost never use color corrector and we
go in with this brush works brush it's
just like a tiny little thing and let's
go in with green so this is a really
light green color I do is color
correcting is that your theoretically
supposed to have to use less foundation
or concealer on top of it because you've
already neutralized the area I don't
really color crush because I like more
full coverage foundations anyway that it
usually just covers it and it's kind of
an unnecessary step but if you want to
use less product or less coverage
foundation color correctors could be
helpful for you I can get slightly
neutralizing I'm going to go in with
that yellow now let's use a little bit
of this under the eyes so for foundation
I'm not doing a part that I haven't
tried out before I'm actually going to
do a combo of the wet and wild photo
focus foundation in porcelain with the
elf acne fighting foundation again like
the other video if I don't have a brand
new release
try out and do like a first impression
on I'm just going to use other drugstore
products I haven't tried out these two
together before so we shall see this is
a new foundation I have a full
foundation Friday video on this I go in
with my
your morphine 31 brush with this one
layer I'm getting pretty much almost
full coverage not covering some of my
acne spots but this guy just wants to
chill today okay so this I am super
curious to try this is new from again
Physicians Formula this is a it says
it's a cool coverage concealer so I'm
excited this is the insta ready full
coverage concealer and it has a freaking
sponge oh I thought it was attached that
sure just comes with a sponge so that's
kind of cool
that was going to be a weird contraption
with a sponge on the top so I have the
lightest shade fair Physicians Formula
concealers and foundations tend to run
pretty dark so I do have a backup in
case it's way too dark I have the NYX
lavender concealer here this is an
awesome drugstore concealer for
lightening your concealer I like this
better than a lot of white concealers
I've tried the formulas gray it's full
coverage really hard to find light
drugstore concealers so if you need to
lighten it use this guy it's always
talked about that product in my videos
and I haven't mentioned it in a while
I'm gonna let this thing and we're going
to try it
welcome only channel for the win that
didn't get a whole lot bigger it is nice
and squishy okay so it actually looks
like the Mac Pro Longwear concealer the
packaging looks super similar to that
I'm just gonna squirt some out on my
finger and use my fingers to apply
underneath you guys if it ever comes out
of here so it would think we're getting
somewhere
watch it squirt out right kisses oh yeah
it's coming I feel it try this guy out
woo
feels super nice and creamy definitely
too dark for my skin tone so I'm gonna
have to add some that mix on top um heck
yeah very moisturizing
just like the Mac Pro Longwear it is
difficult to get a tiny bit out kind of
just goes everywhere my skin tone this
isn't doing any lightning at all I
actually think I could use this to kind
of spot conceal on the rest of my face
it looks pretty full coverage to me if
you have a darker skin tone than I do I
am feeling this concealer I'm actually
used a tiny bit more two spot conceal on
the rest of my face just some areas that
the foundation didn't totally cover and
I'm going to use this sponge because I
totally just forgot to use it aren't you
going to take the rounder side and just
spot conceal a little bit so to brighten
up the under eyes a little bit I am
going to
that Knicks lavender usually I mix this
in with my concealer a little bit but
this will work fine okay not a fan of
the sponge for under the eyes I'm going
to use my normal stargazer powder to set
my under eyes so that'll help brighten
everything up and make it look more even
who I have a new one here so next I'm
going to try out this white and wild
brand new powder I finally found this
thank you for admire I've been on the
hunt for this and the concealer for
forever I still haven't been able to
find the concealer but we got the powder
this comes in eight shades they're only
four shades on the display I had luckily
they had the lightest shade which is 821
II warm light this whole photo focus
line is supposed to be good for
photography selfies flash photography
everything going on with my morphe 52
brush let's see what you got
don't usually use this brush for powder
but I left mine at home
I think it's a little bit dark but what
I usually do is mix my foundation a tiny
bit lighter so that when I put on a
press powders I know I'm going to be
using one it'll darken it to be my skin
tone don't really have a whole lot of
socks on the powder with the foundation
combo I use this doesn't look like
anything spectacular in the last video I
use the new Loreal brow pomade so today
I'm going to switch it up and use my
Ardell dark brown brow pomade this is
one of my favorite brow products I've
used quite a bit of this so browser on
I'm going to prime my eyes using the
Catrice prime and spine brightening eye
primer I've used this a couple times
before I should have probably done this
before I put on a case product but
that's okay okay so this I was super
excited to see this is new by essence
and you can find essence at Ulta or at
Fred Meyer this shade right here looks
like it could be a really nice fair
contour shade so we're going to give
this a go there's a couple of shimmery
shades this one looks like a highlight
and then this one if you have a deeper
skin tone you could use those as a
highlight not to oranjee I feel like I
was not at contour and bronzer drought
for a while like I couldn't find one
that I really liked and lately I have a
ton and the contour video is coming I
know I said that for like weeks now I
have a legitimate reason I
fine for the life of me one of the
product so I had to reorder it so I'm
waiting for it to come in and then as
soon as it comes in I'm filled in that
video
blends out really nice and easily too so
this is from Bronx colors which is a new
line carry to Ulta it's online only
right now I tried out their foundation
in the other video this is in the shade
it doesn't say in here this looks a
little intense for my skin tone it looks
a little bit different online so I might
just use a super light hand with this
when you use my morphe y5 brush and
literally just lightly tapping it looks
a little bit patchy to me so for a
highlight I'm going to try the shades
they don't have any other new ones to
try right now from the drugstore I
tested out the new Physicians Formula
trio highlight contour in the last video
I love that one if you want a very very
intense highlight I'm taking the morphe
M 510 brush looks a little bit glittery
yes and it's totally emphasizing the
texture not a huge fan of this one is
actually looking better on camera in
real life this is totally emphasizing
all of my pores right here so before we
go on to eyes I'm going to set the face
and shake on two brand new setting
sprays the first is the Physicians
Formula and sturdy and then the second
one is Milan you make it last I'm really
drawn to this packaging for some reason
it looks like a nice frosted glass
bottle even though it's plastic and
pretty sure yeah this one says you can
use it as a skin crap before makeup as a
setting spray or as a misting spray to
stay throughout the day of refresh the
skin I want to try this one highlight
color I told myself I'm not buying
anymore setting sprays because they
literally have an entire drawer
dedicated to setting sprays I go through
them though actually I'm going to test
the mister first mmm not good
Oh sounds like perfume when I think
that's the best smelling setting sprays
over smell and it did have a really nice
fine mist to it okay I do actually feel
like it helps kind of settle some of the
powder into my skin my foundation looks
a little bit smoother now Milani you
need to make this into a perfume before
eyeshadow I am super
because colour-pop came out with new
single eyeshadows I'm a few single ones
here and then I have a couple of their
pre-made palettes I guess technically
you can't find color pop at the
drugstore but it's drugstore pricing
it's not more affordable and the single
shadows are now available on their
website haven't played around with any
have only watched this one which felt
beautiful and a bunch of you on snapchat
I wanted to see these in action I don't
want to do a full video on all of them
yet because I have them all in these
things and I need to order another Z
palette put them in so this one is
called Loki and then this palette is
called high-maintenance I'm actually
gonna start out by taking that same
contour shade that we used with me right
now I don't have a color plot transition
shades it's light enough I'll use that
same m5 11 brush and I'm going to go in
with this shade right here and the Loki
palette I'm not sure how much these
shadows are retailing for it didn't say
on the card in the package but they are
releasing January 13th so buy time guys
to this video
they'll be live so I'll put the price
down below in the description box mm
that felt like butter these are super
soft just from the high maintenance
palette kind of want to go in with this
rose gold copper show you this looks
super pretty
I'm going to go in with this single
shade called nine new morphe seventeen
the pigmentation of these and how
they're blending out is reminds me of
the Anastasia Modern Renaissance palette
I'm going with the shade tiger single
shade which looks a little bit similar
to that first one we use just a little
bit more yellow mustard yellow I'm use
that same brush wipe it off a little bit
and then going with this yellow shade to
blend oh I like this shades my heart
rate is set up I want to go in with this
rose gold shade because this is too
pretty if I don't have nails on usually
I just go in with my middle finger to
apply blood shades because you just get
the best color payoff with your finger
but since I have nails on I'm going in
with this brush this is the Coastal
Scents BRS what does this brcs
20 my favorite brush for going in with
lid color if I do use a brush I feel
like it applies it the best but I
usually still go over it with my finger
afterwards but I just
place it with us first full Alicia sees
I hope this is picking up on camera
alright colour-pop officially killin it
with you shadows I'm gonna go back in
with a tiny bit more of that brown shade
just to blend into that I'm going to
take tiger and blend that on the lower
lash line I'm going to take a dab of
that brown shade again and blend this
mostly on the outer third color pop
you're done good I'm debating if I want
to do liner or just going with youth
lashes user the kiss foaming collection
and midnight they're brand new I showed
these in the other video as well I kind
of want to go in with these if we're
doing a full day wear test I'm going to
have to peel these off in a couple hours
because my eyes just can't hang with
falsies all day I'm just going to do a
spin coat of mascara before applying
falsies word to the wise don't use this
Revlon lash glue it says this took
literally 20 minutes longer than needed
to put on false lashes they're more
intense on the outer half so it just
makes your eyes look really nice and
open so for lipstick I want to try with
a wet and wild megalast
liquid katsu I think I've tried one of
these a while ago the dark red shade I
can carefully did it in a shadowy
schmooze I'm not sure if they just
release more shades or if I tried a
different one maybe I try a different
one but this is in the shade rebel Rose
doesn't smell the greatest smells like
chemicals well this is very rose feels
nice and moisturizing going on the wand
is a little bit frayed so you don't get
that super clean line almost like
feathering a little bit I do really like
this shade and it feels nice and
moisturizing it doesn't feel like it's
totally dried down yet and it's been
about a minute
yeah it's still transferring a little
bit so I am going to keep my face on and
see how all these wear throughout the
day it's not going to be a super long
wear test like normal because I'm going
to a thing tonight and I'm going to need
to take all this off so I'm going to try
and keep it on until about 5 probably it
is now 11:30 so we should still get
about 5-6 hours of wear but I want to
tell you what I'm liking just based off
the first impressions Milani setting
spray the smell of this you need to just
go smell it
we'll see how it holds up throughout the
day the Physicians Formula concealer my
under eyes look really
nice and smooth right now there's not an
increasing happening the weight of this
blended on is so creamy but
full-coverage feel like this is going to
be a lot of people's new favorite
drugstore concealer if this was light
enough for me I would be all over this
what else did I really like oh the
essence contour product like that shade
a lot the color pop eyeshadows yes you
need to try them off of first
impressions really feel in the color pop
shadows I think they're beautiful think
those are my main wowed by products
right now we'll see how everything wears
throughout the day I will check back in
with you guys in a few hours okay so
it's now 523 so everything has been on
for pretty much thanks six hours I think
the check-in was at 11:30 I haven't
touched anything up I've eaten and back
in the room I have to take all this off
to the botched shower and get ready for
tonight
let's talk about how everything is
looking so six hours obviously is in a
super long wear test I usually do about
10 hours if I can but better than
nothing so I ate soup and toast and
coffee and as you can see it has worn
off a lot on the center especially
because there wasn't really eating any
oily foods it doesn't feel like it
totally dried down to me this whole day
is felt kind of sticky I don't know I
feel like I'm not enjoying this liquid
lipstick as much as a lot of people are
it just doesn't feel totally comfortable
to me because I can feel it on my lips
it doesn't feel nearly as drying us the
Jordana one but I actually prefer the
Jordana one to this and I also don't
like the applicator how it was kind of
afraid I found it difficult to get a
really clean line space products is
obviously difficult to speak apart
what's really doing what because I tried
a new primer setting spray and
Foundation combo but my face I think
looks pretty good six hours in no major
oil yet my concealer under my eyes also
looks good still a little bit of
creasing but I usually get that nothing
major all traditions formula please come
out with a lighter shade because that
concealer is beautiful so if you're
about an NC 20 and Mac or above that
shade of concealer could work for you
can obviously peeled off my lashes but
eyeshadow has totally held up looks
exactly the same to me
so I hope you guys like this video if
you found it helpful make sure to give
this a thumbs up I mean so hop in
art and get ready and take off my
leopard on leopard right now Tyrol love
you guys thanks for watching see my next
