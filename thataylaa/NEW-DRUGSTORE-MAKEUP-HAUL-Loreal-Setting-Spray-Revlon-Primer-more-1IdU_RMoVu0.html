have a drugstore makeup haul spin a
weird day I'm supposed to be in San
Francisco right now I just got back from
the airport and did some retail therapy
afterwards it's been a weird day so I
stopped at bartels which is a drugstore
if you live in Washington this Bartel is
outside of Washington I don't know they
have a ton of new stuff at the
drugstore right now I'm super excited to
share with you guys I didn't get too
many things but the things I got i am
super stoked about alright let's just do
this this is it really loud so I'm just
going to show you guys what I got I
literally just got home so I haven't
tried any of this stuff out yet they had
a bunch of new makeup which was awesome
I think a lot of brands are coming out
with some new stuff for the holidays I'm
all about like the holiday gift sets and
stuff does anyone just buy those for
themselves the best part about quality
makeup what was that I literally think a
bird just fell from the sky alright
let's just jump into it I'm super
excited I found this stuff this is the
l'oreal infallible pro spray makeup
setting spray this is the first
drugstore makeup setting spray I'm so
freaking excited to try this you guys
know I'm all about the skin Danai via
urban decay makeup setting sprays I use
them every single day and I can't live
without them this retailed for $16 they
do have it for $12.99 right now out
Bartels
I feel like 16.99 is pretty pricey this
has 3.4 fluid ounces I don't know I feel
like that's kind of ridiculous for a
spray from the drugstore
it obviously is cheaper than the urban
decay and Scandinavia stuff you're like
$12 should be like the permanent price
anyone else agree I almost missed this
stuff because it was sitting on like the
bottom most bottom of shelves like
collecting dust
I don't think Bartels realizes the
significance of the first drugstore
makeup setting spray so then I got the
Revlon Photoready bomb and this is a
primer and
anti-shine clear bomb thing this
packaging is really interesting to me
because it's like let me just open this
I saw Holly eats lipstick talked about
this obviously I had to buy it this is
something that normally wouldn't appeal
to me
covergirl came out the product similar
to this I want to say like at least a
year ago now and I wasn't a huge fan of
that Holly mentions it gotta buy it so
here's what it looks like this is just
as I just dug my nail into the balm
thinking it was a sponge the rough day
you feels nice alright now that I just
took a chunk out of my balm so this is
all sponge this is all balm this
packaging is kind of really close to me
like why do I need this giant rectangle
when the product is actually half of the
size you know I'm saying but it feels
like supersoft then just totally like
disappears into your skin it doesn't
feel greasy or oily at all I can see how
this would be an oil controlling product
I'm super excited to wear this stuff and
I hope doesn't break me out actually
didn't get that much stuff I think I
just wanted to like sit down and talk to
you guys somebody needs some shampoo I
don't know why I picked this up this is
the swab track this is a swag split and
rescue I don't know I didn't want to
spend like five dollars on shampoo swab
actually really like the suave
professionals line if you haven't tried
it it's pretty decent quality for the
price and the smell is what got me on
this I don't even know what the heck
this smells like but it smells so good
then I got some hair color I've never
seen this I've never tried this this is
the Clairol expert collection in black
they have Pantene all over this and I am
a big fan of Pantene so I wanted to give
this a try I don't know I just associate
Pantene with like really shiny
nice hair this might be one of those
dyes that gives you that nice well I'm
trying to say just makes your hair look
good and healthy this was on sale for $6
I think it's normally 9 or 10 alright
then I got a couple really random things
I'm super super excited about this I'm
just strolling through the Christmas
aisle because I know I'm never gonna buy
any of the Christmas but you better
look anyways I actually really want to
decorate my apartment but you've been
like a couple weeks and I'm gone for
like the rest of December so there's not
really that's not my point
also I don't want to have another repeat
last year where I leave my Christmas
tree up until May anyways
wow this is like this video it's all
over the place lipstick on teeth okay I
am super excited about these lights
these are mercury silver lights I don't
know if the camera is really picking it
up but they are like awesome they look
like vintage mirrors to me the only
thing I didn't like is that there's a
green wire I saw on someone's blog
actually spray-painted the wire a
certain color so I think I'm gonna
spray-paint the wire white I'm thinking
about hanging them in the background do
you get what do you guys think I'm just
like I need something going on besides
the wallpaper half decorated this room
and then just kind of quit my issue with
this wall is that it's tan and I cannot
stand tan walls would you like put the
wallpaper up over here for the
background of my videos but I don't know
I'm just obsessed with these and I think
once I spray paint the wire they're
gonna look a lot better what a cool idea
also these are on sale for $12 and
they're originally 18 or 19 so the last
thing I got this is super random this is
technically an index card case I got
this because if you've been following my
Instagram you know I've been kind of
going through a crazy scrapbooking
Filofax addiction it's intense
I got the project life cards if you're
into like planner stuff then you know
what those are but they're basically
these cards and I feel like they would
fit perfectly in here right now I just
have them in a ziplock bags I have
nowhere to store them so yeah I just got
that for this this for that that's
everything
like I said didn't get too much stuff I
just wanted to sit down and talk to you
guys because I miss you guys if you like
this video and you like hauls be sure to
give it a rinse a truck every five
seconds if you like this video and you
want to see more hauls be sure to give
it a thumbs up so I know love you guys
thanks for watching and see you my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
