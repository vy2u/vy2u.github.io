will watch making a murderer instead
alright so today we have a shadow inch
moves splash whatever this is on look
I'm wearing right now
I was just sitting on my couch watching
youtube videos it's like 11:00 p.m. at
night right now and I was feeling super
motivated and super inspired to put
makeup on my face so that's what we did
I wanted to do kind of a smoked out look
with brown eyeliner which I rarely use
all the products I used on my eyes are
super affordable if they're not from the
drugstore the color pop which you can
get online and they're like five dollars
my face is like a full coverage kind of
acne covered situation so if you do
struggle with acne and you're pale this
one's for you I'm in this weird cycle
right now where when I had the three
weeks off between my new job and my old
job I basically got like tons of videos
filmed and edited so all of the videos
you're seeing are kind of like a couple
weeks from the past something right away
yeah from the past so if you want to
stay up-to-date with my current day self
make sure you're following me on all my
social channels Instagram snapchat and
Twitter and I am starting to post on
Facebook now which is exciting I didn't
use Facebook for like years I mostly
post a bunch of like makeup deals like
what's on sale and what products I think
you should try out on my Facebook page
so if you're curious you can go like it
the link is in the description box every
single video so if you want to see how I
got this look you're in the right place
just keep watching all right I'm like
very excited to film right now I'm just
in one of those moods feeling inspired
let's do this so they're going to try a
different technique today I never really
tape off my eyes to create that sharp
shadow shadow shields kind of look so
we're going to try that today I also
usually apply my foundation first every
single time so this is going to be new I
want to play a tiny bit farther out this
we can create that illusion of having a
bigger eye than we do I just feel like
playing around today it's like 11 p.m.
right now on a Friday night what I do on
my Friday nights this video probably
won't be up for a few weeks because I
have a bunch of videos ready to go for
the next few weeks but in real time it's
the first week in January
I'm filming this and I just had my first
week of work at the new job so far so
good I'm just like super exhausted that
first week is always so mentally
exhausting priming eyes with Mac's
painterly paint-pot or no soft ochre so
March we're gonna start out by going in
with the master contour kit and I'm
gonna use a shade right here for the
crease I think I'm going to be using all
like affordable products on the eyes
we're starting out with this bad boy I'm
just blending this all over in the
crease area feels weird during my eye
shadow before my browser on so covergirl
just released a covergirl true naked
roses palette or not just when you're
watching this but in real life time
fitted this is actually beautiful
I've only swatch these so far but so far
so good I might do a whole comparison of
this in the Naked 3 palette let me know
if you guys want to see that it's easily
this is weird the mic cord is hanging in
front of the lens in real life but you
can't see it on the viewfinder whoa I
want to do a you know like a purpley
Brown really smoked out kind of look I
want to use brown liner which I never
really do seeing what happens
taking this shade right here and we're
just going to put this on the outer
third I'm just using that same fluffy
brush all the brushes I'm using will be
linked down below but this is the
Citarum ICV 13 whatever is left over on
that brush I'm just blending into the
crease a little bit more okay next I'm
going to take my Coastal Scents BR 250
this is like my new favorite it's 250 or
it was on sale for 250 when I went Cydia
is up - super soft so most of that
they're so scratchy mine is like super
soft I don't know if they remade these
to make them softer or what Bing 250
this thing is freaking bomb so I'm going
to take this darker brown shade right
here start blending this on the very
outer portion
so far these shadows are blending out
really easily I'm going to focus most of
the darker shades on the outer portion
this time usually I like bring them in
and do that a little kind of look but I
think we're just going to do like a
really nice romantic pinky Brown kind of
eye
oh maybe you'll see this and post it for
Valentine's Day no that's like too much
advance thinking not gonna lie so far
liking this whole tape situation you
like don't have to worry about where
your shadow is actually going so I'm
just making sure these are super blended
okay then I'm gonna take my finger and
go in with the which one are we gonna do
let's start out with this light
champagne color first ooh that is
buttery I'm just gonna put oh yeah that
is pretty I'm just putting that on the
lid I always like to use my finger for
lid colors unless I'm doing like a wet
situation go back in with my blending
brush blend that darker shade into the
light shade again when you go with that
same shimmery light champagne kind of
shade and wet my brush this time and see
if we can just get a little more intense
shimmer going this is so pretty I hope
this is picking up on camera oh man
would be a good like wedding makeup
palette flips that videos still coming I
think I mentioned like months ago I'm
going to do a wedding makeup I'm waiting
till it gets closer to wedding season
today I'm going to be doing a drugstore
wedding makeup video also shout out to
Kendall Rae he's getting married in June
I'm like 99.9% sure I'm we going to her
wedding so that's super exciting I hope
she's looking at me saying this right
now debating what I want to do my
foundation right now or the liner for
slow the tape is still on my whole issue
with doing eyes first is that then when
I put on my foundation after can't get
like close enough to my shadow without
puffing it up we're going to try a new
liner first yeah just because I'm using
a gel liner today and gel liner is not
my strong suit so we're gonna go with
this color pop liner this is in the
shade call me have I use any of
colourpop's gel liners before so I'm
just going against that line numbers
creating kind of a diamond shape right
here
oh that's well you live definitely used
the purple color pop liner before the
bride egg makeup tutorial except when I
went over it it started crumbling and
that's kind of what's happening right
now this liner does not build very well
I'm going to bring this a tiny bit into
the other corner getting super close to
my lash line by the way the brush I'm
using is the Sigma winged liner eo6
brush I'm not really recommending this
because I haven't used gel liner enough
to know if this a good brush great or
not but this is just what I have yeah
not a huge fan of the liner honestly I'm
slightly bringing this down on the lower
lash line we're going to be blending
shadows on top of this but just to get
some color down while we have that tape
on okay I think now is the time when we
say bye to the tape where is the catch
of this oh look at that line gotta love
it
okay let's see if we can get foundation
on without messing it up then we're
obviously going to go back to the eyes
and do lashes and blend the shadow on
the bottom and all that good stuff just
breaking my new camera it's all good so
for foundation I'm gonna be using two
products that I haven't talked a whole
lot about but I have had for a while now
this is the cover of X custom cover
drops and this is the Lancome Lancome
depending how fancy you want to get tint
idol ultra 24-hour makeup actually use
this so long ago that I don't remember
what I think about this so it'll be kind
of a refresher I think I didn't like
this like super madness of it at one
point when I start trying this out again
I will do a full review on it if it's
something you guys want to see a lot of
people have been asking for you on the
custom cover drops so I will be doing
that but I just want to show you guys
both these products in this video so I'm
just going to mix these two on the back
of the palette I just use a bath &amp;amp;
Bodyworks candle you definitely want to
shake the custom cover drops before
using them shade n 10 is actually pretty
good for me and the Lancome shade is
actually pretty light so we don't need a
whole lot of lightening or anything like
that I love the coverage of the custom
covered
UPS give and the finish it gives it
really nice like almost do we finished
like just really healthy-looking I think
they might break me out not entirely
sure and I was wearing them a lot
previously I was trying out a bunch of
other stuff at the same time so I
couldn't really tell which products is
breaking me out but I'm just going to go
in this is the Sigma f80 oldie but a
goodie foundation brush not going to get
too close to the shadow because you can
do that with concealer I really like the
shade at the cover FX drops I feel like
it's a really good pinky but not too
pink shade for my skintone really good
coverage obviously oh shoot I always
forget to do before and afters looking a
little scary but I'll welcome together
I cannot stand doing brows before
foundation I don't know how people do
that and don't manage to like cover
their entire brow in product is looking
a tad light once we have our bronzer and
blush and everything on it'll look
totally normal I do have a lot of
product left so just going to go over
and get completely full coverage on some
of the spots typically the Lancome
foundation on its own is pretty matte
but with the cover of extra off so it
definitely gives the foundation like a
satiny henan finish it going in with
concealer favourite naked skin concealer
this is great if you have pale skin it's
light enough and this brush is what I've
been actually using to apply concealer
lately it's super small if you can see
the size super compact so it doesn't
take away from the coverage that's my
main issue with using anything other
than my finger to apply concealer is
that I feel like it just takes away from
the coverage majorly this brush doesn't
do that so that's cool and blend away I
like to pack this in rather than like
blending not bad not bad
I miss at the under eye with my
Physicians Formula powder and I've
actually been using this elf brush
lately to set it and I actually really
like it it's the perfect amount
stiffness really seals in that concealer
you know I'm saying kind I want a dewy
base when I leave the forehead like that
all right I'm going to do brows and we
will be right back okay so we're going
to finish up the eyeballs so I go back
into that color pop liner kind of clean
up that upper lash line and then also
just blend this on the bottom lash line
not bringing this too far in just on the
very very outer third part think when
going with this color pop shade party
time it's like a purpley Brown - like
all crumbly but we're just going to
blend that brush a lot no we're going to
use this to blend out that liner a
little bit smudge it out I'm kind of
connecting that upper lash line with
this I want it to look super smudgy and
go back in with that bronzer and blend
city color highlighting one I think this
is technically for your face that I'm
gonna use it for the inner corner
because why not
looks like a really nice shimmery pink
gum shade but it's on the bottom lash
line and then bringing it into the inner
corner not super intense but it'll do
when I apply this light shimmery pink
shade to the waterline and spide Milani
I'm gonna pop a thin coat of mascara on
and then we're going to put falsies on
before we put it falsies on I feel like
we need a little bit more Brown so I'm
trying to take their liner version of
that same sure - thank you
okay I definitely like that a lot better
than their cream version not a fan of
the cream liner I'm applying my kiss me
0-3 lashes you can get these off eBay if
they're ever in stock I can never find
them anymore what did I just do so I
just put on false lashes I just frickin
love these I feel like these are the
perfect lash like if I could describe my
perfect lash in one lash it would be
these you can't get inside the drugstore
but you can get them on eBay and are
super cheap oh my body washes is wet
wild make length so going in with
bronzer I feel I need to warm up the
face of it so I'm gonna go with my body
strap actually as long as the Maybelline
one I'm gonna go with this shade right
here and I did a whole review on this
palette so I will link it in the
description box below so you can go
watch that foundation is definitely
fully set this is blending really well
on top of it for highlighting women take
Oprah cosmetics you glow girl this is
such a pretty pale pink shimmery
highlight and favorite highlight brush
lightly Sigma f o3 we're just gonna
place this on the top of the cheekbone
the tiny bit of this on my nose and keep
this bow okay not a tiny bit we're going
to highlight town right now mm-hmm
blush might as well use the blush in
here right I love this blush shade I've
been using this almost every single day
so pretty
blends out easily okay now that we're
not looking super dead they grew and
tried the elf matte lip color in T rose
this is a super pretty
Bobby pink shade remember I go back and
edit I'm like completely out of frame
carve out full right when I was doing my
lips but we have the lipstick on I
really like the shade I feel like it's a
really nice muted kind of purpley pink
mauve tone so this is the final look if
you guys like this video give it a
thumbs up so I know helps me out when
you give it a thumbs up I know down
below what looks you guys want to see
next and what products you want me to
try out I think that's everything I feel
