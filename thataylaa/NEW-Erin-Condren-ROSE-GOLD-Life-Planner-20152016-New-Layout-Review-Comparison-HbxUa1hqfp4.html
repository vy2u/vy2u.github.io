kind of like a new book you know what I
mean doesn't smell like a new boy all
right so I am super excited for today's
video one because I feel like I haven't
sat down and filmed in for freaking ever
I filmed like a mini update in an
upcoming video but I think this video
will actually be up first
but basically I'm moving apartments
again so I basically have like four days
to pack everything up so that's fun this
got home from work wasn't planning on
filming and then saw an Erin Condren
package at my door so today's video is
going to be a review and just chat about
the brand-new rose-gold 2015-2016 erin
condren I do have my old planner right
here so I'll be kind of comparing the
two and letting you guys know if I think
this new one is worth it I will be
giving away three $75 gift cards to Erin
Condren so three of you guys will be
able to win your own rose gold planner
all of the info for how you can win will
be listed down below I just tried to say
that sentence literally four times I
don't know where this bruise came from I
was super freaking excited when I saw
that Erin Condren was coming out with a
rose gold planner because hilly Rose
cool doesn't even need an explanation
it's not just the coil and the cover
that's new though there are new options
for the inside for the actual planner
pages so I'm just gonna be going over
the changes and new stuff in this bad
boy and also showing you guys a little
bit of my old planner so on the erin
condren website it says that the rose
gold is limited edition they sold out in
the first week of the rose gold planners
so I have a feeling they're either gonna
make it permanent or continue it for a
little bit longer they do retail for $75
which is pretty freakin pricey for a
planner before we dive into this I'm
just gonna give you guys a tiny bit of
background on my winter background erin
condren
was my first planner I know a lot of
people kind of go from Erin Condren as
their first planner and then going to
Filofax and go into all sorts of things
I got a feel of X and I just wasn't that
into it I just like the feel and
everything of the Erin Condren there are
definitely some cons in this planner and
I think that they actually did a really
awesome job in this version fixing some
of them after I got my first and Condren
I
just got hooked in the planner community
I got really into decorating my Erin
Condren I got super into like following
the Facebook groups I'll link something
down below which are my favorite it's a
really fun community and it really is
like a super supportive creative
community probably over the last couple
months I haven't been decorating my Erin
Condren nearly as much as I used to
mostly because I just don't have the
time anymore it used to be like really
therapeutic to me to just put on music
and go to town with the washing tape and
like do my thing I just literally don't
have the time anymore so I haven't been
decorating it but I will show you guys a
couple of my old pages the 2015 planner
has the vertical page layout and that
was the only option that you could have
in this planner the boxes were basically
split up into morning day night I kind
of just wrote whatever wherever I have
my first subscriber mail right here
which is really cool this was one of the
months where I just kind of like went to
town with the decorating like I don't do
this anymore at all just so you can
see the months the months are a two page
layout and they're basically just normal
tiny calendar box kind of months if
you're new to the Erin Condren world the
covers on here are removable so this was
actually a custom-made cover obviously
that I made I do have a tutorial on my
blog on how I made this if you want to
make your own cover and you want it to
look something like this or you just
want this kind of like square layout
I'll link it down below so you can check
it out I am going to be putting my old
cover and my old back on my new cover
this is just a standard cover that it
comes with it just says a quote you guys
can read that or can you it might be
backwards and on the back is this like
rose gold Chevron actually really like
the back of this I wish that they made a
white and gold
Chevron they feel about the same weight
but the coils on the new rose gold
version are a heck of a lot bigger if
you guys can see that that's kind of a
strange angle they look to me like
they're double the size I love the feel
of a new planner it's kind of like a new
book you know what I mean it doesn't
smell like a new book all right so let's
just dig in to this one this planner is
$75 I can't remember if I already said
that if you're just kind of starting in
the planner world and you don't know if
you want to spend $75 on a planner I
totally get that I think that Erin
Condren is great for certain things but
if you just want something to kind of
like write down basic ideas and you want
like a small thing
thrown your purse kind of up to you with
Erin Condren are pretty big I usually
just keep this at my desk sugar paper I
think it's called sugar paper sugar and
paper they make really cute planners and
you can buy them at Target for like 15
bucks around there but we're talking
about the Erin Condren today so when you
open it up they have this really nice
overlay of rose gold and white the
overall look of this new cleaner is a
lot more clean and a lot more sleek part
of the thing I hated about the old
planner was all of the crap like there's
so much word art and quotes and
that just doesn't need to be in here the
page colors in the old one are like
super bright and cheerful like I don't
need that quote fine and the old cleaner
is also just really bubbly actually
ripped out a few of the pages that used
to be in here but like I just really
dislike this first page in here but it
has the calendar on the other side the
new rose gold one has a lot sleeker
designs you have one tiny page like this
and then it goes into the calendar
months different handwriting it's
cursive this page almost looks like it
could be like your little monthly quotes
or something either things you want to
achieve or a little like monthly goals
up to interpretation I think the other
thing I really like is I have these
really nice watercolor pages throughout
the entire thing watercolor is also
super in right now so I thought they did
a good job there then here's the first
month so you can see the colors are a
lot more toned down and the font is
better in this one in my opinion then
the thing I really like the 2015-2016
planners you have the option to have a
horizontal daily layout which i think is
amazing you literally have so much more
room for each day it's really hard to
fit everything you want to say in a tiny
little box again August watercolor page
all of the colors in here are like
pastel tone down I like how the quotes
aren't like obnoxiously huge they're
just small on each page they have a good
decent amount of blank pages at the end
after all the months just line paper and
then they also have some graph paper
back here I don't think there's graph
paper in the other note section and the
old version there's just blank paper
instead of graph paper with like hideous
designs at the top seashells and
noxious ly colored flowers and things
this one just has simple graph paper
which I like the stickers are also a lot
more toned down to go along with the
rest of the theme as you can see here's
the two compared this one also has a
voted sticker or vote sticker which I
thought was really cool smart thinkin
and then you have the little pocket
folder thing not a huge fan of the
colors of this I feel like they should
have done something with rose gold or
like the purple to match the outside or
blue or something it does feel like it's
on a lot thicker paper than the old I
mean they did upgrade style wise as you
can see again they have a little pocket
with some stickers and cards and stuff
and this is just the typical ziplock
package that you can put packet pocket
and then we are to the back cover I'm
actually gonna put my old cover on right
now just so we can see what it looks
like alright so here's what it looks
like with my cover on I'm freakin
obsessed with it this is like the
perfect combination to me new black
white and rose gold you can ask for more
in life do I think it's worth it I think
it totally depends on your preference
and what you're looking for in a planner
I think I'm gonna be much happier with
the horizontal layout in this version
personally I am in love with this and I
am very happy right now can I sleep with
you if you're new to my channel welcome
I do have a couple other planning
related videos linked the ones I've done
it down below I did do an unboxing of my
original Erin Condren if you like this
video and you want to see more planner
videos give it a thumbs up so I know
we're turning a new leaf</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
