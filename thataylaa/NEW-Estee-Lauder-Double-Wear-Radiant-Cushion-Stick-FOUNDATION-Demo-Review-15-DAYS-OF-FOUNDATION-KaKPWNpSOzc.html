of foundation if you are new here this
is where we're trying out a new
foundation every single day for 15 days
and I just forgot to breathe
there are only two more days left and 15
days of foundation I'm going to like to
play this down below but you can go
watch all the videos up to now I'm
grating all of them 1 to 15 at the end
in a separate video so make sure you
subscribe
soon Salamah but today we're trying out
the brand new estee lauder double wear
nude cushion stick radiant make up quite
the name so Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation has been out for a while now
like years this is kind of a cult
favorite if you like full coverage
foundation for me personally I don't
like wearing this by itself is a little
bit too heavy for me and it just looks
kind of cakey and a little bit too matte
on my skin's so whenever I wear this
foundation I typically mix something in
with it the shape that I first purchased
and I've been using is one c1 cool bone
this is actually a published shades too
dark for me I recently went on the hunt
to find shade 1 c0 which I had to order
off of ebay
for way too much because they don't sell
the shade in the u.s. anymore
I believe you can still get this in the
UK the double air cushion make up the
lowest that this goes in the u.s. is one
c1 cool bone I'm going to search some
swatches here comparing these three
shades along with other foundations that
I own
ok swatch time so this is the Estee
Lauder cushion stick in 1 c1 this is
double wear and 1 C 1 this is double
wear and 1 C 0 I do feel like these two
are definitely closer even though these
two are both 1 c1 look at how much
darker that one is this is Lancome teint
Idole ultra in the lightest shade
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless 110
and this is the golden rose stick
foundation that we did a review on so
it's kind of interesting that this
cushion stick is still called Double
Wear because reading some of the claims
which we'll do right now it doesn't
really sound anything like the original
double wear formula it comes in 21
shades on Sephora's website and retails
for 39 50 but here's the here's the
catch the double wear retails for $38 on
Sephora this one
for 3950 you get half the amount of
product in this the stick has 0.47 fluid
ounces of product and the double wear
foundation has one fluid ounce of
product so you're basically paying the
same amount getting half the amount of
product so that's really interesting I
feel like if someone just walked in the
store and bought this they would
probably think they were paying the same
price but if you actually look at the
amount of products you're getting it's
kind of ripoff so sweet some of the
claims on Lauren's website says it's a
eight hour wear liquid makeup and pro
tool in one so basically this thing has
a sponge applicator tip which you'll see
my thoughts on that in the demo polishes
and even skin tone for a healthy looking
glow the skin loving weightless and
comfortable formula instantly hydrates
and innovative stick combines liquid
makeup in an applicator in one if this
is innovative I'm worried for our future
the thing that kind of throws me off
about this is on Estee Lauder's website
it says this is supposed to be shared to
medium coverage this is a full coverage
foundation I'm not really sure why
they're putting these two in the same
family I think it would have been
awesome if they just came out with a
radiant version of the double we're
still with full coverage still same
bottle it just seems like they kind of
tried to go a little too far with this
one the double wear original foundation
also says that it has a 15 hour lasting
power this one is only eight hour
lasting power if you're new to my
channel I have combination skin with
cystic acne I usually get a little bit
oily throughout the day on my t-zone I
like a fuller coverage foundation to
cover ups on my acne scarring and active
acne yeah I like burritos so I pretty
much need you to know about me what she
noticed a huge blister on my heel if you
guys liked this video at any point and
are excited about 15 days of foundation
don't forget to give it a thumbs up if
you want to see my thoughts on this
foundation and how it applies and where
it's throughout the day you're in the
right place just keep watching
all right ladies
anja so I'm going to start by priming my
face half of my face with the Laura
Mercier foundation primer so just prime
the right side of my face I'm use their
applicator on one side and then a brush
on the other side this is really
interesting packaging kind of minds we
have the Clinique chubby foundation Stix
online it says that you can take this
sponge tip off to wash it I'm gonna see
if you can take this okay it doesn't
look like you can actually take the full
contraption off to just get the product
out yeah it's like on there so mean it
looks like you do have to use this
applicator so obviously has this tiny
little hole where you twist up the
product or push Plus here we go well
okay just came out of there okay it says
touch on using a gentle tapping motion
dot foundation onto skin where needed
buff with circular motions smoothing out
foundation dots blend using light
strokes to blend across skin okay so
whoa Don buff I'm just going to start
with that well this feels interesting I
don't know how you're supposed to buff
out your whole face with this tiny
sponge seems like a waste of time to me
with this applicator it doesn't look
like that high of coverage weird smell
this applicator just seems like
counterproductive to me it's just too
tiny and too hard to actually blend I'm
going to twist this and switch to trying
out a brush for my forehead and then we
might try the sponge too I guess you
would still have to wash the sponge if
you're just dotting it on your face so I
don't know it might be easier to just
twist it onto a palette and then dip
your brush in so far it is not looking
like a whole lot of coverage which is
interesting because the double wear is
like full full coverage
brushes definitely 50 times faster and
coverage I definitely got better
coverage with the brush shade so far
looks okay hoping this doesn't oxidize
because the deployer does oxidize on me
finish is really nice it's like a dewy
radiant finish so let's go in for a
second layer I'm going to twist some
more and Deb I'm hoping that this is
buildable because so far not in the kind
of coverage that I really like oh should
we try the sponge people try spun oh my
gosh I gotta say I do like the finish of
this one a lot better than the double
we're just personal preference for me it
doesn't look nearly as heavy or cakey
which is one of the things that I really
don't like about double wear on my skin
it looks pretty heavy I almost always
mix double wear with something because
it just looks you cakey on me I'm going
to try the sponge for the second layer
on this side to see how it blends and I
am using quite a bit of product
considering we only get half a fluid
ounce in here oh I kinda like how it
looks with the sponge I mean both this
side and this side look pretty much the
same at this point but I like how it
burns out with the sponge with one layer
it looked about light to medium coverage
to me but two layers you can get it to a
high medium coverage definitely still
not full coverage but it looks very nice
and natural on the skin the way it's
sitting so before I apply you can see
learn everything I'm going to show you
guys a close-up so luminous finish for
sure I'm hoping it sets because I don't
really want to set this with the powder
here's what the forehead looks like so
it's 933 right now I'm going to play the
rest of my makeup and I'll be right back
alright so it's now 10 o'clock the rest
of my makeup is on it was feeling a
little feisty with the lipstick this is
colour-pop koala this is not what I
would name this shade got the neon shirt
on neon lips had to do it so I did end
up setting only my cheek area
with the laura geller balance and
brighten powder just so i could blend
out my blush and bronzer and stuff on
top of it and blend it out easily I
didn't set the center of my face at all
because I just want to see how this
holds up since it is supposed to be long
wear foundation it's sitting really
nicely on my skin right now I do look
quite dewy so I'm hoping I don't get too
oily but the powdery literally just
looks like skin on top of this so I'm
just going to be working today it's
Friday thing freaking God so I will
check back throughout the day it's now
3:45 so the Foundation's been on for
almost six hours and for not setting it
with a powder I think it looks pretty
good it looks like it's still fully on
it just looks dewy it's not breaking
down anywhere really tiny bit of
creasing around my nose area I'll show
you guys it close up it is breaking down
a tiny bit around here can you guys see
that but that's kind of typical for me
I'm not getting mouth Lauren's at least
so the final check and I'll do in
natural Lighting's I'm just going to
keep it on for probably or no a few more
hours I need to go eat it's four o'clock
and I haven't eaten lunch yet I've been
working all day so I'm going to go grab
a bite to eat and then we'll film the
final check-in probably hopefully in
natural lighting okay it is 6:30 so the
foundation has been on for about eight
and a half hours I'm squatting right now
and I'm so sore I actually like it it
doesn't like it separating a tiny tiny
tiny bit on my forehead like above my
brow area and then a little bit under my
nose but overall just looking at it I
feel like it looks pretty good after
eight hours okay I'm just gonna need to
blush bronzer highlight is still fully
on I think it looks pretty good after
eight hours coverage wise I definitely
like the original Estee Lauder Double
Wear better but finish and just the way
it sits on my skin I definitely like
this one better
I really wish they made this foundation
just with a little bit more coverage
that would be like the perfect hybrid of
the two
but if you're someone who doesn't need
super full coverage or you just want
something that has a medium coverage for
the summer
it has a nice
nice finish and that isn't going to come
off your face in two hours I do think
this looks nice
I'm definitely going to be keeping this
one mixing it in with different
foundations as the luminosity it just
needs a tiny bit of coverage and a tiny
bit of light lightening so it probably
makes in the hard candy glamoflauge with
this so I'm gonna if you guys would want
to see a whole video about foundation
mixing and like how I choose
combinations and what my favorite
combinations are because I love
foundation mixing it's like one of my
favorite things to do I do it almost
every day I'm not doing today's
foundation my mouth cut off right now
yeah great so tomorrow is day 14 if you
guys like this video and are excited
about 15 days of foundation make sure
you give it a thumbs up two more days
left to share it with your friends do
your thing love you guys thanks for
watching see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
