one freaking bottle of shampoo and come
out forty dollars later and forget the
shampoo that ever happened to you guys
so today I'm going to be doing kind of a
dual first impressions review on the
covergirl
like I have to hiccup there we go true
magic beauty balm skin Perfector and the
covergirl trublend liquid foundation
which has a pump can we just get a
thumbs up for the pump people so as far
as this goes they do have three
different shades have a clear shade of
bronze shade and then a golden like
highlight shade so on the back of this
packaging which I obviously had to
remove because you know I used it in
things says it's oil-free non-greasy
won't clogged pore control shine instant
matte Perfector in an innovative clear
ball this is what I'm using as a primer
right now underneath my makeup and then
the covergirl trublend gap is supposed
to be a kind of skin matching foundation
so looking at this picture they have
three different kind of categories LM
and D light medium dark if you didn't
catch that each category has seven
shades within that um to pick my shade I
basically always go for the one that's
closest to paper
that's how fair I am just pick the
lightest shade I am one ivory story of
my life I picked up both of these a try
day they were on the end display with
like all the other new it is
normally 1199 seriously lawn more
covergirl is 25% off right now at Rite
Aid so I got it for $9.99 and then the
liquid foundation is also normally 1199
and I got it for ten seventy nine which
doesn't make sense if they're both 1199
and they're both 25% off whatever
alright so if you want to see how the
makeup applies and where's throughout
the day and all of that then you're in
the right place just keep watching
don't mind my leopard robe it is like
Antarctica in my room right now
literally ate my so it's kind of weird
right now so I'm looking in this mirror
while I'm filming this part of the video
so deal with it so the skin Perfector
comes with a foam sponge so I guess I'm
going to be using that to apply it it
has this kind of cheap classic covergirl
packaging it feels like a lip gloss when
you first feel it with your finger so I
guess I'm just going to use this with
the sponge and apply it all over my face
as a primer it just feels like waxy
going on and then my face is like
completely soft like feels like baby's
but soft and it says that you can apply
this before and after your foundation so
I'm curious to see how that works like
how does that not rub off your
foundation okay so now when I go over
with a sponge in these spots it feels
super soft my forehead still tiny bit
tacky all the other areas I like yeah
but uh hey so now let's do the
foundation coffee break hold on I'm
really curious to see if this foundation
actually matches to your skin tone we
will see okay so it comes a nice glass
packaging and it has a pump we go crazy
for pumps I'm just going to put
a couple pumps of this on the back of my
hand and it's a pretty thick consistency
right off the bat it doesn't move and
I'm just applying this with a flat top
kabuki brush I got this off of ebay
let's just kind of stipple this onto the
brush let's start here and it's kind of
blend like I normally do alright so
already it comes off way lighter than it
looks on my hand
it's going on super soft super easy to
blend out I look like a ghost right now
but hopefully you'll do its color match
magic got a nice hair coming to the
party I mean it matches my neck like
perfectly I don't know if it's changing
color right now or what's going on on my
face I feel like it is I feel like it
got a little bit darker to match my skin
tone like it doesn't look so ghostly
pale anymore the coverage is pretty good
I would say definitely medium coverage
this half does not have any foundation
on and this half down here does so you
can see the difference I'm just going to
go ahead and do the rest I'm
surprisingly pretty happy with the
coverage of this gives I'm kind of
shocked I just took another half a pump
for my forehead and to run it over the
rest of the areas again it's going on
like extremely smooth I don't know if
that's the primer underneath or that's
how the foundation feels when that's
going on
alright full face is on how different do
I look on a scale of one to ten eleven I
know okay so I did set it with a powder
I use the clear translucent elf High
Definition powder just because I set my
foundation with the powder every day so
why would I do it differently today as
far as the finish goes I do feel like
you can see all of my pores and stuff
and like dry spots more than you usually
can I got like the Sahara Desert going
on over here on my forehead and I'm not
really sure what's going on with this
region it like doesn't know how to deal
with dryness but other than that I like
the finish of it it is definitely more
of a dewy finish it doesn't dry matte at
all which I like I like it do we finish
I think it looks more natural it is 9:36
right now I will be checking back with
you guys in a few hours I need to go I
have a hair appointment so I
out of my hair appointment a sidenote
love it she did a really good job but
literally went through like I felt like
I was in the soap zone in Sea World and
she was washing my hair the water was
like spraying everywhere so you got a
little you know water test it did come
off a little bit on the top but like
overall for being like basically taking
a shower in the hair salon stayed on
pretty well so one thing I noticed is
that my face is so soft like I don't
know if it's the beauty balm
whatever primer oh god this is rough
turning with one hand that was a
horrible Park job so soft I don't know I
don't know I'm confused like it feels
super natural it just feels like skin
and like normally when I touch my face I
can like feel the foundation on it but
this stuff just looks like I mean just
feels like crazy soft it is 127 by the
way so it's been on for about four hours
hours in the salon for three hours took
for freaking ever oh that's it I'm going
to go eat some lunch and then I have to
run a bunch of errands so I'll check
back in a couple hours
bye okay so it is now 448 p.m. I was
editing a video and got super
sidetracked so I forgot to film and
check in but here is the makeup thus far
let's do it an oil test okay maybe a
little bit oily not too bad it still
feels really soft it just doesn't really
feel like I have makeup on my face I'm
kind of like indifferent to it at this
point I want to try and play around with
it more and see if I like it like mixed
into other foundations that I have is I
usually mix my foundations to kind of
create like the perfect foundation so
never really like satisfied or just one
but it's still covering for the most
part I think my blush and bronzer has
faded a little bit and that's usually a
good signifier of a quality foundation
as if your blush and bronzer stay on and
this one I don't think is really helping
that situation but I will check back in
a couple hours and you'll see what's
going on on my face
okay so it is now 9:06 p.m. and I feel
like it has really really broken down a
lot not a fan of all of how it looks
right now it just is like completely
coming off it just looks like really bad
at this point I'm definitely not a long
wearing foundation at all knowing you
just woke up from a nap and you're like
foundation is all patchy and not cute
that's how I feel like it looks right
now and don't think it's going to be my
new go-to foundation but I am gonna try
it mixing it into other foundations and
see how that works so that was my first
impressions video I hope you guys liked
it if you did like always click the
thumbs up button comment down below with
what your thoughts are on on this
foundation if you've tried it because
I'm curious to see how it works for
other people and other skin tones and so
yeah I will talk to you guys later okay
