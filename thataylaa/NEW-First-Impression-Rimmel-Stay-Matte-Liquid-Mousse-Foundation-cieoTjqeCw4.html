the new Rimmel stay matte liquid mousse
foundation I got this at Rite Aid for
$4.99 which is a super good price for a
foundation they have eight shades I am
in zero ten light porcelain obviously
the lightest shade if you couldn't tell
by my complexion over here first I
thought this was going to be too light
but once I put all of my makeup on it
actually blends in really well with the
rest of my skin tone this is a shine
controlling foundation so if you have
oily skin this probably isn't going to
be your foundation of choice but if
you're like me and have normal
combination skin / oily in the summer
time you might like this it has one
fluid ounce of product in here if that
tells you anything so are all my other
drugstore foundations there are also one
fluid ounce and this one is about half
the price which is awesome you want to
see how this foundation applies and
wears throughout the day you're in the
right place
keep watching thumbs up if you like
force impressions videos and I'll see
you guys in a second
too early for this so Rimmel has a stay
matte powder which I really like for
setting my under eye area if I use the
powder all over my face it breaks me out
so I'm really hoping this doesn't break
me out it says it's a silky smooth
formula which leaves a perfectly
perfectly matte baby soft finish
lightweight texture won't feel heavy or
greasy so I did wash moisturize prime my
face I use the L'Oreal Lumi primer if
you are wondering I feel like the
majority of my foundations apply best
with a flat top kabuki so that's what
I'm going to be using for this I'm just
going to put a squeeze of this on the
back of my hand and it's a super thick
consistency it looks like a weird cream
kind of moosie thing so I'm just going
to take my brush don't mind how freaking
dirty it is and stipple this what's just
that whoa feels really thick going on
the skin I think I got too much it looks
pretty dang light it feels like it's
drying really fast I think I definitely
could have gone with a shade darker and
it definitely has pinky undertones like
I think if this was a little bit cooler
tone it would match my neck wall but you
know I do like the coverage it is well
okay I'm going to stop so we can see the
difference between this side and then
this side there's a little bit down here
obviously I actually really like the
coverage and I'm super easy to put on
right now it feels not even sticky just
like it feels like I have makeup on that
doesn't feel sticky it hasn't completely
dried yet I'm going to take the rest
that's on my hand and apply
to the other side since I do like more
full coverage I'm going to take another
squeeze for the rest of my face I like
the way it feels like it feels kind of
like how the Revlon Colorstay whipped
feels when you apply it with a brush
like you can feel that it's there but it
doesn't feel like a liquid if that makes
sense okay the cameras making me look
even more ghostly pale than it does in
real life I think once I add blush and
bronzer and stuff it won't be too
horrible but I like that they have this
fair of a color because that's super
rare for a drugstore foundation usually
the lightest shade is still too dark at
a drugstore it definitely is drying to a
matte finish a legit lip translucent
white on camera but I swear it doesn't
look like that in real life this has
pretty dang good coverage you can still
see some my acne scarring right here but
I think if I put a little bit more on
that spot it would cover it up I like
the finish now it's starting to feel
more of like a powdery finish it feels
like I've already set my face with
powder it doesn't look too horrible on
my dry spots on my forehead I'm actually
very impressed with the coverage I'm
going to go do the rest of my makeup and
I will be back and I know the leopard
robe again guys I've literally been
living in this room okay so the rest of
my face is clearly done did film and eye
tutorial on the look that I'm wearing
right now with the Naked 3 palette it'll
probably be up after this video so be on
the lookout for that I actually think
that this shade is perfect for my skin
tone after I applied the blush bronzer
all that good stuff I did finish with
the elf translucent setting powder only
on my forehead because my foundation
always sets really weird on my forehead
if I don't use a powder it definitely
doesn't
a natural looking finish which most Matt
foundations don't before I like it like
I really like it I hope it doesn't break
me out that's my one concern at this
point why does the lawnmower always go
on right when I decide to film but it is
exactly one o'clock right now during my
day a little late clearly I don't even
know what I'm doing today I have to film
a few videos and then edit and like
clean up the house so nothing super
exciting but I'll be checking back in a
few hours
okay so it is now three o'clock pretty
much so it's been about a couple hours
since I applied the foundation literally
all I've done is ate stir-fried chicken
and film to video I think it looks
pretty much exactly the same as when I
first applied it so that's good I really
like it so far
which kind of shocks me I'm just again
seriously crossing my fingers that I
don't break out so yeah back in the
leopard rope
you know just live in life
so it is six o'clock now I'm still
editing and I am still in my leopard row
the makeup looks the same to me a tiny
bit oily on my forehead nothing major
rest of my face is pretty matte if
you're saying shine right here it's
probably just my highlight I like it so
far I and literally probably going to be
still on this couch when I do my nest
next check-in because I been working so
much that this is my only chance to film
and edit it edit it so I'm just trying
to like pop out a lot of videos for you
guys because I know I've been slacking
lately not really slacking I just
literally haven't had time I feel like
my first impressions just turn into like
vlogs but anyways I'll check back in a
few hours and I'll probably be right
here still okay bye
well look where I am it is now 9:30 to
at night I'm going to take off my makeup
because my eyes are killing me I don't
know if it's this new Maybelline liner
or the Urban Decay shadows but I feel
like I've gotten this from the urban
decay shadows before my eyes just burn
and are like driving me crazy but as far
as makeup goes as far as makeup goes I
moved over here because I feel like it's
better lighting I think it looks really
good it's been on for eight and a half
hours now and my forehead looks great
all my acne scarring is still covered my
blush and bronzer are still like fully
on so I am a fan ten stars for Rimmel
stay matte foundation I'm going to be
keeping it and I'm going to be using it
I'll let you guys know how I like it
mixed in with other foundations like I
usually do don't forget to thumbs up
this video if you like first impressions
videos let me know if you decide to try
it and how you guys like it too so I
will see you in my next video
I
you can stop any day now I don't even
know what he's smiling there's no one
outside take your time really</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
