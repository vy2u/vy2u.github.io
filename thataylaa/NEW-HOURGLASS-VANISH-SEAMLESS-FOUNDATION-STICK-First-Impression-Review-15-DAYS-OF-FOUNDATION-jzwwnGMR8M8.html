days of foundation if you guys are new
here this is where we were trying out a
new foundation every single day for 15
days there's only one day left I am
writing this charcoal bust hardcore
right now but we can do it it is 10:30
in the morning right now and all I want
is hot cheetos in my life i'm gonna like
the playlist down below where you can
watch days 1 through 13 if you missed
any of them but today we're talking
about the hourglass brand new vanish
seamless finished foundation stick I
wasn't originally planning on including
this foundation of 15 days of foundation
but it came in the mail and it literally
almost peed my pants when I open this
box so I have 2 different shades of it
and the brush here that they sent me
we're going to be trying this guy out so
the foundation stick retails for $46 you
only get 0.25 ounces of product in here
just for comparison the cover effects
click foundation that we did you get
0.25 ounces of product as well and that
one retails for $18 so this is pretty
pricy the makeup firmer stick foundation
has 0.44 ounces of product in it
retails for $44 this one is 46 dollars
and you get about half the amount of
product so this is a super pricey
product for what you're getting so just
keep that in mind what I do like is that
it comes in 26 shades which rocks if
your pale princess there are four shades
in the fair category I'm going to show
you guys swatches of these two shades
that I have compared to some of my other
foundations so here's the hourglass
stick foundation in Blanc the neck
straight up is alabaster right here is
the old Tostig foundation we did a
review on this is the golden rose stick
foundation that we also did a review on
this is the make up forevers stick
foundation in the lightest shade here we
have Lancome tin eye dull ultra in the
lightest shade and this is hard candy
glamoflauge so as you can see this
foundation is pretty freakin light this
one actually almost looks lighter than
the hard candy glamoflauge which is
pretty hard to find looking at all these
side-by-side this one actually looks the
most pink toned it makes hard candy
glamoflauge look super yellow I really
appreciate
shade range I wish more products have
this kind of shade range they have three
deep shades in here a bunch of dark
shades a bunch of middle stone shades
and then we have our fair ladies up here
you can get the foundation on line our
glass right now does it supposed to be
available once 4.com starting July 19th
and ends for store is starting July 21st
so reading some of the claims on
Sephora's website says it's a long way
foundation stick with the coverage of a
concealer Lidda t of liquid and
weightlessness of a powder for invisible
full coverage it's infused would double
the amount of pigment versus traditional
foundations for instant full coverage in
one application long wearing waterproof
formula provides 12 hours of coverage
pretty sure we are gonna have a semi
gone for 12 hours today and I might be
going in the water so we'll see if that
waterproof claim is true says it has an
innovative formula that adjusts to your
body temperature so that's pretty much
all of the claims on there as far as the
packaging goes I'm not sure if I'm a fan
of this triangle thing I feel like it's
a little bit awkward to hold and getting
the lid on here you kind of feel like
you're a toddler where you have to stick
those like shapes into a wood thing you
know I do like that it's easy to travel
with if you need to or just throw into
your purse if you like this video at any
point and you're excited about 15 days
of foundation make sure you give it a
thumbs up if you guys want to see how
this foundation applies and wear
throughout the day you're in the right
place
just keep washing up super early with a
migraine I took the pill feeling better
now hence why I can have a huge s light
in front of my face but I feel super
drowsy right now I'm going to prime half
my face with makeup for ever step one
skin equalizer smoothing primer it does
say to use the hourglass one of their
primers but I don't have a so which the
muses primer on right side my face on
one side of my face I'm going to try
their brush this is a vanish seamless
finish foundation brush it retails for
$46 actually feels like a really nice
brushes stiffness kinda reminds me of
the Sigma f80 to then on the other side
I think I'm going to try either the
sponge or this elf brush that they
usually use I kind of want to do the elf
brush so you guys can see if it's worth
it for the brush and if it actually
it's a big difference or not so have the
shays Blanc in alabaster here Blanc is
the lightest shade then it goes
alabaster and porcelain so I'm gonna try
Blanc haven't watched these or anything
if so comes in this triangle shape I'm
not sure how I feel about the triangle
it's kind of awkward to mold I kind of
feel like I have like a pencil it says
apply 2 to 3 dots of vanish to each
section on the base forehead cheeks and
chin so watch their video online ageless
like stamp it three times the buff in
with the brush and tiny circular motions
for the most seamless finish so I'm
going to take wild guess and say that
I'm going to need more than three
triangles but let's try the triangle
method first so okay okay one two three
so I'm going to take their brush on the
right side of my face and start buffing
the brush feels supersoft so I'm
definitely going to need more product in
hundred I'm going to swatch the
auditions because this one actually
looks like it might be a little bit
light okay so it's actually quite a big
difference between alabaster and Blanc
I'm going to take a little bit of
alabaster and I'm actually just going to
apply this how you normally would a
stick foundation like brushes all over
because that did not give me enough
coverage for me alabaster is matching me
a little bit better not totally full
coverage for me yet so I'm at add a
little bit more blending out really
nicely with this brush looks pretty
matte like we've done a ton of stick
foundations in 15 days feels like I
don't have a whole lot on it's kind of
setting does transfer so I'm going to go
ahead and do the other side and try it
with the elf brush for full coverage for
me I obviously have to use more than
three stamps but this is pretty much how
I draw on all of my other stick
foundations to get the kind of coverage
alike whew
you definitely have to buff this one in
it's not like one of those that you want
to like stipple you really want to blend
this one just the finish of this and how
to studying I don't think I'm going to
need a powder with this we show you guys
a close-up in a second but I think these
two sides look pretty much identical I
think you could definitely get away
without buying the $46.00 brush and just
go with this $6 elf brush or whatever
this is three dollars who knows alright
definitely just got that in my rug
awesome the shade is definitely light
enough because I feel like even
alabaster is a tiny bit off anyone's you
have blush and bronzer and everything on
that look more alive this is a little
bit more of a matte finish than I
usually like but it covered really well
prime side versus not prime side I think
looks pretty much the same so right now
it's ten o'clock I'm going to apply the
make up and I'll be right back all right
so it's now ten twelve I just did super
simple makeup because I'm pretty sure
we're just hanging out at the lake today
on my lips right now is Maybelline 7:55
new thrilled with this wet and wild
color icon gloss in Jack yellow mode so
weird
so between the last time you guys saw me
and now it looks totally different to me
I didn't set my face to the powder it
basically looks like it totally warmed
up to my face and it doesn't look matte
at all anymore obviously I have
highlight around here but you've been
looking at my forehead I feel like it
looks like a totally different
foundation for what I personally prefer
I like it better now but I'm hoping that
it stays on and doesn't get oily right
throughout the day yeah it just feels
totally different before you couldn't
really feel it and now kind of feels
like a dewy foundation you know like is
that when I went in to put on my bronzer
and blush and everything it was still
that matte powdery kind of feeling so
it's super easy to blend everything on
top of it as of right now I'm liking how
it looks
everywhere except some of the dry
patches on my forehead is clinging on a
little bit to the acne spots up here and
just find my hairline some of the dry
spots so I'm gonna show you guys a
close-up it's not even showing up on
camera as well but they're definitely
some dry stuff going on around here it
doesn't look bad on the forehead I turn
the ring light way down so you guys can
see better but yeah I just feel like the
finish looks totally different between
now in the last time camera reflects at
the time but we're going to go with
about 10-15 visits now ten twenty six
and I just film intro okay so it is 3:30
- people are sleeping in our living room
right now so I'm attempting to be quiet
but the foundation has been on for five
hours so far and we just went kayaking
so a rage - tell me that the shade of
this table you shouldn't look too light
on my body in natural lighting and I do
kind of agree which is interesting
because I've never in my life had the
second to lightest shade of foundation
be to light so I feel like that's a good
problem to have
both of the shades that I have aren't
going to match me but I'm not super
upset about that because honestly I'm
not not like in this one oily but also
the texture I just feel like is in
that great it looks pretty textured and
kind of cakey in some areas especially
natural lighting for being only five
hours in this claims to be a 12 hour
long wear foundation I just feel like
I'm pretty early right now I just don't
think it looks that great I just feel
like I have other foundations and stick
foundations that are like half the price
that do much better good job so far I
was wearing sunglasses so I have some
sunglass lines right here it's honestly
looking a lot better under the spring
light right now so I took a clip when we
were outside unicycling and things and
as you can see the foundation just looks
pretty horrible I'm just kind of
disappointing sorry the quality's
crappies was shot on my iPhone but I
just wanted you guys to get an idea of
the texture going on and just how bad it
looks basically all right so it is now
8:30 p.m. so sunny she's been on for
almost 10 hours uh not really liking
this one really put this guy to the test
ended up unicycling today juggling
kayaking yeah casual would you saw all
of that if you follow me on snapchat
I was definitely sweating and like
getting a workout and even when I wasn't
like before I needed this went down I
just don't like the way this one looks
you don't see how this is long wear
because it's only been on for 10 hours
and it looks oily I feel like it's
breaking down on my forehead red sheep
in a minute that it didn't look good at
all
clinging to dry patches on my forehead
on the side of my hair of major crow's
feet today I don't know if that's from
the foundation or what but I usually
don't get them that bad under my eyes I
just don't think this one is really
worth it in my opinion I'm trying to
think of a skin type that I think this
would be good on but even on dry skin I
just don't think it looks that great at
the end of the day even five hours after
I applied it when I first checked in
with you guys I just think there's other
more affordable foundations that look
way better if you do majorly struggle
with finding a super super super pale
foundation I think this is the lightest
pink tone foundation I've seen in Blanc
like usually I have a feeling when I
could like the foundation and want to
try it with a different primer or a
powder or something to make it look
better in this one I just don't
have the urge I can't really pinpoint
what it is about it it's just I just
don't think it looks that great overall
this is just a pricey product and I just
don't think it's worth your money I
think you can spend that forty six
dollars in a much better place I will
tell you that place when we do the 15
days of foundation wrap-up where I'm
going to rank all the foundations 1 to
15 tomorrow is day 15 let me know how
you feel about that down below if you
guys like this video and you're excited
for the last day of 15 days of
foundation tomorrow give it a thumbs up
love you guys thanks for watching see
