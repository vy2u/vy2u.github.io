on fire right now from this little thing
thing all right so today it is
foundation Friday this one has been a
long time coming this one you guys have
been asking about since it came out
we're doing it today this is the it
cosmetics confidence in a compact skin
transforming full coverage solid super
serum why does it cosmetics always have
to have mild long names if you're new
I'm going to leave my foundation Friday
playlist down below you can go watch all
of my foundation videos I also do 15
days of foundation on my channel and I'm
going to be announcing the dates of the
next 15 days the foundation when you
guys are saying this in a week or two so
stay tuned I'm probably going to
announce it on social media first before
I announce it in a video so keep an eye
out for that 15 days of foundation
coming back so it's a good Facebook
message isn't it weird how we know
automatically the tunes of different
messages from effect foundations so I
have pretty high hopes for this product
because it cosmetics make some of my
favorite face products the celebration
foundation illumination powder is one of
my favorite powders
I love the CCE illumination cream my
skin reacts really well to cosmetics so
let's go on Ulta and read some of the
claims about this guy this product you
can find on Ulta retails for 38 bucks
and you get 0.63 ounces of product so a
little bit less than the standard liquid
foundation keep in mind this is a solid
serum foundation and it is supposed to
be full coverage so theoretically you
should probably have to use a little bit
less product than a liquid foundation it
comes in seven shades so not great at
all it cosmetics you really need to up
your shade game we need more than seven
shades I the lightest shade fair their
description for a fair says ultra
porcelain fairest of the fair if you're
pale you know that that is quite the
statement to make their deepest shade is
called deep and it says rate reached my
brain feels like mashed potato today
rich too deep skin with warmer tones so
I'm going to search some swatches right
here so you can see how this foundation
compares to some of the other lightest
shades of foundations that I own all
right so swatch time right here is the
cosmedix confidence in a compact I don't
think I would call this fairest of the
fair shade wise right next to it is the
ACOG metics BB cream in the lightest
shade
next over is der McCullough 2:08 then we
have Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless and 110 NARS sheer glow in
Siberia and Urban Decay Naked Foundation
in 0.5 so it says developed by Plastic
Surgeons confidence in a compact is the
first-ever clinically shown anti-aging
solid serum it's infused with full
coverage pigments it has SPF 50 which is
great it delivers all the skincare
benefits of confidence in a cream which
is just there moisturizer
plus your full coverage foundation and
SPF in one simple step it is
groundbreaking technology combined with
collagen hyaluronic acid antioxidants
and ceramide cream so this is supposed
to be good for sensitive skin and on the
box that says for all skin types
ultra lightweight serum foundation for
mess free weightless coverage that feels
like nothing but does everything for
your skin yeah there's a lot of claims
on here if you want to read the whole
thing head over shoulder I'm not going
to read through this it basically sounds
like a miracle so if you guys are
excited for this video and you like
foundation Friday make sure you give
this video a thumbs up if you're new
here you can join the bay radio family
and subscribe I upload Monday Wednesday
Friday at 6 p.m. Pacific time let's jump
into the video if you guys want to see
how be a cosmetics confidence in a
compact applies and wear throughout the
day you're in the right place just keep
watching all right so my phone is
charging but it is 10:30 in the morning
right now I've already washed
moisturized and primed my face I have a
different feel today because they didn't
use my jus a anti blemish matte primer
that one is now totally gone I have five
dozen primers so I'm going to try and
find another primer I like before I
decide if I want to repurchase that one
so today I'm wearing the Smashbox photo
finish foundation primer light my camera
crooked eyes it look crooked I don't
know this one supposed to be for
combination skin which I have I get
pretty oily throughout the day so a lot
of you guys on snapchat said that you
liked this primer so we're going to give
it a go it has a similar kind of feel to
the jouer one it's a bit more like a
lotion but this one totally drives down
and just feels smooth it doesn't leave
like a tacky feel okay so I'm excited
I'm really curious about this one
here's the buck you've already probably
seen it there's a packaging I like it I
like the silver kind of smeared look on
the front and it's just a compact which
is really great for traveling for
throwing in your purse whatever the
packaging of this is
be similar to a Christian Foundation has
this kind of sealant opening that you
just snap shut when you're done so this
does come with a sponge which we are not
going to be using and then it comes with
a sealant to protect the product sing us
in here the heck don't do that out in
the compact it looks pretty dark so I
have their new heavenly skin skin
smoothing complexion brush and we try to
apply it with this as a backup I have my
elf brush here this mi try it with this
brush as well not sure if I want to do a
sponge I normally do one half of my face
with a sponge this is my pure cosmetic
sponge might as well try it maybe we'll
try it on a little portion down here but
I'm going to start out with this brush
and this a cosmetics brush feels hella
soft like I could just sit here and rub
this all over my face it does have an
angle to it a cosmetics brushes are
extremely soft high-quality if you've
never tried them they feel like heaven
on your face so it does it just directly
swirl in here and apply to the face and
this is supposed to be full coverage so
let us swirl that didn't get anything on
the brush I'm going to swirl a little
bit harder there might be kind of a
solid layer on top okay so it looks like
I got a bit more product I think you
kind of have to break the top layer
alright I don't think I got enough okay
let me really swirl in here okay there
we go with this brush it's feeling
pretty thick like hard to blend out not
sick just a little bit stiff blend out
it's not like it's gliding over my skin
or anything I like the shade of it and I
definitely want to try it with the other
brush actually I'm just going to take
the elf brush right now and finish it
off done okay yeah yes I like it better
with the elf brush interesting okay so
on areas where I am kind of going over
it with this brush it's almost taking it
away so I think it's a one kind of go
thing that you probably don't want to
layer this I mean you don't really need
to though because I'm getting really
good coverage on the first layer and try
this elf brush down here on my acne so I
still need to use concealer to cover up
some of my more pigmented acne spots on
my face
full-coverage and it feels really it
feels really lightweight now this
blended out there is like a red patch
right here where I tried to go over it
with the elf brush it kind of just took
away all the product I'm gonna try with
this brush no so if you go over this
with a brush after it's on it kind of
just takes it away so I'm going to just
put a little bit on my finger to try and
add that again so once this is on your
face you don't want to mess with it this
little area right here is looking a
little funky maybe I'll try this again
on a forehead just to make sure I like
the elephant better yeah it's very it
feels to me pretty stiff to blend out I
wouldn't say this glides on services
this is solid serum I kind of had a
feeling this like glide out kind of like
the makeup firmer stick foundation this
one definitely is a bit more difficult
to blend out and it doesn't look like it
goes over any kind of major spots very
well the product really isn't sticking
this is interesting I like how it looks
I like the coverage on the areas of my
face where I don't have this but if you
have any kind of texture not sitting
very well on dry patches up here and it
literally just isn't covering or
sticking to my fist up here I'm going to
try it with the sponge just for the heck
of it on the other side so with this
sponge I'm like just kind of digging in
again hard to blend out I'm going to
actually use my finger to try and blend
it out up here since it's not blending
out super easily maybe we need the
warmth of my fingers to help blend it
out much lighter coverage if you use
your fingers and the sponge I mean this
side we're getting like high light
coverage low medium coverage to the side
definitely better coverage so to finish
off this side I'm going to go back in
with the elf brush I think I like this
the best to apply it and let's hope we
don't get any texture since I'm kind of
going over this a bit once it's actually
blunt what is this hair doing once it's
actually blended out on your face I mean
it looks really nice and smooth on my
cheek area there's not a whole lot of
texture at all it just looks very nice
and
smooth my forehead up here different
story let's try this side trying to
smooth this out it's a sponge bit on my
forehead application not quick at all
you really have to work this into your
skin why am i using my left hand right
now I'm going to get it close and show
you my forehead in kind of this area so
you can really see them right here can
we focus so hopefully you guys can see
this but right here it just literally
did not stick to this or this acne
pretty much any of my acne on my
forehead it just totally kind of
separated from what is going on I do
think it looks nice and smooth on my
cheek areas but again it just really
didn't cover any of my acne I don't know
what's going on at the focus right now
but right here this is that patch I was
talking about where it just doesn't want
to stick to it all you can see like the
redness coming through right there I'm
going to spot conceal these areas to try
and cover them up I don't have major dry
patches anywhere but it does seem to be
emphasizing the ones that I have on my
forehead up here so far hasn't kind of
mixed feelings because I do like how it
looks on the second second half the
bottom half of my face my forehead it
just really doesn't look great so I'm
going to do the rest of my makeup and
I'll be right back feel like this lip
gloss is going to be all over my teeth
in about two seconds oh yeah so
obviously the rest of my makeup is on
what time is it so it is 11 28 so we are
calling the check-in time 11:30 despite
me noting a super big fan of this
foundation right now I like how the rest
of makeup turned out so I'm going to
tell you guys everything that's on my
face in a second but let's talk about
the foundation real quick so I did have
two spot conceal over my acne to cover
them up I spot concealed on the center
of my forehead where that it is over
here down on my chin so the only place I
set my face was just the center of my
forehead and a little bit on my chin
using whatever was left over from my
stargazer powder just after I set my
under eyes so it's not any kind of
powder on the rest of my face so I like
how it looks here down like I said
really don't like how my forehead looks
here's will see a natural lighting in
the next check-in but it looks very
textured on my forehead dry patchy I do
want to say sometimes I get questions
about why I film the intro once the rest
of my makeup is on but it like ruins the
surprise or whatever and that's just the
way I like to film foundation videos
this is a
prime example that in my opinion doesn't
ruin anything because if foundation can
look great on camera under the lights
and everything but the way it looks
tells you nothing about how it applies
what I think of it how much I had to
build it up to get the kind of coverage
I'm at right now all the small details
that you actually hear during the demo
so if anyone asks in the comments from
here on out we can reference this answer
and on the thief again my lips are on
fire because I'm wearing like a plumping
gloss right now I pretty much feel like
putting any kind of product on top of
this foundation it just does not like it
it's like a magnet and opposite what am
I trying to say
what does the analogy I'm trying to make
here they repel each other basically so
when I blended out my blush bronzer in
highlight when I carved out my brows
with concealer any kind of product on
top of this foundation on my skin does
not sit well it kind of just takes away
the foundation on this half of my face
it looks very skin-like my pores don't
look emphasized or anything that I do
like but you know my thoughts on the
rest of it okay let's move on to makeup
on the rest of my face I'm going to
start off with this highlighter because
I am so freakin excited about this you
need to pause this video right now go on
Ulta or jcat wherever you can get it
I'll link it down below and get this
highlighter because what the heck this
is stunning if you have more fair skin
and you like a pinkish kind of tone
highlight I mean what the heck this is
so beautiful this is the you glow girl
baked highlighter in Bella Rose I
believe this is new I feel like this is
going to be my new favorite highlighter
when I want a very intense highlight you
need this in your life so for contour
use the pixie and Mariam palette I tried
out this shade right here for the first
time and it looks pretty dark in the pan
but if you use a light hand I think it
can work blush again in love with this
Max Factor nude mod blush amazing what
did I do so on the eyes for eyeshadow
all I used was this same bronzer palette
is these two shades right here and then
for the glitter I went in with this
Stila magnificent metals liquid
eyeshadow this is new I bought this off
Sephora I only got one shade but I feel
like I need to buy them all now I never
wear glitter because it's such a pain in
the ass to apply and it just gets all
over your face you know the drill but
this is liquid glitter and it is
stunning excited about this to feel like
we have a lot of winds on the rest of my
face eyelashes use my black magic lashes
knock Torah let's say is a new pur
cosmetics liquid lipstick in obey this
has almost the same kind of formula as
the NYX soft matte lip creams I feel
like that they don't totally dry down I
haven't worn one throughout the day yet
so this will be the first time we'll see
you but I also put a gloss over this I
used the new glam glow pump / Aegis
plumper Aegis gloss in casting couch
which is really pretty my lips are on
fire but I like the color of this and I
set my face like usual the past I don't
know months probably I've been using the
Catrice prime and fine multitasking
multi talent fixing spray I thought it
might help to settle tan a texture on my
forehead
and it didn't do a whole lot there but I
am wearing setting spray I always wear
settings right call them the second time
11:30 next reckon I do will be in
natural lighting I will see you guys in
a few hours
alright so it is now 5 o'clock so the
foundation has been on for 5 and a half
hours I am hangry right now I currently
have food in the microwave because I
haven't eaten lunch so we are right in
front of the window let's talk about how
the foundation is looking so I really do
like the shade of it I think the shade
matches me really well overall for not
having on a powder right now when you
get up close it looks a bit dry I still
don't like eye looks on my forehead at
all but now even around
we're down around here looks pretty dry
when you get up close let me zoom you
guys in here it just looks a bit dried
to me and there is where I don't usually
look dry here's my forehead I actually
think is looking better on camera than
it does in real life right now but it's
not majorly kicking up or creasing on my
upper lip or anything looks good from
far away everywhere except my forehead
and I'm not getting super oily or
anything yet so that's good I'm going to
keep this on we're going to shoot for
the full 10 hours bachelors on tonight
I'm stoked and I'll check back in with
you guys at the end of the thing okay so
it is now 11:30 so the foundation has
been on for a full 12 hours this is a
long wear test I started filming in the
other room like you normally do with the
lights and everything but I feel like
you just can't see it the same so I
don't know let me know if you guys like
filming in this kind of lighting or if
you like seeing it under the studio
lights for the last chicken let me know
but
sometimes I feel like you just can't see
what I'm talking about as much 12 hours
for being on for 12 hours
I'm actually not super oily for 12 hours
I'm normally like total greaseball
without a powder look I mean I'm
definitely oily but it's not like
horrendous or anything oily around my
nose area it just doesn't look good on
my skin this one just doesn't work what
I was really noticing see if you can see
in this light I don't know it just looks
really textured and like dried to me
around here my skin just looks dry and
cakey and the forehead doesn't look
super great it's wearing off of my chin
down here I might have had my hand on
that so it did come off down here a bit
and I also feel like it rubbed off
around my nose well I just think 38
bucks this one on my skin this one is a
note for me I'm kind of bummed because I
like the idea of this one a lot a solid
full coverage compact foundation that
sounds great so I'm just kind of buzzing
this one didn't work out since I didn't
like it off of first application like
before it even wore at all I don't know
if I'm going to try this one with a
powder maybe I just I mean it didn't go
on very well so I hope you guys liked
this video if you did make sure you give
it a thumbs up foundation Friday every
Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time I just
finished watching The Bachelor love you
