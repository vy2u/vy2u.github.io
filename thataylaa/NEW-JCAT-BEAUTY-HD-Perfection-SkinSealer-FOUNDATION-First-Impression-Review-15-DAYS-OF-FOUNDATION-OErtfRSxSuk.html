of foundation crazy three more days left
not gonna lie these past few days have
been a little bit brutal but we're in it
to win it if you're new here this is
where we're trying out a new foundation
every single day for 15 days so if you
haven't seen any of the videos from day
one through eleven I'm going to link all
those down below in a playlist called 15
days of foundation today's foundation is
one I haven't seen any reviews on yet
this is the jcat HD perfection skin
sealer foundation and I saw this first
on their Instagram if I can figure out
how to freakin put the Instagram video
right here I will drew in a waterproof
lip liner on their arm put water over
rubbed it didn't come off and then they
completely covered it with the HD skin
sealer foundation so as soon as I saw
that I was like full coverage sign me up
if you're new to my channel I have
combination skin with cystic acne I like
a fuller coverage Foundation and I do
get oily in my t-zone usually so you can
now find Jacob UD at Ulta I don't
believe this is released anywhere except
their website right now I'm guessing
this will probably be on all too soon
since the rest of their line is there so
you can find this online jacob' the
foundation retails for $7.99 which
freaking rocks great price point there
0.85 ounces of product so a little bit
less than normal it comes in 10 shades I
have the shade 101 cool vanilla I also
have the shade 102 air fresh vanilla so
I'm gonna search swatches right now of
these two shades compared to other
foundations that I own I would just like
to say that it is 10 p.m. my night right
now and I'm editing back this footage
and I forgot foundation swatches so we
are doing it right now
all right we made it swatch time right
here is the jcat foundation in 1 zero 1
this is 102
this is Tarte rainforest of the sea
lightest shade this is the Catrice
foundation I did a review on this is the
golden rose stick foundation clearly
quite a bit lighter than most of these
after you all these and this is
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless 110
by the way ignore the eyeliner mark on
my eye
video sorry about that let's read some
of the claims assessing some flawless
full coverage foundation that gives the
skin the most beautiful beautiful that
gives us get the most beautiful natural
finish it is lightweight so it's
undetectable on the skin a long-lasting
foundation that lasts throughout full
day of work well great so that's pretty
much all sets on their website they do
have some nice deeper skin tone shades
if that is you if you guys liked this
video at any point and are excited about
15 these foundation make sure you give
it a thumbs up and again because I'm
still getting questions I am going to be
ranking all the foundations one through
15 at the end of this series I'm making
a best/worst of 15 days foundation
everyone see how this when you turn
applies and wise throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching I'm wearing the smallest bun of
life right now what happens when you
have chocolate flow your hair the camera
literally would have focus on my face it
is 616 a.m. right now so
attempting to be extra quiet so my skin
is pretty bad this morning when I went
to sleep last night I had these two
forming and then I was really bad and
attempted to pop this one so that's
what's happening on face also have a big
one coming on my chin don't know if it
was from last two foundations I used I
don't know but we are up carping the DM
I actually have a meeting with a
potential client this morning which is
why I'm up this early have to film this
prep for that and then later on today I
have my third appointment of Botox for
my migraines when she does it she
usually has to take off like all the
foundation on my forehead so when I have
it on not long enough so that I could
check in before that right so I'm going
to prime half my face to thing with the
makeup forever step 1 hydrating primer
that we use
yesterday and I want to apply this to
right side of my face
Wow these ones are like really out party
today so I'm going to use this brush
works brush on one side of my face and
the morphe sponge on the other side of
my face this is super nice for blending
out foundation just buffs it really
quickly and easily dive the shade 101
cool vanilla in 102 fresh vanilla air
fresh vanilla I'm gonna go with the
latest one I haven't swatches yet so
hopefully this is the right one to go
with nurse Ben Thompson whistling back
my palette from the Instagram video that
I saw this is super full coverage which
is exciting the consistency is super
thick it kinda reminds me on to Milani
two-in-one concealer foundation that I
did a full review on the glow
it smells like soap it looks very gel
like super dewy off of that layer it
looks like about a medium coverage to me
you can still see freckles and stuff
right here and some scarring so this
side I did not get full coverage just do
the sponge side and then go back in for
a second layer
je vais is definitely looks dark next
time I would definitely mix in Manic
Panic or some kind of mixer or a lighter
foundation because this does look too
dark the finish and coverage looks about
the same on both sides to me looks like
a medium coverage so let's go into the
second layer I have two major loop on
this one down the neck since it is too
dark I still don't feel like it's
totally full coverage with that second
layer looks really moisturized and kind
of gel like but I can still see
imperfections coming through at some
acne so I wouldn't call this full
coverage
since this is super Dewey this would be
a good one to probably mix in with like
Estee Lauder Double Wear or Pat Von D
locket
tattoo foundation probably try with the
Kat Von D since that one is way too
light for me the hell 42 and this one is
a pretty dark all right so here's what
looks like up close as you can see it's
super luminous and it's sitting on my
forehead fine it's not clinging to any
dry patches or anything but it
definitely isn't full coverage as you
can see this is still coming through we
have spots right here coming through
this that looks like it has a little
more coverage Jaime is looking very duty
right now this is probably too jewy for
me not to set it and I also feel like I
need to lighten it to match the rest of
my body so I am going to use a setting
powder but I'm going to drink some
coffee apply the rest of my makeup and I
will be right back alright so it sounds
6:45 in the morning rest my makeups on
super basic if you're wondering what I
usually wear it to work it's something
like this except 99% of times without
the liner I feel like since my face is
looking a little dark right now got to
make the eyes good you know so I applied
concealer setting powder under my eyes
and then the Laura Geller balance and
Brighton and porcelain I do feel like I
hope to lighten it a little bit but I
still feel like the color looks
definitely off so if you're pale
princess this one is not light enough
unfortunately but you could try it with
mixer I haven't tried it yet so I'm not
sure how it mixes and everything powder
is sitting really nice on top of it it
still looks really do me you can see the
dew coming through on the forehead and
it doesn't look like I'm wearing really
a powder it doesn't look cakey or
anything upper lip looks good
no complaints right now my eyebrows are
healing right now hence why there's like
the little white parts to it it starts
to scab boom like day five usually and
on my lips right now is the over lip
liner choose this in mauve with Milan
ease matte nude over top when I was
going to an office everyday this
lipstick is what I wore pretty much
every day
so I will be checking back throughout
the day alright so it is now 5:34 p.m.
so then you should have been on for
almost
eleven hours I am so exhausted right now
meeting this morning went really well
neurologist not so much go in for
another MRI yeah I feel like I just self
diagnosed myself every time anyways
let's talk about foundation for being
home for 11 hours color aside I think it
looks pretty good like the finish of it
I'm not as oily as I can be in my t-zone
the thing I like is that it doesn't look
like it's really breaking down on my
skin to me even on my forehead where I'm
Olli I feel like it's still on you know
what I mean it's not bad around my nose
the my bronzers a little big on this
definitely did oxidize and it's
definitely too dark I would not wear
this alone again without mixing in
something with it like it's kind of hard
for me to judge a foundation a hundred
percent when it is too dark for me just
because I feel like since the colors off
it's just hard to know it's hard to like
it but color side just looking at the
finish of it and texture and everything
I think it's pretty dang good for after
eleven hours since it was super gel like
I do think this one it could work if you
have dry skin if you have super oily
skin and I think this is one that you
just have to try out and see how it
works on your own skin not 100% loving
it and not disliking it I wish it was a
little bit more full coverage just
because they say that it's full coverage
this definitely isn't full full coverage
to me is more like a medium to high
medium coverage in my opinion and that's
all my thoughts so if you guys liked
this video and you're excited about 15
days of foundation and give this video a
thumbs up tomorrow is day where are you
whoa today is day 12 tomorrow is day 13
