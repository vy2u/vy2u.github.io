game right now purple and gold alright
so today it is foundation Friday this is
where I try out a new foundation every
single Friday on my channel this is a
brand new foundation by LA Colors it's
called truly matte long wearing high
pigment foundation so you get one point
three five ounces of product in here
which is a little bit more than a
standard fluid ounce and this retails
for only six bucks so super affordable
the shipping was actually more than the
cost to the foundation I think it paid
eight bucks for shipping I don't know
where you can get LA Colors in store let
us know down below if you know but I
just bought this on the actual LA Colors
website so reading on the LA Colors
website all it says is the long wearing
high pigment formula applies as a liquid
and blends to a beautiful matte powder
like finish available in 14 shades to
complement in a wide range of skin tones
I don't know 14 shades complements a
wide range of skin tones but okay so I
have the lightest shade which is
porcelain I'm gonna surf swatches right
here so you can see how porcelain
compares to some other foundation shades
so swatch time right here is the LA
Colors foundation in the lightest shade
porcelain next over is Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless in 110 derma called
2:08 which is my closest shade match
josie maran vibrancy foundation in RG 5
and the milk makeup blur liquid
foundation in fair so that's all the
claims we don't have a lot to work with
here
but LA Colors is cruelty free so is
their parent company which is beauty
twenty one quick announcement if you
missed it in the last vlog that just
went up I am gonna be doing a meet-up in
Washington and Spokane Sunday November
19th 4 o'clock p.m. you can get tickets
down below in the description box 100%
of the proceeds go to project Beauty
share and it's that northern quest
casino in Spokane Wow
I actually did that in one take in like
one sentence check the link down below
if you want to get tickets I can't wait
to meet you guys also wanted to say I
will have reviews coming on the BH
liquid foundation the new one and also
the J essential high coverage cream
foundation this one I picked up the
wrong shade this is way too dark so I
ended up ordering a second shade I'm
waiting for that to come in so these two
will be coming in the next couple weeks
so if you're excited for this video and
you enjoy foundation Friday don't forget
to give this a thumbs up so I know if
you're new here you can join
burrito family and subscribe upload
every Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m.
Pacific time let's get into it and put
this on my face if you want to see what
I think of this foundation how to apply
some oyster out the day you're in the
right place just keep watching
alright so it's actually 1234 right now
so we're getting a late start felt not
so great this morning but we are here
we're here so I'm gonna try and do my
usual 10 hour wear test even though
we're getting a late start today but
it's November 1st when I'm filming this
so I am currently on day 18 of accutane
so this one isn't way pre-recorded
because this is a new foundation that I
wanted to get up for you guys and try
out so I haven't opened or swatched or
anything this shade yet it looks like it
might be nice in the bottle can tilt
this is glass or really hard plastic I
think it's really hard plastic but it
has a nice weight to it doesn't feel
super super cheap so I've washed
moisturized and primed half my face
using a Smashbox primer I just primed
this half of my face because this half
is definitely a bit more dry I'm
starting to get a tiny bit dry from the
accutane mostly down here so I've got a
good moisturizer right now and then also
the primer eyes are on this side so on
half my face I'm gonna tried my Sigma
f80 to apply this and on the other half
I'm gonna use a sponge they actually
discontinued my favorite fergan morphe
sponge ever the other two red ones by
the way are shit don't get them this one
is the only good one but I've actually
been really enjoying this la girl one
it's great so I'm gonna use that today
we have la girl and la colors so I think
I'm gonna start out with the dampened
sponge on this side of my face this when
I squirt it out on the palette looks
pretty thick this is supposed to be
matte and it says high pigment smells
like paint it feels very light which is
weird going on since it was such a thick
consistency yeah it feels pretty thin
with the sponge not covering very well
it's looking like it's covering more on
camera but this looks like low medium
coverage right now at the sponge where I
do my forehead I want to do the brush on
this side to see if I get a little bit
better coverage so I can see what I want
to do with the forehead it's pretty
patchy actually when I look up close on
both sides just doesn't want to stick to
certain areas about the
I'm Dan not crime side and I'm using a
ton of product right now it's just like
eating it up I'm getting a tiny bit
better coverage with the brush side but
the finish is definitely nicer to sponge
so I'm gonna apply this with the brush
and then smooth it out with the sponge
it's like repelling off of my face in
certain areas oh I'm not liking this I
would not call this high pigment at all
I'm getting at best medium coverage it's
not covering my freckles redness really
anything like there's still everything
coming through okay so off of that one
layer looking up close not looking good
even on the areas where my face isn't
super dry or anything yet it just is
emphasizing everything and it's making
my skin look really dry not looking good
folks not looking good see if we can
build it up with a sponge the coverage
aside it just looks bad on my skin also
feel like I've used a shit ton of
product but where is it going
smells like the wet and wild photo focus
foundation I will say it is nice that la
colors came out with a shade like this
because usually their lightest shade is
like orange okay so that's looking
better on the second layer now we're at
medium coverage I don't even know before
I called medium looked like high light
coverage before I think now we're at
medium barely if you have any kind of
texture or dryness on your face I would
say pass on this one for sure still
looks patchy in certain areas and pretty
horrible on dryness this is kind of one
of those where a wear test feels kind of
pointless because I already tell you I
would not recommend this or put this on
my face again again even on the areas
where I'm not super dry it just looks
not great but we're still gonna wear
this thing there's no way I powder my
face with this because it would be a
disaster with the dryness but it is
transferring doesn't feel like a total
powder finish so maybe just needs a few
more minutes to kind of set down so as
1249 let's just call a check-in time
about one o'clock so I'm gonna do the
rest of my makeup and I'll be right back
alright so it's now 1:40 by so my makeup
is on I'm gonna tell you guys what's on
my face in a second but I just took some
footage in
the window think you'll be able to see
what I'm seeing
overall does not look great at all it
just looks horrible on my nose around my
nose my forehead there's just not really
one area of my face that I like how it
looks on right now it's already starting
to actually crease right here I just
noticed this might be one throughout the
day that kind of warms up and looks
better as oils and stuff come through it
has totally set down so now it feels
more like a powder and it doesn't seem
to be transferring as much as it did
before so that's good that it sat down I
think you guys get it I am not feeling
this one at all but on the rest of my
face to bronze I use the bare minerals
invisible bronze I don't think I used a
blush no I didn't really use a blush I
just put that kind of all over my cheeks
I tried out the Physicians Formula
butter highlighter these are new both of
these broke in the mail I first went on
with this one it was a little more
purpley but it looks really pretty I
mean it's like a rosy pink kind of
purple shade and then I layered it with
the white one I feel like I have to try
these again to know my thoughts on them
I just can't really tell right now cuz
my skin just looks like shit so for eyes
I tried out the day Slayer 15d I don't
know if this is gonna be their permanent
packaging I really hope it is but this
is such nice packaging this is like hard
heavy plastic way better than their
normal packaging you guys know I'm into
packaging huge mirror on here without
blinding you oh that's cool woah here's
the shades in here so I mean typical
warm palette but the shadows were
beautiful and then for the metallic
shade on my lid I tried out the color
pop supernova shadow in the shade Walk
of Fame this is beautiful I mean look at
that the only thing with this I realize
is that you don't want to put matte
shadow on top of here so I tried to
blend out my outer-v color on top and it
didn't really work like you can still
see it coming through and it looks kind
of patchy right there so just use this
as like your last step I shadow
inner corners the same Physicians
Formula highlight and then on my lips I
use pure FBF with color pop Ponyland
ultra glossy lip and then I also tapped
a little bit of the pink highlighter
just on top of my lips to give it more
of like a pink purple accountant and I
think that's everything then I just put
on my normal mascaras which will be down
below everything on my face is always
listed down below in the description box
jewelry everything I also got new
Rings switch into gold so again check-in
time is one o'clock next check and I do
will be a natural lighting hopefully if
the Sun is not down by then I will see
you guys in a few hours so it's not 557
so pretty much six o'clock it's been on
for about five hours if this could white
bones that would be great okay the
camera was not wanting to not be blue so
I'm just in my filming room but I just
have one of the lights on so hopefully
you guys can see my face so it's been on
for five hours and it looks pretty much
exactly the same I feel like my bronzer
and stuff which I regularly use that
bronzer and I know how it performs and
right now I feel like it definitely
looks touchier than it usually does so
at least it's not like creasing on my
upper lip so no major changes here or
thoughts I'm going to keep this on for a
few more hours so I'll see you guys at
the end of the night it is 9 o'clock my
phone is dead right now it's charging so
it's been on for about eight hours at
this point and I was just editing this
video and it looks better on camera than
it does in real life in every check-in
especially the last one I feel like in
front of the light so I wanted to do
this one in the bathroom hopefully it's
more accurate but my face is pretty into
right now I don't know if it's something
the foundation or just maybe being on
accutane and something and this one no
idea but I should probably wash off my
face so I guess an upside is that I'm
not oily right now at all like my
forehead has zero oil in it I never have
zero oil still looks Pat cheese I don't
think it looks significantly it works at
this point which is good at least that
hasn't worn worse throughout the day it
just still looks like it did when I
applied it so I think you guys get my
thoughts on this one at this point this
one is a definite no for me maybe if you
like light coverage and have oily skin
you might like this but not feeling it
so well let's go the other way shall we
but I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and found it helpful if you did make
sure you give it a thumbs up I love you
guys thanks for watching see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
