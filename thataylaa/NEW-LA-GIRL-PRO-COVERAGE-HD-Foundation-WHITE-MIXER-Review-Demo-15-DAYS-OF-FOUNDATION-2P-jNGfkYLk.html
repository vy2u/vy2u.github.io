what I would do for some hot cheetos
right now all right so today it is day
10 of 15 days of foundation this is
where I'm doing a new first impression
video every single day for 15 days if
you've missed any of days one through
nine they're all linked down below in a
playlist along with last series you can
go watch it's a good time
so today's foundation is the LA girl Pro
coverage HD long wear illuminating
foundation this is brand spankin new I
found this on Instagram and as soon as I
saw they had a white mixer I ordered
this on IPA house I think it actually
came out on I Kate house before the LA
girl website or anywhere else I'm not
sure if they accidentally put it out
before was supposed to launch but I've
actually had this for a couple weeks now
you guys 0.95 fluid ounces and product
in here so just a tiny bit less than
standard 1 fluid ounce and it's retails
for $7.99 on I Kate House and $10 on the
la cour website so definitely better to
get on I key house site
it also says on the LA girl website that
they're going to be in CVS stores soon I
haven't seen at my CVS but Washington
drugstore is sec so might be at yours so
if you are new here at tons of videos
for people with pale skin one of my
favorite things for pale skin is
foundation mixers foundation mixers can
be awesome for lightening of products
you can basically make any foundation
almost any work unless it's like super
super dark even if you don't have pale
skin and mixers can be awesome if you
have foundations that work for you in
the summer and you want to make them
work for you in the winter when you're a
little bit lighter don't throw away your
foundation don't get a different shade
just use a foundation mixer one of my
favorite mixers that I've talked about
for years is Manic Panic dreamtone I was
one of the first white foundations on
the market in the last year or two years
they had been a freaking popping up me
doing a whole foundation mixer showdown
video coming soon so in the foundation I
have the white shade and then I also
picked up fair and porcelain this comes
in 16 shades including the white mixer
and it does look like it goes pretty
deep and will include swatches of all
three of these compared to some of the
other foundations that I own
alright swatch time so right here is the
white foundation mixer by la girl la
girl foundation okay where you going la
girl Foundation and fair same foundation
in porcelain this is the Bourjois
healthy mix foundation
and 51 which I did a review on yesterday
derma called 2:08 Clinique continuous
coverage creamy glow Oberon Decay all
nighter 0.5 Kat Von D lock-it l 42 and
ex1 1.0 I also wanted to mention that I
put together a blog post of a bunch of
my foundation swatches from videos next
to each other so you can see kind of a
line up of a bunch of foundations I
swatch I'm a link that post down below
so you can see kind of a comparison
between a bunch of different foundations
so I'm on the la girl website let's read
some of the claims about this guy it
says it's a long wear illuminating
liquid foundation ideal for flawless
looking full coverage finish lightweight
formula is comfortable for all-day wear
urban free formula with added
antioxidants helps hydrate and improve
the skin's appearance now available to
extend the color range even fuller an
innovative white foundation mixer to
adjust in customized color so innovative
no one's ever done it so that is all the
claims about this la girl is cruelty
free if you guys are liking a 15 years
foundation don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up I'm going to jump into
the makeup if you want to see how this
foundation applies and where it's
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching
alright I've already washed moisturize
and pride my face use my jouer anti
blemish matte primer X what I do every
day need coffee so they recommend using
a sponge or your fingers first
foundation so on half my face I'm use my
sponge and then on half I'm going to use
a brush just to see I have the shades
porcelain and fair here which you will
have already seen swatches of but I
haven't yet so I'm just going to do that
really quick so I think I'm gonna go in
with the shade porcelain actually you
know why I'm going to swatch this just
on my cheek for a second just to see if
I need a mixer I don't know if I do with
porcelain I do want to see how the mixer
work so I think I'm going to actually
take the shade fair I think porcelain
could work on its own if this doesn't
oxidize so I'm gonna go with the shade
fair instead so I can try out this mixer
so the white mixer consistency wise
looks about the same they're both pretty
runny and I'm doing about 1 to 2 mixer
to foundation since I use that sponge on
that bottom half we're going to use a
sponge first on this side this feels
super liquidy interesting that this is
supposed to be full coverage
on that one layer with a sponge
this definitely isn't full coverage but
it looks like a nice light to medium
coverage I'm hoping we can build this up
a little bit because of how thin the
formula is I think this might build well
so I'm going to my Sigma f80 brush on
the other side of my face it has a
little bit of like a chemically scent so
brush side I definitely got lighter
coverage this is like a light coverage
with a brush and sponge I think we got
low medium coverage so I'm gonna go in
for a second layer using that sponge
right now it's looking like a pretty
dewy finish which I personally like I
like more dewy and full coverage but
we'll see once it sets if it mattifies
it all we got
definitely more coverage on the second
layer it's still not completely full
coverage freckles are all coming through
but it does look like a really nice
amount of coverage if you like I think
next time I would spot conceal my
scarring down here because it didn't
really cover any of that as far as I can
tell I'm here this mixer has the exact
same ingredients as the foundation so
what that means to me is that it's
probably not a different formula it's
not really going to share out your
foundation it's just about the same
amount of coverage as this one with that
in mind this one is lighter medium
coverage so this might share out some of
your more full coverage foundations but
it lightened well since this is an
illuminating product I like that you can
mix this in with more matte foundations
that are too dark and it could give it
more of a dewy finish I don't think I
really have an illuminating mixer so I
like that about this when I do the
wrap-up video at the end of 15 days I'm
going to keep trying out this mixer with
other products to see how it mixes I
think I actually could have mixed in a
little bit more you can see my neck is a
tiny bit lighter right now so it
definitely has a dewy finish it's not
really mattifying at all feels like it's
starting to set but I'm definitely going
to set this one with a powder so it is
now 8:50 let's just call it the check-in
time 9 o'clock I'm going to put on the
rest my makeup and I'll be right back
alright so it's now 9:10 I'm going to
show y'all I'm going to call the
check-in time nine o'clock since that's
about when I finished the face makeup so
ended up setting my face with the
Maybelline better skin
and super-state powder really like this
stuff it definitely modified my face a
little bit it looks more like a satin
matte finish right now but with this
powder the foundation usually comes
through about halfway through the day up
close my skin does look really good
right now it looks very smooth this
foundation is not full coverage by any
means but I do really like the finish of
it right now and since it is so thin it
doesn't really look like you have a ton
of foundation on your face especially if
you only use one layer I feel like it
would look pretty natural blush bronzer
highlight blend it out totally fine on
top everything is looking good right now
so on the rest of my face
bronzer use the Too Faced milk chocolate
Soleil bronzer and I don't really like
this one
I know some people really like this for
pale skin but to me it just looks kind
of like a darker powder I think you
would just get a darker shade of like
face powder and get the same kind of
effect with this the shade is just a
little bit off for me blush and also
kind of like highlight Hello Kitty this
is brand new the yummy cookies super
shock cheek it's almost like a rose gold
highlight if you have pale skin you
could also use this as a blush which is
kind of what I did I have this base you
like all over my cheeks right now I use
a lot of color pop today and my eyes is
almost all color pop pays to other
shadows from their Hello Kitty
collection the shades small gift to the
pink shade and sticker sheet I also use
the color pop honey dude liner on my
waterline to face rather than sex
mascara then the gold is this NYX to do
liquid liner and extreme gold that's
what I did the little wing or whatever
we have going on with that yeah
literally almost used all color pop
platform and tight fit which is like a
metallic gloss is what's on my lips next
check and I do will be in natural
lighting so we have words are just not
coming today I will be back and if you
are is to check it alright so it is now
144 so the foundation has been on for
almost 5 hours I'm literally like
straddling the floor right now getting a
good leg workout the foundation looks
good it looks kind of like the Bourjois
healthy mix foundation I did a review on
sigh yesterday I think so link that one
down below but just the way that it's
sitting on my skin and the coverage too
kinda reminds me of that but it just
looks very healthy and my forehead looks
a little bit dewy but not oily ice and
just looks really like fresh going to
get
real close as you can see the texture on
this is really good for me especially
five hours in my forehead looks really
nice right now I think no creasing
around my nose or upper lip at all no
complaints right now by the way I
changed my lips this is Rimmel first
class nude
I don't know how five hours has already
gone by I literally just shopped on IKEA
for three hours I'm ordering a ton of
home decor stuff right now because I
have a super exciting new space that I
am furnishing so no complaints right now
I will check back in at the end of the
night all right so it is 7:30 so the
foundation has been on for 10 and a half
hours I hope you guys can see this right
now because I literally look like a
stick of butter
holy sees one this has majorly
oxidized definitely looks too dark now
to this oil I set this foundation with a
powder so the fact that I have this much
oil right now this is extreme oil for me
I think the only other time I've seen
this is with L'Oreal pro blow it's not
even in my t-zone it is all over my face
all over my forehead my cheeks like down
here is oily I actually can't believe
how crazy I am right now I think it
looked okay up until about the 6 or 7
hour mark after that it just went
downhill got super oily every foundation
works differently for different people
some people might love this just like
some people loved the Loreal Pro glow
that was personally one of my least
favorite foundations but I think some
people might like this it did look
really nice on my skin like I said for
the first like 6 or 7 hours
it kinda reminds me of the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD foundation the way it
looks in the coverage I'm curious to see
I'm going to try the bite mixer with
other foundations and see if it turns
into the same oily mess if you are
extremely dry and want something more
light to medium coverage more on the
light side with one layer you might like
this if you're oily stay the away
it did increase anywhere because I don't
think it has anything to crease as
literal oil so probably will pass on the
foundation but as far as a white mixer I
am going to be
continuing to play around with it and
see if it works off any other
foundations if you guys like this video
and are excited about 15 days foundation
don't forget to give this a thumbs up
love you guys thanks for watching see
you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
