Grey's Anatomy and eat hot cheetos
alright so today we have a first
impression style video on this bad boy
this has probably been the most
requested foundation from you guys in a
while this is the brand-new l'oreal
infallible pro glow foundation actually
don't have the original pro matte
foundation to show you guys because they
just finished it up and tossed it but
that foundation is awesome so I'm super
excited to try this out see how it wears
throughout the day this has gotten a ton
of hype so far already on YouTube and
social media so let's put it to the test
before we get into the claims and all
that good stuff
I want to share something super exciting
with you guys I'm excited I hope you're
excited if you follow me on snapchat or
Twitter you already know all about this
but we are going to be doing 15 days of
foundation every single day for 15 days
I'm going to be putting a new foundation
to the test these are some of my
favorite videos to make so I feel like
this is going to be super fun for you
guys and I just always have a stockpile
of foundations to review it actually
takes a long time to get through them
and do all the reviews so I figured this
would be a good way to give you guys a
ton of content and try out all the
foundations I've already chosen about
half of the foundations in win a review
but I want you guys to be able to choose
some of the foundations as well so make
sure you tweet me with the hashtag 15
days of foundation or you can snap me if
you want to cast your vote for what
foundations to review I hope you guys
are excited if you are a leave comment
down below make sure you're subscribed
so you don't miss out okay let's get
into the so this has SPF 15 so this is a
radiant finish for normal to dry skin
and is hydrating I'm going to go on
their website and read some of the
claims
so retails for around $12.99 depending
on where you buy it and it has one fluid
ounce which is standard for foundation
looks like it comes in 12 shades like
pretty much any foundation I have the
lightest shade in 2:01 it's supposed to
last up to 24 hours lightweight and
creamy long-lasting foundation goes on
smooth with a glow finish that lasts and
supposed to be hydrating with SPF for
normal to dry skin so if you want to see
how this foundation applies and wears
throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching all right I literally have not
had a sip of coffee why did I think I
should start filming woke up semi early
I keep having dreams about weddings all
right I'm feeling zero present awake
right now but we're going to do this
shaking it up we're going to do the peer
cosmetics sponge on one side and then
try a brush on the other side I'm
debating between the Sigma f80 2 and the
morphe g36
this one is a little bit less compact
like it's easier to blend I think we're
going to go in with this one first and
if we need more coverage going with this
one so I have the shade 201 obviously
this is the lightest shade and the
Loreal Pro the pebble Pro Foundation was
light enough so if you have pale skin
I'm hoping this one will work all right
no idea where any of my 10 foundation
pellets are right now so we're just
going to put this directly on the face
well it looks pretty runny off the bat
if you're new to my channel I have
combination skin cystic acne running on
spironolactone and I like full coverage
foundation so I have high hopes for this
foundation Mac in life so I can go ahead
and first go in with that morphe brush
blue it's blending pretty easy since it
is pretty liquidy definitely lighter
coverage then the pro matte foundation
so that was just one layer and pretty
much you'll see everything it covered up
some of the redness but looks like not
even a medium coverage right now it
looks pretty much like a light coverage
to me it's going with a needy blender on
the other side and see if we can get
more coverage and I put quite a bit on
as you guys saw so I'm taking this bunch
is my favorite sponge just by pure
cosmetics it has like a flat side on one
end and then we'll just pounce super
luminous like I kind of feel like I'm
wearing sunscreen and I like J
foundations but it does look a little
bit oily actually think we got better
coverage with the sponge I'm going to
sponge on my forehead and then also add
a second layer foundation to see if it's
buildable shade wised and you
to show you get shade wise it looks
pretty good no complaints on the shape
this is definitely lighter coverage than
I was expecting they claim that it's
medium coverage right now I'm not seeing
it definitely are right now I'm honestly
not loving it as much as I thought it
was going to which is slightly
disappointing
looks pretty some Screaming to me it
actually has a really similar
consistency to the Garnier BB cream
which actually has more coverage in this
formula wise and like the shine and
everything it looks pretty similar to
that I wasn't planning on setting my
face with a powder before this but now
that's on my face we are definitely
going to have to set this with the
powder just because it looks - doesn't
really look dewy to me right now it
looks pretty oily so I'm definitely
going to be setting it with a powder my
pores also look pretty large right now
we definitely look bigger than usual
around my nose in particular so right
now it's 846 I'm going to drink some
coffee apply the rest of my makeup and I
will be right back just so you guys can
see before I do that my pores look
pretty emphasized to me all right so it
is now nine oh nine goes pretty fast
nine oh nine rest of my makeup is on so
the concealer I used under my eye and in
the center of my face was Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer I set my face with
the Mac Studio Fix powder you can still
see glow enos coming through like on my
forehead which I love in a foundation I
love when you said it and it still peeks
through this is what I consider a dewy
where you can see the light reflecting
but you don't look like a freaking
greaseball I'm gonna leave the lipstick
details and necklace African obsessed
with this look at this necklace all the
info on what I'm wearing right now will
be down below I could see this being
good alone wearing it to the beach if
you just want something that's super
light coverage and you just kind of want
to look glowy and like you have a little
bit of something on your face but not
like a full-on foundation I could see
this being good for that depending on
how it wears throughout the day and how
long it lasts as far as wearing it by
itself as just a foundation I think it
looks pretty greasy well where you going
man
at my face with the hard candy fast and
fabulous makeup setting spray because on
her website did you say to set it with a
setting spray probably because they want
you use their setting spray but
regardless I use a setting spray every
single day we're going to have a pretty
good wear test today since it's only
9:00 a.m. right now so I'm going to
check back in a few hours I'm going to
go run some errands do some work and we
will be back alright so it is now 11:40
- so the foundation has been on for
three hours
I still haven't eaten I've gotten sucked
into like work and totally forgot about
my body
I am already good increasing around my
mouth area right here and around my nose
area which is actually pretty rare for
only three hours in I look pretty oily I
wouldn't call this dewy um I think I
just looked straight up oily like around
my nose area on my forehead the fact
that it's already creasing is not good
my blush bronzer highlight still looks
good but as of right now I'm not loving
it I think there's a difference between
having a dewy foundation and having a
straight up shiny foundation it's super
runny and it almost looks and feels
exactly like a sunscreen well I'm going
to go head to a cafe to get some work
done probably won't be back till later
in the evening so we'll check back when
I come home and see how it's looking
it is now 533 so the Foundation's been
on for almost nine hours some errands
got groceries which I need to unload
right now and I have to say that the
foundation looks a lot better when you
are outside which I feel like it's kind
of rare definitely around my nose looks
pretty horrible don't usually get nose
creasing but this is pretty bad I don't
like the way it looks on my skin maybe
with a mattifying powder but I feel like
that kind of defeats the purpose if you
have super super dry skin you might like
this if you're oily
stay the away from this there's
definitely oil coming off on my forehead
is not that it just looks dewy my skin
is actually oily as well yep
and around my nose - probably going to
do one more check in in a couple hours
but in my opinion so far I'm not a fan
of this we'll definitely try mixing this
in with other
products I feel like this will actually
be a really nice mixer since it is a bit
liquidy and it has a luminous finish so
if you have a foundation like Estee
Lauder Double Wear or something that's
like super heavy or Kat Von D locket
tattoo foundation something that's super
heavy and has really high coverage and
you just want to give it a little bit
more skin like appearance I feel like
this would probably be really nice to
mix in with it
but on its own for me not feeling it I'm
sure this is going to be one of those
foundations that a lot of people love
and that is the beauty of YouTube go
watch different reviews on different
skin types like always products work
differently for different people I'm
going to last checking in a couple hours
so after 11 hours of where and we'll see
how it's looking okay it's only a little
bit later at 7 o'clock this is going to
be my last check-in because I feel like
a freaking grease ball right now and I
got lipstick on my nose on my chin don't
ask me how that happened just to wrap it
up overall thoughts I am pretty
underwhelmed by this foundation I just
watched a few reviews which was the
first time I seen any reviews on this
foundation so far seems like a lot of
people liked it personally I'm not a fan
didn't work for me but definitely by all
means try it out for yourself I think
people are really excited about the idea
of the Provo foundation just because the
first one was so amazing maybe I'm just
being an overly harsh critic but I yeah
I'm not impressed at all I think it
actually looks pretty shitty on my skin
this is a pass for me if you're new to
my channel join the baby doe family and
click the subscribe button I do a ton of
foundation videos if you guys like this
video and you want to see more
foundation reviews give it a thumbs up
so I know comment down below with any
foundations that you want to see during
15 days of foundation love you guys
thanks for watching see in my next video
