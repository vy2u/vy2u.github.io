Friday happy foundation Friday this
products that we're going to be talking
about today between this and the silly
sponge this would like taken over my
inbox the last couple weeks so lots of
you guys have wanted to see this
actually smash this on Amazon early
fulfillment is a week in advance so buy
time you guys do this you might be able
to get this in stores by now but in my
time I had to order this thing on Amazon
this is the brand-new l'oreal infallible
total cover full coverage weightless
feel 24-hour foundation i have a review
on the Loreal Pro glow foundation that
one really did not work for me at all
not my cup of tea I realized I don't
actually have a full video on the pro
matte foundation so let me know down
below if you guys would want to see that
so on Amazon you can find this for
$10.99 I've seen us between about 11
bucks and 13 dollars so according to
Amazon there are 12 shades in this
foundation I have the shade 3:01 classic
ivory which is the lightest shades when
I first got this in the mail I thought I
ordered the wrong shade because my
foundation shades never start in the
number-three but they actually numbered
these according to lines so the pro
matte foundation start in the 100's Pro
blow to hundreds and the total cover 300
so this is the lightest shade classic
ivory this is supposed to have a natural
finish we're up to 24 hours have high /
complete coverage and air light texture
so let's read some of the claims on
Amazon does it blends instantly to cover
dark spots blemishes scars and
hyperpigmentation a blood of all those
things for a flawless complexion this
foundation is formulated with high load
pigments for full coverage and it's
enriched with Alia gel will never hurt
that that's pretty much it to get one
fluid ounce of product in here which is
standard for foundation all of my
foundations are currently in my office
waiting to be unpacked them I try and do
some foundation swatches when I go over
there today so you can see Spencer's
footage right now of this foundation
compared to some of the other products
that I own all right so watch time I'm
actually doing this at home right now so
I don't have all the foundations that I
would normally swatch next to this I
guess if you just so you can see shade
comparisons so right here is the L'Oreal
total cover and 3:01 the lightest shade
this is derma called 2:08 Urban Decay
Naked Skin Foundation and
0.5 cover growth we met BB in the
lightest shade and the new la girl pro
HD foundation in the shade fair so that
is everything let's jump into the video
if you're new here you can join the
burrito family and subscribe
I do tons of foundation videos and full
pale-skinned playlists 15 is foundation
foundation Friday everything's down
below if you want to see my thoughts on
the L'Oreal infallible total cover
foundation you're in the right place
just keep watching all right I am so
frickin excited to try this one out
right now so one side of my face I'm
gonna use my ELF brush a link is down
below I always forget the exact name of
this but it will be down below and on
the other half and use my pure cosmetic
sponge you're not using my Real
Techniques one today because it's packed
away in the office but I love this
sponge also has a flat top like the Real
Techniques sponge and this is just
stained I have washed this so first I'm
gonna go on off the brush on the side of
my face you shake it it sounds very
thick so the applicator has this squeeze
tube it's a finer point than the other
two bottles I'm going to squeeze from
this whoa this is thick holy views
almost looks like a fake mousse this is
like not moving anywhere my hair is like
beyond just needing to get done right
now so that's why it's been in a button
laughs like ten videos my dad's on and
then go in and blend with the brush
feels very cooling maybe mine is just
freezing in the bottle but it feels
frickin cold
okay let's blend well okay this feels
like it dries very quick so you got
definitely got to work fast with this
one it feels weird it's really
lightweight even though it feels you
like thick when you're blending it out
so one layer with a brush we got good
coverage it's not full coverage without
this looks like medium coverage so let's
try this side with the sponge it
literally feels like it almost sets the
second it hits your face so you really
have to work quick feels a little bit
hard to blend out with the sponge and I
think I got lighter coverage with a
sponge it almost gets a little bit
patchy
I definitely got better coverage on the
brush side this side looks like medium
coverage this looks like low medium
coverage is a lot more coming through on
this side finish on my cheeks
it looks pretty the same because we
don't have a lot of texture there but on
my forehead where I do
texture and some dry spots it's a sponge
I've looked a lot better not the best
coverage so I'm definitely going to have
to go in with a little bit more on the
second layer to see if we can get this
to full coverage because yeah it's
really not so coverage I think if I go
in with a little bit more product on a
brush it's just going to look really
cakey so I am going to use a sponge
again and just kind of stipple this on
okay so still not getting full coverage
that actually looked like it didn't do a
whole lot kind of expecting a little
more excitement whoa what just happened
okay so my forehead is not looking great
at all all of my dry areas and texture
are very emphasized right now on my
forehead I'll show you guys the
close-ups in a second not getting a
whole lot more coverage on the second
layer at all interesting okay so off the
bat with all the textures going on if
you have dry skin don't think you would
like this I have combination skin I
usually get pretty oily throughout the
day on my t-zone but I do have some dry
patches on my forehead and my pores
right now are looking very big the
texture on my forehead is just there's a
lot of it okay it's always hard with the
lights to actually show you the texture
but I hope you guys can see you in the
center of my face I don't think you can
see this over here but there we go it
looks really dry and weird also don't
judge me I need to do my roots I don't
know the certain parts that just look a
little bit patchy to me yeah like down
here right now not loving it if I set my
face with this powder right now I think
it would totally totally cake up and I
would just have a ton of texture going
on even more than I already have so I'm
not going to set my face to the powder
today but is 9:56 right now I'm going to
call it check at time 10 o'clock I'm
gonna do the rest of makeup and we'll be
right back okay so this now 10:10 tells
us so this is weird so I went into the
bathroom and my face looks totally
different texture was way less so I grab
the mirror went out to natural lighting
and it looked 50 times better in natural
lighting so then I came back in here and
I think what happened is it just needs a
few minutes to like warm up your face
because now on my forehead it does look
still textures that is way less than it
was before now it looks a lot smoother
overall right now I'm liking it a little
bit better than ten minutes ago so I
think it's just one of those products
that needs a little bit to warm up to
your face I didn't set this with the
powder I just put on my normal makeup on
top of it so blush runs our highlight
but oh and I'm still in the toilet what
freaking love the tile is my goddess of
love hand still get it on eBay it's just
a little bit more expensive but swear to
God sources so blush bronzer and
highlight which he saw blended out
totally fine on top for not siding with
a powder at the bronzer actually blended
out really easily if I use the Sigma
lime light bronzer and then the blush I
also uses eye Sigma and I've been using
this everyday the past few days this is
the peaceful powder brush - brush blush
if you have more fair skin and you want
to blush that isn't super intense and
she's gonna look super natural really
nice
they're super basic makeup today I just
put that same bronzer and the crease on
my eyes use my Too Faced better than sex
mascara and then lips are my babies this
is my liquid lipstick with B here this
is 1548 if you missed the announcement
video I'll link it down below you guys
are seeing recipes went on sale
yesterday no I'm super excited I hope
you guys love the shades leave the links
for these down below obviously again
check-in time is 10 o'clock I'm gonna go
unpack the office and trying to get all
my makeup into the Alex drawers so I can
start getting everything set up and
filming over there so I'm going to go
and pack for a few hours I will check
back in in natural lighting
alright so it's now - 10 p.m. so
foundations down for about 4 hours
I'm holding this heavy-ass mirror with
one hand attempting the film with this
hand smashed on the iPhone right now but
I got this app that gives you 4k video
so let me know if you can tell okay and
you put this mirror down so weighs like
20 pounds so looking at the foundation I
actually think it looks way better right
now than when I first applied it or even
within the first hour it's kind of like
warmed up to my face it looks
nice and smooth from the front of a
giant window right now so this is like
true natural lighting I'm in the office
by the way I'm vlogging and snapchatting
but I just realize didn't tell you guys
that yeah around my nose no creasing at
all my foreheads looks gooey it
definitely doesn't look matte anymore
but it doesn't look oily at this point
on its own not 100% enough coverage for
me next time I use this I would probably
put on one layer and then spot conceal
all right so it is now 8:16 p.m. so if
Foundation's been on for a little over
10 hours so clearly I'm looking pretty
dang oily I think it started getting
noticeably oily at about the 7 hour
point though not horrible but right now
it is like yes super super oily but that
being said I've been on snapchat all day
and a bunch of you guys have messages
that you love the way that this looks
you didn't know what product it was yet
and I did like how it looked in the
middle portion of the day so they can
kind of hit all spectrums with this one
it looks super dry and textured and
gross when I first put on then a couple
hours in it looked really good and now I
am very very oily I still don't think
this is one that I would powder just
because when you first put it on since
it has that Mufi almost like dry feel to
it and don't think a powder would sit
well on top of this at all for me
doesn't have enough coverage I don't
think this is full coverage by any means
mixed feelings but for what it's
supposed to be I don't really think it
is mature and dry skin I don't think
this one is for you I think this really
is more for normal skin possibly oily
maybe blotting throughout the day would
help
I personally don't blot because I just
want my foundation to stay on that you
have foundations that last totally fine
the entire day I'm just not a blotter by
the way before I forget I didn't touch
out my lipstick at all today this is how
I wore throughout two meals had some
chips and guac and beans and then I also
had a burger really healthy but a burger
of fries for dinner and this is how it
works I didn't want to touch up the
center just so you can see 10 hours of
wear liquid lipstick I think it's pretty
good that's kind of my sauce on this one
not super impressed don't think it's
horrible I'm going to keep playing
around with it and mixing it by itself
not enough coverage for me I think I've
said everything in
to say if you liked this video and it
was helpful for you make sure you give
it a thumbs up
love you guys thanks for watching see
you max video bye just try an end of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
