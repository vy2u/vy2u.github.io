impression style review video on the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion
buildable luminous foundation I just
dyed my roots and it got a little crazy
so today's a beanie day so L'Oreal came
out with their version of a cushion
foundation cushion foundations are super
popular with Asian booty-booty brands
with asian beauty brands and they're
just starting to come to the US so I
know Physicians Formula just also came
out with the cushion foundation which I
really want to try because from what
I've seen the coverage looks a lot
better than this one I'm going to go on
a manhunt today to find that foundation
today we're talking about this one so I
have to shade w-2 because there is ZERO
trace of w1 anywhere I've looked online
I've looked in stores I asked you guys
on Instagram no one can find the shade
w1 or any of the one shades the lightest
shades from what I can tell online and
everywhere is that there's twelve shades
out right now
starting at the two range so if you have
pale skin like I do you're kind of
out of luck on this one I don't know if
they're testing out those shades to see
how they do and then they'll release the
whole line like they have in the actual
true match foundation line even if this
is supposed to be the second to lightest
shade this is freaking dark I still
wanted to try it and try and make it
work so I could get this video up for
you guys and tell you what I think of it
but if you're pale don't buy this yet I
am obviously wearing this right now but
I feel like if I wasn't wearing a shirt
that was coming up to my neck it would
definitely look way too dark I haven't
seen this cheaper than 14.99 anywhere I
believe I got this for 1699 on ulta.com
so it's actually sold out on drugstore
comm right now on alsa there's still
some shades in stock so onto the
packaging you obviously have a cushion
compact kind of situation I love the
rose gold I think the packaging is
really pretty so before we get into the
first impression part of the video I'm
just going to read some of their claims
and innovative sponge drenched in liquid
foundation I love how its innovative but
Asian brands have been doing it for
years
anyways so tap a little for fresh
natural glow tap on more to build a new
level of luminous coverage effortless
application completely buildable sheered
a medium build a buildable coverage and
it says this for all skin types let's
get into the first impression review if
you guys like
style videos give it a thumbs up so I
know it helps me out if you want to see
what I think of this foundation and see
how it applies and wears throughout the
day and all that good stuff you're in
the right place just keep watching okay
so I started applying this foundation
thinking that there was no way I was
going to be able to do
first impressions that you on it because
it's going to be way too dark like look
at that thing but I started applying it
to this side of my face it is way too
dark but I think if I blend it down my
neck with the shirt I'm wearing I think
we can try it out so this side does have
one layer on and then you can see this
side without anything clearly having
some breakouts going on so we can see
how well it covers it up so far it's a
light coverage super natural finish I do
like the finish of it looks just like
skin I just dyed my roots so that's the
situation going on so I think I'm going
to try and wear this today hopefully
it's not like way too way too dark like
I said in the intro I have the shade n2
but basically what we're going to do is
use this little pad that it comes with
you just press it in and you get it
actually quite a bit of product when you
do that and then you just kind of use
like rolling motions and press it into
your skin okay so let's see how good it
covers up this spot not bad actually you
can still definitely see it but
definitely helped cover it up I feel
like I am using a lot more than they say
you need if you had like already good
skin and you just need something to even
out your skin tone
one little pounce of this could probably
cover a whole side of your face yeah
definitely too dark at least it's not
like oranjee too dark though it just
looks like baiji too dark kind of I
don't know that's what I'm telling
myself from everything I've watched and
learned about cushion foundations you
don't want to like swipe the pad it's
just going to give you way less coverage
they're really best applied by like a
patent troll kind of application
I don't know how sanitary this is if
you're using this every single day like
it's not the kind of material that you
can wash no definitely a brush or a
Beauty Blender would probably be more
sanitary okay so I feel like we have one
coat fully on now it feels like it's
almost fully
set on this side a little bit is coming
off when I press my pinky in and I think
we are going to set this with the powder
from what I've seen it is one of those
products that you need to set especially
if you have more oily skin I'm actually
pretty normal
combo right now so nothing's super oily
but I'm just going in with a thin second
coat to see if we can build up the
coverage at all and doesn't really look
like we're getting any better coverage I
think it's going to stay about a light
to medium coverage I'm going to set this
with a powder that's super light just to
even out the color a little bit I don't
look like Snooki rocking around Seattle
tonight okay so I'm going to apply the
rest of my makeup and then we will be
right back okay so here's what it looks
like with the rest of my makeup on I
forgot to mention that I did prime my
face I use the makeup forever hydrating
primer and then to set my face I use a
super thin layer of the Maybelline fit
me powder this is in 100 the matte and
poreless version for some reason just
the way that this is looking on my face
I have a feeling it's going to oxidize
but we'll see I do love the finish like
even putting a matte powder over top you
can definitely still see the luminosity
peeking through I did use a ton of
highlight today on my cheekbone so we
can ignore that when I put the powder on
top it kind of wiped off some of the
coverage on some spots like you can see
this acne sticking out right here this
it I also use the setting spray this is
what I use every single day with every
single foundation so I feel like it's a
fair test so it is a kind of it 2:35
holy how is it 235 I'm going to
finish filming the other video eat some
lunch probably go get my nails done it's
Saturday and get some editing done and
I'll be back in a few hours to see how
the foundation is looking all right it
is four o'clock so it's been on for
about an hour and a half I just wanted
to check in kind of early because the
Sun Goes Down here at like 4:30 so we
literally have like a half hour left of
light and here's what it looks in
natural lighting so you guys can see the
color isn't horrible with the powder on
top but like you can definitely see the
line here which is why I'm wearing a
scarf and I've just accepted the hair
dye I'll check back in a few hours I
think I might be meeting up with rage
for dinner if she ever answers her phone
yeah okay so it is a tip 804 we're in
Fred Meyer
kind of morally do you think it's oily
I'll go a little bit on my forehead
around my nose there's like a little bit
of something going on
definitely zits are like peeking through
look at that one that one is red either
part equally is oxidized it's even
darker than it was before I'm not taking
off this scarf you're Elsa look like
Snooki okay it's only I think a half
hour later but I feel like I just got
exponentially oily that looks so
disgusting yeah
feeling super oily in my nose literally
looks wet oh definitely coming off my
forehead wash it on with your fingers
though you have to like hold it from the
side something like that what do you
mean leave oil blot me yeah there we go
I've never used an oil blotter but if it
comes off yeah I'll be like that's look
at wild you can see the pores looks
bizarre is that what three come off whoa
there's a lot on there whoa soap yeah Oh
Matthew eight show them nah it
definitely has come off fully on my side
right here I don't know des cos I was
wearing a scarf but it's like not
looking cute on the chin or anything
okay it's 11:11 and I just want to show
you guys on the good camera so you can
see how shitty this looks and I feel
like I broke out a ton today yeah it
looks pretty crappy this is after
blotting it with oil sheets I wouldn't
say I'm someone who gets especially oily
definitely not this oily where you can
see it like around my nose area right
here in like just my whole face looks
super oily I'll probably be returning
this thumbs down for me if you tried
this funny shoe and let me know what you
guys think of it if you like first
impressions videos and you want to see
more give it a thumbs up so I know love
you guys thanks for watching see you my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
