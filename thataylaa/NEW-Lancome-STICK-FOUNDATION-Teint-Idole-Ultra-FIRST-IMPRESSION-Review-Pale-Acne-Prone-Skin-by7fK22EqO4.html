jack-in-the-box chocolate right now all
right so today we have a first
impression on the brand new Lancome
don't know how to say this tint idol
ultra makeup stick so Lancome has a
normal liquid foundation version of this
and then they just came out with this
makeup stick version don't you love it
when you have an itch on your nose and
you're covered in foundation so I do
have the liquid version of this
foundation which I like I like to mix it
in with foundations because it's pretty
light it is pretty freakin matte oh I
don't like to wear by itself but I do
like to mix it in with other foundations
so when I saw this on Sephora I was like
hell yeah let's try it
I'm all about the makeup forever stay
foundation that's one of my favorite
foundations I think it is beautiful the
formula of that is like it should win an
award I have a whole review on that
stick foundation so I will link that in
description box down below getting into
this foundation so this has SPF 21
that is very specific says it has a soft
matte finish and it's for all skin types
let's look at some of the claims on
their website from Sephora says it's a
24 hour we're highly pigmented
foundation stick that provides high
coverage in a weightless texture for a
matte finish suppose the last 24 hours
don't know why you have your fiendish on
24 hours let's see had a good night
says it contains porous polymers that
absorb excess acne producing oils I
don't know what porous polymers are but
if it reduces acne producing oils great
leaving the skin looking mattified and
shine free and it says is suitable for
all skin types even sensitive skin so I
have normal combo skin super sensitive
super acne prone so hopefully it says it
break me out retails for
are well there's a lot of shades I think
there are 20 shades if I just counted
right
you only get point three ounces which is
a not a lot at all usually standard
foundation has one flow down with that
being said a little bit of this does go
a super long way so we are going to try
this thing out all day today see how
long it lasts if you're new to my
channel and you're also a pale princess
I have a whole pale skin playlist linked
in the description box below so if you
want to see how this makeup applies and
wears throughout the day you're in the
right place just keep watching Cheers
okay we are going to be testing out this
guy today we're in the living room right
now mostly because I didn't want to have
to clean my room for this video it is
9:30 a.m. on a Saturday so this is what
the packaging looks like just super
basic stick it actually looks pretty
cheap to me like the plastic feels a lot
cheaper than the makeup forever one and
I got the shade 110 ivorie 110 says for
porcelain skin with cool pink undertones
this isn't even printed on here now I'm
looking at it is literally a sticker
which is pretty cheap for the prices so
as you can see still have acne going on
it is healing a lot like a lot of these
are actually scars now I've been using
the Aztec play healing mask or whatever
from Amazon but do you have a lot to
cover up so we can see how a bit of
coverage this has here's what the shade
looks like so I already moisturized and
primed my face I use the first aid
beauty oil rescue mattifying gel this
doesn't actually help to control your
oil I don't think but it's a nice
moisturizer that doesn't break me out
and then I use the jouer anti blemish
matte primer and I also feel like this
doesn't help with the oil so I don't
think they're going to alter the
foundation too much this just has
salicylic acne treatment in it so my
favorite way to apply the makeup forever
stick foundation is with the Sigma f80 -
this is a super dense brush and it just
blends out cream product really well I
believe I have a 10% off code for this
brush so I'll leave it down below but
we're just going to go to town actually
no first we're having coffee
well first thoughts feels very similar
to the make up forever stick except it
feels even more lightweight like I
literally feel like I'm blending nothing
on my face right now whoa definitely has
a pink tone to it which I actually
prefer for my skin tone super quick
super easy really good coverage I'm
going to do a second layer after I do my
full face to see how much of this we can
cover up but overall like that took what
10 seconds and it looks like I have like
a solid almost full coverage it might be
a tad bit too dark and now that I'm
looking at my face compared to my neck
so let's do this side
yeah like you you literally can't feel
anything on your brush looks like it's a
pretty matte finish almost a little bit
satin matte actually we are getting some
light reflecting off the skin which I
really like is this supposed to last 24
hours we will see oh that's a cool
design yeah a tad bit too dark very
pleasantly surprised right now I feel
like this is the same reaction I had to
the other stick foundation but that
blended out super easily I'm liking the
coverage I have some dry patches up here
it does look like it's clinging a little
bit too but nothing horrible I like that
it covered up everything we can still
see some of my like freckles and just
skin underneath I'm going with a quick
second layer just so many spots that we
need a little bit more coverage to see
if it's buildable oh yeah totally
buildable and I feel like that just
covered up all my acne so here is a
close-up I'm literally like on my table
right now I think it looks really nice
it has kind of like a natural satin
matte finish covered up everything so
I'm going to apply the rest of my makeup
and I will be right back alright so it
is now 10:17 the rest of my makeup is on
clearly so first impressions now that I
have the rest of my makeup on I really
like the finish of it it looks like a
really nice satin matte finish my
forehead looks a little bit luminous but
not overdo e-theta definitely a little
bit dark you can see it on my neck
compared to down on my chest
I do think it's doable I don't think
it's like way too dark or anything and I
like the tone of it I just wish it was
like a half a shade to shade lighter in
the same time putting concealer on top
felt a little bit interesting I feel
like it got a little bit less coverage
for some reason it dried super fast like
I had no problem blending out bronzer
and stuff overtop I didn't put any kind
of setting powder on today because it
says it's supposed to last for 24 hours
and it's a semi matte foundation so
we're just going to see how it wears by
itself I did use a setting spray because
I use that every single day really nice
on the skin sitting totally fine my
pores don't look overly emphasised or
anything
yeah no complaints so far so like I said
1020 I have some errands to run I've got
to go grocery shopping so I'm going to
check back in a few hours and we'll see
how the foundation is looking alright so
it is now 309 so the foundation has been
on for up to 5 hours now
really like that's a really long time so
I've just been working all day I've just
put up my colour-pop ultra satin lips
video so if you haven't seen that should
watch it let's check in with the
foundation looking pretty good my
forehead looks a little bit shiny
feeling
Oh feels a little bit oily I think we
might get oily in a couple more hours
but nothing horrible right now I do
think it has oxidized of it I think is
actually showing up a little bit lighter
on camera but like in certain lighting
like when I'm looking at my mirror here
it looks the quite a bit darker so I'm
going to go get my nails done with rage
grab some dinner and then I will check
back in at the end of the night ok so it
is 8:55 p.m. it's been on for 11 hours
oh that's a good one
I feel like they look a little oily so
close it don't ya well it's really but
not like bad just like dewy it doesn't
look like it's coming off either yeah
that's good yeah I feel like it looks
like all the coverage stayed on you see
anything coming through I feel like my
white forehead does look pretty oily
though your foreign your nose yeah I
didn't apply a powder though so maybe
with the powder of this would be better
so just give it just a ooh we're getting
real close personal the pores overall I
feel like I would wear it again I would
just powder it next time
I think it did oxidize a little bit
throughout the day but nothing horrible
alright so that was everything if you
guys

we know in the comments down below what
foundation you want to see next
I did like kind of a poll on Instagram
and a lot of people wanted to see the
Maybelline Dream matte whatever the new
foundation is I'm like so dreading

want to put it on my face again like I'm
not a fan just throwing it out there but
