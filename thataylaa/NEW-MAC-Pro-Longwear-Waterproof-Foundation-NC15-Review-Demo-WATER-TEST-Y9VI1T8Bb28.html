life I think Mac just made that up
all right so today we're going to be
talking about foundation these are like
my favorite kind of videos to do I think
I just love a good new foundation this
is the Mac Pro Longwear nourishing
waterproof foundation I'm in the shade
nc15 which is a tiny bit dark but it can
work this is a fairly new foundation
from Mac I think it's been out for a
couple months now and I just ordered it
from Nordstrom's I'll leave the link
down below where you can get it
I like North Jones because it's free
return shipping so if you don't like
something keep your seat and you can
send this back if you don't like it so
this is supposed to be a waterproof
formula that lasts for 24 hours again
don't know why you would need your
foundation to last for 24 hours we're
not going to be testing 24 but we're
going to be testing probably like 10
hours this is a oil-free watertight
foundation it's basically supposed to
like repel water from your face when I
go to like the beach or pool or
something I don't usually wear
foundation I usually just put a tiny bit
of like concealer on my acne scars and
call today if this repels water we might
have to try it out if you're someone who
likes to wear foundation when you go
swimming I totally get that I used to be
like that
this could be super helpful for you
because your foundation won't slide off
your face which is always a plus so that
the formula blends seamlessly on the
skin with medium to full weightless
coverage and natural satin finish so I
agree with both of those claims and when
people think of Mac they think of like
heavy full duty foundations and products
this is probably like one of their most
weightless feeling foundations I've ever
tried I love the finish of it you can
see this light lifting off my forehead
it definitely is a good satin kind of
finish this retails for $32 then it's
only 0.8 4 fluid ounces so standard
foundation is one fluid ounce that's a
little bit less and it is pretty freakin
pricey I probably had to use like a
quarter sized amount on my whole face
and my craigslist person just canceled
just read some of the claims on Mac's
website transfer-resistant long-wearing
instant and long-term hydration I
definitely think that's true it gives
your face
like a nice moisturize kind of look I
think this would be okay if you have dry
skin it doesn't look like it clung to
any of my dry patches oil-free provides
stay true color I'm assuming that means
that it doesn't oxidize which is great
dermatologist tested non acne genic I've
never even heard that word in my life I
think Mac just made that up and so this
for all skin types so those are some of
the claims I'm going to show you guys
how it applied in this video and then
we're going to do some checkups
throughout the day and a water test
later on because that sounds like a
great time to me so if you guys want to
see my thoughts on this foundation
you're in the right place just keep
watching so much caffeine needs to
happen right now work sure all right
we're going to be trying out this
foundation today I totally forgot I
worded this and when it came in the mail
and it felt like Hanukkah so as you can
apply this directly to your face with a
finger sponge or foundation or concealer
brush the bottom looks pretty tiny I'm
going to shade nc15 I've seen a couple
of good reviews on this foundation so
I'm excited boys I was ready to take
before shot what's this it was so not
awake right now
Oh what are you doing no shits given
right now okay so I'm just going to put
a little bit on my back my palate wow
this is a lot of runnier than I was
expecting
okay so here's how my skin looks like up
close my overall skin right now is
really healthy this is all acne scarring
and then I have like one healings it
over here
not super runny where you can see it
starting to me a little bit dab some
feels super thin
looks really nice looks like I didn't
put anything on like it just looks like
my skin all right so here's half of my
face it looks really nice it's not
settling and my pores at all which I
like I've been having issues with my
pores lately like they're just come out
to party see how much coverage we can
get this is like the true test okay
really
so again I'm just going to dot first I
just feel like that helps to spread it
out a little bit evenly dispersed and
the brush that I'm using is the Sigma
f80 - foundation brush I find this gives
the best coverage for me and I did prime
my face to prime my face I used my body
shop teaching primer use that every
single day so I feel like it's an
accurate kind of test all right so that
covered pretty dang well I probably put
a couple dots of concealer right there
but everything else is looking really
nice and it doesn't look or feel heavy
at all let's do the head it's
interesting that they put it in that
kind of bottle though because I feel
like usually thicker formulas come in
those kind of levels okay so I think I
used a quarter-sized amount of product
total on my face even though my skin
tone covered a lot of my acne scarring
I still can't see a couple peeking
through it there Oh color wise we didn't
talk about the color I think the color
works if it doesn't oxidize they don't
usually have a problem with Mac
Foundation's oxidizing so we should be
good let's apply this as a concealer and
see how much it covers also have two
band-aids going on right now
the moving and unpacking has been
getting a little intense when you spot
concealer it definitely helps to cover
everything up a little bit more it's
giving good coverage we can still I
think it still looks like my skin like
you can still see some freckles and
stuff peeking through which I haven't
been minding lately I actually kind of
prefer it just because it makes your
face look more real you know I think I'm
just going to apply my concealer and
stuff while I'm on here with you guys so
for under-eye concealer I use the Urban
Decay Naked skin holy grail is
light enough it is amazing and you need
it in your life I'm gonna try not bring
it down as far as AJ do just because I
want to see how my foundation does
around the pores I'm just going to Pat
on my under eye with my position for me
like correcting powder usually what I've
been doing lately is just powdering that
dry and then taking whatever is left
over on the brush and just like dabbing
it over my t-zone I'm literally just
going to go like that all right so I'm
refilling a whole other tutorial on the
rest of my makeup so I will be right
back alright so I have the rest of my
makeup on feeling the green lip today I
did film a whole other shadowing
schmooze get ready with me video on this
look so just check the down bar
everything will be down there so the
foundation is looking really nice it
looks freaking great I would say like a
solid medium coverage just because you
can still see some acne scarring peeking
through it can still see some freckles
on my nose I don't think it's like fully
complete full coverage it's not really
settling anywhere it's just sitting nice
and I'm excited to see how it builds up
throughout the day so it's already been
on for about an hour
it is now 1209 I'm going to be checking
in throughout the day with you guys and
we're going to do a water test at the
end of the day excited for that I'm
actually really excited for that yeah
good stuff so far alright so it is the
end of the night it is now 9:50 p.m.
today was like crazy busy OHS assembling
furniture and just running around forgot
to check in but here's this foundation
is looking like looks pretty freaking
good there's some spots like on my nose
where it looks like it's rubbed off a
little bit overall for all like the
sweating and it was raining today my
bronzer and highlight and everything is
still completely on there's no creasing
around my mouth which can happen
sometimes it's a little bit oily but
nothing horrible nothing like more than
I usually have and let's do the water
test I have to recruit Rachael for this
hey Rach will you film something for me
really quick in here in here get on the
water test on water tested
Valley Forge circle they're repelled
Buffy that just pulls right off that's
look like it looks the same look exactly
after towns better hey flash yeah do it
that's wild
Wow yeah good job Matt how long where
all right here's after the water test in
the lights you guys can see it literally
did not take off anything I even like
rub my hands around a little bit and
it's fully still on so this would be an
awesome foundation if you're looking for
one to wear to the pool or there's a
torrential downpour you never know if
you guys like this video give it a
thumbs up so I know comment down below
with what foundations you want me to try
