of foundation if you're new here this is
where we are trying out a new foundation
every single day for 15 days first 10
days will be linked down below in a
playlist called
15 days of foundation you can go start
from the beginning get your foundation
fixed like I mentioned what's the
foundations I'm choosing for this are
ones that you guys have requested or
that are super hyped up this guy
actually came in the mail yesterday this
is the brand-new Make Up For Ever
water blend foundation which is
basically the face of body foundation
reformulated I asked you guys on
snapchat if you want to see the water
blend foundation or the Smashbox to do
Skin Foundation which they came out with
new shades of this they came out the
light shade 0.5 and they also
reformulated this or if you wanted to
see the water blend foundation I had you
guys screenshot to vote which one you
want to see during 15 days of foundation
and this one won by about over half are
going for this one even though I think
personally I would like this one a
little bit better just because of the
coverage which we'll get into I am still
going to be reviewing a Smashbox to do
skin so just make sure you subscribe so
you don't miss out on that put the
disclaimer out there because I know
someone will comment post on Twitter and
Facebook a few weeks ago all my thoughts
on PR packages and doing a reason
products that are sent as PR packages I
have nothing wrong with it personally
because I tell the truth no matter what
the soap &amp;amp; Glory foundation was sent as
a PR package and that one I hated and I
told you guys exactly what I thought of
it and the same is for this and anything
else I talk about on my channel I
usually talk about this because I don't
feel like I need to because it doesn't
influence my opinion whatsoever I think
people get a little bit confused about
products that are sent as PR packages
versus a sponsorship I want to get into
in this video probably and do a whole
other video on my thoughts on that and
just where I stand
so anyways they sent three shades the
water blend foundation which we're
trying out to the egg the three shades I
have our are 210 y 215 and y 225 I'm
going to watch all three shades for you
right now so you can see what the shades
look like in comparison to some other
foundations okay it's watch time so
right here is the makeup forever water
blend foundation in our 210 this one is
y 215 which I actually think looks a
little bit lighter I'm doing these
swatches after
this whole video so I wish I'd watch
these before because I actually think I
would have gone with this one to 15 does
look a little bit lighter to me
this one is why 225 right here we have
the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation
in Y 205 this one's the golden rustic
foundation that we did a review on on
day 8 I believe and this one's the
oldest stick foundation that I also did
in 15 days so stone de chien is going to
retail for $43 it's available online
right now on Make Up For Ever calm it
will be in Sephora online on July 22nd
and in stores on August 5th so you can
buy it right now you just have to get it
off with makeup forever website has a
glass bottle and a pump which is always
great and it has one point six nine
fluid ounces of product the standard is
usually one fluid ounce of products you
are actually getting a bit more product
for your money so let's read some of the
claims it says it's buildable
lightweight formula delivers a flawless
and dewy finish with a beautiful even
complexion it comes in 20 shades and
like I said so face and body foundation
reformulated 80% of the formula is
purified water infused with vitamin b5
it's waterproof and trick alright don't
remember what we were talking about
buildable coverage lightweight line that
says created with 80% water this
long-lasting unique water gel texture
naturally hydrates and blends and even
first smooth flawless look that's pretty
much all the plans for those of you who
don't know I have cystic acne I
typically like a more full coverage
foundation I have combination oily skin
I usually get pretty oily throughout the
day my t-zone so sheer foundations
usually aren't what I go for
but I wanted to try this out since you
guys wanted to see it I am going to be
doing a video at the end of 15 days
foundation ranking all the foundations
one through 15 so you can see the ones I
like the most and the ones I didn't like
at all before I said I'm going to do
that day 15 I think I'm actually gonna
make a separate video like the best and
worst of 15 days foundation that will be
coming up so if you want to see how the
makeup forever water blend foundation
applied somewhere throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching
okay it's 8:15 in the morning it says
for best results moisten a sponge this
is the new morphe sponge spray it with
two sprays of the mix and fix setting
spray and they recommend to use a step
one skin equalizing hydrating primer
however online online it says use the
step one hydrating primer to get a duir
and lighter finish I don't think I'm
going to want a lighter finish with this
one so I think I'm going to use this on
half of my base we can see if there is a
difference and I have a brush here as
backup
ace we need more coverage the only
review I've seen on this so far is
Mallory's Mallory 17:12
I love her she has very very nice
flawless skin already even on her it
looks pretty sheer I'm now trying this
one for you guys gonna stay optimistic
but I think we may need to do some
concealing afterwards because I got a
lot to cover up so I just put my face on
the right side so I have three shades
here of our to 10 y to 15 and then Y to
25 or think yeah I'm going to go ahead
and use our 210 and I am going to spray
the sponge like they say twice with some
setting spray three times I guess says
to squirt it out and apply it to the
back of your hand it's actually not as
liquid yet as I was imagining it's not
really moving right here and go ahead
and apply it says to start from a Sun
for your face and work outwards oh no oh
no this one by over double on snapchat
when you guys voted not gonna I was
hoping you would go for the Smashbox to
do skin I know that one is going to have
better coverage but we're still doing
this I've talked about 2 pumps probably
on the back of my hand and it's totally
gone it's supposed to be buildable
though I think this is the sheerest
foundation November 1 definitely more
geared for someone who wants a very
sheer coverage if you have freckles that
you don't want to cover up they just
want to kind of even have your skin
this might be a good one for you because
it does take away some of the redness
but it doesn't cover anything thing I'm
going to do is find on the other side
too and then we might use a brush to get
more coverage so as you can see didn't
cover up a whole lot I'm actually going
to show you guys up close so you can see
what it looks like with one layer I'm
not wearing earrings didn't really cover
anything it did even out the redness
though I'm going to go in for a second
layer with my brush definitely got more
coverage with a brush still looks like a
very very light coverage and I think the
shade is fine I've used quite a bit of
product so far I feel like the brush is
soaking up a lot less okay so here's
what it looks like with a second layer
more coverage the first layer for sure
but you can still see pretty much all of
my imperfections but it does look like a
nice dewy kind of satin finish sitting
really nice on the skin coverage is
definitely extremely shear this is even
lighter coverage than some BB creams I
own so I think I'm going to go in with
one more round and see if we can build
this a little bit more coverage and go
back with the sponge
okay it's looking a little funky on my
chin my chin right here it looks pretty
dry or something what is going on I
don't know if you guys can see the
texture on camera but it looks pretty
dry around here so the third layer is
looking a little weird I don't know if
it's because the product set it does
feel pretty set on the forehead actually
oh that's kind of nice feels totally set
kind of like clings to certain parts of
my face and looks kind of patchy so
here's what my face looks like with
pretty much three layers of foundation I
would say this is still a very light
coverage even with three layers so this
is not for someone who is looking for
coverage at all I would say this is only
for people who want to even out the skin
tone one super sheer coverage if you
have problem areas that you like
covering up with foundation probably not
for you I'm going to go in with a little
bit of concealer two spot conceal
because I prefer to have a little bit
more coverage and that way we can also
see how concealer and product sits on
top of it so this is the white world
come correct celebrity concealer I don't
like this for under my eyes but it rocks
for spot concealing and for carving out
your eyebrows it creases on me under my
eyes but this says a ton of coverage you
need the tiniest bit and I'm just gonna
come to this on some spots okay I'm
there you go so this is definitely
helping to cover some of the spots I
need more coverage so that gave me some
more coverage I'm going to apply my
under-eye concealer and the rest of my
makeup possibly set my face it does feel
like it fully sets so it's now 8:30 I'm
going to play dress my makeup and I'll
be right back
alright so it's now eight fifty six in
the morning let's call it 9:00 a.m.
right so my makeups on there is some
weird stuff going on in my face right
now you think with the sheer water-based
formula this wouldn't happen but and it
is hard to see under the ring light not
just in my other here doing my makeup
there's some weird dry patches going on
but also just super bizarre clinging to
certain areas like my upper lip looks a
little bit cakey I didn't apply any
powder by the way I only set my under
eye
and the rest is just the foundation I
really feel like I need to set it
because it does feel like it fully sets
which I like and it doesn't transfer so
I have no powder on this area or any of
my face besides my under-eye and it
definitely looks like I do it's clinging
really weird to my upper lip by the way
on my lips right now is the B hue pretty
penny these liquid lipsticks telling you
guys their bum turn down the ring light
so hopefully you guys can see not fully
showing up like it really is in real
life but just looks like dry patches are
coming up in places that I didn't know
they were it's not only where I applied
concealer besides that the rest of my
face right now looks fine and this
highlight secret beam highlighter I
randomly found this on Amazon haven't
heard anything about this before but
this is actually pretty good nice pale
skin highlight okay so like I said it's
nine o'clock I'm going to wear this
throughout the day all right so it's now
1:00 p.m. so the Foundation's been on
for four hours one do this check in and
natural lighting so you guys can see how
it looks and this is the first time I'm
looking at it and after lighting - I'm
literally on my knees on the hardwood
floor right now I'm getting a little
creasing around my mouth area and it
still looks like I have a powder on
there which is just strange for being
80% water it just doesn't look as smooth
and moisturizing as as you would think I
just have certain patches that don't
look that good I'm gonna wear this for a
few more hours I'm just working from
home today so I have the leopard robe on
and just ordered Taco Time story my life
if you've you guys in the other video
said you want me to film the natural
lighting and I wish I could but this
huge window is literally the only place
we get natural light and it's in our
kitchen and living room
my roommate both work from home so that
can't really happen in this apartment
unfortunately but I will continue to
check in enough light all right so it's
now 746 p.m. so the Foundation's been on
for almost 11 hours and for being on for
that long and I was just outside and
it's like 85 degrees I think it held up
pretty well like I said it did use the
setting powder and for not using a
setting powder my forehead and
everywhere it looks like it's on pretty
well I do think it rubbed off a little
bit down here I know I didn't have
coverage down here but just looks like
it has rubbed off a little bit my
forehead looks good considering and the
shade and everything looks nice and
natural lighting so I am happy with the
lasting power of this if you're someone
who wants something that is extremely
sheer light coverage you just want to
even out your skin tone you don't have a
whole lot to cover up or if or maybe you
just want something super lightweight
for the summer if you're going to the
beach or something I do think that this
could be good for you considering how
well it held up
I personally probably won't be reaching
for this too often just because I like
something that has a little bit more
coverage I would use this to shear out a
foundation that is way too thick for my
liking like the Estee Lauder Double Wear
or Kat Von D lock-it tattoo foundation
keeping in mind that this personally
isn't for me someone that has acne and
scarring that they need to cover up I do
think it looks good just not how I would
personally prefer to wear my foundation
on a daily basis so I hope you guys like
this video if you do and you're excited
for 15 days of foundation my leg is
literally cramping right now give this
video a thumbs up don't forget to watch
day 1 through 10 down below and the
playlist love you guys thanks for
