of coffee right now or a shot of tequila
alright so today it is foundation Friday
it is also almost the holidays when you
guys are famous so Merry Christmas Happy
Hanukkah happy whatever you may
celebrate I'm actually going to be home
in San Diego when you guys are seeing
this so if you want to follow along you
follow me on snapchat - taillow snaps my
parents got a new puppy and when I'm
home he literally dominates my snapchat
so if you want to through the cutest dog
alive snapchat super quick feel like I
have to address this here is obviously
different back to dark on top and then I
have some hombre purple gray situation
going on you've already seen all about
the hair it follow me on Instagram
a new hair moving on foundation today
we're going to be talking about the
brand new Maybelline Dream cushioned
fresh face liquid foundation on the go
this is obviously a cushion foundation
in the last year it seems like cushion
foundations have gotten super popular in
the u.s. few drugstore brands have come
out cushion foundations and also
high-end so this product comes in eight
shades the lightest shade is ten
porcelain which I'm using and the
darkest is sixty cocoa I actually have
all eight shades two more I can't hold
to swatch for you retails for $15.99 and
you get zero point five one ounce of the
product in here at the L'Oreal magic
Lumi cushion foundation you get zero
point five to nothing super special
about the packaging normal cushion
foundation packaging that opens you have
your actual cushion products below where
are you doing
have your cushion product in here snap
shut and comes with a little applicator
divorce a certain words and I sound so
wrong applicator yeah applicator so
there are extremely minimal claims on
the Maybelline website about this
product I don't even know if this
qualifies as a claims
doesn't say what kind of coverage this
is supposed to be it literally just says
it's a dream cushion foundation that
delivers complete luminous coverage for
fresh-faced perfection it has how to
apply and that's literally all it says
originally got my shade off of Amazon
I'm going to find it anywhere in
drugstores yep but they do have this on
Amazon and then Maybelline
spending every single shade which is why
I have them all so I can sentiment
swatch every shade for you so you can
see I'm not going to be wasting all
these uppers watch them clean hands and
won't be donating them but do you think
since I have a full collection might be
worth it to swatch the shades alright so
here are the swatches of the cushion
foundations so this is in the shade 10
the lightest shade next over we actually
have 20 because it's watch these two out
of order on accident this is 20 then we
have 15 30 40 45 55 and then 60 which is
the deepest shade and I was actually
able to just watch from the sealants I
didn't even have to actually touch the
cushion so we are good to donate like
normal I am going to swatch the lightest
shade next to some of the other lightest
foundation shades I have okay so now
here is the lightest shade of the
Maybelline Dream cushion foundation next
to some other lightest shades of
foundation right here is the etude house
they cover BB foundation this is the
closest shade match to my skin this is
the Urban Decay Naked Foundation in 0.5
is actually the brand new shade of the
tartrate forces to see the lightest
shade they just came out with this it's
a shade porcelain it is perfection I
love this and so happy they finally came
out with an actual light shade this is a
Josie Maran Argan vibrancy foundation in
0.5 and then this is the lightest shade
of the j-cap Titian foundation it has
everything if you guys want to see my
thoughts on the Maybelline Dream cushion
foundation and how it applies to Mars
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching
ok so I've already watch moisturize
prime my face like usual with my way
into a blemish matte primer so I am
clearly breaking out right now I have
some open acne right here some on the
forehead
scarring the usual so we're going to see
how well this thing covers I'm using my
show you ten porcelain top this guy open
and then take off the seal so what's
cushion foundations when you're done you
always want to snap this completely
closed so air doesn't get in here and
dry it out I'm used to cushion on one
side of my face and then my Beauty
Blender on the other this is the Black
Beauty Blender obviously still don't
like this one better than the Real
Techniques sponge but that's in the
office right now so using this so I'm
just going to stick this thing in here
get a ton of product when you lightly
touch it in there hoping this is light
enough
so now I have a case drawing of a
sentinel actually yeah smells kind of
like mething we going with a tiny bit
more for this half of my forehead shape
is definitely a bit dark I think it's
wearable button to some poulos all the
way down my neck when I'm totally fine
it has a really nice dewy finish right
now coverage not the best coverage with
the cushion it's looking like let's say
high light coverage I mean I'm going to
show you going to close up in a second
but pretty much everything is still
coming through it just kind of helps to
even out my skin tone so let's try the
beauty blender on this side and I'm just
going to put the sponge right in here it
literally took me like 10 minutes to get
this necklace on someone with these
nails so the Beauty Blender is a little
bit quicker application at least for me
and it looks pretty much identical I
think I actually might like this side a
little bit better right now same kind of
finish same exact coverage I mean
everything is pretty much still coming
through
I'm going to go in with the second layer
see if this is buildable at all and see
if we can get a little bit more coverage
of this so I'm going to go in on this
side with the new blender whoo okay it
is building for sure it's looking really
nice and natural in my skin and my pores
actually look really good right now see
if it sets down in a couple minutes but
right now it's looking very dewy with
that second layer though I like the
coverage we're at medium coverage now I
like the tone of it though it doesn't
look warranties the nice beige tone
before I decided I want to powder this I
want to see this kind of sets down right
now it doesn't feel set at all so I'm
going to give it a couple minutes see if
it's set and see if it mattifies it a
little bit but in the meantime I got
this guy this is the L'Oreal blend
artists and fallible concealer blender
this basically looks like a mini Real
Techniques sponge and it's so sweet for
your under-eye concealer so let's try
this out why not got this on Amazon -
this blue color just makes me really
happy this is the perfect flue whose
brand new they also came out with a
contour sponge but ever used cream
contour so
pick that one up so let's put this guy's
my chart shape tanks in the shade there
thank you even lighter shade I picked it
up for chopping office so I'm already
dancing this and I've given my beauty
blender I still get comments being like
why'd you use a dry B blender did it
before y'all let's see how low is to
lens whoo the size of this is nice so
heck yeah and it feel this sponge
it feels really nice and squishy like
the Real Techniques one actually I want
to fill a little bit squishier and
softer than the Real Techniques wedge
and just one who felt really nice I feel
think I get better coverage with my
brush but that could just be me sponges
never give me as much coverage under my
eyes but I really like the size of this
the size of this is perfect for under
the eyes and like the face of sledge
there's also a flat circle edge on the
bottom might believe that for like
center of your forehead down your nose
in your chin I never highlight the
center of my face when I do foundation
videos just they don't want the
concealer to mess it up till days when I
don't want like full full coverage under
my eyes I like this I would say it's
been on for a few minutes now and the
foundation argue looks like it's
starting to oxidize feels like it's
setting a little bit but I definitely
think this is the one I want to set with
the powder it is 851 right now so I'm
going to apply my powder through the
rest of my face and then I'll tell you
guys what I use so it's now 904 let's
call it reckon time nine o'clock so I'm
gonna tell you what's on my face in a
second but let's take a look at the
foundation I did end up setting my face
with cover effect eliminating setting
powder in light because this one helps
to lighten my face a little bit so my
skin is looking really nice the thing
that's great about cushion foundations
that a lot of the time if you have
texture they really help to just kind of
smooth out your skin and it looks almost
like a second skin and that is kind of
what's going on right now
texture on my forehead looks great
around my nose to my pores look really
good right now so this is what it's
looking like up close I feel like it
looks really good on my forehead really
helping with some of my texture and
small bumps I think next time I would
spots and feel even on top of those two
layers just because so my acne spots are
still coming through right now but as
far as how it's sitting on my face
everything looks very nice with the
powder definitely tone
down doing this but you can still see it
coming through my forehead a little bit
and this is an illuminating powder so
makeup on rest my case I use a two-faced
sweet peach glow palette uses brown
shade right here to kind of runs up a
little bit I also use this middle shade
is blush I really like the product but
the smell is like smell is repulsive to
me if you're sensitive to scent this
artificial peach scent is like very
interesting I just kind of breathe
through my mouth when I put this on
target power blush
Haile is our last if he's light mascara
is my normal toothpaste random sex lips
his road dial Melrose abs this is their
sweets lip pencil these are really nice
and then this is the anyway baby pink
luminizing lip gloss I love this thing
it smells really bad it smells very
chemically but I use this in my hidden
drugstore video that I posted this
Monday and I've been using at the time
that loves the shade of this so I think
that's everything on my face I'm calling
a second time nine o'clock have a bunch
of errands to run I have to pack because
in my time I actually leave for
California tomorrow and that check and
idea will be in natural lighting so I
will check back with you guys in a few
hours okay so it's now 146 well you
cannot see anything so it's not even
been on for almost five hours I've got
the leopard robe on and kneeling on the
hardwood floor right now I think it
looks pretty dang good saying I really
like is that my forehead looks very nice
and smooth the finish of it looks very
smooth and just like skin even with the
powder on top of it can get really up
close so you can see I think the shade
is wearable I mean if you look at it
like here's my chest and then here's my
face it doesn't look like holy crap way
too dark but you can definitely see the
difference looks really good on my upper
lip also pretty good around my nose not
any major creasing or anything happening
I'm starting to get slightly oily on my
forehead so I'm hoping we're not a
greaseball by the end of the day it also
feels really nice and natural on my skin
like I don't feel like I have a ton of
foundation on it all I just did that I
don't really see any transfer yeah
nothing's really coming off on my
fingers so 5 hours in I'm liking it I'm
going to go get shit done and I will
check back to you guys in a few hours
alright so it is now 7 o'clock so if
foundation has been on for 10 hours now
I was actually laying
this side of my face because I got a
migraine around 4:00 p.m. so better now
I took one of my migraine pills pills to
pack well let's look at foundationalist
movies to break
so for bing set with a powder I do look
very oily right now on my forehead and
on my chin and round my nose so pretty
much where I normally get oily but this
is like very oily for laying on this
side I feel like it actually held up
pretty well
it didn't really transfer and it didn't
rub off a lot on the side of my face
when I went to lay down at 4:00 p.m. I
looked in the mirror to see how it was
beforehand and it looks really good so
at that point and was looking really
good still and not oily oil aside it
isn't breaking down anywhere it just
looks super oily but around my nose
upper lip and everything still looks
pretty good for ten hours I like the way
this one looks
I don't think is long-lasting on me it's
typically how cushion foundations are
for me if I want them to just put on to
go to a grocery store whatever it is
super quick I would use this I don't
think I'd use and says a long-lasting
bold a kind of foundation if you have
oily or skin than I do since I did set
this and I'm still estoy listo unless
you use like Rimmel stay matte or
something which breaks me out so I can't
use this it does help to control oil
really well use dry skin or mature skin
I think this one could work because it
really did kind of smooth out my texture
it does settle in anywhere I didn't
settle into my upper lip area like some
foundations do and for the most part it
looks really nice and smooth definitely
like this one better than both
physician's formula and the L'Oreal
cushion foundations as far as the Jacob
versus this one I think that one pulls
ahead a little bit for me just because
in the shade I like this one I don't
think it's absolutely incredible but I
also don't hate it so I need to go eat
and pack I'm going to put on a face mask
still trying to get my hands on the next
total cover foundation I think it came
out in Ulta early so I'm gonna try to
find that foundations I will be having
the wet and wild foundation coming out
soon let me know any other foundations
