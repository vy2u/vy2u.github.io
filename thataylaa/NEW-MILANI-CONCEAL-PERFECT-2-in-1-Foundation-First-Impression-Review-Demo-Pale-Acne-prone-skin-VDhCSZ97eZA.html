on toast got the coffee it's a good day
all right so today we are going to be
testing out this guy this is a brand new
Milani conceal and perfect two-in-one
foundation plus concealer is it brand
spankin new I haven't heard anyone talk
about this yet I haven't seen any
reviews on it
so I'm excited to put it to the test I
ordered this from the Milani website
right when I launched I did see they
have it on Walgreens as well if it's
anywhere else online only get down below
be like I can't move my neck when I wear
scarves this retails for $9.99 and you
get one fluid ounce of product which is
standard it has a pump hallelujah I love
this hombre black packaging I feel like
I haven't seen that yet on a foundation
and I think it's really pretty so this
is supposed to be a medium to full
coverage lightweight oil-free long
wearing water resistant and sweat proof
abnormal combo acne prone super
sensitive skin 910 foundations break me
out so I'll have to keep trying this to
see if it breaks me out hopefully
doesn't have the shade zero one creamy
vanilla you guys will see in the demo
when I put this on that this shade is so
freaking dark this is the darkest light
shade I've ever seen in my entire life
so I did have to mix them with the
foundation liner because fail princess
there are 14 shades on mommy's website
it looks like they have a lot of middle
range like a ton of middle range and a
couple dark ones and then clearly their
lightest shade is nowhere near light I'm
excited to see Milani come out with a
foundation I feel like they don't come
out to any new face products so if you
want to see you my thoughts on this
foundation you're in the right place
just keep watching ok so this foundation
is Hello dark this is the shade zero one
creamy vanilla the lightest shade they
make there's no way I'm going to be able
to wear this on its own i've swatched it
like on the side of my face is honestly
ridiculous so i'm going to swatch it for
you guys on my arm just you can see how
dark this is in what world is this the
lightest shade so as you can see there's
no way in hell that that would work on
my skin tone so in order to tries out
and have to use a foundation mixer you
guys know I've used
panic for years now NYX just came out
with a new Pro Foundation mixer a white
foundation mixer halle-fucking-lujah
Thank You NYX
I've been trying it out and have a whole
review on this probably coming soon I
really want to test this out with a
bunch of different products and see how
it works before I do a full review on it
what I have noticed with this so far is
that it does a really good job at not
changing the consistency and formula of
the foundation so I feel like this is a
good one to test out with this
foundation so I'm going to go ahead and
mix on the back of my palette okay bath
&amp;amp; Bodyworks Kindle you say use a dime
sized amount for your whole face but we
all know I got a ton of stuff to cover
up and we're going to be mixing in
something basically cutting this in half
essentially so I am going to add a
little bit more consistency it looks
super thick you can see it's not budging
I'm just gonna squirt some of this in
here mix away looking a lot lighter on
camera than it does in real life this is
a super it's not even like yellow toned
it's kind of straight-up
orange toned foundation so still pretty
dark I think we need a tiny bit more
mixer it feels like it's keeping the
consistency it still feels very thick
and it's mixing in really easily with
this so I'm going to half my face with a
makeup sponge and then half my face with
a brush like they say I'm just going to
take what's on my finger from mixing go
ahead and dab it on yeah we're gonna
start with the brush so I'm using my
favorite Sigma f80 shoes like my holy
grail foundation brush you have a 10%
off Sigma code so check in the
description box still looks like it's
going to be too dark you've been mixing
in a ton of Lightner but I think
it'll be doable once we have concealer
on not that easiest to blend out it
feels a little bit like sticky or
something for primer I am hooked on the
Nivea aftershave balm or whatever post
shave balm as a primer that stuff is
legit it actually works but I didn't
want to use it today because I feel like
it actually makes the foundation stay on
longer so I don't want to like alter the
foundation so today I just used the body
shop teacher your primary because that's
just like a super neutral primer I do
have heat rashes on
for my hot pack those aren't like
hickeys or anything so I've just been
like blood thin foundation over them
looks like a nice medium coverage I feel
like this will be buildable semi
luminous finish so let's do side of the
forehead okay so here is half of my face
okay so I'm going to go in with the
other half and this is a sponge by pure
cosmetics I love this sponge I mentioned
this one in my erase and rejects videos
it has this flat edge like the Real
Techniques one and I feel like this is
like a perfect hybrid of the Beauty
Blender and the Real Techniques sponge
this is like my favorite sponge if you
want a cheaper alternative the Real
Techniques button is pretty dang close
I like the Real Techniques sponge a lot
better than the Beauty Blender so it's
blowing out a lot quicker and easier but
I feel like we're getting less coverage
for sure and I have a lot less to cover
up on this side too and it's definitely
giving less coverage so if you like I
had a ton of product on here and it is
completely gone someone have to mix some
more okay so I'm just putting on a
little bit more we're going to see if
this is buildable and how much more
coverage we can get and I'm gonna be
using the brush for this since it does
have better coverage with the brush for
sure how's it that this can't help I'm
smelling my brush because I just washed
them or the foundation I don't think we
got that much more coverage I'll see you
guys in at the end we could definitely
still see some acne down here but the
finish looks nice it doesn't look cakey
or anything it has a nice like satin
finish my pores don't look super
emphasized or anything um it definitely
looks like I'm wearing makeup like this
isn't one of those like full coverage
foundations that makes you look like
you're not like I definitely have makeup
on my face right now so I'm going to
blend this down my neck because it
definitely is still too dark okay so
here's a close-up of the foundation so
far I do like it I think it looks nice I
like the finish of it no complaints so
far other than you can still kind of see
some acne down here if you weren't using
a foundation mixer
it might have fuller coverage Marda
getting some pickiness around my nose so
I'm going to apply the rest of my makeup
and then we will be right back okay rest
of my makeup is on don't you love it
when you're like feeling your makeup and
then you get mascara all over your face
so on my face I use the Kat Von D
contour shade and light palette urban
decay blush I guess that's the bronzer
oh I mix these two for blush and then
I'm wearing the elf illuminating palette
for my highlight which I've been in love
with I think I've almost worn it every
single day this month super pretty pale
highlight if you have pale skin like
look at that what else
Oh lips are Stila stay all day caramel
oh it is 11:10 a.m. so I'm just going to
be running errands Inger might be going
out tonight so we'll see how long I can
keep this on but it should be a good
like at least eight hours I don't know
we'll see how it wears I didn't use a
setting powder because I just want to
see how it looks on its own we shall see
i'ma show you guys what looks like in
natural lighting okay so here we are in
natural lighting actually like this
lighting a lot better right now why
aren't you filming out here yeah what
the heck you like it usually doesn't
want this good natural lighting anyways
I'm going to take off the scarf so you
can see here's my natural Hale self and
then it doesn't want too bad actually
with all the time and foundation
mixer
I will check back in throughout the day
I'm gonna go get coffee gonna go get
some license plates okay so it is 212 in
the afternoon so it's been off for three
hours now this camera weighs like 10
pounds this is the fun workout don't
judge my messy room the background about
to full laundry I'm filming in front of
my window which this is why I don't film
in natural lighting in my room because
this window doesn't let in like any
light I wanted to show you guys in this
lighting because you get kind of a
better idea of what it actually looks
like in real life versus under the
lights so far I think it looks pretty
good I'm my only complaint as I'm
starting to get creasing right here if
you guys can see looking in the mirror
no their major complaints is holding up
pretty well looks good on the forehead
still my only complaint is that I can
totally feel it on my face like it's one
of those foundations that you can
definitely feel it kind of feels like
I've like glue on my face you can
definitely feel this one so I'm going to
check back in a few hours and we will
how it's holdin up okay so it is now
5:30 p.m. I just plugged in my phone so
you're just gonna have to take my word
for it so the Foundation's been on for
six hours now at the leopard robe on for
being on for six hours only
it looks pretty freakin oily I feel like
in the last two hours especially like
between my last check and now it got way
Olli I didn't feel like this is going to
be one of those foundations that did
that just a consistency like putting it
on it didn't feel like it was going to
be one of those conditions it got super
oily but like I said in the intro I of
combo skin so getting a little bit oily
as normal for me but this is like whoa
definitely lines around my nose area in
my mouth zoomin UNT and see the texture
and everything but yes super oily like
around here on my nose on my forehead
pretty much everywhere as you can see
it's not looking the cutest around my
nose my forehead is just straight-up
shiny and I do think it oxidized a
little bit as well so I decided that I'm
not going out tonight story of my life
overall thoughts not super excited about
it I might try mixing it in with a
lighter long-lasting foundation and see
how it wears if you have pale skin
definitely don't buy this like don't
even try it's not even worth trying to
mix if you don't have pale skin I still
don't think I would recommend this I
think there are better drugstore
foundations trying maybelline superstay
that is like one of my favorite full
coverage long-lasting drugstore
foundations isn't pale enough for pale
skin but I used to wear it when I was
elf tan if you guys liked this video
give it a thumbs up so I know
thumbs up for leper groves love you guys
thanks for watching see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
