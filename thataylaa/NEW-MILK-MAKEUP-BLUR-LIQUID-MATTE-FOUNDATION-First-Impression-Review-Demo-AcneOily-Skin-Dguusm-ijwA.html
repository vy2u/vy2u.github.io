you say literally just need you to chill
for the intro please alright so today it
is foundation fries as I do a new first
impression video every single Friday on
my channel super excited we're talking
about this thing just wants to be free
this is a brand new foundation by milk
makeup I was super intrigued by this
because pretty much the claims are like
exactly what I would describe my perfect
foundation to be I haven't had good luck
with milk makeup products in the past I
actually can't really think of one that
I like so this is a new product we'll
see how it is there something about the
name of this brand though that I love I
don't know if it's just because I love
milk or I love their font I want to know
the story behind this brand because I
just think it's so great to someone
named a makeup brand milk can we be
friends
you get one fluid ounce of product in
here which is standard for foundation
but it retails for $40 so this is not a
cheap foundation you get milk makeup on
Sephora let's read some of the claims it
says it's a full coverage water thin
foundation that provides a weightless
long wear matte finish silicone free
formula won't clog pores supposed to
blur minimize the appearance of pores
fine lines and perfections cruelty-free
vegan made in the US silicone freedom
Ethicon free so I mean this sounds like
heaven they launched this foundation
with 16 shades I the lightest shade
which is fair the description on fair
says fair with pink undertones and the
deepest shade says deep with neutral
undertones so I'm gonna start swatches
right here so you can see how this shade
compares to some of the other foundation
shades I have use
whoops alright so swatch time right here
is a milk makeup foundation in the
lightest shade next over is pur
cosmetics bear a tall and porcelain next
that's derma called 2:08 Maybelline fit
me matte and poreless in 110 I actually
really hate this foundation I just
include this in swatches because it's a
drugstore foundation that a lot of
people know the shade FF try it out so
you can compare it to that and then last
is Urban Decay Naked Foundation and 0.5
those are all the claims on this guy I
always have my foundation Friday
playlist linked down below if you want
to watch past foundation Fridays but if
you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up super
quick to second announcement for you
guys before jump into it the next 15
days of foundation Series dates will be
announced in next week's foundation
Friday video
super excited that's coming up super
soon now dates will be announced in next
week's video if you want to see how the
milk makeup blur liquid is done and you
say that this is the milk makeup blur
liquid matte foundation that's great
intro if you want see out applies and
wear throughout the day you're in the
right place just keep watching alright
so right now it's a 908 oh and my phone
is charging in the wall so wash
moisturize I'm priming my face with my
usual which will be linked down below in
the description box but we're going to
go in with the foundation I have a
TaskRabbit coming in like an hour to
help me put together something so so I
really enjoy this packaging I feel like
this is one of my favorite foundation
packaging is in a while I don't know
what it is about it but it almost looks
like it's like an art piece on display
or something I have a full description
of what the foundation is on the back
here which is also nice so have the
shade fair you guys will have already
seen swatches but I have not literally
everything that this says it is is very
appealing to me like that's exactly what
I wanted foundation so I'm super curious
about this I'm going to give it a little
shake just in case I tried to scrub off
all the fake tan that I had on this
morning I think there's still a tiny
tiny bit but this is pretty close to my
normal skin tone so everything I thought
this was going to have like a click top
but it's actually twist off the bit
thinner than I was expecting just looks
like kind of a normal liquid foundation
consistency it is running a tiny bit I
would you have my face my sponge I
always use and then the other half with
either the morphe 31 or this elf
ultimate blending brush I kind of trap
this elf one it's a little bit more
flimsy than what I usually like this one
is definitely more dense that might rain
about that I don't know but let's try
out the sponge first on the side of my
face
I live got a lot to cover up down here
right now says it's full coverage
I brought my coffee cup heat warmer
thing in from the office base ahead in
here so now my coffee is permanently hot
best decision I ever made
boo off the bat whoa looks like skin
that looks really nice it almost looks
like a silicon-based foundation and I
used like not even a third of the amount
that I squeezed out and that went pretty
far the shade looks pretty spot-on maybe
it's half a shade too light right now
but when the rest of the Tanner comes
off I think this would be perfect
I didn't have to go back in with product
the amount that I squeezed out that you
guys saw worked for half my face but
this does seem to be full coverage with
that sponge that looks that looks good
okay let's see how it does with the
brush on the other side I'm wondering if
it's going to dry down totally matte
because right now it actually looks like
more of a satin finish which I like ooh
feels really lightweight definitely
isn't set down that just totally
transferred but it feels super
lightweight on my skin I don't know why
I'm really drawn to this brush right now
I want to try out this brush yes so
definitely more of a flimsy brush then i
usually use cou look at that it smells
like oranges yeah it smells very citrusy
I'm not usually a citrus scent kind of
person but I don't mind it just smells
kind of refreshing dude that looks nice
I like how it's applying with this brush
too like I'm getting actually a tiny bit
better coverage on the brush side but I
think it looks nice on both yeah this
one I did get better coverage for sure
the tone of this and everything I'm
really into right now I hope this isn't
oxidized I mean damn like there's
nothing to complain about right now it
looks really good around my nose the
center of my forehead
it doesn't look matte though even on
this side where it's been on for
probably a couple minutes now this side
of my face with the brush I don't feel
like I need to do a second layer build
anything up at all so like I got great
coverage this side down here I do want
to see if I can get a little bit more
coverage so I'm going to go in with just
a super tiny amount and that brush feels
great it almost looks like the ordinary
foundation but better coverage and
hopefully it doesn't look like pure
in an hour but the way that this is
sitting on my skin kinda reminds me that
at this point right now I am loving this
I'm impressed this is rare not clinging
anywhere it looks beautiful right now I
don't know if I want to set this I don't
set every foundation with powder I have
certain sound ations that definitely on
my skin with a texture wear and look a
lot better throughout the day without
powder and vice versa so it really just
depends on the product I kind of just go
by feel since this is supposed to be
long wearing and matte I kind of want to
see how it just wears throughout the
dance so
it also feels nice and almost like dry
to the touch I could easily blend
product on top of this right now I think
it is still transferring now so if
transfer really bothers you this is
definitely transferring when I just
touch my face
setting could potentially help with the
transfer right now it's 9:20 I'm going
to do the rest my makeup decide if I
want to do a powder at all and I'll be
right back right so it's now 9:50 so
it's been on for about a half hour we're
going to call the second time 9:30 since
that's pretty much when I finished up
with my face makeup I did not end up
setting this I did use a tiny bit of
powder just whatever was left over from
my under eyes I just put it on the
center of my face but I didn't do like a
full-on all-over face powder I think the
one thing I wouldn't agree with as far
as claims on this foundation is matte it
doesn't look matte at all to me I mean
my forehead is pretty duty right now
you're like a matte matte kind of person
and you're buying this for that reason
this one isn't totally matte but it
looks frickin gorgeous every time I go
to grab a product and then come back to
the mirror I would just like stare at my
skin because it looks so good right now
I'm really hoping this way as well
throughout the day because right now I'm
in love with it but we will see I did a
clip in natural lighting I'm going to
start it right here so you guys can see
what it looks like okay I need to show
you guys it's magic right now in natural
lighting this is right after I just
applied it it's been on for about 20
minutes now and I mean look at my skin
right now I have a ton of texture
and it just kind of like smoothed
everything over and now looking pretty
sad and almost do at this point right so
the rest of my face I tried to use the
bronzer from the Becca Chrissy Teigen
palette which was kind of a fail on my
skin tone it's just straight up orange
that's the bronzer shade but I did end
up using this highlight shade I also
used a Becca rose quartz highlight I
just kind of topped the Chrissy Teigen
one off with this after trying the Becca
bronzer I went in with this flower
Beauty bronzer right here the shade this
is medium to deep oh they're light one
just a kind of basic eye makeup and not
trying to have a full-on smoky eye for
this TaskRabbit coming is the morphe 25b
palette and on lips i use lancome 9 min
time to say this
2:02 pretty sheer which is just like a
peachy kind of nude and then i top that
off with mac lipglass when was the last
time I used a freaking Mac lip gloss I
feel like that was in like sixth grade
this is in the shade mists
I really like this I feel like they
reformulated these a little bit because
they're much more comfortable than I
remember they're not like super sticky
and I think that's everything went in
with my normal mascaras which will be
listed down below so next check and I do
will be an actor lighting I'm also
vlogging today I'm like 90% done
finishing up organizing this makeup room
and then I'm going to have a full
apartment where I know some of you guys
have been asking about that apartment
tour will be coming this was like the
last room and then the thing the task
scrap is doing today is like the last
steps before it's done I'll see you guys
a few hours okay so it's now 3 20s it's
been on for 6 hours starting to feel
crappy again so I'm going to make this a
quick check-in but clearly I am looking
very oily the foundation itself actually
still looks really good it's not like
creasing anywhere taking up I'm just a
Lee so I'm actually going to try
blotting I never really blotch but we're
going to try it out so I have these
papers how am I going to hold the camera
do this at the same time one thing I
noticed for sure is that this transfers
I'm actually really curious to see how
much of the foundation comes off on here
and how much of just my oil when I
leaned my hand on my face it full-on
came off on my hand so this is
definitely not transfer proof at all ok
unless I can do this extras one hand we
ride a weird ankle but I'm going to try
and blot I have my mirror
look you guys can see that but
definitely taking off a lot of my oil I
try a little bit more on my forehead so
it's still looking really oily up here
definitely didn't take off all the
foundation and helped to take off them
my oil but I feel like every time I try
to blot it it doesn't look that much
better
I never blot I'm gonna go get a powder
and I think I'm going to powder my face
because this is a foundation I can tell
that I would need to powder my face list
since I'm this oily six hours in I still
like the way the actual foundation is
looking though like it looks good it has
increased or anything I'm just a li so
I'm going to go grab powder and you're
back okay so I'm going to powder my face
with the Laura Geller balance and
alright Brighton powder and I'm just
going to do the center of my face see if
this helps with the oil situation for
the rest of the night alrighty that's
looking better okay now that I've
blotted and added some powder it looks
really good and it looks like I just put
the foundation on now so here it is
after six hours after touching up with
powder so I'm going to keep wearing this
throughout the night obviously and I'll
see you guys in two hours
so it is now 753 so it's been on for
almost ten and a half hours let's take a
look up close I am really oily like my
oil just keeps coming through with this
thing I'm kind of shocked and still this
oily even after blotting and powdering
just a few hours ago that being said
it's still not breaking down which I
like like the actual foundation is still
holding up tried to figure out a good
primer and powder with this that kept me
the most Matt I think I would really
like this because I love fact that it
hasn't broken down I love just how it
looks on my skin it doesn't look heavy
or cakey anywhere and that's rare for me
it also isn't majorly creasing like on
my upper lip or anything and for being
on for ten and a half hours my forehead
and everything look pretty good for me
so I definitely don't think this one was
match at all even on the gecko
you're dry or normal this one actually
might work out really well for you if
you're a more oily like I and they'll
just have
by something that works I do think it's
oxidized a little bit it's a tiny bit
hard to tell you kind of see on my neck
right here but I just went outside to
get my post nice I saw my reflection in
a window and I definitely looked like my
face was darker than my neck so I think
it has oxidized a little bit because I
think when I first put on it looked a
little bit light so just keep that in
mind but overall I think this carnation
is really nice
interesting Emily alright guys so I have
it on a different day and I'm wearing
the foundation with the Maybelline fit
me loose powder in the shade 5 overtop
of it 3 o'clock right now I put it on
that 8 a.m. this morning this is six
hours of wear and as you can see I'm
much less oily it looks frickin
beautiful really liked it with this
powder it just went on beautifully this
morning and it's wearing really well so
I'm liking this milk thing fuel in it so
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you

excited for next week's foundation
