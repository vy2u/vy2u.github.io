need these absolutely not the lighting
in this corner versus my normal corner
is like a whole new world so today we're
going to be talking about the new
Maybelline limited edition pink
collection Baby Lips I'm not gonna lie I
am not normally part of the Baby Lips
cult but it said limited edition so I
felt like the world was going to end if
I didn't pick them up consumerism 5 Baby
Lips is quite the challenge to hold in
one hand so there are five colors in the
pink collection I'm going to go through
and talk about them as we try them on
for the first time together it says
there's a tower moisture and there's
shea butter vitamin E and it's supposed
to be just a tinted moisturizer lip balm
there's point zero one five ounces of
product in each Baby Lips these retail
between about three and five dollars
depending on where you get them I would
definitely suggest Walmart because they
retail for 297 there I picked them up at
Rite Aid for almost five dollars each
which it was a little ridiculous in my
opinion for a chapstick Rite Aid is
having a Maybelline buy one get one free
right now so if you want to try these
out you could also go that route you can
say route or route so I'm just gonna
start with the lightest and then go to
the darkest because that would be
illogical okay so clearly taking off my
lipstick and I'm going to start out with
number 105 blush first which is upside
down which is the lightest shade in the
collection
Mel's just like generic candy let's
apply this baby
okay so as you can see there's virtually
no color in this one the colors very
faint it does have a little bit of
shimmer to it feels nice on the lips I
feel like this would just be a good
everyday chapstick to like throw in your
purse when you don't really want any
kind of color on your lips 115 and 110
look pretty similar to me I can't really
tell which ones lighter so I'm gonna go
with 110 to begin ooh I like this one
this is pretty pigmented
as you can see it's kind of a light
bubblegum pink color I'm actually a very
large fan of this color next we're gonna
do 115 mad for magenta I think they all
smelled exactly the same I've just
concluded
not what I was expecting not quite as
pigmented as 110 it has a nice kind of
natural pink color and I like the color
of this one the best looks like a
watermelon istic next we're going with
125 Very Berry
Oh hells yeah this is another one that's
definitely on the more pigmented side
for a chapstick these are kind of
amazing I might be a part of the cult
like this one will be nice for the
spring and summer times as it is a
little bit more bright then the last one
is 120 Rose rush which looks like this
I feel like this one has a different
smell this one kind of smells like sour
generic candy
so here is rose rush um I don't know I
think this one's kind of mediocre it
kind of looks like a few of the others
this is kind of between a fuchsia and
the bubblegum pink one I could probably
go without this one in my life so if you
want to see swatches for the Baby Lips
pink collection you can click my blog
