times I say that line before we get a
winner so today we are reviewing the
brand-new Maybelline Dream pure BB cream
this has been out I think in the UK and
possibly Canada for a few months now but
we just got it in America I actually
ordered online about four weeks ago as
soon as I saw Maybelline tweet about it
I was like I gotta have this so I went
on an eBay hunt and I ordered this stuff
online I've tried it out a few times now
I haven't worn it more than that and I
will tell you why here we go if you want
to see a get ready with me shadow and
schmooze video on the look I'm wearing
right now make sure you subscribe
because it will be coming up next all I
did in this video was change the lip
color I'm wearing milania's best red
which is one of my all-time favorite
matte red shades so this was a kind of
sequel to the original Maybelline BB
cream which was pretty much an epic fail
they did reformulate it for oily skin
and they added 2% salicylic acid so it's
supposed to treat your acne at the same
time as being a BB cream and giving you
a light sheer tint like they say so to
give you a little bit of background
about my skin before I talk about
product I have normal combination skin
at the moment it's more on the normal
side I have super acne prone skin about
eight out of ten foundations will break
me out so keep that in mind when I'm
talking about this I've heard very mixed
reviews on this I think it really
depends on your skin type and how much
coverage you like and things like that
so just take this video with a grain of
skull which I just not speak today so
just take this with a grain of salt
because what might work for you doesn't
work for me so who knows so the BB cream
comes in five shades which is pretty
horrible their light shade is not close
to light enough for my skin but it's
supposed to adjust to your skin tone
that's one of the things that it says to
do I don't think it's like crazy dark on
my skin tone but it's definitely not as
light as I would like it to be I'm not
wearing it right now I'm wearing a full
coverage foundation right now but I will
be showing you a demo throughout this
video of what it looks like when I apply
it eight claims are that it's supposed
to clear acne conceal imperfection
minimize pores reduce redness adjust to
skin tone hydration smooth
hands and clarify and it has 0% oils and
it supposed to have a lightweight feel
for me one of the big things why I will
not be using this again and I regret the
decision of purchasing this is because
it majorly broke me out my skin has been
completely clear for over a month now
this was the only thing different I did
in my routine I got a super bad cystic
acne again on my chin my forehead behind
the bangs I don't know if it's slowly
this product but most BB creams I've
tried caused me to severely break out so
that might just be my skin it obviously
has salicylic acid in it so it's
supposed to be good for acne prone skin
but for me there's something in it that
just completely did not agree with my
skin so that's why I'm not wearing it in
this video after the demo I literally
just washed it right off because I
didn't want it to pause another mountain
range of acne on my chin so I don't
think you need to have oily skin to use
this product I've heard people with dry
skin talked about it I have normal skin
and it applied fine
for me it's not something that you use
on daily basis just because I like more
coverage but I have mixed it in with my
Revlon Colorstay and it looked really
nice mixed in with a foundation it's
definitely more of a light to medium
coverage like I said I have acne acne
scarring freckles all of that good stuff
so I definitely think that this is more
on the light coverage side obviously if
you don't have those things it's going
to look more medium to full coverage on
your skin which I've heard people
talking about but for me it's definitely
more light coverage I don't think it
covered up my acne it definitely kind of
blurred out things and covered a little
bit of the redness like it says it
should I wish they would have put SPF in
it most BB creams have SPF especially
for the summer if you're only going to
be putting on a tinted moisturizer or BB
cream you definitely wanted to have SPF
in it so protects you from the Sun this
doesn't have SPF another downside as far
as oil control if you have super oily
skin I don't think it's going to control
your oil very well I started to get a
little bit oily on on my chin and around
my nose nothing crazy but if you have
super oily skin you probably wouldn't
want to use this for me I will be
returning this stuff if it didn't break
me out I'd probably keep it and keep
mixing it in with different foundations
but I would definitely not wear it alone
just for what I like
where on my face on a daily basis I
don't know mixed feelings if you're
curious about this stuff I think it's
worth trying out you can always keep
your receipt or return it if you get it
from a drug store hope it doesn't cause
you cystic acne like it did to me
because I have graduation tomorrow and
now it kind of sucks ass because I
literally have volcanic acne on my chin
right now if you have tried this stuff
let me know what you think of it down
below curious to know what you guys
think so that was my review on the
Maybelline Dream pure BB cream if you
guys liked this video and it was helpful
