today we are going to be talking about
this guy this is the Maybelline master
contour face contouring kit comes with a
contour shade blush and a highlight and
this retails for over Jersey details for
about between nine and twelve dollars
depending on where you can find it
seattle drugstores tend to be a little
bit late to the game so i ended up
actually ordering this online CVS so
there are tons of new drugstore products
out right now i'm gonna be doing i think
a whole haul video of all the stuff I
just got why did I just say haul with
like a Hebrew accent oh super exciting I
don't know why all the brand's launched
like ten new products at the same time
but I feel like there was nothing new at
the drugstore for a while and then all
of a sudden it was like Disneyland I
have the Maybelline vivid matte liquid
lipsticks right here to let me know if
you guys would want to see a whole
review on those but getting into this
product so for nine dollars you
basically get three different products
so this is about three dollars per
product like I said you get a blush
punch or highlight and then you get this
brush which is probably the most useless
thing on planet earth I don't know why
they didn't just save their ten cents
and not put a brush in I don't know who
would actually contour with this like
maybe for like a Barbie doll yeah I
don't know it could be an eye brush but
it just feels like the bristles are
super cheap and kind of stiff and this
will be going in the trash in fact let's
just do that right now so as far as the
actual packaging is pretty cheap plastic
packaging there's no mirror on here that
doesn't actually bother me I'd rather
them lower the price a little bit and
not include a mirror the no mirror
factor is not a big deal to me this
shade did come out for me it's starting
to pop out right here which just means
that the glue is a little bit weak so
I'm wearing all three on my face right
now I did do a little demo application
for you guys so you can see how they go
on let's go into the demo okay so I'm
gonna start out by taking the contour
shade right here my favorite contour
brush is a Sedona lace II no 850 you
need the tiniest bit of this I got way
too much on my brush the other day
thing I like about this is that you can
have a really faint contour really
intense contour depending on how much
you apply and kind of how you apply it
if you wanted a really natural contour
you got just sculpted my cheekbones but
you can barely tell that I'm wearing
contour powder so I'm going to apply a
little bit more and just build it up so
we can see it's definitely not as cool
toned as like the cosmetics my sculpt a
face palette that's like my Holy Grail
contour palette this definitely has a
little bit more warmth to it but it's
not too much where it's like orange so
there's our contour I really like it I'm
feeling it next I'm going to go into
blush shade right here which I love
favorite Real Techniques multitasks
brush I mentioned this in my December
reason rejects this blush is pretty
pigmented so I'm just taking a tiny bit
and putting it on the apples of her
cheeks blends out easily
I think this is a super flattering shade
it kind of reminds me of the wet and
wild pearlescent pink blush just blends
out like 50 times easier and it's just
easier to work with so we're gonna go
with the highlight shade right here
which is beautiful this is the Sigma
cheekbone highlight brush fo3 so I'm
just gonna go ahead get some product tap
it off so pretty not chalky really nice
consistency I'm gonna apply a tiny bit
on my nose and then on the bridge so I
just did the rest of my makeup and I did
smudge this shade on the bottom lash
line mixed in with some black and then I
also put it in the crease blend it out
super easily you could totally use this
as an eyeshadow I've used this a few
days now and overall thoughts I'm super
pleased with it the contour shade I've
heard mixed reviews on for me I feel
like it works it's not the coolest shade
ever invented for contour but it's not
too warm and as far as a drugstore
contour this is definitely the closest
thing I feel like I've come to an actual
contour shade if you have pale skin you
can lightly apply this and you'll still
get a contour in the demo I kind of
showed you what it looks like which is a
super light dusting of it the blush
shade is beautiful I love the shade I
feel like it's a really nice rosy pink
kind of shade all of these feel super
soft super buttery really nice
consistency they're not powdery at all
super pleased with the formula the
highlight shade in here is beautiful
it's a really nice champagne light shade
I've nothing negative to say about the
highlight shade I think it's absolutely
beautiful I did try it on my inner
corner today as an inner corner
highlight it wasn't the best for the
inner corner it lasts really well
throughout the day yesterday were on top
of the Maybelline Dream velvet
foundation which I'm testing out to
review I did you a quick like snapchat
review of both of these so if you're not
following me on snapchat you should
other than having slightly cheap
packaging there's really nothing
negative I can say about this I'm super
pleased with it I did order the L'Oreal
contour powder so we'll see how that
compares
so far super happy with this if you guys
try this out let me know what you think
of it you guys like this video and you
like these quick review style videos
give it a thumbs up so I know love you
guys thanks for watching see you my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
