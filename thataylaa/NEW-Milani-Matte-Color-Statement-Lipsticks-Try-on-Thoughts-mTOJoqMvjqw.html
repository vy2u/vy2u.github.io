to spend the night then with my two
loves in life makeup anyway I was trying
to gaze on with the remote way to amused
alright so today we're gonna talk about
the brand new Milani color statement
matte lipsticks I have ten of them here
how do I show these so I have ten of
them here to show you guys I'm gonna try
them on and just talk about it and what
I think of them I do have some new glam
teddy in the background that's its
official name let me know what you guys
think of the background I don't know
what's going on in this corner I think
it's like reflecting off one of the
sparkly things and making it like just
white which I kind of like I don't know
let me know what you guys think of like
the green I might just take off the teal
ones and keep the silver and white your
nose alright so I'm just going to start
off with the one that's on my lips right
now this is the shade
maybe I should like talk about them
first I don't know Taylor maybe so use a
retail for about five to seven dollars
you can get them at Walgreens online for
like 550 you can also get them on the
Milani website I haven't seen them in
stores anywhere Milani did send these to
me to try out well leave the links down
below for where you can order them
online first shade is what I'm wearing
on my lips right now and this is the
shade 61 matte naked this is like a
beautiful deep nude color if you've seen
any of my most recent videos I've
probably mention this this was in my
favorites video and it was also in my
last shadow choice get ready with me
video this has been literally what I've
been wearing every single day for the
past probably three weeks I wear every
single day to work and it's just the
perfect like neutral color for my lips
but it still makes me look like I have
some kind of lipstick on but not like
too much for work you know I'm saying
just the perfect nude shade and I feel
like I've been looking for a shade like
this for forever and I finally found it
the majority of these feels super nice
and creamy on lips especially for a
matte lipstick they're not super
long-lasting when I wear this to work I
do reapply it around like lunchtime
after I be in it stays on while I drink
coffee and stuff but after I have food
it's definitely not on there anymore so
just keep that in mind so this is an X
shape this is sixty matte innocence if
your complexion is any darker than mine
this will probably look like
why on you it is pulling a little bit
darker just cuz I just had that darker
new trade on by the way these smell
amazing I can't even put my finger on it
it's like a little bit of cake vanilla
and something else can't see where I'm
in focus
hopefully it's here so this is 60 Matt
innocence so here is 45 catwalk pink I
did have to layer this one a few times
and it doesn't look or like feel matte
at all to me this is definitely more of
a satin finish I do like it though if
you want like an intense beam gel pen
this is 62 matte blissful it's a nice
pinky purple color I don't know if you
guys can tell on camera but the finish
of this one is definitely more matte
than the last one still feel super nice
and creamy so there's a bunch of bright
up shades that are coming up so this is
a shade 46 power pink I actually really
like this one
again this definitely doesn't look matte
to me this one is more of a satin finish
highs that cool tone in it so will make
your teeth look whiter which everyone
likes alright so this is the shade 63
matte diva the application is just
getting Messier Messier more time goes
on and more one as far as I can tell
this looks pretty similar to power pink
it's just more matte this is just a nice
super bright matte fuchsia color
definitely bright the roof in my mouth
it's hard eating frozen pizza alright so
this is a shade 64 matte orchid dye just
apply this no this looks really similar
has a little bit more purpley berry
tones in it but it looks pretty similar
Wow just ignore the application
good job Taylor excited for this one oh
hell yeah this is the shade 66 matte
passion it's like this burnt not burnt
it's like this morons fiery red color
orange is such a strange word to say
it's like moist I really like this I
think this is one of those colors that
would look great on like tan skin in the
summer I don't know what fair skinned
you can pull it off but I kind of like
it
this is disgusting this is 65 matte glam
I'm all about this shade I think this is
a really pretty purple tone I think this
will look pretty over my pretty zombie
cosmetics
is a pretty if you're in the market for
a nice purple color I would try this one
out I don't know if my lips are just
like raw right now or if this feels kind
of minty something is stinking fun fact
I get chronic hiccups always edit them
out this is a shade 67 matte confident
application on this one is just new low
lip ring just wasn't having it and then
throw off the rest of my games pretend
like it's in the lines on my lips this
is a really nice deep red color I think
it's looking a little bit brighter with
the lights and it does in real life I
like this one alright so that was my
quick swatches and chit chat on the new
Milani matte color statement lipsticks
if you guys liked this video and you
want to see more try on swatch videos
then give it a thumbs up so I know let
me know what you think of the background
and if I should chop off the mint ones
or if you like him I hope you guys had a
lovely Valentine's Day whatever that
means for you love you guys thanks for
watching and see you in my next video
