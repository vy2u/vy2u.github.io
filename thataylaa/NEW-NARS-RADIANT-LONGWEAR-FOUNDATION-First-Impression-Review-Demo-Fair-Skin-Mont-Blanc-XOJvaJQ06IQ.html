bit tea or something
all right so today it is foundation
Friday this is where I try out a new
foundation every single Friday on my
channel I'm gonna have my foundation
Friday playlist linked down below in the
description box if you want to go watch
any others feels weird starting it off a
little different today I usually do a
full face at the beginning like I said
in Monday shadowing schmooze I'm gonna
be switching it up doing some like this
at the beginning doing something like I
usually do try new things so if you
enjoy this video while you're watching
don't forget to give it a thumbs up if
you're new here you can join the burrito
family and subscribe I upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific
time so today we're gonna be trying out
the brand new NARS radiant long wear
foundation this has 1 fluid ounce of
product in here in this foundation
retails for $49
I guess sheer glow is also 47 so there's
only a couple dollars more than sheer
glow some reason I thought a nice sheer
glow was a lot cheaper than that let's
take this guy out of the packaging I
haven't watched any videos on this nice
tall sleek kind of bottle definitely a
lot thinner than this guy see if there's
a pump please beat them yeah I'm gonna
quickly read some of the claims on altos
website just so we know what I'm putting
on my face it says there's long-wear and
then there's strong my again it's gonna
be a good one
the first 16-hour fade-resistant
foundation that improves skin by the
hour and stays true it says that the
skin recognition pigments match your
skin tone delivering your most authentic
coverage yet full coverage never masks
skin masks never masks skin stays
breathable unstoppably natural-looking
and it comes in 33 shades so I have two
shades in sheer glow here I have light
one which is Siberia and then light to
Mont Blanc and I'm kind of a mix between
these two shades this one is a little
bit light and much too yellow the Mont
Blanc has the right undertones to it but
it's a tiny bit dark so for this
foundation it seemed like some of the
shades were the same but then they also
switched it up a little bit so the
lightest shade and this one is actually
called Oslo and it's fair with pink
undertones and then the second lightest
shade light too is Mont Blanc light with
pink undertones which is what I ended up
picking up so I'm gonna search Watchers
right here of the two shades I have in
sheer glow with some other foundations
compared to Mont Blanc in this guy
all right so swatch time right here is a
new NARS radiant foundation in the shade
L to Montblanc next over is the NARS
sheer glow foundation in the same shade
Montblanc
I feel like this one definitely oxidized
more when I first put it on it was a bit
lighter and much more pink and it's
already darkened quite a bit it looks
darker than the shade now next over is
NARS sheer glow in Siberia the lightest
shade L one here we have Laura Geller
cover lock in porcelain dermal called
2:08 my closest shade match and Too
Faced Born This Way and snow alright
hope I didn't forget to say anything cuz
I can't go back and add it in after have
makeup on now that's another reason why
I like doing it the other way if I
forget to say something in the intro I
can add it in at the end plop it in you
know so ready wash moisturize and
prepped my skin I'm gonna have my skin
prep products I've been using link down
below I also just did a full skincare
routine dry skin and for those of you
who are new here I'm currently on almost
month for three and a half of accutane
my skin is a bit drier but right now I
would say it's just kind of normal
I'm not having any major dry patches or
anything new lenses on if you've been
watching my Monday and Wednesdays video
you know I've been trying to play around
with everything I think it's been two
hours this morning trying to figure this
thing out and get it right it's sitting
on three boxes currently but I can zoom
in so let me know what you think do you
like this better than the old lens I use
can you see more as per usual I'm gonna
do one half of my face with the sponge
just as the Ecotools sponge and then the
other half with a brush this is the
morphe 56 because this is the only clean
foundation brush I have right now right
now it's 10 oh just turned 10 50 10 50
in the morning that does say shake well
in the back it does say it's supposed to
be full coverage so I'm gonna start out
with a brush on this side of my face
whoo I'm excited
woah woah this is going really far looks
nice and glowy that shade actually looks
pretty dang perfect going on it feels
very smooth it almost has like a velvety
kind of texture that really looks
radiant which I love I think it just
looks very healthy looks a little bit
clingy around my nose area and on top of
my nose right there also around my mouth
area it's looking a little bit heavy
that looks nice
okay let's try this with a sponge on the
other side
this sponge lately has been like
mattifying my foundations oddly enough
some foundations I feel like the sponge
works really well and some it just makes
look too matte and I feel like it soaks
up definitely went a lot farther with
the brush I'm gonna come back to my nose
because I kind of have to use a little
brush to go around the nose right
ooh on the forehead though that looks
really nice with the sponge whoa
this kind of reminds me of the hooda
Beauty foundation the way it's looking
on the skin that one I think has a
little bit more coverage that is like
opaque coverage just the consistency of
this and the way it goes on kind of
reminds me of that using my small
concealer brush to go around my nose
over here like how it looks with the
brush here down but on my forehead I
like how that's with the sponge that
looks pretty dang good not loving how it
looks around my nose on both sides I'm
hoping it doesn't settle I'm hoping it
kind of just warms up to my skin because
around here it does look like it's
started you starting to crease a little
bit and around my nose area just is
clinging a little bit but it looks nice
I wouldn't say this is opaque opaque
full-coverage I would say it's kind of a
low full coverage you can still see my
freckles coming through and stuff I kind
of like that because it's giving me the
coverage that I like without making my
skin look mask like which is what they
said I feel like that's true let's test
out this zoom by the way I don't put
filters on my videos I never will
I think that's absurd I want you guys to
see what my skin looks like hence why we
are very up close you see things
softened it's because a lens softens the
corners and everything so that's why I
like this looks blurry lights are way
down low so hopefully we can really see
everything so here's where it's starting
to settle a little bit like there like I
was talking about it doesn't look bad I
just noticed that love how my forehead
looks overall I think it looks really
nice I think if I was using this again I
would probably use both sponge and brush
I think I would apply it with a brush
and then smooth it out with a sponge as
you can see you can still see some of my
skin coming through which I really like
so right now it's 11:02 so we're gonna
call the check-in time 11 o'clock
coffee break got my BAE Rito mug by the
way I love seeing all of your pictures
in Beirut oh sure it's in sweatshirts
and the mug
and everything linked for this is down
below if you want to join the club
Cheers
so right now I'm feeling this one I feel
like it's not too dewy has a really
pretty
glowy natural but still gives you
coverage kind of look so I just do the
rest of my makeup it's now 11 26 what
I've been doing every single time I do
my makeup probably for the last couple
months is using the Laura Geller balance
in Brighton powder and I just set my
face from here down not my chin area
literally just my cheek area right here
and not around my nose or anything just
where I'm gonna be blending powder
products like blush bronzer highlight I
don't set my forehead or anything if I
do that my skin looks way too dry with
any powder and I just don't find that I
need to so that's what I did and
everything blended out beautifully on
top I love how my skin looks right now
pretty much nothing different than the
last time I'm going to serve a clip
right here in natural lighting just you
guys can see how it looks so here's what
my foundation looks like in natural
lighting looking really nice I'm gonna
zoom in I have a feeling this is gonna
be a creaser but we shall see right now
my forehead I think I'm gonna start
doing flashback in my foundation videos
just so we can see if there's any bounce
back for those of you who care and look
for a foundation that doesn't have flash
back so here we go here's a little flash
test okay and it does mal that looks
like a mug shot okay so it looks very
soft like it looks really flattering on
the skin in flash but there does seem to
be definitely a bounce back my face
looks quite a bit lighter than my neck
in the photo so far so good I'm loving
the way that this looks right now so on
the rest of my face I have a couple
products I want to give you like follow
ups on that I mentioned in other videos
and tell you my updated thoughts and
then just things that I keep using so
for contour using a trace Prime and fine
I love this thing blush that I am
quickly falling in love with is the jus
I adore blush duo I use this shade right
here today these blend out so
effortlessly they're beautiful the
formula and everything is stunning we
should have you so far somehow it works
because you can really build these up
highlight which I feel like I'm not
going to be able to put down I use this
yesterday and I also use this today this
is the XO Beauty highlight in Aurora and
it looks like it's just a pressed like
face powder almost in the pan but this
gives you the most beautiful if you like
that super subtle glow it really is like
a glow from within kind of look very
subtle but
stunning holy cease I'm feeling
this so after the Sephora products that
never make it out of my cart video a
bunch of you guys said I have to try out
the visi art eyeshadow palette I just
need to cave so I ended up getting the
petite Pro palette cuz I didn't want to
spend like $5,000 on a busy art full-on
eyeshadow palette without trying it
first if you have both let me know if
this formula and the mini palette is
different than their other shadows
because these are not that great
these ones are nothing special in my
opinion especially for the price I'm
like very underwhelmed today I just have
these two matte shades on my eyes do I
need to get the big Vizio eye palette
it's that one way better let me know and
then for a lipstick I use the flower
Beauty liquid lipstick in the shade goes
would and then I topped it off just a
tiny bit on the center with the same
liquid lipstick formula and almost nude
this is a very light pink so sounds
really nice for mixing and with other
liquid lipsticks I'm gonna keep this on
for my usual 10 hour wear test the next
check and I do will be in natural
lighting I think I'm actually gonna be
working out today I know
shocker my goal is to walk a minimum of
two miles at least five times a week in
so far so far I'm going strong we might
see how this foundation also does
throughout a little bit of shrit Singh
okay it is now 336 so it's been on for
four and a half hours so let's take a
look haven't looked at my face all
afternoon all right so it's creasing a
bit like I predicted around my nose
especially and then I'm actually getting
a pretty big crease line on my forehead
I haven't been like making any
expressions or anything I don't think
I've just been working on the computer
by the way I haven't touched up my
lipstick if you're also curious about
that you can see it kind of settling
into my fine lines right there I don't
love how it looks around my nose it just
looks a little bit heavy nose and upper
lip and then also again around this area
I think overall it still looks really
pretty and radiant or something about
this that's just very it is it's just
radiant looking without being too dewy
but we'll see how it wears throughout
the rest of the night so I'm about to go
work out right now so we're gonna put
this thing to the test I'm going to be
changing out and be wiping off the
lipstick so I'll see you guys at the end
of the night okay so it's now the end of
the night it
nine o'clock I just ate like 5,000 jelly
beans so I did work out there was a
point the peak where I was really going
up on that incline so I did get a good
sweat going on my forehead and I took a
clip so I'm gonna start it right here of
what my face looks like right after I
worked out I was about ten minutes after
held up really really well I definitely
remember at one point during the workout
there was sweat phul and like dripping
down my face and I was thinking it was
gonna be a total disaster and it held up
amazing like you can't even tell I
worked out so as far as how it looks
right now it's not been on for ten hours
and I think it looks good I still think
it could look better around my nose area
and the crease actually seems to look
better throughout the day on my forehead
doesn't actually seem quite as
noticeable now I do feel like my blush
bronzer and highlight didn't hold up
very well it seems like all those that
kind of faded off there at the day and
sometimes that can be a sign of the
foundation underneath because it's
what's kind of folded and on my eyes are
red right now I do not smoke I get so
many comments about that I just get
bloodshot it's worn off a bit right on
center of my forehead right here does
look like it's faded a bit in certain
areas but overall considering it's been
on for ten hours and I worked out I
think it looks pretty good this one I
like I like the coverage I like how
radiant and just kind of healthy it
looks I think this one for me with just
a dab of CYO mixed in the lifeproof
foundation I think that might be perfect
because I think that would kind of help
smooth out some of the line issues and
like clinging around the nose so hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you did
