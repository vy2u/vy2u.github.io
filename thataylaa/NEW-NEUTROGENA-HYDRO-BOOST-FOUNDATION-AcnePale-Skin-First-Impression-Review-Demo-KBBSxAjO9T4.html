Friday and it is snowing right now in
Seattle randomly I'm even oh hi I'm
sitting inside right now I'm so excited
so today I'm trying out a new foundation
from the drugstore this is the
Neutrogena hydro boost hydrating tint
foundation I also have the new hydro
boost hydrating concealer here using
both of these guys in today's video I
actually got the concealer for free
because of extra bucks
gotta love CVS if you split up your
transactions you can use extra bucks
from your first purchase on your second
purchase so I basically got this thing
for free so Before we jump into talking
about the foundation I just have a
couple things I want to share with you
guys the first what was the first so
lighting I just want to say thank you to
everyone who left feedback and just
really thoughtful comments honestly on
the last foundation Friday video I'm
glad you guys are liking this lighting I
also really like this I feel like you
can actually see my skin and it's not
too dark a light or whatever so thank
you for all the comments on that video
the second thing which I'm super excited
to share with you guys my babies 15:48
my liquid lipstick that I made with B
hue T is coming back in stock this is
going to be the last restock it's not
going to be permanent since this is the
only restock we're doing there's a
limited quantity available so if you do
want to purchase 1548 and you didn't get
around to the first time now is the
chance to get your guy to get your guy
now is the chance to get your hands on
this guy if you're new or you miss the
launch of 1548 I'm going to leave the
announcement video in the little eye
over here and down below in the
description box that basically talks
about what went into actually making
this lipstick and just the meaning
behind it and its importance and all
that so thank you to everyone who
purchased this and supported me the
first time around I loved seeing you
guys wearing 1548 on Twitter and
snapchat and everywhere so very excited
that this will be back in stock I'm pre
filming this video a few days so I don't
know the exact day of relaunch right now
so I'm going to put it on the screen
right here because I should know by
Friday so right here this is one 1548
will be relaunching so let's jump into
the video if you're new here I do
foundation Friday every single Friday on
my channel it's a new first impression
video I'll leave the playlist down below
in the description box if you haven't
seen any of them yet
this foundation retails for $14.99 on
there is one fluid ounce of product in
here which is very standard for liquid
foundation I've the trade natural ivory
20 which is actually not the lightest
shade the lightest shade is 10 when I
was looking at these in CBS the shade 10
looks pretty yellow which is why I went
for this shade but you guys will see my
thoughts on the shade as we're doing the
demo and everything the foundation comes
in 10 shades I do want to go pick up the
shade tents right now I only have the
shade 20 but I'm going to search
swatches here's watch time right here's
the Neutrogena foundation in the shade
20 I'm going to swatch this again for
you right now right here because
literally within about a minute this has
completely oxidized this is bizarre
watch this so here's the shade when you
just apply it look at that difference
that is insane it literally darkens a
couple shades within a minute you guys
will see it develop as we talk about the
other swatches so next over is my
current favorite to your cosmetics Berra
doll foundation in the lightest shade
porcelain here's derma Col to 0-8 and
then here is the Tarte reinforces at the
foundation in the new lightest shade
porcelain and then last is the Urban
Decay Naked foundation in 0.5 and my
battery is literally about to die so as
you can see this is already majorly
oxidizes first shade over so the
packaging of this foundation reminds me
exactly of the Clinique foundation you
have this huge applicator it looks like
a giant concealer wand kind of like the
Tarte shaped a blonde I kind of like the
applicator on the Clinique one so it
doesn't really bother me so let's jump
into some of the claims here it says
Neutrogena hydration infused weightless
water gel hydro boost hydrating tint
plumps and boost hydration while
providing natural looking coverage
moisturizes and plump skin for 24 hours
doesn't settle and define lines
boost hydration for 24 hours for more
radiant smoother skin overtime better
for your skin than wearing no makeup at
all make your skin better even after you
take it off so this is supposed to be
kind of like a skin care product and
foundation in one oil free non
comedogenic non greasy Beauvoir so it's
pretty much all the claims this does
have hyaluronic acid in it which is
really good for anti-aging it doesn't
say that the foundation is supposed to
last on your skin for 24 hours it just
says it moisturizes and plumps the skin
for 24 hours so we'll see how long this
works throughout the day I typically do
10 hour check-ins I have combination
skin with cystic acne I get pretty oily
throughout the day on my t-zone I feel
like I need to switch that line up a
little bit okay
that exact same thing in every video
I've heard extremely positive and also
extremely negative reviews on this
product so we'll see what I think of it
so that's all the claims if you want to
see how the Neutrogena hydraboost
hydrating tint foundation applies and
wear throughout the day you're in the
right place just keep watching just
started filming with my mic not even
plugged in so attempt number two it is
8:14 in the morning right now I've
already washed moisturized and primed to
my face use my Joey anti blemish matte
primer like usual so because this one is
supposed to be lighter coverage I am
going to try and spot conceal with the
hydro boost concealer that I have here
because I obviously have some acne spots
and stuff to cover up right now
exciting news watch my foundation
brushes so I'm going to be going in with
the Sigma f80 on one side of my face and
then this NYX flawless flawless finish
sponge-on the other side the shade is
actually looking a little bit different
than it did in CB s now so I'm hoping
this is going to match so what I do with
my Clinique Foundation which is like
this is I just put it on the skin maybe
not the most sanitary if you really want
to you can put it on a pallet and then
dip it right into the pallet but sue me
it feels really smooth going on like the
applicator feels really smooth going in
with the brush it feels almost like
you're putting a moisturizer on yes
definitely very light coverage it evened
out some of my redness it didn't cover
any of the acne I wasn't really
expecting it to but did even out my skin
tone I am going to see if this is
buildable but let's go in on the
forehead first it feels like a super
lightweight moisturizer let's see how it
goes on with a sponge I think we've got
even lighter coverage with the sponge
this side is looking like shear in this
side is looking like light coverage I
would say personally I like how to apply
better with the brush let's go in for a
second layer over here I'm gonna use the
brush to do the second layer on both
sides just to see if this is buildable I
think I actually should have gone with
ten just because this is looking target
on camera but is looking a bit more pink
than my neck it has more coverage than
on the first layer now but it's still at
light coverage for sure I do like the
way it goes on it feels a little bit
cooling not emphasizing any texture or
anything anywhere my skin just looks
kind of nice and smooth and plump very
light coverage freckles I mean
everything's coming through basically
just evened out my skin tone I'm going
to blend this down my neck a little bit
just because it is too pink tone I think
if you have a similar skin tone to mine
I would go with it ten shades all right
so we're going to go with this concealer
and hope that we can spot conceal a bit
down here it looks pretty dark in here
for my skin tone so hoping we can match
this if it has unique hydrating core
design to instantly clench the skin
which is this little white corn here non
greasy lightweight formula glides onto
the skin providing natural looking
coverage and this is in the shade fair
ten the lightest shades so SWAT team is
on my hand and I guys can see that it
looks pretty dark definitely darker than
my face let's try and to blend in my
concealer under my eyes and to spot
concealer I always use the morphe g 38
brush blend is in cyan I think looks
like a medium coverage concealer to me
it's helping to tone down some of the
redness but you definitely still see
those spots coming through I'm going to
put some on my acne scarring over here
it feels very lightweight blending out
alright so I actually don't mind the way
my skin looks right now I feel like my
acne is covered enough but it doesn't
look like a ton of coverage it still
looks like skin and really natural there
you go as you can so you can still see
some of my skin coming through if you
like my forehead looks really nice and
moisturized and it really isn't clinging
anywhere I would say right now it's
looking like a satin finish a little bit
dewy so to conceal my under eyes like
normal I'm gonna use my Tarte shape tape
concealer but I'm not going to put that
anywhere else in my face I don't think
I'm going to set my face with the powder
because sometimes with light coverage
foundations I feel like when I do that
it makes it look worse because I'm just
looks kind of
dry without coverage so we're calling
check-in time 8:30 I'm going to do the
rest of my makeup and I'll be right back
all right so it's now 9 o'clock the rest
of my makeup is clearly on I have to say
I do really like the way my skin looks
right now looks really healthy super
glowy if you like more matte you'll
either have to set this with a matte
powder or this one isn't for you because
this one is very glowy especially as
it's kind of warmed up to my skin now I
would say it's definitely dewy but I
don't mind as long as I'm not a
greaseball by the end of the day like I
said I didn't powder this one and blush
bronzer highlight and everything blended
out totally fine on top I use the cream
highlight which was kind of mistake but
maybe it kind of works who knows I do
think it already has oxidized and you
guys can't see as much in here but if
you can see here's my chest color and my
face is definitely a couple shades too
dark it's not showing up as much on
camera it looks like but when I was just
in the bathroom we're putting on my
lipstick it definitely looks darker to
me it looks like it's already oxidized
since I put it on so if I wore this
again I would definitely need to go pick
up the shade 10 the lightest shade so on
the rest of my face for eyes I used the
new pixie it's GG's time palette this is
Judy's brand new eyeshadow palette and
I've only used matte shades in here but
holy C's they blend it out
beautifully super buttery pigmented I've
never tried any other pixie eyeshadows
I'm not sure if they're all like this I
just went in with a few of the matte
shades and they're super pretty so I was
watching one of my friend Holly's videos
Holly adds lipstick if you haven't heard
of her channel a link it down below but
she also has pale skin she has more dry
skin she is really beautiful skin I'm so
jealous
but in one of her videos actually I
think it was the review on this now I'm
thinking about it I think it was her
cheeks just looked beautiful so I
messaged her asking what she was wearing
and it was the Physicians Formula butter
bronzer topped off with a two-faced
peach blush so that's what I have on my
cheeks right now I didn't really contour
anything I just kind of put that more on
the apples of my cheeks and it looks
really nice and warm but not to oranjee
I don't like the butter bronzer as a
bronzer for me like if I put it over
here it just looks too orange and then
my highlight like I said is a cream
highlight typically I don't put creams
on top of any kind of powder because on
my skin it just looks totally weird and
since I did have my under eye I
Terron it started getting a little weird
texture but I just blended out with my
finger and it looks beautiful this is
the Wet n Wild mega cushion highlight
this is their new one and then on my
lips which are probably already talked
about in the intro is my lipstick with
BG oh this is 1548 and way too excited
to go in the snow right now so I'm going
to check back in with you guys next
check and I do will be in natural
lighting so I'll see you guys in a few
all right so it's now 1:30 so
foundations a time for 5 hours I am
liking how it looks I just feel like I'm
already starting to look pretty Gracie
on my forehead and it has definitely
oxidized here's my chest I feel like it
looks a couple shades dark right now but
looking in the mirror and everything it
just looks really nice and smooth it
almost looks like just a tinted
moisturizer I do like the coverage I
don't mind the coverage with the
concealer on top and the rest of my
makeup on I feel like I'm going to get
pretty oily by the end of the night if
I'm already this oily but up close it's
not creasing or anything around my nose
or on my upper lip so I will check back
in with you guys at the end of the night
okay so it's now six seventeen so
foundations been on for almost 10 hours
I Cameron from doing the check-in time
8:30 a.m. or 9 I think it was 8:30 I've
been doing taxes for the last five hours
adulting fun stuff so let's talk about
this foundation so I feel like it's not
even showing up quite as much in the
viewfinder at least but it has majorly
oxidized and I kind of yeah you can't
even tell my face looks pretty orange
right now like I definitely look and you
can tell because my concealer is way
lighter than normal but I am oily very
oily I noticed that at the 5 hour point
like I said and it kind of just went
downhill from there it does say it's a
hydrating moisturizing foundation so if
you don't have all your skin like I do
if you have more dry skin you might like
this the good thing is that even though
it's super oily it's not really breaking
down anywhere like you can't see the
separation on my skin it just looks very
oily yeah look at my forehead right now
it is like a freakin grease ball and
even though it's really oily around my
nose and on my nose and everywhere
pretty much like I said it's not taking
up any where it's not really creasing it
doesn't look like it's really breaking
down
like I've said in past videos I'm not
someone who blocked my face I don't like
to touch up my makeup throughout the day
I just want a foundation that's going to
stay on all day so kind of concluding
thoughts I think if you have dry skin
you might like this because it is very
very moisturizing oily skin probably
wouldn't recommend keep in mind it does
oxidize quite a bit I would say two
shades maybe even three so if you guys
liked this video make sure you give it a
thumbs up so I know I cannot wait to
wash off my face right now and put on a
face mask I can always let me know down
below what foundations you guys want to
see for next week's foundation Friday I
also do pulls on Twitter to see which
ones you want and also on snapchat make
sure you're following me on all my
social media handles I will put them
right here
love you guys thanks for watching see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
