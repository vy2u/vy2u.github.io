Friday I'm wearing pink today it's not
black so today we're going to be talking
all about the new NYX total control
drops foundation I keep on and say total
cover L'Oreal have a review on that one
so it has been a struggle and a half's
trying to get my hands on this
foundation I actually ordered the shade
zero one pale when it first came out
online the day it went up actually and
it took 14 days to get here from the
next website 14 days now when I actually
got this and swatched it to see the
shade this is very very pale you'll see
in swatches how light this is this
foundation comes in 24 shades which i
think is amazing and it looks like it
goes pretty deep and it definitely goes
very very light
so basically when I got this in the mail
I went on an entire hunt throughout
Seattle I think I went to eight stores
total to try and find the right shade
and I'm actually getting 0-6 vanilla I
figured I might as well go dark and then
we can mix the two shades I did end up
picking up the brush that you're
supposed to apply this foundation with
both of these retail for $14 in the
foundation you get 0.43 fluid ounces of
product so not a full ounce but four
drops of this is supposed to be full
coverage will see two drops of light
coverage three dresses medium coverage
and four for full coverage is the
frosted glass bottle so nice packaging
$14 for a drugstore foundation is on the
higher end flipping on the next website
let's read some of the claims because
it's a velvety matte foundation simply
adjust the number of drops until you
create the look you're feeling today
want more coverage add more drops it
tells us you have a very basic shade
finder online you basically just click
the face that you think you look like so
I'm going to search swatches right now
of this foundation compared to some of
the other foundations that I own I must
watch both shades just you can see them
all right so swatch time if this will
focus here's the next drop foundation in
zero one here's our Emma shade zero six
this is the Tarte reinforce of the C
foundation and the new lightest shade
porcelain fourth over is der McCall 2:08
which is actually an almost exact match
to me and say der McCall 2:08 and the
agent has BB bay cover foundation and
white shade are my closest matches with
the Josie Maran Argan foundation and are
five has a new wet-and-wild photophobia
foundation and the lightest shade like
always will leave the foundation Friday
play list down below but I do new first
impression videos every single day just
going to say every single day every
single Friday on my channel 6 p.m.
Pacific time I upload Monday Wednesday
Fridays everything I use today and
everything that's on my face is in the
description box if you want to see my
thoughts on the next total control
foundation you're in the right place
just keep watching so I lost all of my
hair clips where do they disappear hair
clips are like socks where do they
actually go I'm convinced that somewhere
on earth there's a giant stack of bobby
pins socks and hair clips so my skin
right now is freaking out first off
burned my face with a curling iron so
that's what that is
I've some major breakouts down here
right now pretty much all over my skin
has not been good the past couple weeks
I've already watched moisturize and
prime my face use my AGA anti blemish
matte primer like normal and I actually
did pick up their foundation brush as
well so I can get this thing undone
literally going in with the big boys
this is just a curved angled brush it
has a little bit of a dip to it I kind
of thought it was going to have a hole
in the middle like the unique brush does
and the bare minerals brush but this one
doesn't I should probably wash this
before I put it on my face but
technicalities I also have my elf brush
on one side I'll link the exact went
down below and then this pur cosmetics
sponge so if you're new here I have
combination skin with cystic acne I get
pretty oily throughout the day on my
t-zone so I think I'm going to end up
mixing these two shades because this one
looks a bit dark and zero one is
extremely light let's shake these up
super liquidy whoa so all the videos the
next has been posting on Instagram show
people dropping it directly into the
brush we'll try that that rarely almost
never works out for me I usually have to
kind of stipple it onto a palette and
then apply it to my face or dot it onto
my face and then blend out if I haven't
watched this 0/6 shade yet on my face
I'm actually just going to a little bit
to see if I need to mix it oh I don't
know I've never been above a zero to
shade in my life this is crazy let's
just try to zero six eighty first and I
might mix in a couple drops of the other
one just as simply address the number of
drops until desired level of coverage is
achieved more drops equals more coverage
I'm going to
drop it first in this brush and I'm
going to do four one two three four like
they say that is full coverage and I'm
assuming nothing yeah I mean I don't
think anything actually came out on my
face okay we're not doing that I'm going
to drop it straight on to my face
one two attempting not to hit my face
with the thing for ish okay now let's
kind of blend this out definitely should
not put this in your brush when they say
four drops I'm assuming they meant four
drops for your entire face should be
full coverage four drops on the quarter
of my face basically we're looking like
medium coverage in here the shade is
looking like a pretty good match
actually so it's hard to tell miss
lightening until I step outside but I
think the shade is pretty good I'm going
to put three drops on a palette and just
stipple the same brush in and apply it
to the top of my forehead this brush is
soft what I just get it with up try to
look for some smell let's see how much
this covers on this side with the elf
brush I actually think I like just
dropping this directly onto my face so
one two three four we'll see if this
covers any of my acne and the scar right
here I think I prefer this brush to the
next one it's just less flimsy and just
easier to blend out faster you'll see
the scar you can still see freckles you
can still see lots of acne coming
through down here whoa whoa almost had a
foundation eyebrow that didn't do a
whole lot it says use as many drops as
you want for more coverage so I'm going
in again because to me with that amount
it looks like barely medium coverage
like very light medium coverage I'm
going to try the sponge on this side of
my face for a second layer and then
we'll use the brush again on the other
side and I'm just going to do five wow
this is so liquidy
okay this I would say is medium coverage
I think now we are at solid medium
coverage with five more drops that's
right now I have about nine drops just
on this portion of my face if you are
using this to get good coverage I feel
like you would go through this bottle
pretty quickly I don't know if I love
how this is sitting on my face so we'll
talk about that in a second so for a
second layer on this side I'm going to
go back in with this elf brush I'm going
to do five drops again feels very
lightweight kind of like the Maybelline
Dream wonder this side I don't feel like
my scarring and freckles are totally
covered so I'm just going to go in with
a little bit more since so chic and oh
 that just went right on my shirt
now we're talking now with three more
drops on this side I got the kind of
coverage I normally like this side
actually looks a little bit patchy I
just noticed so I think to actually get
full coverage you would have to use way
more product than they say there's no
way in hell four drops of give you full
coverage unless you have flawless skin
to begin with I'm going to add one more
drop just to see if I can cover the acne
a little more just want to split so if
you build this up it will cover you're
just going to have to majorly majorly
build this up if you actually want
coverage right now it doesn't look
amazing it looks like it's a little bit
textured in some areas like around my
nose and in the center of my forehead
but my cheeks look pretty good
my forehead feels like it's pretty much
set it is transferring a little bit
right now it's 926
I think I am going to powder my face
with this one just because I don't know
I think it might slide around a little
bit so I am going to powder I hope
that's not the wrong decision okay so
it's now 941 I actually finished my face
makeup at 9:30 so we're calling check-in
time 9:30 so I did set this with the
powder I ended up using the celebration
foundation illumination by a cosmetics
and I'm very glad I did because I like
it 50 times better now I think once I
put this powder on it kind of took away
the weird I wanna say chalky but there's
almost like this dry texture to it
and now that I have this powder on it
everything just looks a lot more smooth
even doesn't look like there's a ton of
product sitting on top of it even though
there is still a little texture on my
nose and the center of my forehead for
bronzer / I did a really natural kind of
bronze contour today I use the essence
light up your face palette at the shade
right here and you really have to build
this up blush is all made nude mob 20 I
love this blush up and reaching for this
a lot
then my highlight is essence eyeshadow
in zero 8 up ricotta as I used two of
the new color pop shadows I'm debating
doing a full video on these just because
spoiler alert I'm pretty impressed my
crease I use this shade wake up call and
then on my lid I used liar liar' then
lips is a new Urban Decay vice liquid
lipstick in the shade Vampira mixed
feelings on they go on very thin and
pretty sheer for a liquid lipstick
they're not super opaque so you kind of
have to go over it a couple times but
when you do it dries down we'll see how
this works throughout the day to the 930
is the check-in time the next reckon I
do will be in natural lighting so you
guys can see how it looks in real light
I'm going to get up close so you can see
everything right now keep in mind there
a giant studio lights blurring
everything out so I will be back in a
few hours okay so it's now 2 o'clock so
it's been on for four and a half hours
so I don't know if it's oxidize a little
bit or if I just can actually see the
shades but as you can see here's my neck
and then you can see where the
foundation kind of stopped out here so I
think that shake it actually is a bit
dark
you just need my face like that so it
looks fine but it definitely is darker
than my chest coming eh is looking
pretty average you don't love the way
it's sitting on my skin I also don't
hate it
it's looking a little bit crusty on my
nose nothing horrible I'm not going to
get any major creasing on my upper lip
yet at least my forehead looks good
I've been majorly adulting for the last
4 hours dealing with health care and
taxes Sunday I'm going to keep this on
until the end of the night and I will
check back with you guys then so it's
now 817 so it's been on for almost 11
hours I literally just walked in the
door hence my jacket and scarf
I've no got my nails done I was running
errands and when I was in one of the
stores around 4:30 I looked in the
mirror and I looked pretty oily like I
was starting to get oily at that point
already from that point actually hasn't
gotten too much worse oil actually isn't
horrible for me I can get a lot earlier
than this I do have crease lines on my
or live and around my nose is looking a
lot more flattering in this lighting
when I was actually out and looking in
the car mirror and stuff it didn't look
super great do I think this one is worth
it no coverage aside even if you like
light coverage I think there are way
better light coverage foundations out
there $14 isn't a super cheap foundation
I just think that there are better
lighter coverage foundations on the
market drugstore and high-end something
about this one that I don't quite like
it almost reminds me of the hard candy
drops and the unique foundation
definitely not nearly as bad as unique
foundations not that oily not that
greasy at all but there's something
about this just the texture of it I
don't know I don't like it coverage I
did obviously build it up pretty well I
just don't think I would spend that much
time putting 50 drops of foundation on
my face every day four drops to get full
coverage is just not reality honestly I
don't know how to drops could even cover
your entire face even if you have good
skin so if you like even medium coverage
I don't really think this one is worth
it just because the amount of product
you have to use if you have pretty good
skin and you're just looking for
something to even out your skin tone
maybe I just don't think it's worth the
money that is just my opinion
I could always say do your own research
with your money if you want to buy a
product go for it test it try it
everyone has different opinions
something that I love you might hate
something that I hate you might love wow
I feel like I just totally shot on that
yeah just don't know if I'd spend $14 on
this actually I know I wouldn't I would
not oh I also changed my lip color it is
a two-faced cool girl liquid lipstick
the Urban Decay one started wearing off
a little bit and I just wasn't feeling
the pink for like going out and running
errands so I just put this on if you
guys like foundation Friday videos make
sure to give this a thumbs up if you're
