cookie interesting all right so today we
have a review on this guy this is the
brand-new Physicians Formula mineral
we're EBC all-in-one cushion foundation
cushion technology there are so many
claims on this box I can even read them
all
this was the freaking hardest foundation
to get my hands on I finally found it at
Fred Meyer in Seattle but they were out
of the lightshade story of my life so I
ended up ordering this on Ulta and it
was around 1699 which is pricey for a
drugstore foundation especially because
you only get 0.47 fluid ounces of
product a typical foundation has one
ounce of product so if they give you an
ounce of this product or basin costs $32
which is a high-end foundation that's
something to consider it only comes in
three shades light light medium and dark
so they called them I think so according
to physician is formulas website they
only have light light medium and medium
so I guess they don't even have dark
shade you'll see when I apply it but I
clearly have very pale skin here's my
actual skin tone down here if you have
pale skin this one's definitely not
going to work for you way too dark so
I'm going to go through some of the
claims of foundation held that good
stuff and then I'll show you guys me
applying it and checking in throughout
the night because it is night right now
so this has SPF 50 which is nice if
you're going to be outside you do have
to reapply it every two hours it says it
is a high-tech cushion a unique cushion
sponge delivery system the light to
medium coverage which I agree with
you'll see in the demo what the hell is
an ABC formula I swear Physicians
Formula has the most ridiculous claims
on their packaging sometimes they
literally just make this up moisturizing
and brightening benefits that leave skin
with a luminous finish okay I definitely
have to disagree with the luminous
finish claim I highlighted my under eyes
and set that but other than that I'm not
wearing a powder I do love the packaging
how could you not love this I feel like
this is super unique packaging that's
hard I thought this is going to be like
a soft cushion but I guess that is
better for cleaning so it doesn't get
all dirty and disgusting looking on the
outside I do have to say I'm typically a
huge fan of Physicians Formula two of
their products are like my Holy Grail
products my under-eye powder
my booster eyeliner and I've never had a
Physicians Formula product break me out
which is really nice just to give you a
quick background on my skin I have
pretty normal to combo skin acne prone
super sensitive skin finding foundations
that don't break me out is a huge
challenge if you guys want to hear my
thoughts on this foundation and see how
it wears throughout the day you're in
the right place just keep watching it is
after work right now what time is it
it's 5:40 2 p.m. and I just had an urge
to film and I really wanted to try out
this foundation having used this at all
yet but I did open it up last night just
to see the color I do not think this is
going to be pale princess friendly look
at how dark that looks hence why I'm
doing this at 5 p.m. at night I don't
think I'm going to be able to wear this
outside the house about looking like an
oompa loompa we're going to give it a go
here probably what my Beauty Blender
okay so we're just going to go into
application I have a whole review on the
L'Oreal cushion foundation so if you
want to hear kind of the background on
cushion foundations and what I think of
that one I will leave that video down
below in the description box so it comes
with this little cushion pad right here
so I'm going to apply half my face with
this and then the other half with a
makeup sponge this is by pur cosmetics
and I do have some major acne on my chin
right now and a little bit on the side
of my face
so we'll see how much this covers up
also I curled my hair today for the
first time since it's been cut short
what do you guys think I think I liked
it better curly actually so I'm just
going to try to blend this down my neck
as much as possible I feel like I'm
forgetting something
oh I primed my face I used a tiny bit of
the jouer anti blemish matte primer so
let's just go ahead and press in so I
feel like it comes off definitely a
little bit more patchy than the L'Oreal
one so I'm going to go in and press a
little bit harder this is gonna be so
dark so I'm going to do like rolling
motions right off the bat super matte
finish
we'll see how much it covers up these
spots down here this smells really
bizarre it smells like some kind of
gluten-free cookie interesting it
definitely feels it feels very like
stiff almost it feels like once you put
it on your face it's kind of like stuck
there there's not a whole lot of
blending out that happens and yeah it
dries almost instantly
it isn't transferring that much which is
nice drag this down a little definitely
if you have pale skin this ain't gonna
work for you this is hella dark like I
said in the intro they came out of three
shades of this which I just think is
absurd how many people is that gonna
work for okay so let's do the forehead
so far I say it's a light medium
coverage and more on the light side I am
using quite a bit of product this is
such a weird scent okay so there's one
layer on that side of the face here's
before and after so yeah I would say
it's a light medium you can definitely
still see acne peeking through it kind
of just evened out my skin tone it made
me like ten shades Tanner so I'm going
to go in with the sponge for the other
side so I usually like to use the flat
edge of this so I'm just going to pounce
and again it's kind of patchy on the
sponge okay already a lot better
coverage with the sponge yeah okay way
better coverage with the sponge oh man
I'm usually not super picky about sense
but this is bringing me back to like the
gluten free days let's pour cut it up
the finish looks pretty similar I would
say it's like a satin matte finish your
parts my face I'd definitely look more
matte I'm gonna coat the back in this
 here's one layer basically this I
definitely got better coverage I'm going
to go over with the second layer using
this sponge you see how much we can get
on this side
so obviously is buildable still the most
coverage we're gonna get is about a
medium coverage so this is what my skin
looks like with two layers of foundation
on I am happy that the tone is more of a
neutral tone than it looks in the pan
it looks pretty orange to me in there
but once it's actually on the face it's
not horrible it definitely is way too
dark but it's not absolutely like
horrendous when you're closing this you
do want to make sure that you fully
press and hear it snap when you seal it
the air doesn't get into the cushion and
dry it out so I'm going to apply the
rest of my makeup and we'll be right
back okay so I just applied the rest of
my makeup clearly I use the new NYX
embellishment whether it's called NYX
lingerie I only wore this one other time
so far I'm really liking these I think
I'm going to do a full review on these
so let me know if you want to see that I
feel like I'm kind of pleasantly
surprised with what it looks like with
the rest of my makeup on it is looking a
lot better like shade wise on camera
than it does in real life but as far as
the finish and stuff it definitely is
more of a satin matte finish there's a
hair my pores are like out to party
right now I feel like I don't normally
have that noticeably huge pores but they
look for getting large right now like
even right here where I didn't even know
I had pores
my forehead looks very textured you can
see the foundation getting in my
wrinkles it may be a smoothing primer
underneath would help that situation you
can still see my acne down here it's red
again I feel like it's kind of settling
in lines around my lips that I didn't
really know I had blush or bronzer
everything blended out super easily on
top of it it does dry very fast which is
nice if you're in a rush so this isn't
going to be a super one first impression
since it's already 6:10 p.m. so far not
feeling the texture but as far as
everything else and like overall
coverage and just how it looks from not
super close-up I feel like it looks
decent
so it's 6/10 like I just said 30 seconds
ago we want to try and keep this on as
long as possible actually woke up at
5:30 tomorrow for work so I'm not sure
how late I'm going to be staying up
tonight gonna do my best ok so it is now
955 p.m. so it's been on for almost 4
hours it definitely looks
dewier than it did
earlier I'm starting to get oily around
my nose and on my forehead up here it
definitely looks like I'm wearing makeup
I'm just going to show you guys up close
so you can see what I'm talking about
the light is probably making a look a
little bit more flattering but it is
starting to break up around my nose
right here and then I don't know I just
feel like my forehead looks extra
textured just the way that this sits on
my skin I probably wouldn't recommend it
too if you have dry skin not sure how it
works with oily skin but the fact that
I'm already getting oily isn't a good
sign first impressions I think it's a
decent medium coverage foundation I'm
not like super into it but I also don't
think it's horrible let me know what you
guys think of this if you've tried it
let me know in the comments down below I
don't think it's enough coverage for me
to want to wear on a daily basis I think
if my acne goes down maybe but I would
definitely have to mix in so Manic Panic
or a foundation liner in with it I know
at the L'Oreal one you can pop out the
sponge and actually technically you
could mix in a foundation Lightner so
I'm not sure if you can do that with
this one but I might play around with it
I think if you're curious and you want
to spend $60 on drugstore foundation you
could try it and what I've experienced
so far I don't really think it's worth
the 16 dollars I probably wouldn't
recommend that you purchase it just my
thoughts so if you guys like this video
