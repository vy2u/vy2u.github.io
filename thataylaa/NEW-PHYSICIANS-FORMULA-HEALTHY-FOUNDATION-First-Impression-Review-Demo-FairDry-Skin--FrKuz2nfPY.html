Friday this is why I try out a new
foundation every single Friday on my
channel 6 p.m. Pacific time we have a
new foundation by Physicians Formula
this is the healthy foundation so it's
called so this town dation has 1 fluid
ounce of product which is standard in
retails for 1495 on position formulas
websites read some of the claims on
position why am I having such a hard
time saying physician it's physicians
formula physicians have everything
physicians physician formulas so reading
some of the claims on their website it
says it's a long wearing Belgian bole
breathable foundation that provides
lightweight medium to full coverage with
the healthy satin finish compatible with
all skin types it has brightening
complex and hyaluronic acid
hypoallergenic fragrance free paraben
free block and cruelty free and vegan
comes in 16 shades which is a major step
up for physicians formula their
foundations usually only come in like
the read shades you can maybe even less
than that sometimes I've - - lighter
shades lc1 and LW - so LC one is
obviously cool LW - is warm they don't
have an LW one shade I'm guessing if
they're starting at LW - hopefully
they'll come out with it and I'll W one
shade maybe but I'm wearing the shade LC
one I'm gonna start swatches right here
of the two lightest shades compared to
some of the other friend Asians I own
all right so swatch time the first two
is the Physicians Formula foundation in
LC 1 and then LW - next / CYO life proof
in the lightest shade derma called 2:08
Laura Geller cover lock in porcelain and
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless in
110 I talk more about packaging and
everything in the demo so let's get into
it if you're new here you can join the
bay reader family and subscribe I upload
every Monday Wednesday Friday at 6 p.m.
Pacific time if you're excited for this
video don't forget to give this a thumbs
up here we go alright so it is 9:30 in
the morning filming this on December
18th for those of you following along
the skin progress so variety washed and
prepped my skin I'll leave the products
I've been using down below I would say
right now my skin is more just normal
dry not super super dry or anything but
I haven't been getting oily throughout
the day so on half my face I'm gonna use
my eco tool sponge this color just
reminds me of like
Barney now on the other half I'm gonna
use my ELF ultimate blending brush I
need to clean all my brushes before I
leave on my strips I don't try the
lightest shade lc1 packaging of this
feels really nice it has a nice weight
to it
Oh twist off thought it was a bluff oh
dang is there not oh there's a wand what
the heck oh hell yeah this is like the
clinique wand whoa that's not what I was
expecting
whole healthy foundation thing Ken
reminds me of the covergirl vitalist and
just a description of this and
everything's this is supposed to be
medium to full coverage I'm actually
gonna start on this side I always start
on this side let's switch it up so I'm
just gonna go in and swipe don't know
how much to use with this let's start
with that there's not a whole lot coming
out on each swipe I'm gonna start out
with the brush on this side
the finish looks really nice looks like
a satin finish with that amount looks
like about hi medium coverage it's not
covering all of my scarring and freckles
it looks like nice natural coverage like
I would wear this amount out but I do
want to see if I can build it up a
little bit let's do the forehead first
it feels like it's almost between like a
gel in the liquid feels a little bit
similar to the Rimmel 24-hour foundation
has that kind of gel feel to it like it
doesn't feel like it's gonna really
slide around and it does have a stick to
it right now but we'll see if it sets a
little bit that's looking nice yeah it's
sitting on the skin beautifully I'm
liking this okay let's try this sponge
on this side if you want more coverage
brush is definitely the way to go with
this one that's looking like light
coverage yeah wow that was a big
difference look at that side compared to
that side
okay I'm switching to brush for sure I
might go back in and smooth it out with
a sponge but to get the kind of coverage
and everything I like brush is
definitely the way to go for me it says
this fragrance free it does have a scent
but it doesn't smell like a fragrance
scent it just has a little bit of a you
know what it smells like
like leaves their smell like it smells
like something you use in like cooking
not that I ever do that
so right on the center of my forehead it
seems like it's having a little bit of
trouble sticking right there I'm gonna
try and use a sponge with this yeah it
doesn't seem to want to stick right
there but everywhere else looking really
nice I just want to see if this builds
right here it doesn't really seem to
build a whole lot more so I think this
is one that I would just put on a little
bit more product if I wanted more
coverage right off the bat but I like
the way that this is looking on my skin
in the viewfinder it looks a lot more
pink in real life it doesn't look that
off right now it is looking beautiful it
looks very natural I love the way that
it's sitting on my skin coverage I would
say solid high medium coverage
I couldn't blend powder products on top
of this right now lately I've only been
setting this part of my face so I think
I'm gonna do that so that I can put on
my bronzer and everything so it's now
9:45 I'm gonna play the rest of my
makeup and I'll be you right back all
right so it's now 10 206 I need to
change my background we're still in fall
over here 1006 rest my makeups on I just
did something really natural natural ish
cuz I have a bunch of errands to run
today I'll tell you guys what's on my
face but first foundations looking
really great I think it looks beautiful
like I said I did set this part of my
face with my Laura Geller powder I
always use and everything blended out
beautifully but looking at everything
out close it looks like it's creasing a
little bit around my nose area starting
to so hopefully that doesn't get worse
throughout the day on the rest of my
face for bronzer I use the Catrice prime
and fine contouring palette this is an
ashy radiance and I also use the
highlighter in here why the heck do I
never use this this is beautiful
eyeshadow all I did was put the same
shade into my crease and then I put this
on the inner corner the blush ciate
summer love and then for lip so I'll use
it was this mac lipglass in the shade
under the sheets this is such a pretty
lip gloss that's what's happening right
now
so next check and I do will be in
natural lighting I'll see you guys in
few hours
alright so just film the intro and I
just wanted to let you guys know I was
kind of doing like a closed mouth smile
kind of thing for the thumbnail and I
did get a pretty big crease I think you
can see it on the viewfinder so just
wanted to note that I also have a little
one starting right here so hopefully it
doesn't increase any more we'll see okay
so it's now 140 so it's been on for a
little 4 hours do you guys look at this
highlight I can't get over this okay
let's talk about foundation so I am
getting creasing on my upper lip and in
that area that I showed you guys and
it's looking a bit more matte right now
mostly just in this area and like my
chin and stuff doesn't look quite as
dewy more of like a satin matte I think
that's in focus now no I haven't issues
so there is creasing right there and
right there a little bit not horrible
I'm getting a few lines right here I
don't usually crease like around this
area that much but I'm creasing right
there a little bit right there
what doesn't say the creasing is
horrible or anything right now but
only been on for like four hours so my
forehead still looks good
no major separation or anything on the
center so overall it still looks pretty
good I just don't usually get this much
creasing four hours in but we will see
how it looks by the end of the night all
right so I just walked in the door it is
8:40 so it's been on for about 11 hours
at this point overall it seems like it's
gotten more matte throughout the day
which is kind of odd not in a good or
bad way it just kind of doesn't look
quite as flattering as it did before it
seems like wherever I've kind of moved
my face it just kind of stays it almost
looks like I have pitted like pitted
acne scarring or something I'm gonna
zoom in I do definitely have some bumps
and stuff right here but it's kind of
like settling into any of the places
that as I talk it's just kind of stayed
right there I don't think it's really
showing up I definitely feel like it's
looking a little bit better on camera it
doesn't look bad my forehead doesn't
look bad but it has looked better it
just looks a little bit like dry or
something almost to me I don't hate it I
don't love it I just feel like I have
for my skin right now I have foundations
that I like a bit better on but it
doesn't look bad and I could see this
working really well for some people I
can't tell if this would wear well and
oily skin because of the fact that it's
kind of like mattified oddly throughout
the day or if my skin is just dry so
it's like kind of soaking up some of the
moisturizing properties in this
foundation I don't know man what do you
guys think this one let me know down
below what you think but not bad I like
the shade and everything and it hasn't
oxidized throughout the day so it's good
I think if I set my face with one of my
moisturizing setting sprays like the two
phase three and one that might help the
situation so that might be something
that I would try but if you guys enjoyed
