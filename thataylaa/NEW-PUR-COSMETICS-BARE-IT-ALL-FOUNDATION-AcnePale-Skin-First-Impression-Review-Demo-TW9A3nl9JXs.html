letter right now what happens if you
need to take a nap and fall asleep all
right so today it is foundation Friday
happy foundation Friday I just got back
in Seattle last night super late from
Houston so this is the first video I'm
filming in a few days feels good so
today we're going to be talking about a
brand new product from pure cosmetics
this is the bear a tall foundation
12-hour four and one skin perfecting
foundation so I have two shades here as
a shade porcelain and I also have light
which I'm gonna be swatching both of
these shades obviously have a different
background lighting everything again I'm
gonna dress all of that in a second but
let's just talk about good old
foundation for a second if you're new
here I do foundation Friday every single
Friday on my channel it's a first
impression video a whole foundation
Friday down below what words are hard
today I have a whole foundation Friday
playlist down below in the description
box so you can find pure cosmetics on
Ulta and on the pure cosmetics website
looking on also this product retails for
$39 on Ulta so as you get one fluid
ounce of product on their website but on
the pier cosmetics site and on the
actual bottle here it's as you get one
point five which is half a fluid ounce
higher than most standard foundations so
you actually get a ton of product in
here so they just launched this product
and they launched with ten shades so I'm
hoping they're going to expand the shade
range of it because 10 shades isn't
super great I don't know how deep the
deep shade is but I am wearing the
lightest shade porcelain all right so
it's watch time here's the pur cosmetics
bear doll foundation and porcelain the
lightest shade next over is the same
foundation in the shade light this is a
giant shade jump I feel like this should
be a few shades darker here's the tarte
rainforest of the sea foundation in
porcelain the lightest shade clinic
beyond perfecting foundation and
concealer and 0.58 cosmetics CC cream
and fair and then here's derma called
2:08 which is my closest shade match the
claims are a little bit different on
Ulta and on pur cosmetics so I'm just
going to radius them says this
high-performance
12 hour Demi matte foundation helps to
cover imperfections and instantly
perfective skin while helping to correct
problem areas over time so you can
confidently bear at all formulated with
Pyrrhus proprietary energy complex and
ceratin complex
doesn't say what those are this formula
renews the look of your skin and goes
the distance okay that told me nothing
about the product so the same thing I'm
peers website except it also says it
will not fade quit or crumble under any
condition you may face throughout your
day have you ever had your foundation
crumble I don't think that's a verb I've
ever associated with foundation 12 hours
supposed to be long lasting dummy Matt
doesn't really say anything about the
kind of coverage it is vegan gluten free
pure is cruelty free so I have
combination skin with cystic acne I get
pretty oily throughout the day on my
t-zone especially so I want to take 60
seconds to talk a little bit about
lighting and everything if you don't
give a about that you can fast
forward I'm going to put the timestamp
on the screen right here if you don't
want to hear it's a lighting spiel this
does have to do with the lighting and
quality of the videos and seeing my skin
and stuff so I do want your guys's
feedback and I want to hear your
thoughts so let me start off by saying
you guys know I have acne I want you to
be able to see my skin and videos that
is the whole point of effective
foundation videos in my opinion is to
actually see the foundation be able to
see your skin with that being said when
I film at home there is no way that I
can film solely with natural lighting
which is why I have studio lights almost
everyone has to film with studio lights
because cannot get high quality video
without having good lighting a lot of
studio lights especially if they're
really close to your face if you have a
small room or something
can really kind of blow out the image
and make your face look more flawless
and actually is that is not my goal I
want you to be able to see my skin I
want you to be able to see the texture
which is why I've been trying my best to
learn more about my camera fix the
aperture change the ISO do all this
stuff this is all trial in there when I
go to film
I don't just turn on studio lights and
press play I do not use filters I didn't
even know those existed for videos I
will never use filters for video that
defeats the whole purpose of actually
being able to see what I'm talking about
in the last few videos I lighting is not
perfect the white balance was majorly
off in a couple of them all these things
you cannot really see on the viewfinder
it's not until you import it into final
cut and have to tweak things around and
even then when you export it it looks
different than it doesn't final cut at
least on my computer I am trying my best
to have the best possible lighting
quality and everything for you guys that
looks realistic the office is a whole
other issue there's been major
constructions
on there which is why I'm filming here
for most videos lately in office there
are two big windows the way the
building's facing I still don't get
enough light there's definitely way more
natural light coming in in this room but
I still have to turn on the studio light
I'm determined to figure this out which
is why every single video has been
different lighting and settings and
everything let me know what you guys
think of this right now I'm totally
turned a different way than I normally
am I'm only using my ring light right
now in front the camera which is what I
used to film on and I can actually dim
it which is really great because then
when I'm showing close-ups it's not
totally blown out you can actually see
my skin so your feedback on the video
quality and image is always helpful for
me I just want you guys know that I'm
trying my best to show you my skin okay
I'm going to get this down very soon
fingers crossed all right that talk is
over if you're excited for foundation
Friday and make sure you give this video
a thumbs up so I know if you want to see
how the pur cosmetics Berra doll 12 hour
foreign one foundation applies somewhere
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching all right so
like usual I've already washed my
strides in prime my base use my jouer
anti blemish matte primer I actually
went to squirt this thing out and
there's a freaking slit in the bottom of
this and it's squirt all over my wall so
like normal I'm gonna use a foundation
brush on one side of my face and then a
sponge on the other this is actually the
pure cosmetic sponge I've used this a
bunch before I love this sponge all of
my foundation brushes right now are way
past due on needing to be washed instead
of my normal Sigma f80 I'm going in with
this elf brush basically this brush is
the least dirty of all my brushes right
now whoo
I like this squeeze too it's almost it's
a little bit holographic it reflects
like a rainbow which is exciting yeah
this is a big tube I do feel like right
now you can actually see the products
better like when I hold up this way you
can see jouer doesn't just look like a
white blob I have squeezed too I'm going
to squirt out about I don't know how
much coverage is has so let's start with
about a dime-size amount and it is thick
this is not going anywhere
so I'm start with a brush on this side
of my face I'm going to stipple like I
normally do it feels thick but
moisturizing and we are getting good
coverage
it smells like Elvis smells like dancing
waters it's also called up Bath and Body
Works scent super fresh smelling
yeah it's setting down very quickly it
looks like
a demi matte-finish right now I mean use
half the amount that I squared out there
so I'm just going to go in with a little
bit on the forehead with this one layer
on half my face with the brush is
looking like high medium coverage almost
full coverage to me it covered the
things that I want covered though I mean
it covered all my redness a lot of my
scarring and even some acne spots just
mostly just like freckles and stuff that
you can see coming through which I don't
mind I have a feeling this is going to
be buildable but right now it's looking
really nice on this side of my face more
of a matte finish for sure let's go in
with the sponge your hands up I like
this scent or if it should just be a
body lotion so I'm getting way lighter
coverage with the sponge yeah if you
want lighter coverage definitely go in
with a sponge with a sponge I would say
this looks like low medium coverage
maybe even high light coverage I'm
adding a little bit more with the sponge
to see if this is buildable and I might
go in with a brush if it's not the same
amount of coverage at the other side so
2 layers with the sponge is getting
about the same coverage as one layer
with a brush
I think this shade is actually kind of
spot on for me I would say this finish
is very flawless Demi matte doesn't look
cakey at all it's setting really quick
it almost feels like nothing on my face
but it doesn't look flat I mean you can
still see light reflecting off my face a
little bit the cool thing about using
the ring light is I can actually turn
down light when I get up close so you
guys can see my skin does you can see
there's still freckles and marks coming
through so it's not completely full
coverage off of one layer for me so if
you don't have major acne or scarring or
anything I think this would look full
coverage off of one layer for you I
could even just go in and spot conceal
but to see if it's buildable with the
brush I'm going to go in for a second
layer hoping this doesn't oxidize
because if it oxidizes it will
definitely be too dark but right now it
is matching pretty much perfectly have
some projects left over from the sponge
side so I'm going to go in for a little
bit of the second layer on this side
just to cover up the scarring and stuff
which is buildable definitely buildable
and it's still looking really nice
doesn't look heavy or cakey at all wow
I'm impressed right now for some reason
with the name Berra doll I thought it
was going to be more sheer coverage and
it doesn't say online or anything what
kind of covered it's supposed to be
alright so too late
years on we are at full coverage and it
is looking good I love the way my
forehead looks right now it's not
clinging to any dry patches on my
forehead at all kind of smoothing out
certain areas amiss with the brush the
center of my forehead
especially with Matt Foundation's is
where I can look very textured and a
little bit cakey normally and right now
it is looking totally smooth my forehead
looks great the only area that looks a
tiny bit heavy is around my nose area
and my upper lip so I'm gonna use a
sponge nothing major at all
this looks good I'm excited right now is
11:58 so 12 o'clock I'm getting a late
start today because I was working this
morning since this is a demi matte
finish and it says it's supposed to work
for 12 hours and it sets to almost a
powder finish I'm not going to set this
one with the powder so we're just going
to see how it wears throughout the day
so I'm gonna do the rest of my makeup
and then I'll show you guys the close-up
once all my makeup is on okay so it's
now 12 20 so like I said it didn't use
the powder blush bronzer highlight blend
it out beautifully on top it blends out
like you have a powder on doesn't stick
doesn't have that gross tacky feeling
when you try to blend powder on top it
pretty much totally sets down on its own
it still looks really nice and skin like
my forehead I am loving the way my
forehead looks it looks almost like
plump it kind of looks like the a
cosmetics CC cream in the sense that it
just looks really nice and plump and
healthy so here's the nose area is
talking about I don't think you can
totally oh there we go
pores right here in nose area but
nothing bad at all
right now I am feeling this one which if
you guys have seen any of my foundation
videos is pretty rare
we'll see how wears throughout the day
could be a total disaster by the end of
the day but right now I am really liking
this alright so on the rest of my face
to contour I use my Catrice Prime and
fine contouring palette I just did a
video on my favorite contour products
for pale skin if you missed that I will
put it in the eye over here every single
time I have to think which side my lip
ring is on slash I've been using this a
ton this is the Physicians Formula
butter blush in natural glow this is a
very very faint blush so it's probably
wouldn't show up if you have a darker
skin tone than I do highlight is my Mac
mineral skinfinish in lightscapade and
for eyeshadow I use the Too Faced sweet
sweet peach I want to know your guys
thoughts on them to face palette down
because I'm not I'm not that into it
Physicians Formula I booster from an
inner like normal and we'll also see how
this holds up throughout the day because
I've never tried this before this is a
new makeup forever liquid lipstick this
is in the shade 101 set it there no name
I like the weight that this one on dry
down in about a minute like the shade so
that is everything on my face right now
I'm going to check back in with you guys
the next check and I do will be in
natural lighting I'm going to keep this
on as long as possible I don't know if
I'm going to make it till 12:00 a.m. to
get the full 12 hours but we are going
to shoot for it
alright so does know 4 o'clock I'm
actually filming this check-in on my
iPhone but it's on the app that I use to
get 4k video so it should be really good
quality right now just went to run the
errands and in the car mirror it looks
really good to me it looks like a soft
focus foundation that has that kind of
blurring effect it is bizarre my only
really minor complaint right now is
around my nose is looking a tiny bit
textured limping on for four hours so
we'll see by the end of the night but
right now it is looking pretty much
flawless and I'm in love right now I
just love the way my forehead looks
normally I'm super textured up here just
looks very smooth and soft alright so it
is now 1022 so the foundation has been
on for almost ten and a half hours and
this is about my normal wear time 10
hours got my tea because it's freaking
freezing in here if you can't tell I
think it looks frickin amazing it's worn
really well throughout the day I usually
get pretty oily on my forehead and this
is very very mild for me especially not
using a powder at all I even think this
shininess literally just came in the
last half hour 2 hour because before
that still pretty much totally matte as
bronzer highlight still totally on
actually didn't get too much more
creasing on my upper lip at all but
around my nose area is the only part
where I think it could look a little bit
better I'm going to try using a pore
filling primer to see if I can make my
nose area look a little bit smoother and
less creepy throughout the day but
literally everywhere else looks great it
hasn't oxidized I think the shade is
perfect for me actually I usually don't
like a Demi matte finish but I think
this is almost time a soft focus satin
matte finish I would say if you like
that I think even if you have dry skin
this one might work because I mean it
really
made my forehead look great if you have
any kind of texture or anything this
just totally blurs it out in my opinion
since it almost kind of plugs my
forehead and didn't settle into any
lines I think more mature skin could
wear this one too I really like this
I am very pleasantly surprised right now
this was a major one for me and I am
shocked
wait asparagus for dinner and the oil
totally took off the liquid lipstick so
I did change my liquid lipstick I tried
the Sephora liquid lipstick this is in
the shade 33 I really like the
formalities and these are only 14 bucks
at the shade 33 and then it also has a
lightest one I think it's 22
I just watched The Bachelor Corrine and
Taylor getting intense and now I'm about
to edit this thing so if you guys liked
