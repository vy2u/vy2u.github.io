your notes is going to be two minutes we
should try like I needed another
eyeshadow palette I brought the polished
choice in Wayne Goss nude matte
eyeshadow palette I don't know why so if
you haven't heard of Wayne Goss which I
feel like everyone has but if you
haven't you've been living under a rock
probably Wayne Goss is a makeup artist
and he teamed up with polished choice to
create this bad boy I figured that if
he's going to put his name on something
it's probably going to be a good product
this is just gonna be a super quick
review because I really like this and I
think you should know about it is a
matte eyeshadow palette there is one
shadow which has a little bit of Sheen
to it all the rest are completely matte
and you can get it off with the polish
twice website which will be linked down
below it retails for $40 which i think
is a super good deal naked palettes
retail for 50 this is cheaper you get 12
shades and you also get a brush so
what's really cool is not only can these
be applied wet or dry but they are 100%
fragrance free and there's no animal
testing every time I record a video
there's a fire truck driving by
personally I like the design of the
packaging I was watching one review and
they said they didn't really like it I
like the simplicity of it and I like the
font I don't know but the quality of the
packaging isn't quite what I would like
it to be it is cardboard I don't like
that because you can't really clean it
and you can't bend this part back
without it you know breaking so I'm not
the biggest fan of the packaging it does
feel a little bit on the cheaper side so
when you open it up here's what the
eyeshadows look like if you want
detailed pictures and swatches those
will be on my blog which is linked down
below so this is what these shadows look
like there are twelve shades and then it
does come with this eye shadow brush I
am more of a fan of the brush than I
thought I was gonna be usually I don't
like really stiff shadow brushes which
this is but I actually really like the
way that it applied my lid
so you get kind of three light shades
this is the only semi sheen color in the
palette all the rest are completely
matte you have some good medium colors
I've used this one with a really big
fluffy brush then it kind of gives the
same effect as my morphe es 15 eyeshadow
which is like my go-to everyday crease
color this was probably the most
unappealing color to me I'm not usually
a fan of like cool Browns but when you
apply this it's like heaven on your eyes
it's like this weirdly appealing brown
color you have a gray and then also some
darker Browns so the texture of these
eyeshadows they're pretty soft and
blendable for being matte shades usually
mattes tend to be harder to blend out
didn't have any issues blending them out
I'm a fan of the texture for sure
good job wait in comparison to the Naked
basics palette which is also all mattes
this isn't even comparable for $27.00
versus $40 you get so many more colors
I'd much prefer this to the Naked basics
palette so yeah if you're into mattes
then I would definitely recommend trying
this out I really have no complaints
these are super wearable can go for an
everyday look or smoke it out depending
on what you're feeling you know thumbs
up for Wayne good job if you want to see

wearing right now then I will link that
