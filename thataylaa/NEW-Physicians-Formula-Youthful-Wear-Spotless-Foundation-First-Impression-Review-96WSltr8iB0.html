going to be on the Physicians Formula
Youth wear cosmeceutical youth boosting
spotless foundation and brush there's a
heck a lot of claims on here kind of too
much to handle so I picked this up for
1495 at Rite Aid which is pretty pricey
for a drugstore foundation so this is
supposed to be this new like youth
boosting serum foundation and this says
is a new innovation like I said a
ton of claims on here reduces the
appearance of spots by 67% look up to
ten years younger instantly I don't know
if I really want to look 10 years
younger because then I'm going to look
like I'm an 11 year old girl I mean I
have it on right now I don't know if I
really look instantly younger let me
know down below so let me just read you
some of their claims hypoallergenic
paraben free gluten free dermatologist
approved non comedogenic and clinically
tested 100% of the people tested saw
brighter and more even skin instantly
and then they have a lot of other claims
in which a hundred percent of the people
saw these amazing results so me being
myself decided to look up the word
cosmeceutical and see what that actually
means
so basically according to Wikipedia
cosmeceuticals are a blend of cosmetics
and pharmaceuticals which means
basically it's an advertising claim that
companies can use to make it sound more
pharmaceutical and like it's actually
going to make a difference on your skin
but the FDA doesn't even have to approve
it it also says that because it's
claimed as a cosmeceutical rather than
cosmetic product it often undergoes less
regulation than it would as a cosmetics
so that's also interesting it comes with
this serum with a little dropper and
then this like super mini kabuki brush
yeah you can keep watching and see for
yourself how this goes on make sure to
thumbs up this video if you like
impressions videos and leave me a
comment down below if you guys have
tried this and how you like it and if
you want to see how it applies and where
is throughout the day then just keep
watching
ooop it is first thing in the morning
right now and by first thing in the
morning I mean is 12:00 in the afternoon
got my girl's mug we're ready to rumble
it comes in this very secure packaging
right here with the brush and then the
serum and the directions say to shake
bottle before each use apply two to
three drops the foundation directly on
to the probe blending brush and apply by
blending with the brush until desired
coverage is achieved into finish with a
pattern okay so I guess we're going to
try it with this interesting brush the
fibers feel like the product is just
going to sink in here rather than
sitting on the top but we'll see and I
have the shade light the lightest show
you can make like always - like this
head I'm just going to shake it up I do
have a primer on my face right now the
L'Oreal magic Lumi primer woah okay
there's like nothing on the end directly
drop it on the brush lift a side one two
three interesting formula I thought is
going to be like a liquid it's going
just sitting there okay so we're just
going to do this whoa
super dark okay way too dark for my skin
let's just go with it
doesn't really feel like anything is
going on whoa
feels like completely dry on my skin
it's coming off on my finger directly
not quite sure how much you like this
brush I would say it has light coverage
for sure you can still see all of my
freckles and everything underneath it
this is clearly way too dark going to
take this big that it can we keep rush
buy more freshest I love this for
blending in foundation and I'm just
going to take the product put it on the
back of my hand okay it looks super
liquidy on there I don't know if I just
got like a chunky section I'm just going
to blend it in and see if this applies
differently I honestly can't see that
far away oh I feel like it's drying not
as dark it's still too dark for my skin
but doesn't look like orange and it
literally doesn't feel like I'm wearing
anything right now I'm kind of curious
why they say to set it with a powder
because it kind of dries to a powder
finish it smells like straight-up
chemicals too and do the same thing on
the other side it dries really fast like
on my hand it's already dry yeah I feel
like it's dry by the time it hits my
face maybe that's why they say to
directly apply it but I can't do the
smell dude I don't even know what that
is it's not normal kind of smells like
an old people home don't really have
enough time to like blend it in your
skin
since it does dry so quickly on anything
you put it on I'm going to try a
different method with the third time and
put it on my fingers so at least the
product is still wet when I'm applying
it to my face now feels just super
lightweight it doesn't really feel like
I'm putting anything on my face if
you've ever used if facial serum it does
feel pretty similar to that like super
lightweight and it just kind of absorbs
into your skin shade is definitely too
dark for me but I'm going to try and
keep it on because I don't think I'm
really going anywhere today we're going
to just go with it okay so I have
applied the rest of my makeup I used
instant age rewind concealer with the
Rimmel stay matte powder to finish it
since it does say to set it with a
powder it is now twelve twenty three in
the afternoon starting my day super
early so I will be checking in
throughout the day with updates so back
in the leopard robe is now 3:30 in the
afternoon the foundation I don't know
why I'm just not maybe if it was the
right color for my skin I mean it's
looking better on camera than it does in
real life the finish is nice it looks
like a natural finish which maybe is why
I don't like it because I usually go for
more full coverage I'm not getting oily
it's not creasing or anything so that's
nice oh I don't know what it is you know
when you just don't like something you
don't know why I'm just like the smell
or what I just feel gross and I feel
like I want to wash off my face right
now so this may be my last check-in I'll
see how much longer I can keep this on
my face it's not bad it's not a bad
product I just don't think it's for me
if you like a light to medium coverage
then I would try this out I guess that
it looks nice it's not getting oily it's
just not for me so if this is my last
check-in
thank you for watching click the thumbs
up button if you like this let me know
if it worked out for you guys if you
decide to try it some I don't know some
foundations just aren't meant to be you
know
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
