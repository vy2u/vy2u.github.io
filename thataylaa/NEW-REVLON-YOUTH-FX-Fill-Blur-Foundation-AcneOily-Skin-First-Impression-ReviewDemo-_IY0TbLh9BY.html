Friday according to the comments section
in last week's foundation Friday video
I'm pretty sure the barefaced intro one
versus coming on with the full face but
there are also a lot of people who like
the full face intro or who just didn't
care I personally like the full face
intro the other issue is doing it this
way is that I haven't had enough coffee
yet by the time I'm filming the intro so
I don't think I'm going to be doing this
every week but we're going to switch it
up every now and then so everyone's
happy but here we are today barefaced
intro for all of you people so for those
of you who are new here I do foundation
Friday videos every single Friday on my
channel 6 p.m. Pacific time so today
we're going to be talking about the
brand new Revlon youth FX I keep wanting
to say youth fix but it's definitely a
youth FX fill and blur foundation this
has SPF 20 in it it comes in 12
different shades I have this shaded 130
porcelain and 110 ivory which is the
lightest shade just to see the
difference I want to swatch both of them
for you guys not sure which one I'm
going to use on my face yet might do a
little cheeks watch situation the reason
why I've got 130 porcelain as well is
because in the Revlon Colorstay
foundation the shade 110 is super off
for me so I got this one at the back up
I'm going to quickly go on Revlon's
website to read some of the claims
like I said comes in 12 shades doesn't
look like it goes very deep at all I
initially was not drawn to this at all
was not going to pick it up because to
me it looks like a kind of tinted
moisturizer just the packaging and the
name vibe and everything I just thought
it was going to be super light coverage
tinted moisturizer a kind of situation
but on the display it says this is
supposed to be full coverage so we will
see it says lightweight hydrating
formula works to fill in and blur lines
and wrinkles with micro fillers in
optical diffusers so this is supposed to
be kind of a mature skin anti-aging kind
of foundation I don't think there's
actually anti-aging properties in here
it's more just for blurring as the
appearance of lines and wrinkles are
smooth this right hand is a smooth
smooth smooth right now this high
coverage foundation erases the look of
uneven tone age spots and
hyperpigmentation
looks freshly applied all day doesn't
settle into lines some insert swatches
right here
of the shade 110 and 130 compared to
some of the other latest foundation
shades that I on alright this watch time
right here is the Revlon youth effects
foundation in 110 right next to it is
the same foundation in the shade 130 Mac
Stover's derma called 2:08 this is my
perfect foundation shade match Urban
Decay Naked skin foundation is 0.5 and
Loreal Pro matte foundation in the
lightest shade the downside to this
thing is that it retails for anywhere
between 16 and 20 dollars for a freaking
drugstore Revlon foundation you get one
fluid ounce of product in here which is
standard for any foundation I just think
that price point is a little bit absurd
especially for not having any extra
anti-aging benefits or ingredients I
paid a little over 17 bucks for this at
CVS when I'm filming this it was buy one
get one half off but $17 in my opinion
is slightly ridiculous for a drugstore
foundation that's like almost the price
of a clinic foundation here we go so
I've already washed moisturize in prime
my face use the hilum ID mat 12 primer
set it right this time
Hylan wide so I've been using every
single day to prime my face I need more
coffee right now on one side of my face
I'm gonna use my ELF foundation brush
because they have heard this is more of
a thick formula and with say formulas
this is usually the brush that I go for
and on the other side we use my morphe
sponge over here so I'm going to first
cheek swatch 110 since I have not
swatched these yet look at my neck that
already looks like it's going to be a
good match but let's try 1:32 my skin
right now is not great I'm getting some
major cystic breakouts down here okay
this is weird is it just me or does 130
look lighter than 110 it's definitely
more yellow so if you're more fair with
yellow undertones you might want to go
for shade 130 instead of 110 think I
still prefer shade 110 just because it
looks like it has a little bit more of
neutral undertone so that's what I'm
going to go in with I think even the
bottle on these the bottle of 130 looks
a little bit lighter okay this thing is
frickin sick you squeeze it out of there
it is not moving so I'm going to start
out on this side with my foundation
brush so let's go to town why do I feel
like I'm forgetting to do something
right now super thick it almost feels
like a mixture of a thick cream and a
gel foundation ooh I'm getting good
coverage though just the feel of this
this
didn't feel like one that I would want
to build up this in that area where I
started to build it up a little bit it
got a little bit streaky but I don't
think you really need to because I'm
getting great coverage so it feels
pretty sticky but it looks really nice
and smooth the kind it looks like a
tinted moisturizer and put a little bit
more out so I can get my forehead I did
use that whole amount they did use a
decent amount to get that coverage feels
really thick and almost sticky to blend
out ooh that looks good on my forehead
it just covered my major cystic acne
right here really well I'm getting
coverage but the finish of this still
looks very natural to me like I said it
looks just kind of like a tinted
moisturizer brushfire sponge I did get a
little bit better coverage on the brush
side this side to me looks full coverage
this side looks like high medium
coverage you can still see my freckles
and stuff coming through over here I'm
going to add a little bit more on this
side with a brush and just if we can
build it up a little bit yeah this is
not one that I would build up it just
kind of has that feel to it and I'm
getting some texture when I try and do
that I would say if you want coverage
just put on a decent amount to start
with like I did on this side and a brush
will definitely give you better coverage
so here's what it looks like up close at
this point it's not settling in anywhere
it looks really good on my upper lip
around my nose area center of my
forehead looks great right now it's 8:35
in the morning I'm curious to see if
this one is going to set at all because
right now it feels a bit sticky it's
definitely not at the point where I
could blend product on top of it so I
think I will need to set at least my
cheek area with a powder I like the way
my whole face is looking right now it
looks very natural and just skin like so
like I said right now it's about 8:30
I'm going to put on my concealer the
rest of my makeup and I'll be right back
alright so I just finished up the rest
of my face and it's now 9 o'clock so
that's when we're calling the check-in
time I did end up powdering my face
because when I put on my concealer and
there's vacuum hopefully you guys can't
hear that my face super easily gets
weird texture from creams and powders
and stuff with certain foundations and
concealers and when I put on my
under-eye concealer and my
powder I definitely got that separation
where you can kind of see the difference
between my foundation and concealer and
powder so I did have to powder my entire
face to make it look normal they use the
Laura Geller balance and Brighton
Foundation I also love the Lord eller
double take base but this one goes more
of like a luminous finish I love this
it's been lost for like months and I
just found it so yes but once I put the
powder on it took a couple minutes to
have everything kind of warm up to my
skin but once it did it looks freakin
amazing it doesn't look like I have a
powder on top it looks really good
around my nose area upper lip all of my
problem areas basically it looks great
on and I have combination skin so I do
get oily throughout the day so we'll see
how this holds up I have no complaints
right now so on the rest of my face try
it out the new bare minerals invisible
bronze this is the fair to light shade
and I feel like I have to play around
with this more I'm not quite sure if I
like the tone of it yet but I don't not
like it blush Oh dead away yep blush I
use the candy Queen of Hearts blush by
makeup revolution I've been really into
this one I want like a little bit of a
glow on my cheeks and then for a
highlight I used my secret beam
highlighter by etude house you can get
this on Amazon it's amazing totally
underrated eyeshadow i use the morphe
35o our palette this is a super basic
eye and went in with a few shades from
that and then lips I use Tarte and
namaste mixed with Dubai by Oprah
cosmetics this one is way too
 brown on my skintone by itself so I
had to mix in a little bit of this too
like pinky what add some peachy pink in
there so nine o'clock check in next
reckon I do will be a natural lighting
I'm actually going to the hair salon
today to get some more extensions added
just the back of my hair so I don't know
if she's going to be like washing my
hair and stuff but I'll do a check in
afterwards just in case any of it like
rubs off and I have to reapply or
anything so I will see you guys in a few
hours alright so it is 2:30 pretty much
in the afternoon right now so the
foundations go on for a little over 5
hours 7 half hours I just got more
extensions put in love them she actually
didn't have to wash my hair at all we
just placed a few more extensions so the
foundation hasn't been altered at all
I'm in a parking garage right now I'm
about to go into home goods so the
shadows are kind of weird but hopefully
you can still see so there we go that's
a little better
I love it I think it looks beautiful it
is coming off a bit on my sore
right here where we were playing with my
bangs and stuff that's the only part
where it's rubbing off everywhere else
it looks really good there's no creasing
on my upper lip or anything I'm gonna
zoom you guys in there's a dude sleeping
next to me in the car right now I think
my forehead looks nice overall I think
it just looks natural it's not the most
full coverage but it has enough coverage
for me it's covering my acne and I just
love the finish of it I think it looks
just very natural and skin like and kind
of dewy if you like more matte products
you definitely won't like this it's more
like a dewy moisturizing looking
foundation but right now I'm feeling it
so I'm going to go into home goods and
when try and edit for a bit in the car
and then I'm meeting my friend over here
in Bellevue for dinner / happy hour so I
will check back in with you guys at the
end of the night all right so it's now
7:30 well this is a fail it's 7:30 p.m.
I'm gonna have to take my word for it
there we go
the Foundation's been on for 10 and a
half hours at this point I don't think
it looks bad I don't think it's the best
most long-wearing foundation I own the
forehead is just kind of like worn off
in certain places there's not any major
creasing on my upper lip and around my
nose area looks pretty good I do feel
like it's just kind of rubbed off in
certain areas where my foundation
doesn't usually come off that much like
on the side of my face right here but I
wouldn't say that this looks bad by any
means I don't know how this would hold
up in major humidity and like summer
heat because we had a pretty mild day
today it was like 70 degrees and it
wasn't sunny and I was inside for most
of the day so it really didn't get a
whole lot of wear in weather but my
forehead doesn't look overly oily it
just looks kind of dewy still I do
really love how this sits on my skin and
I like how it goes on I think if you
have dry skin this could work really
well because it is very moisturizing for
me I don't think this is one that I
would wear for long long days I'd
probably wear this if I want just like
five six hour makeup or if I'm not
wearing any other makeup and I just want
to even out my skin tone because I do
like how it looked before I put on
concealer and everything as well without
a powder but it is very sticky so if you
don't like feeling your foundation you
probably wouldn't like this even with a
powder on it is very sticky here's two
dudes watching me vlog this is awesome
