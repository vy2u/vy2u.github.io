talking about the brand new Rimmel 16
our private lives for some reason that
name just made me think of Spy Kids
provocative secret agent Spy Kids so
we're gonna be talking about these brand
new lip products from Rimmel I actually
bought these because I bought their
other like a puck I think they're
apocalypse or something matte lip thing
those did not last on me at all they
came right off so I wanted to try the
16-hour ones I'm all about the
long-lasting lip color as soon as I saw
Rimmel came out with these I was on it I
got two shades the first shade is 110
dared a pink which is what I'm wearing
on my lips right now and then the second
shade is I'm having such issues
heartbreaker
I do like this one it's not as deep as I
thought it's a little bit brighter it's
kind of like a bright orange red not a
huge fan of the color of this one but I
do really like the color of the one I'm
wearing right now so looking on rebels
website says it's supposed to be sixteen
hours of wear kiss proof transfer Crew
food proof no tight feeling or dry lips
and it's supposed to come up with an
oil-based makeup remover I don't have
issues getting these off with my
Neutrogena wipes wash one other video on
these and they said that theirs was like
seven dollars or six dollars at Bartels
where I got these these were I think
nine dollars each so around seven to
nine dollars from the drugstore I would
say I do really like the packaging of
these I think they're really cute did I
say they come in a shade innominate
shades so I am going to show you a quick
shot of me applying this one just so you
can see how it goes on so I'm going to
be applying the shade dared to pink to
stuff is pretty freakin liquidy you can
kind of see it coming off the brush
expected more of like the Lime Crime
consistency it's definitely not that
it's definitely label my bottom lip
right now is still not dry this now
starting to get kind of Chucky once it
starts drying it feels a little bit
sticky yeah so the other end which I'm
all about little lips on annex end is
the same it's just a doe foot applicator
it looks kind of like weirdly waxy the
formula but it goes on really nice it
actually is like the perfect consistency
it doesn't feel like an obnoxious gloss
but it gives you the glossy finish and
it feels like it kind of locks
everything in I've worn these a few
times now and overall thoughts they
definitely are kiss proof transfer proof
and food proof are gonna do the kiss
test right now completely kiss proof
only like a little bit of the shiny top
coat comes off one thing that I wish was
different was I wish they also made a
matte top coat I think that'd be awesome
if they came out with it just a separate
matte top coat that you could buy to put
over it you definitely need the top coat
to go over it because without it the
product is sticky it definitely feels
like it needs something to lock
everything in we just do a food test
let's do a food test he wouldn't have to
dip your hand in the pickle juice float
over here pickles are like the second
greatest food on planet earth behind
burritos go fully on I feel like there's
not it much more I can say about these
besides that they do say what they do
you do what they do do what they say
they do there we go
only criticism is that sometimes I feel
like it really settles in the lines of
your lips I do think the glossiness
helps to kind of distract from that but
if it was just Matt you would definitely
be able to see some major lip lines
going on overall for the price being
drugstore and super long-lasting I think
these are awesome I think you should
pick these up if you see them and I
think Ramona needs to come out with more
colors let me know down below what your
guys favorite shades are or if you have
any other favorite long-lasting lip
products if you want to see how to get
the make up look I'm wearing right now
it is actually two separate videos I'll
link them both down below the first one
is how to contour and highlight second
one is what I did on my eyes right now
love you guys thanks for watching and
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
