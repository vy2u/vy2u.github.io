brand-new Coastal Scents revealed 2
palette you can ignore the eyebrows that
need to be plucked and lack of nail
polish on the phalanges because it's
finals week Balian option so just to be
transparent with you guys Coastal Scents
did contact me to see if I wanted to
review this I was like hell yeah looks
interesting and now we're here I don't
have to say good things about it I
didn't even have to make a video about
it so there we go you guys know I don't
sugarcoat things so this is brand new on
the Coastal Scents website it retails
for 1995 and you get 20 I shadow so
before I open it and show you guys the
colors and give you my thoughts let's
talk about the packaging so it has this
flip open kind of palette cardboard
casing obviously not the most durable
for $20 you're not going to get like
bulletproof fricking casing like you get
with the Naked 3 palette but it'll do I
did already drop mine and no harm done
so I guess that's a good sign right so
here are the 20 I shadow shades that you
get you have a super nice mixture of
matte shades and shimmer shades I feel
like the color scheme they were going
for is kind of like The Naked 3 palette
except with more options basically if
you haven't seen the Naked 3 palette
give you a quick look that's what it
looks like I feel like there's pretty
much dupes for every single shade in
here besides besides trick that's the
only shade that I don't think that you
really get in this palette so as far as
I can tell you get 5 matte shades a few
satin finishes and then a few super
sparkly glittery ones like this guy
right here so I've been wearing this for
the past few days now I'm wearing it on
my eyes right now so let me give you my
cell first off let's talk about the
matte shades in this palette they are
freaking beautiful the texture of these
is super velvety super soft easy to
blend out they don't feel chalky
whatsoever
the shade right here is pretty much an
exact dupe for mac and bark which I'll
show you right now so there are the two
next to each other I would say that this
one's even more pigmented
easier these are probably the nicest
matte shades and I've ever worked with
I'm wearing this shade on my crease
right now these two on my lid this
embark like one in my outer-v I'm
obsessed with the matte shades I would
buy the palette just for the matte
shades there you go
super pigmented super buttery the matte
shades are amazing I have no problems
with the shimmer shades besides this one
right here which I'm wearing on my eyes
right now you can see how flaky it is I
have to literally press it because if
you swatch it there's a ton of
fallout everywhere so this shade what I
did on my eyes right now is I sprayed a
little bit of fix+
put it on my brush and then pluck this
guy on my lid because if not you get
fallout everywhere that's really the
only shade in this palette where you do
get way too much fallout the lightest
shade right here is perfect for the
inner corner I also use this all over my
face as a highlight on my cheekbones
down the bridge of my nose I actually
used this shade right here to contour my
cheekbones gives you a nice kind of
natural contour it's not going to be a
bronzer it's more of like a sculpting
color
I wish the black shade didn't have
shimmer in it I always like good matte
black this one has a little bit of
sparkle again I think they're trying to
be Naked 3 palette
esque and copy Blackheart over here
these shades are right up my alley I
love warm pink tones and mobs and topes
perfect colors in my opinion you can do
so many different looks with this
palette so good to travel with you can
do a simple matte i spiced it up and do
a shimmery warm smoky eye whatever
you're feeling just watch a few of the
shimmery shades for you guys just so you
can see so there we go if you are a
person who likes warm toned eyeshadows
and these colors look appealing to you I
would definitely definitely recommend
trying out this palette for $20 I think
that's a super good deal if you haven't
bought the Naked 3 palette yet I think
this is a great dupe for that I don't
even really use my Naked 3 palette to be
honest because I don't like the texture
of a lot of the eyeshadows it's just not
that great to me this I will be reaching
for much much more if you want to see a
look using this palette be sure to
subscribe to my channel because I will
be posting a Shadrin schmoes get ready
with me video coming up
using this bad boy if you guys like this
video and it was helpful for you be sure
to give it a thumbs up so I know comment
down below if you've tried out the
revealed palette or you want to try it
out and what your thoughts are because
curious to know love you guys thanks for
watching T in my next video buddy gave
me these I love makeup decals which I
feel like you would be able to tell if
you looked at my face but if not I could
always put this on my car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
