Friday this is where I test out a new
foundation every single Friday on my
channel this is actually the first
foundation Friday since after 15 days
and foundation ended so we are back
super quick announcement before we jump
into the foundation today I'm actually
gonna be starting accutane I'm pretty
sure the week this video goes up I have
been doing my best to pre-record as many
foundation Friday videos as I can before
starting accutane when you start
accutane your skin gets super super dry
super sensitive I'm probably not gonna
want to be putting foundation on for the
first couple months I'm assuming so
we're just gonna kind of play it by ear
see what foundation videos I can film
while I'm on accutane but I might be
taking a little skin break so I have
been working really hard to get
hopefully a couple months worth of
foundation Friday videos eight videos
pre-filmed foundation Friday might be
every other week we'll see but I think
if I can get a couple months worth done
that should give me time hopefully to be
able to put foundation on I like the two
month point I'm gonna be documenting
every single month on accutane I'm gonna
be having a whole acne story coming out
so you can just follow along the whole
process it might be kind of exciting for
some of you because I've had combo oily
skin for years now so my skin is gonna
be changing on accutane I've heard even
when you get off of it your skin is more
normal to dry so different foundations
will probably be working for me that
didn't work in the past and vice versa
because the timeline is gonna be like
weird for you guys watching foundation
Friday videos gonna be a little
disclaimer in each pre-recorded video
just saying it's pre-recorded my skin
will obviously be in a different
condition hopefully in real life at that
point so if you're excited that
foundation Friday videos are still
continuing don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up it helps me out let's
hop into today's foundation but today
we're gonna be talking about the Milani
conceal imperfect two-in-one foundation
I actually have two videos using this
foundation one review when this first
came out a couple years ago in the shade
zero one that used to be the lightest
shade
I freaking searched for like a half hour
trying to find it I have no idea where
it is but when it first launched the
shade zero one was the lightest shade
that is the darkest lightest shade I've
ever seen in my life that shade was
unwearable even real
mixing in with products it was still too
dark so then they came out with the
shades zero zero light natural a few
months ago about eight months ago I have
a shadow and shmooze using this this one
still way dark very yellow Milani shade
range tends to pull pretty yellow so
then they came out with the shade zero
zero a I don't know who is making these
shades but like what are you gonna do
again to the negatives so this is the
newest shade as of a couple weeks ago it
says for fair with neutral pink
undertones they also came out with the
shades zero zero B light that says for
fair with yellow undertones the shade
zero one is actually my perfect shade if
I have self-tanner on so that's
typically the only time I reach for that
foundation because it's one of the few
foundations that I actually have a dark
enough shade for if I'm self-tanning
I was never super super wowed by this
foundation but I did like it enough to
where when I had the tanner on so I have
used this foundation probably about five
times over the years so we're gonna try
it again today see how it wears see what
I think of it I still get a ton of
questions about this foundation so I
figured we would go ahead and just do a
full video on it again it's an updated
video see if my thoughts have changed at
all
so I can show you guys swatches of the
new shade so I'm gonna search swatches
right here of the shade zero zero a and
zero zero compared to some of the other
foundations that I own all right it's a
swatch time right here's the Milani
foundation in the new lightest shade
zero zero a porcelain next to it was the
previous lightest shade the second time
around zero zero again I don't have the
zero one shade to swatch so I apologize
but it's about four shades darker than
this one Urban Decay Naked Skin
Foundation and zero point five
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless in
110 derma called 2:08 milk makeup blur
liquid foundation in fair pur cosmetics
bear doll in porcelain and Marc Jacobs
remarkable in ten so as you can see the
new lightest shade is pretty light as
close to Marc Jacobs ten might even be a
tiny bit lighter and Marc Jacobs ten is
very fair so I'm milania's website this
foundation retails for ten dollars you
can find it cheaper on other websites
I think Walmart and Target it's like
seven or eight bucks right now it comes
in 19 shades which is pretty great for a
drugstore foundation at the description
it says combat under-eye circles redness
and other skin imperfections with this
full coverage water resistant foundation
plus concealer in one works around the
clock to keep skin looking naturally
perfect that's all the claims I'm
willing my original review down
and also the shadow in schmooze that I
use the other shades in just so you guys
can see those shades in action but
perhaps do Milani for actually coming
out with more shades feel like just by
the numbering of their original shades
probably weren't initially planning on
coming out with a zero-zero a and B I
don't know I just feel like you would
start your line at like 1 or 0 so I feel
like they actually listen to people and
came out with more shades who knows
that's what I'm gonna believe so if
you're excited for this video and you
want to see how the Milani conceal and
perfect two-in-one foundation apply
somewhere throughout the day you're in
the right place just keep watching all
right I filmed last night like less than
10 hours ago so I definitely still have
some eyeliner on but I tried to get it
all off I've already washed moisturize
and I actually primed half of my face
today I primed this side of my face a
little bit more modified and my pores
are tiny bit more blurred out I used the
Revlon Photoready producing primary
typically in all my foundation videos I
just do primer all over I think I'm
gonna start doing half face just so you
guys can see if there's a difference and
so we know if any of the ingredients are
not agreeing with each other or whatever
so I think that's what we'll be doing
from here on out let me know what you
guys think of that so I'm gonna go in
with 0/0 a porcelain the new lightest
shade I have not swatch this yet or
anything so then you have my face with
the brush and half of the sponge oh this
actually looks light
good job Milani I'm gonna swatch this
because it looks like it might be I
might add in a tiny tiny bit of zero
zero light natural because I think
that'll be too light so let's do that
I'm gonna just squirt in like a dab
because this shade wow yeah you guys
will have already seen swatches but
there's a huge difference between zero
zero and zero zero a so shade zero zero
is still too dark for me but I think
mixing in some of this will be good zero
zero a does look pretty pink toned like
it says so that's good okay so I would
start out on this side to sponge first
oh let's go and fog and I do have the
natural light coming in right now again
so hopefully you guys can really see
everything so every time I've worn this
foundation on me it doesn't look like
complete full coverage you can
definitely still see my acne and some
freckles and stuff coming through so I'm
going to try my ELF ultimate blending
brush on the other side with this you
know this covers all the acne over here
I'm like
really breaking out right now I feel
like I'm actually getting better
coverage with the sponge on this one
yeah right now I definitely like how
it's going on better with a sponge I'm
going to switch back to it is that a
little bit more I feel like the product
goes further with the sponge as well
doesn't look particularly good or like
smoothing around my nose but I mean the
center of my forehead looks pretty good
I like how my foreheads looking I still
have some left over on the palate so I'm
just gonna take a little bit down on my
acne and see if it builds built up a
little bit acne you still coming through
I think if I wore this I would use a
spot concealer on top but the center of
my forehead actually looks really nice
right now seems to be kicking up a
little bit around my nose the pores are
definitely bigger on the not prime side
right now it's not looking quite as
matte as I remember so we'll see if it
kind of sets down in a few minutes but
right now it is 8:35 a.m. already did
the Starbucks round and by the way did
you know that Starbucks has Bagel Bites
where have I been this whole time I'm
not gonna powder my face with this one
because every time I've worn it with the
powder it gets way too heavy and cakey
looking but I am going to take a few
minutes and let this just set down
before I do the rest of my makeup right
now it's feeling pretty tacky still so
I'm gonna give it a few minutes I'll be
back once the rest my makeup is Oni it
is now 9:15 we're calling the check-in
time 8:40 since that's when I finish up
my face like I said did not set it with
the powder I feel like I look very dewy
right now like on my forehead I don't
mind it I like that kind of glow but I
do have combination skin so I get oily
throughout the day so I'm hoping I'm not
like super super oily like I said every
time I've tried this with the powder it
does look a bit heavy
overall for me right now I think it
looks nice it doesn't look that great
around my nose area and I think for me
it's just one of those that I mean
everything is just still coming through
so I probably wouldn't wear this without
mixing something in with it still or
adding spot concealer or something on
top oh just notice this was like raised
on the rest of my face I used the hood
of beauty desert desk palette I went in
with muss cuz I was a film ya mus code
and like gold with the gold glitter
shade everything is backwards right
there and
my inner corner I used the hourglass
absolute strobe light palette which I am
in love with I've been reaching for this
almost every day also what I have as a
highlight blush I use the essence blush
up in pinky flow for bronzer I tried out
the essence mosaic compact powder again
I used both of those in the essence one
brand tutorial which will be up before
this video will definitely sing this in
rays and rejects this month this is the
L'Oreal infallible mattes tongue-tied I
actually put a little bit of Mac faire
bling over top just to give it a tiny
bit of dimension so the next second I do
will be a natural lighting in a few
hours I will see you guys then okay so
it's 3:40 right now so it's been on for
seven hours I totally missed the first
check-in but it basically started
looking super shitty and breaking down
probably like four hours and I noticed
it breaking down
my forehead is shit-ton around my oh
dude that looks bad
yeah around there it is completely
broken up taking up
my forehead what is going on right here
it's like rubbed off is kind of settling
into my lines
I am super oily very oily for only seven
hours I noticed the oil starting to come
through at like the three hour point I
didn't like how it looked before I went
out I'm stuck here and that was what
time I didn't think of that 11:30 so at
that point it had only been three hours
and that's when I started not looking so
great yeah not looking good I don't
think I'd reach for this one again
unless I found a powder that it works
well with but we'll keep it on until the
end of the night I'll see you guys in a
few hours oh my god it actually looks so
bad around my nose looks like I have
twenty five thousand layers of
foundation on mm-hmm
with like oil with like coconut oil
slather on top of it okay so it's only
like ten minutes later but I'm actually
gonna end this video here because we're
gonna go out to dinner and I'm
definitely not keeping this on my face
right now it looks pretty shifty
Dee looks pretty pretty bad I don't have
a whole lot more to say about it other
than you can see how frigging oily I am
it's just majorly breaking down so let
me know if you guys have tried this what
you think of it do you like it with a
specific powder if you have oily skin
does this make you super oily because
this is a little bit ridiculous
