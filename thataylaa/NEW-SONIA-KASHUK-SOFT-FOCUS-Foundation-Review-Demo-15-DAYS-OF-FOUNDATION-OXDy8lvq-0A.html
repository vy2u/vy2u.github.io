is foundation favorito if you watch the
entire last series let me know down
below if you're new here let me know
down below I love talking to guys and
getting to say hi if you're new
leave a comment we could be friends
alright I think I've said everything I
need to say let's get on to the star of
the show so today we're going to be
talking all about the
brand-new Sonia Kashuk soft-focus satin
matte foundation this retails for $12.99
you can get Sonia Kashuk at Target they
are cruelty free I am looking online so
I can read some of the claims there are
only six shades in this foundation which
is pretty lame it doesn't go light which
you guys will see in the swatches and it
also doesn't look like it goes very deep
at all either I have the shade bisque
one I'm going to insert some swatches
right here so you can see how this
foundation compares to some of the other
foundations that I own right here we
have the Sonia Kashuk foundation in 0/1
bisque right here is Revlon Colorstay in
110 here we have the Josie Maran Argan
foundation and lightest shade this is
smashbox to do skin in 0.5 and this is
Clinique beyond perfecting foundation in
0.5 typically liquid foundations come
with one fluid ounce of product that's
like very standard this only has 0.8 8
fluid ounces so you get a little bit
less it says it's perfect for oily and
combination skin types that is what I
have says it's medium to full coverage
shine free and silky smooth creamy yet
lightweight anti-aging formula so as a
delivers fullest looking skin with a
matte but not flat finish this
foundation is infused with blue lotus
Daisy flower in mallow extracts to
nourish protect and brighten dull skin
so that's all the claims on here if you
guys want to see my thoughts and how
this foundation applies and wear
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching all right
morning pump up is over so I'm going to
prime my face using the jouer anti
blemish matte primer this is what I'm
going to be using every single day
during this series I love this primer I
don't think it alters the foundation
really it doesn't do a whole lot for
your pores I just feel like it's helped
my skin and it just preps the skin and
serves as a nice base i naired my face
this morning so it feels like a frickin
baby's butt right now so while that's
soaking in if you're new here I have
combination skin I usually get pretty
oily in my t-zone throughout the day
I have very acne prone skin I've had
cystic acne for years my skin is
actually pretty good right now for me so
I've the shade zero one bisque
I haven't swatch this for myself yet so
I'm not sure what the shade is gonna be
like hoping it's light enough I was
going to put some on the back of my
palette this is a bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks
candle lid that I use well pretty runny
she looks kind of light I'm just going
to put two pumps out to start we'll see
so on one side of my face I'm going to
use a kabuki brush on the other side I'm
going to use this Real Techniques
diamond sponge this brush is by aoa
studio it's a $1 kabuki brush I'll link
it down below along with everything else
I use and talked about in this video
never try to Sonia Kashuk foundation so
I'm excited have I no I don't think so
it's spreading pretty far the shade
looks like it has a little bit of yellow
undertone to it okay it's already way
oxidizing looks way darker than when I
first put it on my face so there's still
a lot of stuff coming through down here
it's sitting really nice on the skin
looks almost like a gel foundation I
used up about 3/4 of the product that I
had on here just on one half of my face
I'm going to try this huge a side I've
never tried this one obviously it's
white ooh okay that just covered half of
my face in like literally three seconds
for my forehead I'm going to turn it and
use this side so here's one layer brush
side sponge side I think I'm actually
liking the sponge side better coverage
looks about the same on both sides off
of that one layer I would say about low
medium coverage you can still see
freckle scarring shade wise it is
definitely a bit dark I would say about
a shade too dark it darkens after you
apply it to your face which is a little
interesting I'm going to go back in with
a sponge for the second layer use this
pointed side again or whatever getting
more coverage wouldn't say it's full
coverage with the second layer with a
second layer I think we got about a
solid medium coverage not full coverage
by any means not even high medium
coverage and still see a lot coming
through down here I feel like this is
darkening nine-minute I do want to do a
concealer on camera so I can see how
this sponge works with concealer so I'm
gonna use a Tarte shape tape like I
normally do this side wait yeah this
side you're supposed to also you be able
to use a bank let's try this the sponge
is super soft
if you like I have more control with the
other side we're not gonna apply
concealer on the center of my face to
highlight like a normally would because
I want to see just how the foundation
works let's use this to set with powder
why not
wow I got a lot of powder actually
really like how that applied the powder
it looks very like flawless right now
under there I think I am going to set my
face today I think I need to light in my
face a little bit with some powder and
also I don't know this one just kind of
feels like I need to set it so
throughout this whole series if I choose
to set my face with the powder I'm going
to be using one of three powders because
I know how these powders perform I love
all three of these I've talked about two
of these in the wrap-up video so just
depending on the foundation that I'm
wearing how I'm feeling I'm going to go
with one of these three so the first one
is the cover effects illuminating
setting powders is an awesome loose
powder it is on the lighter side so if I
want to lighten a foundation a little
bit I'll usually go in with this this is
the a cosmetic celebration foundation
illumination in the shade fair done
through like five of these and then the
third which I haven't actually talked
about on my channel I don't think this
is the laura geller double-take baked
versatile powder foundation in porcelain
this powder I've been using pretty much
any time I set my face in the last four
weeks I would say really like this it
gives really nice like airbrush kind of
finish this one is definitely the most
matte out of the three powders the other
a little bit illuminating I love all
three of these I think today I'm going
to use this cover FX one because this is
the lightest and we need some lengthen
my powders on it is 948 let's call the
check-in time 10 o'clock I'm going to
apply the rest my makeup and I will be
right back alright so the rest of my
makeup is on what time is it so now 10
18 oh I did that hella fast so much I
was on the rest of my face in a second
but let's take a look at the foundation
really quick so right now it looks fine
honestly it looks really average to me
before the powder I would say it was
like a satin matte matte finish right
now if the powder is looking pretty
matte no major thoughts right now it
just looks very average so on the rest
of my face to contour I use the Too
Faced cocoa contour palette in the light
shade no medium cocoa right here cheeks
I use Tarte Idol I thought this was like
a blush bronzer kind of thing and it is
like a straight-up highlight I don't
know if you guys since
you that but my cheeks are like very
luminous right now highly hourglass
diffused light and then I I used the
morphe the little palette this isn't a
shade coffee toffee i talked about these
on snapchat but these are freakin bomb
you guys
I like these way better than the morphe
palettes haven't checked to see if the
formulas different on these yet but it
feels like it is they feel super buttery
super pigmented have five different
shade things of these so all the
eyeshadow on my eyes right now is from
this little guy lashes are the Cara 48s
that I've been obsessed with and then
lift is this new Jacob UD lip finiti
matte lip and this is in the shade
last night single dear lord please let
that be true the formula is super thin
when it goes on feels pretty drying but
we'll see how it wears throughout the
day right now is 1022 we're calling the
check in time ten o'clock since that's
when I finished the foundation I'm just
gonna work at home today get some worked
in here next check and I do will be in
natural lighting so you can see how it
looks in daylight
I will check back in throughout the day
okay so it's 3:11 kind of a hot mess
right now I'm not feeling super great I
was just laying on the hot pack right
here hence that whole situation but I'm
just gonna do a really quick check-in
and then go lay back down so it's
looking nice it's not looking ie at all
anywhere it looks really good actually
on my upper lip around my nose area and
on my forehead still pretty much looks
the same to me it's holding up pretty
well snap it on for six hours so
considering I feel like oil wise and
everything it's holding up pretty well
sorry this is a brief check-in I'm gonna
go lay back down and check back in with
you guys at the end of the night alright
so it is now seven thirty so foundations
been on for nine and a half hours now
not feeling great
these lights are kind of killer so I'm
going to make this quick I'm kind of
bummed that this is like day one sorry
this is a little bit of a downer but
hopefully tomorrow I'll be feeling good
major heat rash going on right here that
we can just not look at so first off the
shade is definitely way too dark I mean
I look freaking bronze so this side was
where I was laying on so I feel like
that kind of rubbed off the foundation
so let's just look at this side it's
definitely looking oily on the forehead
now I would say up until
the seven our point it looked really
good it was like a really it was very
soft focus it kind of had this like
airbrush effect almost it looked like a
really nice soft focus matte finish what
it says now I'm looking pretty oily so I
wouldn't say this is like super long
wearing or anything especially because I
did set this one with the powder oh man
these look it's so yeah not better on
the nose forehead looks okay just super
oily for me this is one that I would not
wear on its own I'd like a little bit
more coverage also the shade was super
dark but this is one that I feel like
would be really good mixing in with a
more full coverage foundation that's a
little bit lighter like a drop of the
Marc Jacobs remarkable or something
so we'll try mixing this one but I won't
be wearing this on its own again if you
have dry skin and you like a matte
finish this might work for you because
when it goes on it how it does have that
gel kind of feeling to it if you have
more mature skin I don't know not one
that jumps out like it would be great
for mature skin I think would just be
one that you would have to try for
yourself don't love it don't hate it I
would wear it again mixing with other
products so I would say this one is a
isn't okay I think if you're like super
into this and really excited to try it
might be worth giving it a try you can
always return it at Target if you don't
like it so hope you guys like this video
if you did and you're excited for 15
days of foundation make sure you give
this the thumbs up love you guys thanks
for watching see you tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
