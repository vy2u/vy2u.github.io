foundation alright you know what day it
is its foundation Friday this is where
we try out a new foundation every single
Friday 6:00 p.m. at the time when you
guys are seeing this I am in LA
hopefully in some sunny weather eating
some burritos tomorrow's the Meetup
Saturday April 28th from 1 p.m. to 3
p.m. at the morphe store in Brea mall
I'm gonna have all the details down
below but if you're in the LA area I
would love to meet you guys come say hey
this is the Minah for project beauty
share so the whole project Beauty share
team is gonna be there too onto the
foundation so this is a brand new
foundation from Sunday Riley and Sunday
Riley is mostly known for their skincare
that's pretty much all they're known for
I believe this is their first makeup
product he's called the influencer clean
long wear foundation so I thought it was
really awesome that they launched a
foundation Sunday Riley is known for
having good ingredients being really
high quality skincare those foundation
retails for $42 for you get one point
zero eight fluid ounces of product which
is a tiny bit more than the standard 1
fluid ounce I feel like for Sunday Riley
that's actually a pretty fair price
point I was expecting it to be a little
bit more so for a very high-end brand
it's not up there with like Giorgio
Armani but it's not as cheap as
something like clinic comes in 20 shades
I have the shade 110 which says very
fair with pink undertones the shade up
from that is fair with neutral
undertones I have more neutral
undertones but they didn't have a very
fair with neutral undertones so I just
went with 110 but says it's a clean
long-lasting foundation with medium to
full coverage doesn't dry out as a day
goes on has a satin matte finish that
stays fresh even through workouts or
humidity supposed to conceal redness
pores and dark spots without ever
looking cakey for fuller coverage you
can layer it it says it's great for all
skin types but it controls oil but it
also doesn't dehydrate your skin
apparently so on the Sephora thing where
they say what skin type is for it says
normal oiling combination and I have
more dry skin by this description saying
it controls oil it does sound like
that's more for combo skin to me Oh see
how does its cruelty free gluten free
talc free it doesn't have any kind of
synthetic fragrances or anything which I
would expect from a skincare brand like
Sunday Riley so I'm gonna search
swatches right here so you can see how
the shade at 110 compares to some
foundation's all right we've got some
swatches here so right here's the Sunday
Riley influencer foundation in the shade
110 this is supposed to have pink
undertones to me it looks like a little
bit more peachy undertones rather than
pink here's the NARS sheer glow in
Siberia NARS ultra radiant foundation
and mont blanc CYO life proof and 101
derma blend smooth liquid camo in linen
and derma called 2:08 so if you're
excited for this video and you enjoy
foundation Friday's don't forget to give
this a thumbs up if you're new here you
can join the burrito family and
subscribe I upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time
let's see how this Sunday Riley the
influencer foundation apply somewheres
throughout the day ok so it is what time
it says 8:44 in the morning I really
like the box of this it looks very sleek
and fancy so it's supposed to be medium
to full coverage satin matte finish
hoping I picked the right shade I don't
know if I should have gone with 120
because of the more neutral undertones
but we'll see squeeze to packaging with
the pump kinda reminds me of the
cosmetics CC cream kind of packaging so
let's start out with a brush on this
side of my face and I'm gonna do a
sponge like usual oh this shade might be
too light that does not look very pink
and undertone so it does have a bit of a
drag to it blending it out it's not like
gliding over my skin or anything that
shade actually is pretty close looking
at my neck I have a feeling this is one
that's gonna be going on a lot better
with a sponge oh yeah that's not looking
good on my forehead looks pretty texture
on my forehead I'm gonna smooth it over
right away with a sponge this is just
damp nothing on it
it's looking very matte I don't think I
would call this satin matte it just
looks like straight-up
matte it looks kind of just like medium
coverage and I can see it sitting on my
skin a bit but let's see how it does
going on with a sponge why is it like 85
degrees in this room right now
I can still see a lot coming through
with a sponge a solutely just toned down
my redness to me this doesn't feel
particularly lightweight or anything did
it say this is supposed to be buildable
lightweight and easily buildable and
medium to full coverage yeah I don't
know I don't really feel like it's super
lightweight huh to the touch it actually
feels kind of like lotion weird doesn't
look like that right now I don't not
like it but I also don't like it
smoothed over with this sponge it looks
a lot better it doesn't look bad I'm
gonna try and build it up since it is
supposed to be buildable I want to see
if I can cover this stuff over here and
then probably on this side too I have
used quite a bit at this point and try
and build it up with a sponge inside you
like the finish of the sponge a lot
better with this I don't think that's
built in a whole lot yeah I don't think
I would call that buildable I definitely
don't think you can get this up to full
coverage might look like it on camera to
you guys but in real life I can still
see freckles and redness and stuff
coming through on both sides okay I need
a fan in here I don't know why it's all
of a sudden a sauna shade I like finish
is okay I feel like this might be one
that kind of warms up to my skin
throughout the day because it does have
that like it feels oddly moisturizing to
the touch I don't think I would be able
to just blend powder products on top of
here since it does feel pretty like
slippery and it is transferring so I'm
gonna set just this part of my face
definitely not gonna set my forehead of
this one especially since it's targeted
more for like combo oily skin we'll see
how it does with the rest of my makeup
on so I'll be back in a few minutes
right now it's 855 I'm recording
business so it's 936 now but the
check-in time is 9 o'clock since that's
when I finished up with my face I did
set just this area with powder because
like I said it did feel like it was kind
of slippery though I definitely feel
like you need to set this one if you're
gonna be putting any kind of product on
top of it I looked out in natural
lighting I feel like it looks much more
flattering and natural lighting so I'm
going to include a clip right here so
here's the foundation of
here's foundation in natural light can
this hair chill overall I think looks
really nice the forehead I feel still
like it's making my forehead look a
little bit dry / a little bit old it's
like kind of yeah she's a little bit dry
looking up here but overall I think it
looks pretty nice zoom out and do a
flash test by the way on the days that I
do these reviews I'm not putting on an
SPF in the morning just so doesn't alter
the flash test but normally I will
underneath makeup wow it looks hella
smooth on flash it's very flattering on
the skin but does have a little bit of
flash back it looks about two shades
lighter than my neck does in the photo
in this lighting for me it makes my
forehead look a little bit dry and a
little bit old it actually looks good
right on the center but up here on some
dryness it definitely isn't looking the
best
I feel like this feels totally different
now now it feels more lightweight when I
first put it on it felt pretty heavy to
me and now I don't feel like I have a
whole lot on my face and I feel like it
looks a lot better - it's almost like
melting in a little bit and kind of
softening it has almost a I would say
it's a soft focus matte finish it does
look a little bit blurring almost which
if I'm wearing a matte foundation that's
what I'll go for so right now I'm liking
it it's grown on me we'll see how does
throughout the day but right now for a
medium coverage matte foundation so far
so good the makeup on the rest of my
face I used this Maybelline fit me
powder in 310 as a bronzer and then for
blush I used the Mac Patrick Starr I'm
not blushing and I love this blush I've
been using this a lot it has a really
pretty glow to it this shade is too dark
for me but this shade is really pretty
as a blush super pigmented so you just
need a tiny bit and then for a highlight
you use the Anastasia Anastasia
amrezy highlight which I've talked about
before but this one I use a really light
hand with this because that's kind of
look I like but you can make this very
intense but this is with a light hand
yes I feel like it's pretty Universal
I've seen this work on a lot of
different skin tones rocks my lips i use
the sephora liquid lipstick in the shade
33 and then eyes this is the first time
i've like officially tried out this
palette i think i used the black in a
different video but i haven't tried any
of the other shades
is the Anastacio soft glam palette and
oh man the shades Sienna is so beautiful
this is what's in my pretty much all
over but Sienna was like a super pretty
rich brick Brown this is like the modern
Renaissance formula she's back and I
think that's everything my usual
mascaras which are down below like I'm
forgetting something what am I
forgetting
so check-in time is 9 o'clock I'll see
you guys in a few hours and natural
lighting for the next check-in so it's
now 105 so it's been on for 4 hours and
I have been looking at my face and I
really like how here down looks it's
just my forehead it basically has been
rubbing off up here and I've had my hair
like clipped back so my hair hasn't even
been touching my forehead really it just
took it down for this it has totally
kind of rubbed off on my forehead and
it's also looking even drier up there
hopefully it's picking up but it's
basically just rubbed off up here which
is really weird
I didn't work out or anything I haven't
been doing anything strenuous so it
definitely should be staying on it just
ran a couple errands and then right here
it looks like I'm starting to crease so
I am getting a few lines right there so
I definitely don't like how it looks on
my forehead at all on the rest of my
face I feel like it looks pretty good
let's see if there's any creasing
getting my usual I've just been getting
like settling right there my upper lip
looks pretty good doesn't look like it's
creasing too bad looks good around my
nose definitely looks like a soft matte
kind of finish I like how it looks here
down it's just my forehead I'm probably
gonna look totally different in the last
check-in because I'm about to film a
second video right now and I'm gonna
like change my shirt change my lipstick
put my hair up video tricks I'm really
tempted to like touch up my forehead
right here I almost want to because we
already know I mean it's not like it's
gonna reappear right there throughout
the day cuz it's already rubbed off so
maybe we will just see if it's kind of
buildable going back in this room okay
let's see you never film with this
camera right here but see oh that's
actually like perfect height look at
that okay I'm just putting a DAB like a
tiny tiny pea-sized amount and I'm just
gonna go over right by my hairline
I'm not going to touch the center of my
forehead or anything but since this is
already rubbed off there we go looking
much better now we'll see how this does
throughout the day for the rest of the
night I'm gonna do some wardrobe
switching and lipstick switching film a
second video and I'll see you guys at
the end of the night okay so it's not
the end of the night I feel like those
eyes light I'm gonna pillow weird right
here seven o'clock so it's been on for
10 hours right now I still feel like
this part of my face looks good it's
just gotten a little bit too dry liking
for me I don't think it looks bad by any
means like there have been foundations
that have looked 50 billion times worse
on my skin I think it looks pretty good
if you're just looking at my face as
like you know a person staring at
someone's face not hardcore judging a
foundation I think overall it still
looks nice like it doesn't look bad
enough to the point where I don't think
I'd wear it again
but also I feel like this shade I don't
know it looked like it matched earlier
and now I almost feel like it's like a
half a shade to either pink or light one
or the other the undertone is a little
bit off so I think it's picking up you
can just see it's kind of clinging on to
my dryness up here and I don't like how
it looks right there and in the spots
that I touched up again it just looks
pretty dry so overall the things I don't
like just how easily it comes off and
just felt kind of lotion II feel like I
feel like it's just gonna slip off your
face if you don't set it and like I said
I didn't even touch up here and my hair
wasn't really even touching up there and
it like totally rubbed off so if you're
looking for something that's gonna
really stay on and be like transfer
proof and everything wouldn't get this
one the overall look of it for a more
matte foundation doesn't look bad I
don't think I like it quite enough to
where I would reach for it over other
foundations but it looks nice I don't
think there's anything like particularly
bad about it I do like how somehow
throughout the day it's actually felt
more lightweight maybe because it's
coming off my face if you just want
something that's matte but kind of
natural-looking and this one might be
worth giving to go if you guys have
tried this foundation like usual comment
down below your skin type and what you
thought of it and how it worked for you
don't forget la meetup is tomorrow
details are down below in the
description box I love you guys thanks
