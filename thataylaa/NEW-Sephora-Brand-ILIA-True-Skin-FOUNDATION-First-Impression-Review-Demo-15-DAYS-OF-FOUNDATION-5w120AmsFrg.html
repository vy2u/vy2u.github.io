days foundation this is why I try out a
new foundation every single day for 15
days fun fact every time I record these
intros I save like three different days
in the beginnings they don't actually
know which one is we're currently in
season five I've done four other of
these series I have playlist on each one
and all the videos by the way are
color-coded so the thumbnail if there's
a certain color in the thumbnail under
the day thing you know what season it's
in and they're also in playlists I'm
gonna leave a season fives playlist down
below today's foundation is one I have
not heard anything about this is a brand
new brand to Sephora so this is the Ilia
true serum skin foundation no true skin
serum foundation
are you missing it I like their brand
name Ilia just makes me think of illy
which makes me think of coffee which
makes me happy
I always scope out the new section on
Sephora like every single day just to
see what's coming out and this one
caught my eye because it said it's a
serum infused sound ation this equal
parts skin care and color correction I'm
coming off of acting I have dry skin so
serum foundations typically work much
better for me than something like a
matte foundation this foundation is
pricey it's $54 and you get 1 fluid
ounce such as standard the thing that I
liked about this and made me feel like
that price point was kind of justified
was when I was looking in the
ingredients the thing that stuck out to
me is the marula oil in here marilla oil
is what's in the drunk elephant oil it
also has I will leave extract mastic
which i've never heard of refines the
look of pores and naturally mattifies
works overtime to reduce the appearance
of future breakouts and it has the two
oils Merl oil and jojoba oil which kind
of scares me because my skin does not
react well to jojoba oil when used alone
just like a skin care I get close coma
Don's and I get this really weird like
roughness on my skin so I'm hoping that
this is a small enough amount of jojoba
oil that I don't get that kind of
reaction and maybe some of the other
oils and ingredients kind of work
together with that but if you think of
it as foundation plus skin care I feel
like the price point is a little bit
more justified he says it weightlessly
delivers buildable light to medium
coverage with the radiant finish she
diminishes the look of fine lines and
insures the formula effortlessly melts
into the skin for a more even luminous
glowing appearance so that sounded great
to me as I was reading it online is also
non comedogenic
vegan gluten-free and cruelty-free
downside to this is that it only comes
in ten shades not great and the deepest
shade doesn't look deep at all from what
I can tell it says medium to dark and
the lightest shade which is what I have
is Formentera
which says fair with neutral undertones
so I'm gonna insert swatches right here
so you can see how the lightest shade
compares to some of the other
foundations that I own alright lawnmower
just decided to go on outside so
hopefully you guys can't hear that but
swatch time right here is the Ilia
foundation in the lightest shade CYO
life proof in 101 NARS radiant
foundation in mont blanc derma called
2:08 tarte rainforest of the sea in
porcelain and maybelline fit me matte
and poreless in 110 just a reminder I am
alternating between drugstore and
high-end foundations so if this one is a
little bit too high up there for you
tomorrow there'll be a drugstore
foundation and there's about half half
in this whole series so if you've been
enjoying 15 days foundation so far don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up I
really appreciate it it helps me out
if you're new here you can join the
burrito family and subscribe upload
every Monday Wednesday Friday no I don't
right now I'm uploading every single day
for 15 days 6 p.m. CET time ok so right
now it's 8:30 7 in the morning
I'm really excited for this one I've
already washed moisturize and prepped my
skin I'm gonna do half my face with my
sponge half my face with my Sigma f80
brush so packaging you get a frosted
glass bottle let's see if there's a pump
oh oh oh oh wait am I just opening this
wrong wait maybe I need to pull off ok
good I got worried for a second there so
I'm gonna give this a good shake let's
put the cap back on I curled my hair
this morning with a curling iron which I
can never do I just have never gotten
the technique down and I finally found
an iron that it like glides across my
thick frigging hair I usually have to
use a wand to curl and this is the first
time I've been able to use one with like
a clamp
who's the t3y curling iron I just used
the one and a half inch attachment I
know I'm telling this right now I'm
pretty proud of myself that after 25
years I can finally use a curling iron
so there's a little bit of run to it but
it's not too runny I'm gonna start with
a brush on this side of my face so this
is supposed to be light to medium
buildable coverage blur glow blah blah
kay let's see houses
Wow very scented you can definitely
smell some kind of oil in there looks
like a pretty good shade match I think
this one might apply better with a
sponge but let's do the forehead okay
let's try this sponge on the other side
right now I'll tell you my thoughts I'm
such a strong scent it smells like
really strong skincare which makes sense
because of getting all the oils in there
I much preferred this scent to like a
perfume scent but it does smell pretty
almost like medicinal I'm getting
lighter coverage on this side but the
finish looks much better with the sponge
gonna smooth it over on my forehead with
this sponge that looks beautiful on my
forehead this side with a brush it
doesn't look nearly as good as a sponge
side coverage is light for sure but it
is supposed to be buildable I don't have
anything on my sponge right now by the
way I'm just moving this out so I'm
gonna go over and smooth out my whole
face and then try and build this up a
little bit it feels very lightweight I
don't feel like I have foundation on it
all I feel like I almost just have a
moisturizer on so let's try and build
this guy up this is one for sure that I
would use a sponge to apply looks like a
totally different foundation with a
sponge versus a brush ooh that looks
nice this is a very natural radiant
looking foundation I don't feel like I
need to build up my forehead at all the
most I would say you're gonna get this
too is about mmm low medium coverage so
I'm gonna zoom
sohere's up close it looks nice for a
natural-looking foundation this is
beautiful
it does look a bit smoothing right now
it's very dewy there's oil in it I think
the only area right now I don't love is
right around my nose it is emphasizing
my pores a little bit so this is one
that I would use my Revlon pore reducing
primer underneath before it feels like I
definitely need to set this part of my
face so I can blend my powder products
on top so I am gonna do that I'm gonna
leave my forehead alone like usual my
skin is so dry right now that my
foundation looks 50 billion times better
and it holds up throughout the day fine
without powdering my forehead so that's
why I skip out on that but I do like to
powder this area of my face just so I
can blend stuff on top of it
right now I'm liking this one I almost
reminds me of josie maran by
see with way less coverage that one has
great coverage but just the finish of it
and everything and how it's sitting on
my skin kind of reminds me of that so
it's 8:52 I'm gonna do the rest my
makeup and I'll be right back
all right so it's now nine forty one
where I can call a check-in time nine
o'clock that's actually when I finished
my face just took ten years to do the
rest of my makeup today somehow overall
I think it looks beautiful for a more
natural looking foundation the only
thing I'm not liking is somehow on my
forehead up here it's like kind of
rubbed off or something I don't know if
that happened when I took down the bangs
I was kind of going like this but I'm
just gonna take my sponge and kind of go
I don't have anything on it right now
I'm just gonna kind of like smooth out
up here and it seemed to have settled a
tiny bit into my line right there okay
but just doing that with no product on
it looks 50,000 times better so there's
no other areas right now that I'm
noticing anything looks overall pretty
good I think this one is gonna be for a
very specific person skin type look that
you're going for this is a very glowy
very moisturizing foundation it's a
serum foundation and is very light
coverage so I think this is something
that I would use probably not with this
kind of look like a full face just want
something to cover up my redness a
little bit give me some moisture to my
skin I don't think this is something
that I would wear as a right now unlike
a full-on makeup what kind of day but I
think this is definitely something that
I could also mix in with stuff to give
it a little bit more moisture so I'm
gonna start a clip right here what this
looks like out and natural lighting and
then we'll do a flash test all right
let's do a flash test shall we
it doesn't look too bad to wear wouldn't
wear it in photography on a thing
because it also it looks really nice on
the skin with flash makeup on the rest
of my face I tried out the ACE Beauty
quintessential palette this so far was
very nice I used this shade on my lid
this one to blend out that Brown and
then on my inner corner I actually used
a blush from the Pierre cosmetics for in
one blush book I use this as a blush too
but I just went in with this orange
shade right here for my inner corner
I also use this pan as blush today and
it's super pigmented so you just need a
little bit I'm gonna have to keep
playing about these not sure how I feel
about this guy yeah I laid I tried the
color pop a loose pigment thing Strub
glow and luster dust I like this it
definitely gives you a very
intensive low I had to tone this down
with powder afterwards as it was really
intense I don't like that there's some
glitter in it but the overall glow is
pretty I don't know if I would reach for
that a whole lot just because of the
glitter in it flashes I use my i lure
accents see if I can keep him on old
again this might be at 15 days of
foundation record the lip combo used
today I feel like this is gonna be one
of my new go-to nude combos I've been
really like this la girl ultimate lip
intense de liner in the shade non-stop
nude and then over top de is wet and
wild liquid katsu in new Deepa 2d one of
my favorite liquid lipsticks and I love
this combo I feel like this is perfect
not too deep not too light so that's
everything I'm wearing check-in time is
9 o'clock don't forget to vote one time
a day down below for the shelter that
you want to win $5,000 I'm going to be
doing a meet-up in that winning city so
make sure you cast your vote ok so it's
now 239 so it's been on for almost 6
hours I need to peel these latches off
my eyes are burnin I was trying to hold
off until right after this chicken looks
pretty good my creases aren't too bad at
all around my mouth or nose area for me
or head looks pretty good actually looks
a lot less dewy than it did this morning
so I think my skin is like soaking up
that oil it actually has kind of
modified a bit throughout the day and
need some kind of smoothing something
under this still I don't feel like it's
necessarily smoothing or blurring at all
I can see it on my skin but I don't not
like how it looks I think if I like I
said pathan smoothing primer probably
put on some setting spray over top
it could help out the situation but it
doesn't look bad at all let's just pull
these off now shall we
heaven like a new woman wouldn't you
take off my lashes you can see the world
we'll see you guys in a few hours at the
end of the night okay so it's not 722 so
it's been on for over 10 hours so it has
like totally mattified which is crazy
turn it off as oils moisturizing super
dewy and it has like just entirely
mattified if you have oily skin you
might like that for me I'm just at the
point where it doesn't look bad at all
burr $52 $54 whatever this was it just
doesn't look like a foundation
looks good enough on my skin that I
would want to pay that much more that
will so you can really see this it is
creasing quite a bit on my forehead I
have a few lines right here across here
it's like settling into two of my
forehead lines as my face looks fine I
definitely have a handful of foundations
that look much better on my skin for a
fraction of the price in order to wear
this again I would mix in I don't even
know what cuz it's so dewy to start with
but then it mattifies so I would have to
think of what the heck out mixes in with
probably something smoothing but kind of
more neutral I'm gonna play around with
this one I'll if do you guys in the
wrap-up video but as of right now on my
skin on dry skin I don't think this one
is worth it
if you have oily skin you might like
this one because of the way that it kind
of modified there's one ingredient in
there that actually said that it is
supposed to absorb your oil
I like help keep you Matt so I think
that ingredients organ but I hope you
guys are enjoying this series so far if
you all don't forget to give this video
a thumbs up I hope we had like a major
winter soon because I keep feeling like
I'm getting really excited about one and
then it just doesn't look the best
throughout the day so hopefully we'll
have a winner coming up we're halfway
through so there's still a lot of
chances I love you guys things oh how
are things going on I love you guys
thanks for watching see you tomorrow bye
so I'm gonna zoom literally just almost
