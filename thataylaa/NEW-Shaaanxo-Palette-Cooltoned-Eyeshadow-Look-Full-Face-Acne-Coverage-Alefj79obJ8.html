what happens when you haven't done
laundry and way too long all right so
today we have a shadow n schmooze I'm
look I'm wearing it right now
and pretty much my whole life today was
centered around the Shannon XO palate
between XO VD and just everything else
she's done I really admire Shannon so
this is like the opposite of a spring
look right now but I wanted to do
something with like the cool tones in
this palette because I feel like there
are a lot of warm tones and will
probably be a lot of looks coming out
using all the warm tones in this palette
which I think are beautiful but I just
wanted to try and do something a little
bit different so if you guys want to see
how I got this look you're in the right
place just keep watching f3 foundations
here that I haven't used in a while so
we're going to use today this is the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation I
don't think I've ever did I pre include
this I don't think I've ever include
this in a shadow mousse maybe I did when
I first come out I probably did but I'm
going to mix it in with the custom cover
drops by cover effects I love these
things I've the shade and 10 which is
really nice neutral shade these just add
coverage to pretty much anything you can
mix them in with a foundation you can
mix them in with a moisturizer a primer
anything you want sunscreen I've the
shade Y 205 in this and it is super pale
of your pale princess that will be light
enough I'm just going to add in a few
drops this because this foundation is
not nearly enough coverage for me right
now where are you going man they are
super messy like I just got that pretty
much everywhere except the bottle look
at this already washed moisturized and
primed my face protip don't try to wash
your face with a turtleneck on today use
the Smashbox primer water and to apply
this I'm using my Sigma f80 flat top
foundation brush I did post a whole
favorite makeup brushes video so if you
missed that go watch it it didn't send
out to people subscription fees so that
was kind of a bummer about reuploading
it but whatever let's just get down here
if you have acne or skin issues that you
need to cover up I think the cover
backdrops are worth the investment this
is looking really nice actually this
combo the finish is like a super nice
satin finish ok the second layer made my
face look pretty much flawless I really
like the finish of this even with two
layers it's sitting on really well
and I feel like again the coverage I
want going in with hmm
Urban Decay Naked concealer today one of
my favorites on a very tiny bit of this
down the center of my face so stuff the
under eyes going out with my stargazer
powder like usual this is five dollars
off of Amazon and it is amazing the
today's Sunday I was planning on taking
today off because I filmed an engine it
yesterday but I totally forgot that I'm
going to be not able to film for like
the next few weeks parents are coming
into town next weekend and then the
weekend after that I go to Iceland for
two weeks so we are pre filming right
now I'm not sure when this video will be
up but I may be chill in Iceland if you
want to follow along that trip you can
follow me on snapchat and Instagram
snapchat is the tail of snaps Instagram
is the tail up they gonna let the face
set a little bit I don't really feel
like applying a setting powder today so
I'm just going to do my brows and I've
gotten a lot of questions about why I
still do my brows even though I got
permanent brows I can mention that video
the shape I got I didn't want it to be a
fully filled in shape I wanted to still
be able to change the shape of my
eyebrows and like add more if I was
feeling like it so never I do a full
face of makeup with like false lashes
and everything I do like to add some
more shape to my brows when I'm just
going to work I'll just throw in some
brow gel and like a little bit of brow
product if that so that's just what I
like so I'm going with my colour-pop
brow pencil in the shade bang in
brunette love this thing and then the
older bra gel over top alright so we're
going to move on to the eyeballs so this
is the Lancome la base I've been feeling
this like over my Mac preppin or not
from prime was called Paint Pot I just
really like the way this goes on I feel
like my shadows are easy to blend on top
of it and does give a little bit of
coverage to your lids I got this self of
glam but super excited for today's eye
look because we are going in with the
Shannon XO palette Shannon clubbed with
BH Cosmetics and made this freaking
beautiful palette there are nine
eyeshadow shades like look at those nine
lipstick shades posted a picture of this
on Instagram I'm just super proud of
Shannon I've been watching Shannon for
years
this is absolutely amazing before
commenting on Instagram saying in these
with shades were super similar to the
man EMU a pellet and I think people
don't realize that like these kind of
collaborations take months and months
and months to happen I don't know but
she was probably working on this for a
good at least six months at least
probably longer than that so it's not
like the Mandy Mui palette came out and
chin like copied it and even so like
these are the popular colors right now
you look at the eyeshadow colors that
are popular right now it's these like
orange e warm tones so I'm excited for
both of them some been done with this
orange e shade right here and I'm just
using a big fluffy brush this is the
morphe e 20 7 super pretty transition
shade this reminds me of Peach Smoothie
I don't know what it is about this
primer but the eye shadows just blend
out so much easier on top of this and I
have no idea what kind of look I'm going
to go for today I'm just gonna swatch
something oh yeah look at that shade
that is so pretty
there's a super pretty duochrome shade
in here this one I kind of want to do
something with that deep chocolate brown
shade just because I feel like that's
not going to be the most reached for
color I'm actually going to start out
with this elf eyeshadow to put down
first this is socialite else pigments
these loose eyeshadows are like totally
underrated these are awesome especially
if you wet them which is what we're
going to do you get like a super pretty
metallic look someone take my Coastal
Scents s52 brush this is a nice
synthetic brush and some fix plus I can
find it I'm going to first bring my
brush with fix+
then I'm going to dip it into this
pigment and use the lid to kind of work
the shadow in and get it really metallic
and wet and then I'm just going to oh my
god do you guys see that so pretty
Thanks plus smells so good like I would
buy this in a perfume if they made it
I'm just going to bring this right up to
my crease area we're going to be
blending out the edges and everything so
don't even worry next I'm going to go in
with the dark shade in here right here
take this on a super small blending
brush this is the so8 by Coastal Scents
outer corner burst yeah I think we're
going to do like a halo eye situation so
I'm gonna put that on the inner corner
I'm gonna take an empty brushes a 250
and just turn this sideways to blend
some of those edges out of it basically
just blending that into the first
transition shade we put down for the
center of the eye I'm debating between
these two shades kind of want to do the
lighter one would that could be super
pretty though
first I'm going to go in with that rose
shade and just put that right in the
center and then if we need a little bit
lighter we can go out that other shade
oh this is so pretty the shadows are
super soft and this is a really
affordable palette my lips are like
peeling off right now what is going on
I'm down below if you guys have any
killer chap sticks or super dry lips
I've been using blistex but I feel like
it's stopped working okay I think I'm
feeling that like row shade so I'm just
going to go in with a brush and apply
some fix+ just to get it a little more
intense
super pretty I just want to like shower
in mac fix+ I'm not bringing this all
the way into the inner corner because I
do want to keep that like halo look I'm
gonna go in with the makeup geek black
liner obsidian I'm hoping this is better
than the I use the purple liner in my
stroke livestream the other night and
that one wasn't very pigmented so I hope
this is better thing get the top off
okay totally just broke the tip off
trying to get that open honestly don't
feel like sharpening that right now so
we're going to find it I'm going with
the julep black liner this is actually a
really nice waterline eyeliner when
going with that dark shade again and i'm
using the morphe m 515 which is a super
tiny brush and is great for blending out
eyeliner your shadows have like no
fallout which is really nice I'm gonna
blend this shade on the lower lash line
just to blend that out a little bit not
sure how it's gonna look cuz it's a
little shimmery but let's just go for it
okay actually really like that it gives
it a nice pinky tone under there okay so
for the bottom inner corner I'm going to
take that light shade right here spray
some fix+ and put that just on the lower
inner corner
at a2 am craving for hot cheetos last
night almost spent $10 to postmates
cheetos and the urge has come back oh
that is so pretty I almost think I could
use this shade as like a face highlight
we might try that just you guys can see
up close for a sec debating doing liquid
eyeliner right now I kind of just want
to do like intense lashes so I'm going
to go in with some mascara just code my
lashes first random thought
don't you think Hot Cheetos would be
like really good mixed in with scrambled
eggs by the way I'm not a fan of this
mascara which is why I only use it to
coat my lashes before falsies and as a
root touch-up coffee break hmm nice and
cold by the wayside now while I'm
thinking about it I made an airbnb I
mean a narrow canopy just looking at
that up
I made a posh mark the other day and I
put a ton of stuff on there so if you
guys haven't checked it out yet you can
go shop my closet but when I already
bought the dress that I wore my Mad Men
tutorial but there's a bunch of other
clothes on there I'm like addicted to
Poshmark now I found size for shoes on
there last night for lashes I think I'm
going to use the my trusty Cara s4 these
are dollar lashes and a pretty bomb
these are going to be ready to toss
after this application because what is
on here so I think I found my new
favorite lash glue there's a lot of good
stuff about the house of lashes lash
glue so ordered the mini size I got the
black version and then also clear white
version and I use this yesterday on my
eyes and I'm usually someone that has
super sensitive eyes when it comes to
lash adhesive I've tried link text where
you've tried everything and I actually
was able to keep my lashes on all day my
eyes didn't burn at all
so so far liking this lash glue I'm
going to try the dark version today
yesterday use just the clear version
alright now that we've got our lashes on
I really like how you don't have to
cover the band when you use dark lash
glue dries super fast super nice I'm
going to use Wet n Wild mega length
mascara this is my favorite bottom lash
mascara has super tiny bristles are just
easy to get in there now let us move on
to the face feels a little bit more set
right now I'm really liking the way this
foundation combo
there's no texture really showing
through but I still have full coverage
so I'm gonna use this makeup geek little
palette thing I have to contour shades
in here and I use this one the other day
I showed you guys on snapchat it looked
a little bit muddy I'm not sure if I
just applied too much but I'm going to
try this one today maybe a mix of the
two some use the warmer one first so
this looks pretty warm okay I'm going to
mix the two but I feel like that one
looks quite warm some thing about using
this shadow that's a highlight let's try
it
whew oh yeah the heck uh.okay
that is gorgeous I feel like since it's
not a super powdery eyeshadow it's
sitting really nicely on the face okay I
really like that I feel like that just
gave my face such a nice glow for blush
I'm going to try this essence silky
touch blush in the shade adorable I can
try this in a while so I don't really
member what I think about this
I'm just going to put that on the apples
oh nice I think that's a nice very
natural pink shade so for lips I kind of
want to do a light purpley grayish lip
I'm going to go digging and see what I
have I think I'm going to first go in
with color pop marshmallow and these are
their ultra satin lows which I like a
lot better than their ultra matte lips
they just feel a lot better on the lips
they're not as drying at all so if you
didn't like the matte ones try out the
satin lips these are still pretty
long-lasting did a full review on these
guys so I'll link that down below please
also mask the dryness pretty well
they'll not shade I think I'm going to
put a little bit of eyeshadow on top I
kind of want to go in with this either
the rosy gold one are there light one
and just put it in the center of my lips
I think I'm going to take that rosy gold
one just a tiny bit super pretty might
even take a tiny bit that lighter one
and just put it right on the center and
also the Cupid's bow alright so this is
the final look I feel like that was a
pretty fast
shadow mousse if you guys liked this
