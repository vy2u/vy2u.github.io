Friday it has already been a morning
today it's been quite the day I usually
film first thing in the morning it's
twelve thirty six right now one of those
days had pizza for breakfast I have to
make a PSA about matcha tea because this
is life-changing if you've never tried
matcha green-tea holy
gives you so much freaking energy
apparently it has more caffeine in it
than coffee you're welcome but today
we're going to be talking about a brand
new foundation from Tarte this is their
clay sticks foundation so this product
retails for $39 and you get 0.32 ounces
of product to give you a little bit of
comparison the Make Up For Ever stick
foundation has 0.44 and the jelly stick
foundation which I love has 0.35 so kind
of a little bit less than that comes in
twelve shades if it just counted
correctly twelve shades I associated
fair beige I definitely didn't see the
photos of the girls online or I would
not have picked up fair beige I think I
got fair beige because it says fair skin
with pink undertones the description of
the lightest shade fair neutral says
fair skin with yellow and pink
undertones and the one in between these
two shades said fair - light skin with
yellow and pink undertone so I figured
that one would be darker than fair beige
there's actually no description of this
product on Sephora at all things like
shaking in here I'm sentido I haven't
seen the packaging of this yet oh it
looks like those you know those travel
brush things when you take off the top
and then like a kabuki brush comes out
the top of this has this like so wood
thing I think that's what that supposed
to be
looks pretty outdated to me honestly the
only description on their website says
our 12-hour creamy matte clay stick
seize your appetite for weightless
natural coverage and good for you
nutrients so I've already done my usual
skin prep use my Urban Decay rehab
makeup prep hydrating gel and then my
hilum eyed primary BOCES are linked down
below in the description box so
typically my foundation videos they do
one side with a brush and one side of
the sponge since this is a stick
foundation I'm not going to try a sponge
I'm just going to try two different
brushes these are usually my go-to
brushes for stick foundations the Sigma
f80 2 round kabuki and the elf brush
that I always used for foundations I
usually have two batteries ready to go
one of them completely died in the
gone like one bar so fingers crossed
battery doesn't die in the middle this
so getting used to filming the intro
bear face I always feel like I'm
forgetting something but I think we're
good to go into the foundation so I'm
going to start swatches right here so
you can see what this shade looks like
compared to some of the other foundation
shades a down alright so swatch time
right here is the Tarte stick foundation
in the shade fair beige next over is the
makeup forever stick foundation in the
new light shade which is why 205 right
next to it is to make a fire stick
foundation again in 115 this is a pretty
close shade match for me next over is
jolie stick foundation in the shade soft
cream i have a whole video on this thing
this is the Anastasio stick foundation
in the shade porcelain and hourglass
vanish 6 foundation in alabaster so
let's just go in shall we
oooh ok that shade actually looks so far
so good I think I'm going to start out
with the Sigma brush on this side it has
a little stiffness to it as I'm trying
to blend it out I'm going to add some
more it feels super lightweight like you
can't really feel it but also at the
same time has a little bit of a drag to
it
ok this shade looks nothing like the
photo of the girl I'll insert it right
here I think this might be too light for
me right now but I always would rather
go too light so I can warm it up with
like powder and bronzer and stuff than
too dark so far I would say this looks
like natural kind of medium coverage you
can still see my freckles coming through
it did a pretty good job of covering my
acne though to give you an idea of which
stick foundations I like and don't like
I am all about to make up forever stick
foundation I think it's beautiful I
absolutely hate the Anastasio stick
foundation and hourglass advantage stick
foundation I've reviewed on both of
those products if you miss them as I'm
blowing this out it almost is one of
those that kind of warms up to your skin
and melts out a little bit so far is
looking pretty good
yeah well this shade I'm confused okay
so let's try the elf brush on this side
okay so literally right as I put on that
side of my face the battery died so I
blended it out so it wasn't just stuck
there in stripes so we have a solid two
bars a battery right now hopefully I can
finish this off before it dies again I
left my forehead so we can blend it out
on this side with elf brush but
basically
it blended out pretty much the same as a
Sigma brush I do prefer the Sigma brush
a little bit better with this one though
the elf one I just found was a tiny bit
streaky
charging for about 35 minutes style so
everything has been on for a 35 minutes
already and it's looking super dewy the
top of this almost looks like melted and
that's kind of the way it feels blending
out it's almost like when you have your
stick foundation in a hot car and then
go to put it on it just kind of melts
but without a powder on right now
looking up close it looks really nice I
have no major complaints right now I
would say this is high medium coverage
I'm definitely going to set my whole
face with this so I can darken my face a
bit but also it just looks like I'm
going to get super oily since it already
looks very dewy so else 1:24 I'm going
to go ahead and put on my concealer
powder and the rest of my makeup and
I'll be right back
alright so it's now 144 so I'm just
going to call it second time 1:45 and
now that my powder is on I use the it
coz are you kidding me battery is
flashing again I just think it's going
to take me four hours to film alright so
I decided to come out here natural
lighting and just show you guys on my
blog camera it is powder my face with a
cosmetic celebration foundation
illumination I love this powder and I
love the way that this went on on top of
this foundation it just still looks very
skin like luminous but not overly dewy
at this point I think now with the
powder it matches my neck pretty well it
still looks a little bit off maybe like
a bit yellow but I think it's definitely
doable now giving you guys in so you can
see what it looks like up close I think
it looks really great right now it just
looks really nice and smooth it's not
clinging anywhere I think this one would
be good for dry skin it definitely feels
pretty moisturizing it's not clinging on
any dry patches on my forehead right now
right now I'm definitely liking this one
I'm going to call the second time 1:45
tell you guys what's on the rest of my
face contour I use the naked skin
shapeshifters new by Urban Decay this
one I love the tone of it it's just so
frickin pigmented and not in a good way
it's really hard to get like a natural
kind of look with this I've tried using
stippling brushes I've tried literally
barely tapping the brush in it is just a
bit too pigmented in my opinion but I
love the color of it you start Dollface
blush which is one of my favorites Mac
soft and gentle highlight I haven't used
this in years it's like this gold kind
of highlights and on my list is makeup
forever
2:03 and then my eyes is Urban Decay
Naked 2 palette and just
winged liner so that is that I hope this
video is somewhat cohesive because I
feel like it's been all over the place
so I'm going to go finally get some work
done to get this day started usually the
next reckon I do is the natural lighting
so see you guys back here in a few hours
alright so it's now seven oh what's
seven oh nine so the Foundation's been
on for a little over five hours yeah for
only being on for five hours it's
already starting to break down a bit
when you get really up closer than you
guys in is starting to kind of separate
a bit and around my nose it looks pretty
heavy as you can see around my nose area
it is not looking too great but just as
kind of like separating on my upper lip
- and I also noticed it's separating
getting kind of cracky around this area
on my acne I feel like you can get a
better picture here of how luminous this
is it's kind of where as usual for me I
like the eight-hour point but five hours
is pretty early we'll see how this lift
by the end of the night right now on my
skin with that powder at least is not
long-lasting by any means I don't even
think I got a good few hours wear out of
it so we'll see by the end of the night
how this thing is looking okay so it's
now 10:45 so Foundation salon for nine
hours I'm ready to wash my face get into
bed I think it is safe to say the
foundation looks pretty horrible which I
kind of had a feeling after that last
check-in but it's basically taking up
breaking down separating creasing in
every possible area my eyes are super
red right now don't know why but I feel
like it's actually looking better on
camera yeah feel like you can't totally
see it oh there we go I mean yeah I you
can see all around my nose area I also
feel like I'm breaking out like I wasn't
breaking out around here this morning
but it's pretty much worn off on my
upper lip and then it's just totally
gathering in certain areas and I'm
pretty oily so yeah it looks pretty bad
so I actually like the way this one
looks when it first goes on after
literally about a couple hours it just
majorly goes downhill at least on my
skin maybe if you have dry skin I swear
better on me it's just kind of
one of those foundations that's hot mess
we'll try this with a different powder
to see if it makes a difference it could
have just been the powder but right now
it's not looking promising so I hope you
guys found this video helpful if you did
make sure you give a thumbs up I love
you guys thanks for watching
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
