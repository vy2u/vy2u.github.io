days of foundation this is why I try out
a new foundation every single day for 15
days
today were trying out a 4 again $85
foundation $85 I'm pretty sure that's
the most expensive foundation I've ever
bought besides the what brain was at the
powder foundation that I tested I'll
link that one in the eye over here if
you missed that I was scrolling on
Sephora's new arrivals saw this
foundation this the Tom Ford waterproof
foundation and concealer and got really
curious
you get one fluid ounce of product in
here there was nothing else in the box
no tickets to The Ellen Show cars
awaiting me rainbows burritos just
foundation for $85 so this only comes in
12 shades and I have the lightest shade
1.5 cream since it starts out 1.5 I'm
guessing they're gonna expand the shade
range to go lower and hopefully higher
it goes up to 10 point note chestnut so
not a huge shade range to start out but
this is a new foundation it says it's a
full coverage waterproof foundation that
also functions as an effective concealer
to hide noticeable imperfections
comfortable breathable foundation with a
naturally radiant foot what finish says
it's supposed to cover blemishes on the
skin and it says it's good for all skin
types so there's only three reviews on
Sephora so far as this thing is brand
spankin new I've got to say the
packaging is a little disappointing to
me for $85 I don't know I know it's just
a squeeze tube and there's not a whole
lot you can do with that but it just
seems very basic even like the calf and
stuff doesn't feel particularly good
quality it just kind of feels like cheap
plastic I found great product drugstore
and high-end if something is $85 for me
it really has to be out of this world
because I do have foundations under $15
that are freaking amazing this is gonna
have to do some mind-blowing I'm gonna
cert swatches right here so you can see
how this shade 1.5 cream compares to
some of the other foundations I own all
right I'm right here is the Tom Ford
Foundation concealer in the shade of 1.5
cream this has already oxidized
about two shades since i swatched it
when I first put it on it was very close
to the Urban Decay Naked Foundation in
0.5 next overs derma called 2:08 again
this one's Urban Decay Naked 0.5 josie
maran vibrancy foundation in RG 5 and
pur cosmetics bear doll foundation
in porcelain so if you've missed any of
days one through seven those are linked
down below in a playlist if you've been
enjoying 15 days of foundation don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up
let's put this on my face if you want to
see what I think of the Tom Ford
waterproof foundation and concealer if
it's worth $85
you're in the right place just keep
watching since it says this is a
foundation and concealer I'm thinking
that the consistency of this is gonna be
a little bit on the thicker side so I'm
probably gonna use my Sigma f80 too now
on the other side of my face I'll use my
damp sponge when I clip back the hair
I've already washed moisturize and
primed all right squeeze this thing out
whoa it's actually pretty liquidy I'm
not expecting that I might actually
switch brushes and I think I'm gonna go
in with Sigma f80 instead for the brush
side with the sponge on this side is not
actually covering all of my acne you can
definitely still see it coming through
but it does look like nice high medium
coverage right now definitely not like
derma call total blackout kind of
coverage ever since my dad says block
out referring to foundation in the
videos that we've done I started saying
it looks like a pretty matte finish I'm
gonna use the same amount try the other
side with a brush I actually used a
decent amount of product I think you
guys saw how much I had on there but
about a dime-size definitely better
coverage with the brush I would called
that full coverage is still not derma
call kind of coverage but it is covering
a lot more on this side with a brush
we're gonna go over the other side a
little bit to see if I can build this up
okay so that built up beautifully feel
like I've got a little bit better
coverage and it doesn't look heavy at
all it's sitting really nicely on my
skin right now my face looks pretty
matte I mean my forehead I'm getting
like a little bit more of a glow but I
wouldn't really call this a radiant
finish since this is supposed to be a
concealer - I'm gonna take my finger and
see if I can use this as like a spot
concealer to cover up just the acne
spots that are still showing I feel like
that took away some of my coverage yeah
that doesn't do a whole lot as a
concealer if you have like heavy duty
things to cover not really covering him
I wouldn't say it's like the most
flattering as far as texture but it also
doesn't look bad don't think about this
that I'm not totally loving I think I
would go through this pretty quickly to
get the kind of coverage that they say
it is and I used pretty much two layers
a shade is a little bit off it looks
fine but you can definitely
the line on my neck right here okay well
I'm gonna ply the rest of make up right
now is 855 let's call the check-in time
nine o'clock since that's about when
I'll finish up my face makeup not sure
if I'm gonna powder this one I'm kind of
thinking I am I don't know we'll see I'm
gonna do the rest of makeup and I'll be
right back okay so it's now nine forty
two I took my sweet time doing my makeup
today we're gonna call a check-in time
nine o'clock since that's when I
finished up my face makeup ended up
setting my face with my Laura Geller
bouncing Brighton powder in the shade
porcelain this definitely helped to make
the shade look closer to my actual body
overall I definitely like how it's
looking better with this powder on now I
still wouldn't say I absolutely love how
it looks like foundation on its own I
try to think of what it reminded me of
and it's almost like Mac Studio Fix like
you can just kind of see it doesn't look
bad it doesn't look good you can just
kind of see it on your face it looks
kind of like Foundation and it did
darken a little bit on its own so I
would say this shade is too dark for me
without a powder or something to lighten
it so if you're around my skintone 1.5
might be too dark but with the powder on
right now I think it looks fine there's
nothing majorly like standing out good
or bad on the rest of my face whereas I
use the Shayla Maybelline city mini
palette and this thing is really nice
I've tried some of the other city mini
palettes I think as I was it's called
yeah city mini this one was really kind
of hit or miss there were some really
nice shades and also some not great
shades every one of the shades I used in
this one was really nice they blend it
out really easily pigmented soft I
really like this lashes were pure diva I
really like this lip color too today
this is the L'Oreal infallible mattes in
the shade tongue-tied super pretty I
really like the tone and shade of this I
was gonna use this as a bronzer but it
was like straight-up orange I use this
as a blush kind of this is the Milani
globe baked bronzer to just kind of
deepen up my cheeks a little bit I went
out with the bare minerals contour face
highlight is Becca champagne pop I'm
forgetting something I think that's
everything
the next Jack and I do will be natural
lighting I'll see you guys in a few
hours okay so right now it's 211 so it's
been on for about five hours
both flashes are goners I put on my 15
days foundation t-shirt from last season
I've just been doing laundry and
cleaning so not trying to wear like a
silk shirt while I do that but let's
talk about the foundation so it actually
looks pretty good like I like how it's
looking on my forehead that powder on
top I like the shade of it there is some
major creasing on my upper
whip so like huge lines right here but
five hours in my forehead looks pretty
good I think it looks better actually
and when I first put it on kind of
smoothed out a little bit it doesn't
look quite as textured I'll see you guys
at the end of the night all right so
it's now eight o'clock my phone just
died so you're just gonna have to trust
me
my face looks freaking good right now
there's still a little bit of natural
light out right now so I'm standing
right in front of the window so I think
you guys will be able to see for 11
hours like it looks pretty damn good
especially my forehead I'm gonna zoom
you guys in my forehead looks the same
as it did about five hours in so for
having this on for 11 hours that's crazy
I still don't like how it looks around
my nose area and upper lip definitely
still creasing and stuff but overall it
looks really good like it's held up
really well throughout the day
this one is confusing to me because I
loved how it held up throughout the day
but I definitely don't like how it looks
without the powder I used and it was too
dark without the powder I used so I
think this might be a good mixing one
for me because I rarely have my skin
hold up as well for this long this is
like a little bit crazy
is it worth $85 to use as a mixing
foundation I don't know but again if I
can just use like third of the amount
that I used before and mix it in with
another foundation maybe it would be
worth it I'm pretty impressed with the
longevity of this one
what's a mile I was just looking at
trips for like two hours
I found this Turkish boat sailing trip
come on go on how does this relate to
something being in my eye I have no idea
$85 is freaking insane for a foundation
but if my face looks this good by the
end of the day I don't know that could
be worth it do you like it do you think
it's worth eighty five dollars so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you did
