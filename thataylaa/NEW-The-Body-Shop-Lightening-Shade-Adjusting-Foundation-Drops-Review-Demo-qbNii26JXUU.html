talking about one of my favorite things
on planet Earth foundation Leitner's how
many people have said that sentence so I
just filmed a review on the Maybelline
master contour kit I think that video
will be up after this video so if you're
new to my channel make sure you
subscribe it'll notify you every time I
put up a new video and we can be friends
I just recharged got the girls mug there
we go
foundation light nurse if you've been
following my channel for a while you
know that one of my holy grail products
is Manic Panic dreamtone this is
basically one of the more affordable
foundation liners that I've found I have
a whole review on this how to lighten
your foundations I've used this in
probably like 30 to 40 different videos
this is one of my absolute Holy Grail
products it is a lifesaver if you have
pale skin and have a difficult time
getting your foundation to match your
neck we all know the struggle foundation
mixers and foundation Leitner's are not
a new concept we have quite a few right
here I found about 10 to 15 different
foundation mixers and Leitner's mixing
white in with foundations is not a new
concept is basically like painting you
mix in lighter shade to get the color
that you want I do applaud the body shop
and every other company who has come out
with a foundation mixer for recognizing
that there are more than eight shades of
skin tones Sony's came out I think it
was a couple months ago now I jumped on
this bandwagon I literally bought it the
day that they went on sale
I've been trying this out for about a
month now I know why all of a sudden
this is like resurfacing on Instagram
and stuff but these have been out for a
while now
I've been getting a lot of questions
from you guys about my thoughts on this
so here we go I did do a demo in this
video showing you how it mixes with
foundations and swatches and things like
that you want to see my thoughts on this
product you're in the right place just
keep watching this retails for $20 and
you get 15 milliliters or half with half
a fluid ounce of product just for
comparison you get one fluid ounce of
product and Manic Panic and this is
about half the price you can get this
for between like nine and twelve dollars
on Amazon so this is almost double the
price half the product the actual shade
of these it's a little bit different
this one is definitely more pure white
so the applicator on this is a dropper
kind of situation that is pretty much
useless you can actually get product out
easier by just dipping it in and kind of
waiting for it to drop off or rubbing it
on the back of a pallet the dropper kind
of just blurts out product and it starts
bubbling they don't have too many claims
on their website they just say it's a
lightening product and that you only
need one drop to lighten your whole face
of foundation for me being super pale
that is not enough product at all to
lighten my foundation I need a good 5
drops this at least to do any kind of
major lightening that being said I do
use a lot of foundation on my face since
I like full coverage
I usually go in with about one and a
half layers of foundation so if you're
someone who does like a light
application a foundation you might only
need a couple drops of this it also
obviously depends what shade of
foundation you're starting with so in
the demo I use the elf acne fighting
foundation which is pretty dark I've
tried this with probably ten different
foundations with every foundation I've
tried there is not one that I've only
needed one drop to lighten it super
sensitive acne prone skin this doesn't
make me break out which is really nice I
love the cover FX custom cover drops but
those unfortunately definitely break me
out if cover FX came out with the cover
drops in a white shade the whole makeup
world would be changed forever as far as
how they actually mix in with product I
do feel like these mix in a little bit
more seamlessly than the Manic Panic
dreamtone this changes the formula of
your foundation less than the Manic
Panic for sure however I feel like the
Manic Panic does a lot better job of
lightening it if you need to lighten
your foundation a few shades I would go
for Manic Panic if you're only trying to
like slightly address the shade of your
foundation and you're only going to be
using a drop or two of this this is a
good option kind depends on what you're
willing to spend and how much lightening
actually you need to do I do wish they
made this a little bit more pigmented
they do have a dark main shade as well
so if you have issues finding
that are dark enough for your skin tone
then this could be an option for you
Manic Panic doesn't make a darkening one
as far as I know let's go into the demo
so you guys can see how it makes this
and how it applies and all that good
stuff okay so my skin is clearly pretty
horrible right now I have some major
breakouts going on down here
I've been trying out a ton of new face
products and I think my skin is just
reacting and kind of freaking up I have
the shade adjusting drops right here
we're going to mix it in with the elf
acne fighting foundation this is their
lightest shade porcelain and it is
pretty dark so we're going to put this
to the test if you're going to be mixing
you can always use the back of a bath &amp;amp;
Bodyworks candle that I use for a mixing
palette hell is dry we're going to go
ahead and I'm just going to squirt some
of the elf foundation on here start with
that and we going with the drop so you
want to shake them before you use it
they say you only need one drop to
lighten your foundation that is a
definite false statement so that was one
drop I'm going to go ahead and put three
if we can get it out come on okay there
we go
so definitely lightened it but it's not
even close to how light we need it for
my skin tone so I'm going to go ahead
and put about two more drops in the
dropper just really doesn't work it
almost is better just dipping it in and
kind of rubbing it on the side of the
palate okay so that's how much more I
put in just for a reference when I use
Manic Panic dreamtone with this
foundation I only need about a pump okay
I put in one more draw I feel like it's
doing more of like neutralizing the
orange tones rather than actually
lightening it feel like that's all we
should do so I'm going to go ahead and
apply this to my face I'm trying out
this Coastal Scents brush for the first
time this is foundation brush I really
liked their eye brush they tried so I
went ahead and purchased a couple more
brushes they're super affordable and so
far really I'm liking them
I feel like this is doable for my
skintone it's definitely not as light as
I can get with the Manic Panic I blend
that dungeon you know I'm saying okay so
this is how light
we got the foundation I'm going to do is
swatch on my arm of the elf foundation
on its own and then the mix shade that
we got just so you guys can see how much
it actually lightened up okay so right
here we have the elf acne fighting
foundation this is mixed in with about
five drops of the lightening drops don't
mind my burn mark right there right here
we have again the elf acne fighting
foundation and then this is mixed in
with about half a pump of Manic Panic so
I definitely feel like the Manic Panic
lightened it more and you have to use
way less product this one does change
the formula less than the Manic Panic
but if you're looking for something
that's really going to help lightening
it I would go with this one is it worth
it if you're a foundation junkie and you
like testing out new products like this
I think it's worth a try to see if you
like better than the Manic Panic in my
opinion for being double the price it's
just not worth it to me I will continue
to repurchase my Manic Panic I probably
won't be repurchasing this again if
you're new to my channel I have tons of
videos for pale skin because I have it
leave a playlist in the description box
below with all of my foundation reviews
for pale skin hopefully I helped some of
you guys if you guys liked this video

thumbs up so I know love you guys thanks
